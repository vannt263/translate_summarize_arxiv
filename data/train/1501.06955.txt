    "the markoff equation @xmath3 occurs in various settings and has been well studied by many authors in different contexts ( actually markoff studied the equation @xmath4 , the triples of positive integer solutions are called markoff triples , but this is equivalent to ( [ eqn : markoff ] ) by the change of variables @xmath5 ) . as a diophantine equation , the triples of positive integer solutions have interpretations in terms of diophantine approximations , minima of binary quadratic forms and traces of simple closed geodesics on the modular torus , see @xcite for an excellent survey .",
    "a basic theorem of markoff states that the set of ( non - trivial ) integer solutions of ( [ eqn : markoff ] ) can be obtained from the fundamental solution @xmath6 by considering its orbit under the action of the group @xmath7 of polynomial automorphisms of ( [ eqn : markoff ] ) . here",
    "@xmath7 is generated by the permutations , the even sign change automorphisms ( where two of the variables change signs ) and the involution @xmath8 given by @xmath9    more generally , @xmath10 parametrizes @xmath11 the character variety of the free group on two generators @xmath12 into @xmath13 , where the parameters are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the variety described by ( [ eqn : markoff ] ) parametrizes the relative character variety @xmath17 \\in { \\rm hom}(f_2 , { \\mathrm{sl}(2,{\\mathbb c})})/\\!/{\\mathrm{sl}(2,{\\mathbb c})}~|~{{\\hbox{tr}\\,}}(aba^{-1}b^{-1})=-2\\},\\ ] ] see @xcite . in this context",
    ", @xmath7 is commensurable to the action of @xmath18 on the ( relative ) character variety , and the basic theorem of markoff can be interpreted as saying that the set of positive markoff triples is the orbit of the root triple @xmath6 under the action of @xmath18 ( cohn @xcite was the first to notice the connection between the markoff triples and traces of simple geodesics on the modular torus ) .",
    "various subsets of the character variety have interpretations as fricke spaces of geometric structures ( for example the real points on ( [ eqn : markoff ] ) except the origin correspond to hyperbolic structures on a once - punctured torus ) , and @xmath18 acts properly discontinuously on these subsets .",
    "on the other hand , other subsets have interpretations as representations of @xmath19 into @xmath20 and results of goldman @xcite imply that @xmath18 acts ergodically on these subsets .",
    "hence , the overall action of @xmath7 on @xmath10 is dynamically interesting and quite mysterious .",
    "hurwitz @xcite generalized the study to the @xmath21-variable diophantine equation @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 ) , and obtained analogous results to those for the markoff equation .",
    "in particular , he showed that there are a finite set of basic solutions of ( [ eqn : markoff - hurwitz1 ] ) such that all integral solutions can be obtained by considering the orbits of these basic solutions under a certain group action . by a simple change of variables by a homothety @xmath24",

    "we state here three general questions which we address in this paper : question 1 .",
    "what is the group of polynomial automorphisms of @xmath0 preserving the markoff - hurwitz polynomial ( [ eqn : markoff - hurwitz ] ) ?",
    "question 2 .",
    "how can we describe invariant open subsets of @xmath0 on which this group acts properly discontinuously ( domains of discontinuity ) ?",
    "these sets would be analogues of teichmller or fricke spaces , and the quotient under the group action the analogues of various moduli spaces .",
    "question 3 .",
    "what can we say about the orbits of points in the domain of discontinuity , in particular , what is their growth rate and do they satisfy some identities ?",
    "this question is motivated by results of mcshane @xcite who proved a remarkable identity for once - punctured hyperbolic tori which can be interpreted as an identity satisfied by the markoff triples , and more generally , triples of real numbers satisfying ( [ eqn : markoff ] ) .",
    "this was generalized by bowditch @xcite , tan - wong - zhang @xcite and hu - tan - zhang @xcite in the context of the group action on @xmath10 preserving ( [ eqn : markoff ] ) .",
    "the natural question here is whether these identities generalize for @xmath0 , @xmath28 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to give answers to the above questions . for question 1",
    ", we have the following ( compare to @xcite which considers the case @xmath27 ) :    [ thm : polyauto ] the group of polynomial automorphisms of @xmath0 preserving the markoff - hurwitz polynomial @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 where    1 .",

    ", this is equivalent to studying the action of @xmath44 on @xmath0 , since @xmath43 is a normal subgroup of finite index in @xmath44 .",
    "the group @xmath43 is easier to handle as it is a coxeter group generated by @xmath21 involutions with no other relations , and the cayley graph @xmath45 of @xmath43 is a regular ( edge - labeled ) , rooted @xmath21-valence tree .",
    "the vertex set @xmath46 consists of the elements of @xmath43 ( with root the identity element @xmath47 ) and the edge set @xmath48 is labeled by @xmath49 ; two vertices @xmath50 are connected by an @xmath51-edge if and only if @xmath52 . for any subtree @xmath53 ,",

    "furthermore , because of the edge relations , @xmath62 is determined by its value on any vertex , in particular , the root ; so the set of vector - valued hurwitz maps can be identified with @xmath0 .",
    "we next describe an important set of geometric objects , the alternating geodesics ( or 2-regular subtrees of @xmath45 ) , which will play an important role in describing the domain of discontinuity , as well as the identities",

    "choose arbitrary @xmath900 with @xmath901 , then we have @xmath902 where the infinite sums converge absolutely .",
    "the proof is essentially the same as the proof of theorem [ thm : identity ] . instead of assigning the same weight @xmath903 to all @xmath91 ,",
    "we assign the weight @xmath904 to @xmath79",
    ".    we also have the following relative version of the identities , in the case where @xmath107 may not satisfy the bowditch conditions ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) , but they are satisfied for a subset @xmath905 for some @xmath107-directed edge @xmath906 .",
    "essentially the same proof yields the following :    for @xmath470 and @xmath153 , let @xmath907 .",

    "then @xmath910 where the infinite sum on the right side converges absolutely .",
    "in particular when @xmath114 , we have @xmath911    with the above proposition and following the computations in the proof of proposition 2.9 of @xcite , we can show that still holds when @xmath912 for a finite number of @xmath913 , thus the identity in theorem [ thm : identity ] holds as well in such conditions .",
    "there are many interesting questions and directions to be explored .",
    "we list some below :    1 .",
    "foremost perhaps is the question of whether the sets @xmath94 defined , and the identities derived here have interesting geometric interpretations in terms for example of hyperbolic surfaces or other geometric objects .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the case @xmath27 is well studied and corresponds to the character variety of @xmath19 , and the original mcshane identity , the case @xmath98 also has the interesting interpretation in terms of the fricke space of the thrice - punctured projective plane from the work of huang - norbury .",
    "the geometry of the regular subtrees @xmath405 for @xmath914 and the extended hurwitz map on these sets is an interesting topic",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the geometric picture of the siepinski simplices we discussed for @xmath915 generalizes to these objects , and if the extended hurwitz maps have interesting properties which characterize them , for example , edge relations etc .",
    "3 .   in this paper",
    ", we described a non - empty open subset @xmath94 of @xmath0 on which @xmath43 acts properly discontinuously .",
    "a natural question is if this is the largest open subset with this property .",
    "other basic properties of this set are also unknown , for example if this set is connected , if the boundary is always fractal - like , etc .",
    "restriction of the action to @xmath125 or other subfields is also interesting .",
    "one could also look at the subset of hurwitz maps which are fixed by some element of @xmath43 , that is , for which @xmath916 for some @xmath917 . in this case",
    ", the bowditch conditions will not be satisfied but we can define relative bowditch conditions similar to @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the action of @xmath43 on the complement of the closure of @xmath94 seems quite mysterious and worth exploring . of interest for example",
    "would be if there exists some easily defined subset on which the action of @xmath43 is ergodic .",
    "finally , the methods described in this paper are fairly general and it would be interesting to see if they can be applied to for example the study of apollonian circle / sphere packings where a similar group action is observed .",
    "horowitz in @xcite studied the group of polynomial automorphisms of @xmath918 preserving the polynomial @xmath919 here we extend the study and give the proof of theorem [ thm : polyauto ] .",
    "it is clear that the elements of @xmath43 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are polynomial automorphisms of @xmath0 preserving the markoff - hurwitz polynomial @xmath920 , thus the group generated by these elements is a subgroup of @xmath44 . to complete the proof ,",
    "we need to show the other inclusion . let @xmath921 be an arbitrary element @xmath922 where @xmath923 are polynomials in @xmath924 , @xmath925 of degree @xmath926 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath927 keeps invariant the polynomial @xmath920 , we have @xmath928 we observe that the degree of the right - hand side polynomial is @xmath21 and the degree of the left hand side polynomial is not great than @xmath929 . in the following , we follow the method in @xcite and decompose polynomials into sums of homogeneous polynomials , that is , @xmath930 where @xmath931 is the sum of the monomials of degree @xmath77 in @xmath932 , that is , the homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath77 in @xmath932 .    we prove by induction on the highest degree of @xmath927 .",
    "note that by applying permutation automorphisms , we can always assume @xmath933 .",
    "furthermore , we know that if one of the polynomials @xmath923 is of degree zero , i.e just a constant , then @xmath927 is not an automorphism of @xmath934 .",
    "thus we have @xmath935 for all @xmath51 .",
    "first suppose @xmath936 , i.e. @xmath927 is a linear automorphism",
    ". then implies @xmath937 by comparing the highest terms on both sides .",
    "thus by unique factorization , the polynomials @xmath938 are @xmath939 with @xmath940 and @xmath941 . by composing with a permutation",
    ", we can assume that @xmath942 comparing the degree @xmath503-terms of implies @xmath943",
    ". then @xmath944 and @xmath941 , that is the automorphism is a sign - change automorphism .",
    "therefore we have proved that the group @xmath31 of linear automorphisms of @xmath0 preserving @xmath920 is generated by elements of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath945 and @xmath946 is trivial , so @xmath947 .",
    "it is also clearly finite .",
    "now we may assume @xmath948 .",
    "here we claim that @xmath949 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath950 , then @xmath951 is the only non zero homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath952 in the left - hand side of , which implies that can not be true ; or else , if @xmath953 , then @xmath954 is the only non zero homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath955 in the left - hand side of , which also implies that can not be true either .",
    "therefore , @xmath949 and the terms of degree greater than @xmath21 in the left - hand side of must cancel .",
    "the sum of terms of highest degree on the left - hand side of is @xmath956 , thus @xmath957 .",
    "now consider the following polynomial automorphism of @xmath934 @xmath958 which is the composition @xmath959 .",
    "we can check that the maximal degree of the above polynomials @xmath960 is strictly less than @xmath961 .",
    "therefore by induction , @xmath959 , and hence @xmath927 are both generated by elements in @xmath43 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
