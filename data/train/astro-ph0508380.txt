    "the canonical picture of low - mass star formation is that of a rotating , collapsing cloud of dust and gas that forms a protostar surrounded by a disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "different stages of this theoretical evolutionary process have been equated with observed differences in the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of protostellar objects , which have been grouped into classes 0-iii based on their infrared spectral index and the ratio of sub - millimeter to bolometric luminosity @xcite . in this classification scheme ,",
    "class 0 and i sources are still in the main accretion phase , and emit most of their radiation at far - ir and submm wavelengths due to reprocessing of light from the central protostars by dust grains in an infalling envelope .",
    "in contrast , class ii and iii sources exhibit directly revealed pre - main - sequence stars in addition to emission from circumstellar disks .",
    "this classification scheme is an attempt to represent discretely a continuous evolutionary sequence , and there are transition objects that create some blur between classes .",
    "moreover , this sequence is defined solely from spatially unresolved seds , which contain only limited information about the circumstellar distributions .",
    "thus , it is not clear that the observed differences in seds truly correspond to evolutionary changes in the circumstellar geometry .",
    "a crucial test is to constrain the geometry of material around members of these different evolutionary classes using spatially resolved images , and thereby either confirm or refute the evolutionary sequence inferred from spatially unresolved seds .",
    "direct imaging of class ii sources has shown that the bulk of the circumstellar material lies in disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while there may be a small amount of material in tenuous envelopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , class ii sources appear to be fully - assembled young stars surrounded by rotating disks from which they continue to accrete material .",
    "direct images of the less evolved class i sources are relatively rare , due to the large extinctions to these embedded objects , and thus the circumstellar geometry for these objects is not well constrained .",
    "studies of the emergent spectral energy distributions at wavelengths @xmath1 @xmath0 m have provided important , albeit ambiguous , constraints on the circumstellar dust distributions for class i objects .",
    "models incorporating infalling , rotating , envelopes with mass accretion rates on the order of @xmath2 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 are consistent with observed seds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the compatibility of the derived mass accretion rates with statistically - inferred ages of class i sources @xcite provides further support for these envelope models . however , for some objects whose seds can be explained by spherically - symmetric dust distributions , it has been suggested that nearly edge - on flared disk models may also be able to reproduce the observed seds @xcite .",
    "observations that spatially resolve the circumstellar emission are necessary to remove the ambiguities inherent in sed - only modeling .    the circumstellar geometry is constrained directly by spatially resolved images .",
    "scattered light at near - ir wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with asymmetric emission morphologies observed in some sources , provides strong evidence that the circumstellar material is not spherically distributed around class i objects .",
    "however , since scattered light traces tenuous dust in the surface layers of circumstellar dust distributions , it does not allow an unambiguous determination of geometry or other circumstellar properties .",
    "for example , while spherically - symmetric dust distributions can be ruled out , we show below that modeling of scattered light alone can not necessarily distinguish between a flattened envelope and a flared disk .",
    "modeling of images at multiple wavelengths can provide tighter constraints on geometry , since emission at different wavelengths arises in different layers of the circumstellar material , with short - wavelength scattered light from low - density surface layers and longer - wavelength emission from deeper , cooler layers at larger radii .",
    "for the class i source l1551 irs 5 , spatially resolved observations at several wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and detailed spectroscopy @xcite have been combined with sed modeling , providing important additional constraints on the models @xcite . moreover , the combination of low and high resolution millimeter observations facilitated distinction of compact disk emission and more extended envelope emission",
    ". similar modeling of multi - wavelength observations for iras 04302 + 2247 provided firm constraints on the distribution of circumstellar material and the properties of the circumstellar dust grains @xcite .    to further our understanding of the class i population as a whole ,",
    "we have obtained high spatial resolution observations of five additional class i sources at multiple wavelengths which , when combined with seds , enable much tighter constraints on circumstellar dust models than available from any single dataset .",
    "we present images of scattered light at 0.9 @xmath0 m and thermal emission from dust at 1.3 mm .",
    "in addition , we augment seds compiled from the literature with new photometry at 0.9 @xmath0 m , 18 @xmath0 m , 1.3 mm , and 3 mm wavelengths . using the three dimensional radiative transfer code mc3d @xcite , we model our data in the context of three types of circumstellar dust distributions : 1 ) rotating infalling envelopes ; 2 ) flared disks ; and 3 ) combinations of envelopes+disks .",
    "the best fits are obtained for models incorporating both an envelope and an embedded disk , although we show that pure disks or envelopes can reproduce certain aspects of our data . for each source",
    ", we discuss the properties of the best - fit models , including the geometry of the dust distributions and implied mass accretion rates .",
    "we use these results to help place class i sources in the proper evolutionary context .",
    "finally , we discuss refinements to the models that may improve agreement with observed multi - wavelength data , and describe new constraints that will become available from upcoming millimeter and infrared facilities .",
    "our sample consists of five class i sources in the taurus star forming region drawn from the larger sample of protostars studied by @xcite .",
    "this subset was selected based on three criteria : 1 ) sources must be detected at red optical wavelengths ( @xmath5 jy ) , 2 ) this emission must appear resolved , and 3 ) sources must emit strongly at millimeter wavelengths ( @xmath6 jy ) .",
    "we initially observed the complete @xcite sample at 0.9 @xmath0 m with keck / lris ( see  [ sec : lris ] and appendix [ sec : app_lris ] ) , and chose only objects that satisfy our selection criteria for high angular resolution millimeter observations (  [ sec : ovro ] ) and detailed modeling .",
    "our sample includes iras 04016 + 2610 , iras 04108 + 2803b , iras 04239 + 2436 , iras 04295 + 2251 , and iras 04381 + 2540 .",
    "general properties of our sample are discussed here , and information about individual objects is given below in  [ sec : results2 ] .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of our sample span 0.4 to 3.7 l@xmath3 , similar to the distribution of luminosities for the complete sample of @xcite , which has a median luminosity of 0.7 l@xmath3 .",
    "the seds for our sample objects are similar in shape , exhibiting high extinction of the central objects , small amounts of mid - ir absorption , and peaks near 100 @xmath0 m . while these sed characteristics are common to most other sources in the @xcite sample , several of the seds for their sample exhibit deep 10 @xmath0 m absorption features .",
    "as discussed below , the depth of the 10 @xmath0 m feature is correlated with source viewing angle ; the dearth of objects with deep 10 @xmath0 m absorption in our sample may therefore indicate selection against edge - on sources .",
    "there are other clear selection effects for our sample , since we are biased toward sources exhibiting bright scattered light and millimeter continuum emission .",
    "for example , by selecting sources exhibiting bright scattered light nebulae , we are selecting against face - on sources where the directly visible , point - like protostar would dominate the short - wavelength emission , as well as objects with extremely high line - of - sight extinctions , such as one might expect for massive spherical envelopes .",
    "since edge - on sources produce dimmer scattered nebulosity , these may also be under - represented in our sample .",
    "finally , our selection criteria for bright millimeter emission favors objects with higher masses of dust concentrated in smaller volumes .",
    "future observations of larger samples with more sensitive instruments are necessary to investigate these potential biases .",
    "we imaged each source in our sample at both 1.3 mm ( 230 ghz ) and 3 mm ( 115 ghz ) with the ovro millimeter array between 2002 august and december .",
    "the 3 mm observations were conducted in the `` compact '' array configuration , which provides baselines between 20 and 55 m , while the 1.3 mm observations were obtained mostly with the `` equatorial '' configuration , providing baselines from 30 to 120 m. for iras 04295 + 2251 and iras 04381 + 2540 , 1.3 mm data were also obtained with the `` high '' configuration , which provides baselines from 35 to 240 m. continuum data were recorded in four 1-ghz channels .",
    "we calibrated the amplitudes and phases of the data using quasars near on the sky ( @xmath7 ) to our target sources .",
    "the flux of our target sources was calibrated using observations of neptune and uranus , which have known millimeter fluxes , to calibrate the response of the instrument .",
    "all data calibrations were performed using the ovro software package mma @xcite . using the calibrated data for each source , we inverted the interferometric visibilities to create an image , and de - convolved and cleaned the images using the miriad package @xcite .",
    "we averaged the data using robust weighting ( with a robustness parameter of 0.5 ) to obtain a good balance between sensitivity and angular resolution .    from our data , we measured photometric fluxes for our targets at both 3 mm and 1 mm wavelengths .",
    "the emission is much stronger at 1 mm , as expected for thermally - emitting dust , and thus the sources are more clearly detected at the shorter wavelength .",
    "in addition , since the angular resolution is inversely proportional to the observing wavelength , and because we obtained longer - baseline data at 1 mm than at 3 mm , our 1 mm images have better angular resolution .",
    "our 1 mm images , shown in figure [ fig : mm ] , have angular resolution of @xmath8 , and rms sensitivity of @xmath9 mjy / beam .",
    "the measured fluxes , listed in table [ tab : seds ] , are integrated over the ovro beam , which is @xmath8 at 1 mm , and @xmath10 at 3 mm .",
    "we obtained images of our class i sample at 0.9 @xmath0 m ( cousins @xmath11-band ) using the w.m .",
    "keck ii telescope and the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in imaging mode .",
    "the observations were conducted on 1998 october 30 - 31 and 1999 december 13 .",
    "the integration time was 300 seconds , the seeing was @xmath12 , the field of view was @xmath13 , and the plate scale was 0.21 arcseconds per pixel .",
    "image processing included bias subtraction and flat fielding .",
    "the photometric fluxes of the target sources , integrated over a @xmath14 ( 30 pixels ) diameter aperture with background measured over an annulus extending from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ( 125 - 145 pixels ) , were calibrated using equatorial standards from @xcite , assuming typical extinction coefficients for mauna kea ( 0.07 mag / airmass at @xmath11 band ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; all sources were observed at an airmass of less than 1.1 .",
    "all objects in our sample were detected at 0.9 @xmath0 m , and show varying amounts of extended emission arising from scattered light due to dust - obscured central sources .",
    "our images are shown in figure [ fig : iband ] .",
    "we determined absolute astrometry for these images by finding reference sources in common to our images and the 2mass survey and computing a six coefficient fit for the image coordinates , plate scale , and distortion .",
    "the astrometry is accurate to @xmath17 , including the uncertainty in our astrometric solution and the overall uncertainty from 2mass .",
    "because we determine accurate positions for our @xmath11-band images , we can register the scattered light emission with the millimeter - wavelength emission observed with ovro (  [ sec : ovro ] ) .",
    "since the longer wavelength radiation is optically thin , it traces dust mass and is therefore likely to be centered on the central source . in figure",
    "[ fig : iband ] , we have indicated the centroid of the millimeter continuum emission ( and thus the likely position of the central protostar ) with a cross . as we discuss below",
    ", the offset of the scattered light emission with respect to the central protostar provides valuable insights into source geometry and viewing angle .",
    "our sources were also observed at 10.3 and 17.9 @xmath0 m with the keck long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ; * ? ? ? * ) between 1999 august and 2000 december .",
    "lws allows diffraction - limited ( fwhm=@xmath18 ) imaging over a @xmath19 field of view , although the observations described here were obtained under poor seeing conditions , fwhm=@xmath20 . with this seeing - limited resolution ,",
    "none of our targets are angularly resolved at @xmath21 @xmath0 m .",
    "photometric fluxes were measured in a @xmath22 ( 24 pixels ) diameter aperture , with subtraction of the sky background measured in an annulus spanning @xmath23-@xmath24 ( 50 - 80 pixels ) .",
    "flat - fielding did not improve the data quality , and was therefore not applied before measuring photometry .",
    "standard stars were observed each night to obtain atmospheric extinction curves , and curve - of - growth corrections were applied to each star to convert measured aperture photometry to infinite - aperture values .",
    "in addition , these keck / lws observations provided 8 - 13 @xmath0 m spectra , which have been reduced and analyzed by @xcite .",
    "seds were constructed using photometric fluxes from the literature and new measurements at 0.9 @xmath0 m (  [ sec : lris ] ) , 18 @xmath0 m (  [ sec : lws ] ) , 1.3 mm , and 3 mm (  [ sec : ovro ] ) .",
    "uncertainties are not available for much of the photometry from the literature , and therefore we adopt estimated , uniform photometric uncertainties in the modeling described below (  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "since these uniform error bars lead to the over - weighting of higher fluxes , we consider the logarithms of the seds in our modeling .",
    "the fluxes used in our analysis , converted into units of jy , are listed in table [ tab : seds ] and plotted along with best - fit models below in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we use the three dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code mc3d @xcite to model simultaneously the seds , 0.9 @xmath0 m scattered light images , and millimeter continuum images of our sample of class i sources ( mc3d has been validated by benchmark comparison to other monte carlo and grid - based radiative transfer codes ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the basic model is that of a central emission source surrounded by obscuring dust of arbitrary geometry .",
    "the mc3d code solves the radiative transfer equation and determines the temperature distribution of circumstellar dust self - consistently .",
    "moreover , the code takes into account absorption and multiple scattering events .",
    "the main inputs for this modeling are 1 ) parameters of the central star , 2 ) properties of dust grains , and 3 ) geometry of circumstellar dust .",
    "we now describe which properties in these categories are varied in our modeling , as well as our assumptions for other parameters . since our concern is primarily with understanding the geometry , we fix most of the stellar and dust parameters . for the models described below , we assume that the central object resembles a typical class ii t tauri star .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath25 k , @xmath26 r@xmath3 , and @xmath27 m@xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although few direct constraints exist on these parameters , spectroscopy of iras 04016 + 2610 has yielded an estimated effective temperature between @xmath28 k and a radius of @xmath29 r@xmath3 @xcite , reasonably consistent with our assumptions .",
    "the dynamically - estimated stellar mass of iras 04381 + 2540 is @xmath30 m@xmath3 @xcite , also compatible with our assumptions .",
    "accretion onto the stellar surface may generate substantial luminosity in shocks near the stellar surface , which would supplement the stellar luminosity @xcite : @xmath31 . in our modeling",
    ", we initially assume that @xmath32 , but we include a scale factor to allow for additional accretion luminosity ( and/or slightly different stellar parameters from those assumed ) . as the last step in our modeling procedure , we find the value of @xmath33 for which no scale factor is required .",
    "although the spectral shape of emission from the accretion shock may differ from the stellar emission , we ignore this effect and assume that the temperature of all emission is 4000 k ; the spectral shape is not critical given the extremely high optical depths in the inner regions of our models . in summary ,",
    "all stellar parameters are constant from model to model , with the exception of a luminosity scaling that represents @xmath34 .",
    "we assume that the dust grains are spherical with a power - law size distribution @xmath35 @xcite , where @xmath36 @xmath0 m and @xmath37 @xmath0 m , appropriate for ism - like grains .",
    "we further assume that the dust is composed of a standard ism mixture of 62.5% silicate and 25% ortho + 12.5% para graphite ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with optical properties from @xcite .",
    "previous authors have explored the effects of varying the chemical composition and particle size distribution of the circumstellar dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these parameters affect the overall sed , and 10 and 18 @xmath0 m silicate features , to some extent . for simplicity ,",
    "we keep the dust composition and particle size distribution fixed in our modeling .",
    "the main remaining input for radiative transfer is the density distribution , and we focus our efforts on exploring the parameter space associated with circumstellar geometry .",
    "we consider three classes of models : rotating infalling envelopes , flared disks , and envelopes+disks .",
    "each of these models is defined from an inner radius , @xmath38 , to an outer radius , @xmath39 .",
    "the inner radius is assumed to be 0.1 au ( comparable to the dust sublimation radius ) , although this parameter is not crucial to the modeling given the high optical depths near to the central protostar .",
    "however , @xmath39 may have substantial effects on models for the circumstellar material , and thus we allow this parameter to vary in our modeling .    for each of the models considered in the following sections , several important parameters influence the density distributions , with concomitant effects on observed images and seds . in order to explore the effects of these parameters",
    ", we generate small grids of models by varying several important properties .",
    "large grids are not possible due to the long run - time of monte carlo radiative transfer codes ( typically several hours per model ) , and we therefore consider only three values for each parameter .",
    "for the pure envelope model (  [ sec : env ] ) , we vary the mass infall rate , @xmath40 , the centrifugal radius , @xmath41 , the outer radius , @xmath39 , and the inclination , @xmath42 .",
    "the values of @xmath40 are chosen to provide total envelope masses of @xmath43 and @xmath44 m@xmath3 ; since the envelope mass depends to some extent on parameters other than @xmath40 ( see equation [ eq : env ] and  [ sec : env ] ) , the accretion rates explored include 27 discrete values between @xmath45 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4",
    ". sampled values of the other parameters are @xmath46 , and @xmath47 au ; @xmath48 , and @xmath49 au ; and @xmath50 in increments of @xmath51 . for the pure disk model , we vary the disk mass , scale height , outer radius , and inclination ; @xmath52 and @xmath53 m@xmath3 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 au , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 au , and @xmath50 in increments of @xmath51 . finally , for the envelope+disk model , we assume @xmath56 au , but allow @xmath57 to vary , in addition to varying several important envelope parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath39 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the range of envelope parameters are the same as for the pure envelope model , and we sample @xmath58 , and 1.0 m@xmath3 .",
    "all of the parameter values in these grids are chosen to bracket physically - plausible values .    in order to compare with our observations",
    ", we use mc3d to compute self - consistently the temperature distribution , the sed from 0.1 - 5000 @xmath0 m , the scattered light image at 0.9 @xmath0 m , and the dust continuum image at 1.3 mm , for each model .",
    "the best - fit models are determined by minimizing the residuals between model and data for the combined sed+imaging dataset . specifically , we minimize the quantity @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the reduced @xmath61 value of a model fitted only to the sed data , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the analogous quantities for the @xmath11-band and 1 mm images .",
    "thus , @xmath64 gives equal weight to the three datasets ( as opposed to a true @xmath65 for the combined sed+imaging dataset , which would give more weight to the greater number of imaging datapoints relative to sed measurements ) .",
    "to calculate @xmath65 values for each dataset , we estimate the uncertainties by assuming that the best - fit model ( amongst all classes of models considered ) for a given dataset has a reduced @xmath61 value of unity , and setting the error bars accordingly .",
    "this means that when a model is fitted to a given dataset ( e.g. , seds ) , the reduced @xmath61 is given by the sum of the squared residuals divided by the minimum value of this quantity for all of the models considered : denoting summed squared residuals by @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "thus , equation [ eq : x2_norm1 ] can be re - written as @xmath68 as mentioned above , when fitting the sed we minimize the difference between the logarithms of the model and data , to emphasize the shape of the sed over the peak value .",
    "in addition , we allow a scale factor between the model sed and the observed fluxes . when fitting 0.9 @xmath0 m and 1 mm images , we first rotate the observed images to a position angle where the brightest scattered light is south of the millimeter emission , consistent with the position angle definition in our models .",
    "once the best - fit model out of these grids has been determined , we attempt to `` zoom in '' on the solution with more finely gridded values of inclination . during this zoom - in stage",
    ", we also vary @xmath33 to produce the correct normalization between the modeled and observed seds ( without a scale factor ) . because the central luminosity is somewhat degenerate with the total optical depth of the system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , minor adjustments to @xmath40 and/or @xmath57 may be required when @xmath33 is varied . thus , when zooming in on a solution , we vary @xmath42 , @xmath33 , and @xmath40 and/or @xmath57 simultaneously .",
    "the effects of various parameters on the seds have already been explored by previous investigators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and some work has studied the effects on scattered light images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we attempt to improve on this previous work by illustrating the effects of model parameters on our combined sed+imaging dataset for a broad range of circumstellar geometries , and discussing how degeneracies between fitted parameters can be broken . in the remainder of this section , we describe the rotating infalling envelope , flared disk , and disk+envelope geometries . in the following section",
    ", we present the best - fit model from each category for comparison to our observations .      the density distribution for a rotating , infalling envelope is given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we analytically solve for @xmath74 : @xmath76 this is a cubic equation with three solutions .",
    "the correct solution is the one for which @xmath77 has the same sign as @xmath78 , and for which the solution is real . in other words , a particle that starts in the northern or southern hemisphere",
    "never leaves that hemisphere .",
    "the analytic solution is thus @xmath79 where @xmath80 is defined as @xmath81 we include an outflow cavity in our envelope models by decreasing the density by some factor , @xmath82 , in the polar regions of the circumstellar distributions .",
    "the cavity shape is defined by @xmath83 here , @xmath84 is the height above the midplane , @xmath85 describes how close to the star the outflow cavity begins , and @xmath86 describes the opening angle and shape of the outflow .",
    "we fix @xmath87 au , since this parameter does not have major affects on the observed seds or scattered light images .",
    "we also assume that within the outflow cavity , the density decreases by a factor of @xmath88 relative to the rest of the envelope ; this value of @xmath82 produces the correct amount of extinction to match the observed short - wavelength seds .",
    "the cavity profile has some effect on the structure of modeled scattered light emission .",
    "however , these effects are small compared with the other envelope properties ; thus , we fix the value of @xmath86 at 1.1 in our analysis . using other types of cavities ( e.g. , cones ) may have small effects on the scattered light images , but will have negligible effects on seds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we fit this envelope model to our data by varying @xmath40 , @xmath41 , the outer radius of the envelope , @xmath39 , and the viewing angle of the model , @xmath42 .",
    "some of these parameters produce degenerate effects on the models , which is why we generate grids where these parameters are varied simultaneously .",
    "however , we address the effects of each parameter below in order to shed light on how our different datasets constrain various envelope properties .",
    "the accretion rate , @xmath40 , is one of the most important parameters in terms of its effects on the sed , since it is linked to the total envelope mass ( equation [ eq : env ] ) , and thus governs directly the optical depth of the dust surrounding the protostar ( figure [ fig : env_mdot ] ) . for higher mass accretion rates , the optical depth will increase , and less of the short - wavelength emission will escape ( either directly or as scattered light ) .",
    "moreover , the mid - ir absorption deepens , because of increased extinction of the stellar emission and absorption in the 10 and 18 @xmath0 m silicate features .",
    "the short - wavelength radiation is re - processed and emitted at longer wavelengths , leading to more emission at far - ir through millimeter wavelengths for higher values of @xmath40 .",
    "the higher optical depths associated with large mass accretion rates also push the visible scattering surfaces outward , leading to somewhat larger @xmath11-band images .",
    "however , for very large accretion rates , the near - ir emission may be quenched altogether ( figure [ fig : env_mdot ] ) .",
    "the centrifugal radius , @xmath41 , defines the radius in the model where material falling in from outer regions joins rotationally - supported material in the inner region . outside of @xmath41 ,",
    "the envelope is essentially spherical ( except for the outflow cavity ) , while the density distribution is significantly flattened interior to the centrifugal radius .",
    "in addition , matter builds up at @xmath41 , leading to a region of enhanced density . for smaller values of @xmath41 , a larger fraction of the envelope material",
    "is spherically distributed , and the optical depth is larger for most sight - lines .",
    "thus , models with small @xmath41 show large near - ir extinctions and deep mid - ir absorption ( largely degenerate with the effects of @xmath40 ; figures [ fig : env_mdot ] and [ fig : env_rc ] ) . in contrast , for larger @xmath41 , more of the envelope s mass is relegated to the midplane , making it easier for emission to escape .",
    "thus , scattered emission is stronger for larger values of @xmath41 .",
    "this parameter also has a critical effect on the modeled millimeter images : since the density is higher for radii @xmath89 , the size of the millimeter emission will correlate with the centrifugal radius ( figure [ fig : env_rc ] ) .",
    "thus , the sizes of our millimeter images constrain @xmath41 directly .",
    "the outer radius also affects the model , mainly by changing the optical depth ; larger values of @xmath39 lead to more mass in the envelope , and thus more extinction of short wavelength light and more emission of long - wavelength radiation ( figure [ fig : env_rout ] ) .",
    "smaller values of @xmath39 may require larger values of @xmath40 and/or smaller values of @xmath41 in order to correctly model the sed .",
    "@xmath39 is constrained strongly from our scattered light and millimeter images , since larger outer radii produce larger images ( figure [ fig : env_rout ] ) . for our sample , the observed sizes of scattered light constrain @xmath39 to be @xmath90 au , while the fact that the millimeter images are fairly compact rules out outer radii larger than @xmath91 au .",
    "inclination is a crucial parameter for modeling both the sed and the scattered light images . as noted by previous authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and shown in figure [ fig : env_inc ] , the sed changes drastically depending on viewing angle . at larger inclinations , where the observer s line of sight passes through more of the dense midplane , the overall optical depth of the model increases , leading to enhanced extinction at short wavelengths and absorption at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "in contrast , for smaller inclinations the optical depth is lower , and for face - on models , the line of sight may go directly down the outflow cavity to the central protostar .",
    "in addition to affecting the amount of scattering or direct stellar radiation , the inclination also affects the shape of the scattered emission : for edge - on distributions , the scattered light arises mainly from the edges of the outflow cavity , producing a symmetric structure with two lobes . as the inclination decreases , one lobe brightens with respect to the other , and moves closer to the central protostar as the line of sight pierces further into the cavity .",
    "finally , for inclinations close to face - on , the protostar is visible directly , swamping any scattered emission that might be present .",
    "since our millimeter images are only marginally spatially resolved , inclination is not important in modeling this emission .",

    "we assume fixed values for the exponents of radial and vertical density distributions , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively . for a flared disk in hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "one expects @xmath98 @xcite , and we adopt this value . using the relation that results from viscous accretion theory , @xmath99 @xcite , we obtain @xmath100 .",

    "the disk mass affects our modeled seds , scattered light images , and millimeter images .",
    "regarding the seds , higher dust mass increases the optical depth , leading to higher obscuration of the central star , deeper 10 and 18 @xmath0 m silicate absorption , and enhanced re - emission at long wavelengths . as illustrated by figure [ fig : disk_mass ] , the disk mass also has substantial effects on the scattered light : for sufficiently small disk masses ( @xmath103 m@xmath3 ) the central protostar is visible for inclination @xmath104 and this stellar radiation swamps any scattered light .",
    "however , for higher disk masses , the flared disk surface becomes sufficiently optically - thick to obscure the protostar , allowing scattered emission to be observed .",
    "the morphologies of millimeter images are only slightly affected by disk mass : more massive disks have millimeter emission detectable out to larger radii , leading to slightly larger observed images .",
    "the effects of @xmath102 are similar to the effects of @xmath57 in some respects ; however , sed+imaging data allows us to disentangle the two .",
    "larger values of @xmath102 produce more absorption at short wavelengths , and if the scale height becomes large enough to obscure the central protostar , scattered emission becomes visible ( figure [ fig : disk_h0 ] ) .",
    "these effects are similar to those produced by higher values of disk mass .",
    "however , the effects on the longer - wavelength emission differ ; higher values of @xmath102 increase the far - ir flux , but have little effect on fluxes or image morphologies at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "changing @xmath39 does not significantly affect the seds , as long as the disk mass is held fixed ( figure [ fig : disk_rout ] ) .",
    "this is because the optical depth of the model is not affected substantially by @xmath39 .",
    "however , there are small changes due to the larger surface area of optically - thick dust for larger values of @xmath39 . in addition",
    ", larger outer radii produce larger images in both scattered light and millimeter emission , since disk material is distributed to larger radii .",
    "disk viewing angle is a crucial property in modeling the seds and scattered light images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar to the dependence of envelope model seds on inclination , more edge - on disk models exhibit deeper absorption at mid - ir wavelengths , and higher extinction of the central star ( figure [ fig : disk_inc ] ) .",
    "inclination also substantially affects the observed scattered light : for moderate inclinations ( @xmath105 ) , the central star is visible and dominates the @xmath11-band emission , while for larger inclinations the protostar is obscured and an asymmetric scattered light structure is observed . for nearly edge - on orientations , a symmetric , structure is observed , corresponding to the top and bottom surfaces of the flared disk . as for envelope models , our marginally resolved millimeter images can not constrain well the inclination , although the offset between scattered light and millimeter emission does probe the orientation of disk models .",
    "in addition to pure envelopes and pure disks , we consider a model incorporating both an envelope and an embedded disk .",
    "the main difference between this model and the pure envelope model is an enhanced density in the midplane , especially interior to the centrifugal radius . as a result of this enhanced midplane density ,",
    "more long - wavelength emission is produced than for a pure envelope model .",
    "since the amount of long - wavelength emission for a pure envelope model depends primarily on the mass infall rate , @xmath40 , additional long - wavelength emission from the disk component may allow good fits to the data with lower inferred values of @xmath40 .",
    "the effect of the disk component on the sed is illustrated in figure [ fig : sed_disk_env ] .",
    "in addition to larger fluxes , inclusion of a disk component also leads to more centrally concentrated modeled scattered light and millimeter images . with our marginally resolved millimeter images , we can not probe such density concentrations directly .",
    "however , as we discuss further below , comparison of our interferometrically measured fluxes , which trace compact emission , with lower - resolution measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can provide some constraint on the relative amounts of compact and large - scale material , providing an additional test of how well these models fit the data .    the envelope+disk model is implemented by computing the density distributions for both a disk and an envelope , and then setting the density of the combined model to be the greater of the two individual densities for a given position , @xmath106 .",
    "the temperature distribution , spectral energy distribution , and images are then calculated self - consistently for the combined model using mc3d . in our current implementation of the disk+envelope density distribution",
    ", the outer radius of the disk can not be specified independently of the outer radius of the envelope .",
    "thus , our models may not truly represent a physical disk+envelope model , where one might expect the disk component to end at @xmath72 .",
    "these models should therefore be regarded as only qualitative indicators that both disk and envelope components are needed to match the data .",
    "finally , we consider another variation of a disk+envelope model , incorporating a flared disk density distribution plus foreground extinction .",
    "the extinction in this model mimics the obscuring nature of the envelope in the disk+envelope model described in  [ sec : d+e ] , but employs a simpler geometry . in the following sections , we refer to this variation as a disk+extinction model .",
    "we consider values of @xmath107 ranging from 0 to 60 mag , which allows foreground extinctions much higher than expected from ambient material in the taurus region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "extinctions higher than possible from ambient cloud material ( @xmath108 ) probably arise in material associated with the collapsing cloud cores surrounding the sources .",
    "sub - millimeter fluxes observed in large - beam scuba maps @xcite can be used to estimate column densities , and thus extinctions toward our sample of class i objects .",
    "since higher extinctions are inferred for more compact dust distributions , models requiring larger values of @xmath107 imply smaller dust structures .",
    "based on the scuba fluxes @xcite , extinctions larger than @xmath109 mag are only possible if the material is distributed primarily on scales smaller than @xmath110 au , on the order of expected envelope sizes .    in this disk+extinction model ,",
    "the morphologies of scattered light and millimeter continuum images are unaffected by the uniformly - distributed obscuring envelope material , and thus the model images resemble those predicted by pure disk models . since the dependence of the modeled images on various disk parameters is the same as for pure disk models (  [ sec : disk ] ) , we refer to figures [ fig : disk_mass][fig : disk_inc ] .",
    "however , the foreground extinction substantially alters the synthetic seds by eliminating much of the short - wavelength stellar flux observed for pure disks .",
    "this model thus provides a way to produce disk - like images at the same time as heavily reddened seds .",
    "for each of the density distributions described in  [ sec : model ] , we determine the model providing the best - fit to our combined sed+imaging dataset .",
    "the properties of the best - fit models , as well as the reduced @xmath61 residuals between models and data , are listed in table [ tab : bestfits ] , and the models are plotted in figures [ fig : i04016][fig : i04381 ] .",
    "our results clearly indicate that pure disk models are not applicable for our sample of class i sources . rather , the data suggest models incorporating a massive envelope with an outflow cavity , although most sources are fitted best by models including _ both _ envelopes _ and _ disks . in this section",
    ", we discuss general results of our sed and image fitting , then describe results for individual sources in detail in  [ sec : results2 ] .",
    "while the observed seds for our sample show fairly shallow absorption at mid - ir wavelengths ( figures [ fig : i04016][fig : i04381 ] ) , edge - on disk models produce deep mid - ir absorption ( figure [ fig : disk_inc ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in addition , our asymmetric scattered light images rule out disk models close to edge - on , since such models would produce symmetric structures ( figure [ fig : disk_inc ] ) .",
    "however , the extended scattered light images indicate that disk models viewed close to face - on are not applicable either , since such models would be dominated by emission from the point - like central protostar . since we observe spatially resolved , asymmetric scattered light toward our sample objects , we know that we are not directly observing the star , as would be the case for face - on or moderately inclined disk models .",
    "although there may be a narrow range of inclinations for which pure disk models can fit both the seds and scattered light images of some of our sources , substantial foreground extinction ( @xmath111 mag ) is needed to make such a model consistent with the small optical / near - ir fluxes for our sample .",
    "as indicated by table [ tab : bestfits ] and figures [ fig : i04016][fig : i04381 ] , disk+extinction models provide far superior fits than pure disk models with @xmath112 .",
    "however , the extinction values for the best - fit disk+extinction models are all much larger than expected from ambient material in the taurus cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating a large concentration of mass on small scales toward these class i sources .",
    "thus , the disk+extinction models imply the existence of massive envelopes in addition to disk components .",
    "pure envelope models also fail to fit the data well for most targets in our sample ( table [ tab : bestfits ] ) . as illustrated in figures [ fig : i04016][fig : i04381 ] , pure envelope models typically over - predict the peak flux in the sed . as discussed further below",
    ", pure envelopes also predict more extended millimeter emission than actually observed . thus",
    ", pure envelope density distributions also do not seem suitable for explaining most features of the data for our sample .    for most , if not all , of the objects in our sample , the best fitting models ( i.e. , those for which the residuals between model and data are minimized ) incorporate both an envelope and a disk ( described either by disk+envelope or disk+extinction models ; table [ tab : bestfits ] ) . however , while seds and 1 mm images are fitted best by disk+envelope models , the scattered light images for some sources seem to favor pure disk or pure envelope models .",
    "this may suggest that our disk+envelope model is too simplistic , and that a more complex implementation of disk+envelope models would allow all of the data to be fitted simultaneously .",
    "alternately , the dust grain size distribution or composition may differ from our standard assumptions or vary radially or vertically within the model density distributions .",
    "one piece of evidence in support of the former hypothesis is the fact that the best - fit pure disk or envelope models , which usually fit the scattered light images well , generally have larger values of @xmath39 than the best - fit disk+envelope models ( table [ tab : bestfits ] ) .",
    "this suggests a flattened distribution of small dust grains that extends beyond the outer radius of our best - fit disk+envelope models .",
    "we discuss this issue further in ",
    "[ sec : geometry ] .",
    "one way to test the relative contributions of disks and envelopes is to compare the compact millimeter emission observed in our ovro observations with more extended emission seen in lower - resolution single - dish observations @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in the case of iras 04016 + 2610 in figure [ fig : radprof ] , pure disks , pure envelopes , and disks+envelopes produce varying amounts of compact and extended emission , and thus comparison of high- and low - resolution millimeter data can help to distinguish between models . as described in  [ sec : results2 ] , our interferometric fluxes typically ( with one exception ) differ by @xmath113 from the single - dish measurements of @xcite ( table [ tab : compact ] ) , indicating that the sources we are observing produce most of their emission from compact inner regions .",
    "thus , disks appear to be an important , if not dominant , component of the circumstellar distributions around our sample of class i objects .",
    "combined with the arguments presented above , this provides further evidence that the circumstellar material resides in some combination of disks and envelopes .",
    "iras 04016 + 2610 is an iras source @xcite lying at the western edge of the l1489 dark cloud @xcite , and driving a molecular outflow @xcite .",

    "this is substantially larger than the stellar luminosity inferred from near - ir spectroscopy @xcite , and suggests a large accretion luminosity .",
    "since the total accretion rate determined from our fitting of disk+envelope models is not substantially higher than for other sources , we suggest that this additional luminosity may be generated in a more active accretion shock near the protostellar surface .    for iras 04016 + 2610 ,",
    "the flux measured in our @xmath8 beam is approximately 40% of the value measured by @xcite in an @xmath124 beam .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the ratios predicted by our best - fit models , and may indicate that there is additional compact emission that we have not accounted for in the models .",
    "for example , if the disk is confined to radii smaller than @xmath41 , as opposed to @xmath39 as assumed in our models , more mass would be concentrated at smaller radii .",
    "finally , we note that although the pure envelope model appears to fit our combined imaging+sed dataset almost as well as the disk+envelope model ( table [ tab : bestfits ] ) , the ratio of compact to extended emission for the pure envelope model is much smaller than observed , providing further support for the disk+envelope model .",

    "the large polarizations observed toward class i sources in near - ir polarimetric imaging observations support the notion of extended distributions of small dust grains @xcite . at the edges of near - ir scattered light nebulosity observed for our sample , where most of the light is single - scattered at approximately 90@xmath174 , linear polarizations are 70 - 80% @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the maximum polarizations predicted by our disk+envelope @xmath11-band model images are @xmath175 .",
    "moreover , the integrated polarizations in our model images are substantially lower than the integrated near - ir polarizations measured by @xcite , re - enforcing our hypothesis that there may be a population of small grains at large radii not included in our models .",
    "since our best - fit models indicate that class i sources are probably surrounded by envelopes with outflow cavities ( in addition to disks ) , we expect observed outflows from these objects to lie in the middle of these cavities . for iras 04016 + 2610 , iras 04239 + 2436 , and iras 04381 + 2540",
    ", outflows have been observed at position angles of 165@xmath174 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 , respectively @xcite .",
    "comparison of these position angles with figure [ fig : iband ] demonstrates that the outflows lie in the middle of the observed scattered light structures . for iras 04295 + 2251 and iras 04108 + 2803b",
    ", no geometrical information about molecular outflows is available .",
    "thus , in all cases where outflow geometries can be derived , they are consistent with expectations from our modeling .",
    "the range of inclinations for best - fit models is small , with a spread of @xmath7 across all sources for a given model .",
    "this may be explained to some extent by selection effects : bright scattered light can only be observed if targets are inclined sufficiently to block the light from the central star .",
    "moreover , scattered light is somewhat brighter for moderate than for edge - on inclinations , which may bias our sample against edge - on sources as well .",
    "nevertheless , the tight clustering of inclinations ( table [ tab : bestfits ] ) may be due in some part to limitations of our models in accurately representing the true density distributions .",
    "for example , for the disk+envelope model the assumed disk density profile may favor small inclinations for which the observer s line of sight passes through the flared surface of the disk rather than the dense midplane , while inclinations @xmath178 , for which the line of sight does not pierce directly down the outflow cavity , are required to reproduce the extended scattered light structures and heavily reddened seds .",
    "observations of larger samples and refinements to the models are necessary to provide a more reliable estimate of the inclination distribution of class i sources .      as seen in table [ tab : bestfits ] , the masses of best - fit disk models , and the masses of the disk components of disk+envelope models , span a range of values from @xmath179 to 1.0 m@xmath3 .",
    "these high disk masses result naturally from the high optical depths of these models ( @xmath180 at 100 @xmath0 m , and @xmath181 even at 1 mm ) . for pure disk models ,",
    "large masses are required to extinct the central star ( thus allowing scattered light to be observed ) and to produce the observed millimeter emission ( figure [ fig : disk_mass ] ) . moreover , the high optical depths that result from large disk masses lead to large amounts of cold dust in the midplane , which emits most of its radiation at millimeter wavelengths . for disk+envelope models ,",
    "large disk masses enable enhanced millimeter emission without substantially altering the peak flux at shorter wavelengths . moreover ,",
    "substantial disk components lead to more centrally - concentrated millimeter emission , consistent with observations ( figure [ fig : radprof ] ; table [ tab : compact ] ) .",
    "disk masses larger than @xmath182 m@xmath3 may be unphysical , since they are gravitationally unstable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , when the mass of a rotating disk is larger than approximately @xmath183 ( where @xmath184 is the disk aspect ratio ) , the disk becomes gravitationally unstable and rapidly transfers angular momentum outward , resulting in rapid accretion of material onto the central protostar .",
    "this accretion process occurs on the order of the outer disk dynamical timescale ( @xmath185 yr ) , and is thus very fast compared to the inferred infall rate and should rapidly bring the disk mass down to a stable level . for our best - fit disk models , @xmath186 , and for a 0.5 m@xmath3 star the stability criterion requires @xmath187 m@xmath3 . while numerical simulations suggest that disks may remain stable with slightly higher masses , @xmath188 m@xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our models still require disk masses far in excess of this value .",
    "one implication of these un - physically - large disk masses is that rotating disk models seem untenable for modeling the imaging and sed data for class i sources .",
    "our massive , best - fit disk models may therefore resemble the magnetically - supported `` pseudo - disks '' proposed to occur during the early stages of protostellar collapse @xcite .",
    "thus , while disk+extinction models provide good fits to the data for some sources (  [ sec : results ] ; table [ tab : bestfits ] ) , the large disks implied by these models may not correspond to the keplerian disks seen at later evolutionary stages .",
    "these large disk masses are also a concern for the best - fit disk+envelope models , where disk components are necessary to fit the seds well ( figures [ fig : i04016]-[fig : i04381 ] ) , and to provide the correct ratios of compact to extended millimeter emission ( table [ tab : compact ] ) .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : radprof ] , the most important contribution of the disk component occurs within the envelope s centrifugal radius , while outside of @xmath41 , the millimeter emission from a disk+envelope model has a similar profile to the emission from a pure envelope . if the disk component is truncated at @xmath41 ( as opposed to @xmath39 , as implemented in our radiative transfer code )",
    ", the disk mass can be decreased by a factor of @xmath109 , while the compact disk emission within @xmath41 will still produce ratios of compact to extended millimeter emission consistent with observations . in order to produce the correct total millimeter flux ,",
    "the envelope mass must be increased to compensate for the loss of emission from larger disk radii .",
    "as indicated by figure [ fig : radprof ] , these outer disk regions contribute approximately 50% of the millimeter flux at radii @xmath189 . by truncating the disk component of disk+envelope models at @xmath41 , the disk masses listed in table [ tab : bestfits ]",
    "may be decreased by a factor of @xmath109 , while the envelope masses may increase by factors of @xmath190 .",
    "thus , true masses of the disk components for disk+envelope models may be @xmath191 m@xmath3 , close to the limit of gravitational stability and therefore more physically plausible than the values listed in table [ tab : bestfits ] .    even for disks truncated at @xmath41 ,",
    "the disk masses are often larger than the masses of the envelope components of disk+envelope models .",
    "envelope masses range from @xmath192 to 0.05 m@xmath3 , and sources with smaller envelope masses tend to have relatively large disk masses , suggesting that different objects in our sample may be more or less disk - dominated .",
    "however , large - scale emission from extended material belies this trend to some extent : for example , while iras 04381 + 2540 appears to be the most disk - dominated source in our sample based on estimated disk and envelope masses , table [ tab : compact ] indicates that there is probably a substantial extended dust component as well .",
    "thus , it is hard to draw conclusions about the relative evolutionary stages of different objects in our sample based on inferred disk and envelope masses .",
    "an issue closely related to the properties of circumstellar material in class i sources is their evolutionary stage . while flared disk models",
    "are consistent with the seds of class ii objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have shown that such models are not suitable for the class i objects in our sample .",
    "indeed , we have found that models incorporating both envelopes and disks provide a better match to the data .",
    "this finding would seem to support the standard assumption that class i sources are more embedded , still surrounded by massive envelopes , and potentially younger than class ii sources . on the other hand , spherically symmetric models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not compatible with our data , indicating that class i sources are at a stage intermediate to cloud cores and star+disk systems .",
    "however , other investigators have suggested that class i and ii sources actually may be at similar evolutionary stages .",
    "one piece of evidence in support of this hypothesis is that the spectroscopically - determined stellar ages of class i and ii sources appear indistinguishable @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that differences in observed circumstellar properties between the two classes are caused by different viewing angles , rather than different amounts or geometry of circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "however , our results show that the five class i objects in our sample are viewed at moderate inclinations ( @xmath193 ) , refuting earlier suggestions that optically - visible class i objects are predominantly viewed edge - on , and arguing that the circumstellar material around class is is indeed less evolved than that around class iis .",
    "another argument supporting similar evolutionary states of class i and ii objects is the fact that measured accretion rates , pertaining to the transfer of material from the inner disk onto the central star , appear similar for the two classes @xcite . in contrast , the new data and modeling presented in this paper confirm earlier estimates of mass infall rates from the envelope onto the disk orders of magnitude higher than the derived inner disk accretion rates . the fact that disk and envelope accretion rates are not the same suggests periodic `` fu - ori '' episodes where the accretion rate temporarily increases by more than an order of magnitude , likely due to a gravitational instability in the accretion disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the episodic accretion scenario would imply more massive disks in class i sources relative to class ii objects . while class i objects appear to be surrounded by larger total masses of dust , the emission on scales smaller than @xmath194 indicates similar masses in the compact disk components @xcite .",
    "however , the conversion of millimeter flux into mass depends on the optical depth , dust opacity and temperature ; the higher optical depths and cooler dust temperatures in class i sources may therefore lead to higher masses . estimated disk masses for our best - fit disk+envelope models (  [ sec : dmass ] ) are larger than typically observed for class ii objects and are close to the values required for gravitational instability , providing support for the non - stationary accretion model .",
    "we have demonstrated the power of combining spatially - resolved images at multiple wavelengths with broadband spectral energy distributions when modeling the dust distributions around class i sources .",
    "low - density surface layers , hot inner regions , and cool outer regions are traced by optical / infrared scattered light , thermal mid - ir emission , and far - ir and millimeter emission , respectively .",
    "because images at these various wavelengths probe different regions of the circumstellar material , and even different emission mechanisms , they place tight constraints on the range of circumstellar dust models consistent with the data , especially when used in conjunction . in this section",
    "we discuss the near - future prospects for spatially resolved imaging of class i sources .",
    "although our marginally - resolved millimeter images place important constraints on the centrifugal and outer radii ( and viewing angle when combined with the position of near - ir scattered light ) , well - resolved images will provide better inclination constraints and useful additional information including direct measurement of the radial intensity profile and , in the best cases , the vertical intensity profile ; taken together these constrain the density and temperature profiles .",
    "analysis of spectral lines with different excitation conditions can probe directly the density and temperature structure .",
    "the enhanced angular resolutions and sensitivities of new and upcoming millimeter interferometers , including the sma , carma , and alma , will enable detailed studies of class i sources .    at shorter wavelengths , the fwhm angular sizes of our typical disk+envelope model images ( at 140 pc )",
    "are @xmath17 to @xmath195 at 70 to 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "though smaller than the beam size of _ spitzer _ , future far - ir interferometers such as the mission concepts _ spirit _ and _ specs _ will resolve this thermal emission . at 10 - 20 @xmath0",
    "m the emission is generated at small radii ( @xmath196 au ) , tracing dense material close to the star which can be studied with ground - based mid - ir interferometry .",
    "at 10 and 18 @xmath0 m , the fwhm sizes are @xmath197 and 40 mas , and the 1% emission contours lie at 140 and 280 mas , though at low flux levels ( @xmath198 mjy ) .",
    "current sparse - aperture interferometry with the keck telescope can achieve angular resolutions of @xmath199 mas for sources brighter than a few jy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while future instruments like lbti should yield additional improvements in resolution and sensitivity .",
    "future capabilities such as mid - infrared instrumentation on tmt may also be able to achieve the required resolution and sensitivity .",
    "we note that different density distributions ( e.g. , pure envelopes or pure disks ) can produce less centrally - peaked emission , which would lead to larger and thus more easily resolved images at infrared wavelengths .",
    "finally , spectroscopy from the _ spitzer space telescope _ will add valuable constraints on dust mineralogy and particle size distribution for class i sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the shape of spectral features can provide a sensitive probe of dust optical depth and source inclination .",
    "since different molecules , ices , and dust species arise in different physical conditions , _ spitzer _ observations will thus also provide powerful constrains on large - scale geometry .",
    "we imaged a sample of five embedded class i sources in the taurus star forming region in 0.9 @xmath0 m scattered light and thermal 1 mm continuum emission , and we analyzed these data together with spectral energy distributions and 10 @xmath0 m spectra from the literature . using the mc3d monte carlo radiative transfer code , we generated synthetic images and seds for four classes of models : 1 ) rotating infalling envelopes including outflow cavities ; 2 ) flared disks ; 3 ) disks+envelopes ; and 4 ) disks+extinction . for each class of model , we sampled small grids of relevant geometric parameters and determined the circumstellar dust distributions providing the best fits to our data in a @xmath61 sense .",
    "the imaging and sed data are generally inconsistent with either pure disk or pure envelope models , and we find that the best fits are obtained with models incorporating both massive envelopes and massive embedded disks . given the large centrifugal radii derived for our sample ( @xmath200 au ) , the need for massive disks is not necessarily surprising . while not included in the rotating infalling envelope model , one expects a dense disk of material interior to @xmath41 because of the growth of centrifugal radius with time : at earlier times , @xmath41 was smaller , and thus material should have gradually piled up at successively larger radii out to the current value of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , models incorporating both envelopes and disks may be the most accurate ( of those considered ) for representing physical infalling envelopes .",
    "however , our results indicate that refinements to the models are necessary .",
    "for example , disk+envelope models including disk components truncated at @xmath41 may yield disk masses closer to physically plausible values .",
    "in addition , our scattered light images point to the existence of extended , tenuous distributions of material , which must be included in the models in order to fit all of the data simultaneously . as more spatially - resolved data is collected over a broad range of wavelengths , further refinements to the models will likely be warranted .",
    "the overall geometry inferred for our sample of class i objects is neither spherically - symmetric , as expected for the earliest stages of cloud collapse , nor completely flattened as seen in class ii sources .",
    "thus , our models confirm the picture where class i sources are at an evolutionary stage intermediate to collapsing cores and fully assembled stars surrounded by disks .",
    "the mass infall rates derived for our sample are between @xmath201 m@xmath3 yr@xmath4 , consistent with previous results . however , these infall rates are more than an order of magnitude higher than accretion rates pertaining to the transfer of material from the disk onto the central star derived from high - dispersion spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy argues for periodic `` fu ori '' episodes of increased accretion : since infalling material is not accreted onto the star at the same rate , material piles up in the disk .",
    "once the disk becomes unstable to gravitational instability , the accretion rate rises dramatically for a short period , depleting the disk mass and restoring stability .",
    "the `` fu ori '' accretion hypothesis is also consistent with the high disk masses of disk+envelope models , which suggest disks near to the limit of gravitational stability .",
    "we have demonstrated the power of modeling broadband seds in conjunction with images at multiple wavelengths .",
    "in addition , we showed that 10 @xmath0 m spectra can provide valuable additional constraints on circumstellar geometry , since the depth and shape of spectral features depends on dust optical depth and source inclination .",
    "future observations with upcoming millimeter interferometers , the _ spitzer space telescope _ , and",
    "other instruments will provide additional spatially- and spectrally - resolved information , greatly enhancing constraints on the circumstellar dust around class i objects .",

    "as discussed in  [ sec : sample ] , we obtained 0.9 @xmath0 m images using keck / lris of the entire sample studied by @xcite .",
    "the details of these observations are described in  [ sec : lris ] .",
    "although the analysis presented above concentrated on only those sources that satisfied our selection criteria (  [ sec : sample ] ) , we display the lris images for the larger sample in figure [ fig : lris_all ] for completeness .",
    "several of these objects are detected strongly at 0.9 @xmath0 m : iras 04181 + 2654a , iras 04248 + 2612 , iras 04263 + 2436 , iras 04264 + 2433ab , iras 04287 + 1802 , iras 04303 + 2247 , iras 04361 + 2547ab , iras 04368 + 2557 , and iras 04489 + 3402 .",
    "four other sources exhibit faint smudges that may correspond to actual emission : iras 04169 + 2702 , iras 04181 + 2655 , iras 04325 + 2402 , and iras 04365 + 2635 .",
    "the remaining sources were not detected , with a limiting @xmath11-band magnitude of @xmath202 .",
    "photometry for these objects , measured within a @xmath14 diameter aperture , is listed in @xcite .",
    "because these images are not very deep ( @xmath203s ) , we can not comment on whether the pattern of detections and non - detections corresponds to variations in the underlying protostellar luminosities , different inclinations , or other factors .",
    "however , it is clear from figure [ fig : lris_all ] that there are several sources exhibiting bright scattered light structures ; these sources are ideal candidates for future work .",

    "<S> the implied envelope infall rates for these disk+envelope models are generally consistent with infall rates derived by previous investigators , although they are approximately an order of magnitude larger than inner disk accretion rates inferred from recent spectroscopic measurements . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the disk masses inferred from our models are close to or larger than the limit for gravitationally stable disks , indicating that class i disks may undergo periodic episodes of enhanced accretion , perhaps as a result of gravitational instabilities . an important caveat to these results </S>",
    "<S> is that in some cases , no single model can fit all of the imaging and sed data well , suggesting that further refinements to models of the circumstellar dust distributions around class i sources are necessary . </S>",
