    "cosmic magnetic fields , including the fields of planets , stars , and galaxies , result from the hydromagnetic dynamo effect @xcite . the last decades have seen tremendous progress in the analytical and numerical treatment of magnetic field generation in cosmic bodies .",
    "recently , the hydromagnetic dynamo effect has been validated experimentally in large liquid sodium facilities in riga and karlsruhe @xcite .",
    "the usual way to treat hydromagnetic dynamos numerically is within the differential equation approach . supposing the fluid velocity @xmath2 to be given , the governing differential equation is the induction equation for the magnetic field @xmath3 , @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 denoting the permeability of the free space and the electrical conductivity of the fluid , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) follows directly from pre - maxwell s equations and ohm s law in moving conductors .",
    "note that the magnetic field has to be divergence - free : @xmath7    in case of vanishing excitations of the magnetic field from outside the considered finite region , the boundary condition for the magnetic field reads @xmath8    the induction equation ( 1 ) is sufficient to treat _ kinematic dynamo models _ in which the back - reaction of the self - excited magnetic field on the flow is neglected .",
    "such a simplification is justified during the initial phase of self - excitation when the magnetic field is weak . for stronger fields",
    ", one has to cope with _ dynamically consistent dynamo models _ which require the simultaneous solution of the induction equation for the magnetic field and the navier - stokes equation for the velocity .",
    "this saturation regime , however , will not be considered in the present paper .",
    "the spherical geometry of many cosmic bodies such as planets and stars has simplified dynamo simulations in one important respect : for the spherical case the boundary conditions for the magnetic field can be re - formulated separately for every degree and order of the spherical harmonics , which makes any particular treatment of the magnetic fields in the exterior superfluous .    when it comes to dynamos in other than spherical geometries , this pleasant situation changes .",
    "then the correct handling of the non - local boundary conditions becomes non - trivial .",
    "such a problem appears , e.g. , in the numerical simulation of the recent dynamo experiments that are of cylindrical shape , but also in the simulations of galactic dynamos .",
    "there are some ways to circumvent this problem : one can use simplified local boundary conditions ( `` vertical field condition '' ) @xcite , one can embed the actual dynamo body into a sphere with the region between the actual dynamo and the surface of the sphere virtually filled with a medium of lower electrical conductivity @xcite , or one can solve the laplace equation in the exterior and fit the solution at the boundary to the solution in the interior @xcite , which is , however , a tedious and time - consuming procedure .    the integral equation approach",
    "that we will establish in the present paper is intended to change this unsatisfactory situation concerning the handling of boundary conditions . for the steady case , and for infinite domains of homogeneous conductivity , the integral equation approach was used in a few previous papers @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of boundaries , again for the steady case , was already delineated in the book of roberts @xcite . in roberts own opinion ( @xcite ,",
    "p. 74 ) , however , this formulation did `` ... not appear , in general , to be very useful . '' in @xcite",
    "we have tried to put this pessimistic judgment into question . in particular ,",
    "we have derived from the general theory a system of one - dimensional integral equations for a dynamo model with a spherically symmetric , isotropic helical turbulence parameter @xmath1 in a finite sphere , and we have re - derived analytically the solution found by krause and steenbeck @xcite for the special case of constant @xmath1 . in @xcite we have investigated the performance of numerical schemes to solve these integral equations for steady @xmath0 dynamos .    it should be pointed out that a similar approach had been established earlier under the label `` velocity - current - formulation '' by meir and schmidt @xcite .",
    "this approach had also the pronounced aim to circumvent the numerical treatment outside the region of interest . however , the numerical focus of this work laid more on steady , coupled mhd problems with small magnetic reynolds number than on dynamo problems .    in the present paper ,",
    "we generalize the integral equation approach for steady dynamos in finite domains to the time - dependent case .",
    "in contrast to earlier statements on this matter @xcite that the use of the green s function of the helmholtz equation will lead us to a non - linear eigenvalue equation , we present here a linear formulation of the eigenvalue problem .",
    "this makes the approach more attractive for numerical treatment .    for the paradigmatic case of",
    "a time - dependent spherically symmetric , isotropic @xmath0 dynamo we derive , starting from the general formulation , a coupled system of two radial integral equations which is solved numerically .",
    "the equivalence with the results of an differential equation solver is made evident .",
    "we also derive the coupled system of radial integral equations for spherical dynamos with general velocity fields , and treat numerically the well - known bullard - gellman model within the new approach .",
    "in this section , the general form of the integral equation approach is developed for time - dependent dynamos acting in an electrically conducting , non - magnetic fluid which occupies a finite domain @xmath9 with a boundary @xmath10 , surrounded by non - conducting space . under the assumption that the velocity or corresponding mean - field quantities are stationary",
    ", we generalize the basic idea and the methods from the steady case @xcite to the time - dependent case .",
    "we start with pre - maxwell s equations ( the displacement current can be skipped in the quasistationary approximation ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the magnetic field , @xmath13 the electric field , @xmath14 the position vector , @xmath15 the time , and @xmath5 the magnetic permeability of the free space .",
    "the current density @xmath16 satisfies ohm s law @xmath17 inside the dynamo domain @xmath9 , and it vanishes outside @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the electromotive force ( emf ) @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the velocity of the fluid motion , which we suppose to be stationary . in the framework of mean - field electrodynamics (",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath12 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 are split into mean fields and fluctuating fields .",
    "then @xmath18 can be fixed to the form @xmath21 where @xmath20 and @xmath12 now denote the mean velocity and the mean magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath22 describes the emf due to the non - mirrorsymmetric part of the turbulence ( @xmath1-effect ) , and the term @xmath23 describes another effect which can be interpreted as an conductivity decrease due to the turbulence ( @xmath24-effect ) .",
    "the equations given so far , together with initial conditions for @xmath25 , define an initial value problem for @xmath12 which can be combined into the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq0 ] ) .",
    "together with the requirements that there are no surface currents on @xmath10 and that @xmath12 vanishes at infinity , they allow to determine @xmath12 once the concrete dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath12 has been fixed .    under the condition that @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) only depend on the position @xmath14 , the functions @xmath13 , @xmath12 , @xmath18 and @xmath16 may be written in the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is in general a complex constant .",
    "then maxwell s equations and ohm s law transform into @xmath28 hereafter , the symbols @xmath25 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the functions which only depend on the position @xmath14 , but not on the time @xmath15 .",
    "since the magnetic field @xmath3 is divergence - free , there exists a magnetic vector potential @xmath32 such that @xmath33 which implies , together with eq .",
    "( [ eq8a ] ) , that @xmath34 therefore , @xmath35 has to be irrotational , and we can write @xmath36 subsequently , ohm s law gets the form @xmath37    in the following , we will derive a system of integral equations that is equivalent to the differential equation formulation .",
    "the starting point for the first integral equation is the application of biot - savart s law on eq .",
    "( [ eq8c ] ) , leading to @xmath38 it is well known that the @xmath39 operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq8c ] ) is a left inverse of the biot - savart operator when the current @xmath40 is divergence - free and tangent to the boundary of the domain @xcite .",

    "( [ eq13 ] ) in the form @xmath45 for the steady case ( @xmath46 ) eq . ( [ eq13 ] ) reduces to the form given in @xcite , with one volume integral over @xmath3 and one boundary integral over @xmath47 .",
    "the latter one would vanish only in the case that the dynamo region is extended to infinity .",
    "the time - dependence introduces now a new volume integral over @xmath3 , but also one boundary integral over the vector potential @xmath48 which can not be reduced to a simple expression in @xmath3 . before we focus on this point ,",
    "let us first derive the integral equation for @xmath47 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) and the demand that the current has to be divergence - free , @xmath49 , we get a poisson equation for @xmath47 : @xmath50 assuming vacuum boundary condition which means that the current must not leave the domain @xmath9 , we obtain from green s theorem the following boundary integral equation for @xmath47 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 for points @xmath53 inside @xmath9 , @xmath54 for points @xmath55 on @xmath10 and @xmath56 for points @xmath53 outside @xmath9 . again , another expression of the first volume integral might be useful : @xmath57 if we use the coulomb gauge for the vector potential , @xmath58 , we see that the second volume integral in eq . ( [ eq14 ] )",
    "of course , one is free to use other gauges than the coulomb gauge .",
    "one advantage of this gauge , in view of later numerical applications , is that it leads to a formulation in which the vector potential is only needed at the boundary of the domain .    for the steady case , eqs .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) with @xmath46 are sufficient to determine the magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "but for the time - dependent case presently under consideration , we have to introduce the vector potential @xmath48 , at least at the boundary , for completely formulating the problem .",
    "necessarily we have to establish another relation for @xmath48 in order to make the problem solvable . from eq .",

    "the main advantage of this formulation is that one can avoid any treatment of fields in the exteriour of @xmath9 .",
    "the boundary conditions are being fulfilled by solving the boundary integral equations for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    in the next section",
    "we will sketch how the equations for @xmath48 and @xmath47 at the boundary can be absorbed into a single integral equation for @xmath3 .",

    "( [ eq12 ] ) into the form of a helmholtz equation for the vector potential @xmath212 then , the pendant to eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) would read @xmath213 with @xmath214 without going into the details of such a formulation ( we skip here the equations for the electric potential and the vector potential at the boundary ) , we see immediately that we end up with a non - linear eigenvalue equation for the eigenvalue @xmath27",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the numerical performance of such a formulation with the present one .",
    "we plan to use our formulation for a number of dynamo problems , in particular problems which are connected with the design and optimization for new dynamo experiments and with velocity reconstruction problem for the existing experiments .",
    "in this part , we give another approach to establish the integral equations ( [ eq27 ] ) and ( [ eq41 ] ) .",
    "we start with the following differential equation problem : @xmath215+\\alpha(r)t_{lm},\\label{eq59}\\\\ \\lambda t_{lm}&=&\\frac{1}{\\mu_0\\sigma}[\\frac{d^2t_{lm}}{dr^2}- \\frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}t_{lm}]-\\frac{d}{dr}(\\alpha(r)\\frac{ds_{lm}}{dr})+ \\frac{l(l+1)}{r^2}\\alpha(r)s_{lm},\\label{eq60}\\\\ t_{lm}(r)&=&r\\frac{ds_{lm}}{dr}|_{r = r}+l s_{lm}(r)=0,\\label{eq61}\\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] first , we derive the green s function , @xmath216 , corresponding to the equation ( [ eq59 ] ) .",
    "this green s function satisfies : @xmath217 according to the construction method of green s functions ( @xcite , p. 355 ) , we obtain @xmath216 in the following form : @xmath218 as for eq .",
    "( [ eq60 ] ) , we first rewrite it in the form : @xmath219 where @xmath220 . this differential equation problem for @xmath110 can be split into two problems .",
    "one of them reads @xmath221 the other is @xmath222 for the differential equation problem ( [ eq68 ] ) , applying the construction method of green s function ( @xcite ) again , we obtain its green s function in the form : @xmath223 which satisfies @xmath224    as for the differential equation problem ( [ eq69 ] ) , the solution can be expressed as : @xmath225 then the superposition theorem of the linear problems allows us to obtain the following integral equations for @xmath226 and @xmath110 : @xmath227 integrating by parts the terms containing derivatives of @xmath226 in eq .",
    "( [ eq73 ] ) , we obtain @xmath228 therefore , we have obtained the same integral equations as expressed in eqs .",

    "<S> the second and perhaps most important advantage is its applicability to dynamos in arbitrary geometries . </S>",
    "<S> the third advantage is its intimate connection to inverse problems relevant not only for dynamos but also for technical applications of magnetohydrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the paper provides the first general formulation and application of the integral equation approach to time - dependent kinematic dynamos in finite domains . for the spherically symmetric @xmath0 dynamo model </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how the general formulation is reduced to a coupled system of two radial integral equations for the defining scalars of the poloidal and the toroidal field components . the integral equation formulation for spherical dynamos with general velocity fields is also derived . two numerical examples , the @xmath0 dynamo model with radially varying @xmath1 , and the bullard - gellman model illustrate the equivalence of the approach with the usual differential equation method . </S>"
