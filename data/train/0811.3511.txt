    "since the liquid drop model was developed @xcite , the quadrupole shape coordinates were widely used by both phenomenological and microscopic formalisms to describe the basic properties of nuclear systems .",
    "based on these coordinates , one defines quadrupole boson operators in terms of which model hamiltonians and transition operators are defined . since the original spherical harmonic liquid drop model was able to describe only a small amount of data for spherical nuclei , several improvements have been added .",
    "thus , the bohr - mottelson model was generalized by faessler and greiner @xcite in order to describe the small oscillations around a deformed shape which results in obtaining a flexible model , called vibration rotation model , suitable for the description of deformed nuclei .",
    "later on @xcite this picture was extended by including anharmonicities as low order invariant polynomials in the quadrupole coordinates . with a suitable choice of the parameters involved in the model hamiltonian the equipotential energy surface may exhibit several types of minima @xcite like spherical , deformed prolate , deformed oblate , deformed triaxial , etc . to each equilibrium shape , specific properties for excitation energies and electromagnetic transition probabilities show up . due to this reason",
    ", one customarily says that static values of intrinsic coordinates determine a phase for the nuclear system . a weak point of the boson description with a complex anharmonic hamiltonian consists of the large number of the structure parameters which are to be fitted",
    ". a much smaller number of parameters is used by the coherent state model ( csm ) @xcite which uses a restricted collective space generated through angular momentum projection by three deformed orthogonal functions of coherent type .",
    "the model is able to describe in a realistic fashion transitional and well deformed nuclei of various shapes including states of high and very high angular momentum .",
    "various extensions to include other degrees of freedom like isospin @xcite , single particle @xcite or octupole @xcite degrees of freedom have been formulated @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that a given nuclear phase may be associated to a certain symmetry .",
    "hence , its properties may be described with the help of the irreducible representation of the respective symmetry group .",
    "thus , the gamma unstable nuclei can be described by the @xmath7 symmetry @xcite , the symmetric rotor by the @xmath8 symmetry and the spherical vibrator by the @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "the gamma triaxial nuclei are characterized by the invariance symmetry group @xmath10 @xcite of the rigid triaxial rotor hamiltonian .",
    "thus , even in the 50 s , the symmetry properties have been greatly appreciated . however",
    ", a big push forward was brought by the interacting boson approximation ( iba ) @xcite , which succeeded to describe the basic properties of a large number of nuclei in terms of the symmetries associated to a system of quadrupole ( d ) and monopole ( s ) bosons which generate a @xmath11 algebra .",
    "the three limiting symmetries @xmath9 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , are dynamic symmetries for @xmath11 . moreover , for each of these symmetries a specific group reduction chain provides the quantum numbers characterizing the states , which are suitable for a certain region of nuclei . besides the virtue of unifying the group theoretical descriptions of nuclei exhibiting different symmetries",
    ", the procedure defines very simple reference pictures for the limiting cases . for nuclei lying close to the region characterized by a certain symmetry ,",
    "the perturbative corrections are to be included .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a new classification scheme was provided , all nuclei being distributed within a symmetry triangle .",
    "the vertices of this triangle symbolize the @xmath9 ( vibrator ) , @xmath7 ( gamma soft ) and @xmath8 ( symmetric rotor ) , while the legs of the triangle denote the transitional region .",
    "properties of nuclei lying far from vertices are difficult to be explained since the states have some characteristics of one vertex while some others are easy to be described by using the adjacent symmetry .",
    "the transition from one phase to another reaches a critical point depending on the specific parametrization as well as on the transition type @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been proved that on the @xmath12 transition leg there exists a critical point for a second order phase transition while the @xmath13 leg has a first order phase transition .",
    "recently , iachello @xcite pointed out that these critical points correspond to distinct symmetries , namely @xmath14 and @xmath2 , respectively . for the critical value of an ordering parameter",
    ", energies are given by the zeros of a bessel function of half integer and irrational indices , respectively .",
    "the description of low lying states in terms of bessel functions was used first by jean and willet @xcite , but the interesting feature saying that this is a critical picture in a phase transition and defines a new symmetry , was indeed advanced first in ref.@xcite .",
    "representatives for the two symmetries have been experimentally identified . to give an example",
    ", the relevant data for @xmath15ba @xcite and @xmath16sm @xcite suggest that they are close to the @xmath14 and @xmath2 symmetries , respectively .",
    "another candidate for e(5 ) symmetry , proposed by zamfir _",
    "@xcite is @xmath17pd . using a simple iba hamiltonian , in ref.@xcite",
    ", the low lying spectrum of @xmath18pd is realistically described . comparing the e(5 ) predictions with the experimental data concerning energy ratios in the ground band and the normalized e2 transition probabilities for the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 ,",
    "one concludes that this nucleus is a good e(5 ) candidate .",
    "however , in order to decide which pd isotope is closer to an e(5 ) behavior , further investigations are necessary . a systematic search for @xmath14 behavior in nuclei has been reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "short after the pioneering papers concerning critical point symmetries appeared , some other attempts have been performed , using other potentials like coulomb , kratzer @xcite and davidson potentials @xcite .",
    "these potentials yield also schrdinger solvable equations and the corresponding results may be interpreted in terms of symmetry groups .",
    "in ref.@xcite we advanced the hypothesis that the critical point in a phase transition is state dependent .",
    "we tested this with a hybrid model for @xmath15ba and @xmath21ru .",
    "the departure from the gamma unstable picture has been treated by several authors whose contributions are reviewed by fortunato in ref.@xcite .",
    "the difficulty in treating the gamma degree of freedom consists in the fact that this is coupled to the rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "a full solution for the bohr - mottelson hamiltonian including an explicit treatment of gamma deformation can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "therein , we treated separately also the gamma unstable and the rotor hamiltonian . a more complete study of the rotor hamiltonian and the distinct phases associated to a tilted moving rotor is given in ref . @xcite .",
    "distinct solutions , expressed in laboratory frame shape coordinates , have been reported in refs .",
    "the gamma dependent part of the wave function has been found as a solution of a specific differential equation in ref.@xcite .",
    "finding the @xmath1 depending part of the wave function becomes even more complicated when we add to the liquid drop hamiltonian a potential depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1 at a time . to simplify the starting problem related to the inclusion of @xmath1 one uses model potentials which are sums of a @xmath0 term , @xmath22 , and a factorized @xmath23 term @xmath24 . in this way",
    "the nice feature for the beta variable to be decoupled from the remaining four variables , specific to the harmonic liquid drop , is preserved . in the next step , the potential in gamma",
    "is expanded around @xmath25 or @xmath26 . in the first case",
    "if only the singular term is retained one obtains the infinite square well model described by bessel functions in @xmath1 .",
    "if the @xmath27 term is added to this term , the laguerre functions are the eigenstates of the approximated @xmath1 depending hamiltonian , which results in defining the so called x(5 ) approach .",
    "note that any approximation applied to the @xmath1-hamiltonian modifies automatically the differential equation for @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , the centrifugal term @xmath28 disappears but another one is expected to come from the @xmath23 coupling after some approximations are performed .",
    "the drawback of these approximations consist in that the resulting functions are not periodic , as the starting hamiltonian is .",
    "moreover , they are orthonormalized on unbound intervals although the underlying equation was derived under the condition of @xmath3 small .",
    "moreover , the scalar product of the resulting functions is not defined with the integration measure @xmath29 as happens in the liquid drop model . under these circumstances",
    "it happens that the approximated hamiltonian in @xmath1 looses its hermiticity .    in a previous short publication @xcite we proposed a scheme where the @xmath1 hamiltonian is solvable hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , its eigenstates are the spheroidal functions , which are periodic . also one proves that the x(5 ) model is recovered in the limit of @xmath1-small .",
    "here we give details about the calculations and describe some new numerical applications .",
    "moreover , we complete our formalism by considering a schrdinger equation in the beta coordinate , involving a potential of the davidson s type .    by the numerical applications we want to see whether curing the mentioned drawbacks for gamma wave functions and hamiltonian , would bring substantial quantitative corrections to energies and e2 transitions given by the @xmath2 formalism . even if the found corrections are not dramatic the virtue of the proposed formalism to extend the @xmath2 description to a theory which is consistent with the symmetries of the starting hamiltonian as well with some basic principles of quantum mechanics concerning the hermiticity property of the model hamiltonian remains an important achievement of the present paper .",
    "the above objectives are reached according to the following plan .",
    "the starting hamiltonian is presented in section ii , where the separability conditions are discussed .",
    "several methods for treating @xmath0 are described in subsection a while the hamiltonian in @xmath1 is studied in subsection b. the specific procedure of the present paper is presented in section iii .",
    "numerical applications are given in section iv .",
    "the final conclusions are summarized in section v.",
    "written in the intrinsic frame of reference , the original bohr - mottelson hamiltonian has the expression : @xmath30+v(\\beta,\\gamma ) , \\label{has}\\ ] ] where the dynamic deformation variables are denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 while the intrinsic angular momentum components by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . within the liquid drop model the potential energy depends quadratically on @xmath0 .",
    "here we assume that the potential energy depends on both deformation variables , beta and gamma . without exception",
    "the solvable models proposed for a simultaneous description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables adopt the variable separation methods .",
    "two situations are to be distinguished :    \\a ) if the potential energy term is depending on deformation variables in a separable manner : @xmath33 and some additional assumptions are adopted , the eigenvalue equation associated to @xmath34 ( [ has ] ) can be separated in two parts , one equation describing the beta variable and the other one the gamma deformation and the euler angles @xmath35 . indeed , in this case the separation of variables , achieved by various models , is based on two approximations @xcite : i ) restriction to small values of @xmath1 , i. e. @xmath36 ; ii ) replacing the factor @xmath37 by @xmath38 in the terms involved in the equation for @xmath1 .",
    "the diagonalization of the bohr - mottelson hamiltonian shows that the first approximation is valid for large @xmath1 stiffness while the second one for small @xmath1 stiffness @xcite .",
    "\\b ) a complete separation of equations for the two variables , @xmath0 and @xmath1 is possible if we choose the potential @xmath39 in this way the approximation consisting of replacing @xmath40 by @xmath41 is avoided but the restriction to the case @xmath36 is still kept .",
    "thus , the theory involves one parameter which is the @xmath1 stiffness which affects the excitation energies in both the beta and gamma bands .    in what follows the two equations , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , will be considered separately .",
    "the solvable models for @xmath0 , presented here , have been used by e(5 ) formalisms , which ignore the potential in @xmath1 . considering the potential in @xmath1 , of course , the picture for @xmath0 is changed . however , as we shall see later on , it is very easy to derive analytically the energies and wave functions associated to @xmath0 from the corresponding results of the e(5 ) descriptions .",

    "concluding the numerical analysis of this section we may say that the formalism presented here has not only the merit of removing two drawbacks of the previous x(5 ) model ( the functions in @xmath1 are not periodic while the hamiltonian is not hermitian . ) but also provides a better quantitative description .",
    "here we shall summarize the main results presented in the present paper . starting with the differential equation for @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables , involving also the euler angles , provided by the liquid drop model",
    ", one may define analytically solvable equations for both deformation variables .",

    "two specific features are considered as drawbacks of the model : 1)the function describing the variable @xmath1 are non - periodic functions and moreover are normalized to unity on a non - bounded interval .",
    "these two properties conflict the symmetry properties required by the starting liquid drop hamiltonian .",
    "2)in particular if we preserve the integration measure for @xmath1 to be @xmath129 then the hamiltonian depending on @xmath1 is not hermitian .",

    "the solution offered here is to use in the @xmath1 space a hamiltonian which has the spheroidal functions as eigenstates .",
    "these functions are , indeed , periodic in the interval @xmath134 $ ] . moreover , the model hamiltonian is hermitian with respect to the integration measure @xmath129",
    ". another solution would be the use of a @xmath1- hamiltonian which admits the mathiew functions as eigenfunctions .",
    "however , applications based on this solution are postponed for another publication . we have proved that both solutions lead the x(5 ) model in the limit of @xmath3 small . as regards the @xmath0 variable ,",
    "the description is performed with the generalized laguerre functions which are solutions of a schrdinger equation involving the davidson s potential .",
    "a particular case of this description is the situation when the centrifugal terms is vanishing , i.e. @xmath294 . of course , that is the oscillator potential in @xmath0 .",

    "one notes that the gamma band energies are better described by the present approach . as a matter of fact the x(5 )",
    "calculations fail to reproduce the excitation energies in the gamma band of @xmath6os . in the case of @xmath5gd",
    "we compared the theoretical results of this paper with those obtained with two versions of the coherent state model .",
    "the qualities of the agreement with the experimental data obtained with the three sets of calculations are comparable with each other .",
    "the essential difference is that csm works quite well for all even @xmath296 isotopes while the @xmath2-type models work only for the critical point of the shape phase transition .",
