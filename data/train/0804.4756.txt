    "heavy - quark potentials are of primary importance in studying the mass spectra of mesons and baryons .",
    "they have been computed in lattice simulations , and the results reveal a remarkable agreement with phenomenology .    until recently , the lattice formulation even struggling with limitations and systematic errors was the main computational tool to deal with strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "the situation changed drastically with the invention of the ads / cft correspondence that resumed interest in finding a string description of strong interactions .",
    "in this paper we continue a series of studies @xcite devoted to the heavy quark potentials and pseudo - potentials within a five - dimensional framework nowadays known as ads / qcd . in @xcite ,",
    "the model was presented for computing the quark - antiquark potential .",
    "the resulting potential is coulomb - like at short distances and linear at long range .",
    "subsequent work @xcite has made it clear that the model should be taken seriously , particularly in the context of consistency with the available lattice data as well as phenomenology . in @xcite ,",
    "the models were presented for computing the quark - antiquark pseudo - potentials resulting from the spatial wilson loops .",
    "the results obtained for the spatial string tensions are remarkably consistent with the available lattice data for temperatures up to @xmath2 .",
    "the question naturally arises : what happens when these models are used for computing multi - quark potentials or pseudo - potentials ?",
    "the multi - quark potentials have recently been the object of numerical studies . in the case of great interest , three quark states in a @xmath0 gauge theory ,",
    "the potential is well described by a simple model @xcite    @xmath3    here @xmath4 is a constant .",
    "the quarks form a triangle with sides of lengths @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the minimal length of the string network which has a junction at the fermat point of the triangle @xcite .",
    "thus , the potential is given by the sum of the coulomb terms and the linear term called the y - law .",
    "a remarkable fact is that @xmath7 is equal to @xmath8 found from the quark - antiquark potential .",
    "this is obvious in the string picture , where the string tension is universal , but it is far from being so in the lattice formulation .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we examine the multi - quark potentials that may also be thought of as a further cross - check of the model @xcite .",
    "second , we make a similar analysis of the multi - quark pseudo - potentials . to our knowledge , there have been no studies ( numerical or analytical ) of this problem in the literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the multi - quark potentials .",
    "we begin with the three - quark potential . in this case",
    ", we demonstrate the y - law and the universality of the string tension . finally , we extend our analysis to the @xmath1 case .",
    "we then go on in section 3 to discuss the multi - quark pseudo - potentials .",
    "here we also demonstrate the y - law , the universality of the spatial string tension , and possible generalizations to @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude in section 4 with a brief discussion of possibilities for further study .",
    "some technical details are given in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we will discuss static multi - quark potentials .",
    "we start with the three - quark potential in a @xmath0 gauge theory , where equations are most elementary . in section 2.4 ,",
    "similar issues are considered in the context of a @xmath1 gauge theory .      as for the quark - antiquark potential",
    ", the static three - quark potential can be determined from the expectation value of a wilson loop .",
    "the baryonic loop is defined in a gauge - invariant manner as @xmath9 , with the path - ordered exponents @xmath10 along the lines shown in figure 1 .        in the limit @xmath11",
    "the expectation value of the wilson loop is    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the three - quark potential .    in discussing baryonic wilson loops",
    ", we adapt a formalism proposed within the ads / cft correspondence @xcite to ads / qcd .",
    "so , we place heavy quarks at the boundary points of the five - dimensional space and consider a configuration in which each of the quarks is the endpoint of a fundamental string , with all the strings oriented in the same way .",
    "the strings join at a baryon vertex in the interior as shown in figure 2 .",
    ", with @xmath14 a 5-dimensional compact space and @xmath15 a _ timelike _ curve in @xmath16 or its deformed version , @xcite . in ads",
    "/ qcd , it is reduced to a zerobrane ( point ) . ]",
    "we also assume that the quarks form a triangle @xmath17 such that all the internal angles are smaller than @xmath18 .    before proceeding to the detailed analysis ,",
    "let us set the five - dimensional geometry .",
    "we consider the following deformation of the euclidean @xmath16 @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a free parameter .",

    "] we also take a constant dilaton and discard other background fields .",
    "the action of the system has in addition to the standard nambu - goto actions of the fundamental strings , also a contribution arising from the baryon vertex .",
    "it is thus    @xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes the action of the string connecting the @xmath24-quark with the vertex .    like in the case of the quark - antiquark potential , a natural proposal for the expectation value of the wilson loop",
    "is    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the minimal action of the system .    since we are interested in a static configuration , we take    @xmath27    here @xmath28 are worldsheet coordinates .",

    "unfortunately , the explicit form of @xmath33 is not determined only from the 5-dimensional metric .",
    "it requires the knowledge of the string theory dual to qcd .",
    "we will return to this issue in the next section .",

    "then we replace @xmath62 with @xmath65 as in .",
    "finally , the regularized expression takes the form @xmath66 its @xmath64-expansion is @xmath67 subtracting the @xmath68 term ( quark masses ) and letting @xmath69 , we find a finite result    @xmath70 + c \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 stands for a normalization constant .",
    "in contrast to the quark - antiquark case , the potential in question is more involved .",

    "we can , however , gain some important insights into the problem from two limiting cases as well as numerical calculations .",
    "we start by noting that eq .",
    "makes sense only if @xmath89 .",
    "this means that @xmath43 must obey @xmath90 so in other words , the baryon vertex is prevented from getting deeper into the @xmath91-direction .",
    "this gives a kind of wall which is a generic feature of confining theories .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same upper bound was found in the quark - antiquark case @xcite by inspecting the integral at @xmath92 .",
    "the point is that the integral is real for @xmath93 .",
    "it develops a logarithmic singularity at @xmath94 and becomes complex for larger @xmath83 .",
    "a similar analysis shows that if @xmath95 this holds for smaller @xmath96 too . for @xmath97 things",
    "are more subtle because of a lower bound @xmath98 here @xmath99 is a root of @xmath100 .",
    "the physical reason for this is a big mass of the \" particle  that strengthens a gravitational force pushing the baryon vertex deeper into the interior . as a result , for small @xmath88",
    "the configuration looks like a spike of height @xmath99 .",
    "the fact that both the equations and lead to the same upper bound suggests that neither strings nor baryon vertices are allowed to get deeper into the @xmath91-direction than @xmath101 .",
    "this seems natural enough from the point of view of consistency .    to complete the picture ,",
    "let us present the results of numerical calculations .",
    "the parametric equation predicts a characteristic form of @xmath88 , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "we see that the curves behave similarly in the vicinity of @xmath94 but rather differently for smaller @xmath83 .",
    "this has an interesting effect on the form of the interquark potential , as we will see in a moment .",
    "having understood the correspondence between @xmath83 and @xmath88 , we can investigate the properties of the interquark interaction at long and short distances .    at long distances the interquark interaction being independent of @xmath102 is given by    @xmath103    that is nothing but the desired y - law . here",
    "@xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "some comments about formula are in order .",
    "first , the form of the potential is in agreement with both the old flux - tube picture of hadrons and more recent calculations in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "however , the key difference is that in our model the interaction takes place in the interior of five - dimensional space , whereas in those it happens on its boundary . next , the tension @xmath7 is the same as that found from the quark - antiquark potential @xcite .",
    "thus , the model also supports the universality of the string tension .",
    "finally , to leading order the energy is the sum of the string contributions .",
    "a contribution from the baryon vertex appears at next - to - leading - order .    at short distances",
    "the form of the interquark interaction depends on the value of @xmath102 .",
    "we have the coulomb terms    @xmath106    with @xmath107 a distance between the quarks , if and only if @xmath108 .",
    "in other cases , the energy behaves as @xmath109 .    just as in the examples discussed in the ads / cft formulation @xcite , in the contribution of the baryon vertex is compatible to that of the strings .",
    "the reason for this is obvious : in the region of small @xmath91 the metric behaves asymptotically as euclidean @xmath16 .    as an illustration ,",
    "figure 4 shows the results of numerical calculations .",
    "we see that the value of @xmath102 does matter     for fixed @xmath102 .",
    "we set @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112.,width=198 ]    at short distances , while it becomes irrelevant at large distances .",
    "we conclude this section by making a few estimates , which might be of interest for phenomenology .",
    "as already noted , in ads / cft the baryon vertex is the wrapped fivebrane . for definiteness , consider type iib string theory on @xmath113 .",

    "moreover , we learn that @xmath119 .    at first sight",
    ", it seems reasonable to fix the value of @xmath102 by equating @xmath120 and @xmath121 . a little experimentation with mathematica shows , however , that this results in a negative value . if we assume that @xmath122 , then there are positive @xmath102 s for @xmath123 s relatively close to @xmath124 , as given in table 1 .",

    "then the value one needs is bounded from above by a number of order @xmath128 .",

    ". becomes small for large t hooft coupling , the phenomenological estimate of @xcite gives @xmath130 .",
    "the latter suggests that @xmath129 corrections are relevant for the real world and a departure from the supergravity approximation is needed .",
    "] however , there is also a possibility that the string formulation being reliable at large distances provides only a qualitative description of the physics at short distances .",
    "apparently , one of the requirements for the multi - quark model should be consistency with the quark - antiquark case : as long as the fundamental strings are prevented from getting deeper into the @xmath91-direction , the baryon vertex , as a string endpoint , should also be prevented from doing so .",
    "our next goal will be to understand the large distance behavior of the multi - quark potential from this point of view .    to implement this approach",
    ", we assume that : 1 ) the baryon potential @xmath131 is a positive and regular function of @xmath43 such that it reaches the minimum exactly at @xmath132 ; 2 ) @xmath133 as @xmath43 tends to zero or infinity .",
    "the latter means that the vertex ca nt come very close to the boundary as well as go far away from it .",
    "these conditions allow us to conclude that the last equation of makes sense only if @xmath43 is subject to the constraint .",
    "we also learn that @xmath134 as @xmath135 .    if we look at eq .",

    "however , this is not the whole story . we still need to show that @xmath76 is the fermat point of the triangle formed by the quarks . the simplest way to see this is to take the limit @xmath134 in the first two equations of which determine the location of the vertex on the @xmath143 plane .",
    "we have thus    @xmath144    obviously , these equations is a result of differentiating the sum @xmath145 with respect to @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "because a solution    @xmath146    determines the fermat point , in this limit @xmath76 tends to the fermat point of the triangle .",
    "this completes our derivation of the y - law .",
    "now we consider the case @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis is a little bit more complicated but the results are very similar .",
    "by analogy with section 2.1 , we place @xmath147 heavy quarks on the boundary of the five - dimensional space .",
    "because in a generic case the quarks are not on the same plane , we need to involve the third spatial coordinate @xmath148 .",
    "so , the quarks are fixed in @xmath149 at points @xmath150 with coordinates @xmath151 .",
    "the configuration of interest is constructed as the @xmath147 quarks joined together by the @xmath147 fundamental strings ending at the baryon vertex in the interior of the five - dimensional space whose metric takes the form .",

    "after choosing the gauge , the action of the @xmath24-string takes the form    @xmath152    the boundary conditions are given by eq .",
    "together with    @xmath153    in addition to the first integrals of section 2.1 , which correspond to euler - lagrange equations for the fields @xmath39 and @xmath40 , there is one more integral due to translational invariance in the @xmath148-direction . combining it with results in    @xmath154    these equations yield solutions    @xmath155    which coincide at the endpoints with the boundary values defined in .    extremizing the action with respect to the location of the vertex , we get , with the upper bound of summation given by @xmath147 , and    @xmath156    that determines the location of the baryon vertex along the @xmath148-direction . note that now @xmath157 .    like in the case @xmath158",

    "it is also straightforward to extend the analysis of section 2.3 to the case of interest .",
    "assuming the same form of @xmath33 , we quickly come to the similar conclusions about the bound and large values of @xmath72 .",
    "continuing along those lines leads to the asymptotic behaviors as and .",
    "finally , we get    @xmath159    as before the string tension @xmath160 is equal to that of the quark - antiquark case .    to complete the picture",
    ", we should check that @xmath71 given by the above formula is minimum .",
    "the essential point is to take the limit @xmath134 in the equations determining the vertex location .",

    "the total action of the system is then given by the sum of the string actions and the action for the vertex .",
    "because we are interested in the configuration independent of @xmath148 , for the worldsheet coordinates we can choose    @xmath170    with such a choice , the action of the @xmath24-string is then    @xmath171    as before , for the baryon vertex we take the action of the form    @xmath172    the boundary conditions on the fields are given by .",

    "note that at higher temperatures it is determined by the @xmath203-function of a pure @xmath0 gauge theory @xcite .",
    "clearly , our model can not reproduce logarithms associated with the running coupling . instead",
    ", it provides a complementary description in the strong coupling regime .",
    "the above analysis can be easily generalized to the case @xmath1 . compared to the discussion of section 2.4 ,",
    "the points @xmath150 are now on the @xmath47-@xmath78 plane .",
    "hence , we need nt to involve any additional coordinate . the formal modification to be made is to extend the upper bound of summation to @xmath147 .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension is given by that is the desired result @xcite .",
    "we have so far discussed the configurations including a single baryon vertex . in general , it is possible to consider configurations with an arbitrary number of vertices : string networks .",
    "to give an idea of how this works , let us consider , though only schematically , the tetraquark case that is the four - quark potential @xmath204 .",
    "we place quarks and anti - quarks at boundary points @xmath150 and @xmath205 , respectively .",
    "these points are endpoints of fundamental strings .",
    "there are two basic configurations , as sketched in figure 7 .",
    "the connected configuration includes five strings beginning at the boundary points and        ending on the baryon and anti - baryon vertices in the interior of the five - dimensional space .",
    "the disconnected configuration , a \" two - meson  state , includes two strings stretched between the quarks and anti - quarks .    for the tetraquark potential ,",
    "there is a well - known \" flip - flop@xcite . when the quarks and anti - quarks are well separated , the potential is given by coulomb terms plus a term which indicates the formation of the two - y flux . on the other hand ,",
    "when the quarks and anti - quarks are close , the potential becomes a sum of two quark - antiquark potentials . clearly , these two possibilities correspond to our connected and disconnected configurations .    from the point of view of 10-dimensional string theory ,",
    "it is very easy to understand why the disconnected configuration dominates at small separations .",
    "the connected configuration includes the baryon and anti - baryon vertices that is nothing but a brane - antibrane system in @xmath206 dimensions .",
    "there is a critical separation for such a system . for smaller separations ,",
    "the open string spectrum consists of a tachyon mode .",
    "the instability associated with the tachyon represents a flow toward annihilation of the brane - antibrane system .",

    "zakharov , and p. weisz for discussions and comments .",
    "we begin with the case of long distances . as in figure 3 ,",
    "large @xmath88 s correspond to values of @xmath83 near @xmath141 . for @xmath135 , the integrals in and can be evaluated to give , where they take the form @xmath207 .",
    "the remaining integral may be found in @xcite . ]            in a similar spirit , we can explore the short distance behavior of @xmath71 . for @xmath95 ,",
    "this is simple because we need to take the limit @xmath210 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "expanding the right - hand sides of and in powers of @xmath83 , at leading order we obtain                      for larger values of @xmath102 , the analysis is a bit more involved because of the lower bound . in this case",
    "we need to take the limit @xmath222 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "note that @xmath223 .",
    "a simple but somewhat tedious calculation shows that in the neighbor of @xmath224 the length @xmath88 and the energy behave as            99 g.s .",
