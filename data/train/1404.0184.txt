    "the first modern explanation of the chemical bond between two neutral hydrogen atoms was put forth in 1927 by heitler and london  @xcite , and is one of the earliest applications of quantum theory , specifically that of schrdinger s wave mechanics formulation in 1926  @xcite .",
    "heitler and london showed that by accounting for pauli s exclusion principle  @xcite in combining atomic hydrogen wavefunctions to construct molecular wavefunctions , the existence of a bound molecular state is explained . despite their calculated binding energy being off by some 30% from the contemporary experimental value ,",
    "their pioneering quantum mechanical calculation for the stability of molecular hydrogen ushered the era of quantum chemistry .",
    "it is interesting to note that the born - oppenheimer approximation  @xcite was also proposed in 1927 , and this approach of separating electronic and nuclear motions has largely shaped molecular theory since .",
    "the next breakthrough in _ ab initio _  potential calculations for h@xmath0 was achieved by james and coolidge in 1933 in their treatment of the ( @xmath8 ) ground state @xcite . using two - electron wave functions with explicitly correlated electrons , an approach introduced by hylleraas for the helium atom  @xcite",
    ", they transcended the concept of electrons being in individual states as used in the hartree - fock method .",
    "the james - coolidge solution relied on the variational method to determine the correct nonlinear parameters in combining the wave functions . with a set of only 13 of these wave functions , taken as a truncated basis to represent the total hilbert space of infinite dimension",
    ", they improved the minimum energy in the born - oppenheimer potential of the @xmath9 state to @xmath10 @xmath2 .",
    "this was a substantial improvement of about @xmath11 @xmath2  with respect to the best theoretical values available at the time . over the years improvements on the accuracy",
    "has been obtained  @xcite , and important methodical reviews can be found in refs .",
    "the achievement of the initial studies of james and coolidge  @xcite can best be appreciated considering that further improvement in the calculated potential has been only 222  @xmath2  since then , obtained by wolniewicz in 1995 with essentially the same method but with a basis of 883 wave functions @xcite . at present , the born - oppenheimer potential energy can be evaluated to accuracies better than 15 digits using more than 22,000 basis functions @xcite , made possible by developments in numerical procedures and improvements in computing power .",
    "the precision of the calculated born - oppenheimer energy may be considered exact for the purpose of comparisons with experiment .",
    "corrections beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation need to be evaluated to improve upon the accuracy of the _ ab initio",
    "_  values .",
    "in addition to adiabatic and nonadiabatic effects comprising the non - relativistic born - oppenheimer corrections , it is also necessary to account for accurate relativistic and radiative or quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) corrections . until up to 2010",
    ", the work of wolniewicz  @xcite that included estimates of radiative corrections , had constituted the state - of - the - art for calculations of level energies in the @xmath8 ground state of molecular hydrogen .",
    "this led to a calculated energy of the actual ground state ( or equivalently the dissociation limit ) to an accuracy 0.01  @xmath2 .",
    "the recent work of pachucki , komasa and co - workers has achieved breakthroughs in the evaluation of nonadiabatic effects  @xcite as well as relativistic and radiative corrections  @xcite , resulting in accurate level energies of @xmath8 rovibrational levels  @xcite . in fig .",

    "theoretical and experimental efforts on the determination of ground state level energies in molecular hydrogen mutually stimulated improvements on both fronts as soon as more accurate values were obtained .",
    "as an illustration , consider the dissociation energy of the @xmath8 ground state , a benchmark quantity for the comparison of experiment and theory .",
    "the experimental determination of the dissociation energy by witmer  @xcite in 1926 already gave results within 3@xmath16 of the modern value , an order of magnitude better than the heitler - london calculations as mentioned .",
    "the james - coolidge calculations in 1933  @xcite resulted in a dissociation energy that is within @xmath17 of the present value , matched later by the experimental determination by beutler in 1935  @xcite that was also accurate to within @xmath17 .",
    "this lively dynamics continued through the 1960s-1970s , between the experimental efforts of herzberg and co - workers  @xcite and theoretical efforts by koos and co - workers  @xcite . in the middle of the 1990s ,",
    "the theoretical result of wolniewicz  @xcite for the dissociation energy was expressed in 8 significant digits , although the uncertainty was not explicitly mentioned .",
    "eyler and co - workers determined the dissociation limit to an accuracy of 0.01 @xmath2  @xcite in 2004 , improving upon their previous result  @xcite using the same method .",
    "the most accurate experimental dissociation energy for h@xmath15  was obtained in 2009 by liu  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and later extended to d@xmath15  @xcite and hd  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , accurate theoretical values for h@xmath15  and d@xmath15  dissociation energies  @xcite as well as hd  @xcite were presented a short time thereafter .",
    "_ ab initio _ theory can also be tested through a comparison with the experimental determinations of level splittings in the rovibrational manifold of the ground state .",
    "herzberg first predicted , in 1938 , that it should be possible to record rovibrational transitions in the ground state manifold  @xcite , and later discovered the quadrupole spectrum in 1949 by photographing a total of eight lines in the ( 2,0 ) and ( 3,0 ) bands  @xcite .",
    "subsequently the quadrupole spectrum including the fundamental ( 1,0 ) band was investigated by several other groups , for example by rank and co - workers  @xcite .",

    "@xcite greatly improved the accuracy of the spectroscopy of the quadrupole bands and was until recent years considered as the most accurate work on the direct measurement of the vibrational splittings .",
    "laser - based direct excitation of the weaker ( 4,0 ) and ( 5,0 ) overtone quadrupole bands was performed in the visible domain  @xcite .",
    "later investigations using cavity - ring down spectroscopy on the h@xmath15  ( 3,0 ) overtone band were carried out by robie  _ et al .",

    "@xcite performed precision measurements using cavity - ring down techniques for the fundamental band of d@xmath15 .",
    "the quadrupole excitations in the ground electronic state described above have very low transition probabilities .",
    "the ground state energy splittings can be determined indirectly from appropriate combinations of dipole - allowed transitions between ground state and excited electronic states .",
    "for example , the strongest molecular hydrogen transitions in lyman ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) and werner ( @xmath20@xmath19 ) bands have been used to derive ground state rovibrational constants . using this approach , stanke  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite derived accurate ground state molecular constants based largely on the experimental data of dabrowski  @xcite but also including quadrupolar transitions .",
    "the natural linewidths of transitions in the lyman and werner bands ultimately limit the accuracy that can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the rovibrational levels of the lowest - lying excited singlet gerade state @xmath21  of molecular hydrogen have longer natural lifetimes , even up to 150 ns @xcite , since one - photon transitions to the ground state are forbidden .",
    "the gerade states can be accessed from the ground state through two - photon spectroscopies , which also allow for more accurate level energy determinations .",
    "this first excited singlet gerade state in molecular hydrogen , the @xmath22 state , shown to correspond to a double - well potential  @xcite , has been investigated thoroughly over the years .",
    "eyler and coworkers performed a number of laser spectroscopic studies of increasing accuracy  @xcite .",

    "a continuous wave ( cw ) ti : sa laser serves as the injection - seed for the pulse generation , and is also used to lock the length of the oscillator cavity by a hnsch - couillaud scheme .",
    "the oscillator cavity is pumped with @xmath31 mj of 5-ns pulses of the 532-nm ( second - harmonic ) output from an injection - seeded nd : yag laser operating at 10-hz repetition rate . the resulting pulse from the oscillator cavity",
    "is further amplified in a 9-pass bowtie ti : sa amplifier pumped with @xmath32 mj of the same nd : yag pump laser .",
    "typical output pulse energies of the amplifier are approximately 45 mj at the fundamental wavelength of 844 nm .",

    "a 1-mm diameter pinhole is used as a spatial filter for the output of the ti : sa oscillator - amplifier system before the subsequent harmonic conversion .",
    "spatial filtering selects a smaller portion of the beam thereby reducing frequency chirp effects across the beam profile , which is crucial in subsequent frequency calibrations .",
    "the spatially - filtered pulsed output is frequency up - converted in two successive frequency - doubling stages ( using @xmath35-barium borate ( bbo ) crystals ) to yield fourth - harmonic uv radiation , with approximately 350 @xmath36j pulse energies at 211 nm .",
    "two - photon doppler - free techniques were combined with resonantly enhanced multi - photon ionization ( rempi ) in the spectroscopic experiment . in an isotropic gas sample ,",
    "two - photon absorption from two counter - propagating laser beams results in the cancellation of first - order doppler shifts .",
    "however , the application in a molecular beam with a defined unidirectional trajectory , results in residual first - order doppler shifts if there is a misalignment between the counter - propagating laser beams . to improve the laser beam alignment , an interferometric scheme is implemented  @xcite .",
    "the uv probe beam is split in two arms of equal intensity and arranged as part of a sagnac interferometer , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , with the interference fringes indicating the degree of alignment .",
    "narrow bandwidth uv radiation at 211 nm was used to probe the two - photon transitions in h@xmath15 , while hd and d@xmath15  measurements required 209 and 207 nm , respectively .",
    "a 355-nm laser pulse is used to further ionize the molecules excited in the @xmath21 , with the ionization laser delayed by 30 ns with respect to the probe laser .",
    "the h@xmath37 molecular ions are accelerated by electrostatic lenses and then traverse a field - free time - of - flight ( tof ) region .",
    "the ions impinge upon a multi - channel plate ( mcp ) detector attached to a phosphor screen , with the resulting fluorescence collected onto a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) , for signal registration .",
    "the preparation of vibrationally excited molecules in @xmath13  @xmath4 is achieved through electron bombardment of the molecular beam in a discharge source similar to that employed in ref .",
    "the discharge source is a ceramic pinhole nozzle with metallic electrodes ( depicted in the top left corner of fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) , attached to a pulsed solenoid valve ( general valve series 9 ) operated at 10-hz .",
    "the molecular beam pulse is discharged by applying a high voltage pulse to the cathode , with the discharge electrons moving upstream against the molecular beam trajectory .",
    "the anode is kept at the same potential as the valve orifice to avoid disturbing the valve operation .",
    "sufficient population of vibrationally excited molecules was achieved at a voltage of approximately -750 v applied to the cathode . to reduce ions produced in the same discharge from reaching the detection zone , a pair of deflection plates was installed near the end of the discharge nozzle .",
    "the vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen passes through a skimmer ( 2-mm diameter ) before entering the interaction zone where the uv spectroscopy takes place .",
    "the fundamental frequency @xmath38 is calibrated by referencing part of the light from the ti : sa cw - seed laser to a ( menlo systems m - comb femtosecond fiber ) frequency comb acting as an optical frequency ruler .",
    "the carrier - envelope phase offset frequency @xmath39 and repetition frequency @xmath40 of the frequency comb are locked to a local rubidium - clock that is referenced to the global positioning system . a heterodyne beat note @xmath41 is made between the cw - ti : sa laser and the frequency comb modes on an avalanche photodiode , which is counted electronically . in practice ,",
    "a number of frequency comb modes participate in the heterodyne process contributing to background noise .",
    "thus , the frequency comb spectrum is dispersed with a grating and subsequent spatial filtering of the unwanted modes is implemented to increase the signal - to - noise ratio in the @xmath41 measurement .",
    "the optical frequency of the uv laser system @xmath42 can be expressed as @xmath43 where the prefactor of 4 accounts for the harmonic order , and @xmath44 is mode number of the frequency comb component used .",
    "the cw - pulse frequency offset @xmath45 of the ti : sa system due to frequency chirp will be discussed below .",
    "the mode number determination follows from a coarse calibration of the laser using a burleigh wavemeter accurate to @xmath3330 mhz , which is sufficient for an unambiguous mode assignment since @xmath46 mhz .",
    "the sign of the respective frequency contributions to @xmath38 may be positive or negative but can be easily determined in practice .      in the frequency calibration procedure ,",
    "the ti : sa cw - seed optical frequency @xmath38 is determined , while the output of the oscillator - amplifier ti : sa _ pulsed _ laser system is actually used in the spectroscopy , after frequency upconversion to the 4@xmath47 harmonic .",
    "any frequency offset @xmath45 between the ti : sa cw - seed frequency and pulsed output frequency needs to be determined , where it is possible that the optical frequency is time - dependent within the laser pulse .",
    "the pulse generated in the ti : sa oscillator is subject to cavity - mode pulling effects , as a result of an optically - induced change in refractive index of the ti : sa crystal due to the intense 532-nm pump pulse , contributing to a frequency offset .",
    "the actual cavity resonance in the presence of the pump pulse is then frequency - shifted with respect to the locking point of the unpumped cavity .",
    "the frequency shift can be separated into contributions from a thermal change of the refractive index @xmath48 and an effect from the population inversion @xmath49 in the ti : sa crystal  @xcite .",
    "the total effective frequency offset , typically tens of mhz in the fundamental @xmath38 , can be compensated by controlling the lock setpoint of the ti : sa oscillator , e.g. locking at the side of the fringe in the hnsch - couillaud scheme .",
    "a related phenomenon is spatial frequency chirp where the pulsed optical frequency varies across the transverse beam profile of the laser beam .",
    "this effect occurs in the amplification stage , because subsequent passes sample a different area within the pump beam profile that has a gaussian intensity distribution .",
    "the spatial frequency difference from either edges of the beam profile was found to be a few mhz with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "to minimize such a spatial frequency offset , a 1-mm pinhole after the ti : sa amplifier acts as a spatial filter while still providing sufficient energy for the frequency upconversion process .",
    "the cw - pulse offset frequency @xmath45 is measured by heterodyning the amplified pulsed output of the ti : sa system with part of the cw - seed that is shifted by 250 mhz using an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "the resulting beat signal from a fast photo - detector is recorded with an oscilloscope for further frequency chirp analysis  @xcite .",
    "a single - shot frequency chirp analysis is performed for every ti : sa pulse in order to account for the frequency offset @xmath45 during each measurement point . a more detailed description of the frequency chirp measurements and analysis for the ti : sa pulsed laser system is given in refs .  @xcite .

    "the full - width half - maximum of the spectral lines is @xmath51 mhz and is well - approximated by a gaussian profile , limited by the instrumental linewidth of the uv laser source , and accounting for the two - photon excitation . as a test of robustness ,",
    "the obtained line positions were also checked when imposing different background levels .",
    "the uncertainty contribution is then estimated to be better than 500 khz for most scans of good signal - to - noise ratio . for more noisy spectra ,",
    "the line fitting uncertainty contribution is difficult to separate from statistical scatter , thus it is subsumed into the statistics entry .",
    "several measurements of a specific transition taken over several days , demonstrate reproducibility of within @xmath52 mhz in the transition frequency .",
    "an important systematic effect is the ac - stark frequency shift induced by the power density of the probe radiation .",
    "the use of a separate ionization laser , delayed with respect to the probe , allows for sufficient detection efficiency even at a reduced probe beam intensity , thereby minimizing the ac - stark shift .",
    "the ac - stark measurements are performed in two different beam configurations , referred to as ( i ) and ( ii ) . for most of the measurements ,",
    "the uv beam is collimated with a beam diameter of 0.5 mm , using a combination of concave mirrors , that also serves to reduce beam astigmatism .",
    "this configuration ( i ) is typical for low uv power density .",
    "an additional benefit of configuration ( i ) is that it reduces residual first - order doppler shifts compared to the case when using counter - propagating beams with curved wavefronts  @xcite . using ( i ) , a 355-nm laser pulse , delayed by 30 ns relative to the probe beam , was employed in order to ionize molecular hydrogen in the @xmath21  state . to aid in the ac - stark shift assessment and to improve the extrapolation to the field - free case , a second configuration is implemented , referred to as ( ii ) . in this configuration ,",

    "the horizontal axis represents the relative power density and is derived from a measurement of the probe beam intensity and a measurement of the beam diameter at the interaction region .",
    "it is worth noting that for the energy range between 30 and 300 @xmath36j in ( i ) , the ac - stark frequency shifts are within statistical scatter . the estimated error from the ac - stark effect is deduced from the error of the intercept determined in the weighted linear fit , with the extrapolated field - free frequency estimated to be accurate to @xmath55 mhz .",
