    "the theory of input - to - state stable ( iss ) systems plays a central role in modern non - linear control analysis and controller design ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the iss property was introduced by sontag in @xcite and an iss lyapunov characterization was obtained by sontag and wang in @xcite .",
    "the iss lyapunov characterization provides necessary and sufficient conditions for time - invariant systems to be iss , in terms of the existence of so - called strict iss lyapunov functions ; see section [ sec2 ] below for the relevant definitions and @xcite for an extension to time - varying systems .",
    "strict lyapunov functions have been used to design stabilizing feedback laws that render asymptotically controllable systems iss to actuator errors and small observation noise ; see @xcite .",
    "such control laws are expressed in terms of gradients of lyapunov functions and therefore require explicit strict lyapunov functions in order to be implemented .",
    "this has motivated a great deal of research devoted to constructing explicit strict lyapunov functions .",
    "one obstacle to these constructions is that the known strict lyapunov functions from the existence theory are optimal control value functions , involving a supremum of a cost criterion over infinitely many possible solution paths ( see @xcite ) , and therefore are not explicit .",
    "although value functions can often be expressed as unique solutions of hamilton - jacobi ( hj ) equations subject to appropriate side conditions , the usual techniques for computing value functions in terms of hj equation solutions can be difficult to implement .",
    "for certain special kinds of systems , strict iss lyapunov functions can be explicitly constructed by ad hoc means .",
    "on the other hand , there are numerous important cases where it is relatively straightforward to use backstepping or other known methods to construct explicit _",
    "non_-strict iss lyapunov functions ( see our definitions of iss and non - strict iss lyapunov functions in section [ sec2 ] and section [ sec5 ] for an explicit example ) . for instance , applying the methods of @xcite to tracking problems for nonholonomic systems in chained form results in non - strict lyapunov functions .",
    "the constructions in @xcite also frequently give rise to non - strict lyapunov functions .",
    "this motivates the search for techniques for constructing strict iss lyapunov functions for time - varying systems , in terms of known non - strict iss lyapunov functions .",
    "this search is the focus of this note . for time - varying systems with no controls ,",
    "the paper @xcite constructed strict globally asymptotically stable ( gas ) lyapunov functions in terms of given non - strict gas lyapunov functions . here",
    "we further develop the approach in @xcite .",
    "we provide the necessary background on iss systems and lyapunov functions in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "we then introduce a non - strict generalization of iss in which the dissipation rate depends on a non - negative time - dependent decay parameter .",
    "the parameter can be zero along intervals of positive length .",
    "however , when the parameter is identically one , our non - strict iss property agrees with the usual iss condition . under a mild non - degeneracy assumption on this parameter , which is of persistency of excitation type",
    "( see for instance @xcite and @xcite for definitions and discussions of the concept of persistency of excitation ) , we show that our non - strict iss property is equivalent to the existence of a strict iss lyapunov function and is therefore also equivalent to the standard iss condition .",
    "we prove these equivalences in section [ sec3 ] .",
