    "the precise relation of the main connectedness theorem of the present paper ( theorem [ con2 ] ) to the pierce - birkhoff conjecture , that is , the part of the program which is left for the subsequent papers , is explained in more detail later in this introduction . in the forthcoming paper @xcite , the next paper of the series",
