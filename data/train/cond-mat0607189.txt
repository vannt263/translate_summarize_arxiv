    "the renormalization group ( rg ) theory of critical phenomena classifies continuous phase transitions into so called universality classes , which are characterized by the dimension of the system , the range of the interaction and the symmetry of the order parameter ; see e.g. @xcite . at continuous phase transitions ,",
    "thermodynamic quantities follow power laws .",
    "e.g. the specific heat behaves as @xmath8 where @xmath5 is the critical exponent of the specific heat , @xmath9 the exponent of the leading correction to scaling , @xmath10,@xmath11,@xmath12 are amplitudes in the high and low temperature phase , respectively .",
    "the reduced temperature @xmath13 gives the distance from the critical temperature @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is the analytic background , which has to be taken into account when @xmath16 , as it is the case here . following the rg theory , critical exponents are universal , which means that they take exactly the same value for any system within a given universality class .",
    "most recent estimates are @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite . for reviews on theoretical and experimental results",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in addition to the critical exponents , amplitude ratios like @xmath19 and @xmath20 are universal , while the individual values of @xmath21,@xmath22,@xmath11 and @xmath12 depend on the microscopic details of the model .",
    "the three - dimensional xy universality class is of particular interest , since the @xmath23-transition of @xmath24he is supposed to share this universality class .",
    "the experimental study of this transition provides by far the most precise experimental results for universal quantities like critical exponents and amplitude ratios .",
    "thus this transition gives us an unique opportunity to test the ideas of the renormalization group and to benchmark theoretical methods .",
    "most recent experiments with @xmath24he were carried out during a spacelab mission @xcite .",
    "the condition of micro - gravity avoids the broadening of the transition due to the gravitational field and hence allows to access reduced temperatures down to @xmath25 .",
