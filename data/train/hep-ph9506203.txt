    "a precision measurement of the mass of the @xmath1 boson , @xmath0 , is one of the main objectives of the lep2 physics programme .",
    "there has already been considerable progress in the precision determination of @xmath0 from @xmath4 events at the tevatron @xmath5 collider @xcite , and the level of precision is expected to increase further in the coming years @xcite .",
    "it is important , therefore , that the potentiality of the @xmath0 measurements at lep2 should be exploited to the full .",
    "an obvious requirement for the success of these precise studies is a high level of reliability of the theoretical predictions for the various experimental observables relating to the different methods for measuring @xmath0 from the process @xmath6 .",
    "this in turn requires a detailed understanding of the physical phenomena which describe the production and decay of @xmath1 bosons at lep2 , in particular of the effects which arise from the large @xmath1 boson decay width @xmath7 ( @xmath8  gev ) @xcite .",
    "the instability of the @xmath1 bosons can , in principle , strongly modify the standard ` stable @xmath1 ' results .",
    "for example , an important role can be played by the qed and qcd radiative interferences ( both virtual and real ) which interconnect the production and decay stages .",
    "particular attention should be paid here to the virtual contributions corresponding to the ` charged ' particle poles for which , in contrast to the photon and gluon poles , there is no cancellation from real emissions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the level of suppression of the width - induced radiative effects depends on the ` degree of inclusiveness ' of the process .",
    "thus , in the case of the total inclusive cross section for @xmath9 , the final - state interaction effects are cancelled up to terms of relative order @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the only exception is the contribution arising from the coulomb interaction between the slowly moving @xmath1 bosons @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if the @xmath1 bosons were _ stable _ particles , the effect of the coulomb interaction on the total cross section has been known for a long time @xcite .",
    "the modifications to the coulomb corrections which arise from the _ instability _ of the @xmath1 bosons are particularly significant near the @xmath12 production threshold , @xmath13 , but become negligible for collision energies which satisfy @xmath14 . as explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath1-boson virtuality drastically changes the on - shell value of the coulomb correction even at @xmath15 , but after integration over the invariant masses of the two @xmath1 bosons the ` stable-@xmath1 ' result is restored far above the threshold region .",
    "the electroweak radiative corrections to the @xmath2 total cross section for the production of stable @xmath1 bosons are now known with high accuracy @xcite .",
    "the instability effects are well under control throughout the energy range accessible at lep2 ( @xmath16  gev ) .",
    "this includes the so - called ` colour - reconnection effects ' @xcite  non - perturbative hadronization dynamics which may affect the @xmath17 decay channel and which have recently attracted much attention .",
    "two different methods have been proposed for a precision measurement of @xmath0 at lep2 .",
    "the first uses the method of direct kinematic reconstruction of @xmath0 from the decay channels @xmath18 the second method uses the strong dependence of the total @xmath12 cross section on @xmath0 near threshold to translate a measurement of @xmath19 close to @xmath20 into a value of @xmath0 .",
    "both methods have been , and are currently being , studied in great detail , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "although both have their advantages and disadvantages , the direct reconstruction method is currently believed to provide the better precision on @xmath0 .",
    "since it naturally requires a higher collision energy to maximise the event rate , it does not conflict with the requirements of new particle / physics searches .    however , the direct reconstruction method is not without problems .",
    "for example , to construct the two @xmath1 s from the @xmath21 final state in ( [ fourq ] ) one must in principle attribute all observed hadrons to the ` correct ' parent @xmath1 , a procedure which is certainly affected by relatively unknown qcd interconnection corrections @xcite .",
    "since a complete description of these effects is not possible at present , one has to rely on model predictions rather than on exact calculations ; for details see refs .",
    "fortunately , the contribution of the interconnection effects to the systematic error on @xmath0 is not expected to significantly exceed the overall systematic error ( not including interconnection effects ) , which is currently estimated at @xmath22  mev .",
    "it is an open question whether bose - einstein effects might induce a further uncertainty in the mass determination @xcite .",
    "such problems do not of course arise for the semi - leptonic channel ( [ semilep ] ) , but there the event rate is smaller and an unobserved neutrino is present .",
    "the direct reconstruction method is based on measurements of semi - inclusive characteristics of the final state  @xmath1 boson momenta , jet  jet invariant masses , opening angle between jets , etc .",
    "all such quantities could well be much more sensitive to instability effects than the total cross section .",
    "for example , as could be anticipated from ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also below ) , the modification of the qed coulomb interaction could induce a systematic shift in the @xmath1 mass of @xmath23 , which is of the same order as the target precision .",
    "clearly such effects should be carefully calculated and taken into account in the extraction of the @xmath1 mass from measured distributions .",
    "note that since coulomb forces are responsible for the qed interaction between the separate hadronic or leptonic final states of each @xmath1 , their effects could be regarded as an example of ` qed interconnection effects ' .",
    "these effects are in fact quite universal and do not depend on the particular @xmath1 decay channels .    in the threshold region",
    "the coulomb contribution dominates the instability effects , and the coulomb terms can be uniquely separated from the remaining electroweak corrections . at higher energies , the width - induced modifications of the differential distributions caused by other radiative mechanisms ( for example , intermediate  final and final  final state radiative interferences @xcite ) may become just as important .",
    "moreover , it is argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the relativistic domain a cancellation may take place between the different sources of instability effects and that , as a result , the stable @xmath12 result may be restored . in the extreme relativistic limit , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath1 velocity , such a cancellation appears quite natural . and @xmath26 )",
    ", the width dependence disappears completely when the effects of emission at the production and decay stages are added coherently .",
    "the same behaviour is expected for qed radiation off fast - moving @xmath1 bosons @xcite .",
    "] however in the intermediate region @xmath27 , which is relevant for the lep2 energy range , the situation is less clear in our opinion , and therefore needs further detailed study . since @xmath28 at lep2 ,",
    "the non - relativistic coulomb formulae are likely to provide a reasonable qualitative guide to the size of the width - induced effects .    in this study",
    "we analyse the effect of the @xmath1 boson instability , as embodied in the first - order coulomb formulae of refs .",
    "@xcite , on the invariant mass distribution of the decay products .",
    "as far as we are aware , the necessity to take coulomb - induced distortion effects in the @xmath1 mass or momentum distribution into account was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to expose the direct effect of this ` qed interconnection ' , we make several simplifying assumptions in our analysis : ( i ) the effects of initial state radiation",
    "are not included , although it would be straightforward to take them into account using the standard techniques , ( ii ) we assume that the @xmath12 final state can be fully reconstructed , and ( iii ) we neglect possible qcd interconnection effects .",
    "note that our results also apply directly to the process @xmath29 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] we present a simple model calculation in which one of the @xmath1 bosons is assumed to be stable . above threshold",
    "this is expected to provide a reasonable qualitative understanding . using this model , we study the effect on the invariant mass distribution of the decaying @xmath1 of phase - space and first - order coulomb effects . in section  [ sec : quant ] we study numerically the realistic case when both @xmath1 bosons are off - mass - shell",
    ". predictions for the shift in the average mass with and without coulomb corrections are presented .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "to elucidate the physical origin of the distortion of the @xmath1 decay mass distribution induced by the coulomb interaction , it is instructive to consider first a simplified model in which one of the @xmath1 bosons is assumed to be stable and the other has the standard @xmath30 decay modes with decay width @xmath7 in @xmath31 , since in most models @xmath32 .",
    "the observation of such a process would be a signature of an exotic higgs sector , see for example ref .",
    "( see also @xcite ) .    in the non - relativistic region the differential distribution of the invariant mass - squared @xmath33 of the unstable @xmath1",
    "can be written as @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the @xmath6 off - shell born cross section @xcite at centre - of - mass energy @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the breit - wigner factor final state under consideration . ] @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath40 is the ` hard ' first - order radiative correction , @xmath41 is the first - order coulomb contribution ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and @xmath25 is the velocity of the @xmath1 bosons in the centre - of - mass frame . in the non - relativistic approximation @xmath42 where @xmath43 in our model calculation it will be sufficient to work in the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that in this case @xmath44 is given by the same formulae as in the realistic case of two unstable @xmath1 bosons @xcite , with @xmath7 replaced by @xmath45 .",
    "thus @xmath46 with @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the non - relativistic energy of the @xmath1 bosons , @xmath49 recall that as a direct consequence of the dominance of @xmath50-wave @xmath12 production at @xmath51,exchange contribution , which dominates the @xmath6 threshold cross section , is not suppressed by a particular choice of @xmath52 beam polarizations .",
    "the mass distortion effects discussed here are strictly only valid for _ unpolarized _ scattering . ]",
    "@xmath53 it is worth mentioning that the higher - order terms in the expansion ( [ swave ] ) lead to a net negative correction to the leading @xmath54 behaviour , see for example fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite , which originates in the high - energy su(2)@xmath55u(1 ) gauge invariance cancellation .    for @xmath56 and in the dominant ( ` peak ' ) region specified by @xmath57 ,",
    "one finds @xmath58 eq .",
    "( [ peakapprox ] ) reveals the strong dependence of the coefficient @xmath44 on the @xmath1 boson virtuality @xmath33 .",
    "this follows from the general nature of the coulomb forces between unstable heavy particles @xcite .",
    "thus in the large invariant mass tail ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath44 is strongly suppressed , while in the small invariant mass tail ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 , i.e. twice the first - order on - mass - shell value .",
    "after integration over @xmath33 , the arctan modification of @xmath44 averages to zero and the stable @xmath1 result obtains .",
    "note that while for the total @xmath2 cross section the stable @xmath1 result for the coulomb correction is only strongly modified by instability effects in the narrow energy region @xmath62 ( i.e. close to threshold ) , for the invariant mass distribution the arctan modification of @xmath44 is essentially independent of energy for @xmath63 .",
    "however , far above threshold additional energy dependence _",
    "will _ appear due to the screening role of the other qed final - state interaction mechanisms .    for purposes of illustration , it is convenient to rewrite the cross section formula ( [ dsig ] ) for @xmath64 in the dominant @xmath33 ( peak ) region in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath65 where @xmath66 the differential cross section in eq .",
    "( [ dsig ] ) then becomes @xmath67,\\ ] ] with @xmath68 the invariant mass distribution @xmath69 deviates from the breit - wigner @xmath70 form , corresponding to an individual @xmath1 decay , because of ( i ) the strong dependence of the threshold born cross section @xmath71 on the @xmath1 momentum , and ( ii ) the characteristic behaviour of the coulomb term discussed above . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath51 , which corresponds to @xmath72 , the invariant mass distribution is strongly suppressed by phase space effects , eq .",
    "( [ swave ] ) .",
    "these lead to a decrease in the average value of the invariant mass , @xmath73 , in the threshold region by ' denotes a shift in the average mass due to the born cross section behaviour . ]",
    "@xmath74 with increasing @xmath25 the negative higher - order ( in @xmath75 ) terms in the expansion ( [ swave ] ) become more and more important and , as a result , @xmath76 changes sign ( see section  [ sec : quant ] below ) .",
    "the characteristic dependence on the @xmath1 virtuality of the coulomb correction for @xmath56 always causes a decrease in the average mass compared to the born prediction : @xmath77 note that this mainly arises from the coulomb - induced asymmetry in the tails of the distribution , as discussed above .",
    "the shift in the actual position of the peak is numerically rather small .",
    "it is important to emphasize the difference between the predictions of eqs.([omega],[peakapprox ] ) and the ` on - mass - shell coulomb ' correction , @xmath78 .",
    "the latter would induce a shift in the @xmath33 distribution towards larger values , throughout the threshold region .",
    "note that there appears to be a range of collider energies around @xmath79  gev where the phase space and coulomb induced distortions are of the same order in their effect on the average mass ( see figs .  3 and 4 below ) .",
    "however at this energy , which is of practical importance for lep2 , other mechanisms ( e.g. intermediate  final and final  final radiative interference involving the decay products of the two @xmath1 bosons ) have to be taken into account .    finally , higher - order ( @xmath80 ) coulomb effects could be numerically more important for the invariant mass distribution than for the total cross section . in principle , it is straightforward to take these into account using the general formalism presented in ref .  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the qualitative effects on the invariant mass distribution of phase - space and coulomb corrections using a simple model in which only one @xmath1 boson is off - mass - shell . in the following section",
    ", we shall study numerically the more realistic case of _ both _",
    "@xmath1 bosons being off - shell .",
    "as we shall see , the conclusions obtained from our model are unchanged by the more complete analysis .",

    "\\label{relforms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that we have omitted the ` hard ' radiative corrections and used the ` relativistic ' forms for @xmath84 and @xmath48 .",
    "in what follows we will use eqs .",
    "( [ sigcoul],[relforms ] ) to study ( i ) the invariant mass distribution @xmath85 and ( ii ) the average invariant mass @xmath86 ( which has certain practical advantages as an estimator of @xmath0 @xcite ) defined by @xmath87.\\ ] ]    figure  1 shows the normalized distribution @xmath88 ( the @xmath1 ` line shape ' ) as a function of @xmath89 , at three different collider energies , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92  gev .",
    "gev / c@xmath93 @xcite and @xmath94  gev in our numerical calculations .",
    "all other parameters coincide with those used in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see table  1 therein ) . ] also shown , for comparison , is the ` pure breit - wigner ' form @xmath95 which corresponds , formally , to the @xmath96 limit . as anticipated in the previous section ,",
    "the phase space effects give a significant distortion to the distribution , especially close to the @xmath12 threshold .",
    "in particular , the distribution is strongly suppressed for @xmath97 .",
    "the distributions in fig .  1 include the first - order coulomb correction @xmath44 .",
    "to see the effect of this , we show in fig .  2 the ratio @xmath98 at @xmath99  gev with and without the coulomb correction .",
    "again we confirm the qualitative behaviour obtained in the model analysis of the previous section : the coulomb contribution enhances ( suppresses ) the small ( large ) mass tail .",
    "note , however , that the effect is numerically much less significant at this energy than the distortion due to phase space effects , which forces @xmath100 to be very small for @xmath101  gev .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath1 mass using the diect reconstruction method at lep2 involves fitting a measured invariant mass distribution , like that of fig .  1 , by a theoretical distribution",
    "( in practice implemented in a monte carlo program ) in which @xmath0 is a free parameter . in this way ,",
    "measured quantities like the position of the peak or the average invariant mass , both of which are crude measures of @xmath0 , are corrected to the ` true ' value .",
    "it should be clear from the above discussion that fitting the measured distribution with a theoretical expression which does _ not _ include the final - state interaction effects will induce an error in the mass measurement . to quantify this , we focus our attention on the difference between the average @xmath1 mass @xmath86 ( [ average ] ) defined by the @xmath33 distribution and the input mass @xmath0 , @xmath102 .",
    "as in the previous section , @xmath103 denotes the mass shift using the born ( off - mass - shell ) cross section and @xmath104 denotes the _ additional _ mass shift from including the @xmath105 coulomb correction .",
    "figure  3 shows @xmath103 as a function of the collider energy @xmath36 .",
    "the behaviour can be understood from fig .  1 , and is exactly as anticipated in section  [ sec : model ] . near and below threshold , there is a strong phase space suppression for masses @xmath106 , and so @xmath107 . above threshold",
    ", the mass difference grows with increasing collider energy as more and more phase space for large invariant masses opens up .",
    "a problem with this calculation of @xmath108 is that the integrals over @xmath33 and @xmath109 receive contribution from arbitrarily small and large invariant masses ( subject only to @xmath110 ) . in practice ,",
    "events with very large or very small @xmath111 invariant masses would not be classified as @xmath1 decay events .",
    "in particular , lower cuts on the @xmath112 are required to eliminate non@xmath12 backgrounds . to make a more realistic calculation , therefore , we impose an additional cut , @xmath113 note that this cutting procedure will to some extent complicate the calculation of the qed and qcd final - state radiative corrections , because of the reduction of the phase - space for final - state emission .",
    "the mass shifts @xmath103 for @xmath114  gev and 10  gev are shown as the dashed and dash - dotted curves respectively in fig .",
    "3 . with this additional mass cut",
    "there is less dependence on @xmath36 , since @xmath115 as @xmath116 at fixed @xmath36 .",
    "note also that asymptotic values of @xmath117  gev are approached for @xmath118  gev , as @xmath119 . weighted by @xmath95 over the range of integration given in eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) . ]",
    "figure  4 shows the additional mass shift @xmath104 due to the coulomb correction .",
    "here we see that as long as the mass cut @xmath120 is not particularly tight , the shift for @xmath121  gev is rather constant at @xmath122  mev .",
    "this is consistent with the model calculation of section  [ sec : model ] , which predicted a constant negative shift of order @xmath123 for @xmath56 . as can be derived from eqs .",
    "( [ sigcoul],[average ] ) , @xmath104 changes sign at lower energies and attains a maximum at threshold ( @xmath124 ) , where the average @xmath1 momentum is lower , @xmath125 .",
    "the actual maximum value depends on the cut parameter @xmath120 .",
    "note once again that the mass shift decreases at fixed @xmath36 as the invariant mass cut is tightened , i.e. @xmath126 as @xmath127 .",
    "the success of the precision measurements of the @xmath1 boson relies on an accurate theoretical knowledge of the details of the production and decay mechanisms .",
    "the favoured ` direct reconstruction ' method of measuring @xmath0 at lep2 using the hadronic ( @xmath128 ) channel has an important caveat  the colour reconnection effects induced by the strong final - state interaction may obscure the separate identities of the @xmath1 bosons and thus distort the mass determination @xcite . at the moment , these effects are not completely curable theoretically because of the lack of deep understanding of non - perturbative qcd dynamics .    however , there are other effects  originating in purely qed radiative phenomena  which , in principle , prevent the final state being treated as two separate @xmath1 decays . in this paper",
    "we have studied one example of this , the coulomb interaction between two unstable @xmath1 bosons which induces non - factorizable corrections to the final - state mass distributions .",
    "of course there is no reason why all such effects can not , in principle , be computed to arbitrary accuracy in qed perturbation theory , and taken into account in the mass determination . in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated explicitly that their emission could lead to a @xmath129 shift in the measured mass .",
    "bosons of a new light scalar with a sufficiently large coupling . ]",
    "this shift can only be reduced by imposing a rather tight invariant mass cut , which selects only those events near the peak if the distribution where the distortion is minimized . in particular , we have investigated the effect on the mass distribution of the qed interconnection effects generated by the first - order coulomb corrections in the threshold region at lep2 . at the highest lep2 energies , it is likely that we are overestimating the mass distortion effect ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this region , therefore , our results should be regarded as only a starting point for futher , more detailed studies .",
    "particularly important in this respect are the qed interactions involving the decay products of the two @xmath1 bosons , which become essential in the relativistic region .    finally , we note that similar non - factorizable qed final - state interaction effects could also be important in precision @xmath0 measurements at the tevatron @xmath5 collider , for example in the process @xmath130 .",
    "the distortion would then be manifest , for example , in the transverse momentum distribution of the final - state lepton .",
