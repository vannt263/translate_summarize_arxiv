    "the discovery of quantum error - correcting codes and the theory of fault - tolerant quantum computation have greatly improved the long - term prospects for quantum computing technology @xcite . to implement fault - tolerant quantum computation for a given quantum error - correcting code , protocols for performing fault - tolerant operations are needed .",
    "the basic design principle of a fault - tolerant operation protocol is that if only one component in the procedure fails , then the failure causes at most one error in each encoded block of qubits output from the procedure .",
    "the most straightforward protocol is to use transversal gates whenever possible .",
    "a transversal operation has the virtue that an error occurring on the @xmath5th qubit in a block can only ever propagate to the @xmath5th qubit of other blocks of the code , no matter what other sequence of gates we perform before a complete error - correction procedure @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is widely believed in the quantum information science community that there does not exist a quantum error correcting code , upon which we can perform universal quantum computations using just transversal gates @xcite , and recently this belief is proved @xcite .",
    "we therefore have to resort to other techniques , for instance quantum teleportation @xcite or state distillation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 hierarchy is introduced by gottesman and chuang to implement fault - tolerant quantum computation via teleportation @xcite .",
    "the starting point is , if we can perform the pauli operations and measurements fault - tolerantly , we can then perform all clifford group operations fault - tolerantly by teleportation .",
    "we can then use a similar technique to boot - strap the way to universal fault - tolerant computation , using teleportation , which gives a @xmath0 hierarchy of quantum teleportation , as defined below :    the sets @xmath0 are defined in a recursive way as sets of unitary operations @xmath6 that satisfy : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the pauli group .",
    "we call a unitary operation an @xmath1-qubit @xmath0 gate if it belongs to the set @xmath0 and acts nontrivially on at most @xmath1 qubits",
    ".    note by definition @xmath9 is the clifford group , which takes the pauli group into itself . and",
    "@xmath10 , but @xmath0 for @xmath11 is no longer a group .     denotes an * epr * pair",
    ", @xmath12 represents bell - basis measurement , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a pauli operator .",
    "the double wires carry classical bits and single wire carries qubits .",
    "any gate in the @xmath0 hierarchy can be implemented fault - tolerantly using this teleporation scheme.,width=288 ]    -teleportation , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a cnot gate with the first qubit as its target . for @xmath19-teleportation ,",

    "[ 2bit ] ) in a fault - tolerant manner . because , as proved in @xcite , it is possible to fault - tolerantly prepare the ancilla state @xmath23 , apply the classically controlled correction operation @xmath24 , and measure in bell basis on a stabilizer code .",
    "however the precise set of gates which form @xmath0 is unknown , even for a fixed number of qubits .",
    "it is demonstrated in @xcite that a subset of @xmath0 gates could be implemented by a different architecture than the standard teleportation , called one - bit teleportation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 1bit ] . those gates",
    "adopt the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a diagonal gate in @xmath0 and @xmath27 are two clifford operations .",
    "gates of this form are recently studied in literature and are called the semi - clifford operations @xcite . in the following we will denote the @xmath1-qubit pauli group as @xmath28 and a semi - clifford operation is defined to be a gate which sends at least one maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath28 to another maximal abelian one under conjugation .    due to the fact that one - bit teleportation needs only half the number of ancilla qubits per teleportation than the standard two - bit teleportation , it is important to understand the difference of capabilities between one and two - bit teleportation for the practical implementations of fault - tolerant architecture .",
    "it is conjectured in @xcite that those two capabilities coincide for @xmath29 , which means that all the @xmath30 gates for two qubits are semi - clifford operations .    in this paper",
    ", we prove this conjecture for a more general situation where @xmath31 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we then disprove it for parameters @xmath4 by explicit construction of counterexamples .",
    "we leave open the question for the parameters @xmath32 , and a more general problem of fully characterizing the structure of @xmath0 : we conjecture that all gates in @xmath0 are something we refer to as generalized semi - clifford operations , i.e. a natural generalization of the concept of semi - clifford operation to the case including classical permutations .",
    "our results about this semi - clifford operations versus @xmath0 gates relation can be visualized in fig .",

    "it is then natural to ask the questions , how to characterize this concept of gate complexity with concrete physical quantities , how does this measure based on teleportation schemes compare with the usual circuit depth , and what it implies for the practical construction of quantum computation architecture . to answer these questions ,",
    "we introduce a quantity as a measure of gate complexity for fault - tolerant quantum computation based on the @xmath0 hierarchy , called the teleportation depth , which characterizes how many teleportation steps are necessary , on average , to implement a given gate .",
    "we demonstrate the effect of the existence of non semi - clifford operations in @xmath0 on the estimation of the upper bound for the teleportation depth , as well as some quantitative difference between the capabilities of one and two - bit teleportation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii gives definition and basic properties of semi - clifford operations and generalized semi - clifford operations ; in section iii we study the structure of @xmath0 hierarchy in terms of semi - clifford and generalized semi - clifford operations ; section iv is devoted to the discussion of teleportation depth and how it depends on the structure of @xmath0 ; and with section v , we conclude our paper .",
    "the concept of semi - clifford operations was first introduced in @xcite , to characterize the property of gates transforming pauli matrices acting on a single qubit . here",
    "we generalize it to the @xmath1-qubit case , through the following definition .",
    "an @xmath1-qubit unitary operation is called semi - clifford if it sends by conjugation at least one maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath28 to another maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath28 .    that is ,",
    "if @xmath6 is an @xmath1-qubit semi - clifford operation , then there must exist at least one maximal abelian subgroup @xmath35 of @xmath28 , such that @xmath36 is another maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath28 .",
    "the most basic property of a semi - clifford operation is ,    if @xmath37 is a semi - clifford operation , then there exist clifford operations @xmath27 such that @xmath38 is diagonal .    * proof * : @xmath39 represents the pauli @xmath40 operation on the @xmath41 qubit .",
    "if @xmath37 is an @xmath1-qubit semi - clifford operation , then there must exist @xmath1-qubit operations @xmath42 such that @xmath43 , @xcite , i.e. @xmath44 holds for any @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 , i.e. the @xmath1-qubit gate @xmath38 is diagonal.@xmath47    in other words , semi - clifford operations are those gates diagonalizable ` up to clifford multiplications ' .",
    "thus the structure problem of the whole set of semi - clifford operations is reduced to that of the diagonal subset within it .    as we shall see later ,",
    "the notion of semi - clifford operations is useful in characterizing some but not all gates in the @xmath0 hierarchy .",
    "more generally , we might also consider those gates with properties of transforming the span , or in other words the group algebra over the complex field , of a maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath28 .",
    "a generalized semi - clifford operation on @xmath1 qubits is defined to send by conjugation the span of at least one maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath28 to the span of another maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath28",
    ".    denote @xmath48 the group generated by a set of operators @xmath49 , and denote the span of the group @xmath48 as @xmath50 . then in a more mathmatical form we can write the above definition as :    if @xmath6 is a generalized semi - clifford operation on @xmath1 qubits , then there must exist at least one maximal abelian subgroup @xmath51 of @xmath28 , such that for all @xmath52 , @xmath53 , where @xmath36 is another maximal abelian subgroup of @xmath28 .",
    "then the basic property of a generalized semi - clifford operation is ,    if @xmath37 is a generalized semi - clifford operation , then there exist clifford operations @xmath27 , and a classical permutation operator @xmath54 such that @xmath55 is diagonal .    * proof *",

    "in this section we study the structure of gates in @xmath0 . to begin with , we study some basic properties of @xmath0 gates . then we give our main results as structure theorems , which state that all the @xmath0 gates are semi - clifford when @xmath31 and @xmath3 , but for @xmath4 there are examples of @xmath0 gates which are non - semi - clifford .",
    "we then discuss the open question for the parameters @xmath32 , and based on the constructed counterexamples we conjecture that all @xmath0 gates are generalized semi - clifford operations .",
    "it should be noted that the set of @xmath1-qubit @xmath0 gates is always strictly contained in the set of @xmath1-qubit @xmath60 gates . in @xcite ,",
    "explicit examples are given to support this statement .",
    "if we denote as @xmath61 the @xmath1-qubit gate which applies @xmath6 to the @xmath1th qubit only if the first @xmath62 qubits are all in the state @xmath63 , then @xmath64 is in @xmath65 .",
    "we first state an important property of gates in @xmath0 , which reduce the problem of characterizing the structure of @xmath0 into a problem of characterizing a certain subset of gates in @xmath0 .    if @xmath66 , then @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",

    "the fact that @xmath164 does not contain a maximally abelian subgroup of @xmath127 implies that @xmath132 is not semi - clifford , due to proposition 5 .",

    "teleportation , as a computational primitive , is a crucial element providing universal quantum computation to fault - tolerant schemes based on stabilizer codes .",

    "it is useful to know which gates are easier to implement and which are harder , so that we could achieve optimal efficiency in performing a computational task . in the circuit model of quantum computation",
    ", we face the same problem and in that case ` circuit depth ' was introduced @xcite to characterize the number of simple one and two - qubit gates needed to implement an operation .",

    "based on the @xmath0 hierarchy introduced in @xcite and the knowledge of its structure gained in previous section , we define a measure of gate complexity for the teleportation protocol , called the teleportation depth , which characterizes how many teleportation steps are necessary , on average , to implement a given gate .",
    "since any teleportation unavoidably causes randomness , we need to figure out a certain point to start with , i.e. we should assume in advance that some kind of gates can be performed fault - tolerantly .",
    "we know that a fault - tolerant protocol is usually associated with some quantum error - correcting codes .",

    ", we only need to teleport the gate outside the clifford group , and in the following , we will assume this as a starting point .",
    "the advantage of doing this , in practice , is that due to proposition 1 , we have the freedom of preparing the ancilla states up to some clifford multiplications .      with the standard two - bit teleportation scheme ( fig .",
