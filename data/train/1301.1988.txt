    "magnetic heusler compounds with the general formula x@xmath0yz where x and y are transition metal elements and z is a main group element are one of the most fascinating classes of modern magnetic materials , from both a fundamental as well as an application - oriented point of view  @xcite . the large variety of physical properties which can be realized in heusler - type materials is a consequence of their peculiar crystal structure and their great chemical flexibility . the basic cubic @xmath2 crystal structure of x@xmath3yz phases ( space group @xmath4 ) is composed of four interpenetrating fcc sublattices ( see fig.[fig : heusler_inv_heusler ] ) .",
    "it may be considered as a zincblende - like arrangement of z and x atoms with the remaining x atoms in the tetrahedral and the y atoms in the octahedral voids .",
    "this leads to a nacl - type arrangement of the y and z atoms where each y atom is surrounded by six z atoms in the second coordination sphere , whereas the nearest neighbors of each y atom are eight x atoms . on the other hand ,",
    "each x atom is surrounded by four y and four z atoms .",
    "an early contribution to the rationalization of the magnetic properties of heusler compounds is the theoretical work by kbler et al . on x@xmath3mnz - type compounds  @xcite , which describes how large localized magnetic moments in the mn sublattice are realized by an itinerant electronic system composed of hybridized mn  d - x  d bands  @xcite .",
    "kbler et al . emphasized the importance of indirect mn - z - mn interactions for the magnetic properties .",
    "the various magneto - responsive effects of heusler compounds such as magnetic - field - induced shape memory / strain effects , magnetoresistance , and magnetocaloric effects  @xcite promise a wide range of applications .",
    "for instance , ferromagnetic martensites are experimentally found in different half - heusler alloys such as nimnga , nifega , coniga and related materials  @xcite .",
    "all these effects occur in temperature ranges which are convenient for device operation .",
    "the great current interest in heusler compounds arises , however , at least partly from the observation of half - metallic ferromagnetism in several of these materials  @xcite as half - metallic ferromagnets have a great potential in the emerging field of spintronic applications  @xcite . since wurmehl _",
    "et  al . _",
    "have reported an exceptionally high magnetic moment of 6  @xmath5 and a curie temperature @xmath6 of 1100  k for the half - metallic co@xmath0fesi  @xcite , the interest for heusler compounds has highly increased , and the co - based heusler compounds have been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "the combination of co and fe is particularly good for obtaining high @xmath6 s . + not only the cubic but also tetragonally distorted heusler compounds like",
    "mn@xmath7ga  @xcite have found considerable attention as they are attractive candidates for spin - transfer - torque applications  @xcite . in this respect",
    "it is remarkable that in course of a recent theoretical study on potentially new heusler compounds  @xcite several iron - based fe@xmath3yz materials with a regular tetragonal heusler structure have been predicted  @xcite .",
    "actually it was found for these phases that the inverse cubic heusler structure ( x - structure , space group @xmath8 ) , should be more stable than the regular one ( see fig.[fig : heusler_inv_heusler ] ) .",
    "the x - structure may be formally written as ( fey)fez where the fe atoms occupy the octahedral and tetrahedral voids of the zincblende - type lattice to equal parts .",
    "the inverse fe@xmath3yz structures in some of the materials are , however , predicted to be unstable towards a tetragonal distortion which tends to maximize the bonding interactions  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the potential importance of tetragonal iron - based heusler compounds for applications , especially as potential rare - earth free hard magnets , and by the fundamental question of electronic instabilities in heusler compounds this work reports the synthesis and characterization of the new compounds fe@xmath3nige , fe@xmath3cuga , and fe@xmath3cual , the existence of which has been predicted in ref  @xcite .",
    "in addition the properties of the known phases fe@xmath3coge  @xcite and fe@xmath3niga  @xcite have been investigated in more detail .",
    "usually first - principle electronic structure calculations are based on a perfect crystal",
    ". however , heusler compounds are ternary or even quaternary compounds which are widely amenable to chemical disorder .",
    "this can be the reason for discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results .",
    "this aspect turns out to be of crucial importance also for the present fe@xmath3yz materials and therefore will be discussed in detail .",
    "as x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) techniques are frequently insufficient for extracting the detailed atomic order in heusler materials additional experimental methods are required .",
    "anomalous xrd and extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) experiments are versatile techniques for this purpose  @xcite , while x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) studies give access to site - selective magnetic moments  @xcite . in case of the present iron - based materials",
    "we have used @xmath1fe - mssbauer spectroscopy as a simple laboratory - technique to characterize both the local atomic and magnetic order in our samples . the additional theoretical analysis based on first - principles electronic structure calculations treating the chemical disorder by means of the cpa method  @xcite(coherent potential approximation ) , shows that the cubic structure of fe@xmath3yz heusler materials becomes indeed more stable when assuming certain degree of anti - site disorder as suggested by the experiments .",
    "fe@xmath0yz ( y = co , ni , cu ; z = al , ga , ge ) compounds were synthesized by repeated arc - melting or ball milling of stoichiometric amounts of pure metals in an argon atmosphere under @xmath9  mbar pressure . to ensure an oxygen - free atmosphere ,",
    "titanium was used as getter material .",
    "the samples were three times melted and turned over .",
    "the weight loss after the whole process was less than 0.5% .",
    "additionally , they were annealed in evacuated glass quartz tubes for two weeks at 673  k and then in order to test the influence of the annealing temperature on the degree of disorder some of them were further annealed at 1173  k. after annealing they were quenched in a mixture of ice and water .",
    "in addition it has been attempted to synthesize fe@xmath3znal in a similar way , however , the heusler phase could not be stabilized .",
    "the crystal structures of the products at room temperature were investigated by means of powder xrd using excitation by monochromatic cu - k@xmath10 ( @xmath11=1.540598   ) or mo - k@xmath12 radiation ( @xmath13=0.7093165   ) in @xmath14-@xmath14 scanning mode .",
    "disc - shaped samples were used for fe@xmath0coge , fe@xmath0niga , fe@xmath0cuga and fe@xmath0cual . since",
    "fe@xmath0nige samples were better produced by ball - milling , they were measured as powders .",
    "the xrd patterns were fitted by the fullprof software package  @xcite , in case of mo - k@xmath12 radiation the @xmath15/@xmath16 splitting of the radiation was taken into account .",
    "the magnetization was measured by different squid magnetometers ( mpms - xl5 and mpms squid vsm , quantum design ) within the temperature range 1.8 to 950  k. @xmath1fe - mssbauer measurements were performed in transmission , backscattering and cems ( conversion electron mssbauer spectroscopy ) modes using a constant acceleration spectrometer with a @xmath1co  ( rh - matrix ) source with @xmath17  kev .",
    "the backscattering spectra were recorded with the miniaturized mssbauer spectrometer mimos  @xcite .",
    "information about bulk properties was obtained from the transmission or backscattering spectra ( information depth d  @xmath18   ) , while the cem spectra ( d  @xmath19   ) is more surface sensitive . to obtain the reliable distribution of hyperfine parameters",
    "the data were fitted using the voigt - based fitting ( vbf ) model within the recoil software package  @xcite .",
    "+ the homogeneity and stoichiometry of the samples was controlled by a scanning electron microscope ( sem , jeol  jsm-6400 ) equipped with an energy - dispersive x - ray ( edx ) spectroscopy detection system ( eumex  edx ) .",
    "the measurements were carried out at @xmath20  mbar pressure .",
    "the acceleration voltage of 20  kv with inspection angle of 35@xmath21 was used . for the correction of the quantitative data",
    "the so - called zaf method was applied , which relies on atomic number ( z ) , and on absorption ( a ) and fluorescence ( f ) effects .",
    "the images were acquired via the digital image processing system ( dips ) and the quantitative chemical analysis was performed with the wineds  4.0 program . according to the edx analysis the fe@xmath0yz alloys show a rather good homogeneity in their composition , except fe@xmath0nige ( see tab .  [ tab_edx ] ) .",
    ".relative concentration given as percentages of the samples from the fe@xmath0yz alloys according to an edx analysis .",
    "[ tab_edx ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_moessbauer ]    the values of the mssbauer parameters of fe@xmath0yz obtained from the data evaluation for bulk samples are summarized in table  [ tab_moessbauer ] .",
    "all spectra can be described by two or three hyperfine sextets which show that the corresponding materials are magnetically ordered at room temperature .",
    "the detailed spectral shapes differ , however , which suggests a varying degree of disorder within the series of compounds .",
    "the mssbauer spectra and @xmath22 values of fe@xmath3coge are close to those of co@xmath23fe@xmath24si",
    "@xcite with two well - defined sextets .",
    "thus , the sextet with higher @xmath22 is assigned to fe(@xmath25 ) sites and the second sextet with lower @xmath22 value to the fe(@xmath26 ) sites .",
    "the intensity ratio of the two sextets is approximately 1:1 .",
    "these data evidence that fe@xmath3coge crystallizes in the inverse heusler ( x ) structure like fe@xmath3cosi .",
    "mssbauer spectra not only give information about the atomic distribution over the crystallographic sites but also allow an estimation of the ordered magnetic moments for fe atoms at the a and b sites , respectively . in cubic or nearly cubic compounds the internal magnetic hyperfine field is determined by the fermi contact term , which arises from the polarization of the s - electron density at the nucleus .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath22 scales linearly with the magnetic moments determined from neutron or magnetization studies  @xcite .",
    "taking a slope of 125  koe/@xmath5 for fe germanides from ref .",
    "one roughly estimates the magnetic moments as @xmath27 and @xmath28 for fe(a ) and fe(b ) atoms in fe@xmath3coge , respectively . considering the total magnetic moment of 5.4  @xmath5 from the magnetization studies ( at 5",
    "k ) the remaining co moment must be about 1.1  @xmath5 in case of ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "these estimates are in fair agreement with the calculated moments of 2.7  @xmath5 and 1.4  @xmath5 for the fe sites and 0.9  @xmath5 for the co sites reported in ref .  .",
    "as for all the present materials the curie temperatures are above 700 k the estimates of the moments from the room temperature mssbauer spectra can be used for comparison with theoretical results . these data are included in table iii .",
    "quite similar spectra are observed for fe@xmath3nige .",
    "accordingly , also fe@xmath3nige essentially crystallizes in the inverse heusler structure but line broadening for both subspectra and the small deviation from the ideal intensity ratio of 1:1 indicate some disorder . in case of fe@xmath3nige , from the @xmath22 values ( see table  [ tab_moessbauer ] ) one estimates the magnetic moments as 2.5  @xmath5 and 1.7  @xmath5 for the fe(a ) and fe(b ) atoms , respectively .",
    "the sum of the moments nearly corresponds to the total magnetic moment of 4.3  @xmath5 for fe@xmath3nige obtained from magnetometry , which suggests that the ni sites do not contribute much to the magnetic ordering .",
    "it is noted , however , that the present material is not completely single - phase .",
    "the mssbauer spectrum reveals a 6% contribution of a paramagnetic quadrupole doublet ( @xmath29 = 0.23 mm / s , @xmath30 = 0.37 mm / s ) . in agreement with the clues from the xrd patterns this signal",
    "is assigned to an fe@xmath31ge@xmath32 impurity as the magnetic behavior of this system is known to depend strongly on the fe - ge ratio@xcite .",
    "+ in contrast to fe@xmath3coge and fe@xmath3nige the mssbauer spectrum of fe@xmath3niga reveals enhanced disorder .",
    "the two subspectra are no longer resolved and the spectra were modeled by a superposition of two broad sextets the average @xmath22 values of which are only slightly different .",
    "hence , the distinction between well defined a and b sites is not meaningful .",
    "the disorder in fe@xmath3niga leads to a pronounced distribution of hyperfine fields and of the corresponding magnetic moments over various sites with differing local coordination environment .",
    "the nearly structureless spectra may point towards an a2-type disorder where alloying occurs between all sites .",
    "the average @xmath22 of 255  koe roughly corresponds to an ordered moment of 2  @xmath5 per fe or 4  @xmath5 per formula unit which is close to the total moment of about 4.2  @xmath5 . the considerable disorder in fe@xmath3niga is also suggested by the xrd pattern which reveals a pronounced broadening of the ( 400 ) and ( 422 ) reflections .",
    "additional information about the orientation of the magnetic moments can be derived from the intensities of the fe@xmath3niga spectrum .",
    "as it is well known  @xcite for @xmath1fe , in case of no or small quadrupole interaction only 6 lines of the 8 possible transitions in a magnetic field are observed with the intensity ratio @xmath33 . the @xmath34 value is characteristic for the relative intensity of the @xmath35@xmath36  @xmath37  @xmath38 transitions and depends on the angle @xmath14 between the propagation vector of the @xmath39-radiation and the direction of @xmath22 : @xmath40 . for a random orientation ( powder ) and",
    "thin absorbers @xmath34 = 2 , whereas z = 4 for @xmath14 = 90@xmath41 and z = 0 for @xmath14 = 0@xmath41 , respectively .",
    "preferred orientation of crystallites accordingly leads to deviation from the ideal powder value @xmath34 = 2 .",
    "the backscattering spectrum of fe@xmath3niga ( fig .",
    "[ fig : moss_400 ] ) reveals a strongly diminished relative intensity of the second and fifth lines which suggests that the magnetization occurs essentially along the direction of the @xmath39-beam , i.e. perpendicular to the sample surface .",
    "+ well ordered and disordered regions appear to coexist in the sample of fe@xmath3cuga .",
    "the spectra of fe@xmath3cuga are best described by two sharp and an additional broad sextet .",
    "the @xmath22 values and thus also the magnetic moments of the sharp features are very similar to those of fe@xmath3nige .",
    "these signals are attributed to fe(a ) and fe(b ) sites in well ordered domains of the material with x structure .",
    "the broad feature is assigned to domains with strong disorder .",
    "the average @xmath22 of  265  koe corresponds just to the average of the @xmath22 values of the a and b sites .",
    "accordingly , although the distribution of the moments is changed in course of the disorder the average magnetic moment ( 4.2  @xmath5 per formula unit ) nearly remains the same .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that the total magnetic moments in heusler compounds frequently are not changed much by disorder .",
    "similar spectral shapes are also obtained for fe@xmath3cual .",
    "the spectra have been approximated by two hyperfine sextets . the sharp sextet with @xmath22=214  koe",
    "is assigned to fe(b ) sites with regular coordination geometry ( 4  fe and 4  al neighbors ) .",
    "its intensity contribution ( 33% ) is , however , smaller than for an ideal inverse heusler phase .",
    "the broad second sextet thus accounts for a superposition of fe sites with differing environment due to disorder . as in other al containing heusler compounds a pronounced b2-type exchange between fe and al sites",
    "is expected to contribute to the disorder  @xcite .",
    "antisite disorder between the fe(b ) and al sites is possibly the origin for an enhanced intensity contribution of fe(a)-like signals as fe atoms at al sites are in a similar environment as fe(a ) atoms .",
    "there is no clear evidence of an fe - based impurity in the spectrum of fe@xmath3cual although an impurity phase was detected in the xrd pattern .",
    "this is in accord with the clue from the xrd data that the impurity corresponds to a cu@xmath42al@xmath43 phase .",
    "+ having established the typical features of the mssbauer spectra for the present materials we now discuss the results with respect to the theoretical predictions of ref .  .",
    "for fe@xmath3coge the inverse cubic heusler structure was obtained as the most stable one .",
    "this is in agreement with the mssbauer spectra of fe@xmath3coge which show two well - defined fe sites .",
    "for all the other materials , however , the structure predictions are contradicted by the mssbauer spectra . in ref .",
    "an inverse heusler structure was suggested for fe@xmath3niga .",
    "in contrast , the mssbauer spectrum of fe@xmath3niga does not reveal the typical pattern of the inverse heusler structure .",
    "the broad features rather point towards a strongly disordered arrangement of the atoms . in case of fe@xmath3nige , fe@xmath3cuga , and",
    "fe@xmath3cual the inverse heusler structure was shown to be more stable than the regular one , but it was suggested that there is an inherent tendency for a structural distortion .",
    "hence , it was predicted that the regular tetragonal heusler structure becomes more stable for these materials . as it has been shown already in section  [ sec : struct ] , there is no sign of a tetragonal distortion in any of the present xrd patterns .",
    "the mssbauer spectrum suggests that it is essentially the inverse heusler structure which is adopted by fe@xmath3nige .",
    "also the spectra of fe@xmath3cuga and fe@xmath3cual show signatures of the inverse heusler structure , however , pronounced disorder is apparent from the spectra too .",
    "furthermore , there is no indication of quadrupole interactions in the mssbauer spectra which would be expected for tetragonal heusler phases .",
    "+ finally , we mention that we have tried to synthesize fe@xmath3znal , which has also been predicted as a regular tetragonal heusler phase  @xcite with a magnetic moment of @xmath444  @xmath5 .",
    "however , analysis of the mssbauer spectra and xrd data of a sample with nominal composition fe@xmath3znal revealed the presence of a non - magnetic component which was identified as feal .",
    "an additional magnetic component , the fraction of which increases from 10% in the 673  k annealed sample to 55% in the 1173  k sample presumably corresponds to fe@xmath7al .",
    "thus , the stabilization of a heusler phase was not successful in this case .",
    "in order to gain more insight into the atomic and electronic structure and magnetism of the fe@xmath3yz compounds , we have performed _ ab - initio _ electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "all calculations were carried out by using the fully - relativistic korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green s function method as implemented in the spr - kkr package  @xcite .",
    "the exchange and correlation was treated by the vosko - wilk - nusair form of the local density approximation ( lda )  @xcite .",
    "+ the lattice parameters were taken from the experimental data ( see table  [ exp_xrd ] ) .",
    "the primitive unit cell contains four atoms in the lattice with the wyckoff positions , , , . in the regular heusler structure",
    "the b and d positions are equivalent due to inversion symmetry , whereas in case of the inverse heusler structure these sites become inequivalent ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : heusler_inv_heusler ] ) . in case of the fully ordered fe@xmath3yz inverse heusler compounds",
    "sites a and b are occupied by fe , which we will refer as fe(a ) and fe(b ) site , respectively .",
    "since the mssbauer measurements have clearly shown that the heusler compounds in the fe@xmath3yz series show certain degree of chemical disorder , we have considered the anti - site disorder by using the so - called coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite . in the following we will consider the cubic heusler phases including the effects of disorder and non - stoichiometry .      to check",
    "whether the methodology presented above is suitable for the description of structural and magnetic properties of the fe@xmath3yz materials , first we have performed a set of calculations for fe@xmath3coge and compared the results with the data already available from the literature  @xcite .",
    "we have considered four different model systems in the cubic structure , where the site occupations were selected with the following configurations : ( a )  fully ordered heusler structure ; ( b )  chemically disordered structure ( 50  % of fe is mixed with co ) ; ( c )  chemically disordered inverse heusler phase ( 50  % of the fe sitting in position c mixed with co ) ; ( d )  a fully ordered inverse heusler structure .",
    "we found , that the structure stability increases from ( a ) to ( d ) .",
    "the configurations ( b ) and ( c ) are isoenergetic , sitting by 285  mev ( per formula unit ) lower than the ordered regular heusler structure ( a ) . finally , the most stable phase appears to be the fully ordered inverse heusler phase by about 30  mev lower energy compared to ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "thus , the ordered regular @xmath2 structure is unstable , and although disorder increases the stability , the most stable phase has the ordered inverse heusler structure .",
    "this is in good agreement with the experimental results , which suggest that fe@xmath3coge crystallizes as an inverse heusler compound with a rather small amount of antisite disorder . for fe@xmath3coge in the x - structure the computed total magnetic moment of 5.15  @xmath5 is in reasonable agreement with the experimental values of 5.0 - 5.4  @xmath5 ( see table  [ tab : magnet ] and ref .",
    "the calculated local moments are : 2.68 , 1.51 and 1.01  @xmath5 on fe(a ) , fe(b ) , and co , respectively .",
    "these computed values agree with the fe moments of 2.6 and 1.6  @xmath5 derived from the mssbauer spectrum of fe@xmath0coge .",
    "the present results are comparable with the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite which report the moments of 2.74 , 1.38 and 0.94  @xmath5 on fe(a ) , fe(b ) and co sites , respectively . by assuming the ferromagnetic order , one derives from the mssbauer data and the measured magnetization of 5.4  @xmath5 the local moment of co as 1.1  @xmath45 , in agreement with the present calculations .",
    "coge , where ( a ) and ( b ) panels correspond to the minority and majority spin channels , respectively .",
    "the red , blue and green curves refer to fe(a ) , fe(b ) and co contributions .",
    "the total dos is shown by a gray shaded area .",
    "[ fig : fe2coge - dos ] ]    as it follows from the calculated density of states ( dos ) for the ordered inverse heusler structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fe2coge - dos ] ) fe@xmath3coge is not a half - metallic ferromagnet ( which is also clear from ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the edx data ( see table  [ tab_edx ] ) for fe@xmath3nige indicate that the sample is slightly off - stoichiometric , with a small portion of fe ( about 2.5  % ) is substituted by ni .",
    "the lineshape of the mssbauer spectrum suggests that the sample essentially remains ordered , but in the structure there is a certain amount of disorder present .",
    "so , for fe@xmath3nige we have theoretically investigated nine different scenarios in the inverse heusler structure .",
    "first we have looked at the stoichiometric compound , where we considered : ( a )  the fully ordered inverse heusler structure ; ( b )  anti - site disorder between fe(a ) and ni , where 6  % of fe was substituted with ni ; ( c )  anti - site disorder between fe(b ) and ni , where 6  % of fe was substituted with ni ; ( d )  6  % substitution of fe(a ) with ge ; ( e )  6  % substitution of fe(b ) with ge . we have also studied the off - stoichiometric compositions , where the model systems were created via : ( f )  removal of 3  % of fe from site a ; ( g )  removal of 3  % of fe from site b ; ( h )  3  % substitution of fe(a ) by ni ; ( i )  3  % sustitution of fe(b ) by ni .",
    "indeed , calculations indicate that the fully ordered inverse heusler structure is not the most stable configuration for fe@xmath3nige .",
    "instead , the fe - ni anti - site disorder leads to more stable structures .",
    "namely , the compositions ( b ) and ( c ) are lower in energy compared to configuration ( a ) by 6 and 8  mev per formula unit , respectively . in contrast to the fe - ni , the fe - ge exchange is energetically unfavorable for each of the fe sites : compositions ( d ) and ( e ) are higher in energy by about 65 and 150  mev per formula unit compared to the fully ordered case .    still , these small energy differences between subsequent structures are comparable with the average thermal energy of the atoms at the annealing temperature , indicating that the detailed annealing conditions can control the nature of the disorder in the fe@xmath3yz inverse heusler phases .",
    "the energy of configuration ( f ) is found to be 15  mev lower than ( g ) , indicating that the creation of fe point defects in position ( a ) is more likely than in position ( b ) .",
    "if 3% of fe is substituted by an additional 3% of ni , the structures ( h ) and ( i ) are isoenergetic , i.e. in this specific case from the perspective of the total energy the system is not biased towards fe(a ) or fe(b ) sites .",
    "this means , that with slight ni excess , fe atoms are randomly removed both from positions a and b , and the empty sites are being occupied with ni .",
    "the spin - resolved and atom - projected dos computed for the fully ordered stoichiometric fe@xmath3nige in the inverse heusler structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe2nige - dos ] .",
    "nige , where panels ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the minority and majority spin channels , respectively .",
    "the contributions of fe(a ) , fe(b ) and ni are represented with red , blue and green curves .",
    "the total dos is shown by a gray shaded area .",
    "[ fig : fe2nige - dos ] ]    for the inverse heusler phase the calculated total moment is 4.47  @xmath5 per formula unit , which agrees with the experimental moments of 4.29 or 4.46  @xmath5 measured for the samples with squid magnetometry .",
    "the computed local moments on fe(a ) , fe(b ) and ni atoms are 2.53 , 1.67 and 0.29  @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the fe local moments agree with those derived from mssbauer measurements : 2.5 and 1.7  @xmath5 for the fe(a ) and fe(b ) sites .",
    "similar behavior was found for the disordered structures ( b)(e ) corresponding to the stoichiometric composition .    in cases",
    "( h ) and ( i ) in which fe was substituted by ni , corresponding to the composition measured via edx , the calculated total moments were 4.39 and 4.42  @xmath5 , respectively . for structures ( f ) and ( g ) , where 3  % of fe is missing ( no additional ni present ) , the total moments were 4.38 and 4.43  @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "for those cases which resemble the experimental composition , the respective local moments were 2.52 , 1.68 and 0.31  @xmath5 for configuration ( i ) and for structure ( h ) 2.54 , 1.67 and 0.29  @xmath5 for fe(a ) , fe(b ) and ni , respectively .",
    "thus , a small amount of disorder , fe deficiency or ni excess do not change considerably the magnetic properties of fe@xmath3nige in the inverse heusler structure .      in case of",
    "fe@xmath3niga the experimental results presented in the previous section have pointed out that the material exhibits rather strong degree of disorder . to sample the potential atomic arrangement in the disordered phase ,",
    "we have carried out calculations on eleven model systems each having a stoichiometric composition .",
    "the first scenario was the ordered inverse heusler structure , which served as reference .",
    "for the fully ordered structure we have calculated a magnetic moment of 4.81  @xmath5 , which is by about 0.6  @xmath5 higher than the experimentally measured value of 4.20  @xmath5 .",
    "next we have looked into the effect of antisite disorder upon the magnetization and energetics of fe@xmath3niga between fe(a ) and fe(b ) and ni and ga for stoichiometric compositions .",
    "we found , that by exchanging the site occupation of fe(a ) with 10 , 20 and 50% of ni , the structures generated hereby are higher in energy by about 14 , 15 and 89  mev per formula unit , respectively , compared to the ideal inverse heusler phase .",
    "this indicates that a small amount of fe(a ) ( up to about 1020  % ) can be exchanged by ni rather easily .",
    "in contrast to this , if one exchanges 50 - 60  % of fe(b ) with ni , the structure with fe(b)-ni antisite disorder becomes more stable by about 9  mev per formula unit than the ordered phase .",
    "thus , in case of fe@xmath3niga the ground state does not correspond to the fully ordered inverse heusler phase .",
    "for the lowest energy configuration the calculated total moment is 4.77  @xmath5 , where the local moments on fe(a ) , fe(b ) and ni are 2.65 , 1.86 and 0.33  @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "thus , the magnetic moment of this structure is still higher than the squid data by about 4.2  @xmath5 per unit cell .    also the average moment on the fe sites of 2.25",
    "@xmath5 is somewhat higher than the average moment of 2.05  @xmath5 estimated from the broad sextets in the mssbauer spectrum . upon exchanging either fe(a ) or fe(b ) with ga the disordered structures",
    "were all unstable relative to the reference case independent of the fe position .",
    "the total magnetic moments of the systems with fe - ni and fe - ga exchange are computed in the range from 5.03 to 4.59  @xmath5 .    due to the fact that the mssbauer spectra may suggest random alloying , we have also considered the case of an a2-type structure , where the constituent atoms are randomly distributed on all four lattice sites .",
    "the calculations have shown , that such an a2-type random structure where all atoms are coupled ferromagnetically , is rather unstable , by about 440  mev per formula unit compared to the reference , which is the ordered inverse heusler phase .",
    "for the fe@xmath3cuga sample the experiment reveals both well - ordered and disordered regions .",
    "since the ordered regions should correspond to the ideal ferromagnetic inverse heusler structure , we have first investigated this configuration .",
    "the corresponding spin - resolved and atom - projected dos is shown in figure  [ fig : fe2cuga - dos ] .",
    "cuga . panels ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the minority and majority spin channels , respectively .",
    "the contributions of fe(a ) , fe(b ) and cu are shown with red , blue and green curves , respectively , and the total dos is shown by a gray shaded area . [",
    "fig : fe2cuga - dos ] ]    the calculated total magnetic moment of 4.04  @xmath5 is somewhat larger than the experimental one ( 3.6  @xmath5 ) derived from the squid measurements .",
    "the origin of this small discrepancy can not be resolved unambiguously , however , the experimental moment may be too small due to the presence of the minor impurity phase as suggested by the xrd pattern . on the other hand , the calculated local moments of 2.34  @xmath5 for fe(a ) and 1.78  @xmath5 for fe(b ) sites agree with the corresponding values of 2.5 and 1.7  @xmath5 derived from the sharp features in the mssbauer spectrum .",
    "the moments on the cu and ga sites are negligibly small .    to gain new insights via cpa on the potential nature of the disordered phase ,",
    "we have carried out calculations for six configurations taking into account various kinds of fe - cu and fe - ga antisite disorder .",
    "the calculations indicate that 50  % of cu - fe(a ) exchange leads to a more stable structure compared to the fully ordered inverse heusler structure with a stabilization energy of 71  mev per primitive unit cell . beside this",
    ", we found that an even more stable configuration can be created via chemical disorder , where alloying is present between fe and cu , with 18 , 44 and 44  % of fe - cu antisite exchange on wyckoff positions a , b and d , respectively .",
    "this structure is by 110  mev lower in energy compared to the ideal ordered inverse heusler structure , which indicates that the system might undergo a spontaneous mixing between fe and cu , giving rise to the appearance of a broad sextet seen in the mssbauer spectra . for the systems with fe - cu disorder the total magnetic moments assuming ferromagnetic ordering",
    "have been calculated to be in the range of 4.29 - 4.31  @xmath5 , where the local moments were 2.48 , 1.95 and 1.94  @xmath5 for fe(a ) , fe(b ) and fe(d ) , respectively .",
    "the average value of 2.1  @xmath5 over these sites is in good agreement with the average moment of 2.1  @xmath5 estimated from the hyperfine field value of the broad sextet .",
    "next we considered the effect of fe - ga disorder , which has shown that even a small amount of fe - ga antisites is energetically unfavorable . for 10  % of antisite disorder on fe(a ) or fe(b ) sites the structures were less stable , by about 30 and 85  mev per formula unit , respectively , compared to the ordered inverse heusler structure .",
    "this indicates that fe - ga antisite disorder in fe@xmath3cuga is less likely to happen than fe - cu alloying .",
    "the calculated total moments in case of fe - ga antisite disorder are in the range of 4.15 - 4.25  @xmath5 which are only slightly enhanced compared to the ideal x - structure .      for the fe@xmath3cual sample",
    "it was found experimentally , that the sextet assigned to fe(b ) in the mssbauer spectra has a lower intensity than it should have in the ordered inverse heusler phase , indicating that there is a certain amount of disorder involved . also , there is a second broad sextet with enhanced relative intensity present , pointing towards different local fe coordination environments .",
    "these spectral features suggest an inverse heusler structure , where fe(b)-al antisite disorder leads to an enhanced fraction of fe(a)-like sites .",
    "we have first investigated the ideal x - phase of fe@xmath3cual theoretically , for which the computed total dos and atom projected dos is shown in fig.[fig : fe2cual - dos ] .",
    "cual , where ( a ) and ( b ) panels correspond to the minority and majority spin channels , respectively .",
    "the red , blue and green curves refer to fe(a ) , fe(b ) and cu contributions .",
    "the total dos is shown by a gray shaded area .",
    "[ fig : fe2cual - dos ] ]    the calculated total moment of 3.80  @xmath5 considering ferromagnetic ordering is somewhat higher than the measured value of 3.3  @xmath5 .",
    "the experimental value may , however , be too small as there is an impurity phase evident in the xrd pattern .",
    "similar to the case of fe@xmath3cuga the local moments deduced from the mssbauer spectra on fe(a ) and fe(b ) sites of 2.2 and 1.7  @xmath5 , are in a real good agreement with the calculated local moments of 2.23 and 1.67  @xmath5 .",
    "this confirms that fe@xmath3cual basically crystallizes in a cubic inverse heusler structure .",
    "further , we studied the effects of fe - cu or fe - al antisites . up to 30% of fe - cu antisite exchange",
    "the structure is more stable by about 12  mev per formula unit compared to the ideal inverse structure , and going above 30% the structure become less stable by about around 15  mev .    by exchanging fe with al the calculations show that the structures generated are practically isoenergetic with the ordered inverse heusler structure .",
    "this result agrees with the experimental observations from ref .  .",
    "the total moments for configurations with fe - cu and fe - al disorder are in the range of 3.91 - 3.96 and 3.80 - 3.81  @xmath5 , respectively , which is similar as in case of the fully ordered heusler phase .",
    "thus , the calculations indicate , that although there is a slight bias towards the fe - cu antisite disorder , in fe@xmath3cual the spontaneous formation of both fe - cu and fe - al type disorder is highly likely .",
    "as it follows , in many cases the antisite disorder does not change radically the magnetic properties of the heusler compounds .",
    "+      finally we considered the case of fe@xmath3znal ( predicted theoretically  @xcite ) .",
    "we have investigated the hypothetical inverse cubic heusler structure , and found that the calculated total moment of 3.27  @xmath5 is nearly twice larger than the experimental moment of a sample with the nominal composition fe@xmath3znal .",
    "such significant discrepancy suggests that the sample is not a heusler phase .",
    "in fact , the xrd and mssbauer data revealed that in the mixed - phase samples non - magnetic feal , in addition to fe@xmath7al were the major iron - based components .",
    "we have synthesized and characterized the new iron - based heusler phases fe@xmath0nige , fe@xmath0cuga , and fe@xmath0cual , the existence of which has been suggested by previous theoretical work  @xcite . in addition",
    "we have investigated in more detail the known compounds fe@xmath0coge and fe@xmath0niga .",
    "the newly synthesized fe@xmath0yz phases were predicted to adopt a regular tetragonal heusler structure , whereas the present experimental results revealed that the materials basically crystallize in the cubic inverse heusler ( x- ) structure with differing degrees of atomic disorder .",
    "for these fe - based materials @xmath1fe mssbauer spectroscopy is a very useful local - probe technique to unravel the atomic disorder and to estimate the magnetic moments at the iron sites .",
    "all the compounds are soft ferromagnets with curie temperatures up to about 900 k which makes them suitable for potential magnetic applications .",
    "the electronic structures of the materials have been studied by _",
    "ab - initio _ dft calculations including the effects of disorder and nonstoichiometry within the cpa approximation .",
    "the good agreement between calculated and experimental magnetic moments at the fe sites is further support that the compounds basically adopt the cubic inverse heusler structure .",
    "atomic disorder which is apparent in the experimental data leads to further stabilization of the cubic structure without changing the magnetic properties too much .",
    "the case of fe@xmath0niga , which was predicted to crystallize in the cubic x - structure is not completely clear yet . both , xrd and mssbauer data evidence an increased atomic disorder and the calculated magnetic moments are somewhat higher than the experimental ones . attempts to synthesize fe@xmath0znal , a further phase which was also suggested to adopt the tetragonal heusler structure  @xcite , were unsuccessful .",
    "while there is a good consistency between the present experimental and theoretical results for the cubic inverse heusler fe@xmath0yz materials it remains to be clarified why fe@xmath0nige , fe@xmath0cuga , and fe@xmath0cual do not adopt the tetragonal structures predicted previously .",
