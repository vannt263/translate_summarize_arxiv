    "macroscopic metastable states of trapped cold atom systems have been a subject of active experimental and theoretical study for more than a decade @xcite . unlike a homogeneous system of bosons , where infinitesimally small attractive interaction between atoms leads to a collapse , trapped bosons",
    "are known to form long lived bose - einstein condensates @xcite ( bec ) due to zero - point energy which , for sufficiently low densities , can compensate the negative interaction energy thus maintaining the system in equilibrium . upon",
    "increasing the bec density , interaction energy grows , and , at some instability point ( i.e. , at a certain number of particles in the trap @xmath0 , with @xmath1 for a typical trap ) , zero - point energy can no longer sustain the negative pressure due to the interactions and the system collapses .",
    "it has been argued in the literature @xcite that near the instability point ( for bec densities slightly lower than the instability density ) , the effective energy barrier that prevents bec from collapsing becomes so low that the system can quantum mechanically tunnel into the dense ( collapsed ) state .",
    "such phenomenon of macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) , however , has never been observed experimentally due to a strong dependence of the barrier height on the total number of particles in the trap ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "indeed it has been shown @xcite that the tunneling exponent for such a transition near the instability point scales as @xmath3 and therefore very fine tuning of the total particle number @xmath2 is required in order to keep the tunneling exponent relatively small [ @xmath4 . since for most bec setups",
    "the total number of the trapped atoms fluctuates and typically obeys poissonian statistics , the error in @xmath2 scales as @xmath5 and therefore such a stringent requirement is hard to fulfill .",
    "thus the system is typically either in a sub - critical state with no barrier present ( @xmath6 ) or is in the state with very high energy barrier and therefore very low mqt rate .    in this paper",
    "we propose another paradigm for observation of tunneling driven phase transition effects in cold atom systems based on the theory of quantum nucleation @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that a mixture of @xmath7he-@xmath8he undergoes a phase separation transition at relative concentration of @xmath7he in @xmath8he of around @xmath9 at temperatures close to the absolute zero  @xcite .",
    "since such a phase separation is a first order phase transition ( it is observed to be accompanied by the latent heat release down to mk temperatures ) , the order parameter must have some finite ( microscopic ) correlation length and therefore the transition is expected to occur through the formation of nuclei of the new stable phase in the old metastable one . as usual ,",
    "dynamics of the nucleation process is controlled by the competition of the surface and bulk energies of the nuclei and therefore , in order for a given nucleus to become stable ( supercritical ) , it must overcome a potential barrier formed by the two above contributions .",
    "while in most systems such a transition is a thermally activated process , it has been argued that in the @xmath7he-@xmath8he mixture at sufficiently low temperatures ( below 100 mk ) the transition is driven by the quantum tunneling . in particular ,",
    "it was predicted @xcite that near the transition line the tunneling exponent for such a transition rate is proportional to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the difference in the chemical potentials of the two phases .",
    "it has later been found experimentally @xcite that below 80 mk kinetics of such phase separation transition becomes independent on temperature and therefore it must be driven by the quantum tunneling . however , the experiments have been unable to verify the expected dependence of the nucleation rate on the systems s parameters ( i.e. , @xmath12 , etc ) - partly due to the poor knowledge of microscopic interactions between particles in such a strongly correlated system .",
    "we argue that contemporary cold atom systems provide an excellent candidate for studying and observing the kinetics of such a phase separation transition in boson - fermion mixtures @xcite .",
    "mixtures of boson and fermion atoms are typically realized in experiments studying fermionic superfluidity , where bosons play role of a coolant @xcite .",
    "another interesting realization of boson - fermion mixture has been demonstrated in two - component fermion system , where strongly bound cooper pairs correspond to bosons interacting with unpaired fermion atoms @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we begin with detailed derivation and analysis of the results outlined in ref .  .",
    "significant attention is given to supercritical dynamics , which reflects the dissipative mechanisms and is measurable in less interacting system .",
    "starting from a microscopic description of a boson - fermion mixture we derive an effective action for the order parameter ( the bec density ) taking into account fermion - boson interaction .",
    "we show explicitly that the classical potential for the order parameter due to such interaction has two minima corresponding to the two phases of the system ( mixed and phase separated ) , see sec .",
    "[ sec : phases ] .",
    "we analyze the coherence length associated with the system and demonstrate that it varies from finite to divergent and therefore allows different mechanisms for the phase transition , see sec .",
    "[ sec : equil ] . at low fermion densities",
    "the two minima of the potential are separated by the finite energy barrier resulting in finite coherence length , which points out that such a transition is of the first order @xcite .",
    "we then derive an expression for the nucleation ( tunneling ) rate of the critical droplet of the pure fermion phase near the phase transition line and near the line of absolute ( spinodal ) instability of the mixed phase in secs .",
    "[ sec : i - ii ] and [ sec : spinodal ] .",
    "we show that the transition rate is measurable ( of the order @xmath13s@xmath14m@xmath15 ) for densities reasonably close to the phase transition line and small fermion - boson mass ratio .",
    "the limitation on the mass ratio comes as the result of dissipative dynamics due excitations in fermion system . near the phase transition line it leads to significant modification ( increase ) of the transition rate for the system with high fermion - boson mass ratio , in which case the observable transition rates exist closer to the line of absolute instability ( where the dissipation is less effective and the tunneling exponent becomes reasonably small ) .",
    "our results for this regime are similar to those obtained in ref .",
    "for the mqt in the systems of trapped bosons with attractive interactions .",
    "however , in the case of boson - fermion separation transition the height of the potential barrier and , thus , the tunneling exponent are controlled not by the total number of particles in the trap , but their densities , scaling as @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently large numbers of particles in the trap the tunneling exponent can be fine - tuned with a desired accuracy which makes it possible to observe the mqt rate in a well controlled and predictable regime .",
    "we consider a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) interacting with a single species of fermions ( in the same spin state ) .",
    "interactions in such the mixture are characterized by two scattering lengths @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "fermions and bosons interact through contact potential @xmath19 , contributing term @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are boson and fermion fields respectively . in addition , boson - boson particle interaction give rise to another term @xmath24 in the hamiltonian density , with @xmath25 .",
    "the direct coupling between fermions is negligible : s - scattering channel is forbidden for the fermions in the same spin state , while p - wave scattering is small compared to boson - boson and boson - fermion contact interaction .",
    "the potential part of the energy density can be cast in the form @xmath26 for the purposes of the present calculation we can neglect the spatial dependence of the trapping potential and assume that the local densities of fermions and bosons are set by the constant chemical potentials @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "indeed , since the nucleation occurs at finite coherence length ( to be defined below ) , the shape of the trapping potential should play little role in the dynamics of the phase transition as long as the effective size of the trap is much greater than the coherence length .",
    "it is convenient to describe the system in terms of the boson field only , tracing @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the overall hamiltonian ) with respect to the fermion field .",
    "such averaging can be easily carried out within mean field , i.e. , the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite , so that the calculation reduces to the evaluation of the canonical partition function ( or free energy ) of the free fermions with effective chemical potential @xmath31 .",

    "[ sec : equil ] , we will proceed beyond this approximation and account for the fermion excitations interacting with the condensate . for the purpose of this and the following section such",
