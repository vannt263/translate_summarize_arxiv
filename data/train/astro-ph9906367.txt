    "1998 ; puget et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the high sensitivity of these experiments will result in unique data to constrain fundamental cosmological parameters .",
    "moreover , future cmb maps will allow to distinguish between competing theories of structure formation in the early universe and will provide very fruitful data on astrophysical foregrounds .",
    "the cosmological signal in cmb maps is hampered by instrumental noise and by foreground emissions .",
    "therefore , a necessary step in analysing cmb maps is to separate the foreground emissions from the cmb signal . several linear and non - linear methods",
    "have already been tested on simulated data ( bouchet , gispert & puget 1996 ; tegmark & efstathiou 1996 ; hobson et al .",
    "1998a , b ) .",
    "an alternative method can be one based on wavelets .",
    "wavelets are known to be very efficient in dealing with problems of data compression and denoising .",
    "development of wavelet techniques applied to signal processing has been very fast in the last ten years ( see jawerth & sweldens 1994 for an overview ) .",
    "these techniques have already been applied to a variety of astrophysical problems .",
    "for example , regarding cosmology , slezak , de lapparent & bijaoui ( 1993 ) have applied wavelet analysis to the detection of structures in the cfa redshift survey .",
    "they have also been introduced to study the gaussian character of cmb maps ( pando et al .",
    "1998 , hobson et al .",
    "a study using spherical haar wavelets to denoise cmb maps has just appeared ( tenorio et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we consider small patches of the sky where a flat 2-d approach is valid .",
    "we apply wavelet multiresolution techniques , known to be computationally very fast taking only @xmath6 operations to reconstruct an image of @xmath7 pixels . in the 2-d flat wavelet analysis a single scale and two translations are usually introduced , where the basis is generated by 4 tensor products of wavelets and scaling functions .",
    "therefore , three _ detail _",
    "images plus an _ approximation _ image appear at each level of resolution .",
    "different wavelet bases are characterized by their location in space .",
    "the bases considered in this work are mexican hat , haar and daubechies .",
    "the first one is the most localized though , as opposed to the other two , it does not have a compact support . as a first approach to the application of these techniques to cmb data",
    "we only consider maps with cosmological signal plus instrumental gaussian noise .",
    "cmb experiments are contaminated by galactic ( dust , free - free and synchrotron emission ) and extragalactic foregrounds ( infrared and radio galaxies , s - z effects from clusters , ... ) in addition to noise . obviously in view of this",
    ", the contents of this paper only cover a small fraction of the work to be done .",
    "our aim is to shed light on the wavelet characterization of the different components , the late phase being to build up a wavelet - based framework to disentagle all of them . in this line ,",
    "a bayessian method ( maybe incorporating entropy or other constraints ) dealing with wavelet components at different scales and integrating the different channels will be the final goal .",
    "knowing the efficiency of wavelets in removing noise as shown by many works in other fields , the first step to take in the application of wavelet techniques to the cmb is to study the denoising of temperature maps .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "a theoretical continuous wavelet analyis of cmb data is presented in section 2 .",
    "general semianalytical formulae are given for the variance of the _ detail _ wavelet coefficients as a function of the temperature power spectrum @xmath2 .",
    "section 3 introduces the discrete wavelet technique that is applied to denoising of simulated cmb maps in section 4 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the fourier transform is a powerful tool in many areas but in dealing with local behaviour shows a tremendous inefficiency . for instance , a large number of complex exponentials must be combined in order to produce a spike .",
    "the wavelet transform solves this problem , introducing a good space - frequency localization .",
    "it is conceptually simple and it constitutes a fast algorithm . let @xmath8 be a one - dimensional function satisfying the following conditions : a ) @xmath9 , b ) @xmath10 and c ) @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the fourier transform of @xmath8 .",
    "so , according to condition a ) , the wavelet must have oscillations .",
    "condition b ) is a normalization and c ) represents an admissibility condition in order to reconstruct a function @xmath13 with the basis @xmath14 ( see equation ( 2 ) for such a synthesis ) .",
    "we define the _ analyzing _ wavelet as @xmath15 , dependent on two parameters : dilation ( @xmath16 ) and translation ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "it operates as a mathematical microscope of magnification @xmath18 at the space point @xmath17 .",
    "the wavelet coefficients associated to a one - dimensional function @xmath13 are :    @xmath19    it is clear from the above definition that such coefficients represent the analyzing wavelet at @xmath20 for a delta distribution peaked at this point , i.e. for @xmath21 . for @xmath22",
    ", @xmath23 is the convolution of the function @xmath24 with the analyzing wavelet @xmath14 .",
    "the reconstruction of the function @xmath24 can be achieved in the form    @xmath25    examples of wavelet functions are : i ) haar , @xmath26 for @xmath27 @xmath28 , ii ) mexican hat , @xmath29 .",
    "regarding the two - dimensional case , we introduce a one - dimensional _ scaling _ function @xmath30 normalized in the form : @xmath31 .",
    "examples of scaling functions are : i ) haar , @xmath32 @xmath33 for @xmath34 @xmath35 , ii ) mexican hat , @xmath36 . the analyzing _ scaling _",
    "@xmath37 , allows to define _ details _ of an image , @xmath38 , with respect to the tensor products    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    the _ diagonal , horizontal _ and _ vertical _ wavelet coefficients are defined by ( @xmath42 )    @xmath43    scaling functions act as low - pass filters whereas wavelet functions single out one scale .",
    "therefore , _ detail _",
    "coefficients provide local information about symmetrical ( diagonal ) and elongated / filamentary structure ( vertical and horizontal ) .",
    "let us now assume an homogeneous an isotropic random field @xmath38",
    ", i.e. the correlation function @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes an average value over realizations of the field .",
    "the fourier transform of the field @xmath47 satisfies @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the power spectrum ( the fourier transform of @xmath51 ) . in this case",
    "we can calculate the correlation and variance of the wavelet coefficients : @xmath52 and we find the following equations    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the fourier transform of @xmath55 .    on the other hand",
    ", we calculate the fourier transform of the wavelet coefficients @xmath56 with respect to the @xmath57 parameters :    @xmath58    @xmath59    that allows us to get the _ detail _",
    "wavelet variances as    @xmath60    the diagonal variance corresponds to the tensor product of two one - dimensional wavelets .",
    "if @xmath61 is a function strongly peaked near @xmath62 then @xmath63 , taking into account the normalization of the wavelet function , that allows an estimation of the power spectrum in terms of the diagonal component .",
    "this is what happens for the mexican hat : @xmath64 , with a maximum at @xmath65 , whereas the haar wavelet is not localized in fourier space : @xmath66",
    ". we can also deduce that @xmath67 and @xmath68 taking into account the symmetry of the equations .",
    "moreover , the temperature power spectrum @xmath50 can be obtained from the _ detail _ wavelet power spectrum @xmath69 as follows @xmath70    for the haar and mexican wavelets we can calculate :    @xmath71 ^ 4\\ ; , \\ ] ]    @xmath72 ^ 4 \\frac{1}{4}{\\sin}^2 k_1\\ ; , \\ ] ]    @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be obtained from @xmath76 , swapping @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the variance of the _ detail _ wavelet coefficients for the haar and mexican hat systems , assuming the standard cdm model , is presented in figure 1 .",
    "as one can see the acoustic peaks can be clearly noticed , being more pronounced for the mexican hat basis . this last result is a consequence of being a more localized wavelet system . for a more detailed discussion",
    "see sanz et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 .",
    "an orthonormal basis of @xmath79 can be constructed from a wavelet @xmath14 through dyadic dilations @xmath80 and translations @xmath81 @xmath82 in addition , a scaling function @xmath30 can be defined associated to the _ mother _ wavelet @xmath83 .",
    "such a function gives rise to the so called multiresolution analysis .",
    "a multiresolution analysis of @xmath79 is defined as a sequence of closed subspaces @xmath84 of @xmath79 , @xmath85 .",
    "properties can be seen in ogden ( 1997 ) .",
    "subspaces @xmath84 are generated by dyadic dilations and translations of the scaling function @xmath86 ( this function forms an orthonormal basis of @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) . moreover",
    "each @xmath84 can be expressed as the orthogonal sum @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is created from wavelets @xmath91 .",
    "taking into account the properties of the scaling function , together with this last expression , we can construct _ approximations _ at increasing levels of resolution .",
    "these _ approximations _ are linear combinations of dilations and translations of a scaling function @xmath86 .",
    "the difference between two consecutive _ approximations _ ,",
    "i.e. the _ detail _ at the corresponding resolution level , is given by a linear combination of dilations and translations of a wavelet function @xmath83 .",
    "the analysis performed in this work assumes equal dilations in the 2 dimensions involved . at a fixed level of resolution ,",
    "subspaces in a 2-d multiresolution analysis are the tensor products of the corresponding one - dimensional ones @xmath92.the 2-d basis is therefore built by the product of two scaling functions ( _ approximation _ ) , the product of wavelet and scaling functions ( horizontal and vertical _ details _ ) and the product of two wavelets ( diagonal _ details _ ) : @xmath93 @xmath94\\ ; .\\ ] ] horizontal , vertical and diagonal _ detail _ coefficients represent the variations in these directions relative to a weighted average at a lower resolution level ( given by the _ approximation _ coefficients )",
    ".    a discrete orthonormal basis , @xmath95 , can be defined by setting @xmath96 and @xmath97 in equations ( 3 - 5 ) , then @xmath98 , where @xmath99 denotes the scalar product in @xmath100 .",
    "if we define the discrete wavelet coefficients associated to any _ detail _ by the equation ( 6 )    @xmath101    we can thus reconstruct the image with all the _ details _",
    "@xmath102    in particular , we get the following expression for the second - order moment of the image    @xmath103    that expresses how the energy of the field is distributed locally at any scale and _ detail_.    for a finite image , @xmath104 , in order to reconstruct it we must add to equation ( 19 ) an approximation @xmath105 with @xmath106 @xmath107 and @xmath108 , representing the field at the lower resolution . if @xmath109 represents the temperature fluctuation field then the variance is given by @xmath110 , being @xmath111 the number of pixels .",
    "the orthonormal basis that we are going to use are the standard daubechies @xmath7 ( haar corresponds to @xmath112 ) , that has been extensively used in the literature because of their special properties : they are defined in a compact support , have increasing regularity with @xmath7 and vanishing moments up to order @xmath113 ( daubechies 1988 ) . on the contrary",
    ", the mexican hat wavelet is not defined in a compact support and it is not appropriate for this multiresolution analysis .    for discrete wavelet analysis of the cmb maps we use the matlab wavelet toolbox ( misiti et al .",
    "this toolbox is an extensive collection of programs for analyzing , denoising and compressing signals and 2-d images .",
    "discrete wavelet decomposition is performed as described above to obtain the _ approximation _ and _ detail _ coefficients of the 2-d cmb maps at several levels .",
    "future cmb space experiments will provide maps with resolution scales of few arcminutes . in this work",
    "we analyze simulated maps of @xmath114 square degrees with pixel size of @xmath115 arcmin .",
    "simulations are made assuming the standard cdm , @xmath116 and @xmath117 km / sec / mpc .",
    "the maps are filtered with a @xmath118 fwhm gaussian beam to approximately reproduce the filtering scale of the high frequency channels of the planck mission .",
    "simulated maps have a rms signal of @xmath119 .",
    "gaussian noise is added to these maps at different @xmath120 levels between @xmath121 and 3 . a non - uniform noise is also considered to account for the non - uniform sampling introduced in satellite observations . as an extreme case we have assigned the signal - to - noise at each pixel from a truncated ( at the @xmath122 level ) gaussian distribution with a mean value of 2 and a dispersion of @xmath123 .",
    "we use the set of matlab wavelet 2-d programs with the corresponding graphical interface to analyze and denoise those maps .",
    "suitable bases of wavelets are studied .",
    "daubechies 4 wavelets are the ones used in this analysis .",
    "no significant changes are observed when the analysis is carried out using other higher order daubechies bases . on the other hand , the haar system is not so efficient for denoising cmb maps since it produces reconstruction errors much larger than using high order daubechies systems .",
    "first of all , three wavelet decompositions are performed obtaining wavelet coefficients corresponding to the cmb original map , to the signal plus noise map and to the pure noise map .",
    "decompositions are carried out up to the fourth resolution level .",
    "denoising of the signal plus noise maps is based on subtraction of certain sets of coefficients affected by noise .",
    "white noise is the most common in cmb experiments .",
    "the dispersion of wavelet coefficients of that type of noise is constant as can be seen from equation 10 . on the contrary cmb detail",
    "wavelet dispersions go to zero as @xmath16 goes to zero .",
    "therefore first level wavelet coefficients are dominated by noise and then , for a given signal plus noise map , it is possible to know the noise and consequently the cmb wavelet coefficient dispersions at all levels .",
    "cmb maps produced by typical experiments with a ratio between antenna and pixel size of @xmath124 will have wavelet coefficients containing the relevant information on the signal at level 3 and above .",
    "as shown below , level 3 is the critical one to perform denoising as the noise can still be at a level comparable to the signal .",
    "figure 2 shows rms deviations and corresponding ratios for two simulations with @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "_ detail _ coefficient numbering corresponds to the three directions diagonal , vertical and horizontal at the three consecutive levels , i.e. , numbers 1,2,3 correspond to diagonal , vertical and horizontal cofficients at the first resolution level , 4,5,6 to the second level coefficients in the same order and 7,8,9,10,11,12 to levels 3 and 4 respectively .",
    "as it can be seen , the first two levels are entirely dominated by noise as pointed out before .",
    "therefore , all these coefficients can be removed to reconstruct a denoised map .",
    "this is equivalent to using a hard thresholding assuming a threshold above all these coefficients . on the other side , level 4",
    "is completely dominated by the cmb signal and is left untouched .",
    "ratios between rms deviations of the signal and noise maps at the third resolution level are not always clearly dominated by noise or signal .",
    "ratios of @xmath127 are treated with a soft thresholding technique ( in practice we consider ratios in the range @xmath128 though changes in this interval do not significantly affect results ) .",
    "soft thresholding consists of removing all coefficients with absolute values smaller than the threshold defined in terms of the noise dispersion ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "coefficients with absolute values above the defined threshold are rescaled by subtracting the threshold to the positive ones and adding it to the negative ones . to define these thresholds we use the so called sure thresholding technique introduced by donoho & johnstone 1995 .",
    "this technique is based on finding an estimator of the signal that will minimize the expected loss or risk defined as the mean value of @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the temperature at pixel @xmath132 in the original signal map and @xmath133 is the estimator at pixel @xmath132 ( temperature in the final denoised map ) .",
    "the minimization is finally achieved in the wavelet domain by choosing a threshold value that minimizes the risk at each wavelet level ( see for instance ogden 1997 ) .",
    "results of the errors in the map reconstruction are shown in table 1 .",
    "the map error is defined as : @xmath134 performing 20 simulations ( proved to be enough as results reached stable values ) at each s / n level we have also calculated the @xmath135 error .",
    "the error improvement achieved with the denoising technique applied goes from factors of 3 to 5 for @xmath136 to @xmath125 .",
    "c|c s / n & @xmath137 map error @xmath138    0.7 & 26.3@xmath1390.4 1.0 & 20.7@xmath1390.4 2.0 & 13.3@xmath1390.2 2.0 ( n.u . ) & 14.3@xmath1390.3 3.0 & 10.3@xmath1390.2    it is also interesting to see how well the denoising method performs to reconstruct the temperature power spectrum .",
    "mean values and @xmath135 errors of the relative errors , @xmath140 , are shown in figure 3 for three @xmath120 ratios and the case of non - uniform noise considered in this work .",
    "the @xmath2 s are reconstructed from the denoised maps with @xmath141 up to @xmath142 in cases @xmath143 .",
    "this error can only be achieved up to an @xmath144 in the @xmath125 case .",
    "higher order multipoles ( @xmath145 ) are reconstructed with @xmath146 .",
    "absolute relative errors and reconstructed @xmath2 s for a given map are presented in figures 4 and 5 respectively .    in order to check the performance of the sure thresholding technique , knowing the original maps we can find the optimal threshold to get a reconstructed map with a minimum error ( as defined above ) . in @xmath147 maps the optimal threshold is found to be @xmath148",
    ". thresholds between @xmath149 do not make substantial changes in the reconstructed map ( see table 2 ) . the hard case included in that table stands for a case where all coefficients below a signal - to - noise dispersion ration @xmath150 are removed , leaving the others untouched . for comparison ,",
    "the error obtained comparing the signal plus noise map with the original signal map is also presented in table 2 .",
    "we can see that the error reconstruction achieved with the sure technique equals the one obtained with the optimal threshold .    c|c threshold & @xmath137 map error    hard & 23.5 1.5 @xmath129 & 21.7 1.0 @xmath129 & 20.7 0.7 @xmath129 & 20.5 0.6 @xmath129 & 20.6 0.5 @xmath129 & 20.7 0.4 @xmath129 & 21.0 0.3 @xmath129 & 21.3 signal+noise & 100.0    a comparison of wavelet techniques with wiener filter ( see for instance press et al .",
    "1994 ) has also been performed . in relation to map reconstruction the error affecting the wiener reconstructed maps is comparable to the error for the wavelet reconstructed maps , in all cases .",
    "however , in order to apply wiener filter previous knowledge of signal power spectrum is requiered . reconstructed and residual maps using both , wavelets and wiener filter , are shown in figure 6 . regarding the @xmath2s ,",
    "performance of wiener filter is clearly worse than wavelets for @xmath151 , as can be seen in figure 4 .",
    "for example , for a @xmath147 the @xmath2s are recovered using wiener filter with an error between 20@xmath137 and 70@xmath137 for @xmath152s between 1000 and 1500 being this error smaller by a factor of 2 - 4 for wavelet reconstruction .",
    "the error is also clearly larger for wiener reconstruction than for wavelet reconstruction , up to @xmath153 in cases with @xmath154 .",
    "we have checked for non - gaussian features possibly introduced by the non - linearity of the soft thresholding used in the wavelet methods applied for denoising .",
    "distributions of skewness and kurtosis have been obtained for the original signal maps as well as for the denoised ones .",
    "no significant differences can be appreciated between both distributions .",
    "however this method could not be good enough to detect non - gaussian features .",
    "as recently claimed by hobson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the analysis of the distribution of wavelet coefficients is one of the most efficient methods to detect them .",
    "we have performed a similar analysis using the daubechies 4 multiresolution wavelet coefficients .",
    "these coefficients are gaussian distributed in the case of a temperature gaussian random field .",
    "the application of soft thresholding to the wavelet coefficients at a certain level clearly changes the gaussian distribution by removing all coefficients whose absolute values are below the imposed threshold and shifting the remaining ones by that threshold . as an example , in the previous case @xmath147 the kurtosis of the diagonal level 3 distribution changes from @xmath155 to @xmath156 ! ( notice that the change strongly depends on the threshold imposed ) .",
    "this result is not surprising as any non - linear method used for denoising or foreground separation will introduce non - gaussinity at different levels in the reconstructed map .",
    "fortunately there are two ways of overcoming the question of determining the gaussianity of the cmb signal .",
    "one way would be to check the gaussian character of the data before applying denoising to maps affected by gaussian noise .",
    "we have checked this by looking at the multiresolution wavelet coefficient distributions in the case of @xmath147 .",
    "the addition of white noise did nt change the mean value and error bar of the kurtosis . the second way would be applying a linear denoising method .",
    "we have used a simple one consisting in removing all detail coefficients at levels with signal - to - noise dispersion ratio @xmath150 ( notice that @xmath115 corresponds the upper value of the threshold interval where soft thresholding was applied ) .",
    "this method is equivalent to applying hard thresholding with a threshold above all the coefficients .",
    "the errors of the reconstructed map and its corresponding @xmath157s increase slightly compared to the sure thresholding method ( see table 2and top - left panel of figure 4 ) .",
    "the same hard thresholding linear method will give even better results using 2-d wavelets with two scales of dilation ( sanz et al .",
    "1999 ) instead of the one - scale multiresolution techniques , since the former works with many more resolution levels being therefore more selective in removing the coefficients .",
    "a wavelet multiresolution technique has been presented and used to analyse and denoise cmb maps .",
    "this method has been proved to be one of the best to reconstruct observed cmb maps as well as power spectra by removing a significant percentage of the noise .",
    "the analysis has been carried out assuming a uniform gaussian noise as would be expected in a small sky patch , e.g. @xmath0 , observed by satellite scans .",
    "analysis of whole sky cmb maps using wavelets will be performed in a future work .",
    "since these data will be affected by non - uniform noise , the use of wavelet techniques to localize map features will be highly suitable .",
    "a semi - analytical calculation of the variance of the wavelet coefficients has been presented .",
    "the behaviour of the variance of the _ detail _ coefficients is given for a standard cdm model in the case of haar and mexican hat bases .",
    "the acoustic peaks can be noticed in the wavelet coefficient variance represented in figure 1 .",
    "moreover , these peaks are better defined for the mexican hat wavelet system since these wavelets are more localized than the haar ones .",
    "denoising of cmb maps has been carried out by using a signal - independent prescription , the sure thresholding method .",
    "the results are model independent depending only on the observed data .",
    "however , a good knowledge of the noise affecting the observed cmb maps is required . for a typical case of @xmath158 the high order _",
    "coefficients are dominated by the signal , whereas the lowest ones are noise dominated .",
    "this behaviour is due to the expected dependence of the temperature power spectrum , @xmath159 .",
    "the applied wavelet method is able to reconstruct maps with an error improvement factor between 3 and 5 and the cmb power spectrum of the denoised maps carries relative errors below @xmath160 up to @xmath3 for @xmath5 .",
    "we have also checked that sure thresholding methods are providing thresholds in agreement with the optimal ones .    for",
    "comparison wiener filter has also been applied to the simulations considered in this paper .",
    "this method reconstructs cmb maps after denoising with errors comparable to the wavelet method we propose , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "however , the @xmath161s of the denoised maps obtained applying wiener filter have relative errors larger than a factor of 2 than the relative errors of the @xmath2s obtained from the wavelet reconstructed maps in the range @xmath162 .",
    "in addition we have applied a maximum entropy method ( mem ) to the maps used in this work , with the definition of entropy given by hobson & lasenby ( 1998 ) .",
    "this method provides reconstruction errors at the same level as multiresolution wavelet methods .",
    "however , the later are easier ( not requiring iterative processes ) and faster ( @xmath163 ) to apply than mem .    a possible handicap of denoising methods based on soft thresholding of wavelet coefficients as well as other non - linear methods are the non - gaussian features introduced in the reconstructed map .",
    "however one can still detect the possible intrinsic non - gaussianity of the cmb signal by studying it in the signal plus noise map using the wavelet coefficient distribution . moreover",
    "a valid reconstruction can be obtained by applying a `` hard '' thresholding linear method as discussed in the text .    in a different work",
    ", we are studying the case of using a wavelet method based on two scales of dilation ( sanz et al .",
    "though this method has the advantage of keeping information on two different scales , for the purpose of denoising both methods give comparable results .",
    "the linear hard thresholding method is expected to perform better for 2-d wavelets than for multiresolution ones as the former works with many more resolution levels .",
    "summarizing , the main advantages of the wavelet method are : to provide local information of the contribution from different scales , to be computationally very fast @xmath163 , absence of tunning parameters and the most important , the good performance on denoising cmb maps .",
    "the best reconstruction is achieved using soft thresholding techniques . concerning the gaussianity of the signal one can apply the suggested linear method for denoising . moreover",
    ", the soft thresholding technique will provide a good reference map and power spectrum for the signal , that can be used to check the quality of other reconstructions based on linear methods .",
    "wavelets are also expected to be a very valuable tool to analyse future cmb maps as those that will be provided by future missions like map and planck .",
