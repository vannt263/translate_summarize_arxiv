    "a few hundred galaxies have their morphology measured at _ hst _",

    "however , because morphology can be determined with relative ease with _ hst _  for a very large number of galaxies , this ability allows us to explore a part of parameter space that constrains galaxy formation and evolution , and that is not yet accessible to satisfactory spectroscopic study and thus lacks kinematic data for mass measurements .",
    "the most dramatic result from these _ hst _  morphological studies in the mid  late 1990 s was that at faint fluxes , late - type / irregular galaxies completely dominate the faint blue galaxy counts ( see driver 1995a , 1995b , 1998 ; glazebrook 1995 ; odewahn 1996 ; windhorst 1996 , 1998b , 2000 ) .",
    "a number of authors interpreted this result as evidence for the existence of a population of star - forming galaxies that underwent substantial evolution since @xmath11             { \\mbox{{\\raisebox{-3pt}{{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}}}{\\llap{\\raisebox{2pt}{$<$}}}}}}3 $ ] ( ellis 1996 ; pascarelle 1996 ; driver 1998 ; abraham 1999 ) . ellipticals and early - type spirals , on the other hand , have evolved much less since @xmath11             { \\mbox{{\\raisebox{-3pt}{{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}}}{\\llap{\\raisebox{2pt}{$<$}}}}}}1 $ ] ( see driver 1995a ; lilly 1998 ; cohen 2002 ) .",
    "the photometric redshift distribution as a function of observed @xmath0-band morphological type  n(@xmath12 , type )  suggests a differential evolution of galaxies as a function of type ( driver 1998 ) , implying a gradual formation of the hubble sequence with cosmic time .    in the deepest _ hst _  fields , where morphological classifications are achievable to @xmath4             { \\mbox{{\\raisebox{-3pt}{{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}}}{\\llap{\\raisebox{2pt}{$<$}}}}}}$]26 mag ( , odewahn 1996 ; driver 1998 ) , the sampled redshift range is @xmath133 , while the bulk of the galaxies is at @xmath11             { \\mbox{{\\raisebox{-3pt}{{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}}}{\\llap{\\raisebox{2pt}{$<$}}}}}}2 $ ] .",
    "faint high redshift galaxies observed in the @xmath0-band are therefore primarily seen in the rest - frame mid - ultraviolet ( mid - uv ) wavelength range , or 20003200 .    ' '' ''    the reliability of results derived from the faint _ hst _  galaxy morphologies is therefore fundamentally limited by the uncertain rest - frame mid - uv morphology of nearby galaxies .",
    "for instance , although these faint , late - type / irregular objects resemble some classes of nearby late - type and peculiar galaxies ( , hibbard & vacca 1997 ) , they need not be physically late - type objects ; instead , they may be earlier - type galaxies that look dramatically different in the rest - frame uv . because of the wavelength dependence of nearby galaxy morphology ( especially toward the uv ) , the outcome of faint galaxy classifications will depend on the rest - frame wavelength sampled .",
    "this `` morphological k - correction '' can be quite significant , even between the @xmath14 and near - ir bands ( , knapen & beckman 1996 ) , and must be quantified in order to distinguish genuine evolutionary effects from simple band - pass shifting .",
    "the mid - uv is the optimal wavelength region for comparing the galaxies seen with _ hst _  in the @xmath0-band at @xmath11             { \\mbox{{\\raisebox{-3pt}{{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}}}{\\llap{\\raisebox{2pt}{$>$}}}}}}2",
    "$ ] to nearby samples , and to address the question of whether the numerous late - type objects that dominate the faint blue galaxy counts are truly new classes of objects , or just reflect the redshifted uv morphology of ordinary galaxies as seen nearby . in the mid - uv",
    ", one currently attains the highest resolution _ plus _ largest field - of - view ( `` fov '' ) with the _ hst_wide field and planetary camera 2 ( `` wfpc2 '' ) .    in this paper , we therefore present a systematic wfpc2 mid - uv imaging survey for a representative sample of 37 nearby galaxies .",
    "having observations for both nearby and distant objects at the _ same _ rest - frame wavelength will allow us to calibrate the dependence of morphology on rest - frame wavelength and , thus , to improve our ability to interpret the morphology of distant galaxies .",
    "such a survey will also help us better understand the _ physical _ drivers of the rest - frame mid - uv emission , , the relation between star formation ( sf ) and the global physical characteristics of galaxies , their recent star - formation history , and the role of dust absorption and scattering .",
    "observations of high redshift galaxies in the optical spectral region detect light that was emitted as uv luminosity in these galaxies rest - frames .",
    "they therefore primarily trace high surface brightness ( `` sb '' ) regions populated by high densities of young ( @xmath15             { \\mbox{{\\raisebox{-3pt}{{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}}}{\\llap{\\raisebox{2pt}{$<$}}}}}}\\!1 $ ]  gyr ) hot stellar populations . the dominance of young stellar complexes in producing uv light from star - forming galaxies was recognized from early satellite uv photometric observations ( , code & welch 1982 ; israel 1986 ) , _ iue _ far - uv spectra ( , kinney 1993 , and references therein ) , as well as imaging of a few key objects from sounding rockets ( , carruthers 1978 ; stecher 1982 ) .",
    "these results were confirmed when uv images became available from the foca balloon observations ( millard 1992 ) and the _ astro_/_uit_flights .",
    "the latter imaged @xmath2100 nearby galaxies in the far - uv ( 1500 ) and @xmath240 in the mid - uv ( 2500 ) at a resolution of @xmath23  fwhm ( bohlin 1991 ; hill 1992 ; kuchinski 2000 ; marcum 2001 ) .",
    "morphological k - corrections derived from these _ uit _  images ( and from earlier sounding rocket data ) were first investigated by bohlin ( 1991 ) and giavalisco ( 1996 ) .",
    "this , as well as the foca data , showed that galaxy morphology changes quite dramatically below 36004000 , where the hot ( young ) stellar population  located mainly in spiral arms and -regions  dominates the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and where bulges essentially disappear ( see also burgarella 2001 ; kuchinski 2001 ) .",
    "galaxies therefore often appear to be of later hubble type the further one looks into the rest - frame uv .",
    "qualitatively , this is easy to understand : in the optical / near - ir , we see the accumulated luminous phases of long - lived ( @xmath161  gyr ) stars , which emit most of their energy at longer wavelengths , whereas the mid - uv samples the star - formation rate ( sfr ) averaged over the past gyr or less .",
    "the mid - uv includes the longest wavelengths where young stars can dominate the integrated galaxy light and traces primarily presently active star forming regions , or those regions where star - formation has only recently shut down .",
    "far - uv images of nearby _ early - type _ galaxies are not always appropriate for high redshift comparisons ; they may be affected by the `` uv upturn '' , a spectral feature that is likely caused by hot , _ low - mass , old _ stars ( oconnell 1992 ; oconnell 1999 ) , and that only appears at relatively recent epochs ( @xmath11             { \\mbox{{\\raisebox{-3pt}{{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}}}{\\llap{\\raisebox{2pt}{$<$}}}}}}0.3 $ ] ; burstein 1988 ; greggio & renzini 1990 ; brown 2000 ) .",
    "however , middle - aged stellar systems can be very dim in the uv compared to either older or younger objects , as in the case in , , m32 . in galaxies of all types the far  mid - uv emission can also be modulated by dust .",
    "a number of authors have explored the effects of band - pass shifting using multicolor optical images to extrapolate to the rest - frame uv on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "this has been done both using ground - based data ( , hibbard & vacca , 1997 ; brinchmann 1998 ) , foca mid - uv images ( burgarella 2001 ) , _ uit _  far - uv images ( kuchinski 2000 ) , and _ hst _  images of galaxies at moderate redshifts ( abraham 1999 ; bouwens , broadhurst , & silk 1998 ) .",
    "the peculiarities in shape and size distributions measured in deep _",
    "hst _  surveys are found to considerably exceed the effects of band - pass shifting .",
    "while this is a robust result , these methods may not capture the full range of rest - frame uv galaxy seds , and are less suitable for making detailed comparisons with the local universe .",
    "for instance , there is considerable scatter in the mid - uv for galaxies of a given optical color .",
    "donas , milliard & laget ( 1995 ) find a 3 magnitude range in ( @xmath17 ) colors at a given @xmath18 color in a faint space - based galaxy sample , where a 2000  filter was used to measure the uv flux .",
    "this uv / optical decoupling is confirmed by the spectroscopy of treyer ( 1998 ) and implies that the true evolutionary history of galaxies can be very different from that inferred from optical data alone , and that mid - uv observations are necessary for a better understanding .",
    "recent observations of the hdf - north with _ hst_/nicmos show that some galaxies out to @xmath19 appear ` regular ' and fit into the hubble sequence in the near - ir , but look more patchy and irregular at shorter wavelengths ( dickinson 2001 ) .",
    "galaxies that look disturbed in the optical , on the other hand , in general also look very similar in the rest - frame uv .",
    "these distorted high-@xmath20 galaxies also tend to be high sb objects in the uv , forming stars at a high rate .",
    "nearby galaxies whose structure is dominated by star - formation also have similar morphologies in the rest - frame optical and mid - uv ( , conselice 2000 ) , which suggests that some nearby star - bursts galaxies may be analogs to these ` peculiar ' high-@xmath20 objects .      in this section we briefly summarize the main science goals of our project , which determine the size and properties of our wfpc2 mid - uv sample .",
    "we aim to : + ( 1 ) provide local benchmark images that we can artificially redshift to @xmath133 for quantitative comparison to the morphology and photometric properties of high redshift galaxies ; + ( 2 ) consistently classify polychromatic structures within galaxies from 0.22  with artificial neural networks .",
    "+ ( 3 ) map the spatial distribution , luminosities , and sizes of star - forming regions dominating the uv morphology , and relate these to global galaxy properties ; + ( 4 ) map the effects of dust at mid - uv wavelengths in galaxies as a function of type , inclination , and galactocentric radius ; + in the present paper , we present the benchmark mid - uv images and a qualitative discussion of our results in the context of these science goals .",
    "more quantitative studies will be presented in subsequent papers by members of our mid - uv team .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ wfpc2sampleselectionandwfpc2observations ] , we outline our survey strategy , describe the sample selection and discuss the wfpc2 observations .",
    "we also discuss the data processing and calibration .",
    "our wfpc2 mid - uv and ground - based optical images are presented in ",
    "[ wfpc2miduv - opticalatlas ] , where we also discuss individual objects .",
    "we describe the general trends in galaxy morphology as observed from the mid - uv through the optical in   [ discussionofgeneraltrends ] . and in   [ conclusions ] , we present our main conclusions from this data set .",
    "with the _ hst _  wide field and planetary camera 2 ( `` wfpc2 '' ) , we have obtained images of 37 nearby galaxies through one or , whenever possible , two wide - band mid - uv filters below the atmospheric cutoff .",
    "these filters are f300w ( @xmath21 ; @xmath22  fwhm ) and f255w ( @xmath23 ; @xmath24  fwhm ) , which provide reasonable red - leak suppression .",
    "the f255w , f300w , and the johnson @xmath25 and @xmath14 filters are approximately equally spaced in energy ( , in the logarithm of the wavelength ) , and so add significantly to the existing ground - based optical  near - ir color baseline .",
    "since the _ hst_/wfpc2 system throughput is @xmath22.0% in f300w and @xmath20.5% in f255w ( biretta 2001 ; appendix 1 ) , we can only detect the highest sb , bluest objects in f255w in a single _ hst _  orbit and so have selected our sample accordingly .",
    "the mid - uv is the longest wavelength where younger stars can dominate the integrated galaxy light , and therefore the regime of choice to measure the sfr averaged over @xmath26             { \\mbox{{\\raisebox{-3pt}{{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}}}{\\llap{\\raisebox{2pt}{$<$}}}}}}1 $ ]  gyr .",
    "we have observed _ all _ selected galaxies through the f300w filter , spending no more than one full orbit per galaxy . in that same orbit a short exposure through a red filter ( f814w )",
    "is taken for adequate red - leak correction ( see  [ redleak ] ) .",

    ", a galaxy can be detected out to @xmath39@xmath40 with wfpc2 in one orbit with sufficiently high s / n to allow morphological features to be recognized .",
    "the bias toward selecting higher sb galaxies can be addressed as in driver ( 1995b ) . in short , selecting high sb galaxies as the nearby template objects is not an overriding concern , since the high - redshift samples are similarly biased ( or more so ) in favor of high sb galaxies due to the severe cosmological sb dimming . for monochromatic light ,",
    "sb - dimming is proportional to @xmath41 , with @xmath42 the spectral index if the object spectrum were to be represented by a power - law sed .",
    "the resolution of _ hst _ s optical telescope assembly ( ota ) in f300w is @xmath2@xmath43 .",
    "this is somewhat larger than _ hst _ s formal diffraction limit at 2930  ( @xmath44 ) , which does nt set in until longward of 4000  due to mirror micro - roughness .",
    "the wfpc2 wfc pixel size is @xmath45/pixel .",
    "hence , because the uv images are already severely undersampled , on - chip rebinning to gain sb - sensitivity is not an option .",
    "instead , where needed , we can rebin the images in the post - processing stage to measure the outskirts to fainter sb - levels .",

    "the nucleus has been placed on wfpc2 s wf3 ccd , near pixel @xmath49 , so that both the wf2 and wf4 ccds maximally sample the galaxies outskirts , allowing optimal subtraction of any sky - background when mosaicing the four wfpc2 ccds .",
    "for some of the larger galaxies and for galaxies in pairs or small groups , we center the object(s ) in another part of the wfpc2 fov , or constrain the _",
    "hst_roll angle ( `` orient '' ) to assure that the largest possible portion of the galaxy or galaxy group is observed .",
    "part of the galaxy sample is located in the _ hst _  continuous viewing zone ( cvz ) , , at @xmath50 , where objects are observable for an entire _ hst _  orbit , typically doubling the available integration time . for any such galaxies , we were able to obtain f255w as well as f300w images without the cost of an extra _ hst_orbit .",
    "we select the sample to maximize the fraction of galaxies in the cvz .",
    "since the zodiacal background reflects the color of the sun , the sky - background will be darker in the f255w filter ( @xmath224.525.0 @xmath38 ) than in the f300w filter ( @xmath224.0 @xmath38 ) , partly compensating for the lower sensitivity in f255w .",
    "observations in the cvz may suffer from higher sky - background levels due to the earth s limb ( williams 1996 ) .",
    "we minimize the probability of excessive sky - levels by interspersing the exposures in the different filters using the sequence : f814w , f255w , f300w , f255w , f300w , f814w , f255w , and f300w .",
    "this sequence ensures that never more than one f255w or f300w exposure is taken close to the earth s limb in a full cvz orbit , and also minimizes the number of fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) motions needed to create a pointing dither - pattern . for non - cvz targets we use the sequence : f814w , f300w , f300w , and f814w , to push the f300w exposures farthest from the earth s limb .",
    "in selecting our galaxy sample we aimed to take advantage of as much pre - existing ground- and space - based uv , optical and near - ir images as possible .",
    "in particular , high priority was given to galaxies that have been observed with _",
    "uit _  in the far - uv ( 1500 ) and obeyed the sb and size criteria (   [ strategy - predictedsb ] and   [ strategy - sizeplacement ] ) .",

    "the mean ( median ) seeing over all ground - based images is @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) ( 1-@xmath79 ) .",
    "this rather large average image - fwhm is due to the majority of vatt images having a focus component in their psf as a result of the rapid change of focus with temperature in this f/1 telescope ( for details , see taylor 2002 ) .",
    "even with fwhm @xmath2  20 , these ground - based images are quite suitable for our current purpose of galaxy surface photometry in @xmath80 .",
    "several of the galaxies in the present sample have been observed with _ hst _  in filters other than f300w and f255w , or with instruments other than wfpc2 .",
    "maoz ( 1996 ) , for example , imaged the central @xmath81 in 110 nearby galaxies in the mid - uv ( 2300 ) using the faint object camera ( foc ) .",
    "the red - leak in the foc mid - uv filters , however , is more severe ( @xmath224% ; keel & windhorst 1993 ) than that in the wfpc2 filters ( @xmath827% ; see  [ redleak ] ) , and the fov is much smaller .",
    "sixteen of our objects have been observed in other wfpc2 filters before  generally in a heterogeneous mixture of filters : f170w ( far - uv ) , f336w , f439w , f555w , f606w , f702w , and/or some additional f814w images .",
    "these data are summarized in table  3 . in the archival wfpc2 exposures ,",
    "the galaxy nucleus was often placed in the planetary camera ( pc ) , which due to its smaller pixel size is less suited for accurate surface - photometry .",
    "also , for galaxies @xmath21  in extent , more of a galaxy tends to be lost outside wfpc2 s fov when its nucleus is placed in the pc .",
    "we will study these archival wfpc2 images in the other filters , where appropriate , in future papers .    where archival nicmos images in the f110m / f110w , f160w or f222 m filters are available ( gto  7218 , pi : rieke , see , alonso - herrero 2000 ; gto  7219 , pi : scoville , see scoville 2000 ;",

    "photometric calibration was done using the stsdas on - the - fly - reduction ( otfr ) routines as available since summer 2000 .",
    "custom calibration , in general , does not significantly improve upon the stsci wfpc2 pipeline , owing to the significant work that went into building and improving that pipeline .",
    "the otfr takes into account the latest improvements in knowledge of the instrument every time one retrieves data from the _ hst _  archive .",
    "because the mid - uv images have extremely low sky - background levels , the background subtraction is limited by the quality of the bias and dark current removal .",
    "it is therefore important that the very best possible biases and latest dark - current and hot - pixel maps are used .",
    "we paid close attention to whether the correct dark - frames were used when observations were taken near the monthly warm - up of wfpc2 ( to decontaminate the optics and anneal many of the new hot - pixels ) .",
    "the otfr uses the best available super - dark taken after the relevant science images , but before the next decontamination .",
    "hence , it is conservative in nature  repairing more pixels than needed , but never too few .",
    "we re - ran the otfr on all data one month after the last images for this project were taken ( in april 2001 ) to incorporate the latest knowledge on the wfpc2 data .",
    "the difference between this second run and the first was very small , but went in the direction of removing a more appropriate ( smaller ) number of pixels deemed `` hot '' .",
    "we co - added all images in the same filter after registration using integer pixel shifts .",
    "our in - house idl routine ` stcombine ` ( pascarelle 1998 ; cohen 2002 ) was used to optimally remove the signal induced by the many cosmic - ray ( cr ) hits .",
    "this routine , optimized for the low signal domain , applies a one - sided 2-@xmath79 rejection in creating the final stacked image ( following windhorst 1994a ) .",
    "the zodiacal sky - background at the north ecliptic pole is @xmath224.0 @xmath38  in f300w ( windhorst 1994b , 1998a ) and @xmath224.7 @xmath38 in f255w ( cornett 1994 ) , and is as low in the sunlit part of the orbit as it is in the occulted part ( unless the angle to the earth s limb becomes small ) .",
    "since our wfpc2 mid - uv images are read - noise limited , the resulting 1-orbit 1-@xmath79 sb - sensitivity is @xmath83 @xmath38  in f300w and @xmath84 @xmath38  in f255w on a per pixel basis .",
    "the relation between the detected sb - level and the s / n in a pixel is given by : @xmath85 and @xmath86 for f300w and f255w , respectively .",
    "these mid - uv sb - limits are consistent with the values expected from the cycle 56 images in f410 m and f450w ( pascarelle 1996 , odewahn 1996 , windhorst 1998a ) and the relatively red color of the zodiacal sky - background .",
    "taking into the account the @xmath87 sb - dimming and the typical @xmath88 color of galaxies at @xmath132 , the sb - sensitivity reached in the present data matches that achieved for typical faint @xmath4             { \\mbox{{\\raisebox{-3pt}{{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}}}{\\llap{\\raisebox{2pt}{$<$}}}}}}26 $ ] galaxies seen in deep _ hst",
    "_  images .",
    "the 1-orbit 3-@xmath79 point source sensitivity is @xmath89 mag in f300w and @xmath224.5 mag in f255w .",
    "hence , many of the galaxies in our sample are resolved into their brightest star - forming regions and  most likely  into their ob associations and young star clusters .",
    "this is not true , however , for most of the merging / interacting galaxies that were selected into our sample from the sample of hibbard ( 2002 ) . because these systems are relatively rare , they tend to be 23 times more distant than the bulk of our sample ( see table  1 , col .  14 ) , and so are not resolved into stars .",
    "the f300w filter has a significant red - leak , causing a fraction of an object s flux longward of 4000  to be detected in this mid - uv filter .",
    "fig .  3.10 of the wfpc2 handbook ( biretta 2001 ) shows that red - leak portion of the @xmath90 curve of the f300w filter resembles the throughput curve of the f814w filter which transmits mostly photons in the 70009000  range .",
    "table  3.13 of the wfpc2 handbook suggests that the red - leak is generally no more than 5% of the total f300w flux for stellar populations dominated by stars of spectral type k3v or earlier , although it can be as much as 1050% of the total f300w flux for stellar populations dominated by m0m8v stars .",
    "hence , even for elliptical galaxies with k - star spectra , the red - leak is expected to be relatively small , and for late - type galaxies dominated by young hot stellar populations it should be almost negligible .    for realistic galaxy seds , eskridge ( 2002a )",
    "find that the red - leak is typically 57% of the total f300w flux , and never exceeds 10% of the f300w flux , not even in the reddest galaxy bulges .",
    "we verified this for several red galaxies in our sample by subtracting a fraction of the f814w images from the f300w images , after appropriately rescaling with the relative exposure time , and making sure both images were registered the same way .",
    "this fraction of the subtracted f814w image amounted to 7% of the total f300w flux in the brightest region of the galaxy bulge that is presumed to be dominated by g8-k3 stars ( following the red - leak as modeled by eskridge 2002a ) .",
    "we found that for the redder stellar populations in those images no noticeable additional structure was introduced in our f300w images at the locations of the brightest f814w flux . to illustrate this ,",
    "a very red star is seen just above the center of both edge - on galaxies eso033-g22 and ic  4394 in the f814w images of fig . 3.19 and 3.20 . for ic  4394 , fig .",
    "4.20 shows how red this star is , where it is seen just south of the galaxy center .",
    "these stars are saturated in the f814w images of both galaxies , and at the corresponding locations in the ( non - red - leak corrected ) f300w images of fig .",
    "3.193.20 , only a very faint red - leak flux is seen .",
    "these worst case examples show that the apparent f300w morphology of any of our galaxies would not be significantly affected by the red - leak in a few of the very reddest and brightest galaxy areas in the f814w images .",
    "such areas would have to be significantly saturated in our f814w exposures to generate significant red - leak in the f300w images , and none of our targeted galaxies were saturated anywhere in the f814w images .",
    "hence , for the current qualitative presentation of the mid - uv images , and given that our sample is biased toward the bluer galaxies , we have thus not corrected the images presented in the mid - uv atlas of   [ wfpc2miduv - opticalatlas ] for the small contamination by red - leak in the brightest and reddest areas .",
    "for accurate quantitative measurements of galaxy properties we will subtract the red - leak in future papers where necessary ( , eskridge 2002a ) .",
    "this will be done together with the determination of pixel - to - pixel seds for each galaxy , in case there are subtle dependencies of the red - leak on the red sed . however , to first order there should be no such dependency , since galaxies of all spectral types show remarkably little change in their relative sed s between 7000 - 9000 .      as we expect these data to be of use beyond the scope of our immediate science goals",
    ", we will make all images available to the community in digital form when this paper goes to press .",
    "we do this , even though the photometric zero - points for part of the ground - based images are not yet established .",
    "we will update the fits headers as new photometry becomes available ( see also taylor 2002 ) . hence , the fits headers in the public data base will override any values currently listed in table  2 .",

    "our _ hst _  and ground - based images show the type listed in the rc3 to be incorrect , for various reasons explained below .",
    "most of our cycle  9 mid - uv galaxies , except for some of their outskirts , fit inside a single wfpc2 ccd , and so the current paper shows only a single wfpc2 ccd in most figures 3.nn4.nn .",
    "however , a few edge - on galaxies are too large to fit on a single wfpc2 ccd . for these galaxies , the relevant parts of a full wfpc2 ccd _ mosaic _",
    "are therefore shown instead in the current paper ( see ugc  10043 in fig .  3.16 ) .",
    "since the number of pixels we can display in this manner on one apj page does not do full justice to the high quality of the wfpc2 data , we will display in a sequel paper ( odewahn 2002b ) the multi - color wfpc2 mosaics in full - page size for the two remaining large edge - on galaxies ( , eso  033@xmath92g022 in fig .  3.19 and ic  4394 in fig .  3.20 ) and possibly for a few other large objects , as needed .",
    "this sequel paper will dither all wfpc2 mosaics for our sample of 37 objects , and do a detailed sky - subtraction across the ccd s , which is needed for reliable determination of the mosaic - wide multi - color light - profiles , as well as the subsequent quantitative analysis .",

    "the small nuclear dust - lane seen by comparing the f814w and mid - uv images of almost all mid  late - type spiral galaxies in our sample may then be involved in feeding the inner accretion disk ( which is not visible in our _ hst _",

    "some edge - on galaxies are very faint in f300w when compared to f814w ( ugc  10043 [   3.16 ] and eso  033@xmath92g22 [   3.19 ] ) , others emit / transmit significantly more in f300w ( ugc  06697 [   3.17 ] and ic  3949 [   3.18 ] ) , while ic  4393 (   3.20 ) is an intermediate case .",
    "all show a f300w / f814w ratio increasing from the inside out , as expected for a decreasing dust content from the inside out , and/or a strong radial gradient in the stellar population , if we assume that the dust and light sources are well mixed ( , the light sources are not preferentially located in front of most of the dust ; see , , jansen 1994 ; witt & gordon 1996 ; kuchinski 1998 ) .",
    "the late - type and irregular galaxies imaged are a heterogeneous mixture .",
    "the majority of these galaxies show a f300w morphology that is similar to that in f814w .",
    "important differences are seen , however , due to recognizable dust - lanes or pockets blocking out f300w light ( , ugc  06697 [   3.17 ] ; ngc  5253 [   3.27 ] ; ugc  09855 [   3.30 ] ; mrk  66 [   3.32 ] ; arp  299 [   3.34 ]",

    "dust is visible in pockets , holes or bubbles , perhaps due to supernova - induced outflows or outflows fueled by bright star - forming regions , such as seen in m  82 at _ hst _  resolution ( de grijs 2001 ) .",
    "some late - type galaxies are physically smaller galaxies with what appears to be the beginning of spiral structure ( mcg+03@xmath9230@xmath92071 and mcg+06@xmath9224@xmath92047 [ ",

    "star - formation `` ridges '' are commonly seen in the late - type galaxies , as well as hot stars or star - clusters that are particularly conspicuous in the mid - uv ( f300w and/or f255w ) .",
    "a few late - type galaxies would be classified significantly different when observed in the mid - uv than in the f814w passband ( mcg+06@xmath9224@xmath92047 [   3.22 ] , ugc  05626 [   3.29 ] , ugc  09855 [   3.30 ] ) , especially when observed under less than perfect atmospheric seeing conditions . a quantitative discussion of the classification changes as a function of rest - frame wavelength will be given by odewahn ( 2002b ) .      the majority of the peculiars and interacting galaxies ( ugc  05189 , arp  299 , ugc  06527 , ugc  08335 , ic  2184 , and arp  239 [   3.333.38 ] ) show a f300w morphology that is similar to that in f814w .",
    "several mergers have spectacular dust - lanes that thread along with the spiral arms , which are tidally distorted during the interaction ( ugc  08335 ; arp  239 ) , while most others have absorption in apparently random locations associated with a star - burst .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "images are in general not sufficiently deep nor do they sample a sufficiently large area on the sky to capture the lower sb features ( , low - sb tails and other large tidal features , faint extended disks or halos ) that are well imaged on the ground - based photographic plates which were originally used to classify these objects .",
    "the inner regions of these objects reveal a wealth of structure in the _ hst _  images , but often are almost entirely burned out or blurred on these ground - based images .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "images do thus not necessarily reflect the distribution of the extended ( evolved ) stellar population .",
    "this is particularly true of the interacting systems , where tidal forces first and most easily affect the outer regions of the participants .",
    "because interacting galaxies have both a disturbed distribution of old stars in their outskirts _ and _ an irregular distribution of dust and young star - forming regions in their inner parts , their peculiar morphology is maintained over a range of spatial scales and surface brightnesses .",
    "as such , the morphological k - corrections derived from this sample mostly apply to the high - sb inner regions of these galaxies .",
    "however , these _ are _ the appropriate morphological k - corrections to be applied to studies of high - redshift galaxies , where cosmological sb - dimming similarly selects the high - sb regions as do our short _ hst",
    "_  exposures .",
    "more statistics are needed to cover all late - types , and the major dynamical stages of peculiars and mergers , as these are likely the dominant population at high redshift .",
    "we will pursue such objects further through an _ hst _",
    "snap - shot program of late - type / irregular and peculiar galaxies in cycle 10 .",
    "in order to delineate the morphology of galaxies as observed in their rest - frame mid - ultraviolet , we have carried out a systematic imaging survey with _ hst_/wfpc2 of 37 nearby galaxies",
    "the _ mid - uv _ filter f300w ( centered at 2930 ) , as well as in the @xmath0-band ( filter f814w centered at 8230 ) .",
    "these mid - uv images will be useful to more reliably classify the numerous faint galaxy images seen with _ hst _  in deep @xmath0-band surveys at high redshifts ( @xmath1192 ) .",
    "eleven galaxies located in the _ hst _  continuous viewing zone were also imaged in the f255w filter ( centered at 2550 ) .    our sample",
    "is carefully selected for size and surface brightness , and included galaxies of small enough radius and high enough predicted mid - uv sb to be observable with _ hst_/wfpc2 in one orbit .",
    "together with 17 galaxies imaged in f300w available in the _ hst _  archive , our survey covers a wide range of hubble types and inclinations .",
    "complementary data at other wavelengths are available for our galaxy sample : most objects have ground - based @xmath80 images , some have @xmath120 images , and 15 have far - uv images from the _ astro_/_uit _  missions .",
    "mid - uv images ( 20003200 ) have been the missing ingredient thus far .    in summary",
    ", our mid - uv imaging data base shows that in galaxies where star - formation is sufficiently pronounced , it can dominate the morphology from the mid - uv though the optical , resulting in very little change in morphology from the uv to the red . however , when stellar populations older than about 1  gyr produce most of the optical light , we see changes in morphology between the optical  where these stars tend to produce relatively regular structures due to the effects of orbital mixing within the galaxies  and the mid - uv  where younger stars whose locations still reflect the distribution of their birthplaces .",
    "an additional complication is introduced by the presence of dust obscuration .",
    "dust lanes or clouds that are nearly transparent in the visible can be opaque in the mid - uv , thereby changing the apparent morphology .",
    "\\(1 ) early - type galaxies ( t=@xmath121 to 0 ) show a significant change in sb in going from the mid - uv to the red , reflecting their relative paucity of a young stellar population .",
    "some early types appear rather dim in the mid - uv due to significant central dust lanes , while others show mostly a small blue nuclear feature in the mid - uv .",
    "three ellipticals become nearly point sources in the mid - uv ( , dominated by liner s , seyferts ) .",
    "this is in part due to our sample selection , which required the objects to have high ( predicted ) mid - uv sb .",
    "but it leads us to wonder to what extent the apparently strong cosmological evolution of weak agn in early - type galaxies is due to the morphological k - correction plus sb - dimming , which causes the surrounding uv - faint early - type host to no longer be visible at higher redshifts . in summary ,",
    "high sb early - type galaxies in the optical show a variety of morphologies in the mid - uv that _ can _ lead to a different morphological classification , although not necessarily always as later  type .",
    "the often rather peculiar mid - uv morphology of early - type galaxies is generally quite different than that of the real late - type galaxies as seen in the mid - uv , as discussed below .",
    "\\(2 ) mid - type spiral galaxies ( t=15 ) and star - forming galaxies can appear as later morphological types in the mid - uv , as _ astro_/_uit _  has shown primarily in the far - uv .",
    "about half of the mid - type spirals in the optical appear as later morphological types in the mid - uv , but not all mid - type spiral galaxies do look dramatically different in the mid - uv .",
    "one mid - type spiral , ngc  6782 (   3.15 ) , shows a spectacular resonance ring full of hot stars in the f255w and f300w filters .",
    "the mid - uv images show a considerable range in the scale and sb of individual star - forming regions .",
    "a comparison of f300w to f814w images yields good sensitivity to dust features . almost without exception ,",
    "the mid - type spirals in our sample have their small nuclear bulges bisected by a dust - lane , which is often connected to the inner spiral arm structure .",
    "\\(3 ) the late - type , irregular , peculiar , and merging galaxies ( t=611 ) in our sample show diverse properties in the mid - uv .",
    "the majority of these galaxies show a f300w morphology that is similar to that in f814w , but with important differences due to recognizable dust - features absorbing the f300w light , and hot stars , star - clusters , or star - formation `` ridges '' that are better visible in the mid - uv .",
    "less than a third of galaxies classified as late - type in the optical show significantly different structures in the mid - uv to result in a different classification .    in conclusion ,",
    "our _ hst _  mid - uv survey of nearby galaxies suggests that it is more likely to misclassify true early  mid type galaxies in the rest - frame mid - uv as later types , while known late - type galaxies are less likely to be misclassified ( as earlier types ) in the mid - uv .",
    "this is because _ truly _ late - type galaxies are dominated by young and hot stars in all filters from the mid - uv to the red , and so have to first order the same morphology and a very small morphological k - correction in general . however ,",
    "early - type galaxies ( ellipticals and early - type spirals ) _ can , although do not have to _ look significantly different when one goes from the rest - frame mid - uv to the optical - red part of the spectrum .",
    "classification of faint galaxies in the rest - frame mid - uv will thus likely result in some fraction of early  mid type galaxies being misclassified as later - types , probably a larger fraction than vice versa .",
    "but it is unlikely that this morphological k - correction can explain all of the faint blue galaxy excess as misclassified earlier - type galaxies . and",
    "the morphological k - correction can not explain the slight excess of early  mid type galaxies at faint magnitudes ( @xmath68             { \\mbox{{\\raisebox{-3pt}{{\\ensuremath{\\sim}}}}{\\llap{\\raisebox{2pt}{$>$}}}}}}24 $ ] mag ) with respect to passively evolving models , as found by odewahn ( 1996 ) and cohen ( 2002 ) , since the main misclassification error goes in the opposite direction . instead , our mid - uv survey seems to support the conclusion of cohen ( 2002 ) that the number of faint galaxies is larger than the non - evolving predictions _ for all galaxy types _ , but more significantly so for the later types .",
    "cohen ( 2002 ) give a possible explanation of this finding in terms of hierarchical formation models in a lambda - dominated universe .",
    "to address these issues further quantitatively , we will in a sequel paper use the fourier decomposition method of odewahn ( 1995 , 2002a ) , where we will quantify the morphological k - correction based on each galaxy s mid - uv photometric parameters as a function of rest - frame wavelength and observed type .",
    "our goal is to use the current _ hst_mid - uv sample to quantify the morphological k - correction , and apply it to a large complete sample of faint _ hst _  galaxies with know photometric redshifts to get reliable and consistent rest - frame classifications .",
    "these will then be used to compute the redshift distribution as a function of morphological type , which will help delineate the formation and evolution of galaxies along the hubble sequence ( see driver 1998 ) .",

    "<S> we present a systematic imaging survey of 37 nearby galaxies observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> ( _ hst _ ) wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in the mid - uv f300w filter , centered at 2930 , as well as in the @xmath0-band ( f814w ) filter at 8230 . </S>",
    "<S> eleven of these galaxies were also imaged in the f255w filter , centered at 2550 . </S>",
    "<S> our sample is carefully selected to include galaxies of sufficiently small radius and high predicted mid - uv surface brightness to be detectable with wfpc2 in one orbit , and covers a wide range of hubble types and inclinations . the mid - uv ( 20003200 ) spans the gap between ground - based @xmath1 images , which are available or were acquired for the current study , and far - uv images available from the _ astro_/_uit _  missions for 15 galaxies in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> the first qualitative results from our study are : + ( 1 ) early - type galaxies show a significant decrease in surface brightness going from the red to the mid - uv , reflecting the absence of a dominant young stellar population , and in some cases the presence of significant ( central ) dust lanes . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies that are early - types in the optical show a variety of morphologies in the mid - uv that can lead to a different morphological classification , although not necessarily as later  type . some early - type galaxies become dominated by a blue nuclear feature or a point source in the mid - uv , , due to the presence of a seyfert nucleus or a liner . </S>",
    "<S> this is in part due to our mid - uv surface brightness selection , but it also suggests that part of the strong apparent evolution of weak agn in early - type galaxies may be due to surface brightness dimming of their uv - faint stellar population , which renders the early - type host galaxies invisible at intermediate to higher redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 2 ) about half of the mid - type spiral and star - forming galaxies appear as a later morphological type in the mid - uv , as _ astro_/_uit </S>",
    "<S> _  also found primarily in the far - uv . </S>",
    "<S> sometimes these differences are dramatic ( , ngc  6782 shows a spectacular ring of hot stars in the mid - uv ) . however , not all mid - type spiral galaxies look significantly different in the mid - uv . </S>",
    "<S> their mid - uv images show a considerable range in the scale and surface brightness of individual star - forming regions . almost without exception , </S>",
    "<S> the mid - type spirals in our sample have their small bulges bisected by a dust - lane , which often appears to be connected to the inner spiral arm structure . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 3 ) the majority of the heterogeneous subset of late - type , irregular , peculiar and merging galaxies display f300w morphologies that are similar to those seen in f814w , but with important differences due to recognizable dust - features absorbing the bluer light , and due to hot stars , star - clusters , and star - formation `` ridges '' that are bright in the mid - uv . </S>",
    "<S> less than one third of the galaxies classified as late - type in the optical appears sufficiently different in the mid - uv to result in a different classification . </S>",
    "<S> + our _ hst _  mid - uv survey of nearby galaxies shows that when observed in the rest - frame mid - uv early- to mid - type galaxies are more likely to be misclassified as later types than late - type galaxies are to be misclassified as earlier types . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the later type galaxies are dominated by the same young and hot stars in all filters from the mid - uv to the red , and so have a smaller `` morphological k - correction '' than true earlier type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the morphological k - correction can thus explain part , but certainly not all of the excess faint blue late - type galaxies seen in deep _ hst _  fields . </S>"
