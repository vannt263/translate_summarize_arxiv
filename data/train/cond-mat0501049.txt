    "sputter erosion @xcite , the bombardment of solid target surfaces with ionized particles to remove or to detach target material , has a long tradition in physics as an experimental technique to clean , smooth , or appropriately prepare solid surfaces . the preparation of on the nanoscale perfectly flat surfaces , however , does not seem to be possible .",
    "this is because various surface roughening and smoothing processes compete during the sputtering process and can lead to self - organized pattern formation of the eroded surface morphology .",
    "depending on the target material , temperature , ion beam energy , angle of incidence and various other parameters , one generically observes the development of rough surfaces , cellular patterns and , in particular under oblique incidence of the ion beam , the formation of more or less regular ripple patterns . for an overview on recent experimental results and theoretical approaches using continuum modeling",
    "we refer to makeev et al .",
    "@xcite and valbusa et al .",
    "@xcite .    during the last five years , however , spectacularly novel experimental results have been reported by facsko et al @xcite showing that gasb and insb semiconductor targets eroded by ar@xmath0 ions under normal incidence can develop into a rather well ordered surface morphology with basically hexagonally arranged dot structures .",
    "similar results have been subsequently reported by gago et al@xcite for si targets under normal incidence and , more generally , by frost et al .",
    "@xcite for rotated inp , insb and gasb targets under oblique incidence ( where as function of the inclination angle a variety of other patterns have also been observed ) . to theoretically explain the hexagonal ordering and taking advantage of earlier work by elder et al .",
    "@xcite ( cf . also an even earlier study@xcite on this subject ) , facsko et al .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested a ( stochastically extended ) stabilized or damped kuramoto - sivashinsky ( ks ) equation for the dynamics of the surface height @xmath1 .",
    "this equation is given by @xmath2 and might be considered as a useful continuum model for the ion - beam erosion under normal incidence since it can successfully reproduce the experimentally observed hexagonally ordered dot - type structures .",
    "the physical origin of the six terms on the rhs of eq.([skse ] ) is attributed to constant erosion velocity @xmath3 , dissipation , effective surface tension ( bradley - harper mechanism @xcite ) , thermal and erosion induced diffusion , tilt dependent sputtering yield , and some stochasticity of the erosion process , respectively ( cf . the original study @xcite for details ) .",
    "previous attempts@xcite based on the ( standard ) ks equation , i.e. without the term @xmath4 , have reproduced cellular patterns without convincing evidence of a regular hexagonal ordering .",
    "as noted by facsko et al . at the end of their paper @xcite , there are two basic problems with the applicability of eq.([skse ] ) to erosion processes since , as eq.([skse ] ) stands , it violates the translation invariance in the erosion direction and , moreover , the physical meaning of the dissipation term @xmath4 is not directly obvious .",
    "facsko et al .",
    "@xcite briefly argued that ( i ) translational invariance can be restored by assuming that @xmath4 has to be replaced by @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the erosion depth averaged over the sample area and ( ii ) that the term @xmath5 might be interpreted as an approximation of a newly suggested redeposition effect of the sputtered target particles . due to the nonlocal character of this term , however , the systematic connection between this nonlocally extended damped ks equation and eq.([skse ] ) is far from being obvious and the main reason for our paper .",
    "first , we argue on general grounds , by using balance considerations , symmetries and allowing for nonlocal dependencies , what the simplest functional form of the spatio - temporal dynamics of the morphology of ion sputtered surfaces under _ normal _ incidence of the ions might be , if nonlocal terms as suggested by facsko et al .",
    "@xcite are taken into account .",
    "second , we show that the resulting non - local model equation can be mapped to the damped ks equation by the use of a temporally nonlocal transformation . by",
    "that we show how the stabilized ks equation suggested by facsko et al .",
    "@xcite systematically fits into the theoretical framework of a continuum description of eroded surfaces obeying all desired invariances .",
    "third , we discuss in detail the subtle interplay between potentially nonlocal terms in the evolution equation for the eroding surfaces and the role of the ks - nonlinearity @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we also investigate some consequences on the general evolution dynamics in these equations .",
    "the starting point of our investigation is the general , stochastically extended balance equation for the spatio - temporal evolution of the eroded surface morphology @xmath8 measured perpendicularly to the initially flat target surface with coordinates @xmath9 . assuming that the particle density at the surface of the target material can be basically considered as being constant @xcite , such a balance equation reads quite generally @xcite    @xmath10    and expresses the fact that temporal changes of the erosion depth @xmath8 arise from two main contributions : ( i ) the detachment of target material leading to an in general inhomogenous and non - stationary , appropriately rescaled flux of eroded particles @xmath11 ( given by the number of eroded particles per time and surface area divided by the particle density ) and ( ii ) the local rearrangements of the particles at the surface leading to a relaxational current @xmath12 along the surface .",
    "note that this balance only accounts for the target particles .",
    "the underlying driving of the erosion process , the flux of eroding ions @xmath13 , enters indirectly into such a description : all terms on the right hand side of ( [ eq1 ] ) depend on @xmath13 in a way that they vanish if the sputtering process is turned off , @xmath14 .",
    "note that thermally activated processes that do not depend on @xmath13 and might lead to a further smoothing of the surface after the sputtering has been stopped are not taken into account .",
    "the spatio - temporal fluctuations @xmath15 entering in ( [ eq1 ] ) mimic some stochasticity present in the erosion process and are usually assumed to be gaussian white , i.e. having an average @xmath16 and a covariance @xmath17 .",
    "considering periodic boundary conditions on an appropriately chosen , large enough sample area of the size @xmath18 and introducing the spatial average @xmath19 ( being generally not equivalent to a stochastic average if taken on a finite area ) , the evolution of the mean erosion depth @xmath20 develops according to @xmath21 which directly leads to @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the spatial average of the initial condition @xmath24 ( which is usually set to zero under the assumption of an initially flat target surface ) .",
    "already at this stage it is clear that the mean erosion depth @xmath25 is , in general , not a linear function in @xmath26 implying a constant erosion velocity , but a rather complicated function that integrates over the history of the stochasticity and of the eroded flux .    in order to specify the admissible functional forms of the right hand side of eq.([eq1 ] ) , we reconsider the three fundamental symmetry requirements that are considered to be basic for the spatio - temporal evolution of surface morphologies @xcite : ( i ) no dependence of ( [ eq1 ] ) on the specific choice of the origin of time implying invariance of ( [ eq1 ] ) under translation in time , ( ii ) no dependence of ( [ eq1 ] ) on the specific choice of the origin of the coordinate system implying invariance of ( [ eq1 ] ) under translation in the direction perpendicular to the erosion direction , and ( iii ) no dependence of ( [ eq1 ] ) on the specific choice of the origin of the @xmath1-axis implying invariance of ( [ eq1 ] ) under translation in growth direction .",
    "these symmetry requirements exclude any _ explicit _ dependence of @xmath27 and @xmath11 on the time @xmath26 , the spatial position @xmath28 and the erosion depth @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "following facsko et al.s argument @xcite , however , an implicite functional dependence on @xmath29 and on the spatial derivatives of @xmath1 is still admissable .",
    "consequently , the detachment contribution in ( [ eq1 ] ) is quite generally given by @xmath30 $ ] where @xmath31 $ ] is the short hand notation for any derivative or combination of derivatives of @xmath1 being compatible with the scalar character of @xmath11 or @xmath1 .",
    "to proceed we",
    "( i ) additionally apply invariance under rotation and reflection in the plane perpendicular to the erosion direction ( which is suggested by the experimentally observed amorphorization of the target surface due to the erosion ) , ( ii ) expand the height dependent term @xmath32 of @xmath11 in a power series in @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath33 , and ( iii ) perform a gradient expansion of the contribution @xmath34 of @xmath11 that solely contains derivatives of @xmath1 .",
    "the latter implies that the lowest order terms ( up to forth order in @xmath35 and second order in @xmath1 ) are given by @xmath36 , @xmath7 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 $ ] . keeping only the lowest order contributions ,",
    "the erosion flux is determined by @xmath41\\nonumber\\\\                & \\ ; & + \\ , o\\left(\\nabla^4,h^2,(h-\\overline h)^2\\right ) \\label{trafo1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 being a constant and negative since this part of the flux is antiparallel to the erosion direction . the lowest order possible mixing term between @xmath43 and @xmath29 that could appear in ( [ trafo1 ] ) is given by @xmath44 and will be omitted since it can be considered as a higher order contribution to the term proportional to @xmath45 or @xmath46 in ( [ trafo1 ] ) .",
    "the functional form of the term representing the relaxational currents at the surface , @xmath27 in ( [ eq1 ] ) remains to be specified .",
    "following facsko et al .",
    "@xcite , we suppose @xmath47 .",
    "this mimics the tendency of surface particles to reach energetically more favorable positions with a positive curvature @xmath48 and , therefore , leads to a current @xmath49 .",
    "combining all ingredients and renaming the entering coefficients @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , yields a minimal functional form for the evolution of the erosion depth under the afore - mentioned restrictions that is given by @xmath54 the functional form of eq.([trafo2 ] ) looks like the equation suggested by facsko et al@xcite that follows after their ad - hoc replacement of @xmath4 by @xmath55 in the damped ks equation .",
    "note however , that the spatially constant part of the flux @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath42 , is , in general , not given by the mean constant erosion velocity since the latter is not constant during the course of the evolution .",
    "next we transform eq.([trafo2 ] ) into a coordinate system that moves with the mean erosion depth @xmath20 , @xmath56 with @xmath57 being the local erosion profile that obviously fulfills @xmath58 and @xmath59 for all times @xmath26 .",
    "the transformation ( [ trafo3 ] ) also guarantees that the invariance under translation in erosion direction @xmath60 with @xmath61 being an arbitrary constant ( that only needs to hold in the coordinate system that is fixed in space ) holds for _ any _ erosion profile @xmath57 . as a consequence , the evolution dynamics for @xmath57 does not necessarily need to fulfill this requirement .    using eq.([trafo2 ] ) and the facts that @xmath62 and that any terms consisting only of spatial derivatives of @xmath1 have the same functional form in the comoving system when @xmath1 is substituted by @xmath63 , the evolution equation for the erosion process in the comoving frame reads explicitly @xmath64 eq.([trafo4 ] ) still constitutes a stochastic integro - partial differential equation by virtue of the nonlocal term @xmath65 .",
    "only if @xmath66 or , equivalently , the mean erosion depth @xmath20 were moving with a _ constant _ speed for all times , eq.([trafo4 ] ) would reduce to the damped stochastic ks equation .",
    "in general , however , this can not be invoked , in particular because of the presence of the ks - type nonlinearity @xmath67 . by taking the spatial average of eq.([trafo4 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath68 , one can directly connect the mean erosion depth @xmath20 to the dynamics of the local erosion profile @xmath57 , @xmath69 \\label{trafo5}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 has been assumed .",
    "consider first the deterministic part of ( [ trafo5 ] ) , i.e. with @xmath71 .",
    "since the integrand of the second term on the right hand side of eq.([trafo5 ] ) is positive for all times , the mean erosion depth @xmath20 systematically deviates from a linear time evolution given by @xmath72 . for @xmath73 being negative ( positive )",
    "the mean erosion depth is therefore retarded ( advanced ) in comparison to @xmath72 .",
    "noteworthy , this fact is not a specific property triggered by the nonlocal term in eq.([trafo2 ] ) , it is already present in the standard ks equation and from related studies there@xcite , it is known that the second term of the right hand side of ( [ trafo5 ] ) significantly contributes to the time evolution of @xmath20 . the additional impact of the term @xmath74 is roughly that of a superposed wiener process since @xmath75 has been assumed to be a gaussian and white .",
    "as explained in the previous section , it is not obvious how the nonlocal equations ( [ trafo2 ] ) and ( [ trafo4 ] ) are related to the damped ks equation .",
    "here we show in a more general context how the nonlocal term can be elimated by an appropriate transformation .",
    "specifically our statement is as follows : there is a transformation @xmath76 that maps the general form of a _ nonlocal _ stochastic evolution equation given by @xmath77 + f_0- \\partial_t \\overline h + \\eta \\label{eqta}\\ ] ] to a _ local _ evolution equation in the transformed variables @xmath78 reading @xmath79+\\eta \\label{eqtb}\\ ] ] where , quite generally , the functional @xmath80 in the eqs.([eqta ] ) and ( [ eqtb ] ) can contain any combination of derivatives of @xmath81 or @xmath78 , respectively , but no explicit dependence on @xmath81 or @xmath78 .    as subsequently useful observation",
    ", we note that eq.([eqtb ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath82 with @xmath61 being an arbitrary constant .",
    "obviously , ( [ eqta ] ) contains the model equation ( [ trafo4 ] ) as special case if we set @xmath83=a_1 \\nabla^2 h+a_2\\nabla^4 h+a_3(\\nabla h)^2 $ ] .",
    "to the constructive derivation of the statement : in order to find the desired transformation we use the ansatz @xmath84 where the time - dependent function @xmath85 is so far arbitrary and will be subsequently determined .",
    "since @xmath86 and spatial derivatives of @xmath81 transform without any change to spatial derivatives in @xmath78 , insertion of ( [ eqtc ] ) into eq.([eqta ] ) yields @xmath79+\\eta + \\partial_t f - bf- \\partial_t \\overline h. \\label{eqtd}\\ ] ] in order to arrive from eq.([eqta ] ) at eq.([eqtb ] ) , one has to demand that the last three terms on the right hand side of eq.([eqtd ] ) vanish at any time , @xmath87 the linear nonautonomous ordinary differential equation ( [ eqte ] ) can be solved for @xmath85 by standard means , e.g. by the method of variation of constants . introducing @xmath88 and solving the resulting equation @xmath89 yields @xmath90 . \\label{eqtf}\\ ] ] in general , the integration constant @xmath91 in ( [ eqtf ] ) can be arbitrarily chosen .",
    "this is a consequence of the afore - mentioned invariance of eq.([eqtb ] ) with respect to @xmath92 ( @xmath61 arbitrary and constant ) which implies that there is actually a continuous number of transformations leading from eq.([eqta ] ) to eq.([eqtb ] ) .",
    "a convenient choice , however , is to select as initial condition for @xmath78 that @xmath57 and @xmath93 initially coincide , i.e. @xmath94 .",
    "consequently , @xmath95 holds and the transformation reads @xmath96 the transformation ( [ eqtg ] ) that reduces the nonlocal equation ( [ eqta ] ) in @xmath81-system to a local equation ( [ eqtb ] ) in @xmath78-system has several specific properties .",
    "( i ) it is a purely _ temporal _ ( integral ) transformation relating @xmath57 in the physically meaningful coordinate system comoving to the mean evolution of the erosion depth with the evolution of @xmath93 in a temporally shifted system with no obvious physical significance .",
    "this shift @xmath97 being represented by the last two terms in ( [ eqtg ] ) , takes over the nonlocal properties of eq.([eqta ] ) and is therefore nonlocal by virtue of the last term in ( [ eqtg ] ) .",
    "noteworthy , @xmath98 integrates over the temporal history of the mean velocity of the erosion front via @xmath99 .",
    "( ii ) the stochastic part in eq.([eqta ] ) remains unchanged by the transformation .",
    "( iii ) the transformation ( [ eqtg ] ) is highly useful because it allows for the direct applicability of theoretical and numerical results obtained from eq.([eqtb ] ) to eq.([eqta ] ) .",
    "note , however , that for a correct interpretation in the physical meaningful @xmath1- or @xmath81-system the full temporal information of the mean evolution of the erosion front @xmath20 needs to be separately determined .",
    "if the dynamics of @xmath93 is known , this can be achieved by using @xmath100 } + \\overline\\eta(t^\\prime)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{trafo11}\\ ] ] ( iv ) the basic prerequisite for the transformation ( [ eqtg ] ) is that eq.([eqta ] ) is linear in @xmath81 .",
    "extensions to nonlinear dependences on @xmath81 in eq.([eqta ] ) do not seem to be generally feasible .    for the specific case under consideration , @xmath83=a_1 \\nabla^2 h+a_2\\nabla^4 h+a_3(\\nabla h)^2 $ ] , the transformation ( [ eqtg ] ) can be further simplified . using ( [ trafo3 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath101 and , consequently , @xmath102 which constitutes the damped ks equation in the @xmath78-system and possesses the obvious invariance under the transformation @xmath103 .",
    "eq.([eqtk ] ) shows the importance and the genuine interrelation of the ks - type nonlinearity for the non - triviality of the transformation .",
    "if @xmath73 equals zero , then simply @xmath104 follows .",
    "this argument can be generalized : separating the functional @xmath83 $ ] in eq.([eqta ] ) in terms that can be rewritten as the divergence of a flux , @xmath105=\\nabla\\cdot{\\bf j}_{\\rm f}$ ] , and terms @xmath106 $ ] that can not , the corresponding transformation is determined by @xmath107}(t^\\prime)$ ] .",
    "consequently , any term being nonlinear and not originating from a flux leads to analogous complications as the term @xmath108 . only if @xmath106=0 $ ] , then again @xmath104 holds implying that @xmath109 .",
    "the general idea behind model equations such as eq.([trafo2 ] ) is that any individual term entering into the sum on the right hand side has its individual physical significance . as argued by facsko et al .",
    "@xcite , the nonlocal term in ( [ trafo2 ] ) might be interpreted as a redepostion effect of eroded particles . to clarify the role of the nonlocal term in eq.([trafo2 ] ) , @xmath110 , we disregard , for the moment , all terms in eq.([trafo2 ] ) that depend on derivatives of @xmath1 and the stochastic fluctuations @xmath75 .",
    "so , the equation @xmath111 remains to be solved .",
    "obviously @xmath66 holds and , consequently , ( i ) the mean depth evolution increases linearly with time for all times @xmath26 according to @xmath112 and ( ii ) @xmath29 can be rewritten as @xmath113 showing that this term , individually considered , acts locally in the frame moving with @xmath72 .",
    "the solution for the erosion profile @xmath1 is then simply given by @xmath114 .",
    "for negative @xmath115 , the impact of the term @xmath110 is just an exponential diminishment of the initial target profile @xmath24 in such a way that the overall shape and , in particular , the maxima , minima , and inclination points of @xmath116 remain at same spatial positions .",
    "only the amplitude of @xmath8 decays in time .",
    "consequently , it is not obvious whether the term @xmath110 can be interpreted as a redeposition effect that should also lead to a lateral variation of the erosion profile .      taking advantage of the afore - mentioned arguments on the role of the nonlinearity in ( [ trafo2 ] ) , ignoring the stochastic fluctuations for the moment and linearizing eq.([trafo2 ] ) , i.e. omitting the term @xmath7 , yields @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , a flat erosion front given by @xmath118 or , equivalently @xmath119 solves the deterministic limit of the linearized version of eq.([trafo2 ] ) and determines its basic solution . consequently , as far as the linear stability of the flat erosion front solution is concerned , the nonlocal term can be replaced by the local term @xmath72 in the linearized eq.([trafo2 ] ) . then , standard techniques can be invoked for the stability analysis of @xmath120 : using an ansatz for a perturbation of @xmath119 of the form @xmath121 $ ] , yields a dispersion relation @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) for the growth rate @xmath124 of perturbations with a wave vector @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , @xmath124 has its maximum at @xmath126 with @xmath127 and the flat erosion front @xmath120 is stable if @xmath128 .",
    "a crucial point of our discussion is the fact that variations of the mean erosion velocity about @xmath42 , @xmath130 , are generally non - zero and not even constant during the course of the erosion process . here",
    ", we substantiate this by numerical simulations of eq.([trafo2 ] ) for a representative set of parameter values that leads to hexagonal patterns and draw some further conclusions .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the evolution of the ensemble or stochastically averaged evolution of @xmath131 given by @xmath132 since @xmath133 . for this quantity , the stochasticity necessarily present in individual runs of the erosion process , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , is leveled out . in both cases ,",
    "the initial target profile has been kept fixed to a small gaussian distribution of the initial amplitudes with a maximum amplitude of @xmath134 about the perfectly flat state .",
    "the generic behavior as function of time consists of three parts : ( i ) for very small erosion times , @xmath135 is very close to zero since here the nonlinearity in the evolution equation can be neglected and , therefore mainly the linear evolution of @xmath1 contributes . since @xmath131 is proportional to @xmath136 this leads to a purely exponential increase for short times as depicted in the insets of fig . 1 .",
    "( ii ) with increasing erosion time , the amplitude @xmath1 eventually reaches values where the nonlinear term in eq.([trafo2 ] ) becomes comparable in size to linear terms . in this crossover time range , @xmath135 increases very rapidly up to a point where the subsequent increase drastically slows down .",
    "( iii ) for longer times , where the nonlinearity in eq.([trafo2 ] ) is fully developed , the ks - nonlinearity @xmath7 mainly reduces the further increase of @xmath135 almost to a constant .",
    "our numerical simulations that went very far into the full nonlinear regime , however , do not indicate a full saturation , but a slight systematic increase with time that depends almost linearly on @xmath26 in the simulated time range .",
    "similar behavior for individual erosion processes ( albeit slightly modified by its intrinsic stochasticity ) can also be read off from fig .",
    "2 . an important consequence of this dynamical behavior of eq.([trafo2 ] ) is the fact that the underlying surface morphology @xmath8 does not saturate in a steady state unless @xmath131 fully saturates into a constant value . to substantiate this statement",
    ", we show in the insets of fig . 2 for two representative erosion times the corresponding morphology behavior that clearly indicates a non - steady evolution .",
    "finally , we like to draw attention to a challenging point for further experiments . due to the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath135 as function of the erosion time that is triggered by the ks - nonlinearity",
    ", a specific experimental measurement of this quantity can lead to experimental evidence for the existence and dominance of no - flux terms as discussed in section iii .",
    "to conclude , we stress the most important points of our investigation : ( i ) the nonlocal , damped ks equation suggested by facsko et al .",
    "@xcite can be obtained as minimal model from balance equation considerations if nonlocal terms compatible with the underlying invariances are allowed .",
    "most importantly , such a nonlocal term being proportional to @xmath137 leads in combination with the ks nonlinearity to a non - monotonic time evolution of the spatially averaged erosion depth and , connected with that , to a surface morphology that does not generally seem to approach a steady state ( at least on the simulated time scales ) .",
    "( ii ) the necessity for a non - local dependence arises from the fact that the ks nonlinearity can not be rewritten in form of the divergence of a flux .",
    "if all terms entering into the evolution equation could be rewritten in form of such divergences , the non - local term could be replaced by a simple drift term @xmath138 .",
    "( iii ) by using a specific transformation presented in section iii , the nonlocal , damped ks equation can be exactly recast in form of a standard ( non - local ) damped ks equation .",
    "this property greatly simplifies the analysis of the evolution equations .",
    "finally , we have also briefly proposed a simple experimental measurement in order to substantiate the pronounced effect of the ks nonlinearity or at least related non - flux nonlinearities during the erosion process .",
    "building on the results presented here , we will discuss , in a subsequent publication , the rich pattern forming structure of an appropriately generalized non - local anisotropic damped ks equation for the case of oblique incidence .",
