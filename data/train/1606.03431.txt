    "however , in general @xmath0 is quite different from the polynomial ring : for example , if @xmath10 then @xmath0 is not even noetherian .",
    "this paper is an investigation of the theory of @xmath0-modules . even though @xmath0 is typically non - noetherian",
    ", we show that finitely presented @xmath0-modules are well - behaved , and prove a variety of results concerning them . in the remainder of the introduction , we summarize our results and explain our motivation for studying @xmath0-modules .",
    "recall that a ring @xmath11 is * coherent * if every finitely generated ideal is finitely presented .",
    "equivalently , @xmath11 is coherent if the kernel of any map of finitely presented modules is again finitely presented ; this ensures that the category of finitely presented modules is abelian .",
    "our first result about @xmath0 is :    [ mainthm : coh ] if @xmath1 is noetherian then @xmath0 is coherent",
    ".    in fact , our results are more precise , in two ways .",
    "first , we give a complete characterization of the rings @xmath1 for which @xmath0 is graded - coherent ( meaning any finitely generated homogeneous ideal is finitely presented ) : namely , @xmath0 is graded - coherent if and only if @xmath1 is coherent and for any finitely generated ideal @xmath12 of @xmath1 , the torsion submodule of @xmath13 has finite exponent .",
    "and second , when @xmath1 is noetherian , we actually prove that @xmath0 is * grbner - coherent*. this is a notion we introduce in @xcite , which basically means that there is a good theory of grbner bases for finitely generated ideals in @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , this means that calculations with finitely presented @xmath0-modules are algorithmic , at least in principle .",
    "we next investigate the structure of finitely presented @xmath0-modules , working under the assumption that @xmath1 is noetherian .",
    "we first construct certain nice resolutions . in general , finitely presented @xmath0-modules do not have finite projective dimension .",
    "there are two obsturctions .",
    "first , if @xmath14 is a @xmath1-module with infinite projective dimension then @xmath15 has infinite projective dimension as a @xmath0-module . and second , if @xmath16 is",
    "non - zero and @xmath17 is a power of @xmath18 then @xmath19}\\ ] ] is naturally a @xmath0-module , and does not have finite projective dimension .",
    "we therefore introduce a class of modules that includes the above two counterexamples : we say that a @xmath0-module @xmath14 is * special * if it has a finite length filtration such that the graded pieces have the form @xmath20 , where @xmath14 is a finitely generated @xmath1-module , @xmath2 is a power of a prime @xmath18 , and @xmath21 if @xmath22 .",
    "we then prove :    [ intro : sr ] every finitely presented @xmath0-module @xmath14 admits a finite resolution @xmath23 by special modules .",
    "in fact , one can take @xmath24 to be free and @xmath25 to be special , and one can bound @xmath26 in terms of the krull dimension of @xmath1 ( if it is finite ) .    as consequence of this theorem , we obtain a useful spanning set for the grothendieck group @xmath27 of finitely presented @xmath0-modules . with more work ,",
    "we prove :    [ intro : intk ] there is a canonical short exact sequence @xmath28 where the direct sum is taken over all prime numbers .",
    "this sequence splits if and only if for every prime @xmath18 the natural map @xmath29 is zero .",
    "we next investigate the injective dimension of @xmath0-modules .",
    "we begin by completely characterizing the injective dimension of @xmath0 over itself when @xmath1 is a field .",
    "we next show that if @xmath30 is a bounded complex of @xmath1-modules with finitely generated homology and injective amplitude @xmath31 $ ] then @xmath32 has injective amplitude @xmath33 $ ] , and show that @xmath34 can be lowered to @xmath35 or even @xmath36 in certain cases .",
    "using this , we show that if @xmath37 is a dualizing complex for @xmath1 then @xmath38 is one for @xmath0 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath1 admits a dualizing complex then the bounded derived category of finitely presented @xmath0-modules is self - dual .",
    "next we study the relationship between torsion modules and finitely presented modules . here , an element @xmath39 of a @xmath0-module @xmath14 is said to be * torsion * if @xmath9 } m=0 $ ] for all @xmath40 , and @xmath14 is said to be * torsion * if all of its elements are . if @xmath1 contains a field of characteristic  0",

    "however , this is essentially the only example :    the following conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "every finitely presented @xmath0-module is torsion - free . 2 .",
    "every maximal ideal of @xmath1 has positive residue characteristic .",
    "when @xmath1 is @xmath18-adically complete , we can say much more , at least for graded modules :    [ intro : torext ] suppose @xmath1 is @xmath18-adically complete .",

    ". then @xmath43 for all @xmath44 .",
    "here @xmath45 denotes a graded version of @xmath46 , see  [ ss : notation ] .",
    "the above theorem is false without the completeness hypothesis , see remark  [ rmk : ext - torsion ] .",
    "it is also false in the non - graded case , as example   [ ex : ext ] ( with @xmath10 ) shows .",
    "finally , motivated by certain applications ( see  [ ss : motivation ] ) , we study `` nearly finitely presented '' ( nfp ) @xmath0-modules .",
    "a graded @xmath0-module @xmath14 is nfp if there exists a finitely presented @xmath0-module @xmath47 ( called a * weak fp - envelope * of @xmath14 ) such that @xmath48 as @xmath0-modules , where @xmath49 denotes truncation to degrees @xmath50 ( see  [ s : nfp ] ) .",
    "when @xmath1 is complete , nfp modules are very well behaved :    suppose @xmath1 is @xmath18-adically complete .",
    "then the kernel , cokernel , and image of a map of nfp modules is again nfp , and so the category of nfp modules is abelian .",
    "furthermore , the weak fp - envelope @xmath47 of an nfp module @xmath14 is unique up to canonical isomorphism , and there exists a canonical map @xmath51 that is universal among maps from @xmath14 to finitely presented modules .    as with the previous theorem ,",
    "this one is false without the completeness assumption , see proposition  [ prop : counter - example ] .",
    "when @xmath1 is not complete , we can at least prove uniqueness of the weak fp - envelope in some cases :    suppose that every maximal ideal of @xmath1 has residue characteristic @xmath18 , for some fixed prime number @xmath18 .",
    "then the weak fp - envelope of an nfp module is unique up to isomorphism .",
    "the isomorphism in the above theorem is not canonical , and the weak fp - envelope of @xmath14 is not functorial in @xmath14 .",
