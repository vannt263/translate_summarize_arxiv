    "every satellite orbiting a host galaxy produces tidal debris . yet",
    ", we find debris only around very few globular clusters or dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is because the amount and shape of tidal debris differs substantially from satellite to satellite . that is",
    ", every satellite leaves its own unique trace in the gravitational potential of its host .",
    "this being said , we can expect tidal debris to contain substantial information about the satellite , its orbit , and its host .",
    "using the example of the most prominent globular cluster stream discovered so far , palomar5 , we are going to demonstrate in the following how this information can be extracted through sophisticated stream detection , numerical modeling and bayesian inference .",
    "+   + with the onset of the era of survey science , detections of tidal debris have become numerous  as extended overdensities in surface density ; first from photographic plates @xcite , and more recently in the data from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "this number grew as the homogeneity and coverage increased with subsequent data releases @xcite .",
    "newly available imaging surveys like atlas @xcite or pandas @xcite add to this growing list of tidal features .",
    "some tidal streams were also , or solely , found as coherent structures in velocity space @xcite . with the richness of ongoing and future surveys like apogee , des , lamost , panstarrs , rave , skymapper , gaia , and lsst @xcite , we will be supplied with ever growing amounts of observational data on tidal debris of known and unknown satellites within the milky way disk and in the halo .",
    "+   + despite this amount of data  available or yet to come ",
    "few attempts have been made to exploit the wealth of information encoded in these coherent structures .",
    "most investigations studied theoretical cases ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and only a few have actually tried to model the observations directly ( e.g.  @xcite ) , as appropriate modeling techniques are only becoming available now .",
    "the two most noteworthy examples for streams that have been modeled by utilizing the observational data self - consistently are the sagittarius stream and the gd-1 stream , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssec : discussion ] in detail .",
    "the modeling of these two tidal streams have demonstrated the power ( but also the caveats ) of using tidal streams to infer the mass and shape of the milky way s gravitational potential .",
    "+   + the reason for the relatively low number of fully modeled tidal streams is twofold : first of all , generating a realistic model of a satellite s debris usually requires @xmath7-body simulations of some sort , which are computationally expensive and therefore do not allow for large model - parameter scans .",
    "however , a realistic stream model is necessary , since it has been shown that streams do not strictly follow progenitor orbits @xcite , and that fitting a stream with a single orbit can lead to significant biases in potential estimates @xcite .",
    "angle - action approaches for generating stream realizations are a promising way of reducing the computational needs @xcite . here",
    "we will make use of restricted three - body models , so - called _ streaklines _ , that allow us to generate a realistic stream model at small computational cost @xcite .",
    "the second reason is that comparisons of observational data to theoretical models are not straightforward .",
    "this is in most cases due to the faintness of the structures , that is , due to the heavy foreground and background contaminations from the galaxy itself .",
    "probabilistic approaches to such a problem , however , require a manifold of stream models , which is why most stream modeling approaches so far are only applied to ( uncontaminated and error - free ) simulations of satellite streams @xcite or remain qualitative @xcite .",
    "newly available and computationally inexpensive generative models finally allow us to make such probabilistic statements on the model parameters describing observed tidal streams .",
    "+   + the problems mentioned above can be alleviated , if both observational data and stream models are simplified in a sensible way , for example , when individual , definite members of a satellite s debris can be identified and when their phase - space coordinates can be measured with high precision ( e.g. , rr lyraes or blue horizontal branch stars ; @xcite ) . with the ` rewinder ` method , @xcite demonstrated that , in this case , orbits of stream stars can be traced back in time to the point where they escaped from the progenitor . with only a few stream stars the authors demonstrated that they are able to tightly constrain their model parameters @xcite .",
    "however , such an identification of stream members may often not be possible due to the sparsity of tracers or due to the unavailability of accurate phase - space information .",
    "+   + in this work , we present an alternative way to address both of these problems , i.e.  that allows us to quickly generate thousands of stream models , and to compare them to well - established parts of an otherwise heavily contaminated stream in the halo of the milky way even if large parts of the phase - space information is missing .",
    "we will make use of a new method for detecting stream overdensities , computationally efficient _ streakline _ models @xcite , and the ` fast - forward ` method , a bayesian framework developed in @xcite for constraining galactic potentials by forward modeling of tidal streams ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : streaklines ] ) .",
    "+   + here we are going to apply a variant of the ` fast - forward ` method to the tidal debris of the low - mass globular cluster palomar5 ( pal5 ; see sec .",
    "[ ssec : observations ] for a detailed description ) . due to its unique position high above the galactic bulge and due to its current orbital phase of being very close to its apogalacticon ,",
    "the tidal tails of this cluster are so prominent in sdss that pal5 can be considered to be the poster child of all globular cluster streams .",
    "its tails stand out so prominently from the foreground / background that substructure can be seen within the stream with high significance ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : overdensities ] , and @xcite ) .",
    "using a _ difference - of - gaussians _ process , we will detect overdensities , measure their positions and extents , and then use them in our modeling to compare our models to these firmly established parts of the pal5 stream ( sec .",
    "[ ssec : comparison ] ) .",
    "+   + understanding the origin of such stream overdensities may give us detailed insight to a satellite s past dynamical evolution .",
    "@xcite found that tidal shocks from the galactic disk or bulge shocks could introduce substructure in dynamically cold tidal tails .",
    "however , @xcite used @xmath7-body simulations of pal5 to show that disk or bulge shocks are not the origin of the observed overdensities .",
    "instead , the authors suggested that larger perturbations such as giant molecular clouds or spiral arms may have caused this substructure . in subsequent publications , several other scenarios for substructure formation within tidal streams",
    "have been discussed . a promising source of frequent and strong tidal shocks",
    "should be given through dark matter subhalos orbiting in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "encounters with these subhalos should be the more frequent the lower the subhalo mass  and the hope is that , with better observational data , tidal streams may be used as detectors for these dark structures @xcite . in a promising first attempt ,",
    "@xcite quantified substructures in pal5 s tidal tails and compared the number of detected gaps in the stream with expectation of @xmath7-body simulations .",
    "the authors concluded that some structures in the pal5 stream are likely to be of such an origin .",
    "a different approach was taken by @xcite , who suggested that jeans instabilities could form periodic patterns in cold tidal streams .",
    "however , @xcite showed that tidal streams are gravitationally stable , and hence that pal5 s overdensities can not be of this origin .",
    "as an alternative to tidal shocks or gravitational instabilities , @xcite and @xcite found that epicyclic motion of stars along tidal tails can create periodic density variations in the tails when they are generated assuming a continuos flow of stars through the lagrange points ( see also sec .",
    "[ sssec : escape ] ) . @xcite and @xcite showed that these regular patterns of overdensities and underdensities are also present in tidal tails of clusters on eccentric orbits about their host galaxy , and that they are most pronounced when the cluster is in the apocenter of its orbit .",
    "moreover , @xcite demonstrated with @xmath7-body simulations that clusters on pal5-like orbits can produce regularly spaced overdensities in their tails . in the following , we are going to show with our modeling of the pal5 stream that several of the observed overdensities closer to the cluster are very likely to be due to such epicyclic motion .",
    "these overdensities help us to find the correct model of pal5 as they stick out more significantly from the foreground / background than the rest of the stream .",

    "this marked the discovery of the first coherently mapped tidal stream . with subsequent data releases ,",
    "the tails were found to span 22 deg within the sdss footprint @xcite , where the trailing tail can be traced for about 18.5 deg , while the leading tail is cut off by the edge of the survey at a length of only 3.5 deg .",
    "successive attempts to detect the trailing tail beyond this extent , e.g. , by using neural networks @xcite , had not been successful . however , with sdss data release 8 the photometric uniformity and coverage of the pal5 stream increased @xcite . in this data , @xcite found the trailing stream to extend out to 23.2 deg from the cluster center , where the stream runs off the footprint .",

    "various attempts have been made at constraining its virial mass , or the halo mass enclosed within a certain limiting radius , using all kinds of available tracers of the galactic matter distribution .",
    "some approaches also attempted to constrain the shape of the dark matter distribution , i.e.  its flattening or triaxiality . here",
    "we list a few of the more recent measurements , first for the enclosed mass and then for the shape of the dark halo .",
    "most of the estimates listed in the following are summarized as a rotation curve in fig .",
    "[ rotationcurve ] , in which we collected enclosed mass estimates and circular velocity estimates from these references .",
    "however , we note that a comparison between the various studies is difficult due to the different measures quoted by the authors",
    ". moreover , different tracers probe different radii , and some probe the galactic potential in the mw disk , whereas others probe it at different points within the ( not necessarily symmetric ) halo . in an attempt to facilitate comparison , we compiled a list of `` classical '' measures from our own modeling of pal5 ( tab .  [",
    "tab : halomass ] ) , but would like to point out that pal5 essentially probes the galactic mass within its apogalactic radius of @xmath12kpc .",
    "our estimate for the mw s mass beyond that radius or its virial mass solely relies on the assumption that the dark halo potential is of nfw form . from our modeling",
    "there is no indication that this is the correct parametrization for the dark halo potential .",
    "in fact , most of the most recent studies indicate that the virial mass of the milky way halo is lower than our best - fit value .",
    "this may indicate that the nfw potential parametrization is a poor choice in the case of the milky way .",
    "+   + @xcite fit three different , simple analytic galaxy models , each consisting of a disk , a bulge and a ( spherical ) halo , to a range of dynamical constraints .",
    "they compute various quantities for their models , of which we mention here only the mass enclosed inside a radius of 50 kpc , as it involves the least extrapolation .",
    "depending on the parametrization they choose , they get values for @xmath13 between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is noteworthy that these estimates exclude each other , and solely differ in the choice of parametrization .",
    "we therefore focus on our mass estimate for pal5 s apogalactic radius of about 19kpc , and only give the other mass estimates for completeness .",
    "+   + however , since pal5 is located well above the disk , it is outside any symmetry plane , which makes a definition of an enclosed mass difficult .",
    "a better estimate can be made , if we instead calculate the acceleration vector on pal5 at its current position from the analytic potential . for its absolute value ,",
    "we get @xmath16pcmyr@xmath17 ( @xmath18ms@xmath17 ) , which we can convert into a `` circular velocity '' ( using eq .  [ eq : vcpal5 ] ) of @xmath19kms@xmath3 , or an equivalent spherically distributed mass yielding @xmath20 .",
    "if we assume that pal5 lies in the plane of the galactic disk at this radius , we arrive at @xmath21 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ rotationcurve ] , our circular velocity estimate bridges a gap between estimates from halo tracers and estimates from disk tracers ( fig .  [ rotationcurve ] ) .",

    "+   + the brightest tracers in the milky way halo , and hence the most obvious targets for milky - way - mass studies , are the galactic satellites , i.e.  globular clusters and dwarf galaxies , but also bright stellar tracers for which reasonable distances can be estimated , e.g.  blue horizontal branch stars ( bhb ) . results from such studies differ widely due to ambiguities in the assumed anisotropy of the tracers .",
    "@xcite used positions , distances , radial velocities and a few existing proper motions of 27 satellites beyond 20kpc to estimate a milky way mass of @xmath22 within a radius of 50kpc .",
    "similarly , @xcite get masses for the milky way inside a radius of 100kpc of @xmath23 , depending on the assumed orbital anisotropy of the satellites .",

    "@xcite apply spherical jeans models to a sample of several hundred bhb and rr lyrae stars with distances between 25 and 80kpc .",
    "they determine an enclosed mass of @xmath29 .",

    "most recently , @xcite modeled the sagittarius stream and arrive at @xmath32 , which is at the lower end of the spectrum of mass estimates . +   + in fig .",
    "[ rotationcurve ] , we also include some mass estimates , or circular velocity estimates , for the solar environment to get a more complete picture of the galactic rotation curve .",

    "@xcite uses a range of tracers and constraints to arrive at @xmath36kms@xmath3 .",
    "our estimate for the circular velocity at the solar radius is @xmath37kms@xmath3 , and for the solar radius we get @xmath38kpc ( see sec .",
    "[ ssec : discussionsolarparameters ] ) .",
    "+   + ultimately , tracers in the disk and in the halo have to be combined and modeled altogether .",
    "following such an approach , @xcite infer a mass within 200kpc of @xmath39 .",
    "they argue that the uncertainties for the solar galactocentric distance and the circular velocity at the location of the sun are the two main causes of uncertainties for mass estimates in the inner mw , whereas the missing constraints on the radial anisotropy of the tracers phase - space distribution in the halo is responsible for the uncertainties at large radii .",
    "+   + in fact , the mass estimates from the halo tracer studies differ widely , and it has to be assumed that they suffer from the complexity , i.e.  non - sphericity , of the galactic mass distribution , and of streaming motions among halo stars . from sdss data , @xcite find the stellar halo to be significantly oblate , but furthermore show that a significant fraction of the halo stars ( > 40% ) are in spatial substructures .",
    "this observation is evidence that large part of the stellar halo is formed from infalling satellites ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is unclear what kind of biases such coherent structures could cause in the modeling of the stellar halo .",
    "while the coherent debris of galactic satellites is unpleasant noise for the modeling of the stellar halo , it may offer the most powerful way of measuring the mass distribution of the milky way . from our point of view from within the galaxy , tidal streams like the sagittarius stream @xcite or the gd-1 stream @xcite span huge arcs on the sky , and as coherent phase - space structures simultaneously probe large parts of the milky way potential without the need for a tracer density profile or assumptions on orbital anisotropy .",
    "moreover , the hope is that debris streams are also sensitive to the shape of the mass distribution and therefore can give us insights to the 3d mass profile of the milky way s dark halo .",
    "however , the many studies on the sagittarius ( sgr ) stream have shown that inferring the shape of the dark matter halo from a stream as complex as sgr is non - trivial .",
    "+   + since the first models of the disrupting sgr satellite by @xcite and @xcite , the interpretation of its debris has led to many different conclusions .",
    "early numerical models of the sgr stream were made in spherical halo potentials , and the quantity and quality of data on the discovered debris was not conclusive enough to pinpoint a specific shape of the halo .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a large flattening of the halo potential would lead to a significant orbital precession between the leading and the trailing tail , and hence they argued against potential flattenings with @xmath40 .",
    "when sgr was traced along a nearly perfect great circle on the sky in 2mass data @xcite this hypothesis seemed to be further confirmed .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the sgr stream was in fact too young to be sensitive the halo shape , and that the halo potential could therefore be either oblate , spherical or prolate . with more kinematic data at hand , @xcite finally argued for a prolate halo shape , while @xcite and @xcite argued for an oblate halo to explain the small degree of orbital precession observed in the sgr debris . with successive detections of new parts of sgr s tidal debris , this discussion has yet become more complicated .",
    "moreover , @xcite and @xcite have found bifurcations in sgr s leading and trailing stream , which are still not understood . @xcite and @xcite tried to explain these new features with multiple wraps of the stream around the milky way , or with rotation in the sgr progenitor , respectively . yet , to the present day there has been no conclusive model that can explain all observed sgr features . +   + using a large set of collisionless @xmath7-body simulations , @xcite reproduced many parts of the observed debris .",
    "however , they found the necessary shape of the dark matter halo to be rather peculiar : the observed positions , distances and radial velocities of sgr debris stars can be explained by a satellite orbiting within a triaxial halo potential that has its minor axis pointing towards the sun within the disk .",
    "that is , the dark matter distribution resembles an oblate halo perpendicular to the galactic disk , which we see face on when we look towards the galactic center .",
    "@xcite confirmed these findings using also other observational constraints and a different form of parametrization for the galactic potential .",
    "+   + however , several problems have been pointed out with such a configuration .",
    "@xcite tried to produce a stable galaxy configuration resembling the proposed scenario of @xcite using a live dark matter halo , and found it to be highly unstable .",
    "moreover , @xcite demonstrated that the thin morphology of the pal5 stream can not be reproduced in such a triaxial configuration .",
    "such cross checks of stream modeling results are obviously vital ; a certain galactic potential that can produce one specific stream also has to be able to yield models for all other streams .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found that it is easily possible to find a stream model that has the long , thin and curved morphology of the observed pal5 stream in a spherical halo potential .",
    "moreover , the authors point out that a model , which fits the morphology within a spherical halo potential , also naturally reproduces pal5 s radial velocity gradient , making a strong case for a nearly spherical dark halo potential . @xcite",
    "have in fact shown that it is possible to reproduce the @xcite observational constraints in a galaxy potential that is spherical .",
    "however , they found the necessary potential to be peculiar as well , in that it has to have a rising rotation curve at large radii .",
    "+   + from cosmological ( dark - matter - only ) simulations we expect dark matter _ density _",
    "profiles to be triaxial , where the expected axis ratios lie between 0.4 and 0.6 for the short , intermediate , and long axes @xcite .",
    "while these axis ratios should be prevalent at large galactocentric radii , @xcite and @xcite showed that condensations of baryons leads to rounder halos in centers of galaxies .",
    "@xcite therefore suggested a potential form that is triaxial in the outer parts and more spherical in the inner parts .",
    "they showed that with such a configuration and an inner potential flattening of about 0.9 it is possible to reproduce a sgr configuration like the @xcite model .",
    "a flattening / triaxiality that varies with galactocentric radius may in fact be a way to resolve many conflicts between existing milky way mass estimates .",
    "+   + yet , sgr s story is not over : new observational data from @xcite show that sgr",
    "s tidal debris goes in fact out to 100kpc .",
    "this debris structure can not be reproduced by the @xcite model .",
    "while the halo configuration of @xcite ( milky way halo with a spherical but sharply cut - off density profile ) can reproduce the apocentric distances of observed sgr debris , and also the precession of sgr s orbital plane , it has not been shown to reproduce all available observational features .",
    "thus , there is still no model of the sgr satellite that can reproduce all observational constraints simultaneously .",
    "+   + the only other stream that has been modeled to infer the shape of the milky way s dark halo has used the 63deg long gd-1 stream @xcite .",
    "the gd-1 stream is very thin but lacks any obvious progenitor satellite , hence it is most probably the stream of a dissolved globular cluster .",
    "in contrast to the sgr satellite it orbits in the inner halo .",
    "@xcite estimate the pericenter and apocenter of its orbit to be 14kpc and 26kpc , respectively . by fitting orbits to sky positions of the debris , distances along the stream , radial velocities , and proper motions , the authors conclude that the best - fitting orbits constrain the dark halo to be nearly spherical .",
    "they place a lower limit on the flattening of the dark halo potential , saying that with 90% confidence the halo flattening is @xmath41 .",
    "recently , @xcite confirmed these results with more sophisticated streakline modeling of the stream .",
    "+   + our results for the flattening also suggest that the inner 19kpc of the milky way s dark halo are rather spherical ( assuming that our choices for the disk and bulge potentials were reasonable ) . the results from the different fitting approaches all agree within their uncertainties with each other , and they are actually all compatible with a spherical halo .",
    "our best estimate is @xmath5 , which supports the notion of @xcite of having a slightly oblate inner halo , and a possibly less relaxed and probably triaxial halo at larger radii . on the other hand ,",
    "our result is also compatible with the nearly spherical `` phantom '' halos predicted by alternative gravity theories @xcite .",
    "+   + yet , the existence of the sgr dwarf galaxy and the two magellanic clouds should remind us that the halo is not necessarily a relaxed structure , but a constantly growing and probably highly substructured potential well .",
    "this is also suggested by @xcite based on observations of asymmetries in the galactic hi disk .",
    "in fact , the assumptions of steadiness and symmetry may be the main reasons for some of the discrepancies pointed out above and may pose the philosophical question of what we actually measure when we model tracers in the galactic halo . by applying the ` fast - forward ` method to 256 globular cluster streams , which formed in a cosmologically motivated , and time - evolving dark - matter halo of a milky - way sized galaxy , @xcite demonstrated that we can recover the _ present - day _ mass and shape of the dark matter halo to an accuracy of 5 - 20% .",
    "this , however , only holds for an ensemble of streams ; single streams can show mass biases of up to 50% . in order to avoid reporting such biased results , detailed comparison to simulated streams on similar orbits in similar potentials , and comparison to results on the same object from other ,",
    "independent methods should be taken into consideration .",
    "our positive result from the pal5-analog simulation ( sec .",
    "[ ssec : resultsanalog ] ) , and the agreement of our fitting results for all other model parameters with estimates from completely independent methods ( as shown in the following sections ) give us this necessary confidence in our results out to pal5 s apogalactic radius of 19kpc .",
    "we use five parameters to model pal5 and its orbit .",
    "the parameters are its distance to the sun , its proper motion ( 2 components ) , its mass , and its mass loss rate .      of all the cluster parameters in our modeling , the distance from the sun to pal5 is the observationally best determined parameter .",

    "the most pronounced overdensities we currently find lie in the trailing tail at a distance of about 3deg from the cluster , and have a significance of @xmath96 ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : overdensities ] ) , but many of the farther detections are only slightly above the detection limit .",
    "deeper imaging may also help to better characterize the nature of these overdensities , and conclusively differentiate between epicyclic overdensities and , e.g. , overdensities produced by past encounters of the pal5 stream with dark matter subhalos @xcite .",
