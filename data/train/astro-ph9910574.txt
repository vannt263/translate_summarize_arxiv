    "a precise ( and accurate ! ) value of the distance modulus to the lmc , @xmath1 , is a crucial component of the current cepheid - based extragalactic distance scale ; @xmath1 provides the anchor against which _ all hst - based cepheid distance determinations are measured . to date , both the _ hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale ( gibson  2000 ; mould  2000 ) and the _ sandage / saha type ia supernovae calibration team ( saha  1999 ) have adopted the `` canonical '' zero point of @xmath1=18.50 - the uncertainty in @xmath1 adopted by the _ key project was @xmath5mag ( , @xmath66.5% ) , representing the largest component of their global systematic error budget .",
    "while @xmath5mag may be the formal uncertainty associated with the ensemble distribution of published @xmath7 values ( in agreement with a similar analysis done by jha  1999 ) , i hesitate to attach a high level of confidence to such statistical analyses since the individual @xmath1 `` components '' in the ensemble distribution are as different as apples and oranges , with an uncomfortable lack of internal consistency between the apples and apples ( and oranges and oranges ) ! _ _ _ _    in what follows , i present a cursory overview of current ( mid - oct 1999 ) thinking regarding the distance to the lmc , contrasting the techniques employed in determining @xmath1 , and commenting upon their respective strengths and weaknesses .",
    "the implications for the extragalactic distance scale are inexorably linked and noted in section  3 .",
    "complementary recent reviews include popowski & gould ( 1999 ) , layden ( 1999 ) , and feast ( 1999 ) .",
    "figure  1 summarizes the state of the field at the time of writing ( mid - oct 1999 ) , and should be considered an updated , and somewhat more comprehensive , companion to cole s ( 1998 ) figure  1 .",
    "thirty - eight entries have been included here , and are displayed in descending order of @xmath1 .",
    "the technique employed is listed to the right of each entry , along with a reference number matching those in the caption .",
    "taking the extrema at face value ( @xmath1=18.07 and 18.74 ) demonstrates the gravity of the situation for the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath1=18.50 , gibson  ( 2000 ) derived h@xmath8=68kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 ; for @xmath1=18.07 , though , h@xmath8=83kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 , and for @xmath1=18.74 , h@xmath8=61kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 - , h@xmath8 could change by up to @xmath420% , simply by revising the choice of @xmath1 !",
    "a few general trends can be gleaned from a cursory inspection of figure  1 .",
    "first , methods based upon cepheids and fitting to local subdwarf sequences _ generally tend to favor the `` long '' distance scale ( , @xmath1@xmath218.5 ) .",
    "second , those based upon rr  lyrae statistical parallax and luminosity of the lmc red clump stars _ generally tend to favor the `` short '' scale ( , @xmath0@xmath1018.4 ) .",
    "third , those based upon the exact same data ( , sn  1987a circumstellar ring geometry and the lmc eclipsing binary hv  2274 ) are disturbingly author - dependent . _",
    "_      the most extreme proponents of the long distance scale are feast  ( 1998 ) and feast & catchpole ( 1997 ) , with @xmath1@xmath218.7",
    ". their earlier value of @xmath1=@xmath11 , based upon hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes of galactic cepheids , coupled with the @xmath12-band photometry of caldwell & laney ( 1991 ) , has been re - examined by three different groups and suggested to be too large by @xmath13mag .",
    "madore & freedman ( 1998 ) show that full multi - color photometry ( adopting permutations of two to six photometric bands for various cepheid subsets ) leads to a downward revision of @xmath14mag .",
    "oudmaijer  ( 1998 ) retain the single @xmath12-band photometry that feast & catchpole adopted , but apply a lutz - kelker bias correction to the parallaxes resulting in a 0.14mag downward revision .",
    "luri  ( 1998 ) employed their `` lm '' maximum - likelihood model ( which incorporates proper motions @xmath15 , radial velocities @xmath16 , and trigonometric parallaxes @xmath17 , into the mix , although @xmath17 enters in with apparently minimal weight - feast 1999 ) to revise feast & catchpole downward by 0.38mag ; this represents the lowest cepheid - based determination of @xmath1 , @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast with luri , feast  ( 1998 ) , also using a sample culled by @xmath16 and @xmath15 , find @xmath0=18.74@xmath60.13 ; the source of the discrepancy between the two studies is not readily apparent .",
    "subdwarf fitting techniques give the distance to a globular cluster by matching the cluster sequence to a corresponding one derived from calibrating stars in the solar neighborhood ; local subdwarfs with hipparcos parallaxes provide the calibrating sample .",
    "knowledge of the cluster s distance then yields an absolute luminosity for the resident rr  lyrae ( popowski & gould 1999 , equation  18 ) . assuming a range of cluster metallicities spanning that of the lmc rr  lyrae can be sampled , one can derive @xmath1 . as figure  1 shows ,",
    "subdwarf fitting techniques generally lead to a @xmath1 consistent with the long distance scale .",
    "reid ( 1997 ) and caretta  ( 1999 ) claim @xmath1@xmath19 , a consequence of which is that cluster horizontal branch stars are predicted to be @xmath40.2mag more luminous than their field counterparts .",
    "catelan ( 1998 ) has questioned the reality of this supposed cluster / field horizontal branch luminosity difference .",
    "reid s analysis leads to an extremely steep slope for the rr  lyrae m@xmath20-[fe / h ] relationship ; his figure  10 suggests a slope of @xmath21 , which seems difficult to reconcile with that observed in galactic and m31 globular cluster systems ( , @xmath22 ; fusi - pecci  1996 ) .",
    "gould & popowski ( 1998a , b ) and popowski & gould ( 1999 ) have stressed the influence of differing metallicity scales in the analyses as the primary source of the discrepancy between their `` short '' ( faint horizontal branch ( m@xmath23 at [ fe / h]=@xmath241.6 ) and older ( @xmath25gyrs ) globulars ) rr  lyrae scale and the reid / caretta et  al .",
    "`` long '' ( bright horizontal branch ( m@xmath26 at [ fe / h]=@xmath241.6 ) and younger ( @xmath27gyrs ) globulars ) scale .",
    "pinsonneault  ( 1998 ) suggest that residual spatially - dependent systematic hipparcos parallax errors should also be considered as a potential source of bias .",
    "statistical parallax works on the principle that one can balance the stellar radial velocity distribution of a sample of galactic rr  lyrae ( distance independent ) against that of its stellar proper motion distribution ( distance dependent ) .",
    "the balanced velocity ellipsoids provide the necessary distance scale parameter , which in turns provides the necessary rr  lyrae absolute luminosity calibration .",
    "statistical parallax , both prior to and subsequent to hipparcos , has consistently supported the `` short '' distance scale ( , layden  1996 ; gould & popowski 1998a , b ; layden 1999 ) .",
    "distances based upon linking miras in the lmc with those in the galaxy with accurate hipparcos parallaxes , because they are based on such a small sample ( 11 overtone pulsators , culled from an initial total sample of 15 candidates - van leeuwen  1997 ) , still have a large intrinsic scatter ( @xmath60.18mag ) and suffer from a 0.13mag systematic uncertainty depending upon the bandpass adopted .",
    "the ability to separate fundamental mode pulsators from overtone pulsators is also crucial , as any contamination by the former will systematically decrease the predicted @xmath1 .",
    "an appealing one - step technique which bypasses the intermediate assumption that various galactic stellar constituents ( , rr  lyrae , cepheids , miras ) are direct analogs to those in the lmc , is that based upon the geometry of the fluorescent light echo from the sn  1987a circumstellar ring .",
    "the technique consists of measuring the angular size of the ring with hst and comparing it to the absolute size , as estimated from the iue emission line light curves . in terms of observables ,",
    "the distance @xmath28 can be written ( after panagia 1998 ) : @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30d is the onset of uv emission , @xmath31 is the time of maximum uv line emission , and @xmath32 is the apparent angular ring size at @xmath31 .",
    "it is in the assignment of values to @xmath31 and @xmath32 where things start to get controversial .",
    "gould & uza ( 1998 ) adopt the weighted mean of the plait  ( 1995 ) hst [ oiii ] ring angular size determinations ( , @xmath33arcsec ) and the iue niii ] and niv ] light curves to derive @xmath34d .",
    "panagia ( 1998 ) though attaches weight to the jakobsen  ( 1991 ) 1988 pre - costar [ oiii ] observation of 0.830@xmath60.015 , and uses this in combination with the plait  data to extrapolate back to @xmath31 , yielding @xmath35 .",
    "panagia claims the ring radius grew in extent by 6% between 1988 and 1993 , while gould & uza assume a static ring .",
    "panagia uses the ciii ] , oiii ] , and niii ] iue light curves and favors @xmath36d . both @xmath31 solutions , despite being formally inconsistent at the 2@xmath3 level , look equally good to the eye . adopting their respective values",
    ", we can use equation  1 to derive @xmath1=18.37@xmath60.05 ( gould & uza 1998 ) and @xmath1=18.55@xmath60.05 ( panagia 1998 - aside : panagia applies a @xmath370.03shift to this value , under the assumption that sn  1987a lies 700pc in front of the lmc s center of mass ) .",
    "one - third of the resulting 0.18mag discrepancy is due to the different @xmath31 adopted , with the remaining two - thirds due to @xmath32 .",
    "if the ring is intrinsically elliptical , as suggested by crotts ( as cited by gould & uza ) , both teams @xmath1 may be underestimated by up to 0.07mag .",
    "the recent h@xmath38+nii observation of the reverse shock by garnavich  ( 1999 ) has not ( yet ) clarified the above controversy .",
    "gould & uza claim that these @xmath1 determinations are only _ upper limits , due to the inherent `` prompt response assumption '' employed ( , that no time delay exists between the blast of ionizing photons impinging upon the ring and the subsequent uv fluorescence ) .",
    "this fact has been used to reconcile the inferred sn  1987a - based @xmath1 with the lower value derived via the lmc s red clump and masers in ngc  4258 ( discussed below ) , which both yield @xmath418.25 .",
    "what is not appreciated in these arguments is the magnitude of the putative time delay needed .",
    "specifically , from equation  1 , @xmath39@xmath40mag for every day of `` delay '' , independent of @xmath32 .",
    "_    in practice , what this means is that to reconcile gould & uza s results ( assuming an intrinsically circular ring ) with @xmath0=18.25 , one would need to reduce @xmath31 from 378 to 357d ( , a time delay of 21d ) .",
    "the situation is even worse when attempting to reconcile panagia with @xmath1=18.25 ; in that case , @xmath31 would have to be reduced from 395 to 331d ( , a time delay of 64d ) .",
    "are delays of this enormous magnitude physically feasible ?",
    "i have not seen this particular scenario addressed , but an informal polling of my colleagues with experience in such fluorescence models suggests not - `` a few days '' was the most optimistic response , meaning the downward correction to @xmath1 could be no more than @xmath40.01@xmath240.02mag .",
    "relaxing the prompt - response assumption , therefore , does not appear to be the panacea it might at first appear to be .",
    "continuing to refer to the sn  1987a results as `` upper limits '' is somewhat misleading , in my opinion .      under the assumption that the mean @xmath41-band luminosity of red clump stars in the lmc matches those calibrated locally by hipparcos , udalski ( 1998b ) and stanek  ( 1998 ) found @xmath1@xmath4218.1 . cole ( 1998 )",
    "criticized these analyses on the basis that age and metallicity differences between the lmc and galactic red clump stars can not be neglected . by employing seidel  ( 1987 ) red clump models , evolved under the ( poor ) assumption of constant helium abundance and core mass ,",
    "cole claimed that udalski and stanek underestimated @xmath1 by 0.28mag .",
    "this extreme correction though is not supported by modern stellar evolution models ( , girardi  1998 ) .",
    "in fact , even in comparison with its contemporaries ( , vandenberg 1985 ; lattanzio 1986 ; sweigert & gross 1978 ) , the seidel  models are extreme .",
    "adoption of any of the other models of that era would have led to a predicted correction factor of 0.1@xmath60.1 , as opposed to the @xmath40.3 suggested by cole .",
    "empirically , stanek & garnavich ( 1998 ) show that the stellar populations in three m31 fields have identical @xmath41-band luminosities . considering the galactocentric distances of the fields ( 6.7 , 11.2 , and 33.6kpc ) with the zaritsky ( 1994 ) abundance gradient ( @xmath240.018dex / kpc )",
    ", one would predict an _ a priori metallicity differential of @xmath40.5dex , in agreement with each field s cmd ( holland  1996 ; rich  1996 ) . in the parlance of cole , this 0.5dex difference implies that there should be a 0.15@xmath60.05mag difference in the @xmath41-band luminosities of the inner and outer m31 field cmds - such a difference is not observed .",
    "further evidence to the minimal role played by age differences is provided in udalski ( 1998b ) , who showed that the @xmath41-band luminosities of lmc and smc clusters was independent of age ( for cluster ages of @xmath42@xmath2410gyrs ) . _    more recently , both zaritsky ( 1999 ) and romaniello  ( 1999 ) have suggested an upward revision of @xmath40.2mag be applied to all previous red clump determinations , based upon their more sophisticated treatment of dust in the lmc red clump fields . in response , udalski ( 1999 ) bypasses the complicated dust corrections favored by zaritsky and romaniello , by simply restricting the analysis to regions of low extinction , thereby obviating any complicated dust corrections .",
    "udalski also makes the point that the region in which romaniello  restricted their red clump analysis is unsuitable for red clump studies . of perhaps even greater importance , udalski culled from the hipparcos galactic red clump catalog , a large sample of stars _ with lmc metallicities ( from mcwilliam 1990 ) , thereby avoiding any potential galactic versus lmc stellar population mismatch pitfalls",
    "his result - @xmath1=18.23@xmath60.05 - appears to be the most solid empirical application of this technique possible , at this time . _",
    "romaniello  ( 1999 ) and sakai  ( 2000 ) have derived @xmath0@xmath4218.6@xmath2418.7 , based upon the apparent magnitude of the trgb , coupled with the assumption that the @xmath41-band luminosity of the trgb ( for the lmc s metallicity ) corresponds to m@xmath43 .",
    "udalski ( 1999 ) has already commented upon the suitability and photometric calibration of the field employed by romaniello . to reconcile",
    "the sakai  value of @xmath1=18.59 with @xmath1=18.25 would require m@xmath44 .      the geometry of the lmc eclipsing binary system hv  2274 has been used by guinan  ( 1998 ) to derive @xmath1=18.30@xmath60.07 .",
    "this technique , while not entirely geometrical ( local reddening estimates are required ) , remains one of the most promising .",
    "a graphic illustration of the importance of using the appropriate reddening comes from the fact that guinan  adopted a reddening of e(b@xmath24v)=0.12@xmath60.01 , while in contrast , nelson  ( 1999 ) derived a reddening of e(b@xmath24v)=0.09@xmath60.03 , leading to @xmath1=18.40@xmath60.07 .      under the assumption that @xmath1=18.50@xmath60.13 , maoz  ( 1999 ) derived a cepheid distance to ngc  4258 of 29.54@xmath60.12@xmath45@xmath60.18@xmath46 , where the subscripts r and s correspond to random and systematic uncertainties , respectively .",
    "conversely , herrnstein  ( 1999 ) derived a purely geometric distance to ngc  4258 of 29.29@xmath60.10@xmath45@xmath60.12@xmath46 , using the orbital motions of masers in the gas disk surrounding the galaxy s nucleus .",
    "unless some unappreciated flaw exists in either ( or both ) of these analyses , in order to reconcile the cepheid and maser distances , one must reduce @xmath1 from 18.50 to @xmath418.25 .",
    "to re - iterate points made earlier , it is clear from even a cursory examination of figure  1 that significant unappreciated systematic uncertainties exist in many of the published values of @xmath1 , as evident in the lack of overlap in the quoted uncertainties .",
    "i am loathe to pass judgment on the various entries shown in figure  1 , but will mention that those techniques deemed as `` geometric '' ( and , in principle , somewhat less susceptible to intermediate steps in going from galactic to lmc stellar populations ) , such as the eclipsing binary hv  2274 , the circumstellar ring around sn  1987a ( at least gould & uza s analysis ) , and the masers in ngc  4258 , all suggest @xmath0@xmath4218.3 . cepheids ( except for luri  1999 ) and subdwarf sequences still favor the long scale ( @xmath0@xmath4218.5@xmath2418.7 ) .",
    "i remain skeptical that our understanding of @xmath1 is accurate to 6% , as has been assumed in most cepheid - based extragalactic distance scale analyses , and would suggest that 13% is a fairer reflection of the present - day uncertainty .",
    "i stress that this 13% should _ not be construed in terms of any sort of gaussian confidence level ( , 1@xmath3 , etc . ) ; i do not currently support the use of @xmath1 distributions as useful statistical measures of the uncertainty in @xmath1 . _    future astrometric missions such as fame ( http://aa.usno.navy.mil/fame/ ) and sim ( http://sim.jpl.nasa.gov/ )",
    "should provide a definitive calibration for the absolute luminosities of galactic cepheid and rr  lyrae standard candles , and hopefully resolve the remaining discrepancies , one way or the other .",
    "i wish to thank both francesca dantona and roberto gallino for their assistance in ensuring that this contribution was included in these proceedings .",
    "helpful feedback from mike shull , dick mccray , bohdan paczynski , and andrzej udalski was likewise appreciated .",
