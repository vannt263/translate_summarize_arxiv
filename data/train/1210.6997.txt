    "the use of a universal bolometric correction @xmath35 is not consistent with the proposition that disk temperatures may differ considerably among agn .",
    "an alternative approach is to tune the value of  in the agnspec models so as to give the observed value of   for a given  bin .",
    "we have computed a set of models in this fashion , still assuming @xmath36 and @xmath73 .",
    "we find that for @xmath56 , the resulting model has a value  giving @xmath74 , so that the model differs little from the @xmath35 case .",
    "however , for the higher  bins , the value of @xmath75 implied by the agnspec fits increases progressively to a value of @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "( here we use the terminology   to refer to the original sdss quasar bins , even though the actual  of the models is now higher . )",
    "these models involve very large accretion rates which exceed the more conventional  based on @xmath35 by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "such large accretion rates put increased strain on available accretion supplies .",
    "they also give  much larger than , so that the inner radii of such disks would likely involve serious modifications due to radiation pressure and mass loss , as discussed below .",

    "these models are useful , nevertheless , because we may think of the nominal  spectrum bins as a sequencing procedure that gives us a set of sdss agn involving a large range in , even if there are ambiguities as to how well the nominal value agrees with the actual disk temperaure .",
    "because the models adjusted to @xmath78 have a greater range of  and  than the nominal models , they are expected to show even stronger trends in observational quantities sensitive to , such as continuum color and high ionization emission - line strength .",

    "the strong increase with the bin value of  is now even more pronounced and in greater contrast to the observed decrease .",

    "the hotter cases greatly overpredict the observed soft x - ray fluxes .",
    "clearly , the luminosity - fitting approach only exacerbates the discrepancy between the theoretical predictions and observations .",
    "however , this approach may have merit physically , since it avoids use of a universal bolometric correction .",
    "moreover , for the higher values of , the @xmath35 models severely underpredict the luminosity at @xmath32 .",
    "if the accretion rate is not increased , some restructuring of the agn continuum source is needed to channel energy more efficiently into the continuum at optical wavelengths . in any case , the standard thin - disk model requires some kind of modification to explain the continuum and emission - line observations .",
    "b07 found that observed continuum colors of sdss qsos did not become progressively bluer with increasing  in the manner predicted by the agnspec models .",
    "we suggested that this resulted from higher eddington ratios at higher , leading to departures from the standard thin disk model .",
    "this might involve thickening by radiation pressure , inefficient `` slim disk '' accretion , and mass loss in a radiation - driven wind ( see also deroches et al .",
    "2009 ) . as an estimate of the potential effect on the continuum colors , we computed agnspec models in which the inner disk was truncated inside the radius where radiation pressure gave a vertical scale height @xmath79 for the disk , relative to the radius , of @xmath80 .",
    "this led to improved agreement with the observed colors , in particular giving a non - monotonic trend of color with .    here",
    "we explore a more physical model in which the disk effective temperature is modified inside the critical radius .",
    "the basic idea , following @xcite and @xcite , is to take account of the luminosity produced at a given radius relative to .",
    "if the luminosity emitted by a wide annulus , , is well below , then the disk will not be severely thickened by radiation pressure , and standard disk physics applies . however , except near the inner boundary ,  increases with decreasing @xmath81 .",
    "for sufficiently large values of @xmath82 , a radius is reached where  reaches . near this radius , serious modifications of the disk structure can be anticipated .",
    "@xcite called this the `` spherization radius ''  on the basis that radiation pressure would severely thicken the disk .",
    "@xcite find that , inside , a combination of wind mass loss and advection occurs to a degree that keeps the local luminosity  close to .",
    "this results in a break in the run of effective temperature with radius , so that inside  one has @xmath83 rather than the standard dependence @xmath84 .",
    "this reduces the value of  actually reached in the inner disk as well as the luminosity radiated from the hottest parts of the disk .",
    "the value of  in units of the gravitational radius is approximately @xmath85 as  increases , the effective temperature at  actually decreases , following @xmath86 here we have used the newtonian expression for the local flux , omitting the normal factor of 3 increase in flux due to viscous transport of energy from smaller radii .",
    "this modification was found by @xcite because of energy loss in the inner disk due to advection and mass loss . for large values of",
    ", a luminosity @xmath87 is emitted in the vicinity of , and a similar luminosity is emitted per unit @xmath88 at smaller radii .",
    "thus  substantially controls the character of the emitted spectrum .",
    "hence , the fact that   _ decreases _ with increasing   once spherization comes into play is suggestive of the reversal in the trend of colors with  found in b07 .",
    "( note that , in this context ,   is defined in terms of the accretion rate entering the disk at large radii , and differs from the actual maximum temperature in the inner disk . )",
    "the potential for an inverse relationship between  and disk color temperature is strengthened if one considers the optical depth of the disk wind . in the case of highly super - eddington accretion , @xcite find that a large part of the inflowing material is expelled as a wind in the vicinity of . in the simple approximation of a spherical wind with constant radial velocity equal to the circular orbital velocity at , the optical depth of the wind , measured radially from , is @xmath89 .",
    "the optical depth in the wind , measured outward from some radius @xmath81 that exceeds , is @xmath90 . for the radius of the photosphere , where @xmath91 , this gives @xmath92 .",
    "the effective temperature at the photosphere is @xmath93 this raises the prospect that , for super - eddington accretion rates , the maximum visible disk temperature will be   rather than .",
    "an estimate of the progression of the disk temperature as it actually appears to the observer is then @xmath94 this assumes that there is enough absorption opacity in the wind to reprocess the emerging energy ; otherwise , the escaping spectrum may still be characterized by .    for our series 1 models above , with an accretion rate based on @xmath35 ,",
    "the value of  reaches -0.3 for @xmath77 . thus ,",

    "our focus has been on the entire sdss quasar data set , which is strongly dominated by radio quiet objects .",
    "however , radio loudness raises interesting questions regarding the black hole spin , which affects the inner disk boundary and thus the maximum temperature reached in the disk .",
    "numerous authors have discussed the possibility that radio loud agn have rapidly spinning black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
