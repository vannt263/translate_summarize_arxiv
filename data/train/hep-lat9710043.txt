    "the relation can be calculated by expanding both @xmath3 and @xmath2 in @xmath4 , the lattice bare coupling .",
    "this program is completed for @xmath5 @xcite where the two loop relation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 was required in order to avoid a significant source of error in the conversion to @xmath3 . in the @xmath0 case",
    "@xcite the remaining step is to compute the two loop coefficient between @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "this coefficient also enters into an extension of the program to include quenched quarks , which is discussed in martin lschers contribution to these proceedings .",

    "we have to calculate the perturbative coefficients depending on the box size @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is defined .",

    "the perturbative expansion has to be taken around the induced nonzero background field .",
    "since the propagators are not known analytically , we calculate them numerically for each @xmath19 and sum them up within each of the 13 diagrams@xcite .",
    "the use of symmetries ( for instance translation invariance and the cubic group in space ) in this context reduces the numerical effort .",
