    "the ionization of atoms and molecules by antiproton ( @xmath2 ) impacts has become the subject of great theoretical and experimental interest .",

    "again , a notable difference between proton and antiproton impacts could be seen for the ionization cross sections . while detailed work was done for proton impacts @xcite , little is investigated about the ionization of molecules by antiproton impact . in the case of @xmath2 + h@xmath6 collisions a calculation was done by ermolaev @xcite , who used an atomic hydrogen target with a scaled nuclear charge @xmath7 in order to mimic the h@xmath6 ionization potential .",

    "it can be seen that no crossings of the electron - spectra curves @xmath128 occur in this low electron - energy regime .",

    "in general the values of @xmath122 decrease for larger @xmath66 . however , the most striking feature of fig .

    "[ fig : spect_h2_p ] , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the occurring maxima can be explained with the simple picture of the electron - capture process where the electron is captured by the proton and moves basically with the momentum of the projectile .",
    "therefore , the velocity of the captured electron relative to the h@xmath6 molecule is given by the velocity of the projectile , namely the proton , as well as the electron velocity relative to the moving rest frame of the projectile .",

    "it may be mentioned that the capture peaks get much less pronounced for higher impact energies .",
    "this is , first , due to the diminishing probability of capture for larger @xmath68 and , second , due to a broader @xmath66 distribution of the captured electrons .    if the discussed maxima of @xmath122 in fig .  [ fig : spect_h2_3d]b are removed one is left with a smoothly decreasing electron - spectra surface @xmath141 for increasing @xmath66 which is similar to the one for antiproton impact in fig .",

    "first , it is obvious that the present results for ionization in + h@xmath30 collisions shown in fig.[fig : cs_h2 ] clearly deviate from those of ermolaev @xcite .",
    "it is astonishing that the latter results by ermolaev better match the present data for _ unscaled atomic _",
    "hydrogen than the present and experimental data for molecular hydrogen .",
    "no detailed information is given in @xcite concerning the employed basis set and the convergence of the calculations .",
    "in very similar studies by ermolaev @xcite , however , a two - center slater - type orbital expansion with 51 basis functions were applied to describe the collision process between @xmath3 and projectiles and ( unscaled ) hydrogen atom targets .",
    "it may be mentioned that the quality of the continuum description in the calculations by ermolaev has been put into question by other authors @xcite , especially in the so - called polarization region , i.e.  between @xmath147 and 500kev .",
    "second , the present ionization cross sections using @xmath21 and @xmath29 as target potentials both yield , especially for @xmath148kev , comparable results which can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : cs_h2_p ] and [ fig : cs_h2 ] for @xmath3 and impact , respectively .",
    "deviations become visible for @xmath95kev .",
    "the similar behavior may be explained with their comparable ionization potentials @xmath149at @xmath150 and @xmath151=0.5945 $ ]     third , the present cross sections for excitation in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_h2_ex ] differ , however , considerably for @xmath21 and @xmath145 . to the best of the authors",
    "knowledge no literature data exists to compare the present results with and therefore to judge which of both models is superior in describing excitation of h@xmath6 molecules .",
    "on the other hand it has been observed that the excitation cross sections of alkali - metal atoms depend considerably on the energy difference @xmath152 between the energetically lowest dipole - allowed @xmath3 states and the ground states @xcite , i.e. , the excitation energy . in this context , it shall be noted that also in the present investigation the dipole - allowed transitions from the ground state to the bound states with angular momentum @xmath109 , namely the @xmath3 states , play , especially for @xmath148kev , a dominant role .",
    "the cross sections for excitations into bound @xmath109 states are also shown in fig.[fig : cs_h2_ex ] for @xmath21 as thin short - dashed curve and @xmath29 as thin dash - double - dotted curve . in @xcite",
    "the excitation energies @xmath153 for dipole - allowed transitions are compared for the two models @xmath145 and @xmath21 .",
    "therein , it turns out that the excitation energies calculated with @xmath145 are smaller than those for @xmath21 throughout the @xmath10 range which is considered here .",
    "the substantial differences of the excitation cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs_h2_ex ] can therefore be understood by considering the diversity of the @xmath153 curves for both model potentials , namely , the lower excitation energies for @xmath145 lead to larger excitation cross sections compared to those of @xmath21 .    in order to find out how well the excitation is described by the employed models the excitation - energy curves obtained with @xmath21 can also be compared with the @xmath154 curves of exact h@xmath6 calculations .",
    "for such a comparison it has to be considered that the h@xmath6 molecule can be oriented arbitrarily in a collision .",
    "therefore , transitions from the h@xmath6 ground state to states with the molecular symmetries @xmath155 and @xmath156 are both dipole - allowed .",
    "the molecules are oriented statistically @xmath157 perpendicular and @xmath158 parallel to the projectile momentum .",
    "consequently , the sum of accordingly weighted excitation energies , namely , @xmath159 , should be compared to the excitation energy of the model @xmath21 for transitions into @xmath3 states .",
    "the comparison for the whole @xmath10 range considered in the present work was done in @xcite and yielded a good agreement between the considered excitation energies of the model and the exact h@xmath6 molecule .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that also the present excitation cross sections calculated with the model @xmath21 are superior to those calculated with @xmath145 . for high impact energies the results of the model",
    "@xmath21 may even match the excitation cross sections for exact h@xmath6 molecules completely .",
    "it shall be emphasized that @xmath21 depends only on one parameter @xmath9 which is determined by the ionization potential .",
    "there are no additional parameters in order to fit the energies or wave functions of excited states .",
    "therefore , it is remarkable that in spite of the simplicity of the model potential @xmath21 it is possible to reproduce cross sections reasonable well for ionization and excitation of h@xmath6 molecules in strong laser fields @xcite as well as in collisions with antiprotons .",
    "time - dependent close - coupling calculations of ionization and excitation cross sections for antiproton and proton collisions with molecular hydrogen have been performed in a wide impact - energy range from 8 to 4000kev .",
    "the target molecule is treated as an effective one - electron system using a model potential which provides the correct ground - state ionization potential for a fixed internuclear distance and behaves like the pure coulomb potential of a hydrogen atom for large @xmath160 .",
    "the total wave function is expanded in a one - center approach in eigenfunctions of the one - electron model hamiltonian of the target .",
    "the radial part of the basis functions is expanded in b - spline functions and the angular part in a symmetry - adapted sum of spherical harmonics .",
    "the collision process is described with the help of the classical trajectory approximation .",
    "it was found that the ionization cross sections depend approximately linear on @xmath10 in the interval @xmath161   the dependence of @xmath71 on @xmath10 diminishes with higher energies .",
    "cross sections which account for the vibrational motion of the h@xmath6 nuclei can be obtained by employing closure , exploiting the linear behavior of @xmath71 , and performing the calculations at @xmath162     the results of the calculations for electron loss in @xmath3 + h@xmath6 collisions agree with experimental and theoretical data indicating the applicability of the used method .",
    "the present ionization cross sections for + h@xmath6 collisions agree for @xmath163kev with the experiment .",
    "for @xmath164kev the magnitude of the calculated @xmath74 is still comparable to the experimental data , though both curves start to have a different slope .",
    "the calculated excitation cross sections for + h@xmath6 collisions were found to be very similar to those for the excitation of a single hydrogen atom by antiproton impact .",
    "an electron - energy spectrum surface @xmath122 for + h@xmath6 collisions is presented for a wide electron - energy range @xmath165  and for impact energies @xmath166kev . in the interval @xmath167the electron - spectrum curves",
    "@xmath128 for fixed impact energies @xmath68 are smooth curves which do not cross .",
    "the @xmath128 curves are ordered according to the corresponding impact energy with decreasing magnitude for increasing @xmath68 . for higher @xmath66 crossings of the @xmath128 occur .",
    "thereby , it is always the uppermost curve which crosses all lower lying spectrum curves @xmath128 which belong to larger @xmath68 .",
    "the present electron - energy spectrum surface @xmath122 for @xmath3 + h@xmath6 collisions also includes the electron - capture by the projectile which manifests itself in local maxima of the spectrum curves @xmath128 for a given impact energy .",
    "the position of the peaks of @xmath128 is given by @xmath168 .",
    "a comparison of the used model potential @xmath21 with a scaled hydrogen atom with comparable ionization potential yields similar ionization cross sections .",
    "therefore , the ionization process appears to be mainly depending on the ionization potential .",
    "the cross sections for excitation , however , differ notably which may be explained with the differing binding energies of the dipole - allowed bound states in both models . since the excitation energies of the lowest @xmath3 states of the model @xmath21 coincide with the statistically - weighted dipole - allowed excitation energies for the h@xmath6 molecule the model @xmath21 is considered to be superior to the description with a scaled hydrogen atom .    concerning the applicability of the used model potential @xmath21 it was demonstrated that it is suitable for describing ionization in + h@xmath6 collisions at impact energies @xmath169kev .",
    "furthermore , the model is capable of determining the dependence of the cross sections on the internuclear distance .",
    "even the calculation of excitation cross sections seems to be meaningful .",
    "thereby , it has to be emphasized that besides the one parameter @xmath9 which is directly determined by the ionization potential no additional parameter is included in the potential in order to fit the energies or wave functions to those of the correct electronic states . on the other hand ,",
    "not all effects which may be of increasing importance at low impact energies can be described by the model .",
    "first , the influence of a second electron is solely incorporated as a screening , second , no dependence on the molecular orientation during the collision is allowed for and third , vibrational excitation which also includes dissociation is not considered .",
    "therefore , it would be eligible to perform full calculations which take the molecular properties of the target as well as the two - electron effects , like double ionization or ionization excitation , into account .",
    "such a theoretical effort , which is currently in preparation , accompanied with precise measurements at low antiproton energies would lead to a better understanding of the + h@xmath6 collision process for @xmath95kev .",
