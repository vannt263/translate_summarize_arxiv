    "since the discovery of the four laws of black hole mechanics , black holes are widely believed to be thermodynamic objects assigned standard thermodynamic variables such as the temperature and entropy @xcite . even though the exact statistical description of black hole microstates is still unclear , the study of the thermodynamic properties of black holes has been a fascinating topic .",
    "these black holes are found to possess the interesting phase transition , for example the hawking - page phase transition @xcite , and critical phenomena as seen in normal thermodynamic systems .    motivated by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , where the transitions have been related with the holographic superconductivity @xcite , the subject that the phase transitions of black holes in asymptotically anti de - sitter ( ads ) spacetime , has received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "the underlying microscopic statistical interaction of the black holes is also expected to be understood via the study of the gauge theory living on the boundary in the gauge / gravity duality .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite studied the phase transitions and critical phenomena for the reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) black hole in @xmath2-dimensional ads spacetime ; they found that the black hole systems is similar to a van der waals liquid gas system .",
    "the critical exponents near a van der waals - like critical point were found to be the same as the liquid gas system .",
    "especially , near the critical point , the @xmath3-@xmath4 diagram was presented , sharing the same shape as that of @xmath5-@xmath6 diagram for a van der waals liquid gas system , which strongly suggests a remarkable analogy between these two thermodynamic systems . almost at the same time , the similar critical behavior was found in the kerr - ads black hole @xcite .",
    "different from the rn - ads black hole , there are two van der waals - like critical points identified at different temperatures .",
    "the critical phenomena of born - infeld ads black holes and higher curvature charged ads black holes were investigated in @xcite , where the critical exponents were also examined . treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate quantity as a thermodynamic volume , the critical behavior and @xmath5-@xmath6 criticality of a charged ads black hole",
    "is reexamined @xcite . and",
    "a complete analogy between the black hole and the liquid - gas system was established @xcite .    in a separate context ,",
    "a geometrical perspective of thermodynamics has been a subject of great interest for several decades . following the development of the extrinsic geometrical perspective of thermodynamics @xcite , weinhold @xcite proposed an intrinsic geometrical perspective defined in the energy representation on the space of the equilibrium thermodynamic states of a system .",
    "however , this geometry can not be well interpreted from the physical view . on the other hand",
    ", ruppeiner @xcite constructed an intrinsic riemannian geometry in the entropy representation , which is found to be related to the probability measuring the thermodynamic fluctuations connecting two equilibrium states .",
    "it is also suggested that the scalar curvature produced from this geometry contains the information of the phase transitions and critical phenomena , and it shares the same divergent behavior as the heat capacity of that thermodynamic system .    also , ruppeiner pointed out that the sign of the curvature may be an indicator of the interactions among the microscopic structure of the thermodynamic system @xcite .",
    "for example , the curvature is positive for the repulsive interaction , and negative for the attractive interaction , which correspond to the ideal gas of fermions and bosons , respectively @xcite . as we know",
    ", there is attractive interaction among the microscopic particles for the van der waals system , which implies a negative curvature . and the result is true , the curvature for that thermodynamic system is negative and goes to negative infinity at the critical point .",
    "it is suggested that the negative divergent behavior of the curvature is related to the bose - einstein condensation , and the positive divergent behavior is related to the pauli s exclusion principle .    among the gravity theories with higher derivative curvature terms ,",
    "the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) gravity has some special features and gives rise to some interesting effects on the thermodynamics of black holes in ads space @xcite .",
    "the phase structure of a gb - ads black hole was briefly studied in @xcite . and in the grand canonical ensemble , the local and global thermal phase structure of a charged asymptotically ads black hole with both gb and quartic field strength corrections were thoroughly researched @xcite .    in this paper , we will study the phase transition and critical behavior of charged topological gb black holes in @xmath0-dimensional ads spacetime .",
    "motivated by the idea that the cosmological constant @xmath1 can be regarded as a thermodynamic variable @xcite , we leave it free to vary and study the phase structures and critical phenomena for the gb - ads black hole in the canonical ensemble .",
    "the result strongly suggests that the phase structures and critical phenomena drastically depend on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "then we examine the thermodynamic analogy between a charged gb - ads black hole and a van der waals liquid gas system .",
    "the @xmath3-@xmath4 criticality is investigated , which is analogous to the @xmath5-@xmath6 criticality of a van der waals system .",
    "the critical exponents are calculated and found to be the same as that of van der waals liquid gas system .",
    "moreover , we explore the phase transitions and possible property among the microstructure of a charged gb - ads black hole from the viewpoint of geometrical perspective of equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we find the scalar curvature diverges precisely at the divergent points where the heat capacity diverges .",
    "this black hole system is also found to be a multiple system , i.e. , it is similar to the ideal gas of fermions in some range of the parameters , while similar to the ideal gas of bosons in another range . and",
    "both the phenomena of bose - einstein condensation and pauli s exclusion are expected to be observed in such thermodynamic system .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner . in sec .",
    "[ thermodynamics ] , we review some thermodynamic properties of the charged gb - ads black hole . for different values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",

    "the action of the @xmath0-dimensional spacetime in einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity with a negative cosmological constant @xmath7 has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gb coupling constant with dimension @xmath10 and it is regarded as the inverse string tension with positive value . the gb lagrangian @xmath11 and",

    "the parameter @xmath29 and @xmath30 are corresponded to the gravitational mass @xmath31 and charge @xmath3 , respectively , as @xmath32 for this black hole solution , the horizon radius @xmath33 is determined by the equation @xmath34 .",
    "then the gravitational mass can be reexpressed as @xmath35 for the metric ( [ metric ] ) to be free from conical singularity at @xmath36 , we get the temperature @xmath37 of the black hole @xmath38 as we known , an extremal black hole has a vanishing temperature @xmath37 .",
    "so , solving @xmath39 , one can obtain @xmath40 the range of @xmath41 represents the non - black hole case , i.e. , naked singularity .",
    "so , we will only focus on the range of @xmath42 in this paper .",
    "the potential difference between the horizon and infinity is @xmath43 by employing the first law of black hole thermodynamics , we obtain the entropy for the black hole : @xmath44 the gibbs free energy defined as @xmath45 is @xmath46 another important thermodynamical quantity measuring the stability against small perturbation is the heat capacity @xmath47 at constant charge , defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 from ( [ heatcapacity ] ) , we see that the heat capacity @xmath47 vanishes for an extremal black hole ( @xmath39 ) . while , for a nonextremal black hole , @xmath47 is nonvanishing . in general ,",
    "the local stability is determined by the heat capacity , which states that the positive heat capacity can guarantee a stable black hole to exist , while the negative one will make the black hole disappear when a small perturbation is included within . moreover , solving @xmath50 , we get the divergent point of the heat capacity , which is @xmath51 the parameter @xmath52 , which is related to the isothermal compressibility is @xmath53^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the thermodynamic identity @xmath54 is used . using ( [ tempature ] ) and ( [ phi ] )",
    ", we get @xmath55 with @xmath56 from ( [ kt ] ) , one easily obtains the result that @xmath57 diverges exactly at the points where the heat capacity @xmath47 diverges and vanishes at @xmath58 .",
    "a similar result also holds for the kerr - newman black hole @xcite , and born - infeld ads black hole @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that , thermodynamic properties of the black hole closely depend on the hypersurface parameter @xmath25 and the dimension of the spacetime @xmath0 .",
    "so in the following , we will discuss these cases , respectively . and",
    "without loss of generality , we take the choice @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "in this section , we will study the phase structure for the black hole of different @xmath25 and @xmath0 in the canonical ensemble with the charge @xmath3 fixed .      in this case",
    ", the divergence condition ( [ qccondition ] ) for the heat capacity @xmath47 will reduce to @xmath62 - 2r_{h}^{4}(r_{h}^{2}+6 ) }     { ( 2d-5)r_{h}^{2}+2(2d-7)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath63 , this condition becomes @xmath64 from above , we find @xmath65 is negative for an arbitrary value of @xmath33 .",
    "so , the heat capacity @xmath47 of a five - dimensional black hole is always regular , which implies that there is no phase transition points related to the divergent points of @xmath47 .    for @xmath66",
    ", the condition reduces to @xmath67 in this case , it is clear that the divergent behavior of the heat capacity depends crucially on the cosmological constant @xmath1 . after a detail examination , we find that the heat capacity @xmath47 has two different behaviors for @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "[ pcqk1 ] , we plot the heat capacity @xmath47 for the @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "case 1 : @xmath68 . from fig .",
    "[ cqk1a ] , we can see that , for small value of charge @xmath3 , with the increase of @xmath33 , the heat capacity first goes to positive infinity at where we denote as @xmath72 .",
    "then it increases from negative infinity to a finite negative value and back to negative infinity at @xmath73 . and at last , it decreases from positive infinity to a finite positive value and then monotonically increases to infinity at @xmath74 . from the above analysis",
    ", it is quite evident that the heat capacity @xmath47 is positive for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , while it is negative for @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , @xmath47 suffers discontinuities at @xmath78 , which correspond to the phase transition points of the charged gb - ads black holes .",
    "the point @xmath72 corresponds to the transition that a small stable black hole with @xmath79 to an intermediate unstable one with @xmath80 .",
    "and the point @xmath81 corresponds to an intermediate unstable black hole to a large stable one . on the other hand , for the large value of charge @xmath3 ,",
    "the divergent behavior vanishes and the black hole is in a stable phase . to better understand the divergent behaviors of the heat capacity , we plot the divergent point in the @xmath82 plane in fig .",
    "[ qdk1a ] .",
    "the shadow region in this figure has a negative temperature , which represents a non - black hole case , and we will not discuss it here . from it , we see that , for @xmath83 , there exist two divergent points @xmath72 and @xmath81 ; for @xmath84 , the two divergent points coincide with each other at @xmath85 ; and for @xmath86 , the divergent point disappears",
    ". therefore , @xmath87 corresponds to a critical phase transition point and it is a local maxima along this divergent curve .",
    "case 2 : @xmath69 . in this case",
    ", @xmath47 has a complex structure ; see fig .",
    "[ cqk1b ] . on one hand , like the case 1 , the small and larger black holes are in thermally stable phase , while the intermediate black hole is unstable . on the other hand , from the fig .",
    "[ qdk1b ] describing the divergent behavior in the @xmath82 plane , one finds that there exist two local maxima located at @xmath88 , @xmath89 and one local minimum located at @xmath90 . for a small charge , there are two divergent points .",
    "when @xmath91 , we have three divergent points located at @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath3 further increases , the divergent point at @xmath94 is split into two .",
    "one coincides with @xmath95 at @xmath96 , and the other one meets @xmath89 at @xmath97 . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the divergent point disappears .",
    "moreover , we have the following relations , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "it is also worth noting that , @xmath95 will meet @xmath94 at @xmath101 .",
    "here @xmath90 , @xmath95 , and @xmath89 are corresponded to the different critical phase transition points . in order to study the @xmath3-@xmath4 criticality",
    ", we list the numerical values of the thermodynamic quantities at the critical points in table .",
    "[ criticalparameters ] .",
    "this critical behavior is very interesting and different from the rn - ads @xcite , and bi - ads cases @xcite , where only one critical point located at the maximum was found . and",
    "it is also different from the kerr - ads black hole @xcite .",
    "here we have three critical points , and two of them have the same temperature .    for @xmath102 , the heat capacity and its divergent behavior are almost the same as that shown in figs .",
    "[ cqk1a ] and [ qdk1a ] , for an arbitrary value of the cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "we also list the critical parameters @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and radius @xmath107 of the extremal black hole in table [ criticalparameters ] . from it",
    ", we can see that the critical parameters @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath106 increase with the dimensionality @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath106 vary slowly with @xmath0 , while @xmath104 increases quickly when @xmath0 increases .",
    "compared with them , the critical potential @xmath105 has a complicated behavior , i.e. , it first decreases , and then increases , and at last decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "it is also worth noting that , for different @xmath0 , we always have @xmath108 , which implies that these critical phenomena correspond to the nonextremal black hole , and it is a nontrivial phase transition .",
    ".the values of these critical parameters @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and the extremal black hole radius @xmath107 for different dimensionality @xmath0 , and cosmological constant @xmath1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here , some notes on the @xmath3-@xmath4 criticality is necessary .",
    "it is clear that this case is similar as @xmath61 , @xmath66 , and @xmath109 , which have two local maxima and one local minimum . and after some tedious calculations",
    ", we find the @xmath3-@xmath4 diagram near the local maxima indeed shares the same shape as shown in fig .",
    "[ pqphit ] , only with different critical values of the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "however , for the critical point located at @xmath110 , there is no such @xmath3-@xmath4 criticality , which may be mainly due to the fact that there is no closed loop surrounding the critical point when the range of @xmath41 is excluded . and",
    "more research about this point should be carried out in the future .",
    "it is also worth noting that these two critical points located at the maxima have different values of temperature , so they are on the different isotherm of a gb - ads black hole .",
    "from above discussion , we find that the @xmath3-@xmath4 criticality of a gb - ads black hole near the critical point at the critical isotherm has an analogy as the @xmath5-@xmath6 criticality of a van der waals liquid gas system .",
    "so we first give a brief introduction to the critical exponents for a van der waals liquid gas system and then apply it to the charged gb - ads black hole .",
    "near the critical point at the critical isotherm , the critical behavior of a van der waals liquid gas system can be described with the following critical exponents",

    "the critical exponents have the following values : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .",
    "now , let us turn to study these critical exponents for the gb - ads black hole . in order to examine the neighborhood of the critical point",
    ", we introduce the expansion parameters @xmath126 the index @xmath127 denotes different critical points shown in sec . [ critical ] .",
    "note that the critical point located at @xmath110 is a special one , so we will not consider it here . using ( [ tempature ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) , we have @xmath128 then substituting ( [ small ] ) into ( [ tqphi ] ) , we get @xmath129 where @xmath130 . with detailed calculation",
    ", we always have @xmath131 this result holds for any values of @xmath25 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 . and",
    "other coefficients @xmath132 have different values for different critical points . for an example , the expansion coefficients for the critical point located at @xmath133 are @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 .    in the neighborhood of the critical points , we have ( [ pi ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath141 on either side of the coexistence curve can be found from the conditions that along the isotherm , @xmath142 this is just the maxwell equal - area law .",
    "and the indices @xmath143 and @xmath144 represent two different phases of the thermodynamics system . from the first condition ( [ condition1 ] ) , we derive @xmath145 where we have denoted @xmath146 and @xmath147 for different phases .",
    "the second condition ( [ condition2 ] ) reduces to @xmath148 requiring that ( [ aaa ] ) is consistent with ( [ bbb ] ) , we have @xmath149 therefore @xmath150 which implies that the degree of the coexistence curve @xmath151 let @xmath152 , ( [ pi ] ) will be of the form @xmath153 thus we get the degree of the critical isotherm @xmath154 with ( [ tempature ] ) , ( [ phi ] ) , and ( [ entropy ] ) , the heat capacity at fixed @xmath4 is @xmath155 from above equation , we see that @xmath156 has no singular behavior at these critical points , while it is singular at @xmath58 .",
    "thus the heat capacity exponent @xmath157 the isothermal compressibility can be expressed as @xmath158 when @xmath159 ( or @xmath160 ) , one approaches the critical point along the critical isochore . then set @xmath161 , we get @xmath162 thus the isothermal compressibility exponent @xmath163 when @xmath164 ( or @xmath165 ) , one approaches the critical point along the coexistence curve . then set @xmath166 , and we have @xmath167 and the isothermal compressibility exponent @xmath168 with these results ,",
    "these critical exponents are found to satisfy the following relations , known as the thermodynamic scaling laws , @xmath169 when sufficiently close to the critical points @xmath170 , the gibbs free energy for a gb - ads black hole may expand as @xmath171_{ci}+\\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial g }                  { \\partial t}\\bigg)_{\\phi}\\bigg]_{ci}(t - t_{ci } )              + \\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial g }                { \\partial \\phi}\\bigg)_{t}\\bigg]_{ci}(\\phi-\\phi_{ci})\\nonumber\\\\             & + \\frac{1}{2 }               \\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g }                 { \\partial t^{2}}\\bigg)_{\\phi}\\bigg]_{ci}(t - t_{ci})^{2 }             + \\frac{1}{2}\\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g }              { \\partial \\phi^{2}}\\bigg)_{t}\\bigg]_{ci}(\\phi-\\phi_{ci})^{2}+ ... \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the thermodynamics law of this black hole @xmath172 , we have @xmath173 since the entropy and charge are regular for any values of these parameters , the singular part of gibbs free energy can be expressed as @xmath174 express it with the small parameters @xmath175 and @xmath176 , we derive @xmath177 from ( [ gg ] ) , we find @xmath178 with @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 a real number .",
    "this strongly suggests that the generalized homogeneous function hypothesis holds for this charged gb - ads black hole , which means that , close to these critical points , the singular part of the gibbs free energy is a generalized homogeneous function .",

    "the range of the positive sign is similar to the ideal gas of fermions , whose curvature is found to be positive and positive diverges at absolute zero @xcite , which can be understood with the pauli s exclusion principle forbidding two particles in the same state with unlimited repulsive force @xcite . while the range of the negative sign is similar to the ideal gas of bosons , whose curvature is negative and goes to negative infinity at absolute zero , it appeared as bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "this property is unlike the van der waals liquid gas system , whose ruppeiner curvature is nonpositive for different range of the parameters , which means repulsive force can not exist in such thermodynamics system . while for the gb - ads black hole , it has a multiple phenomena , both the repulsive force and attractive force are allowed , depending on the values of these parameters .",

    "but there may be another type of phase transition associated with a scalar hair in the planar case @xcite .",
    "moreover , using the state space scalar curvature , we study the phase transition and explore the possible interaction among the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "the ruppeiner curvature constructed in this paper shares the same divergent behavior as the heat capacity @xmath47 , which implies that the information of phase transition is contained in the curvature .",
    "different from the van der waals system , where the ruppeiner curvature is always negative , the curvature for the gb - ads black hole can be negative or positive , possibly produced by the attractive force or repulsive force . and along the divergent curve , it changes the sign , which indicates it has multistructures of the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "although we still do not understand the microscopic structure of the horizon of a black hole , the phase structure and the state space scalar curvature may provide a useful probe to study the inner degrees of freedom of the horizon .",
