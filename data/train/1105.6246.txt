    "the study of the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) is central in the investigation of solids  @xcite , since , apart from the structure , it is probably the most relevant and direct quantity to characterize a system .",
    "e.g. , within the harmonic approximation , the vdos ( which we will denote by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the frequency ) , allows one to calculate the temperature dependence of the specific heat , thermal conductivity , as well as the free energy .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the vdos of _ disordered _ systems shows anomalies , i.e. has features which are not observed in crystalline systems .",
    "a well - known example is the vdos of fractal aggregates for which one finds that @xmath1 shows at low @xmath2 a power - law dependence with a fractal exponent , instead of the typical debye law @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the dimensionality of space  @xcite .",
    "deviations from the debye law are also often observed in atomic and molecular glasses and have been in the focus of interest of many studies  @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable anomaly is an excess in the number of modes , as compared to the debye prediction , at low frequencies ( i.e.  for an atomic system in the thz range ) , a feature which is commonly named `` boson peak '' and which is responsible for the anomalous behavior in the specific heat or thermal conductivity of glasses  @xcite .",
    "although some evidence has been provided for the existence of a correlation between the fragility of a glass - forming system and the strength of its boson peak , other results suggest that no such correlation exists  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that this correlation has a structural origin @xcite , since strong glass - formers have an open network structure ( due to the presence of directional / ionic bonds ) and tend to have a strong boson peak , while fragile liquids have a structure that is similar to the one of the hard sphere system , i.e. van der waals like interactions , and usually a weak boson peak .",
    "similar results have been found in the se@xmath5as@xmath6 system for which neutron scattering shows that the number of low frequency modes is related to the average coordination number of the atoms  @xcite .",
    "while much effort has been devoted to the investigation of dense glasses , much less is know for the case of thermoreversible gels , i.e.  disordered arrested states at low densities  @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that the realistic modeling of thermoreversible gels has become possible only recently  @xcite .",
    "models include patchy particles of low valence , particles interacting via competing short and long range interactions , three - body potentials , dipolar particles , and others  @xcite . in all these models",
    ", the interaction potential makes that the particles have only a small coordination number which in turn allows to generate very open disordered structures , composed by chains of bi - coordinated particles joined by a small number of three- ( or more ) coordinated particles which act as junctions in the network . in the last years",
    "the structural and relaxational properties of these thermoreversible gel models have been extensively investigated in the attempt to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the slowing down of the dynamics with decreasing temperature and to clarify the differences between gels and glasses  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we extend this line of investigations and focus on the vdos of one of these models , a binary mixture of particles with , respectively , two and three attractive patches . by changing the relative composition of the mixture",
    "we can change in a controlled way the structural properties of the system  @xcite and , in particular , the length of the bi - functional chains connecting the three - functional particles .",
    "this flexibility will allow us to study how a change of the structure influences the properties of the vdos as well as the behavior of the system at low frequencies , where a strong coupling between rotational and translational degrees of freedom is found .",
    "the model used in the present study has been presented in detail in ref .",
    "hence we provide here only the necessary amount of information required to make the article self - contained .",
    "the particles are modeled as spherical rigid bodies of diameter @xmath7 and mass @xmath8 .",
    "the surface of particle @xmath9 is decorated with @xmath10 sticky spots called patches .",
    "these patches are located at a distance @xmath11 from the particle s center of mass . the total interaction between particles @xmath9 and @xmath12",
    "is    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the interaction between the centers of mass of the two particles , while @xmath15 is the potential acting between the patches .",
    "so the total potential of the system is @xmath16 .",
    "we have chosen    @xmath17    and    @xmath18 \\quad , \\label{eq : patchy_potential}\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the distance between the centers of mass of particles @xmath9 and @xmath12 and @xmath20 is the distance between patch @xmath21 on particle @xmath9 and patch @xmath22 on particle @xmath12 . with this choice of parameters ,",
    "the resulting potential resembles a hard sphere potential complemented by an attractive square well - like potential if patches on different particles are close to each other .",
    "in addition , the very short range of @xmath23 guarantees that the so - called `` single bond per patch condition '' is fulfilled .",
    "this condition means that the maximum number of possible bonds that particle @xmath9 can form is equal to @xmath10 , and it allows to make an analytical description of the structural and dynamical properties of the model  @xcite . by choosing @xmath24",
    ", one finds that the depth of the @xmath25 potential is @xmath26 .",
    "the studied system is a binary mixtures of @xmath27 bi - functional particles , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 three functional particles , @xmath30 , with @xmath31 at packing fraction @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the total volume of the system .",
    "patches are arranged on the poles for particles with two patches ( bi - functional particles ) and equally spaced on the equator for particles with three patches ( three functional particles ) .",
    "we have studied six different systems having the following concentrations of bi - functional particles @xmath34 : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "this gives us the possibility to investigate how the average valence @xmath41 influences the structure and the vibrational properties of the system . in the following",
    ", energy is measured in units of @xmath42 , distance in units of @xmath7 , and time in units of @xmath43 .",
    "temperature , @xmath44 , is measured in units of energy , setting the boltzmann constant @xmath45 .",
    "the configurations we analyze were generated via brownian dynamics  @xcite by equilibrating the systems at @xmath46 ( a @xmath44 at which essentially most of the possible bonds have already been formed ) and by quenching the final equilibrium configurations to @xmath47 .",
    "the simulation at @xmath47 is performed until the few remaining isolated monomers attach to the spanning cluster .",
    "indeed , at such a low temperature , the probability of breaking a bond , proportional to @xmath48 , is of order @xmath49 and hence no bond breaking occurs during the simulation ( @xmath50 time steps , where each time step correspond to @xmath51 ) .",
    "we stress that , in the resulting structure , all the particles belong to the same cluster and the connectivity of the system is not altered by the dynamics , i.e. in the following we study only the vibrational dynamics and not relaxation and thus the system can be considered as a chemical gel . note that this vibrational dynamics is not harmonic since the system is able to overcome local barriers , but which are not associated to bond breaking events .      we have computed the normal modes and eigenfrequencies of the system by determining the properties of the local potential energy minimum configuration @xmath52 , i.e. a configuration for which @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are the generalized coordinates ( center of mass positions and orientational angles ) .",
    "this local minimum was obtained by taking a configuration of the system as a starting point of a minimization procedure in the potential energy @xmath55 and the so obtained local minimum is @xmath52 .",
    "( note that this minimum configuration is often also called `` inherent structure '' ( is )  @xcite . ) in practice we have used a conjugate gradient algorithm  @xcite which is here a fast procedure since the system needs only to relax the thermal fluctuations without altering the connectivity of the system .    within the harmonic approximation",
    ", the local minimum of @xmath55 can be written as a bilinear form in @xmath56 and @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the number of degrees of freedom and    @xmath60    the eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath61 give the normal modes of our system and the square root of the eigenvalues give the eigenfrequencies .",
    "the normalized distribution of the latter is thus the vdos @xmath1 .    to compute the hessian @xmath61 at the",
    "is we have used a finite difference method . since bifunctional particles have patches located on the poles ,",
    "only two angles are needed to identify the direction of the axis that joins them .",
    "this lowers the total number of degrees of freedom from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .",
    "the subsequent diagonalization was performed using the lapack package .",
    "to improve the statistics we have averaged over @xmath64 configurations .",
    "although these configurations are not independent ( since they share the same network topology ) , this averaging significantly smooths the vdos .",
    "we associate such improvement to sampling of the several secondary minima composing the same metabasin  @xcite .",
    "the networks studied in this article are composed by chains of bi - functional particles that are cross - linked by the three functional particles , acting as hinges between the chains .",
    "since bonds do not break during the time scale of the simulation , the system behaves as an almost fully connected chemical gel  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of tuning the concentration of junctions allows us to generate structure that have different chain lengths .",
    "specifically , the average chain length , i.e. the average number of bi - functional particles between two three functional ones ( a length that is related to the average distance between branching points of the network ) is given by  @xcite    @xmath65    for the smallest value of @xmath0 studied here we have thus @xmath66 , while for the largest we obtain @xmath67 . the ability to predict theoretically @xmath68",
    "is made possible by the fact that the structure is essentially generated from an equilibrium configuration and hence can be quite accurately described by the theory of flory and stockmayer@xcite .    to provide a visual representation of the networks generated for different values of the mean connectivity @xmath69",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] two snapshots of the systems with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where the most mobile particles are highlighted  @xcite . from the figure we recognize that for @xmath0 small , i.e. high connectivity , the system seems to be more heterogeneous than if @xmath0 is large .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the former case the coexistence curve is closer to the investigated state point and thus fluctuations are larger  @xcite .",
    "furthermore we see that for small average connectivity the most mobile particles form chains whereas for small @xmath0 their spatial distribution seems to be rather random .",
    "it is evident that the chain - like structure found at low connectivity will give rise to low frequency modes in the vdos , and below we will discuss this in more detail .     for @xmath70 ( a ) and @xmath71 ( b ) .",

    "there is one peak and a long tail . with increasing @xmath0",
    "a new peak appears while the minimum between the peaks becomes more pronounced but remains at the same position ( @xmath74 ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] . for small @xmath0",
    "the vdos has one main peak at small frequencies and a tail that extents to high @xmath2 . with intermediate and large @xmath0",
    "the vdos displays two peaks , one located for @xmath75 and one centered around @xmath76 , followed by a broad tail extending up to @xmath77 .",
    "apart from the case @xmath70 ( corresponding to @xmath78 ) , which shows a clear decrease in the number of low frequency eigenmodes , no significant dependence on @xmath0 is observed in the fraction of modes contributing to the two main peaks and to the tail of the vdos .",
    "this suggests that increasing the length of the chains does not strongly influence the total number of modes in the vdos at low frequencies , but only the shape of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , with increasing @xmath0 , the low frequency peak moves to lower frequencies and increases its height while the peak at intermediate frequencies becomes better resolved and a shoulder appears at @xmath79 . for completeness",
    ", we note that a shoulder is also present in the low frequency peak ( @xmath80 ) , which turns into a minor peak when @xmath71 .",
    "note that the peak at low @xmath2 is observed at frequencies that are significantly smaller than the _ typical _ frequencies of the model , which are on the order of unity ( due to the choice of the units ) .",
    "since the mentioned peak occurs at frequencies that are by a factor of 3 - 10 times smaller , we can tentatively identify this peak as a boson peak . from the figure",
    "we thus can conclude that there is a clear correlation between the _ structure _ of the system ( open vs. compact network ) and the height of the peak ( high / low ) .    to better understand the nature of the oscillations in the different regions of the spectrum , we study the _ participation ratio _ , @xmath81 , of each mode @xmath9 .",
    "this quantity is defined as    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the displacement vector of the @xmath84-th particle of the @xmath9-th normal mode .",
    "the participation ratio is a standard measure of localization of a mode@xcite .",
    "for example , for a translation of the system @xmath85 , while for a vibration of a single particle @xmath86 .    in dense systems the direction of the vibrations of a given particle , i.e. @xmath83 , is basically independent of the direction of the bonds that the particle forms with its neighbors . for a system that has long chains ,",
    "as the one studied here , this is no longer the case and hence it is of interest to be able to discriminate between longitudinal and transverse modes with respect to the bond direction ( i.e. along the local curvilinear direction of the chain ) . to this aim",
    "we quantify to what extent the displacement of the @xmath9-th normal mode is parallel to the local direction of the bond . by writing the direction joining bonded particles @xmath84 and @xmath12 as @xmath87 ,",

    "fig : eigen_pr_mode_bulks ] for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , together with the corresponding vdos for an extended frequency range .",
    "on increasing @xmath0 both functions become more structured , suggesting that different frequency regions are populated by modes with different characteristics .",
    "we start by discussing the @xmath71 case . the data for @xmath88 shows that modes for @xmath95 , i.e. modes that are not in the two peaks seen in @xmath1 , have @xmath96 , suggesting that such modes are mostly vibrations along the bond directions ( reminiscent of longitudinal modes ) .",
    "in contrast to this , modes with @xmath97 are characterized by a rather small value of @xmath88 , thus describing oscillations orthogonal to the chain direction , i.e. are similar to transverse modes .",
    "note that the transition of @xmath98 to values @xmath99 at @xmath100 is quite sharp , indicating a well defined cross - over from longitudinal modes at high frequencies to transverse modes at low @xmath2 .",
    "the participation ratio , which never exceeds the value @xmath101 , suggests that all modes are mostly localized .",
    "we recall that the value usually taken as indication of a collective oscillation , i.e. of propagating phonons@xcite , is @xmath102 .",
    "note that such propagating phonons are not even seen at low frequencies where one does expect acoustic modes .",
    "the absence of such excitations indicates that on the length scale of the simulation box the system is still very heterogeneous and as a consequence the modes can not propagate .",
    "however , it can be expected that for larger simulation boxes such propagating modes will indeed be present and the rise of @xmath94 at small @xmath2 can be taken as indication that one is approaching this acoustic regime . also at values of @xmath2",
    "in which @xmath1 shows the peak around @xmath103 we see that @xmath94 is significantly larger than zero .",
    "thus we conclude that also these modes show a significant delocalization .",
    "as we will show below , these modes correspond in fact to excitations in which a chain makes transverse oscillations , in agreement with the small values of @xmath88 in this @xmath104range .",
    "last but not least we see that @xmath94 is also relatively large if @xmath105 .",
    "this is ( probably ) related to the fact that at elevated frequencies the modes are a hybridization of ( relatively ) localized modes , thus should not really be considered as extended objects  @xcite .    in the case of @xmath70",
    ", @xmath88 never reaches very small values and the difference between the region of the peaks and the tail is less pronounced .",
    "this indicates that even modes with @xmath106 can not be described to be transverse ( with respect to the bond direction ) .",
    "this is consistent with the very short average chain length observed for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore we see that @xmath94 becomes relatively large as soon as @xmath107 , i.e. for these frequencies the modes are significantly more collective than for the case @xmath71 .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that for @xmath70 the structure of the system involves smaller length scales than the ones for large values of @xmath0 and hence acoustic like modes can propagate even at relatively high frequencies .",
    "from @xmath88 we also recognize that at large frequencies the modes appear to describe motion parallel to the bonds , i.e. @xmath88 is large .",
    "since the participation ratio is relatively small , this suggests that these longitudinal modes are localized .",
    "this feature is thus directly related to the structure of the system which , for small @xmath0 , shows short rings of bonded particles , as displayed in fig .",

    "interestingly enough , the main features of the linear chain are also retained in the bulk system , whose broad bands can qualitatively associated to the linear chain bands , providing a strong support for the interpretation of the disordered network modes discussed previously ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eigen_pr_mode_bulks ] ) .",
    "in this article we have studied in detail the vdos of a disordered system composed by poly - disperse chains of connected bi - functional particles , joined together via three - functional junctions .",
    "the relative concentration of bi- and three- functional particles makes it possible to control the average distance @xmath139 between junctions and explore the effect of the network mesh on the vdos .",
    "we have found a clear evolution of the vdos with @xmath140 , with a progressive structuring of @xmath1 . to provide a characterization of the modes in different frequency regions",
    ", we have calculated the participation ratio and the mode amplitude in the bond direction , which has allowed us to distinguish between localized and delocalized modes and transverse and longitudinal excitations .",
    "we have found support for the resulting classification via the analysis of specific structures of the networks , i.e. chains , stars of chains and rings , finding that most of the features of the bulk vdos can be associated with specific modes of these simpler structures .",
    "we have also found very helpful the comparison with the vdos of an infinite chain of particles interacting with the same potential .",
    "the comparison between the vdos calculated in the presence and in the absence of rotational - translational coupling helps clarifying the importance of such a coupling and the nature of the bands observed in the bulk disordered network .",
    "in particular , we observed that the coupling between translation and rotation significantly increases the vdos at low @xmath2 , which becomes populated by transverse modes , with frequencies which are strongly decreased ( as compared to the uncoupled system ) by the possibility of rotating the particles in coherence with the translational displacements .",
    "interestingly , this band is clearly retained also in the vdos of the bulk system .",
    "this study suggests that properties of the disordered systems can partially be traced back to properties of the corresponding crystal , with an adequate smearing introduced by the absence of long range periodicity and by the finite length of the chains .",
    "it also calls attention on the important role of the coupling between translation and rotation in the low frequency region of the spectrum , i.e. in the @xmath2 region where the boson peak is observed in glasses . _ for the present model _ it is this coupling that leads to a strong intensity of the vdos at low frequencies .",
    "however , this mechanism to generate low - frequency modes is certainly not the only one , since , i.e. , disorder in the coupling constants or in the masses will also give rise to soft modes as has been shown for other systems  @xcite .",
