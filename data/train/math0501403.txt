    "the problem of signal approximation outside the orthogonal basis setting is a non - linear problem , per se , in the following sense : let us consider that a signal @xmath0 in a separable hilbert space , equipped with an inner product @xmath1 and a norm @xmath2 , is to be approximated as the @xmath3-term superposition f^m= _",
    "n=1^m c_n^m _ n , [ at ] where @xmath4 are fixed elements of a non - orthogonal basis , which if well localized are often refereed to as _ atoms_. in order to construct the approximation @xmath5 of @xmath0 minimizing the distance @xmath6 the coefficients @xmath7 in should be computed as @xmath8 , where the dual sequence @xmath9 is biorthogonal to @xmath4 , and , in addition , the superscript is meant to indicate that @xmath10 .",
    "hence , in order to account for the inclusion ( or respective elimination ) of one term in , all the elements of the dual sequence need to be modified for the coefficients of the new approximation to minimize the distance to the signal @xmath0 .",
    "such modifications can be performed in an effective manner by means of adaptive biorthogonalization techniques @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of choosing the @xmath3 elements of a non - orthogonal basis best representing the signal is a highly nonlinear one @xcite . since the general problem has not feasible solution in polynomial time , in some practical situations it is addressed by algorithms which evolve by fixing atoms at each iteration step .",
    "these approaches are known as adaptive pursuit strategies @xcite .",
    "they operate by selecting atoms from a redundant set , called a _ dictionary_@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that , as far as complexity is concerned , there is not much to lose by applying the above mentioned practical selection strategies on a redundant dictionary , rather than on a non - orthogonal basis . nevertheless , as has been shown in the context of several applications ,",
    "there is potentially much to win in relation to sparseness of the signal representation .",
    "hence the motivation of this communication : _ we prove here that cardinal spline spaces on a compact interval are amenable to be spanned by dictionaries of cardinal b - spline functions of broader support than the corresponding basis functions . _    it goes without saying that splines have been used with success in wavelet theory and applications to signal processing @xcite .",
    "in particular , the construction of multiresolution based spline wavelets on a bounded interval is explained in great detail in @xcite .",
    "here we focus on b - spline functions and discuss the way of going from b - spline basis on the interval to b - spline dictionaries which are endowed with a very interesting property .",
    "cardinal spline spaces on a bounded interval are finite dimensional linear spaces .",
    "the dimension is actually given by the number @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the order of the splines being considered and @xmath13 the number of knots in the interval . by fixing the order of splines , the usual way of increasing",
    "the subspace dimension is to increase the number of knots , decreasing thereby the distance , @xmath14 , say , between two adjacent knots . let us recall that the basis functions for cardinal spline spaces ( b - spline basis ) have compact support which , except for the boundary functions , is of length @xmath15 .",
    "thus , by decreasing the distance @xmath14 between knots , the support of the functions is reduced . with the exception of the boundary functions @xcite a b - spline basis for",
    "the subspace arises by successive translations of a prototype function .",
    "the translation parameter is the distance between knots .",
    "it is clear then that if the translation operation is carried out with a translation parameter @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 is an integer , some redundancy will be introduced .",
    "however , the main result of this contribution is to prove that , by such a procedure , one can generate the span for the cardinal spline space associated with the distance @xmath16 between knots .",
    "we believe this to be a remarkable feature of splines , which is potentially useful in relation to signal representation .",
    "such a possibility will be illustrated using matching pursuit strategies for representing a signal by selecting atoms from our cardinal spline dictionaries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : splines ] provides some definitions and background on splines relevant for our purpose .",
    "section  [ sec : dictionary ] gives the proof of the main theorem establishing the above mentioned property of the proposed dictionaries .",
    "the potential suitability of such dictionaries for recursive signal approximation is illustrated in section  [ sec : application ] .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "such a partition is thereby uniquely determined by the interval @xmath18 $ ] and the distance , @xmath14 say , between two adjacent points .",
    "it is assumed that the interval @xmath18 $ ] contains at least one complete b - spline function , i.e. , @xmath62 .",

    "we construct an equidistant partition of @xmath18 , ( c , d ) , ( c , d],$ ] and @xmath63 with distance @xmath14 between adjacent points ( such that @xmath64integer ) as follows : @xmath65&= \\{c , c+b,\\dots , d - b , d\\ } , \\qquad & &   \\p_b(c , d)=\\{c+b,\\dots , d - b\\ } , \\nonumber\\\\ \\p_b(c , d]&=\\{c+b,\\dots , d - b , d\\ } , \\qquad & & \\p_b[c , d)=\\{c , c+b,\\dots , d - b\\ } \\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as already mentioned , the selection of a particular extended partition @xmath40 yields a particular b - spline basis for @xmath28 .",
    "two possible choices for the first and last @xmath12 points determining the extended partition are the following :    * the points @xmath66 and @xmath67 are determined in order for the whole sequence @xmath38 to be endowed with the equidistant property , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "such a sequence is called an _ equally spaced extended partition _ ( esep ) . * the points lying outside @xmath18 $ ]",

    "this is called an _ extended partition with @xmath12-tuple knots on the border _ ( epkb ) .",
    "for the sake of a simpler notation we prefer to build dictionaries by considering the extended partition esep , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "the reason is that , since the whole partition is then equidistant , we can construct the spanning functions by translation of one prototype b - spline of support of length @xmath15 into the points @xmath71 and the restriction of the functions to the interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "this process is equivalent to constructing the boundary functions by truncation ( see figure  [ f1 ] ) , which allows us to use a simple notation to label the dictionary functions . shifting indices , for later convenience , we indicate the basis for @xmath28 associated to the esep @xmath40 as @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",

    "it is clear that the dimension can be increased by decreasing the distance between knots .",
    "the main contribution of the present effort is to propose an alternative way of increasing dimension , namely : maintaining the same distance between knots and including functions arising by simple translations of the basis function for @xmath28 .",

    "we have thereby proved that @xmath133 .",
    "the proof concerning functions @xmath134 parallels the proof given above , but the following considerations are in order : to obtain the corresponding equation for @xmath135 we use and the fact that @xmath136 for @xmath137 .",
    "the required decomposition arises by evaluating such an equation at values of @xmath138 in decreasing order ranging from @xmath137 to @xmath139 .",

    "the upper bound is a consequence of schwartz inequality and the non - zero lower bound is ensured by the fact that for @xmath141 it is true that @xmath144 at least for one @xmath138 in @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "it is appropriate to point out that , although the proof of theorem  [ maintheorem ] was given for dictionaries constructed within an esep setting , the result can be extended to more general extended partition settings .",
    "the corresponding proof is equivalent to the one given here , but it involves a less handy notation .",

    "the graphs at the bottom have the same description as the middle graphs , but correspond to the epkb extended partition .    .",

    "we present here two examples to illustrate the relevance of the proposed dictionaries to a typical problem of signal representation : the problem of achieving a sparse atomic decomposition approximating a given signal .    as a first example we consider",
    "the randomly generated blocky signal on the interval @xmath147 $ ] depicted in the left graph of figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "such a signal has an acceptable approximation in the subspace @xmath148 , with distance between knots @xmath149 , spanned by a b - spline basis of order one .",
    "the graph indicating the signal approximation coincides with the one of figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "for such an approximation we need to use almost all the basis functions ( 956 out of 1024 ) .",
    "this is of course an expected result , since the support of the basis functions for @xmath150 is considerably small ( @xmath151 ) in comparison to the length of the blocks composing the signal .",
    "it is then convenient to construct the identical approximation using dictionary functions of much larger support ( @xmath152 ) spanning the same space @xmath150 . in this case",
    "the approximation is obtained by means of only @xmath153 functions , chosen through a forward and backward optimized orthogonal matching pursuit strategy @xcite , from a dictionary of @xmath154 atoms . for further comparison",
    "we have used the haar wavelet representation for the same space , which contains wavelets of varied support and scaling functions of the same support as the dictionary functions . since haar wavelets",
    "are orthonormal , to obtain the desired signal approximation we need just to retain @xmath155 basis functions corresponding to the 50 coefficients of largest absolute value .",
    "the second example involves the piece of modulated chirp signal plotted in right graph of figure  [ f2 ] .",
    "this signal has an acceptable representation in the subspace @xmath156 , with @xmath157 , spanned by the b - splines basis of order four . since in this case",
    "the basis is non - orthogonal , in order to approximate the signal by a subset of basis functions we applied the same pursuit strategy as in the previous example .",
    "an approximation coinciding with the graph of figure  [ f2 ] is obtained with @xmath158 basis functions . using a dictionary of functions having four times larger support ( i.e. , distance @xmath159 between knots ) , and the same matching pursuit strategy for selecting functions",
    ", we need @xmath160 dictionary functions . in this case",
    ", the selection from the wavelet representation of the subspace needs to be carried out also through the matching pursuit approach .",
    "the required number of wavelet functions is @xmath161 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in both examples we have achieved representations which in terms of sparseness are comparable ( superior in the first case ) to wavelet basis representation .",
    "this is a surprising result , since wavelet basis are composed by functions of different support and our dictionaries by functions of fixed support .",
    "these outcomes are certainly worth to be investigated further .    matlab codes for generating the proposed dictionaries and implementing pursuit strategies are available at @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature of b - spline functions ha s been discussed .",
    "we have shown that a dictionary for a cardinal spline space on a compact interval can be constructed by translating a prototype b - spline function into the knots of the corresponding space .",
    "this property allows to span a cardinal spline space by using b - spline functions of larger support than the one corresponding to the basis functions for the same space .    as an example of application of the proposed dictionaries , two signals of different nature",
    "have been represented by selecting atoms from dictionaries of b - splines .",
    "the results illustrate the possible relevance of b - spline dictionaries to problems requiring sparse representation .",
    "finally , we would like to point out some lines of follow up work that we believe to be interesting : the possibility of spanning a fixed space by b - spline dictionaries , each of which consists of functions of different support , arises the question as to how to choose in a effective manner the dictionary of b - splines of ` optimal support ' for representing a given signal .",
