    "the evolution of massive stars will depend upon the initial metallicity of the gas out of which they form , and thus we can expect differences in the relative numbers of various stages of massive stars among nearby galaxies .",
    "( for a comprehensive review of the subject , see maeder & conti 1994 . )",
    "the primary effect that metallicity has is due to its influence on radiatively - driven stellar winds and the resulting mass loss .",
    "typical mass - loss rates for galactic o - type stars are 0.520@xmath4 year@xmath1 ( puls et al .",
    "1996 ) , with the more massive stars losing a greater fraction of their mass during their main - sequence lifetimes depends upon the luminosity @xmath5 as @xmath6 ( pauldrach , puls & kudritzki 1986 ; de jager , nieuwenhuijzen , & van der hucht 1988 ; kudritzki & puls 2000 ) , and since luminosity depends upon mass @xmath7 as @xmath8 for high mass stars ( massey 1998a , using the schaller et al .",
    "1992 @xmath9 evolutionary tracks ) , we expect that the mass - loss rates will depend upon the mass roughly as @xmath10 .",
    "the main - sequence lifetime @xmath11 is a relatively weak function of the mass for high - mass stars , and inspection of the schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) @xmath9 tracks suggests that @xmath12 .",
    "so we expect that the total mass loss during the main - sequence phase ( @xmath13 ) will go roughly as @xmath14 .",
    "thus the fractional mass lost , @xmath15 , will go as @xmath16 . and",
    ", this is just on the main - sequence ! stars with luminosities above @xmath17 will suffer episodes of enhanced mass loss as their luminosities exceed the eddington limit once line opacities are taken into account ; this stage is likely identified with the luminous blue variable phase ( stars such as @xmath18 car and s dor ) , and accounts for the humphreys & davidson ( 1979 ) upper luminosity limit in the h - r diagram ( lamers 1997 ) . ] . a very high mass star ( 100@xmath19 )",
    "might then lose 50% of its mass during its evolution , which has a profound effect on its path in the h - r diagram , as first shown by de loore , de grve , & lamers ( 1977 ) , de loore , de grve , & vanbeveren ( 1978 ) , chiosi , nasi , & sreenivasan ( 1978 ) , chiosi , nasi , & bertelli ( 1979 ) , brunish & truran ( 1982 ) , and subsequent investigations .",
    "mass - loss rates will scale with metallicity @xmath20 to some power , with the exponent variously estimated from 1.0 to 0.5 ( abbott 1982 ; lamers & cassinelli 1996 ; kudritzki et al .",
    "1989 ; puls , springmann , & lennon 2000 ; kudritzki & puls 2000 ; vink , de koter , & lamers 2001 ; kudritzki 2002 ) . beyond the main - sequence mass - loss rates are highly uncertain ;",
    "for instance , mass loss during the lbv phase is highly episodic and large , with little agreement in what drives the outbursts ( humphreys & davidson 1994 , maeder & conti 1994 ) .",
    "large uncertainties also exist in the mass - loss rates during the red supergiant ( rsg ) phase , making the subsequent tracks even less certain ( salasnich , bressan , & chiosi 1999 ) .",
    "it is commonly assumed that mass - loss rates for wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) are independent of initial metallicity , since their atmospheres have been so enriched by the products of their own nuclear burning ( e.g. , schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) , but crowther et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have recently argued that iron is an important element in driving the wr winds , and hence that there will be some @xmath20 dependence in their mass - loss rates .",
    "in addition to the effects of mass loss , stellar evolutionary tracks are also sensitive to the treatments of convection and mixing ( maeder & meynet 1987 ) , and there is considerable disagreement among the pundits as to the proper way to include these in the models ( maeder & conti 1994 ) .",
    "recent emphasis has been on the role that rotation plays in mixing in massive stars ( maeder & meynet 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "convection and mixing also show some dependence on the metallicity ( see , for example , meynet & maeder 2002 ) , and the uncertainties in their treatment underscores the fact that the physics of massive star evolution is not perfectly well understood at present .    in order to advance our understanding of massive star evolution ,",
    "it is necessary to have a solid observational database with which the predictions of stellar evolutionary theory may be compared and refined .",
    "a well - known example is the relative number of blue and red supergiants , which van den bergh ( 1973 ) first suggested varied among nearby galaxies due to the effects of metallicity on massive star evolution .",
    "particularly sensitive tests include the relative numbers of different types of evolved massive stars , such as the relative number of different types of wolf - rayet stars ( wc - type and wn - type ) , or the relative number of rsgs and wrs .",
    "maeder , lequeux , & azzopardi ( 1980 ) proposed that the latter number ratio would be particularly sensitive to metallicity effects .",
    "however , there are many observational difficulties in determining such statistics reliably . for wolf - rayet stars , there are selection effects against finding wn - type wrs ( armandroff & massey 1985 , massey & johnson 1998 ) . for red supergiants ,",
    "the problem is that when we look towards a galaxy such as m  31 or the magellanic clouds we see not only the _ bona fide _",
    "extragalactic rsgs but also foreground galactic red dwarfs in the same color and apparent magnitude range .",
    "massey ( 1998b ) found that _",
    "photometry helped separate rsgs from foreground dwarfs , but was not by itself sufficient .",
    "spectroscopy allows an accurate assessment , however .",
    "although the luminosity indicators for late - type stars are rather subtle , an effective technique is to use the near - ir ca  ii triplet lines to determine a star s radial velocity . for many local group galaxies",
    "this provides a very clean separation of foreground red dwarfs from extragalactic red supergiants .",
    "here we extend this technique to our nearest galactic neighbors , the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "massey ( 2002a ) estimated the degree of foreground contamination would be about 10% in the appropriate magnitude / color range , far lower than the @xmath21 50% found in m31 , m33 , and ngc  6822 by massey ( 1998b ) , both because the clouds are nearer and at higher galactic latitude .",
    "however , an accurate census of the rsg population in the magellanic clouds is of particular interest , as these galaxies are sufficiently close that a great deal is already known about their blue supergiant population , for which much spectroscopy has been carried out ( massey et al .",
    "1995 , massey 2002a ) .",
    "throughout this paper we will adopt the distance and average reddenings listed by van den bergh ( 2000 ) , namely @xmath22 and @xmath23=0.13 for the lmc , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the smc .",
    "our sample of red supergiant candidates comes from a recent _ ubvr _ ccd survey covering most of the clouds ( massey 2002a ) .",
    "the sample was chosen to include potential k- and m - type supergiants , based upon the criteria of @xmath26 and a @xmath27 cutoff such that @xmath28 given the observed @xmath29 color and assumed average reddening ( i.e. , tables 9a and 9b of massey 2002a ) .",
    "a few additional red stars which did not quite meet these requirements were also included .",
    "our spectroscopy used the hydra fiber positioner ( barden & ingerson 1998 ) on the blanco 4-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory during the nights of ( ut ) 4 - 6 oct 2001 . on the first two nights , grating 380 ( 1200 lines mm@xmath1 , blaze 8000 ) was used in first order with an rg-610 blocking filter to obtain data at the ca  ii triplet lines ( @xmath30 8498 , 8542 , 8662 ) . a site 2k",
    "@xmath31 4k ccd was used unbinned , behind a 400  mm focal length camera on a bench spectrograph , to obtain a dispersion of 0.27  pixel@xmath1 , with a wavelength coverage extending from 8000  to 9000 .",
    "a 200 @xmath32 m slit plate was inserted at the output of the fiber bundle to yield a resolution of 1.2  ( 4.5 pixels ) . on the third night",
    "( and for a small portion of an engineering night that immediately preceded the run ) , we used grating kpgl1 ( 632 lines mm@xmath1 , blaze 4200 ) in first order with no blocking filter to obtain spectra in the blue in order to determine spectral subtypes .",
    "the ccd was binned in the spectral direction by a factor of 2 , to obtain a dispersion of 1.2  pixel@xmath1 , with a wavelength coverage extending from 3900  to 6100 .",
    "no slit plate was used , and the resolution ( set by the size of the fibers ) was approximately 4  ( 3.5 binned pixels ) .",
    "the hydra fiber positioner consists of 138 fibers ( 300@xmath32 m , or 2.0-arcsec in diameter ) that can be accurately positioned in a 40-arcminute diameter field of view at the rc focus of the blanco 4-m .",
    "an atmospheric dispersion corrector is mounted above the focal plane .",
    "the closest fiber - to - fiber spacing is approximately 25 arcsecs .",
    "this proved a good match to the density of rsg candidates in most of our fields .",
    "our observing procedure was to configure hydra at the zenith , and then obtain a short exposure of a quartz - lamp projector flat that could be used for flat fielding and for removing the relative transmissions of each fiber .",
    "( the projector flats were taken for each new configuration to guard against slight flexure changes in the ccd dewar as the liquid nitrogen cryogen evaporates . )",
    "we would then offset to the field position and align the telescope using 3 to 7  field orientation probes \" ( bundles of 6 closely spaced fibers ) that had been placed at the coordinates of bright stars within the field ; these would also be used for guiding .",
    "our program observations then consisted of 3 exposures of 5 mins in length .",
    "these would be followed by a short exposure of a comparison lamp of he , ne , and ar for wavelength calibration .",
    "we would then return to zenith and reconfigure for the next field .",
    "the observations were all carried out by k.a.g.o . , while p.m. kibitzed from his office in flagstaff using the internet to help examine the data in real time .    conditions were relatively good throughout the run , with two hours lost at the beginning of the first night due to fog and the last hour of the third night lost to clouds .",
    "the seeing was poor on the first night ( 3 arcsecs ) but was significantly better ( 1 - 2 arcsecs ) on subsequent nights .",
    "the variation in throughput caused by the changes in seeing have no effect on our results , as we are concerned only with the relative strengths and positions of absorption features , and not on absolute spectrophotometry .",
    "all told , we were able to obtain radial velocity information for 6 fields in the smc and 10 fields in the lmc , with a repeat of one of the smc fields on the second night as a consistency check .",
    "the same 6 smc fields were observed for the purposes of spectral classification , along with 7 of the lmc fields .    on our two radial velocity nights we obtained a total of 10 observations ( 5 per night ) of 4 radial velocity standards , spread throughout the night .",
    "several different fibers were used for the standards , and the stars were chosen from the list of standard radial velocity ( rv ) stars in the 2001 _ astronomical almanac _ , selected for being of late - type and accessible during our run .",
    "the stars included hd  12029 ( k2  iii ,",

    "as we will describe in section  [ sec : rvs ] there was no systematic difference from one night to the next , and our precision was sufficiently high to detect small inconsistencies in the relative velocities of the standards .    for the purposes of spectral classification ,",

    ", we reduced the spectra using the iraf  dohydra \" script .",
    "the quartz - lamp projector flats were used to define the identification , location , and shape of the fiber profiles on the chip .",
    "this information was used to  optimally extract \" the program objects and comparison exposures ; flat - fielding and removing the fiber - to - fiber variations was done using the extracted projector flat exposures as well .",
    "we found that the illumination of the outlying fibers with the projector flat did not match the sky illumination very well . in sky - limited applications",
    "this would compromise the sky subtraction unless corrected for by observations of blank sky , say , but since our stars were quite bright compared to the sky , this made little difference in our final data .",
    "the extracted spectra were then wavelength calibrated using the extracted comparison - line spectra .",
    "finally , the three one - dimension spectra of each object were averaged using bad - pixel rejection .",
    "the standard star data were treated identically , except that a single exposure was involved and so no averaging was done .",
    "the spectra in the red ( that would be used for radial velocity measurements ) were then normalized by a low - order cubic spline , and then shifted by unity to make the average continuum level zero .",
    "radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating each magellanic cloud spectrum against each of the radial velocity standard star observations . since we could find no systematic effect in cross - correlating the spectra of the radial velocity standards from one night to the next , we simply treated all of our data the same , regardless of which night they were obtained on .",
    "we used the iraf routine `` fxcor '' , and limited the cross correlation to the region 8450-8700  in order to isolate the ca  ii triplet ( @xmath30 8498 , 8542 , 8662 ) .",
    "the cross - correlation peaks were fit by a parabola , resulting in an internal precision of 0.5 - 0.7 km  s@xmath1 for each measurement . the measurement based on each of the ten standard star observations",
    "were then averaged ; the agreement between these were excellent , and the resulting means had a standard deviation of the mean of 0.2 - 0.3 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we believe this is an honest estimate of our actual accuracy , as quite a few stars were observed twice ( or even three times ) owing either to their locations in overlapping fields , or due to two observation of the same fields on different nights .",
    "the typical agreement for these stars was 0.25 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "our spectra are so well exposed , and the ca  ii triplet lines so strong , that we could easily detect small systematic differences in the cross - correlations produced by different standard stars . for instance , each of the two observations of the standard star hd  213947 ( obtained on separate nights ) produced cross - correlations that were @xmath34 km  s@xmath1 high compared to that obtained from the ensemble , while the standard star hd  12029 produced cross - correlations that were @xmath34 km  s@xmath1 low compared to that obtained from the ensemble ) and hd  223311 ( @xmath35 km  s@xmath1 ) as correct , then the true radial velocity of hd  213947 is 15.0 km  s@xmath1 rather than the 16.7 km  s@xmath1 adopted by the iau , while that of hd  12029 is 39.6 km  s@xmath1 rather than the 38.6 km  s@xmath1 adopted by the iau . ] .",
    "altogether , we obtained radial velocities for 118 stars in the smc .",
    "three were measured three times , and 42 were measured twice . for the lmc , we obtained radial velocities for 167 stars .",
    "of these , seven were measured three times , and 35 were measured twice .    in tables",
    "[ tab : smc ] and [ tab : lmc ] we give the average radial velocities of the stars in our sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : rvhists ] shows the histograms of these velocities , with the center - of - mass systemic velocities of the clouds indicated .    for both the smc and lmc",
    "there is excellent agreement in the peaks of the histograms and the cataloged systemic velocities of each cloud .",
    "the  tail \" of velocities extending to lower radial velocities is readily identified as the foreground red dwarfs which we had hoped to distinguish from the members of the clouds . for the lmc diagram",
    "the separation is quite clean .",
    "the lower systemic velocities of the smc results in there being a little uncertainty for three stars with intermediate velocities .",
    "we have assigned membership in the tables based upon whether or not the radial velocity is greater than 100 km  s@xmath1 .    based upon the radial velocities , we conclude that 11.0% of the stars in the smc sample proved to be foreground stars , while only 5.3% of the stars in the lmc sample were foreground stars .      we include our spectral types in tables  [ tab : smc ] and [ tab : lmc ] .",
    "not all stars were observed in the blue , and hence there are stars for which there are no spectral types .",
    "these were determined by comparison of our spectra of spectral standards to the program objects .",
    "at our dispersion and signal - to - noise , the presence of the tio @xmath36 suggests that the star is k5 or later , and the classification was based upon the strength of the tio bands at @xmath30 4761 , 4954 , 5167 , 5448 , and 5847 .",
    "if there was no tio present , then the relative strength of ca  i @xmath37 and the g band were used to determined the spectral subtype in the range k0-k5 .",
    "strong h@xmath38 suggested an earlier type ( g - type ) , which proved to be the case for a few of the foreground dwarfs .",
    "the luminosity criteria are quite subtle , and we relied upon our radial velocities to guide us in assigning  v \" for foreground dwarfs , or ",
    "i \" for supergiants .",
    "the presence of lmc giants in our sample is precluded by our @xmath27 magnitude selection criterion .    the comparison with the published spectral types for some stars in common with elias , frogel , & humphreys ( 1985 ) [ smc ] , and humphreys ( 1979 ) [ lmc ] shows generally excellent agreement .",
    "the average difference is less than half a spectral type for the 76 stars in common . in only three cases",
    "the difference is 3 spectral subclasses or more ; i.e. , smc-026778 , which we call k2  i but elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) call m0  i ; smc-054708 , which we call k0  i but elias et al .  ( 1985 ) call m0 iab ; and lmc-178066 , which we call k7  i but humphreys ( 1979 ) call m2  ia .",
    "given the size of the discrepancy , we speculate that these may be spectrum variables .",
    "( in the case of the lmc star , the identification is not certain , as only approximate coordinates had ever been published for the case stars that were subsequently observed by humphreys 1979 . )",
    "what do these spectral types mean in terms of physical parameters ?",
    "we have classified the stars in the traditional way , relying upon the strengths of the tio bands to determine the spectral type , with stronger bands leading to a later type . however , the metallicity ( as judged from the oxygen abundances of h  ii regions ) of the lmc is about a factor of 2 lower than in the solar neighborhood , while the metallicity of the smc is about a factor of 4 times lower ( russell & dopita 1990 ) .",
    "thus rsgs of the _ same _ effective temperatures in the milky way , lmc , and smc would be classified as progressively earlier in these three galaxies as lower metal abundance weakens the tio band strength used to classify these stars .",
    "elias et al .  ( 1985 ) see such an effect in their comparison of the average ( median ) spectral types of rsgs in smc ( m0",
    "i ) , the lmc ( m1  i ) , and the milky way ( m2 - 3  i ) , but attribute the change primarily to the effect that metallicity has on the location of the ( giant branch ) hayashi track , only secondarily to the effects on the spectral appearance of stars of a given effective temperature",
    ". however , modern evolutionary models do not show a hayashi track for red _ super_giants , and so it is worth re - examining this issue .",
    "we show our own histograms for the lmc and smc supergiants in our sample , and compare these to the distribution of spectral types for the milky way taken from table  20 in elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) . the medians we find are k5 - 7  i for the smc , m1  i for the lmc , and m2  i for the milky way .",
    "the median spectral type in the smc is somewhat earlier than that found by elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , and probably results either from our larger sample size , or our better completeness for early k - type supergiants .",
    "we find , as do elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , that the distribution of spectral types is more narrow in the smc than in the lmc or milky way , although we still find rsgs as late as m3  i in the smc  just not in large numbers .",
    "first , let us ask if it is reasonable that this progression in average spectral types is due solely to the effect that metallicity has on the relationship between spectral type and effective temperature . in table  [ tab : teff ] we compare various effective temperature scales for galactic rsgs .",
    "we include here the effective temperature scale adopted by humphreys & mcelroy ( 1984 ) , based upon a number of sources , and the lee ( 1970 ) calibration of effective temperature with spectral types for m - type supergiants , based primarily on a very limited amount of  fundamental \" data ( i.e. , using stars with known radii ) .",
    "this work has been extended considerably in recent years by dyck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and dyck , van belle , & thompson ( 1998 ) , who obtained new interferometric observations at 2.2@xmath32 m , and combined these with similar data from the literature .",
    "they provide a scale for red _ giants _ , but consider the supergiant data to be too sparse for a calibration .",
    "their supergiant data clearly lies several hundred degrees cooler than the giant sequence ( i.e. , fig .  3 in dyck et al .",
    "houdashelt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) recently compared the temperatures expected from the new marcs models to the dyck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) values and found very good agreement .",
    "we have adjusted the dyck et al .",
    "( 1996 ) scale for red _ giants _ by @xmath39k ( i.e. , to cooler temperatures ) to produce reasonable estimates for _ supergiants _ , consistent with the temperature differences illustrated in their fig .  3 .",
    "( see also discussion following bessell 1998 . ) comparing all of these values have led to a somewhat arbitrary effective temperature scale which we adopt here , noting that the present uncertainties prevent a more definitive answer at this time .",
    "what sort of change is expected on the basis of metallicity ? improved stellar atmospheres applicable to rsgs are under construction ( gustafsson et al .",
    "2003 , plez 2003 ) but until these are generally available we turn to the  atlas 9 \" model atmospheres of kurucz ( 1992 ) to help answer this question .",
    "although oestreicher & schmidt - kaler ( 1998 ) find that the atlas 9 models significantly underestimate the amount of molecular absorption for _ some _ lines in late - type stars , we show that there is pretty good agreement in fig .",
    "[ fig : kurucz ] , where we compare the coolest of kurucz ( 1992 ) models to the spectra of three of our spectral standards .",
    "the kurucz ( 1992 ) models correspond to solar metallicity and @xmath40 , which is appropriate for a massive supergiant",
    ". will vary from about @xmath41 ( 20@xmath19 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) to @xmath44 ( 40@xmath19 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus the @xmath40 kurucz ( 1992 ) models are the most appropriate ones available for rsgs .",
    "fortunately , the strengths of the tio bands in general are not sensitive to the exact choice of @xmath47 ; see schiavon & barbuy ( 1999 ) .",
    "] we see that the 3500@xmath2k model shows tio lines that are roughly comparable with what is seen in m0-m2  i supergiants , consistent with the effective temperature scale we adopted in table  [ tab : teff ] .",
    "similarly , the tio bands in the 4000@xmath2k model are similar to that of the k2.5  i standard , also in accord with the effective temperature scale adopted above .",
    "the spectra are plotted in log units in order to facilitate comparison of band depths without the subjective task of normalization .",
    "the continuum fluxes of the stellar spectra have been adjusted by comparison with stars of similar spectral types from the jacoby , hunter , & christian ( 1984 ) atlas , and so the relative fluxes are only approximate ; what matters is the line depths .",
    "we next investigate the effect the kurucz ( 1992 ) models predict for a change in metallicity from galactic to that of the smc , where we have observed the spectral types change from m2  i to k5  i. the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : kurucz ] shows the kurucz ( 1992 ) model for a 3500@xmath2k supergiant computed with an abundance @xmath48 , while the blue curve corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "the metallicity of smc should be intermediate between these two values .",
    "we see that metallicity alone has changed the line depths to be intermediate between the 3750@xmath2k and 4000@xmath2 models .",
    "thus the change in metallicity from the milky way to that of the smc is likely to weaken the appearance of the tio spectral lines by an amount corresponding to @xmath50k to @xmath51k .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath52k temperature difference between ( galactic ) m2  i and k5 - 7  i stars .",
    "thus the effective temperature scale at lower metallicity will be cooler ; i.e. , an smc m0  i star would be 300 cooler than a galactic m0  i star .",
    "a more quantitative comparison requires higher resolution synthetic spectra and a finer temperature and metallicity grid , and these will soon be available for such tests from the marcs group ( gustafsson et al .",
    "2003 , and plez 2003 ) that expected for a supergiant , so the application to the stars we discuss here is not straight - forward .",
    "we will note that his spectra apply a considerably warmer temperature scale ( and considerably more compressed ) than what we adopt here . at first blush",
    ", the warmer scale appears to be in disagreement with the fundamental data of lee ( 1970 ) and dyck et al .",
    "the models do not show much of an effect with metallicity , but a more careful comparison done with absolute spectrophotometry , with more appropriate surface gravities , is needed . ] . in the meanwhile , we will adopt an effective temperature scale for the magellanic cloud rsgs that is 300@xmath2 cooler for the smc , and 100@xmath2 cooler for the lmc , compared with the milky way , consistent with the average change in spectral type we observe .",
    "we can provide an additional check on this by examining the intrinsic colors .",
    "it is generally recognized that @xmath53 is a good effective temperature indicator for cool stars , while @xmath54 is sensitive both to effective temperature and to surface gravity ( e.g. , lee 1970 , massey 1998b , oestreicher & schmidt - kaler 1999 ) . in table",
    "[ tab : kurucz ] we give the expected @xmath54 and @xmath53 colors as a function of effective temperature and metallicity computed from the kurucz ( 1992 ) atlas 9 models , where we have adopted the description of the _ b _ and _ v _ band - passes from buser & kurucz ( 1992 ) , and that of the kron - cousins _ r _ bandband from bessel ( 1983 ) .",
    "we include in table  [ tab : kurucz ] the approximate corresponding spectral types for galactic stars , using table  [ tab : teff ] .",

    "there is no change from the milky way to the lmc , but that we expect that @xmath53 will be significant larger ( 0.07  mag ) in the smc .",
    "how do these colors compare to the observed photometry ? in table  [ tab : colors ] we give the average @xmath54 and @xmath53 colors for our spectral types , where we have corrected the observed colors in tables  [ tab : smc ] and [ tab : lmc ] by the average reddenings as indicated in the footnote to the table .",
    "we have used the arithmetic means at each spectral type , after rejecting the highest and lowest values in producing these averages .",
    "we do not list colors for any spectral types with 3 or fewer representatives .    for the lmc",
    "there is relatively good agreement : we expect an lmc m0  i star to have @xmath55k ( i.e. , 100@xmath2 cooler than the value listed in table  [ tab : teff ] ) and the kurucz ( 1992 ) model atmospheres predict a @xmath53 color of 0.92 .",
    "we observe @xmath56 ( table  [ tab : colors ] ) .",
    "however , for the smc the agreement is poor between the kurucz ( 1992 ) @xmath53 colors and those observed .",
    "if we correct the galactic scale by @xmath57k as argued above , a 3500@xmath2k smc star should have a spectral type of k5  i. the models then predict a @xmath53 color of 0.99 .",
    "but , what we actually observe is a @xmath53 color of 0.84 .",
    "if we had made _ no _ correction to the galactic effective temperature scale then the broad - band colors would be in pretty good agreement .",
    "have we fooled ourselves in making this correction ? possibly",
    ". however , bessell et al .  (",
    "1989 ) has published a few models applicable to cool supergiants .",
    "we give their @xmath53 colors in table  [ tab : bessell ] .",
    "their smc - like metallicity ( @xmath58 ) supergiant model predict a @xmath53 color of 0.84 at 3500@xmath2k ( @xmath59g=-0.26 ) , in excellent agreement with the observed colors if we apply our temperature correction . similarly , their @xmath60k model predicts a @xmath53 color of 0.92 . applying our correction",
    ", we would expect this temperature would correspond to an smc star of spectral type k7-m0  i , and indeed we find an observed color of 0.88 - 0.94 , in good agreement .",
    "lmc - like metallicity models were not computed by bessell et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , limiting the degree we can make this comparison , but we note that their galactic @xmath53 colors are significantly bluer than the kurucz ( 1992 ) models would predict ( e.g. , 0.74 vs. 0.92 at @xmath60k ) . a finer grid of higher - resolution synthetic spectra appropriate to cool supergiants is needed before a metallicity - dependent effective temperature scale can be reliably derived .",
    "let us next compare the distribution of stars in the h - r diagram to that predicted by stellar evolutionary models .",
    "we use the  corrected \" temperatures for the spectral types , as defined above . for stars without spectral types , we can use the @xmath53 to determine an effective temperature .",
    "comparison of our measured colors for the stars with spectral types produces two linear relations : @xmath61 @xmath62    the conversion from the adopted effective temperatures to bolometric corrections is made by using the relation of slesnick , hillenbrand , & massey ( 2002 ) , which is primarily a fit to the bolometric corrections as a function of effective temperatures tabulated by humphreys & mcelroy ( 1984 ) .",
    "we have included the adopted @xmath63 and @xmath64 in tables  [ tab : smc ] and [ tab : lmc ] .    as the massey ( 2002a )",
    "photometric survey was limited in area and could conceivably suffer from saturation for the most luminous supergiants , we should also consider other stars that have been spectroscopically confirmed as magellanic cloud rsgs .",
    "we list these in tables  [ tab : smcother ] and [ tab : lmcother ] . in the case of the smc we have excellent cross - reference to the spectral types of elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) thanks to the good coordinates provided by sanduleak ( 1989 ) . however , cross - referencing to the spectral types of humphreys ( 1979 ) was more of a challenge as only approximate coordinates were provided in the case objective prism survey ( sanduleak & philip 1977 ) from which humphreys ( 1979 ) drew her sample for spectroscopy . thus massey ( 2002a ) gives all cross - identifications for the lmc stars as tentative , and there were a number of stars for which several possible matches were a possibility .",
    "thus there may be other previously observed lmc rsgs that we have incorrectly adopted as identical to our stars in table  [ tab : lmc ] .",
    "we show the h - r diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig : smchrds ] and [ fig : lmchrds ] , where we include the evolutionary tracks both of the geneva and padova groups ( schaerer et al .",
    "1993 ; meynet et al .  1994 ; fagotto et al .",
    "we see here a very interesting effect , namely that _ none _ of these evolutionary tracks produce rsgs that are as cool and as luminous as observed in the magellanic clouds .",
    "although the agreement is good at 12@xmath19 masses , at higher masses the tracks simply do not go far enough to the right ( cool temperatures ) to produce the rsgs that we observe .",
    "it would appear that the rsg sequence extends up to perhaps 40@xmath19 , but that those tracks simply do not go sufficiently far to the right in the diagram .",
    "massey ( 2002b , 2003 ) finds that the identical problem exists for galactic rsgs even when adopting the effective temperature scale and luminosities of humphreys ( 1978 ) .",
    "this discrepancy has also been suggested by the poor match of synthetic  starburst \" spectra to observations of the integrated light of various stellar populations ( e.g. , mayya 1997 , oliva & origlia 1998 , origlia et al .",
    "it is quite apparent even if one looks only at the broad - band colors derived by lejeune & schaerer ( 2001 ) .",
    "for instance , if one considers the 40@xmath19 evolutionary track computed with @xmath65 and a normal mass - loss rate by charbonnel et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which is shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , lejeune & schaerer 2001 ) compute @xmath66 and @xmath67 at the coolest extension of the track .",
    "these colors correspond to a mid - f type supergiant .    what can account for the problem with the evolutionary tracks ?",
    "one possibility is the difference that the treatment of convection can make in the evolutionary tracks .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "9 of maeder & meynet ( 1987 ) , where they compare the older bhm - vitense ( 1981 ) mixing length ( 1.5 times the local pressure scale height ) with a more accurate treatment that includes the effects of turbulent pressure and acoustic flux and has the mixing length proportional to the density scale height .",
    "although the physics is better , the result is that the evolutionary tracks no longer produce rsgs that are as luminous and cool as earlier models had .",
    "however , the padova models reply upon the older bhm - vitense ( 1981 ) prescription , albeit it with a mixing length of 1.63 times the pressure scale height , and these too suffer from the same problem , as shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : smchrds ] and [ fig : lmchrds ] .",
    "maeder & meynet ( 1987 ) were certainly aware of the mis - match between theory and observation , and expressed the hope that ",
    "complete stellar models \" ( i.e. , ones which included the extended atmospheres caused by stellar winds ) would some day alleviate the problem .",
    "such winds would make the star larger than the ( purely ) interior models would suggest , lowering the effective temperature . in the meanwhile , this discrepancy has been generally ignored by the users of these models .    what if we had ignored the effective temperature corrections ? in fig .",
    "[ fig : oldhrds ] we compare the h - r diagrams for the smc and lmc adopting the galactic spectral type to effective temperature calibration from table  [ tab : teff ] , and computing the corresponding color to effective temperature equation .",
    "it is clear that if we made no correction that the rsgs would be of considerably higher luminosity in the lmc than in the smc . in the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : mbolhists ] we compare the distribution of bolometric luminosities for rsgs both with and without these corrections .",
    "we see that without the corrections the number of rsgs in the smc drops very abruptly with increasing luminosity compared to the lmc .",
    "this runs counter to the expected evolutionary effect that at lower metallicities higher mass ( luminosity ) stars should spend a greater fraction of their he - burning lifetimes as rsgs rather than wrs since mass - loss rates will be lower at low metallicities ( see maeder et al .",
    "1980 and maeder & conti 1994 ) . indeed ,",
    "massey ( 1998b ) found a smooth decrease in the numbers of the highest luminosity rsgs as metallicity increased from ngc  6822 ( smc - like ) to m  33 ( lmc - like ) to m  31 ( higher than solar ) .",
    "when we make the correction for effective temperature , however , the luminosity functions become very similar ( right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : mbolhists ] .",
    "thus either a significant correction to the galactic @xmath63 scale is needed for smc rsgs , as we have made above , or else there is an unexpected absence of higher luminosity rsgs in the smc .",
    "we note that in the case of the h - r diagrams with the corrected temperatures that we expect that the most luminous rsgs come from stars with initial masses of about 40@xmath19 .",
    "this is consistent with so - called upper luminosity limit described by humphreys & davidson ( 1979 ) , and explained by lamers ( 1997 ) : the  modified \" eddington limit should prevent stars with luminosities above @xmath68 from evolving to the right in the h - r diagram .",
    "this limit should , if anything , be slightly higher at lower metallicities , since the opacities will be lower , and thus is consistent with our corrected temperatures .",
    "perhaps one of the most interesting things to be apparent in the h - r diagrams is that there is a very smooth decrease in effective temperature with increasing luminosity , whether or not the temperature corrections are applied . _",
    "the higher luminosity rsgs are invariably of cooler effective temperatures .",
    "_ this tight sequence is obviously not reproduced by the stellar evolutionary models . explaining this simple sequence provides an important challenge to stellar evolutionary theory .",
    "finally , let us briefly reconsider the ratio of blue - to - red supergiants ( b / r ) in the smc and the lmc .",
    "as emphasized in massey ( 2002 ) , one needs to be careful in what one is counting for this ratio to have much meaning .",
    "we need to include k - type as well as m - type stars , but would like to exclude stars earlier than k - type as the degree of foreground contamination increases at intermediate colors .",
    "we adopt the same convention as massey ( 2002a ) , namely @xmath26 , corresponding to a star of @xmath69 ( 4600@xmath2k , or late g - type ) .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to counting only stars with @xmath70 , as less luminous than this there is a chance of contamination by intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch stars ( brunish , gallagher , & truran 1986 ) . in counting stars",
    "we include all of the sufficiently luminous rsgs in tables  [ tab : smc ] and [ tab : lmc ] , plus a fraction of the other red stars from massey ( 2002a ) .",
    "our spectroscopy suggests that 11% of the red stars seen towards the smc , and 5.3% of the red stars seen towards the lmc are foreground , so we count only 89% and 94.7% of the remainder and @xmath71 , we started with the complete photometric catalog ( table 3 ) of massey ( 2002a ) rather than the list of just the red , luminous stars ( table 9 ) , but the differences are small . ] .",
    "we find that we expect about 90 rsgs in the smc sample , and 234 rsgs in the lmc sample .",
    "for the blue stars , we use the numbers given in table  10 of massey ( 2002 ) , i.e. , all of the stars in the smc and lmc areas surveyed that meet the criteria @xmath70 and @xmath72 , where the latter roughly corresponds to the color of an a9  i star ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we then count 1484 blue supergiants in the smc , and 3164 blue supergiants in the lmc , although these numbers are considerably uncertain given the difficulty in converting photometry to @xmath71 and @xmath64 for hot stars .",
    "( see , for example , massey et al .",
    "the derived b / r values are thus 16 for the smc , and 14 for the lmc , essentially identical . massey ( 2002 )",
    "notes that a large ( factor of 3 ) difference is found if only m - type stars are counted .",
    "thus the fact that the stellar models fail to reproduce the  observed \" b / r value ( langer & maeder 1995 ) may be in large part due to the differences in how the  observed \" ratios have actually been counted .",
    "the slightly different approach here has changed the b / r ratio given by massey ( 2002a ) by nearby a factor of 2 in itself , and thus we again emphasize the large  observational \" uncertainty in such a census , as the derived ratio is highly sensitive to the conversions to bolometric luminosity .",
    "we can compare this number to the predicted from stellar models .",
    "for this comparison we follow the advice offered by schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) to determine the number of stars from the model by integrating the initial mass function over closely - spaced isochrones rather than by integrating over the coarsely - spaced mass tracks . the smc - like @xmath65 geneva models with normal mass - loss rates ( charbonnel et al .  1993 )",
    "predict a blue - to - red supergiant ratio of 54 , while the enhanced mass - loss models ( meynet et al .",
    "1994 ) would expect a blue - to - red supergiant ratio of 36 .",
    "the lmc - like @xmath74 geneva models with normal mass - loss rates ( schaerer et al .",
    "1993 ) predict a b / r value of 10 , while those using enhanced mass - loss rates ( meynet et al .",
    "1994 ) predict a b / r value of 3 .",
    "thus , the lower metallicity models ( smc - like ) predict a much higher ratio of b / r than what is observed , while the intermediate metallicity models ( lmc - like ) predict a somewhat lower value . given that we have earlier shown that the models fail to reproduce the location of rsgs in the h - r diagram , the disagreement is not surprising .",
    "maeder & meynet ( 2001 ) find that more rsgs are produced in the models at smc - like metallicities when rotation is included .",
    "comparisons with the new rotation models that cover a range of metallicities will be of great interest .",
    "we have examined samples of red stars seen towards the smc and lmc .",
    "our spectroscopy has been able to determine membership based upon radial velocity information ; we find that the contamination by foreground red dwarfs is about 11% in the smc sample and 5.3% in the lmc sample .",
    "classification of our spectra confirms that there is a progression in the average spectral type of rsgs with metallicity .",
    "rsgs in the smc ( which is the lowest in metallicity ) have an average spectral type of k5 - 7  i. nevertheless , there are a few smc rsgs as late as m3 in our sample . in the lmc",
    "have an average type of m1  i , while those in the milky way have an average type of m2  i. at lower metallicity the appearance of the tio lines ( used as the primary classification criterion ) should be weaker , and examination of the kurucz ( 1992 ) atlas 9 models suggest that this effect is probably sufficient in itself to account for the shift in average spectral types observed .",
    "if so , then rsgs in the smc are about 300@xmath2 cooler than galactic stars of the same spectral types , while rsgs in the lmc are about 100@xmath2 cooler .",
    "the @xmath53 colors predicted by the kurucz ( 1992 ) models do not agree with this conclusion , but other models ( e.g. , bessell 1989 ) show better agreement with the smc data although lack the lmc - like metallicity we would need to draw conclusions . good resolution ( @xmath75 ) synthetic spectra for red supergiants ( @xmath40 ) covering a range of metallicities is needed ( along with good spectrophotometry ) to address this discrepancy .",
    "we find that none of the stellar evolutionary models produce rsgs that are as red and luminous as observed in the magellanic clouds .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to the treatment of convection in the evolutionary models , or could simply be due the lack of inclusion of that stellar winds have in increasing the atmosphere extent ( leading to a decrease in the effective temperature ) in the stellar models .",
    "nevertheless the location of rsgs compared to the evolutionary tracks suggest that the most luminous rsgs have evolved from stars with initial masses of 40@xmath19 , in accord with previous studies .",
    "we show that ignoring the temperature correction described above would lead to an under - abundance of high luminosity smc rsgs .",
    "the blue - to - red supergiant ratio does not appear to be significantly different in the smc and in the lmc , although there is still considerable uncertainty in the number of blue supergiants in our sample .",
    "this work has underscored the point made by massey ( 2002a ) that the b / r value is very dependent upon how stars are counted , and thus disagreements with the predictions of stellar evolutionary models have to be carefully evaluated .",
    "using the non - rotation geneva models , we find that the smc - like ( @xmath65 ) models predict too large a value for b / r , while the lmc - like ( @xmath74 ) models predict too small a value .",
    "given the fact that the models fail to produce high luminosity red supergiants , such disagreements are not surprising .",
    "the effects that rotation will have on the predicted b / r ratio as a function of metallicity remain unclear . as maeder & meynet ( 2000 ) describe , the additional mixing caused by rotational instabilities would tend to produce few rsgs , while on the other hand higher rotation will lead to increase mass loss , and this would tend to produce more rsgs .",
    "the result is that it is still unclear what affect , if any , the complete inclusion of rotation will have on the predictions of b / r ratios as a function of metallicities , although maeder & meynet ( 2001 ) find that at a smc - like metallicity including rotation will lower the predicted b / r ratio , which goes in the correction direction .",
    "eggenberger , meynet & maeder ( 2002 ) compare the observed b / r ratios of clusters to those of models , but as discussed extensively by massey ( 2002 , 2003 ) the  b / r \" ratio in a quasi - coeval situation will be quite different than in a mixed - age population , such as what we consider here .",

    "<S> we investigate the red supergiant ( rsg ) content of the smc and lmc using multi - object spectroscopy on a sample of red stars previously identified by _ bvr _ ccd photometry . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained high accuracy ( @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ) radial velocities for 118 red stars seen towards the smc and 167 red stars seen towards the lmc , confirming most of these ( 89% and 95% , respectively ) as red supergiants ( rsgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> spectral types were also determined for most of these rsgs . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the distribution of spectral types is skewed towards earlier type at lower metallicities : the average ( median ) spectral type is k5 - 7  i in the smc , m1  i in the lmc , and m2  i in the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> our examination of the kurucz atlas 9 model atmospheres suggests that the effect that metallicity has on the appearance on the tio lines is probably sufficient to account for this effect , and we argue that rsgs in the magellanic clouds are 100@xmath2k ( lmc ) and 300@xmath2k ( smc ) cooler than galactic stars of the same spectral types . </S>",
    "<S> the colors of the kurucz models are not consistent with this interpretation for the smc , although other models ( e.g. , bessel et al . ) show good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> a finer grid of higher - resolution synthetic spectra appropriate to cool supergiants is needed to better determine the effective temperature scale . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the distribution of rsgs in the h - r diagram to that of various stellar evolutionary models ; we find that none of the models produce rsgs as cool and luminous as what is actually observed . </S>",
    "<S> this result is much larger than any uncertainty in the effective temperature scale . </S>",
    "<S> we note that were we to simply adopt the uncorrected galactic effective scale for rsgs and apply this to our sample , then the smc s rsgs would be under luminous compared to the lmc s , contrary to what we expect from stellar evolution considerations . in all of our h - r diagrams </S>",
    "<S> , however , there is an elegant sequence of decreasing effective temperatures with increasing luminosities ; explaining this will be an important test of future stellar evolutionary models . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compute the blue - to - red supergiant ratio in the smc and lmc , finding that the values are indistinguishable ( @xmath3 ) for the two clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that  observed \" b / r values must be carefully determined if a comparison to that predicted by stellar models is to be meaningful . </S>",
    "<S> the non - rotation geneva models overestimate the number of blue - to - red supergiants for the smc , but underestimate it for the lmc ; however , given the inability to produce high luminosity rsgs in the models that match what is observed in the h - r diagram , such a disagreement is not surprising . </S>"
