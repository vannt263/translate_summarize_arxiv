    "the total hadronic cross section in @xmath8 scattering at electron ",
    "positron colliders is considered to be a suitable observable for studying the interesting dynamics of qcd at small @xmath9 . for sufficiently large photon virtualities",
    "one expects this process to be the optimal test of the perturbative ( bfkl ) pomeron @xcite .",
    "the process is being studied by the l3 and the opal collaborations @xcite at lep .",
    "first analytic calculations based upon the leading order ( lo ) bfkl approximation @xcite have been compared to measurements by the l3 collaboration @xcite . in the meantime various aspects of this process",
    "have been considered in more detail @xcite@xcite . in summary ,",
    "the present situation is similar to that of forward jets at hera @xcite .",
    "the data points for the total @xmath8 cross section lie above the two  gluon exchange approximation but clearly below the lo bfkl prediction .",
    "first attempts to include the nlo corrections @xcite ( see also @xcite ) to the bfkl approximation are encouraging @xcite but not yet conclusive : for a consistent nlo calculation of the @xmath8 cross section one also needs the nlo corrections to the photon impact factors which have not yet been calculated .",
    "but even the lo calculations still suffer from several theoretical uncertainties which we would like to discuss in this short note .",
    "the lo calculation of the @xmath8 cross section which has been compared with l3 data uses four massless quarks .",
    "due to the charge @xmath10 of the charm quark the cross section is multiplied by a factor of @xmath11 when going from three to four massless flavors .",
    "it is obviously very desirable to eliminate this big uncertainty .",
    "effects of the charm mass have so far only been considered in @xcite where a formula was given in @xmath9-space and its effect was not considered separately .",
    "we give a formula for the cross section for non  zero charm quark mass in mellin space and perform a numerical study which shows that the charm quark mass leads to a considerable reduction of the cross section expected for lep .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the cross section also depends on the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath1 which is not too well known at the ( comparatively small ) momentum scales dominating the kinematics at lep , especially at @xmath12 .",
    "our numerical study shows that the dependence on @xmath1 is rather strong .",
    "further , we briefly discuss the effect of taking into account contributions from all photon polarizations as well as the uncertainty associated with the bfkl energy scale .",
    "in the events of interest the scattered electron as well as the scattered positron are tagged ( ` double  tag events ' ) , and we define useful scaling variables ( we use the notation of @xcite ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the momenta of the electron and positron , respectively .",
    "we have y_i = 1 - ^2 ( ) , where @xmath17 is the beam energy , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the energy of the tagged lepton and its angle with respect to the beam axis , respectively . the virtualities of the photons are ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 and they are required to be large to make perturbation theory applicable . the squared center  of  mass energy of the @xmath22 collisions is @xmath23 , whereas for the underlying @xmath24 process the squared energy is given by @xmath25 we consider the limit where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are large and @xmath28 the differential @xmath22 cross section has been calculated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the total @xmath24 cross section is given by @xmath29 with @xmath30 the labels @xmath31 and @xmath32 refer to the transverse and longitudinal polarization of the incoming photon , respectively .",
    "in @xcite it has been argued that in the l3 region the @xmath33 have values larger than @xmath34 . for simplicity",
    "we take them as 1 which leads to a deviation of less than 3 percent . for the polarizations @xmath35 of the initial photons one",
    "finds [ gg ] _",
    "^*^*^ij = w_i ( , ) w_j ( - , ) , where @xmath36 is the typical bfkl energy scale which we choose as [ s0 ] s_0 = .",
    "further , [ chi ] ( ) = n_c_s/ , and @xmath37 denotes the digamma function . for massless",
    "quarks the functions @xmath38 are given in @xcite . for massive quarks we can use the results found in @xcite to obtain @xmath39 and @xmath40                  { } _ 2f_1 \\left ( \\frac{1}{2 } + i\\nu , \\frac{1}{2 } ; \\frac{3}{2 } ;                    \\frac{q_i^2}{q_i^2 + 4m_c^2 } \\right ) \\nn \\\\       & &   \\hspace{1.2 cm }       +   \\left [ ( 1-i\\nu ) \\frac{q_i^2}{q_i^2 + 4m_c^2}-                    \\frac{3 + 2 i\\nu}{4 } \\right ]              { } _ 2f_1 \\left(- \\frac{1}{2 } + i\\nu , \\frac{1}{2 } ; \\frac{3}{2 } ;              \\frac{q_i^2}{q_i^2 + 4m_c^2 } \\right )           \\biggl\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denotes the electric charge of the quark flavor @xmath42 .",
    "the terms containing @xmath43 correspond to the contribution of the charm quark . in the limit @xmath44 they can be simplified in such a way that the sum over flavours in the first terms is extended to include four flavours .",
    "the bottom quark  relevant to experiments at a future linear collider  can be included in the same way as the charm quark .",
    "( the contribution of the bottom quark is very small at lep and will be neglected in the following . )",
    "for our numerical analysis we use the kinematics of the l3 detector ( see also @xcite ) . at lep91",
    "the outgoing electrons close to the forward direction can be detected within the angles @xmath45 , and the electron energy required for tagging is @xmath46 .",
    "this leads to a range of possible photon virtualities 1.2 ^2 < q^2_1,2 < 9 ^2 , and the cross section is evaluated at the mean value @xmath47 .    at lep183",
    "the energy of the tagged electrons is restricted by @xmath48 , and the angular range is the same as at lep91 .",
    "the virtualities are 2.5 ^2 < q^2_1,2 < 35 ^2 , with the mean value @xmath49 .",
    "note that with these mean values of @xmath50 the available range for the rapidity @xmath51 is the same for lep91 and lep183 .    in the bfkl formalism",
    "the strong coupling @xmath1 is kept fixed , and the natural scale is @xmath52 . in our numerical study , however , we use a running coupling in order to arrive at an improved prediction for the cross section . specifically , we use a running @xmath1 in nnlo with four active flavours .",
    "the variation of @xmath1 at a given scale @xmath52 ( see below ) is then obtained by varying @xmath53 ( approximately between @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "the results of our numerical study are illustrated in the following figures .",
    "[ fig1a ] shows a comparison between the saddle point approximation to the bfkl cross section and the exact calculation of the lo bfkl pomeron , here for lep183 and for transversely polarized photons only .    in order to allow for a direct comparison with the theoretical curve used in @xcite , the curves in this and in the next figure",
    "are calculated for four massless quarks ( mass effects are discussed separately below ) . in @xcite",
    "the measured data have been compared to the saddle point approximation .",
    "we find that this approximation overestimates the exact cross section by 20% to 30% .",
    "[ fig1a ] also shows the cross section obtained from two  gluon exchange which approximates the full dglap formalism if the two photon virtualities are of the same order .",
    "next we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] the contributions of different polarizations of the two incoming photons , again for lep183 and with four massless quarks . clearly",
    "the sum of all polarization is substantially larger than the transverse contribution alone which was compared with data in @xcite .",
    "now we address the question how the cross section depends on the value of @xmath1 chosen at the scale @xmath56 . here and in the following",
    "we include the charm quark as a massive quark and sum over all photon polarizations , i.e.  we use eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) with ( [ gg ] ) , ( [ wqs ] ) , ( [ w2 ] ) .",
    "as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ gg ] ) and ( [ chi ] ) , @xmath1 enters in the exponent and thus we expect a strong dependence of the cross section on its particular value .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig2a ] and [ fig2b ] .",
    "[ fig2a ] shows the cross section for @xmath57 ( lep91 ) , and we study a spread @xmath58 of possible values . in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] we have plotted the cross section for @xmath59 ( lep183 ) , now varying @xmath1 between @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in @xcite",
    "the theoretical curves were obtained using @xmath62 for both energies . for lep91",
    "this choice appears very low . to obtain more realistic predictions ( see below ) , we choose @xmath63 ( lep91 ) and @xmath64 ( lep183 ) , respectively .",
    "a further uncertainty is the choice of the bfkl energy scale @xmath36 .",
    "strictly speaking , its value is not determined in the leading order bfkl formalism . in this sense , the choice ( [ s0 ] ) is only an educated guess .",
    "it is well possible that the true value differs from that choice by a factor of two , for example .",
    "choosing @xmath36 as twice ( half ) the value given in ( [ s0 ] ) results in a shift of the bfkl prediction to the right ( left ) by @xmath65 units in rapidity . shifting the curves in our figures by this",
    "value amounts to a considerable change in the lo bfkl prediction .",
    "however , the uncertainty in @xmath36 is less serious in the nlo bfkl calculation since there the typical curves are less steep and a horizontal shift results in a smaller absolute change of the cross section .",
    "finally , we study the effect of the charm quark mass on the cross section .",
    "our results ( including also the improvements discussed above ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] for lep91 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] for lep183 .",
    "for lep91 the charm quark mass reduces the cross section by about 30 % ( compared to a massless charm quark ) , for lep183 the cross section is reduced by about 20 % .",
    "the effect of the charm mass is different in the two cases due to the different mean values @xmath56 .",
    "it can be seen immediately from eqs .",
    "( [ wqs ] ) and ( [ w2 ] ) that the charm mass @xmath66 enters in such a combination with @xmath50 that for increasing @xmath50 the effect of a finite @xmath66 becomes weaker . also shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3a ] and [ fig3b ] are the data points measured by the l3 collaboration @xcite .",
    "one should note that in these data the contribution of the quark box diagram  or quark parton model ( qpm ) graph  has already been subtracted .",
    "this diagram is also not included in our calculation .    compared with the theoretical prediction used in @xcite we have made the following changes to arrive at the cross sections in figs .",
    "[ fig3a ] and [ fig3b ] : exact bfkl is used instead of the saddle point approximation , all photon polarizations are included , and a nonzero charm quark mass is used .",
    "further we have chosen a higher ( and more realistic ) value for @xmath1 in the case of lep91 .",
    "roughly speaking , the first three changes lead to a change in the normalization , whereas the last one results in a different energy dependence . for lep91",
    "we find a significantly larger cross section than the one given by the theoretical curve in @xcite . here",
    "the main effect is due to the choice of @xmath1 . for lep183",
    "our prediction is very close to the one used in @xcite because the changes almost compensate each other .",
    "however , one should have in mind that already a small change in @xmath1 leads to a visible modification of the energy dependence .    our predictions for the cross section are higher and exhibit a much faster rise with energy than the measured data points ( especially in the case of lep91 ) .",
    "this was to be expected since the nlo corrections to the bfkl equation are known to be sizable and lead to a slower rise with energy . certainly there is a good chance to successfully describe the data by a nlo bfkl calculation .",
    "however , also there one should keep in mind the uncertainties discussed above .",
    "our study of the bfkl prediction shows that there are substantial theoretical uncertainties even at the lo level . however ,",
    "also an improved treatment does not change the main conclusion : the lep data for the total hadronic @xmath24 cross section clearly indicate that a simple two  gluon exchange is not sufficient to describe the data .",
    "the lo bfkl prediction , on the other hand , lies well above the data . a consistent nlo calculation including the impact factors is therefore urgently needed .",
