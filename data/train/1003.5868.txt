    "in recent years considerable attention has been directed at producing directed transport in driven systems , in which the driving does not have a net bias .",
    "this type of ratchet effect  @xcite is important from the viewpoint of technology in controlling the passage of particles , ranging from electrons to nanospheres , and also to more unusual applications such as understanding the operation of biological molecular motors .",
    "the most well - studied form of ratchet physics arises from the interplay between dissipation and the driving potential .",
    "the paradigmatic example is given by a brownian particle in a periodic potential @xcite .",
    "the system is driven from equilibrium by periodically varying the potential , and a ratchet current is produced when the relevant space and time symmetries of the driven system , which would otherwise forbid the formation of a directed current @xcite , are broken .    perhaps surprisingly , however ,",
    "dissipation is not a necessary requirement for the production of a ratchet , and even in strictly hamiltonian systems a ratchet current can be produced @xcite .",
    "cold atoms loaded into optical lattices have emerged as excellent candidates to study such coherent ratchet effects , as the level of dissipation can be controlled rather precisely @xcite , and indeed such systems can be arranged to be essentially dissipation - free .",
    "initial investigations of ratchet - like behavior concentrated on the quantum kicked rotor , which can be realized in experiment by subjecting a gas of ultracold atoms to a pulsed optical lattice potential .",
    "this has allowed the detailed experimental investigation of quantum chaos effects such as dynamical localization @xcite and quantum resonances @xcite which can be harnessed to produce quantum coherent ratchets .    in this work we consider cold atoms subjected to an optical lattice potential that varies smoothly with time , instead of being pulsed .",
    "we can expect that a driving of this kind produces less heating than a kick - type potential , and accordingly will preserve the atomic coherence better .",
    "we consider a driving potential in which spatial and temporal symmetries can be separately controlled , giving extreme flexibility for probing and manipulating the system s properties .",
    "we firstly show that starting from an unbiased initial state , symmetric in both space and time , we are able to induce a directed current . through a perturbative study we find that this ratchet current arises from quantum interference between processes which are first- and second - order in the driving strength .",
    "we then provide a simple three - level model to describe its properties and find excellent agreement with the exact numerical simulations .",
    "we go on to show that the driving frequencies at which this current occurs obeys various resonance conditions and discuss the main features of these resonances .",
    "we consider a gas of cold bosonic particles held in a toroidal trap .",
    "if the lateral dimensions of the torus are much smaller than its radius @xmath0 the system becomes effectively one - dimensional .",
    "its low temperature dynamics are then well - described by the one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath1where the short - range interaction between the atoms is described by a mean - field term with strength @xmath2 .",
    "the atoms are driven by a time - periodic external potential @xmath3 with zero mean , produced by modulating the intensity of the optical lattice .",
    "we note that we measure all energies in units of the rotational constant @xmath4 , and set @xmath5 .",
    "the high level of control available in cold atom experiments allows us to take the unusual choice of factoring the driving potential into separate space and time components @xmath6 where @xmath7 gives the spatial dependence of the optical lattice potential , and @xmath8 describes the time - dependence of its intensity .",
    "the archetypal form of a symmetry - breaking ratchet potential @xcite is @xmath9 , where spatial inversion symmetry is unbroken for @xmath10 , and is maximally broken for @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly we choose to take @xmath12where the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 separately control the spatial and temporal symmetries of the driving .",
    "an experimental realization of such a driving potential in a cold atom system was recently described in ref . .",
    "the strength of the driving is denoted by @xmath15 , and we shall , in this paper , restrict ourselves to using small values of @xmath15 for which the system shows a regular response . as @xmath15 is increased the dynamics shows a rich quasiperiodic behavior , and we refer the reader to ref . for a discussion of this and its consequences .    in ref .",
    "we studied the dynamics under the driving ( [ vxt])-([drive ] ) when the system was initially prepared in the spatially - uniform , time - symmetric state @xmath16 this is convenient for experiment as it is the ground state of the undriven hamiltonian , and so can be prepared using standard cooling techniques .",
    "clearly the symmetry of this state prevents it from carrying a current .",
    "we numerically integrate the wavefunction in time using a split - operator method , in each case checking that the time - discretization , @xmath17 , is sufficiently small to produce converged results .",
    "the size of @xmath17 depended strongly on the amplitude of the driving , @xmath15 , with the surprising result that smaller values of @xmath15 demand a much finer discretization to produce converged results .",
    "as an additional verification , results were also checked using a fourth - order runge - kutta technique . to probe the behavior of the system",
    "we evaluate @xmath18 as a measure of the current flowing in the ring .",
    "we note that the expectation value of the momentum operator determines the velocity of free propagation in a time - of - flight experiment after the optical confinement is released .",
    "reference focused on the case of driving frequency @xmath19 .",
    "it was found that for small @xmath15 and small or moderate @xmath2 the current exhibits large sinusoidal oscillations , with a period of @xmath20 driving periods , which clearly averaged to a non - zero value . as the non - linearity , @xmath2 ,",
    "is increased from zero , the oscillations in current are initially enhanced , together with a deformation of the waveform , and then become abruptly suppressed above a critical interaction strength .",
    "this smooth time - periodic behavior of the current for zero or small interaction strength , clearly implies that the driving induces an oscillation between the initial state and a single excited state .",
    "examining the time evolution in detail , it was found that this oscillation occurs chiefly between @xmath21 ( the initial state ) and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes an eigenstate of the undriven hamiltonian with quantized angular momentum @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that , for weak driving and weak interactions , we can model the dynamics very efficiently by using an effective hamiltonian operating in a reduced hilbert space of a small number of states . the main goal of this paper is to study the weak - driving limit in greater detail .",
    "the resulting perturbative analysis gives an excellent account of the system s ratchet dynamics .",
    "we focus on the behavior of a system governed by the the time - dependent schdinger equation @xmath25 and we will concentrate on the non - interacting case , @xmath26 , with an initial wave function ( [ initial - wf ] ) .",
    "the time - periodicity of the hamiltonian @xmath27 implies that solutions of the schrdinger equation are given by time - periodic functions known as floquet states , analogous to the bloch wave solutions familiar from studies of spatially - periodic systems .",
    "floquet states are of the general form@xmath28 where @xmath29 is a time - periodic function and the quasienergy @xmath30 is defined modulo @xmath31 .",
    "we also note that our hamiltonian is of the form@xmath32where @xmath33 is given by the driving ( [ vxt])-([drive ] ) . for small @xmath15",
    "we expect that a suitable perturbative study will yield the floquet states from the eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian , which satisfy@xmath34 where @xmath23 is an eigenstate of the momentum along the ring with space - periodic boundary conditions , with the wavefunction @xmath35 and unperturbed energy @xmath36 .",
    "we note first that the time - periodic functions satisfy the equation @xmath37\\phi_j(t)=\\varepsilon _ { j}\\phi_j(t)~.   \\label{h - u}\\]]since we are interested in the case of space - periodic boundary conditions , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we may exploit the combined periodicity in @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( i.e. on the square @xmath42\\times \\lbrack 0,t]$ ] ) and map the dynamics into a time - independent problem in an effective two - dimensional geometry .",
    "specifically , we make the replacement @xmath43  and rewrite eq .",
    "( [ schrodinger ] ) as an eigenvalue equation @xmath44 \\phi _ { j}(x , y)=\\varepsilon _ { j}\\phi _ { j}(x , y )   \\label{eqn : making time spatial}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .",
    "the generalized hamiltonian defined in ( [ eqn : making time spatial ] ) is hermitian .",
    "its only anomaly is that it is not bounded from below , but this does not prevent us from applying standard tools that do not rely on the existence of a minimum energy .",
    "so finding the floquet states ( [ floquet ] ) satisfying ( [ schrodinger ] ) amounts to solving the hermitian eigenvalue problem ( [ eqn : making time spatial ] ) .",
    "we recall that the driving , @xmath46[\\sin ( \\omega y)+\\beta \\cos ( 2\\omega y)]~ , \\label{vxy}\\ ] ] is small , so a useful starting point is given by the unperturbed floquet states in the @xmath47 representation , which satisfy@xmath48 where@xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are integers .",

    "[ gspaceomega - four ] . in each of these figures ,",
    "the blue circles indicate the @xmath63 vectors that satisfy the resonance condition ( [ resonance ] ) , which can also be written as@xmath64 and whose continuous version is represented by the green parabola .        in this peculiar @xmath47 space all resonant states",
    "are degenerate  with energy @xmath65 .",
    "these states are connected by the driving ( [ vxy ] ) , ( [ v - fourier ] ) . by construction",

[ gspaceomega - four ] .",
    "thus we expect the driving to mix @xmath70 with the other resonant floquet states satisfying @xmath71 .",
    "let us focus first on the case @xmath19 ( upper - left graph of fig .",
    "[ gspaceomega - four ] ) .",
    "starting from the state@xmath72 we expect the system to evolve from @xmath70 towards @xmath73 and latexmath:[$%    under the effect of driving the state @xmath70 will also mix with higher - lying unperturbed floquet states , but we may expect that mixing to be weaker as it involves higher powers in the fourier components @xmath75 , all of which are small because @xmath15 is assumed to be small . thus a truncated hilbert space spanned only by the floquet states @xmath76 may suffice to describe the dynamics under weak driving .",
    "the next section is devoted to the formulation of the three - level model .",
    "inspection of the upper - left fig .",
    "[ gspaceomega - four ] strongly suggests that for @xmath19 , the mixing between @xmath70 and e.g. the state @xmath77 once , and the the second - order process involving @xmath78 twice ( with @xmath61 given in the units of the array there shown ) , while visiting the state @xmath79 virtually . in this section",
    "we calculate the effective matrix elements which account for this first- and second - order mixing in an effective time - independent problem defined in the @xmath47 space .",
    "first we note that , in this @xmath47 representation , we deal with a formally time - independent problem defined by the hamiltonian@xmath80 where @xmath81 is given in ( [ h - not ] ) and @xmath82 by ( [ vxy ] ) . the full green function @xmath83 can be related to its unperturbed counterpart @xmath84 through the dyson equation @xcite @xmath85 one may also describe the effect of the perturbation @xmath82 in terms of the @xmath86-matrix ( not to be confused with the time - period ) satisfying@xmath87 or , equivalently , @xmath88 thus the effective dynamics up to second order in @xmath82 may be described in terms of an effective @xmath86-matrix approximated as@xmath89 finding the matrix elements of this approximate , second - order @xmath86-matrix is equivalent to finding those of an effective @xmath90 which , treated to first order , yields the correct second - order dynamics .",
    "so the next goal is to compute the matrix elements @xmath91 applying the closure relation to ( [ approx - t ] ) we obtain@xmath92 where @xmath93 is a short - hand notation for the quantum numbers @xmath94 .    for the case",
    "@xmath19 we restrict our analysis to the matrix elements between the three resonant states @xmath95 .",
    "these three states have an unperturbed energy @xmath96 , so in ( [ matrix - element ] ) we focus on the shell @xmath97 .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ gspaceomega - four ] clearly shows that the intermediate state @xmath98 connecting @xmath70 and @xmath73 is @xmath79 , while @xmath99 is the intermediary between @xmath70 and @xmath100 .",

    "returning to the real time ( @xmath114 ) picture , it is clear that if the system is initially prepared in a given state @xmath115 , its subsequent evolution for @xmath116 , when the driving is on [ we assume ( [ vxt ] ) is multiplied by a step function @xmath117 , can be economically written as an expansion in the complete basis of the floquet states , of general form ( [ floquet ] ) @xmath118 in this sense the floquet states represent a generalization of the standard energy eigenstates of static hamiltonians to the case of time - periodic systems .    within our perturbative approach",
    ", we have seen that the three - level picture reduces in each case to a two - state ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "thus , if the initial state is @xmath120 , or @xmath121 , the system will undergo a simple oscillation of the rabi type between the unperturbed floquet states @xmath21 and @xmath122 . the frequency of those oscillations will be @xmath123",
    ". oscillations of exactly this type were observed in the numerical investigation of this model in ref . and in the recent experimental investigation @xcite .",
    "as well as evaluating the time - dependent current , it is also convenient to calculate the _ time - averaged _ current .",
    "this is particularly important to verify the existence of a long - lasting ratchet effect , which requires that the time - averaged current remains non - zero as the observation period tends to infinity .",
    "such time - averages can be formed in two distinct ways .",
    "the first is the _ stroboscopic _ average , in which the current is evaluated only at discrete times @xmath124 , where @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "it can be defined as @xmath126 this is frequently the scheme of measurement most convenient for experiment .",
    "one example is when the driving potential @xmath3 is obtained by periodically accelerating and decelerating the optical lattice , thereby producing an inertial force in the rest frame of the lattice .",
    "measurements of the current , however , are made in the rest frame of the laboratory , and so it is convenient to make measurements at times when the laboratory and lattice rest frames coincide , which occurs stroboscopically .",
    "the other averaging scheme is a _ continuous _ time average , @xmath127 when the period of the driving is much shorter than the response of the system , these averages will coincide at long times . however , for lower driving frequencies it is possible that the two time - averages will yield different results , as the stroboscopic sampling will only capture a subset of the system s dynamics . at long times ( @xmath128 ) ,",
    "we can use ( [ i - t ] ) , ( [ floquet - expansion ] ) , ( [ strobo - average ] ) , and ( [ cont - average ] ) to write these time - averaged currents as @xmath129 in ( [ eqn : time averaged currents ] ) we have assumed that @xmath130 for all @xmath131 .",
    "once the driving has been switched on and rabi oscillations have started , the system will spend , on average , half its time in @xmath21 and @xmath122 .",
    "thus the analytical prediction for the ratchet current is simply ( @xmath132 ) @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the current carried by @xmath122 .",
    "we first consider the case of the main resonance @xmath135 . in this case",
    "the rabi oscillation occurs between @xmath136 and @xmath137 given by ( [ state - a ] ) , with frequency @xmath138 we note that , in our reduced units , the states @xmath139 and @xmath140 , carry currents 2 and -2 , respectively . as a result , the ratchet current can be shown to be @xmath141from ( [ ratchet - current ] ) the beautiful picture emerges of a coherent ratchet current stemming from the interference between first- and second - order processes creating an imbalance between the matrix elements coupling the initial , time - symmetric state @xmath21 to the current - carrying states @xmath22 and @xmath142 .",
    "most importantly , the ratchet current exists only if both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are nonzero , i.e. if the driving is _ both _ space- and time - asymmetric , in agreement with the symmetry analysis provided in @xcite .",
    "we can further observe that the ratchet current is a unique function of the product @xmath143 , and for this driving frequency the ratchet current is maximized for @xmath144 , in excellent agreement with the experimental observation @xcite .",
    "figure [ rabi ] shows the extremely good agreement between the analytical prediction of the three - level model and the full numerical simulation for the time - dependent ratchet current in the weak coupling case ( @xmath145 ) . in particular",
    ", this means that the analytical predictions ( [ rabi - frequency ] ) and ( [ ratchet - current ] ) for the rabi frequency and the long - time ratchet current become essentially exact in the weak - driving limit .",

    "the three - level model predicts rabi oscillations which fit the exact results extremely well for weak driving ( @xmath145 ) . for strong",

    "the @xmath135 peak is considerably larger than the others , and it is interesting to note that the response for @xmath150 is of opposite sign to the other peaks .",
    "this peak is also unusual in its sensitivity to the averaging procedure used ; the stroboscopic result is larger and broader than the continuous time - average . in the inset",
