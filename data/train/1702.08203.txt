    "recently , several studies were devoted to examining the spread of epidemics on networks in which nodes represent individuals and edges represent their social or sexual relationships through which an infectious disease spreads ( as shown in review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "theoretical studies for epidemiological models demonstrated that infectious diseases could spread very easily in highly heterogeneous networks @xcite .",
    "specifically , two fundamental epidemic models , namely the susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) model @xcite and the susceptible - infected - susceptible model @xcite , exhibit outbreaks of finite relative sizes with an infinitesimal infection rate if the underlying network is fat - tailed scale - free such that the degree distribution obeys @xmath0 with @xmath1 @xcite .    in order to contain epidemics , several control measures were proposed that utilize network information .",
    "epidemics can be suppressed by effective vaccination schemes such as the target vaccination @xcite , the acquaintance vaccination @xcite , the pagerank based vaccination @xcite , and the graph partitioning vaccination @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the above vaccination schemes succeed in containing epidemics in which a network is highly heterogeneous although these vaccination schemes are considered as a preventive measure wherein it is necessary to complete vaccinations prior to the appearance of an infectious disease in a network .    with respect to post - outbreak strategies",
    ", previous studies examined local control measures in which susceptible individuals who were in contact with an infected individual are vaccinated or isolated @xcite .",
    "dybiec et al .",
    "@xcite considered a spatial epidemic model in a situation in which individuals can be infectious prior to exhibiting symptoms ( and therefore prior to detection ) , and a local control measure is probabilistically applied in a neighborhood centered around a detected infectious individual .",
    "the results indicated the optimal radius necessary for the fore - mentioned type of a control neighborhood to contain epidemics in terms of economic costs associated with disease and treatment .",
    "takeuchi and yamamoto @xcite studied a ring vaccination in which susceptible individuals who came in contact with infected ones were probabilistically vaccinated .",
    "the findings revealed that the ring vaccination scheme reduced the infection rate and the number of vaccinated nodes becomes considerably small when compared to those in the preventive strategies .",
    "however , the basic reproduction number ( and thus the epidemic threshold ) remained equal to those of random preventive vaccination , and this failed to contain epidemics in a highly heterogeneous network unless almost all individuals were vaccinated .",
    "there are also studies investigating dynamic reactions of individuals to the spread of epidemics @xcite , such as behavioral responses of individuals by reducing their contact rates @xcite , based on the number of infected neighbors or by rewiring connections ( i.e. disconnecting their connections to infected neighbors and reconnecting others ) @xcite .    in order to clarify the extent to which an ideal quarantine measure suppresses epidemics , the present study considers a simple case in which an individual is detected with a probability immediately after it becomes infected and the detected one and its neighbors are promptly quarantined .",
    "the efficiency of the prompt quarantine measure is numerically and analytically investigated to suppress sir epidemics in typical networks in terms of the mean outbreak size , the epidemic threshold , and the occurrence probability of global outbreaks .",
    "the prompt quarantine measure is highly effective in containing epidemics , and it can theoretically eradicate epidemics in highly heterogeneous networks even when infected individuals are detected with a very small probability . the numerical simulations also indicate that the quarantine measure is effective in real networks .",
    "a discrete - time sir model in a network is considered . for a given network with @xmath2 nodes",
    ", each node corresponds to one of the following three states : susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) , or removed ( r ) .",
    "any s node can be infected by contact with adjacent i nodes .",
    "an i node infects each of its s neighbors independently with probability @xmath3 and then spontaneously becomes r. a node that changes to the state r loses its capability to infect other nodes and does not change its state any further .",
    "the dynamics of the whole system is as follows :    1 .   randomly select a node as a seed . as an initial configuration ,",
    "all nodes except the seed are set to s and the seed is set to i. 2 .",
    "randomly select an i node @xmath4 .",
    "compile a new list of the s neighbors of node @xmath4 . randomly select a node from the list and change its state from s to i with probability @xmath3 .",
    "repeat this procedure until the list is empty and then change the state of node @xmath4 to r. 3 .",
    "continue step 2 until i nodes cease to exist .",
    "that is , each node belongs to either s or r state in a final configuration .",
    "the sir model placed on a network has an epidemic threshold @xmath5 , in which an epidemic commencing from a seed terminates at an early stage for @xmath6 , and a seed can cause a global outbreak ( an outbreak of a finite relative size ) for @xmath7 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath8 defined by the mean fraction of the r nodes in final configurations is used to obtain @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "the epidemic threshold depends on the structure of the underlying network . with respect to uncorrelated networks with degree distribution @xmath14 ,",
    "the local tree approximation gives @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath16 represents the average of a quantity weighted by @xmath14 .",
    "this indicates that it is considerably easier for a global outbreak to occur on heterogeneous networks when compared to homogeneous networks : @xmath17 for fat - tailed scale - free networks ( sfns ) of @xmath0 with @xmath18 , although @xmath19 for random graphs ( rgs ) in which the degree distribution obeys @xmath20 with the same mean degree as that of the sfns .",
    "this is followed by introducing a prompt quarantine measure with respect to the sir model .",
    "the proposed quarantine measure assumes that node @xmath4 can be detected ( for example , by public health authorities ) with a detection probability @xmath21 immediately after it becomes infected , and the detected node @xmath4 and its neighbors ( except nodes already removed or quarantined ) are promptly isolated .",
    "the detected and quarantined nodes lose the capability to infect others and to be further infected .",
    "it is also assumed that nodes already infected are cured by appropriate treatments when they are isolated . in order to incorporate this quarantine measure ,",
    "an extended sir model is considered by introducing the following additional states : detected ( d ) and quarantined ( q ) .",
    "the complete dynamics is modified as follows :    1 .",
    "randomly select an i node @xmath4 . compile a new list of the s neighbors of node @xmath4 . randomly select a node @xmath22 from the list . with probability @xmath3 ,",
    "a disease is transmitted from node @xmath4 to node @xmath22 .",
    "change the state of @xmath22 to d with probability @xmath21 and to i otherwise .",
    "if node @xmath22 becomes d , then change the state of its s or i neighbors to q and go to step 3 .",
    "otherwise , repeat the procedure until the list is empty , and subsequently change the state of node @xmath4 to r.    it should be noted that an i node attempts to infect each of its s neighbors but this type of a process stops immediately when one of its neighbors becomes d.    , as a function of @xmath3 , for ( a ) the rgs and ( b ) the sfns . here",

    "to test the efficiency of the quarantine measure to suppress epidemics , monte carlo simulations are performed for the sir model with the quarantine measure in the two following typical networks : the uncorrelated sfns with @xmath26 that are realized by the configuration model @xcite , and the rgs with the same mean degree as the sfns , i.e. @xmath27 . the number of nodes is @xmath28 .",
