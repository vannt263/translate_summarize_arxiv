    "many models of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) have an extra abelian gauge group @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "there are many options for this @xmath1 gauge symmetry and the corresponding @xmath0 from the broken symmetry can enable its identification .",
    "the drell - yan process , wherein the @xmath0 is produced from quark - antiquark fusion and decays to a lepton - antilepton pair , can give a particularly clear signal at a hadron collider @xcite .    however , the lepton pair search for a @xmath0 is nullified if the @xmath0 does not couple to the sm leptons .",
    "searches can still be made for dijet decay products of a @xmath0 , but the qcd dijet backgrounds are huge and fog such a signal @xcite ; hence , a @xmath0 resonance may not be discovered in dijets @xcite , especially if its coupling strength to quarks is not large , although a signal in the top pair channel could be easier to recognize @xcite .",
    "our interest here is in a 4-lepton signal from a leptophobic @xmath0 that can be produced at the lhc ( and the tevatron ) with a large cross section and give a 4-lepton signal comparable to that of the lepton pair signals of generic @xmath0 models .",
    "specifically , we consider a @xmath0 resonance in which the 4-leptons final state is bridged by pair production of a new scalar boson ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 couples to quark pairs and @xmath2 , but not to lepton pairs , and the new scalar @xmath2 decays into a lepton pair ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4leptonresonance ] ) .",
    "lhc experiments , and possibly tevatron experiments , can find or reject this distinctive 4-lepton signal .",
    "a leptophobic @xmath0 may also appear as a resonance in a 6-lepton final state ; a future search for this signal at the lhc requires @xmath3 integrated luminosity at @xmath4 center - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xcite .",
    "resonance diagram at a hadron collider.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "we begin by introducing a specific model in which a 4-lepton @xmath0 resonance can be realized without having a corresponding lepton pair signal .",
    "we consider a generic supersymmetry ( susy ) framework where scalar fields are abundant .",
    "the baryon number ( @xmath5 ) is not preserved in the susy framework and in general the proton is unstable .",
    "thus a gauged @xmath5 has been sought , but then additional fermions are required to cancel the anomaly @xcite .",
    "one natural way of anomaly cancellation is to add a fourth - generation ( 4 g ) of fermions .",
    "then , by requiring all quarks carry @xmath6 , the 4 g lepton charge is uniquely determined to be @xmath7 by the anomaly free condition :    rlcrc & @xmath8 , &   & & @xmath9 , + & @xmath8 , &   & & -@xmath10 .",
    "+    this is effectively @xmath11 for the sm fermions : every sm quark has @xmath5 as a charge , and every sm lepton has @xmath9 charge can be a possible source of the @xmath12 anomaly recently reported in the tevatron cdf experiment @xcite . ] .",
    "although proton stability would not have been guaranteed once the @xmath11 is broken spontaneously , it turned out there exists a residual @xmath13 discrete symmetry , called baryon tetrality ( @xmath14 ) , that forbids proton decay @xcite . under @xmath14 , lepton number",
    "violating operators can exist ( such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , but not baryon number violating operators ( such as @xmath17 ) .    in order to have the @xmath14 residual discrete symmetry , the higgs boson that spontaneously breaks the @xmath11 gauge symmetry ( typically , a new higgs singlet ) should have a @xmath11 charge of @xmath10 or @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "since it coincides with the @xmath11 charge of the @xmath18 [ 4 g right - handed neutrino and sneutrino ( superpartner of neutrino ) ] , we can adopt the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the 4 g right - handed sneutrino ( let us call it @xmath19 ) with a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is used to break the @xmath11 without the need for a separate singlet . in general , the 4 g sneutrino ( left - handed one ) can also have a vev through a mixing although we will assume the mixing is very small .    because the 4 g majorana neutrino mass term is forbidden by the @xmath11 symmetry ,",
    "the 4 g neutrino is a dirac particle on which the seesaw mechanism does not work , and thus can easily satisfy the lep @xmath20 width measurement that is compatible only with 3 light active neutrinos @xcite .",
    "we take the 4 g sneutrino ( @xmath21 ) , the spin-0 companion of the 4 g neutrino , as a bridging scalar between the @xmath0 and the lepton final states .",
    "it has a nonzero @xmath11 charge @xmath22 and can couple to the @xmath0 while the sneutrinos of the first 3 generations have vanishing @xmath11 charge .",
    "we assume the @xmath21 is the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) ; it can decay into a lepton pair through the lepton number violating interaction @xmath23 .",
    "( for instance , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) a nonzero @xmath11 charge for the 3-generation sneutrinos would inevitably have led to 2-lepton @xmath0 resonance @xcite .",
    "in the remainder of this paper , we focus on the collider physics consequences of this scenario with the @xmath21 lsp .",
    "our analysis does not necessitate this particular supersymmetric model , albeit well motivated .",
    "rather , the model serves as an existence proof of a consistent theory of the 4-lepton @xmath0 resonance without a 2-lepton @xmath0 resonance , and also provides a specific realization of the phenomenology of a new scalar that couples to the @xmath0 and lepton pairs .",
    "here , we discuss some characteristic features of the @xmath21 lsp decay exclusively through lepton number violating operators .",
    "renormalizable operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 are forbidden by the @xmath11 gauge symmetry .",
    "although operators with two 4 g fields such as @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) are allowed at the renormalizable level , @xmath21 decays can not be mediated by these operators due to kinematics when @xmath21 is the lightest of the 4 g states .",
    "thus , nonrenormalizable operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 with a heavy mass parameter @xmath31 allow @xmath21 decays since @xmath32 = 4 $ ] .",
    "taking @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , for instance , effective coefficients @xmath36 , @xmath37 are obtained is expected in susy to keep the extra @xmath38-term contribution to the sfermion masses small , and @xmath39 satisfies bounds on the scale of new physics from various constraints such as neutral kaon mixing . ] .    neglecting the light fermion masses ,",
    "we obtain the partial widths & & ( _ 4 ^+_j ^-_k ) = ( ^eff_4jk)^2 m__4 , + & & ( _ 4 |d_j d_k ) = ( ^eff_4jk)^2 m__4 .",
    "if we take all @xmath40 , the @xmath21 lsp would decay only through @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) with a total decay width given by  _ _ 4 = .",
    "it is demanded that @xmath43 by the result of the lep @xmath20 decay experiment .",
    "the @xmath44 can be constrained by various experiments such as @xmath45 , @xmath46 and similar @xmath47 decays .",
    "the bounds depend on the final lepton flavor indices ( @xmath48 ) , and currently the most severe bound comes from @xmath49 , which translates into @xmath50 for @xmath51 . in a flavor - blind sense , it corresponds to @xmath52 for the @xmath21 lsp with the other @xmath53 s sufficiently heavy @xcite .",
    "that is @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , which falls into the ballpark of the aforementioned @xmath58 value for @xmath59 .",
    "larger @xmath58 may be allowed for a specific choice of @xmath60 as the experimental bounds are flavor - dependent .",
    "because of many free parameters in @xmath61 , a wide range of @xmath62 for a given @xmath63 can be accommodated .         + ( a )   ( b )   ( c )",
    "in this section we present quantitative cross section predictions of the 4-leptons channel for the lhc7 ( lhc with @xmath64 cm energy ) experiments . for the calculations we use comphep / calchep @xcite , with some modifications , and the parton distribution function of cteq6l @xcite .    for definiteness ,",
    "we take the @xmath0 gauge coupling constant to be @xmath65 ; the @xmath0 production cross section and @xmath0 width can be simply scaled by @xmath66 for other @xmath67 values .",
    "we assume that the @xmath21 lsp is the lightest 4 g field , with @xmath56 , and that all new particles , except for the @xmath21 lsp , have masses larger than @xmath68 so that @xmath0 decays only into the sm fermions and the @xmath21 pair .",
    "thus , the total @xmath0 width we take is the minimum value , which is @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "the 4-lepton @xmath0 resonance cross section is ( p p 4 ) ( p p z ) br(z _ 4 _ 4^ * ) br(_4 2)^2 .",
    "the branching fraction is @xmath71 for @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath21 branching fractions to the light leptons ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) are parameter dependent and flavor nonuniversality is expected .",
    "we shall illustrate the case @xmath75 , which is indeed possible to arrange .    figure  [ fig : plots ] ( a ) shows the @xmath0 production cross section at the lhc ( solid curve ) and tevatron ( dashed curve ) , for the @xmath0 mass range @xmath76 .",
    "the low mass region would have been excluded by the dilepton @xmath0 resonance searches at the lhc had a @xmath0 coupled to the light leptons .",
    "for instance , the current bound on the sequential @xmath0 model is already @xmath77 @xcite though its couplings are larger than our benchmark coupling .",
    "the ratio of the tevatron to lhc @xmath0 production cross sections is about @xmath78 for @xmath79 , and it drops rapidly at higher @xmath80 . though it might be possible to have an observable 4-lepton resonance at the tevatron , especially for the low @xmath0 mass region , we will focus on the lhc experiments in our analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : plots ] ( b ) shows the 4-lepton @xmath0 resonance cross section at the lhc after the following typical acceptance cuts and @xmath0 invariant mass cut : + @xmath81 ( i ) @xmath82  ( each lepton ) , + @xmath81 ( ii ) @xmath83  ( each lepton ) , + @xmath81 ( iii ) @xmath84  ( 4-leptons ) .",
    "the sm 4-lepton background to @xmath72 and @xmath74 pairs is principally from the @xmath85 subprocess .",
    "as a recent atlas analysis shows , with nearly the same @xmath86 and @xmath87 cuts as ours , the sm background is negligible when the @xmath88 mass is outside the @xmath20 window of @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some 4-lepton combinations ( such as @xmath90 , @xmath91 ) do not have any significant sm backgrounds .",
    "thus , through all the @xmath0 mass range , we will require a small number of 4-lepton events ( 10 events ) after the acceptance cuts , in order to estimate the discovery reach .",
    "figure  [ fig : plots ] ( c ) shows the required luminosity at lhc7 to realize a signal of 10 events at a 4-lepton resonance as read from fig .",
    "[ fig : plots ] ( b ) . for @xmath65 , an integrated luminosity at lhc7 of @xmath92 is needed for discovery ( 10 events ) of @xmath93 .",
    "the existence of a 4-lepton @xmath0 resonance is already being probed at lhc7 in terms of the @xmath94 and @xmath67 ( with 3-events criteria and @xmath95 ) @xcite gives @xmath96 for @xmath65 . ] and an integrated luminosity of @xmath97 in each detector is expected before the end of 2011 .",
    "the current lhc dijet search results ( with @xmath98 ) do not constrain the model for @xmath99 , as can be deduced from the estimates in ref .  @xcite .",
    "a 4-lepton signal could be confused initially with a possible higgs signal from @xmath100 with each @xmath20 decaying to lepton pairs .",
    "there are several distinguishing characteristics of the signals : ( i ) @xmath20 decay includes neutrino decay modes that are absent in @xmath21 decay ; ( ii ) @xmath21 can decay into different lepton flavors which allows final states like @xmath90 and @xmath91 , although these could be switched off by @xmath101 ; ( iii ) the angular distribution of leptons in their rest frame is flat for the scalars ( higgs and sneutrino ) , but @xmath102-dependent for the vectors ( @xmath20 and @xmath0 ) ; ( iv ) if the @xmath21 mass differs from the @xmath20 boson mass , the lepton pair invariant mass distributions from the sneutrino decays would peak at a value different from @xmath103 , either lower or higher ; and ( v ) @xmath100 should be accompanied by @xmath104 , with a ratio of about 1 to 2 .",
    "another exotic possibility for 4-lepton events is that a higgs - like boson is produced via gluon - gluon fusion and it decays to a pair of hidden sector fields ( vectors or scalars ) , each of which then decay to two leptons @xcite .",
    "the production cross section for a higgs boson via gluon - gluon fusion would be much larger at lhc7 than at the tevatron .",
    "though we have limited ourselves to only 4-lepton events , it is straightforward to extend the idea to other 4-fermion resonances depending on the values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 , such as @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , etc .",
    "we have discussed a novel @xmath0 search channel in which a 4-lepton @xmath0 resonance can be produced at the lhc without an accompanying 2-lepton @xmath0 resonance signal .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to construct a consistent supersymmetric model which has a @xmath0 particle with this property .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry of the model respects the baryon number for the first three generations .",
    "the model is made anomaly free by the addition of a fourth generation of fermions .",
    "then the @xmath0 can decay to the fourth generation sneutrino pair , which in turn decay into lepton pairs , thus giving the 4-lepton resonance signal .",
    "the @xmath0 and the @xmath21 can be discovered or excluded in the near future by the lhc experiments .",
