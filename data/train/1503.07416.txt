    "solid liquid phase transitions are of great scientific interest . the equilibrium properties of this physical process are fairly well understood in the context of classical density functional theory ( cdft ) of freezing @xcite .",
    "this theory characterizes the equilibrium state of a pairwise interacting set of particles in terms of the one particle density field .",
    "the density function @xmath0 represents the spatial distribution of particles , i.e. , the probability of finding a particle at some point in space .",
    "this function at equilibrium is represented as a minimizer of a free energy , which in turn is a functional of the density . at equilibrium",
    "this function admits two forms of solutions corresponding to a homogeneous distribution known as the liquid phase and the inhomogeneous distribution known as the solid phase .",
    "the inhomogeneous distribution typically consists of peaks located on an ordered bravais lattice representing the probable locations of atoms .",
    "this approach is attractive for the reason that the equilibrium solid phase carries the information about the lattice symmetries .",
    "a non - equilibrium time dependent theory that characterizes the non - equilibrium distribution has the potential to capture lattice - dependent anisotropic effects such as defect formation and microstructure evolution .",
    "such models have many potential applications in the area of materials modeling .",
    "consequently , the development of time dependent models has been the focus of recent research @xcite .",
    "given a free energy functional @xmath1 $ ] the simplest dynamical equations for the evolution of the density field are to use gradient dynamics on the free energy surface @xcite .",
    "while this approach is appealing it has several shortcomings including the inability to capture the inertial effects and the effect of flow on the phase transition .",
    "hydrodynamic coupling has been incorporated in models involving colloidal suspensions @xcite and in models that describe the freezing of a dense hard sphere gas @xcite . in all these approaches the hydrodynamic model takes the form of a compressible navier - stokes - like equations where the pressure ( @xmath2 ) is defined by the equation of state @xmath3",
    "this can be easily seen from a thermodynamic point of view through the gibbs duhem relation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the chemical potential taken to be the variational derivative of the free energy @xcite .",
    "models for hydrodynamic coupling with solid - liquid phase transitions thus take the form @xmath6where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath1 $ ] is a functional of @xmath0 which may be local or non - local in nature , @xmath10 is a viscosity coefficient and @xmath11 is the dimension of the system .",
    "it is easy to see that the model in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hydro_damp ] ) admits an energy @xmath12 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{\\omega } \\rho \\mid { { \\bf u}}\\mid^2 d { { \\bf r}}+ \\mathcal{f}[\\rho],\\ ] ] such that @xmath13 the proof of eq .",
    "( [ energy_derivative ] ) is presented in [ general_energy ] .",
    "the long time equilibrium for the above system corresponds to @xmath14 = 0 , { { \\bf u}}=0 $ ] .",
    "thus the equilibrium properties of the system are determined by the functional @xmath1 $ ] which represents the free energy functional .",
    "the specific functional form of the free energy @xmath1 $ ] determines the theory and the phase diagram of the model .",
    "one must appeal to cdft or a similar approximation for the specific form of the free energy .",
    "it is worth noting that the time dynamics of the system however is much richer than a standard gradient descent model @xcite .",
    "the first set of simulations using this type of model was presented in @xcite .",
    "it was observed that while the total energy @xmath15 $ ] and the free energy @xmath1 $ ] were non - increasing functions of time , the kinetic energy and the individual components of the free energy were not .",
    "however no details about the numerical method were given in @xcite .",
    "here , we present the first energy - stable method to solve such coupled systems .",
    "the physical properties and relevance of the model lies in the free energy functional @xmath1 $ ] used .",
    "a large number of models for the free energy exist in literature .",
    "these models include cdft @xcite derived in the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics , as well as phase field crystal ( pfc ) models @xcite , which are derived using phenomenological theories motivated by cdft .",
    "the energy in cdft is typically a non - local functional of the density while the energy in the pfc is a weakly non - local functional that depends only on gradients of the density .",
    "in addition , in cdft the ideal gas part of the free energy contains a logarithm . in cdft",
    ", the combination of the logarithmic part of the free energy with the nonlocal interaction energy induces much sharper peaks in the density field than the peaks obtained using the pfc model where the logarithmic term is replaced by a polynomial and a gradient approximation is used for the interaction energy ( as described in appendix b ) .",
    "thus , the cdft system requires a finer grid to resolve the dynamics .",
    "these free energy models have been very popular and capture phase transitions at the atomic length scales , but on diffusion time scales , thus enabling the simulation of microstructure evolution at much longer time scales than can be captured using molecular dynamics or other stochastic approaches @xcite .",
    "this makes the hydrodynamic theory considered here an extremely valuable tool in investigating non - equilibrium effects such as the effect of flow on the phase transition . thus developing an efficient and stable numerical method for this class of models",
    "is of critical importance .    in this work",
    "we use the convex splitting framework introduced by eyre @xcite to develop stable numerical schemes .",
    "the convex splitting framework has been successfully applied to the pfc - based models @xcite and to non - local cdft - like models @xcite .",
    "however these approaches consider conserved gradient descent models without hydrodynamics .",
    "the current literature on hydrodynamic models driven by free energy gradients mainly considers incompressible multiphase fluids using the cahn - hilliard free energy ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "we note that in @xcite , the incompressible navier - stokes system was coupled with the pfc model .",
    "a similar approach using a phenomenological pfc - like free energy driven hydrodynamic model was presented in @xcite however no numerical methods were presented . while there has been much work in the literature on the development of numerical methods for compressible fluids driven by van der waals and cahn - hilliard - like free energies , to the best of our knowledge the development of accurate and energy - stable numerical methods for the case of compressible fluids driven by gradients of pfc and cdft free energies , which are higher",
    "order and nonlocal ( cdft ) , has not been addressed .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ section : free_energy ]",
    "we present the description of the model and the associated free energies . in section [ section : cs ]",
    "we present the basic ideas of convex splitting and outline the need for a comprehensive treatment for the various free energy models discussed in this work .",
    "this section also presents the basic energy estimates required to develop an unconditionally energy stable method for the hydrodynamic theory of freezing .",
    "an unconditionally energy stable conservative discretization of time is presented in section [ section : method_semi ] , where the properties of scheme are proven .",
    "the corresponding fully discrete numerical method is presented in section [ section : method_full ] .",
    "finally the numerical results are presented in section [ section : numerical ] , where the properties of the numerical method are explored numerically . in section [ section : conclusion ] , conclusions are drawn and future work is discussed .",
    "details of the model derivation , definitions of the discrete operators , and the nonlinear multigrid method used in the simulations are presented in the appendices .",
    "in the reminder of the paper we will restrict ourselves to 2 dimensions .",
    "however we note that the ideas , numerical methods , theorems and proofs extend to 3 dimensions in a straightforward manner .",
    "we will consider a spatial domain @xmath16 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the results however extend to other boundary conditions such as homogenous dirichlet ( no - slip ) solid wall boundary conditions and neumann boundary conditions ( see [ bc ] ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hydro_damp ] ) are first rewritten in the primitive variable form for convenience as follows : @xmath17 the dissipation tensor @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the identity tensor of rank @xmath21 . in this work",
    "we will consider the following two specific models for the free energy .",
    "classical density functional theory typically relies on a free energy that is a non - local functional of the density @xmath0 .",
    "a typical form for the free energy is given by @xmath22 = \\mathcal{f}_{id } [ \\rho ] + \\mathcal{f}_{ex } [ \\rho ] , \\label{energy_dft}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 : = \\int_{\\omega } \\rho ( \\ln ( \\rho ) - 1 ) d { { \\bf r}},\\ ] ] is the ideal gas part of the free energy ( e.g. , describes mixing ) and @xmath24 : = -\\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{\\omega } \\rho ( j * \\rho ) d { { \\bf r}},\\ ] ] which is the excess free energy functional ( e.g. , describes interactions ) , with @xmath25 the convolution kernel @xmath26 represents different quantities in different approximations of the density functional theory .",
    "for example , in the context of the local density approximation @xmath27 , represents the pairwise inter - atomic potential energy associated with two particles that located at @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively ( see @xcite ) . in the context of the ramakrishnan - yousseff density functional theory the quantity @xmath26 represents the two particle direct correlation function @xcite .",
    "while the convolution kernel has different physical meanings for different physical approximations the form of the excess free energy is consistent across a large class of density functional theories and is worth addressing in general .    for the reminder of this paper",
    "we will assume that the convolution kernel @xmath26 is a sufficiently regular and @xmath30-periodic function such that    * @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are sufficiently regular , @xmath30-periodic and pointwise non - negative .",
    "* @xmath33 and @xmath34 are even , i.e. , @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "* @xmath38 .",
    "it is worth noting that the above assumptions are in general true .",
    "for example , the nontrivial assumption that the kernel is even follows from radial symmetry of the interaction potentials for both the local density approximation and the ramakrishnan - yousseff formalism @xcite .",
    "this free energy satisfies a convex splitting of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are convex functionals defined as :    @xmath42 : = \\int_{\\omega }   \\left\\ { \\rho ( \\ln \\rho -1 ) + ( j_e * 1 ) \\rho^2   \\right\\ } d{{\\bf r}};\\\\ \\displaystyle \\mathcal{f}_{cdft , e } [ \\rho ] : = \\int_{\\omega }   \\left\\ {    \\frac{1}{2 } \\rho ( j * \\rho )   + ( j_e * 1 ) \\rho^2 \\right\\}d { { \\bf r}}. \\end{array } \\label{ddft_cs}\\ ] ]    here we say a functional @xmath1 $ ] is convex in a hilbert space @xmath43 ( consisting of sufficiently regular functions ) if for any @xmath44 that @xmath45 \\geq 0 $ ] for all @xmath46 .",
    "this convex splitting is not unique and other forms of convex splitting can be obtained ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this specific convex splitting is similar to the one proposed in @xcite as it has certain advantages , which will become apparent in the later sections .",
    "it is worth noting that in @xcite the authors considered the case where @xmath47 .",
    "however in cdft @xmath48 is usually negative as assumed here .",
    "for example in the ramakrishnan - youssef @xcite cdft model @xmath49 is related to the isothermal compressibility of the liquid and is negative @xcite .",
    "the phase field crystal ( pfc ) approximation was first proposed by elder et al @xcite . while the pfc was first derived using a phenomenological approach , the pfc has since been re - interpreted as an approximation to dynamic density functional theory ( ddft ) , which is a time - dependent counterpart to cdft @xcite .",
    "typically , pfc formulations use a scaled version of the deviation of the density from a reference density rather than the density field itself ( see [ pfc_derivation ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the density is not always non - negative in pfc models . here",
    ", we use a formulation of the pfc that uses the particle density field directly and maintains its non - negativity .",
    "the pfc energy functional we consider is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a free parameter that determines the strength of interactions between the particles and hence the elastic constants of the solid phase .",
    "we refer the reader to [ pfc_derivation ] for details regarding the relation of the above free energy and more standard formulations of the pfc energy .",
    "we note that this free energy admits a convex splitting of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are convex functional defined as : @xmath56 : = \\int_{\\omega } \\left \\ { \\frac{1}{12 } \\left ( \\rho-\\frac{3}{2 } \\right)^4 + \\frac{\\alpha}{2 } \\left ( \\rho-\\frac{3}{2 } \\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\delta \\rho)^2 \\right \\ } d\\mathbf{r } , \\label{cs_pfc1}\\ ] ] and @xmath57 : = \\int_{\\omega }    \\mid \\nabla \\rho \\mid^2 d\\mathbf{r}. \\label{cs_pfc2}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section we discuss in considerable generality the ideas involved in convex splitting schemes for the class of models described so far . previously , wise et al in @xcite considered a class of local free energies like the pfc model that satisfies the form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] are convex functionals of @xmath0 with a specific functional form . it was assumed that @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] are integrals of energy densities @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",

    "<S> the method is applied to problems using two specific free energy functionals : one local and one non - local functional . </S>",
    "<S> a nonlinear multigrid method is used to solve the numerical method , which is nonlinear at the implicit time step . </S>",
