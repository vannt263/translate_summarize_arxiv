    "circumstellar disks are an inevitable byproduct of the collapse of a molecular core to form a star or collection of stars because of the enormous compression of size scales and the consequent magnification of any slight initial rotation .",
    "these disks funnel material onto the star but they can also form planetary systems .",
    "we now know this not only from our own solar system but the detection of more than one hundred planets around other stars .",
    "to help understand the mechanisms by which planets form , however , requires basic measurements of disk properties such as masses and sizes .",
    "a great deal of work has been carried out in this area of course , including seminal papers by beckwith et al .",
    "( 1990 ) on dust masses derived from millimeter continuum fluxes , and dutrey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) on disk sizes from millimeter interferometry .",
    "needless to say , the bima interferometer has also played a major role in disk studies ( e.g. , looney , mundy , & welch 2000 ) .    here , we present recent work on measurements of basic disk properties in two quite different environments .",
    "stars form mostly singly or in binaries in taurus , but stars in the trapezium cluster in orion are much closer together and bathed in a strong ultraviolet radiation field .",
    "we have used the three submillimeter telescopes on mauna kea for these studies and have found that extending disk observations to submillimeter wavelengths can provide important new information . certainly , here in hawaii , we agree wholeheartedly that one telescope is never enough ! a more formal writeup of this work is available in andrews & williams ( 2005 ) and williams , andrews , & wilner ( 2005 ) .",
    "submillimeter observations probe the cool , outer regions of circumstellar disks where giant planets are expected to form .",
    "such long - wavelength data are required to infer the total masses of disks , and can also be used to study the collisional growth of dust grains into planetesimals via changes in the spectral dependence of the disk opacity .",
    "comparisons of infrared observations with physical models of star - disk systems have led to a sequence of evolutionary stages that occur before the star arrives on the main sequence ( lada & wilking 1984 ; adams & shu 1986 ; adams et al .",
    "1987 ) . in the class i stage",
    ", an extended circumstellar envelope is rapidly dumping material onto a central protostar and a massive disk .",
    "after the envelope is dissipated , the system becomes a class ii object , with a disk that is actively accreting material onto a central , optically visible star . in the final class iii stage , _",
    "at least _ the inner part of the disk has been evacuated , although the dominant mechanism for this process remains in debate ( see hollenbach et al .",
    "the most interesting possibility is that the gas and dust in the disk have agglomerated into larger objects in a developing planetary system .",
    "the disk evolution scheme highlighted above is based on the shape of the infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and therefore focuses on the inner , warmer part of the disk .",
    "a comparable submillimeter survey could therefore reveal information about how disks evolve radially .",
    "a single - dish continuum survey at 350 , 450 , and 850@xmath0 m of more than 150 disks in the taurus star - forming clouds has recently been completed , using both the scuba array on jcmt and the sharc - ii camera on the cso ( andrews & williams 2005 ) .",
    "the primary goal of that program was to take advantage of the stability and efficiency of the scuba instrument to obtain an 850@xmath0 m sample with a relatively uniform flux density limit of @xmath110mjy ( 3 @xmath2 ) , corresponding roughly to a detection threshold of disks with masses greater than that of jupiter ( @xmath3m@xmath4 ) .",
    "compared to previous surveys at 1.3 mm ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; osterloh & beckwith 1995 ) , the submillimeter observations are more sensitive by at least a factor of 5 , and considerably more uniform .    to allow for optical depth effects and a radial temperature distribution in determining a disk mass , a simple disk structural model ( e.g. , adams et al .  1987 ; beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ) was employed in fits to the full sed from the infrared through millimeter .",
    "an empirical calibration of the 850@xmath0 m flux density and the disk mass indicates that assuming optically thin emission at a temperature of @xmath120k is a reasonable means of measuring @xmath5 in the absence of sufficient sed information .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of a sed generated from such a model , with two key regions marked : the mid - infrared and millimeter both are simple power laws in frequency .",
    "the infrared index , @xmath6 , defines the different classes of disk evolution ( greene et al .",
    "1994 ) , and the millimeter index , @xmath7 , constrains the dust grain opacity and thereby the maximum size of the grains ( pollack et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "we were able to obtain short wavelength ( 350 and/or 450@xmath0 m ) fluxes for all class i objects and more than half of the class ii objects that were detected at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "combining with tabulated fluxes at millimeter wavelengths from the literature where possible , we then measured the sed slope over a factor of @xmath8 in wavelength range .",
    "this allowed us to determine @xmath7 more accurately than previous work and study its evolution .",
    "the major results of our survey are summarized in figure 2 .",
    "the mass in millimeter sized grains decreases from median values of @xmath9 for class i to @xmath10 for class ii to @xmath11 for class iii objects .",
    "the empirically measured millimeter spectral index also decreases from a median of 2.5 for class i to 1.8 for class ii objects .",
    "this is the first time that the evolution of basic properties of the outer disk have been quantified and is due to the high sensitivity , large sample size , and extended wavelength coverage of the survey .",
    "the millimeter spectral indices in class i and class ii objects are considerably less than that found in the ism , @xmath12 .",
    "the low values could be caused by high optical depth or a change in the frequency dependence of the dust grain opacity , @xmath13 .",
    "a simple radiative transfer calculation shows , in the rayleigh - jeans limit , @xmath14 for optically thick emission and @xmath15 in the optically thin case .",
    "( a value lower than 2 , as found for class ii objects , may be due to the rayleigh - jeans assumption being invalid for the short wavelength data or additional processes such as significant ionized gas emission at long wavelengths from a jet . )",
    "our disk models , which integrate over the temperature and surface density radial profiles , indicate that no more than @xmath16% of the emission is optically thick at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "we therefore conclude that @xmath17 for disk grains is not only substantially lower than for ism grains ( first noted by beckwith & sargent 1991 ) but that it also decreases as disks evolve from class i to class ii .    further evidence for an evolution of grain properties is shown in figure 3 .",
    "we found an inverse correlation between the infrared and millimeter spectral indices that can seemingly only be explained by a decrease in @xmath17 .",
    "if the grain properties did not change , @xmath7 would depend only on the disk structure .",
    "typically assumed evolutionary scenarios such as viscous spreading or decreasing disk mass would lower the optical depth at all radii and increase @xmath7 , opposite to the observed trend . the empirical decline in millimeter spectral slope , @xmath7 , as disks evolve is due to a flattening of the dust opacity index , @xmath17 , and is most readily explained by an increase in the maximum size of the grains ( pollack et al .",
    "1994 ) , from microns to millimeters .",
    "( see also the paper by david wilner in this volume for evidence of growth to centimeter sizes in tw hya . )",
    "understanding the timescales involved in the evolution of circumstellar disks is critical for placing constraints on the dominant mechanism(s ) of planet formation . in a purely statistical sense , our large , sensitive , and uniform submillimeter survey of taurus disks enables a direct comparison with previous work at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. , kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) to examine the evolutionary timescale as a function of disk radius .",
    "we found , in general agreement with work at other wavelengths ( e.g. , duvert et al .",
    "2000 ) , that only a small fraction of disks , @xmath1810% , that have no inner disk signatures of either infrared excess or h@xmath7 emission were detected in the submillimeter . based on the disk frequency in clusters of different ages , haisch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimate a lifetime for the inner disk of @xmath19myr .",
    "the outer disk must therefore become undectable no later than a few @xmath20yr after the inner disk disappears .",
    "understanding the trigger for this rapid transition remains a key problem in disk evolution .",
    "some possible explanations for the essentially radially independent disk dissipation timescale include viscous accretion with simultaneous photoevaporation by the central star ( e.g. , clarke et al .",
    "2001 ) , rapid grain growth at all radii in the early stages of planet formation ( e.g. , weidenschilling & cuzzi 1993 ) , or ( more speculative but most intriguing ) dynamical clearing by migrating proto - planets .",
    "given that most low mass stars are born in ob associations ( mckee & williams 1997 ) , it is essential to understand their formation in such an environment . as the statistics of extrasolar planetary systems become better understood ( e.g. , marcy , cochran , & mayor 2000 ) , it is also natural to extend this question to the formation of planets around low mass stars in massive star forming regions .",
    "the trapezium cluster in orion is the nearest young , massive star forming region and it is consequently the most intensively studied ( e.g. , odell 2001 ) .",
    "there are approximatly @xmath21 @xmath22  myr old stars in the central 1  pc of the cluster core ( hillenbrand 1997 ) but the radiation field is dominated by one o6 star , @xmath23 ori c. ionized gas from the evaporating envelopes and disks around nearby low mass stars can be observed at centimeter wavelengths with the vla ( churchwell et al .",
    "1987 ) through the optical , most spectacularly with hst ( beginning with odell , wen & hu 1993 ) .",
    "the hst images provide some of the most dramatic images of protostellar disks that exist ( see in particular bally et al .",
    "they were dubbed `` proplyds '' by odell as they were presumed to be protoplanetary on account of their solar system scale sizes .",
    "however their masses  and potential for forming planets  were unknown .",
    "only a lower limit less than a jupiter mass could be obtained by integrating a minimal extinction over their area ( mccaughrean et al .",
    "1998 ) and it was not clear , therefore , that the proplyds had enough mass to form ( giant ) planets .",
    "disk masses are best measured at longer wavelengths where the dust emission becomes optically thin .",
    "interferometry is essential to resolve the tightly clustered proplyds from each other and also to filter out the strong emission from the background molecular cloud .",
    "mundy , looney , & lada ( 1995 ) used the bima interferometer at @xmath24  mm to image a field around @xmath23 ori c containing 33 proplyds .",
    "several significant peaks were found , four coincident with proplyds , but the intensity was consistent with free - free emission from ionized gas and they were unable to measure masses . by analyzing the non - detections , however , they were able to place a statistical upper limit of @xmath25 on the average disk mass .",
    "the dust emission increases at shorter wavelengths and the free - free emission decreases . using the ovro array , bally et al .",
    "( 1998b ) imaged two fields containing a total of six proplyds at @xmath26  mm , made a tentative detection of one object with a mass equal to @xmath27 , and placed upper limits of @xmath28 on the other objects .",
    "lada ( 1999 ) presented a mosaic of two fields at @xmath26  mm with the plateau de bure interferometer that claimed three detections .",
    "the implied masses were @xmath29 but these have not been analyzed in detail .    by operating at shorter wavelengths than the other interferometers , the submillimeter array ( sma ; ho et al .",
    "2004 ) is better suited to measuring the dust emission above the strong bremsstrahlung emission from the ionized gas .",
    "furthermore , it has a relatively large field of view which allows many proplyds to be imaged simultaneously .",
    "details of the observations and their analysis are in williams , andrews , & wilner ( 2005 ) .",
    "we observed a single field toward the center of the trapezium cluster at 340  ghz ( @xmath30 m ) .",
    "23 proplyds were contained within the @xmath31 full width half maximum primary beam .",
    "the resolution of these compact configuration data was @xmath32 and the rms noise level was @xmath33  mjy  beam@xmath34 .",
    "contours of the continuum emission are shown in figure  4 .",
    "five proplyds were detected within the @xmath31 fwhm of the primary beam with a peak flux greater than @xmath35  mjy  beam@xmath34 and are labeled in the figure .",
    "167317 ( @xmath23orig ) is a very bright source in the optical and radio .",
    "based on an extrapolation of its sed at centimeter wavelengths ( garay , moran , & reid 1987 ) , we appear to be detecting the bremsstrahlung emission from its ionized cocoon even at these short wavelengths .",
    "the four other proplyds have fluxes that are significantly above the bremsstrahlung extrapolation and we attribute the bulk of the sma flux to thermal dust emission .    the corresponding disk masses for these four proplyds , after correcting for a contribution from ionized gas , range from 1.3 to @xmath36 .",
    "these are similar to the minimum mass solar nebula ( weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "photo - evaporative mass loss rates are high , @xmath37  yr@xmath34 ( churchwell et al . 1987 ) , but concentrated in the outer parts of the disks where the gravitational potential of the central star is weakest and photoevaporation is most effective ( hollenbach et al .",
    "the radius of the bound inner region depends on the stellar mass and whether the gas is ionized by euv photons or remains neutral and only heated by the fuv radiation field .",
    "the detected proplyds lie far enough away from @xmath23 ori c for the second condition to apply and the central @xmath38  au radius of the disks survive ( johnstone et al .",
    "disk radii , measured from the hst observations , are @xmath39  au for the detections so , at most , only the outer 50% of the disk will be lost . for a surface density @xmath40 ,",
    "the surviving mass fraction is at least 60% . in these systems",
    "at least , the submillimeter emission indicates there is sufficient material bound to the star to form solar system scale planetary systems .",
    "there are intriguing possibilities for the non - detections too .",
    "we found a statistically positive flux toward the 18 proplyds that lay below our @xmath41 detection limit .",
    "the corresponding ( gas + dust ) mass limit is @xmath42 and the dust - only mass limit is therefore @xmath43 .",
    "that is , even if all the gas were lost from these disks , there would still be enough material to form terrestrial - like planets .",
    "far more sensitive observations would be required to verify this on an individual basis , of course , and it would also be important to average the vla data in a similar way to measure the low level bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "jpw thanks the organizers for their invitation to this celebration of jack s extraordinary career .",
    "as this meeting showed , jack s management of the radio astronomy lab allowed many students in many different areas to flourish .",
    "i consider myself very fortunate to have been part of his group and to have benefited from his work and his guidance .",
