    "the year 2000 has been quite interesting and remarkable for heavy ion physicists searching for a new form of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in the beginning of the year",
    ", cern has announced that there is definite evidence of possible qgp signals from the experiments performed at the sps @xcite .",
    "this declaration was made after scrutinizing results from all the dedicated experiments which have been taking data since 1994 using the pb beams at 158 gev / nucleon ( a total energy of 33 tev ) . in the middle of the year , this field entered a new era with the commissioning of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl which is a captive machine for qgp search .",
    "soon after , new results from the collisions at rhic have started to appear @xcite . at this time , it is most appropriate to review one of the basic observables of the nuclear collisions , that is the particle multiplicity distributions .",
    "one of the distinct advantages of the heavy ion collisions at such high energies is the production of large number of particles in every event .",
    "this allows for a detailed study of event - by - event fluctuations in particle multiplicities and ratios of identified particles .",
    "this is important for understanding the evolution of nuclear system at high energy collisions .",
    "formation of disoriented chiral condesates ( dcc ) , which is a direct consequence of chiral symmetry restoration , would also give rise to event - by - event correlated fluctuations in charged particles to neutrals .",
    "in this manuscript we discuss these topics in view of the data from the wa98 experiment at the cern - sps .    for a thermalized system undergoing a phase transition ,",
    "the variation of the temperature with entropy density is interesting as the temperature is expected to increase below the transition , remain constant during the transition , and then increase again @xcite .",
    "this can be studied by measuring the mean transverse momentum , @xmath23 , and particle multiplicities for varying centrality , for a number of colliding systems at different energies .",
    "since multiplicity of produced particles is an important quantity to characterize the evolving system , its fluctuation from event to event may provide a distinct signal of the phase transition from hadronic gas to qgp phase .",
    "recently , several new methods using event - by - event fluctuations of @xmath23 and particle multiplicities have been proposed to probe into the mechanism of phase transition @xcite .",
    "another interesting phenomenon is the formation of domains of dcc @xcite which gives rise to isospin fluctuation , in which the neutral pion fraction can deviate significantly from 1/3 , the value for uncorrelated emission of pions .",
    "several methods have been proposed to search for signals of dcc @xcite .",
    "the most direct signal comes from the event - by - event fluctuations in the number of charged particles to photons in localized ( @xmath24-@xmath25 ) phase space .",
    "the observed fluctuations will have contributions from statistical fluctuations and those which have dynamical origin .",
    "the contribution from dynamical origin comprise of ( a ) fluctuations which do not change event - by - event , e.g. , those from bose - einstein ( be ) correlations , resonance decays and ( b ) the fluctuations which have new physics origin and may vary from event - to - event .",
    "the major interest for us would be to probe into the fluctuations which have new physics origin , such as those arising near the tricritical point of qcd phase diagram and the formation of dcc . to extract the dynamical part from the observed fluctuations",
    ", one has to understand the contributions from statistical and other known sources .",
    "it is possible to probe at the non - statistical fluctuations from experimental data in a model independent way by comparing these with mixed events generated from the data .",
    "once properly understood , mixed events provide the best means to infer about the presence of non - statistical fluctuations .",
