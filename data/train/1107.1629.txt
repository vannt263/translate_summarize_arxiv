    "although supersymmetry has not yet been discovered in nature , it plays a crucial role in various approaches to unified theories .",
    "it is thus very natural to try to find a constructively well defined formulation of supersymmetric theories working even in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "a lattice formulation could be a good candidate . on the other hand it seems that the lattice regularization and supersymmetry does not get along with each other@xcite .",
    "realization of exact lattice supersymmetry with a finite lattice spacing has been a long standing problem since the first attempt of lattice supersymmetry@xcite .",
    "it has never been realized in a satisfactory way .",
    "the lattice chiral fermion problem was also a longstanding problem but it is considered that a satisfactory understanding was reached at least for lattice",
    "it is , however , not obvious that these two fundamental questions on the lattice are not related .",
    "we consider that these two problems are related in a fundamental way .",
    "there are two major difficulties for constructing a formulation of exact supersymmetry on the lattice .",
    "firstly the difference operator which plays the role of differential operator on the lattice does not satisfy the leibnitz rule@xcite .",
    "a typical form of a lattice supersymmetry algebra would have the form : anti - commutator of two super charges is equal to a difference operator .",
    "however a supercharge operation on a product of fields should satisfy leibnitz rule while the difference operator does not satisfy the leibnitz rule and thus there appears an algebraic inconsistency already at the leading order of lattice constant level . secondly there is the notorious chiral fermion problem .",
    "if we naively put massless fermions on a lattice , species doublers appear and an unbalance between the number of fermions and bosons is generated .",
    "thus supersymmetry breaking is generated from different breaking source .",
    "this doubling of the chiral fermion problem could , however , be avoided if we adopt other fermion formulation with recently developed chiral fermion approach@xcite .",
    "there appear , however , other problems due to the non - equal footing treatment of bosons and fermions@xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose a formulation to solve the above two difficulties .    as for the first difficulty it has been recognized in recent years that the reason why we can not construct exact lattice supersymmetry models is not because it is simply difficult but it is in fact impossible if we introduce the difference operator in the lattice supersymmetry algebra and keep strictly the locality and translational invariance on the lattice@xcite .",
    "if we give up some of the presumed characteristics such as locality , translational invariance , commutativity , ... then we can find some supersymmetric lattice formulations which were claimed to be exactly supersymmetric on the lattice@xcite .",
    "we consider that there are three possibilities for exact lattice supersymmetry formulations with a lattice derivative ; + ( 1 ) keeping a local lattice derivative like difference operator but losing translational invariance on the lattice , ( 2 ) keeping finite translational invariance exact but using non - local lattice derivative like slac derivative@xcite , ( 3 ) keeping the difference operator as lattice derivative operator but introducing non - commutativity between fields , turning the algebraic structure into a hopf algebra .",
    "the first possibility ( 1 ) was suggested by dondi and nicolai@xcite with a lattice version of sine momentum conservation . a possible realization of this idea was later developed in the coordinate space@xcite . as a result",
    "it is equivalent to introduce a delta function of lattice momentum , leading to nonlocal interactions@xcite .",
    "it has been recognized by many authors that the second possibility ( 2 ) may be the only possibility if we strictly keep the lattice translational invariance@xcite .",
    "it is , however , well known that the slac type derivative is highly nonlocal and may cause various problems . in particular anomaly will not be generated properly when gauge fields are turned on@xcite , suggesting a fundamental connection with the chiral fermion issue .",
    "an alternative analysis by a consistency condition of block spin transformation for supersymmetric lattice models led also to a statement that the only consistent lattice derivative is the slac derivative@xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that both approaches ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) include nonlocal interactions .",
    "there was a proposal of exact supersymmetry without nonlocality but with the introduction of infinite flavors@xcite .",
    "our link approach formulation  @xcite of lattice supersymmetry falls into the case ( 3 ) . according to the breakdown of the leibnitz rule for the difference operator we introduced similar breaking pattern of leibnitz rule for super charges and imposed algebraic consistency .",
    "we then claimed that the exact lattice supersymmetry is realized .",
    "it was , however , pointed out that the formulation contains an ordering ambiguity for the products of fields@xcite .",
    "it was later recognized that the problems caused by the ordering ambiguity can be solved by introducing a noncommutativity for fields carrying a shift .",
    "then it was claimed that the models of link approach are exactly supersymmetric under a hopf algebraic symmetry where the difference operator can be treated as derivative operator and the noncommutativity of fields naturally fits within the scheme of a hopf algebra@xcite . in the case of gauge theory ,",
    "the problem of gauge invariance was questioned and remained to be understood .",
    "we have so far considered the cases where the supersymmetry algebra includes a lattice differential operator .",
    "if a lattice differential operator is not included as part of the exact lattice supersymmetry formulation , then the above arguments do not apply .",
    "in fact exact lattice supersymmetry has been realized in some special case of nilpotent super charge @xmath2 which is a part of an extended supersymmetry algebra@xcite in a twisted supersymmetry formulation@xcite .",
    "the exactness of the nilpotent super charges of an extended supersymmetry greatly helps the lattice models to converge into supersymmetric continuum theories in lower dimensions@xcite , it is , however , expected that fine tunings related to other super charges may be difficult for higher dimensional models with extended supersymmetry .    in our previous paper @xcite , denoted in the following as paper i , we proposed a new formulation which has @xmath0 exact lattice supersymmetry in one dimension .",
    "our formulation , however , falls into the case ( 1 ) for the first difficulty in the above classification .",
    "we introduced a lattice version of sine momentum conservation which led to nonlocal interactions and a mild loss of translational invariance .",
    "in paper i we solved the second difficulty of species doubler problem of chiral fermions by identifying the species doublers of a chiral fermion with members of its same supermultiplet of the @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "the species doublers of chiral fermions are physical particles and thus chiral fermion problem does not exist in this formulation .",
    "we conjectured a possibility that the approach ( 1 ) of paper i and the link approach ( 3 ) are essentially equivalent .    in this paper",
    "we extend the previously developed formulation of paper i to the @xmath0 wess - zumino model in two dimensions .",
    "in particular we develop a systematic treatment of chiral super fields algebraically and find chiral conditions on the lattice .",
    "previously in paper i we found the supersymmetric action heuristically , while here we provide a formulation for deriving the action as a @xmath3-exact quantity within the lattice version of chiral superfield formalism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first explain the basic concept of lattice supersymmetry in our formulation for the simplest model in section 2 .",
    "in section 3 we re - derive the action of one dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric model which was heuristically derived in paper i. superderivatives are consistently introduced on the lattice and the basic algebraic structure of lattice chiral superfield formulation are presented for the one dimensional model . in section 4 two dimensional full treatment of the @xmath0 lattice supersymmetry algebra is given .",
    "the chiral conditions of the lattice supersymmetry algebra are derived . in section 5 the wess - zumino action for @xmath1",
    "is derived in terms of lattice fields belonging to irreducible chiral and antichiral representations . in section 6",
    "we introduce a new type of star product in the coordinate representation on which the difference operator satisfy the leibnitz rule .",
    "we then express the non local action in the coordinate space in terms of the star product .",
    "the section 7 includes conclusions and discussions . in the appendix we provide an analysis of the recovery of translational invariance in the continuum limit .",
    "the simplest supersymmetry algebra in one dimension is given it terms of a single supercharge @xmath3 satisfying the following relation : q^2 =  i [ susyalg ]  , where @xmath4 can be considered as the momentum generator .",
    "the lattice counterpart of this algebra is obtained by replacing the differential operator with a difference operator q^2 =  i ^(s ) [ latsusyalg ]  , where we introduce the symmetric difference operator : @xmath5 : ^(s)(x ) =  \\{(x+)- ( x- ) } [ symdiffop ]  , where @xmath6 is the fundamental lattice constant .    since @xmath7 can be considered as the generator of a translation of the lattice distance @xmath6 , it is natural to expect that the super charge @xmath3 may be identified as a half lattice translation generator .",
    "it is thus very natural to introduce half lattice sites to accommodate the half lattice translation . in our previous papers we stressed that the importance of the half lattice structure in the lattice supersymmetry transformation can be well understood by the matrix formulation of the super coordinates and charges  @xcite .",
    "furthermore it was recognized that in the @xmath8 supersymmetry an alternating sign structure @xmath9 on the half lattice is associated to the fermionic states .",
    "one can then write a lattice `` superfield '' symbolically as ( x ) = ( x ) + ( -1)^ ( x ) [ lattsup ] , where we have introduced a factor @xmath10 and @xmath11 for convenience . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , grassman even and odd fields .",
    "since we identify the super charge operation as a half lattice symmetric difference operation , one is led to introduce lattice sites at integer multiples of @xmath14 .",
    "then the expression ( [ lattsup ] ) actually means : ( x ) = \\ {    lc & ( x )   x = n a/2 , + & a^1/2 e^ ( x )  x=(2n+1)a/4 .    .",
    "[ spf ] the supersymmetry transformations can be identified as a half lattice @xmath15 shift transformation of the superfield @xmath16 : _ ( x ) = a^-1/2 e^ , [ st ] where @xmath17 is a grassman odd super parameter accompanying an alternating sign . by separating @xmath16 into its component fields according to ( [ spf ] )",
    "we find : & & _ ( x ) = i ( x ) , [ suslattf1 ] + & & _ ( x ) = 2 a^-1 , [ suslattf2 ] where @xmath18 is an even multiple of @xmath19 in ( [ suslattf1 ] ) and an odd one in ( [ suslattf2 ] ) .",
    "it is rather surprising that the half lattice translation together with alternating sign structure for the lattice superfields generates a correct lattice supersymmetry transformation in the coordinate space .",
    "the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations ( [ st ] ) leads to a translation of the lattice constant @xmath6 generated by the symmetric difference operator @xmath5 given in eq.([symdiffop ] ) , thus realizing the lattice supersymmetry algebra ( [ latsusyalg ] ) : _ _ ( x ) - _ _ ( x ) = 2q^2 ( x ) = e^ .",
    "[ trs1 ] the exponential phase factor @xmath20 is @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "the same algebraic relation ( [ trs1 ] ) , but without the phase factor @xmath20 , works separately also for the component fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in the coordinate space representation",
    "the alternating sign structure plays a crucial role in reproducing the correct lattice supersymmetry transformation and in interchanging the role of the fermion and of the boson .",
    "let us consider the meaning of the alternating sign structure in the momentum space representation .",
    "we define the fourier transform of the fermionic component field as ( p ) = _",
    "x= + e^ipx ( x ) = - ( p ) , [ fourier - psi ] which has anti - periodicity with respect to a momentum shift of @xmath25 , since fermions are located on the quarter lattice sites .",
    "let us consider now the fermion field with an accompanying alternating sign . in the momentum space representation",
    "it becomes : _",
    "x= + e^ipx(-1)^(x ) = ( p+ ) = - ( p- ) .",
    "the alternating sign of the half lattice structure corresponds in momentum space to a shift of @xmath26 in the momentum .",
    "so the fermion field with an accompanying alternating sign structure in the coordinate space may be associated to a species doubler field .    in a naive lattice formulation of chiral fermions",
    "it is known that the species doublers appear as independent fields so that the number of degrees of freedom of the fermions is increased and the matching of the degrees of freedom between bosons and fermions may be lost .",
    "however in our lattice formulation it is natural to introduce bosonic counter parts of species doublers as well , thus restoring the balance between bosons and fermions .",
    "in fact , since the lattice spacing for each component field is @xmath15 ( with a relative shift of @xmath14 between the boson and the fermion field ) , but translational invariance is associated to shift of the lattice spacing @xmath6 , for each field on the lattice there are two translational invariant configurations , namely : _",
    "1(x ) = c_1 ,  _",
    "2(x ) = ( -1)^n c_2 , [ const - states ] where @xmath27 , @xmath22 for @xmath28 and @xmath24 for @xmath29 .",
    "these two configurations , being translational invariant , should have zero momentum in the continuum limit but on the lattice they have respectively momentum @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "fluctuations around @xmath32 and @xmath33 describe distinct degrees of freedom , which in the case of fermions can be described as the field and its doubler .",
    "so , although we started from an @xmath34 supersymmetry we end up with enough degrees of freedom ( including the doublers in the count ) to accommodate an @xmath0 supersymmetry .",
    "this was accomplished in ref  @xcite , and will be reviewed in the next section .",
    "to summarize , the basic lattice supersymmetry structure as it emerges from the present discussion is : + _ the lattice supersymmetry transformation is a half lattice translation which mixes in general fields and doubler - fields , namely smooth fields on the @xmath15 lattice and fields with an alternating sign structure .",
    "the fermion doubling problem is solved as doublers and original fields alike are members of the same extended supersymmetry multiplet . _ +",
    "in this section we shall give a derivation of the lattice action invariant under the @xmath0 supersymmetry in @xmath35 dimension .",
    "this action was found in our previous paper @xcite in a more heuristic way .",
    "we shall also derive the lattice version of chiral conditions which play an important part in the derivation of the action .",
    "this formulation will be extended to the two dimensional @xmath0 wess - zumino model in the following sections .",
    "there are two supercharges in the @xmath0 model , whose algebra is given as follows : q_1 ^ 2 = q_2 ^ 2 = i ,  \\{q_1,q_2 } = 0 , [ 1d - n2-alg ] which shows that there are two uncorrelated @xmath36 algebras of the type ( [ susyalg ] ) .",

    "[ q1b - f ] we assume here that @xmath16 and @xmath38 are dimensionless , so that no dependence on the lattice spacing @xmath6 appears at the r.h.s . of ( [ q1b - f ] ) .",

    "as discussed in section 5 it also allows the chiral and antichiral fields to be hermitian conjugate ( see eq .",
    "( [ herm ] ) ) and at the same time periodic in @xmath161 .",
    "in this appendix , we show that the translational invariance of @xmath69-point correlation function is recovered in the continuum limit .",
    "let us denote the component fields as @xmath252 .",
    "because of the sine momentum conservation law correlation functions are invariant under the following transformation : @xmath253 with finite length @xmath254 , whereas an invariance under finite translation should be the invariance under the transformation : @xmath255 under transformation ( [ eq : sine - translation ] ) @xmath69-point correlation function transforms as @xmath256    \\\\ & \\langle \\phi_{a_1}(p_{1 + } , p_{1- } )     \\phi_{a_2}(p_{2 + } , p_{2-})\\cdots \\phi_{a_n}(p_{n+ } , p_{n- } )   \\rangle , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that if the correlation function is less divergent than @xmath257 the translational invariance is recovered in the continuum limit .",
    "after rescaling the fields and couplings having dimensions , the interaction terms do not contain any divergences .",
    "the quadratic terms , i.e. , the kinetic term and mass term are given by @xmath258,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leading to the following propagators and ultraviolet behaviors : @xmath259 where @xmath260 consider now an amputated diagram with @xmath261 internal @xmath262 lines , @xmath263 internal @xmath264 and @xmath265 lines , and @xmath266 vertexes . taking into account @xmath257 from each of loop momentum integrations , and @xmath202 from momentum conservation at each vertexes which reduces number of integrations ( except for the total momentum conservation of external lines ) , we obtain @xmath267 the number of vertexes @xmath266 is decomposed into two parts , @xmath268 , one is a number of bosonic vertexes @xmath269 and the other is that of fermionic vertexes @xmath270 . they satisfy the following relations : @xmath271 where @xmath272 is number of internal fermion lines of @xmath273 and @xmath274 , and @xmath275 and @xmath276 are number of external @xmath277 and fermions . combining above relations , we obtain @xmath278 the most divergent case would be @xmath279 which gives @xmath257 .",
    "we can not make , however , a loop in this case . therefore the uv divergence is less than @xmath257 and thus the translational invariance is recovered in the continuum limit .",
