    "recently , the color confinement scenario in coulomb gauge has been revealing its importance @xcite .",

    "the instantaneous color - coulomb potential plays an essential role in the coulomb gauge confinement scenario . in the @xmath1 numerical simulation carried out by cucchieri and zwanziger @xcite",
    ", it was found that the instantaneous color - coulomb potential @xmath4 is strongly enhanced at @xmath5 . moreover , zwanziger pointed out that there exists the inequality@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 means the physical heavy quark potential and @xmath8 the coulomb heavy quark potential corresponding to the instantaneous part of @xmath9 .",
    "this inequality indicates that if the physical heavy quark potential is confining , then the coulomb heavy quark potential is also confining . furthermore , in @xmath1 lattice simulations greensite et al .",
    "found that the coulomb heavy quark potential grows linearly at large quark separations @xcite .",

    "the coulomb gauge fixing does _ not _ fix a gauge completely since it leaves the temporal - gauge field free ; i.e. , one may consider that coulomb gauge has a remnant residual symmetry in the temporal direction .",
    "marinari et al .",
    "@xcite conjectured that the coulomb remnant symmetry breaking may result in a new order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition . recently",
    ", @xmath1 gauge - higgs theory was investigated numerically from this point of view @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the heavy quark potential in the color - singlet channel nonperturbatively , using quenched @xmath0 lattice qcd simulations with the ppl correlator in coulomb gauge .",
    "we first investigate the behavior of the coulomb heavy quark potential in the confinement and deconfinement phases .",
    "the most interesting point is whether the coulomb heavy quark potential has a linearly rising feature at large quark separations .",
    "we confirm the consistency between the coulomb heavy quark potential and the usual wilson loop potential ( or the polyakov line potential ) .",
    "we repeat the same calculation in lorentz gauge , and compare the results obtained in the two cases .",
    "we examine the coulomb remnant symmetry breaking at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly present definitions of the ppl correlators and the coulomb heavy quark potential in the color - singlet channel .",
    "we next summarize the gauge fixing methods and the order parameter for the coulomb remnant symmetry . in section iii ,",
    "the numerical results are shown .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "in this section , we introduce the coulomb potential in the singlet channel between two static heavy quarks and describe how to fix a gauge on the lattice and the order parameter for the coulomb remnant symmetry .",
    "partial length polyakov lines ( ppl ) are defined as @xcite @xmath10 here @xmath11 is an @xmath0 link variable in the temporal direction and @xmath12 , @xmath3 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the lattice cutoff , the gauge coupling , the time component of the gauge potential and the temporal lattice size .",

    "@xmath26 further corresponds to a physical potential , @xmath27 , which can usually be regarded as the wilson loop potential in the same limit .",
    "in addition , these two potentials satisfy zwanziger s inequality , eq .",
    "( [ zwanzigerineq ] ) @xcite ; i.e. , if color confinement exists , then the color - coulomb potential is also confining .",
    "we use the coulomb gauge realized on the lattice as @xmath28 by repeating the gauge rotations @xmath29 where as the gauge rotation matrix , and the parameter @xmath30 is chosen suitably , depending on the lattice size , etc . ]",
    "@xmath31 @xmath32 is a gauge rotation matrix and @xmath33 are spatial lattice link variables .",
    "thus , each lattice configuration can be gauge fixed iteratively @xcite .",
    "the temporal gauge fields possess gauge freedom even after the coulomb gauge fixed .",
    "one can still perform a time dependent gauge rotation on the coulomb gauge fixed links : @xmath34 it was conjectured by marinari et al .",
    "@xcite that this remnant symmetry in coulomb gauge is closely related to color confinement physics .",

    "this quantity contains @xmath41 consequently , if @xmath42 increases linearly for large @xmath43 , i.e. , it is a confining potential , then @xmath44 as @xmath45 , and if @xmath46 as @xmath47 , then @xmath48 .",
    "hence , we may consider that @xmath39 is an order parameter of the confinement and deconfinement phase transitions .",
    "if this is the case , it would be a very desirable order parameter because this works also for the full qcd including dynamical quarks .",
    "in this study , we carried out @xmath0 lattice gauge simulations in the quench approximation to calculate the ppl correlators in the color - singlet channel .",
    "the lattice configurations were generated by the heat - bath monte carlo technique with a plaquette wilson gauge action , and we adopted the iterative method @xcite for fixing a gauge .",

    "( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ) , except that the indices of the link variables are taken as @xmath55 . ]",
    "we carry out the same calculation in lorentz gauge .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "this calculation was performed on the @xmath56 lattice at @xmath53 , and 100 configurations measured every 100 steps are used .",
    "the potential @xmath20 in lorentz gauge represents completely different behavior compared with the case of the coulomb gauge .",
    "it is flat even at large distances . moreover , as @xmath57 increases , the lorentz heavy quark potential tends to approach the usual wilson loop potential from below , but at large distances , the lorentz heavy quark potential seems not to be confining .",
    "this strongly suggests that the color confinement mechanism is very different between coulomb and lorentz gauges .",
    "we have nonperturbatively studied the long - range behavior of the coulomb heavy quark potential defined by the partial - length polyakov line correlators in quenched @xmath0 lattice gauge simulations .",
    "we confirmed numerically that the coulomb heavy quark potential , corresponding to the color - coulomb instantaneous part of the time - time gluon propagator , is confining , as suggested in the coulomb confinement scenario @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 results obtained in this study are qualitatively consistent with those obtained in the @xmath1 analysis carried out by greensite et al .",
    "it is significant that we treated the instantaneous part nonperturbatively in the numerical simulations .",
    "the coulomb heavy quark potential @xmath20 in the confinement phase rises linearly at large distances .",
    "its string tension is several times larger than that obtained from the usual wilson loop potential . as the temporal extension , @xmath57 , of the ppl correlator , increases , the coulomb heavy quark potential asymptotically approaches the usual wilson loop potential . in these simulations ,",
    "complete agreement is not confirmed .",
    "note that consistency was found in the @xmath1 lattice gauge simulation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the result that the @xmath0 coulomb heavy quark potential indicates a stronger confining property can be understood from the relation @xmath58@xcite .",
    "the coulomb string tension can also be estimated from lattice calculations of gluon propagators in coulomb gauge .",
    "it is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite that the coulomb string tension @xmath59 .",
    "however , in the extensive lattice study of langfeld and moyaerts @xcite , the authors concluded that the result @xmath60 can not be ruled out .",
    "this observation is consistent with results derived in @xmath1 and @xmath0 lattice calculations with the ppl correlator .    in @xmath1 lattice simulations",
    "@xcite , @xmath61 dependence of the coulomb string tension scales as a two - loop @xmath61 function .",
    "the coulomb string tension measured here depends on the qcd coupling @xmath62 .",
    "this @xmath61 dependence is not explicable here , and it is therefore desirable to verify it with numerical simulations in higher @xmath61 regions .",
    "the coulomb heavy quark potential @xmath20 in the deconfinement phase at @xmath63 , also increases linearly with @xmath64 at large distances ; i.e. , it is not screened . however , the coulomb heavy quark potential with the finite temporal length in coulomb gauge is sufficiently screened , and finally it becomes comparable to the screened potentials obtained from the full temporal length polyakov line correlator . this result",
    "may be explained in the coulomb confinement scenario @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 corresponds to the instantaneous part , @xmath23 , and therefore @xmath8 does not depend on the time ( temperature ) , whereas the non - instantaneous vacuum polarization term causes the time ( temperature ) dependent contribution .",
    "we have also investigated the behavior of an order parameter related to the remnant symmetry in coulomb gauge . as the lattice volume approaches infinity , the order parameter @xmath65 vanishes in both the confinement and deconfinement phases .",
    "thus , this order parameter is not a good parameter for understanding confinement physics , at least in pure @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "this feature is a consequence of the fact that the coulomb heavy quark potential is always confining in the confinement and deconfinement phases .",
    "the coulomb gauge plays an essential role in the confinement scenario discussed in ref .",
    "we carried out the same calculation for the lorentz gauge and found that the behavior of the lorentz heavy quark potential is completely different from the case of coulomb gauge . in lorentz gauge",
    ", a different confinement scenario should be called for .    the color - coulomb instantaneous part of the time - time gluon propagator exhibits color confinement . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , this expectation may be satisfied in a dynamical - quark lattice simulation .",
    "the vacuum polarization causes a quark - pair creation at large quark separations , i.e. `` string breaking '' , whereas the coulomb linear - rise potential also exists in that case . if one nonperturbatively extracts the contribution of the vacuum polarization , it may be easier to see the string breaking .",
    "the color - coulomb instantaneous part , @xmath23 or @xmath20 on the fixed - time slice , shows the strong linear - rise behavior in @xmath1 and @xmath0 gauge theories at zero and finite temperatures ; this phenomenon is as expected in view of the coulomb confinement scenario @xcite . in terms of the faddeev - popov ( fp ) operator @xmath66 , @xmath8",
    "is given by @xmath67 , which has time - independent and long - range properties .",
    "according to the gribov picture , gauge configurations for which the eigenvalues of the fp operator are small , i.e. , regions near the gribov horizon , play an important role in the confinement dynamics @xcite .",
    "greensite et al",
    ". investigated eigenvalue distributions of the fp operator using the @xmath1 lattice gauge simulation @xcite .    here",
    "we concentrate on the coulomb gauge",
    ". it would be interesting to study how the picture changes when we employ the other gauge by interpolating two gauges , such as @xmath68@xcite .    in this study",
    ", we use the gauge rotation , @xmath69 , which is used in the stochastic gauge fixing@xcite .",
    "this fixing term is  attractive \" in the gribov region and  repulsive \" if one eigenvalue of the faddeev - popov operator is negative , and therefore the effect of gribov copy may not be so serious . nevertheless , it is important to study this point .",
    "we investigated the behavior of the color - singlet @xmath70 potential in the present calculation .",
    "however , an extensive numerical study of the color - dependent forces between two quarks may be necessary to understand multiquark hadrons . in coulomb gauge , @xmath0 color - dependent potentials have also been calculated in lattice gauge simulations@xcite .",
    "it is interesting from a phenomenological point of view that the linearly rising behavior of the coulomb potential exists even in the deconfinement phase at finite temperature .",
    "therefore , a higher temperature simulation is indispensable and it may help to elucidate the behavior of the complex quark - gluon plasma system .",
