    "since its discovery in 1986 , high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates has been a central topic of study in condensed matter physics .",
    "it is now widely believed that cooper pair formation is essential for the superconducting condensate in these systems .",
    "however , the nature of the mediator ( or glue ) responsible for cooper pairing remains hotly debated .",
    "although the interaction of electrons with lattice vibrations is not likely to solely account for the essential properties of high-@xmath1 superconductors ( htscs ) , many probes including angle - resolved photoemission ,  @xcite inelastic neutron scattering ,  @xcite , tunneling  @xcite and raman  @xcite spectroscopies have revealed that electron - phonon interactions have significant effects on various properties .",
    "complementary to the time - integrated techniques , different ultrafast pump - probe techniques  @xcite have been used to disentangle microscopic interactions in htscs .",
    "these techniques aim to study the recombination of photoexcited quasiparticles and the resulting recovery of the superconducting condensate . in htscs , time - resolved ( tr ) angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite and",
    "tr optical reflectivity  @xcite have indicated that the excited quasiparticles preferentially couple to a small number of phonon subsets before decaying through anharmonic coupling to all other lattice vibrations , in support of the notion that selective optical phonon modes give rise to anisotropy of the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) coupling .",
    "@xcite in addition , this anisotropy has also been observed in tr electron diffraction ,  @xcite while resonant femtosecond study of both electronic and phononic degrees of freedom suggests strong el - ph coupling .",
    "@xcite    despite considerable progress in pump - probe experimental studies , work on microscopic modeling of the influence of el - ph interactions on observables , such as the time - dependent optical conductivity or raman spectra , is very limited .",
    "understanding the non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum many - body systems has , in fact , posed a theoretical challenge .",
    "historically , theoretical attempts to model the time evolution of properties have either used quasi - equilibrium models such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 models  @xcite to describe non - equilibrium excitations created by a pump pulse  @xcite or rate equation approaches based on the phenomenological rothwarf - taylor model  @xcite to describe the recovery dynamics of the superconducting state .",
    "recently , the time evolution of the optical conductivity has been studied within a microscopic model that treats the excitation and relaxation dynamics on the same footing .",
    "@xcite all these theories are suitable for pump - probe experiments with low excitation fluence , where the superconducting condensate is merely perturbed but not destroyed .",
    "a picture of the dynamics of quasiparticles and the superconducting condensate in the photo - induced phase transition regime ,  @xcite which is impulsively driven by a high excitation fluence , has as yet been beyond reach .    here",
    "we formulate a theory for the tr optical conductivity and tr raman scattering in htscs in the regime of intermediate to high intensity of pump fluence .",
    "the theory is aimed to address directly the situation where the superconducting condensate can be destroyed by pump pulse .",
    "it is based on an effective temperature model for different subsystems contributing to the response : electrons , hot phonons ( i.e. , out - of - plane out - of - phase o buckling @xmath0 phonons and half - breathing in - plane cu - o bond stretching phonons ) that are strongly coupled to electrons , and the cold lattice .",
    "the model phenomenologically includes the effect of the pump pulse but addresses in greater depth the electron - hot phonon coupling based on a microscopic model hamiltonian for @xmath4-wave superconductivity in htscs .",
    "this microscopic treatment goes beyond previous effective models for the normal state ,  @xcite allowing us to describe the quasiparticle dynamics in both the normal and superconducting states with the same approach . within this unified model",
    ", the time evolution of the whole set of experimental measurables can be calculated in a streamlined way .",
    "our first test of this approach considered the @xmath0 phonons as the only hot phonon mode in the calculation of the tr spectral function for a very high pump fluence .",
    "@xcite in the present work , we include the half - breathing phonons as a second hot phonon mode in the calculation of the tr optical spectroscopy .",
    "importantly , the influence of excitation density on quasiparticle dynamics in htscs is also investigated .",
    "our calculations show that , in the superconducting state , in addition to the peak in the optical conductivity and raman spectra due to the drude response , there is another peak at higher frequencies .",
    "this high frequency peak disappears when the system evolves into the normal state , but recurs if the superconducting condensate is recovered , suggesting the significance of the superconducting gap in the tr optical properties .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : temp ] , we lay down the effective - temperature model for the @xmath4-wave superconductor with electronic coupling to both @xmath0 and half - breathing stretching phonon modes .",
    "the time - dependent effective temperatures for the respective subsystems are evaluated depending on the strength of pump fluence . with the obtained time - dependence of effective temperatures ,",
    "the time - resolved optical conductivity and raman spectra and their pump - fluence dependence are presented in secs .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] and [ sec : chi ] .",

    "hereafter , we set @xmath67 , giving a fwhm of about 10.34 fs . this value is smaller than the commonly used experimental values of about 30 - 50 fs but is indeed close to that value of 12 fs used in the recent tr experiment on yba@xmath42cu@xmath68o@xmath69 .",
    "@xcite we believe that this variation will not affect the qualitative physics , as will be presented below .",

    "figure  [ fig : effectivet ] shows the time evolution of the effective temperature for each subsystem for ( a ) a large pump power intensity @xmath39 and ( b ) an intermediate value of @xmath40 .",
    "these values of pump power corresponds to @xmath73 and @xmath74 of pump fluence in bi-2212 by assuming a 60 nm of optical absorption depth .",
    "starting from the initial temperature @xmath75 , the electron temperature @xmath41 increases rapidly after photoexcitation , and the superconductor is driven into the normal state while exhibiting a kink structure at @xmath1 ( inset of fig .",

    "[ fig : effectivet](b ) ) , due to the fact that the highest temperature achieved by electrons is very sensitive to the pump fluence . in both cases ,",
    "the hot phonon subsystems are first heated up through their coupling to the photoexcited electrons , and after reaching their maximum temperature , they cool down by dissipating energy into the cold lattice through anharmonic coupling .",
    "a noticeable difference between the large and intermediate pump fluences is that in the latter case , the superconducting state recovers more rapidly ( i.e. , @xmath77 ) in a very short time ( @xmath78 ) , with the kink recurring during the cooling stage ( inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : effectivet](b ) ) . further energy relaxation is then slowed down significantly due to the opening of the superconducting gap .",

    "figure  [ sigma ] shows the time evolution of the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath92 at several selected time delays . from fig .",
    "[ sigma ] , one can see that at all time delays , the optical conductivity shows the well - known drude peak at @xmath93 , due to the nodal quasiparticles for the @xmath4-wave gap symmetry .",
    "in addition , for @xmath94 fs and @xmath95 fs , at which the material is superconducting and @xmath96 mev , we observe that @xmath92 exhibits a broad peak at about @xmath97 .",
    "( the specific location may be affected by several factors , although @xmath98 plays a substantial role . )",
    "our observation is consistent with earlier study of optical conductivity in the thermal equilibrium state of htscs .",
    "@xcite in contrast , no peak at @xmath99 is observed ( a signature of the coupling between electrons and the half - breathing mode along the nodal directions ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the coupling between electrons and the @xmath0 phonon mode is the strongest at the @xmath52 points , at which the van hove singularity is also located .",
    "this is further verified by the observation that no such peak appears when the el - ph coupling is turned off in the initial superconducting state @xmath100 ( red solid line in fig .",

    "figure  [ raman ] shows the time evolution of the raman scattering spectrum .",
    "when the electron - hot phonon coupling is switched off , the raman spectrum rises with @xmath113 and has a large peak at twice the gap , @xmath114 , at the initial temperature ( red solid line in fig .",
    "[ raman ] ) . a small shoulder in the curve around",
    "90 mev arises due to the van hove singularity . in the presence of the electron - hot phonon coupling ,",
    "the superconducting gap function is renormalized , which shifts the original @xmath115-peak to lower frequencies .",
    "simultaneously , another peak develops at @xmath98 but no peak develops at @xmath103 , for the same reason for the optical conductivity ( fig .",
    "[ sigma ] ) .",
    "after photoexcitation , this double - peak structure evolves into a very broad peak as the system enters the normal state . for large @xmath76 , this broad peak remains for a few picoseconds .",
    "however , for intermediate @xmath76 , once the superconducting state recovers , the double - peak structure appears again .",
    "this result is fully consistent with our calculations of the tr optical conductivity described above .",
    "we have presented a theory for the time - resolved optical conductivity and raman spectrum , based on the tr spectral function that we have recently formulated for htscs .",
    "our calculations show that the signature of the electron-@xmath0 mode coupling in the tr optical conductivity and raman spectrum is more pronounced than the consequence of the coupling between electrons and the half breathing mode .",
    "this is the result of a concurrence of anisotropy of the el - ph coupling , band structure , and @xmath4-wave energy gap in htscs .",
    "even more interestingly , this signature also shows a re - entrant behavior in concurrence with the superconducting condensate , which can be controlled by the pump fluence .",
