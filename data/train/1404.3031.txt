    "the classical theory by hodgkin and huxley ( hh ) describes nerve impulses ( spikes ) that manifest communication between nerve cells .",
    "the underlying mechanism of a single spike is excitability , i.e. , a small disturbance triggers a large excursion that reverts without further input to the original state .",
    "a spike lasts a 1/1000 second and even though during this period ions are exchanged across the nerve cell membrane , the change in the corresponding ion concentrations can become significant only in series of such spikes . under certain pathological conditions",
    "changes in ion concentrations become massive and last minutes to hours before they recover .",
    "this establishes a new type of excitability underlying communication failure between nerve cells during migraine and stroke . to clarify this mechanism and to recognize the relevant factors that determine the slow time scales of ion changes",
    ", we use an extended version of the classical hh theory .",
    "we identify one variable of particular importance , the potassium ion gain or loss through some reservoirs provided by the nerve cell surroundings .",
    "we suggest to describe the new excitability as a sequence of two fast processes with constant total ion content separated by two slow processes of ion clearance ( loss ) and re  uptake ( re  gain ) .",
    "in this paper we study ion dynamics in ion  based neuron models . in comparison to classical hh type membrane models",
    "this introduces dynamics on much slower time scales . while spiking activity is in the order of milliseconds , the time scales of ion dynamics range from seconds to minutes and even hours depending on the process ( transmembrane fluxes , glial buffering , backward buffering ) .",

    "such newly emerging dynamics can be understood from the phase space structure of the ion  based models .",

    "the discovery of sd by leo in 1944 @xcite  a severe perturbation of neural ion homeostasis associated with a huge changes in the potassium , sodium and chloride ion concentrations in the extracellular space ( ecs)@xcite that spreads through the tissue  has attracted many modelling approaches dealing with the propagation of large ion concentration variations in tissue . in 1963 grafstein described spatial potassium dynamics during sd in a reaction  diffusion framework with a phenomenological cubic rate function for the local potassium release by the neurons@xcite .",

    "were studied in hh  like membrane models that were extended to include ion changes in the intracellular space ( ics ) and the ecs since the 1980s . while the first extensions of this type were developed for cardiac cells by difranceso and noble@xcite , the first cortical model in this spirit",
    "was developed by kager , wadman and somjen ( kws)@xcite only in 2000 .",
    "their model contains abundant physiological detail in terms of morphology and ion channels , and was in fact designed for seizure  like activity ( sla ) and local sd dynamics .",
    "it succeeded spectacularly in reproducing the experimentally known phenomenology .",
    "an even more detailed model was proposed by shapiro at the same time@xcite who  like yao , huang and miura for kws@xcite  also investigated sd propagation with a spatial continuum ansatz .    in the following hh  like models of intermediate complexity were developed by frhlich , bazhenov et al .  to describe potassium dynamics during epileptiform bursting@xcite .",
    "the simplest hh  like model of cortical ion dynamics was developed by barreto , cressman et al.@xcite who describe the effect of ion dynamics in epileptiform bursting modulation in a single compartment model that is based on the classical hh ion channels .",
    "interestingly in none of these considerably simpler than shapiro and kws models extreme ion dynamics like in sd or stroke was studied .",
    "to our knowledge the only exception is a study by zandt et al .   who describe in the framework of cressman et al .  what they call the `` wave of death '' that follows the anoxic depolarization after decapitation as measured in experiments with rats@xcite",

    "moreover we analyze oscillatory dynamics in open systems and thereby relate sla and sd to different so  called torus bifurcations .",
    "this categorizes sla and sd as genuinely different though they are ` sibling ' dynamics as they both bifurcate from the same ` parent ' limit cycle in a supercritical and subcritical manner , respectively , which also explains the all  or  none nature of sd .",

    "such processes can be included to ion  based neuron models and make ion regulation during sd much slower@xcite .    for our purpose",
    "it is however sufficient to assume smaller values from the beginning .",
    "we remark that the ion regulation schemes in our model only refer to vascular coupling and glial buffering .",
    "lateral ion movement between the ecs of nearby neurons is a different diffusive process that determines the velocity of a travelling sd wave in tissue .",

    "the above presented model is indeed the simplest ion  based neuron model that exhibits local sd dynamics .",
    "model simplicity is an appealing feature in its own right , but one might doubt the physiological relevance of such a reduced model .",
    "our hypothesis is that it captures very general dynamical features of neuronal ion dynamics , and to confirm this we will compare the results obtained with the reduced model to the physiologically much more detailed kws model@xcite .",

    "in fact in ref .",
    "@xcite the kws model was used without additional ion regulation for a reaction  diffusion study of sd , and the only recovery mechanism of the local system seems to be this unphysical current . theoretically sd could be a travelling wave in a reaction  diffusion system with bistable local dynamics , but unpublished results show that the propagation properties in the bistable system are dramatically different from standard sd dynamics with wave fronts and backs travelling at different velocities . we hence suppose that a local potassium clearing mechanism is crucially involved in sd .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the time scales of the model . to this end , it is helpful to keep in mind that the phenomenon of excitability requires a separation of time scales .",
    "we have electrical and ionic excitability and these dynamics themselves are separated by no fewer than three orders of magnitude .",

    "[ tab:1 ] this leads to @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "so backward buffering is much slower .",
    "this is an important property , because in the following section we will see that recovery from fes requires a strong reduction of the potassium content .",
    "if buffering and backward buffering would happen on the same time scale the required potassium reduction would not be possible .",
    "backward buffering could well happen at a considerably faster scale than eq .",
    "( [ eq:43 ] ) , but as soon as @xmath90 is comparable to @xmath91 the buffer can not re  establish physiological conditions after fes .",

    "a more biophysically detailed model would describe a glial cell as a third compartment .",
    "an elevation of ecs potassium leads to glial uptake .",
    "spatial buffering , i.e. , the fast transfer of potassium ion between glia cells with elevated concentrations to regions of lower concentrations maintains an almost constant potassium concentrations in the glial cells . in sd",
    "potassium in the ecs is strongly elevated during an about 80 sec lasting phase of fes and is continuously buffered during this time .",
    "after 80 sec the concentration quickly reduces to slightly less than the normal physiological level . still there is a local potassium deficit and what we call backward buffering , i.e. , the release of potassium from the glial cells sets in .",
    "it is much slower than the uptake , because it is driven by a far smaller deviation of the potassium concentration from physiological resting conditions of the glial cell .",
    "so as for diffusion the forward and the backward process do not actually happen simultaneously .",
    "similar to the above explanation of slow backward buffering in the glia scheme , an extremely slow backward time scale follows naturally in diffusive coupling . for diffusion",
    "the potassium content is reduced at a time scale @xmath92 if extracellular potassium is greater than @xmath58 .",
    "backward diffusion , however , only occurs in the final recovery phase that sets in after the neuron has returned from the transient fes state and is repolarized .",
    "while @xmath93 is still far from the resting state level , @xmath39 is comparable to normal physiological conditions ( see the below bifurcation diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig:1]b and [ fig:2]b ) and hence the driving force @xmath94 during the final recovery phase is very small for a bath concentration close to the physiological resting state level .",
    "consequently backward diffusion is much slower than forward diffusion .",
    "note that this argument for different slow regulation time scales only relies on the values of the ecs potassium concentration along the physiological fixed point branch , and is not a feature of the particular regulation scheme we apply .",

    "the verticality means that this is a process almost purely due to transmembrane dynamics .",
    "it is governed by the bistable phase space structure that we discussed in the previous section and also in ref .",
    "buffering dynamics is too slow to inhibit the activation .",
    "the types of stimulation we applied are related to bifurcations of the transmembrane system : the potassium elevation is beyond the end of @xmath104 which is marked by the first hopf bifurcation ( hb1 ) in fig .",

    "the interruption of pump activity means that we go below a pump rate threshold that is defined by a saddle  node bifurcation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . more generally , to initiate an ionic excitation it is necessary to stimulate the system until it enters the basin of attraction  derived in the unbuffered system  of the fes state .",
    "the activation is followed by a phase of both , slow transient transmembrane dynamics mostly due to chloride , and potassium buffering .",
    "it is the latter that bends the trajectories in the diagonal direction so that they go along the fes branches from fig .",

    "the duration of the fes phase is consequently a result of both types of dynamics .",
    "however , the main insight we gain from this plot is : glial buffering is the necessary inhibitory mechanism that takes the system to the hopf line so that it can repolarize .",
    "we remark that the time series and phase space plots for bath coupling instead of buffering are almost identical and the same interpretation holds .",
    "the more general conclusion is then : ion dynamics beyond transmembrane processes is necessary to take the system to the hopf line so that it can repolarize .",
    "this can , of course , be a combination of bath coupling and buffering . when the hopf line is reached that neuron repolarizes abruptly which is the second almost purely vertical process .",
    "the repolarization is followed by slow asymptotic recovery dynamics of ion concentrations that takes the neuron back to the initial state which is at @xmath123 mm .",
    "the neuron regains the electrical excitability that is lost during fes already right after the repolarization .",
    "so the system is back to physiological function long before the ion gradients are fully restored .",
    "let us summarize the results from this subsection . by relating the sd time series from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] to the bifurcation structure of the unbuffered models from the first subsection of sect .",
    "results and in particular to the two stable branches @xmath104 and @xmath112 we have succeeded to understand ionic excitability as a sequence of different dynamical phases .",
    "the initial depolarization and the later repolarization are membrane  mediated fast processes that obey the bistable dynamics of unbuffered systems .",
    "the fes phase is buffering  dominated and lasts until buffering has taken the system to a well  defined repolarization threshold .",
    "the recovery phase is dominated by backward buffering .",
    "the full excursion time is the sum of the durations of each phase . for the de and repolarization process",

    "the duration of the fes phase is a result of both , the transient transmembrane dynamics and glial ion regulation at a much slower time scale .",
    "the final recovery phase is mainly backward buffering dominated which is the slowest process .",
    "hence the duration of an sd excursion is mainly determined by the slow buffering and backward buffering time scales .",
    "this conclusion that relies on our novel understanding of the different thresholds involved in sd is in fact in agreement with recent experimental data suggesting vascular clearance of extracellular potassium as the central recovery mechanism in sd@xcite .",
    "the dynamics of excitable systems can often be changed to self  sustained oscillations by a suitable parameter variation .",
    "the type of bifurcation that leads to the oscillations and the shape of the limit cycle in the oscillatory regime determine excitation properties like threshold sharpness and latency@xcite .",

    "[ fig:6]b ) and periodic sd at @xmath128 with large ionic amplitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6]c ) .",
    "we see that sla and periodic sd exhibit slow oscillations of the ion concentrations and fast spiking activity , which hints at the toroidal nature of these dynamics . below we will relate sla and periodic sd to torus bifurcations of the tonic firing limit cycle .",
    "color and line style conventions for fixed points and limit cycles are figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] : black and green lines are fixed point and limit cycles , solid and dashed line styles mean stable and unstable sections",
    ". stable solution on invariant tori are blue .",

    "( b ) * does not contain the limit cycle , because it can hardly be distinguished from the fixed point line.[fig:7 ] ]    the examples in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] show that our model contains a variety of physiologically distinct and clinically important dynamical regimes . a great richness of oscillatory dynamics , in fact",

    "@xcite exclusively deals with sla .",

    "[ fig:1 ] this model contains a new type of bifurcation , namely the neimark ",
    "sacker bifurcation , also called torus bifurcation ( tr ) .",
    "a torus bifurcation is a secondary hopf bifurcation of the radius of a limit cycle in which an invariant torus is created .",
    "if this torus is stable , nearby trajectories will be asymptotically bound to its surface .",
    "however , we can not follow such solutions with standard continuation techniques , because these require an algebraic formulation in terms of the oscillation period .",
    "this is not possible for torus solutions , because on a torus the motion is quasiperiodic , i.e. , characterized by two incommensurate frequencies .",
    "we can hence only track the stable solutions by integrating the equations of motion and slowly varying @xmath95 .",
    "it is due to this numerically expensive method that in this section we will only analyze oscillatory dynamics of the reduced hh model with time ",

    "the result of this bifurcation analysis in fig.[fig:7 ] shows us that there is a maximal level @xmath132 of the bath concentration compatible with physiological conditions .",

    "normal physiological conditions become unstable at @xmath132 and above this value the neuron spikes continuously according to the stable limit cycle branch between pd and tr4 . when @xmath133 is reached the dynamics changes from stationary spiking to seizure  like activity on an invariant torus .",
    "the beginning of sla is hence due to a supercritical torus bifurcation and the related ionic oscillation sets in with finite period and zero amplitude . from @xmath134 on tonic spiking activity is stable again and there is a small @xmath95range of bistability between sla and this tonic firing . as we mentioned above solutions on an invariant torus can not be followed with normal continuation tools like auto , so only stable branches are detected .",
    "the details of the bifurcation scenario at tr3 are hence not totally clear , but we suspect that the unstable invariant torus that must exist near tr3 collides with the right end of the stable torus sla  branch in a saddle  node bifurcation of tori .",
    "tonic spiking then remains stable until tr2 .",
    "this bifurcation is related to the period sd that already exist well below @xmath135 .",
    "in fact , the threshold value @xmath135 is in agreement with experiments@xcite . again",
    "the unstable torus near tr2 is not detected , but we suppose that a similar scenario as in tr3 occurs .",
    "the dynamics on the torus branch related to tr2 ( and tr1 where it seems to end ) is very different from the first torus branch . while the periods of the slow oscillations during sla are 1645 sec the ion oscillations of periodic sds are much slower with periods of 350550 sec .",
    "another crucial difference is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig:7]b which shows the bifurcation diagram in the @xmath131plane .",
    "the fixed point is just a straight line , because the diffusive coupling eq .",
    "( [ eq:33 ] ) makes @xmath136 a necessary fixed point condition .",
    "the limit cycle is always extremely close to this line . on the chosen scale",
    "it can not be distinguished from the fixed point and is hence not contained in the plot . only the torus solutions of sd and sla",
    "attain @xmath39 values that differ significantly from the regulation level .",
    "the ionic amplitudes of sd are one order of magnitude larger than those of sla .",
    "this has to do with the fact that the peak of sd  as described above  must be understood as a metastable fes state that exists due to the bistability of the transmembrane dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of sla is clearly of a different nature .",
    "note that the bifurcation diagram reveals a bistability of tonic firing and full  blown sd between the left end of the sd branch at about 11 mm and tr2 .",
    "this means that there is no gradual increase in the ionic amplitudes that slowly leads to sd , but instead it implies that sd is a manifest all  or  none process .    .",
    "panel * ( a ) * shows the extracellular sodium concentration and includes an inset around tr4 and pd .",
    "panel * ( b ) * presents the potassium gain / loss.[fig:8 ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] we look at the same bifurcation diagram in the @xmath137 and the @xmath138plane . while in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] most of the ionic phase space structure is hidden , because @xmath139 for fixed points and limit cycles , the @xmath137presentation in fig .",
    "[ fig:8]a provides further insights into the ion dynamics .",
    "we see that the stable fixed point branch before hb1 has extracellular sodium concentrations close to the physiological value @xmath140 .",
    "the stable branch after hb4 , however , has an extremely reduced extracellular sodium level and is indeed fes  like .",
    "the stable limit cycles between pd and tr4 and between tr3 and tr2 , and also sla are rather close to the physiological sodium level . on the other hand ,",
    "periodic sd is an oscillation between fes and normal physiological conditions , which is an expected confirmation of the findings from the previous section .",
    "[ fig:8]b is useful in connecting the phase space structure of the bath coupled system to that of the transmembrane model of the first subsection of sect",
    ".  results .",
    "if we interchange the @xmath95 and the @xmath40axis in the diagram it looks very similar to fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b .",
    "the torus bifurcations tr1 , tr2 and tr3 are very close to the limit point bifurcations @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 of the transmembrane model .",
    "the fixed point curves are topologically identical .",
    "this striking similarity has to do with the fact that the limit cycle in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] has almost constant ion concentrations .",
    "we have pointed out in the first subsection of sect .",
    "results that fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] tells us which extracellular potassium concentrations are stable for pure transmembrane dynamics .",
    "diffusive coupling with bath concentrations at such potassium levels leads to negligibly small values of @xmath144 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq:33 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore the limit cycle is still present in the bath coupled model and also the stability changes can be related to those in the transmembrane model . again",
    "this can be seen as a confirmation of the results from the previous section : the transmembrane phase space plays a central role for models that are coupled to external reservoirs .",
    "we can interpret the ionic oscillations from fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and the bifurcations leading to them with respect to this phase space .    .",
    "only extracellular potassium is shown .",
    "the limit cycle and fixed point curves from figs .  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:3 ] are superimposed to the plots as shaded lines whereas the limit cycle and fixed point from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( dynamical chloride ) are darker .",
    "the limit cycle and fixed point are not graphically distinguished , but comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] should avoid confusion .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ]    last we consider the dynamics of sla and periodic sd in a phase space projection . in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] the trajectories for sla and periodic sd are plotted in the @xmath103plane together with the underlying fixed point and limit cycles from the transmembrane model ( cf .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the periodic sd trajectory has a very similar shape to the single sd excursion from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and is clearly guided by the stable fixed point branches @xmath104 and @xmath112 . on the other hand sla is a qualitatively very different phenomenon . rather than relating to the fes branch",
    ", it is an oscillation between physiological conditions and those stable limit cycles that exist for moderately elevated extracellular potassium concentrations .",
    "the ion concentrations remain far from fes .",
    "so sla and sd are not only related to distinct bifurcations , though of similar toroidal nature and branching from the same limit cycle , but they are also located far from each other in the phase space .",
    "this completes our phase space analysis of local ion dynamics in open neuron systems",
    "in this paper we have analyzed dynamics at different time scales in a hh model that includes time ",
    "dependent ion concentrations .",
    "such models are also called second generation hodgkin  huxley models .",
    "they exhibit two types of excitability , electrical and ionic excitability , which are based on fast and slow dynamics .",
    "the time scales of these types of excitability are themselves separated by four to five orders of magnitude .",
    "the dynamics ranges from high  frequency bursts of about 100 hz with short interburst periods of the order of 10 msec ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6]a ) to the slow periodic sd with frequencies of about @xmath145 hz and periods of about 7:30 min ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6]c ) .",
    "the slow sd dynamics in our model is classified as ultra  slow or near  dc ( direct current ) activity and can not normally be observed by electroencephalography ( eeg ) recordings , because of artifacts due to the resistance of the dura ( thick outermost layer of the meninges that surrounds the brain ) .",
    "however , recently subdural eeg recordings provided evidence that sds occur in abundance in people with structural brain damage@xcite .",
    "indirect evidence was provided already earlier by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri)@xcite and patient s symptom reports combined with fmri@xcite that sd also occurs in migraine with aura@xcite .",
    "the slowest dynamics that can be accurately measured by eeg , i.e. , the delta band , with frequencies about 0.5 to 4 hz , has attracted modelling approaches much more than sd , which was doubted to occur in human brain until the first direct measurements were reported .",
    "it is interesting to compare the origin of slow time scales in such delta band models to our slow dynamics .",
    "models of the delta band essentially come in two types . on the one hand thalamo ",
    "cortical network and mean field models of hh neurons with fixed ion concentrations have been studied@xcite . in this case , a slow time scale emerges because the cells are interconnected via synaptic connections using metabotropic receptors that are slow , because they act through second messengers . on the other hand , single neuron models with currents that are not contained in hh , namely a hyperpolarization  activated depolarizing current , @xmath146dependent sodium and potassium currents , and a persistent sodium current , were suggested .",
    "the interplay between these currents gives rise to oscillations at a frequency of about 23 hz@xcite .",
    "it is therefore hardly surprising that these currents , in particular the persistent sodium and the @xmath146dependent sodium and potassium currents , have also been proposed to play an essential role in sd@xcite .",
    "furthermore , bursting as another example of slow modulating dynamics was studied in a pure conductance  based model with a dendritic and an axo  somatic compartment @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those approaches our results show that already dynamics in a hh framework with time ",
    "dependent ion concentrations and buffer reservoirs range from seconds to hours even with the original set of voltage  gated ion currents .",
    "time scales from milliseconds ( membrane dynamics ) to seconds ( ion dynamics ) and even minutes to hours ( ion exchange with reservoirs ) can be directly computed from the model parameters ( cf.sect .",
    "the interplay of membrane dynamics , ion dynamics and coupling to external reservoirs ( glia or vasculature ) naturally leads to dynamics typical of sla and sd .     and @xmath112 ( see sec .  results ) and the directions ( arrows ) of two paths of ` pure ' flux condition : fluxes exclusively across the membrane and fluxes exclusively from ( or to ) reservoirs .",
    "a horizontal path is caused by a particular mixture of these fluxes that induces potassium ion concentration changes exclusively to the intracellular compartment .",
    "ionic excitability can be understood as a cyclic process in this diagram ( see text ) .",
    "[ fig : bifdiagram ] ]    in particular sd is explained by a bistability of neuronal ion dynamics that occurs in the absence of external reservoirs . the potassium gain or loss @xmath40 through reservoirs provided by an extracellular bath ,",
    "the vasculature or the glial cells is identified as a bifurcation parameter whose essential importance was not realized in earlier studies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bifdiagram ] ) . using this bifurcation parameter and the extracellular potassium concentration as the order parameter",
    ", we obtain a folded fixed point curve with the two outer stable branches corresponding to states with normal physiological function , hence named physiological branch @xmath104 , and to states being free  energy starved ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the definition of the bifurcation parameter implies that exchange with ion reservoirs happens along the diagonal direction labelled by ` r ' .",
    "mediated dynamics is in the vertical ` m ' direction . in the full system where the ion exchange is a dynamical variable our unconventional choice of variables , i.e. modelling @xmath40 instead of @xmath39 , makes it obvious that the time scales of diagonal and vertical dynamics is separated by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "slow dynamics is along @xmath104 and @xmath112 , and the fast dynamics describes the jumps between these branches .",
    "we remark that dynamics along @xmath147 is slower than along @xmath148 , because the branch is almost horizontal which leads to a very small gradient driving the diffusive coupling .",
    "similarly the release of buffered potassium from the glia cells is only weakly driven ( cf .",
    "the discussion of buffering time scales in sect .",
    "model ) .    in the closed system sufficiently strong stimulations lead to the transition from the physiological resting state located on @xmath147 to fes . in the full system with dynamical ion exchange with the reservoirs ,",
    "physiological conditions are restored after a large phase space excursion to the the before stable fes state .",
    "we refer to this process as ionic excitability .",
    "in contrast to the electrical excitability of the membrane potential this process involves large changes in the ion concentrations . the entire phase space excursion of this excitation process can be explained through the specific transits between and along @xmath104 and @xmath112 .",
    "we observe ion changes on three slow time scales .",
    "( i ) vertical transits between @xmath104 and @xmath112 caused by transmembrane dynamics in the order of seconds .",
    "the time scale is determined by the volume ",
    "surface  area ratio and the membrane permeability to the ions .",
    "( ii ) diagonal dynamics along @xmath112 in the order of tens of seconds caused by contact to ion reservoirs .",
    "this time scale is determined by buffer time constants or vascular coupling strength .",
    "( iii ) dynamics on @xmath104 again caused by contact to ion reservoirs , but at the slower backward buffering time scale in the order of minutes to hours determined by the slower backward rate of the buffer @xcite . during this long refractory phase of ionic excitability the spiking dynamics based on electrical excitability  separated by seven orders of magnitude  seems fully functional .",
    "the right end of @xmath147 and the left end of @xmath148 are marked by bifurcations that occur for an accordingly elevated or reduced potassium content .",
    "this is the first explanation of thresholds for local sd dynamics in terms of bifurcations .",
    "we remark , however , that for sd ignition the important question is not where @xmath147 ends , but instead where the basin of attraction of @xmath148 begins .",
    "this new understanding of sd dynamics suggests a method to investigate the sd susceptibility of a given neuron model . one should consider the closed model without coupling to external reservoirs and check if shows the typical bistability between a physiological resting state and fes .",
    "we remark that unphysical so  called ` fixed leak ' currents must be replaced by proper leak currents with associated leaking ions .",
    "thresholds for the transition between @xmath148 and @xmath147 translate to thresholds for sd ignition and repolarization , i.e. , recovery from fes in the full open model .",
    "knowledge of the potassium reduction needed to reach the repolarization threshold and knowledge about the buffer capacity could then tell us if recovery from fes can be expected ( such as in migraine with aura ) or if the depolarization is terminal ( such as in stroke ) .",
    "although our model does not contain all important processes involved in sd , our phase space explanation appears to be valid also for certain model extensions .",
    "for example , considering only diffusive regulation of potassium is physically inconsistent , but adding an analoguous regulation term for sodium turns out not to alter the dynamics qualitatively .",
    "moreover osmosis  driven cell swelling  normally regarded as a key indicator of sd  is not included in our model , but can be added easily@xcite .",
    "unpublished results confirm that also with such cell swelling dynamics the fundamental bifurcation structure of fig .",
    "[ fig : bifdiagram ] is preserved .    as a clinical application of our framework ,",
    "we have linked a genetic defect , which affects the inactivation gate @xmath4 and which is present in a rare subtype of migraine with aura , to sd .",
    "our simulations show that such mutations render neurons more vulnerable to sd@xcite .",
    "the interesting point , however , is that on the level of the fast time scale the firing rate is decreased , which in a mean field approach ( as done for the delta band ) translates to decreased activity .",
    "this effect seemingly contradicts the increased sd susceptibility and hence illustrates the pitfalls in trying to neglect ion dynamics in the brain and to bridge the gap in time scales by population models .",
