    "in order to describe heavy ion reactions as the dynamics of many - nucleon systems , two different kinds of microscopic approaches have been proposed and applied .",
    "one is the molecular dynamics models @xcite and the other is the mean field ( tdhf - like ) models @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the mean field models is that they do not put any restriction on the one - body motion , while their disadvantage is that they can not properly describe the cluster formation because of the lack of many - body cluster correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "usual molecular dynamics models assume a fixed gaussian shape for single particle wave functions .",
    "this is an efficient way to describe the cluster correlation even by using a simple product wave function with or without antisymmetrization .",
    "however , in another sense , the use of localized wave packets can be a regression because the one - body dynamics is not as precisely described as in mean field models .",
    "an unified understanding is desired on the question whether the single particle wave functions should be unrestricted or localized .",
    "unless we can solve the dynamics keeping the full order of the many - body correlations , it is essential for a reasonable model to introduce the fluctuations which bring the system into many quantum branches each of which corresponds to one of the reaction channels or the configurations of clusterization . in mean field models",
    ", it has been proposed to introduce fluctuations in the one - body distribution function @xcite , though it should be a difficult problem to determine the correlations among an infinite number of the degrees of freedom of fluctuations . in this viewpoint ,",
    "the philosophy of molecular dynamics is to introduce a special kind of fluctuation by stochastically localizing the single particle wave functions , which is essential for the cluster production .",
    "the mean field equation should be interpreted as giving the short - time evolution of the one - body distribution averaged over the stochastic branches . based on this idea",
    ", the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) has been extended in refs .",
    "@xcite by incorporating the wave packet diffusion effect in the mean field as a source of the fluctuation to the wave packet centroid which causes the quantum branching on the many - body level .",
    "thus the single particle wave functions are localized in each branch , which makes cluster formation possible , while the single particle motion is not restricted for the averaged value over the branches .",
    "the stochastic treatment of the dynamics of the wave packet width is the essential point of our approach .",
    "there is another approach @xcite which treats the width parameters as time - dependent variables in molecular dynamics , though it has turned out that the deterministic dynamics of the width variables can not explain the evolution of the density fluctuation and the multiple cluster formation @xcite .",
    "ohnishi and randrup @xcite have introduced quantum fluctuation into wave packet molecular dynamics based on their statistical consideration and have shown its importance in cluster formation .",
    "however the dynamical origin of the their fluctuation has not been made clear .",
    "an unsatisfactory point of the improvement in refs .",
    "@xcite was that the stochastic fluctuation to the wave packet centroids can diffuse the distribution but can not shrink the distribution .",
    "note that a wave packet in the mean field normally diffuses in three directions in phase space and shrinks in the other three directions .",
    "because of this difficulty , for example , the improved amd could not be directly applied to an isolated nucleon , and therefore the diffusion was switched off for isolated nucleons , which introduces an ambiguity to the model . to solve this kind of problems , we absolutely need a consistent understanding of both the mean field description and the molecular dynamics description .",
    "the first purpose of the present work is to construct a general framework which contains both molecular dynamics models and mean field models as specific cases . in this framework ,",
    "the time evolution of a many - body system is given by the coherent mean field propagation and the decoherence of single particle states into wave packets .",
    "it will have two physically essential ingredients , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which define when `` decoherence '' and `` mean field branching '' take place , respectively .",
    "the choice @xmath3 corresponds to a mean field model , while the choice @xmath4 corresponds to the version of amd of refs .",
    "@xcite ( called amd / d in this paper ) . based on this general framework , we introduce a new model amd / ds as the case of @xmath5 , with which we can respect not only the diffusion but also the shrinking of the phase space distribution predicted by the coherent mean field propagation .",
    "the second purpose of the present work is to demonstrate the effect of the wave packet shrinking .",
    "the difference between amd / d and amd / ds is expected to result in the different diffusion properties of nucleons in nuclear matter and the different global one - body dynamics .",
    "we perform the amd / d and amd / ds calculations for the central @xmath6 collisions at 50 mev / nucleon and compare the results .",
    "the velocity of the expansion strongly depends on the model .",
    "the different expansion velocity results in the different cluster size distribution .",
    "it is shown , by comparison with indra experimental data , that amd / d had problems of the overestimation of @xmath7 clusters and the underestimation of @xmath8 clusters and these problems are solved by amd / ds .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formulation ] , the formulation is presented .",
    "the physical principle of the general framework is given in [ subsec : principle ] , and then the concrete formulae are given in [ subsec : formulation ] which includes all the details . in [ subsec : specificmodels ] , we introduce specific models such as amd / d and amd / ds , and give simple examples to show how our formulation works for amd / d and amd / ds . in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc ] , the results of the calculations with amd / d and amd / ds are compared to each other and to the indra data for central @xmath0 collisions at 50 mev / nucleon , so as to demonstrate the important effect of the wave packet shrinking in amd / ds in multifragmentation .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary .",
    "first we give a general framework which includes both mean field models and molecular dynamics models as limiting cases of model parameters .",
    "originally we have reached this framework in the course of an extension of amd by the incorporation of good points of mean field models .",
    "however , the framework is given here from a more general point of view as an approximation of quantum many - body dynamics .",
    "in what follows , the two - nucleon collision effect is not shown explicitly for the brevity of presentation , but it is always considered in all the practical calculations as a stochastic process @xcite .    in this model , we will use ( without specifying yet how to use it ) the amd wave function which is a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets @xcite , @xmath9 .",

    "we take the width parameter @xmath11 @xmath12 and the spin isospin states @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , or @xmath16 . because of the antisymmetrization",
    ", the variables @xmath17 do not necessarily have a direct physical meaning as nucleon positions and momenta .",
    "the amd wave function @xmath18 contains many quantum features in it and has been applied to the study of nuclear structure problems with some extensions such as the parity and angular momentum projections @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent many body wave function @xmath19 describing a complicated nuclear collision is , in an intermediate or final state , a superposition of a huge number of channels each of which corresponds to a different clusterization configuration .",
    "we do not try to directly treat such a complicated many - body state @xmath19 nor we do not approximate @xmath19 by a single amd wave function @xmath18 .",
    "we rather approximate the many - body density matrix @xmath20 by an ensemble of many amd wave functions , @xmath21 a pure many - body state is approximated by a mixed state",
    ". this approximation itself will not be a serious drawback practically because the nuclear collision dynamics is so complicated that one can not observe full many - body correlations to distinguish a pure state from a mixed state .",
    "the benefit of this approximation is that the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : amdensemble ] ) still contains nontrivial many - body correlations required in multiple cluster formation , even though an ensemble of amd wave functions is sufficiently simple to be tractable numerically .",
    "we should , of course , define a reasonable time evolution of the weight @xmath22 or , alternatively , stochastic trajectories of the variables @xmath23 .    what is the physical idea when we use amd wave functions @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : amdensemble ] ) ? when multiple cluster formation takes place , @xmath19 is composed of a huge number of branches . the decomposition into branches should be done so that , in each branch , the one - body distribution of each nucleon is localized in one of the clusters .",
    "namely , a nucleon should not belong to many clusters at the same time , to avoid non - integer mass numbers of clusters .",
    "[ the width of wave packets @xmath24 has been chosen in such a way . ] in turn , if nucleons are localized in each branch , the clusters are naturally bound due to the mean field among localized nucleons .",
    "this idea exists behind the molecular dynamics models which restrict each single particle wave function in each branch to a wave packet .",
    "the time evolution in our model is determined by two factors , the mean field propagation and the decomposition into branches . at a time @xmath25 ,",
    "let us take one of the branches @xmath26 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : amdensemble ] ) .",
    "this is justified because the time evolution of a branch is independent of the others due to linear quantum mechanics .",
    "we consider the mean field propagation from @xmath25 to @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the solution of the mean field equation @xmath30 with the initial condition @xmath31 .",

    "we wish to emphasize that the single particle wave functions are not restricted to gaussian packets in the mean field propagation and therefore @xmath29 is a general slater determinant .",
    "next , at the time @xmath27 , the propagated state @xmath36 is decomposed into amd wave functions as @xmath37 with a suitable weight @xmath38 . a reasonable principle to determine @xmath38 would be first to choose a set of important ( one - body ) operators @xmath39 and then to require that both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomp2branches ] ) give the same expectation values for all @xmath39 , @xmath40 however , this prescription will not always work well because it is incompatible to the necessary condition @xmath41 .",

    "but the mean field propagation is not perfect at least in that it unphysically keeps the idempotency @xmath42 of the one - body density matrix . in many - body systems , even though the idempotency is satisfied at a time , it is not the case at a later time due to many - body correlations",
    ". the reduced one - body density matrix will be an ensemble of idempotent density matrices .",

    "we do not try to determine @xmath1 a priori in the present paper , but we assume that decoherence is a physical process as should be the case at least in multiple cluster formation .",
    "it should be noted that the physical state changes by decoherence , and therefore eq .  ( [ eq : weightrequirement ] ) should not be required for all the operators @xmath39 .",

    "closely related to the decoherence of a nucleon , we should decide how this nucleon interacts with the rest of the system , namely , how this nucleon contributes to the mean field potential @xmath33 .",
    "once decoherence takes place at @xmath27 so that different branches in eq.([eq : onebodydecoherenceinmanybody ] ) do not interfere any longer , then the mean field should be calculated in each branch , independently of the other branches , by using the corresponding wave packet ( one of @xmath44 , @xmath45 ,  ) .",
    "we will call this change of the mean field `` mean field branching '' .",

    "nevertheless , we may think of the other possibility that the time scale of mean field branching , denoted by @xmath2 , is shorter than @xmath1 .",
    "the choice @xmath50 can be reasonable in such a physical situation that , even before decoherence , the mean field approximation is applicable not to @xmath51 of eq.([eq : onebodydecoherenceinmanybody ] ) but to each of the `` pre - branches '' in the right hand side of eq.([eq : onebodydecoherenceinmanybody ] ) even when the pre - branches have not been decohered yet ( i.e. , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ,   are not orthogonal ) .",
    "this situation is possible because the true time evolution is linear while the mean field approximation is nonlinear .",

    "the choice of wave packets as decohered states is done for this purpose .",
    "of course , the two - body collision effect destroys the idempotency of the one - body density matrix , but this effect is already taken into account by a more explicit way of the stochastic two - nucleon collision process @xcite in all the realistic calculations .",

    "[ fig : expana ] , the difference does not appear in the global transverse momentum , and therefore the energy spectra are not good quantities to see the effect directly .",
    "the different expansion velocity is not due to the different momentum but due to the different strength of the spatial component of the fluctuation to the wave packet centroids .",
    "therefore , we should look at the quantities which carry the information of the increase rate of the spatial radius .",
    "the cluster size distribution is one of such quantities because each cluster is formed by the nucleons with similar spatial positions and velocities .",
    "it has been shown that the cluster size decreases as the expansion velocity increases @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : zratio - dy ] shows how the total 104 protons in the system are divided into clusters at @xmath210 fm/@xmath211 before calculating the statistical decay of excited clusters .",
    "the results of amd / ds and amd / d are shown in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "it is clearly seen that heavy clusters are produced more abundantly in amd / ds than in amd / d , reflecting the different expansion velocity . in the case of the original amd calculation circles ) linked to the early stage dynamics of amd / ds [ shown in ( c ) ] , the produced clusters are much bigger than in amd / ds , reflecting the very slow expansion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zmulti ] , the final charge distribution after statistical decay is shown together with the indra data ( bullets ) .",
    "the data and the calculated results can be directly compared , since the filter has been applied to the calculated events in order to take account of the properties of the detector system .",
    "the result of amd / d has a serious problem that the multiplicity of the heavy clusters with @xmath8 are underestimated .",
    "instead of the heavy clusters , the relatively light clusters with @xmath233 are produced too abundantly .",
    "therefore , it seems that the expansion is too fast in amd / d . on the other hand ,",
    "the reproduction by amd / ds is quite satisfactory for the charge distribution of the clusters with @xmath234 .",
    "these results suggest that it is reasonable to respect the mean field prediction of the expansion dynamics in this reaction system which consists of rather many nucleons and is expanding with a moderate velocity",
    ". however , amd / ds has a problem of the overestimation of the proton multiplicity and the underestimation the @xmath235 particle multiplicity .",
    "probably this is a side effect of the fact that amd / ds uses the mean field equation so faithfully that the light cluster emission is not respected compared to the nucleon emission .",
    "a special care @xcite will be necessary to explain the direct production of light clusters which have only one quantum bound state .",
    "the use of the semiclassical version of the mean field equation ( the vlasov equation ) may also be one of the reasons why the nucleon emission is overestimated .",
    "the above quantitative results can be affected , in principle , by the centrality selection method . in our calculation",
    "all the events with @xmath205 fm are considered as central events , while in experiment the central events are selected by using the sum of the transverse energies ( @xmath236 ) of observed light charged particles ( @xmath237 ) . the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig : zmulti ] were obtained by selecting the events with the condition @xmath217 mev @xcite .",
    "[ these data are identical to those which have been shown by the histogram in fig .  7 of ref.@xcite in an arbitrary scale , while in our figure they are shown in the absolute scale . ]",
    "nebauer _ et al .",
    "_  have shown in qmd simulation that events with @xmath238 or 7 fm are also mixed in the selected events with @xmath217 mev ( fig .  3 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in order to estimate the effect of these semi - peripheral events , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : zratio - dy](d ) the charge partitioning obtained by amd / d for @xmath232 fm .",
    "we can see that the character of clusterization in semi - peripheral events is not very different from the central events [ fig .",
    "[ fig : zratio - dy](b ) ] .",
    "the difference between central and semi - peripheral events in amd / d calculation [ ( b ) and ( d ) ] is not as big as the difference between amd / d and amd / ds in central events [ ( b ) and ( a ) ] . therefore , a possible considerable mixture of semi - peripheral events in the data does not change our conclusion that too many small clusters are produced in amd / d and that the reproduction is improved by respecting the coherence mean field propagation as in amd / ds .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : zmulti ] .",
    "solid and dotted histograms are the same as in fig .",

    "the stars show the result of the calculation with amd / ds combined with the old treatment of the zero - point kinetic energy subtraction .",
    "the bullets show the result of the calculation with amd / d combined with the new treatment of the zero - point kinetic energy subtraction . ]    finally , the dependence on the treatment of the zero - point kinetic energy subtraction is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : zmulti - subzero ] for the cluster charge distribution .",
    "as far as the amd / d model of the quantum branching is used , the result is far from the experimental data irrelevantly to the treatment of the zero - point subtraction . in the result of",
    "amd / ds , we can get a slightly better reproduction of data by using the new treatment of the zero - point subtraction given at the end of sec .",
    "[ subsec : new ] .",
    "it should be noted that the new treatment of the zero - point subtraction is more consistent to the philosophy of the amd / ds model of the quantum branching in that the mean field prediction of the one - body dynamics is respected .",
    "in this paper , we have given a general framework which determines the many - body quantum dynamics by the combination of the coherent mean field propagation and the decoherence into branched wave packets .",
    "this framework contains the mean field description and the molecular dynamics description as specific cases .",
    "the model given by refs.@xcite ( amd / d ) corresponds to taking the zero coherence time ( @xmath177 ) for the mean field propagation . in this scheme",
    ", the wave packet diffusion by the mean field propagation is respected by giving appropriate fluctuation to the wave packet centroids . however , the usual fluctuation was not able to describe the shrinking of the phase space distribution which could be respected only by keeping the coherence of the mean field propagation .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown in this paper that it is possible to implement a finite time duration @xmath1 of the coherent mean field propagation before decoherence , even though we still adopt a branching treatment . as a consequence , in the new model ( amd / ds )",
    ", the shrinking of the phase space distribution is respected as well as the diffusion .",
    "amd / ds reproduces the exact dynamics for a free nucleon and for a nucleon in a harmonic oscillator potential with arbitrary curvatures . in general cases",
    ", the branch - averaged one - body dynamics in amd / ds should be much closer to the prediction by mean field models than in amd / d .",
    "nevertheless , by the choice of @xmath134 for mean field branching , clusters can be formed in amd / ds as well as in usual molecular dynamics models , because the mean field is calculated with localized wave packets in each branch .",
    "the two - nucleon collision effect is introduced as usual , and the decoherence into wave packets is assumed to take place when a nucleon experiences a two - nucleon collision with a substantial momentum transfer .    the difference of the decoherence scheme between the two models results in the different diffusion properties of nucleons in nuclear matter and the different global one - body dynamics .",
    "we have applied both models of amd / d and amd / ds to the @xmath0 collisions at 50 mev / nucleon in the impact parameter range @xmath205 fm , where many clusters are produced from the expanding system with a moderate expansion velocity .",
    "the effect of the wave packet shrinking in amd / ds certainly reduces the expansion velocity compared to amd / d . reflecting this difference in the expansion velocity ,",
    "the charge distribution of the produced clusters strongly depends on the model of decoherence into branches . with amd / ds , we have larger number of heavy clusters with @xmath8 and smaller number of relatively small clusters with @xmath239 than with amd / d .",
    "amd / ds reproduces the indra experimental data much better than amd / d , which suggests that the coherent mean field propagation for the one - body dynamics should be respected in this reaction system where a big system is expanding with a moderate expansion velocity .",
    "the detailed analysis of this reaction system based on the amd calculations will be given in a separate paper .",
    "however , we do not claim that amd / ds is always superior to amd / d or vice versa .",
    "these two models should be regarded as different schemes of approximation .",
    "amd / ds respects the coherent mean field propagation , while amd / d respects the existence of strong many - body correlations which causes the decoherence into branched wave packets .",
    "although the decoherence has been considered in amd / ds based on the two - nucleon collisions in this paper , it is also possible to have other many - body effects to cause decoherence , with which amd / ds can be closer to amd / d depending on the considered reaction systems . in future works , it will be important to investigate such possibilities .",
