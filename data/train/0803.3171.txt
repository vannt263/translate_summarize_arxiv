    "in 1976 , jaffe pointed out that the quark bag model predicted the existence of h dibaryon , which is a compound state of 6 quarks(uuddss)@xcite .",
    "it is the lowest bound state in dibaryon sector and will be a spin 0 strangeness -2 su(3 ) flavor singlet .",
    "jaffe s original bag model suggested that @xmath6mev , 81mev below the 2231mev @xmath7 threshold .    since jaffe s prediction , people tried to find out the h - dibaryon state both by experiment and theoretical calculation . on the experimental side , until now , there are no enough evidences on the existence of the h - dibaryon . on the theoretical side",
    ", many theoretical calculations have been maked to predict the mass of h dibaryon .",
    "one of the most efficient ways to study this state is from the first principle of qcd , i.e lattice qcd .",
    "many simulation results suggested that h dibaryon is a bound state , but some gave contrary conclusions @xcite .",
    "we perform the numerical simulations with refined methods , which includes improved gauge and fermion action , smearing techniques and tadpole improvement .",
    "to reduce computer cost and determine large masses more accurately , we do the simulations on anisotropic lattice for both gauge action and fermion action .",
    "this is our advantage comparing with what the forthgoer have done .",
    "we generate the configurations using improved , anisotropic action@xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the qcd coupling , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mean - link renormalization parameters , @xmath13 is the aspect ratio ( @xmath14 at the tree level in perturbation theory),and    @xmath15 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\omega_{tp}=\\sum_x\\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{3}retr[1-u_i(x)u_t(x+i)u^\\dagger_i(x+t)u^\\dagger_t(x ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\omega_{sr}=\\sum_x\\sum_{i \\neq j}\\frac{1}{3}retr[1-u_i(x)u_i(x+i)u_j(x+2i)u^\\dagger_i(x+j+i)u^\\dagger_i(x+j)u^\\dagger_j(x ) ] , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\omega_{str}=\\sum_x\\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{3}retr[1-u_i(x)u_i(x+i)u_t(x+2i)u^\\dagger_i(x+t+i)u^\\dagger_i(x+t)u^\\dagger_t(x ) ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 labels the sites of the lattice,@xmath17,@xmath18 are spatial indices , and @xmath19 is the parallel transport matrix in the gauge field from site @xmath16 to @xmath20 .    for the quark action , we employ the space - time asymmetric clover quark action on anisotropic lattice@xcite@xcite@xcite :    @xmath21            \\nonumber \\\\      &    & -            k_t\\sum_x[\\bar{\\psi}_x(1-\\gamma_t)u_{t , x}\\psi_{x+t}+\\bar{\\psi}_x(1+\\gamma_t)u^\\dagger_{t , x - t}\\psi_{x - t } ]            \\nonumber \\\\      &    & +            ik_sc_s\\sum_{x , i < j}\\bar{\\psi}_x\\sigma_{i , j}f_{ij}(x)\\psi_x            +            ik_sc_t\\sum_{x , i}\\bar{\\psi}_x\\sigma_{ti}f_{ti}(x)\\psi_x,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the spatial and temporal hopping parameters and the clover coefficients , respectively .",
    "the hopping parameters @xmath22 are related to the bare quark mass @xmath24 through @xmath25    we perform the simulations using tree - level improved symanzik action and clover fermion action , with gauge coupling @xmath4 and the aspect ratio @xmath26 .",
    "the lattice sizes are @xmath2 and @xmath3 .      the operator of h - dibaryon@xcite : @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 are color indices and @xmath30 are spinor indices .    and the corresponding correlation function of h dibaryon can be written as @xmath31 , which involves terms of the structure@xcite : @xmath32    to decide whether the h dibaryon is stable or not , usually we can compare the mass of @xmath7 with h - dibaryon s .",
    "the @xmath7 operator@xcite : @xmath33.\\ ] ]      to reduce the excited - state contamination , we use the smearing techniques which can provide a better overlap with the ground state@xcite . for the quark fields we use : @xmath34    a more large plateau in the region with small errors is obtained with smearing .",
    "out results are shown in tables 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "the @xmath35 is the temporal heavy kappa , which corresponds to s quark ; the @xmath36 is temporal light kappa , which corresponds to u and d quarks .",
    ".@xmath37 of the @xmath38 ( @xmath39,@xmath4,@xmath26 ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig.1 , we performed a linear fit to extrapolate the @xmath40 and @xmath41 to the physical @xmath42 , and obtained the h s mass @xmath43mev , which is lower than two @xmath44 .",
    "the difference in mass is @xmath45mev .",
    "that means the h - dibaryon tends to be a bound state but actually we ca nt make this conclusion because the error is larger than the mass difference on @xmath39 lattice . in fig.2 , on larger lattice(@xmath46 ) , @xmath47mev and @xmath48mev , indicates that the energey of h dibaryon tends to below the @xmath7 threshold .",
    "we have presented the results of the lattice investigation on the h dibaryon state employing anisotropic improved gauge and anisotropic clover fermion actions .",
    "the advantage of using anisotropic qcd actions is to get get a better signal so as to obtain a large plateau on small lattice size which can save us much more computer cost . in the mean time , the simulation results are more accurately .",
    "our results indicate that , both on the @xmath2 and @xmath49 anisotropic lattice , the masses of h dibaryon are less than that of two @xmath38s .",
    "it seems that the h dibaryon do exist as a bound state .",
    "the masses of h dibaryon on two different lattices are not so close and we believe that the finite size effect of h dibaryon should be taken into account .",
    "we plan to calculate the h dibaryon on larger lattice size to further study the finite size effect .",
    "we also intend to calculate other six quarks states , such as possible proton - antiproton , deuteron , and so on",
    ". it should be very interesting .",
    "the code is based on milc s code .",
