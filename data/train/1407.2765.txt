    "the actin cortex of nonmuscle cells is a disordered network situated at the cell periphery .",
    "actin filaments are crosslinked by proteins such as @xmath0-actinin , however these crosslinkers experience a rapid turnover , of order @xmath1  s e.g.  for @xmath0-actinin @xcite , and actin itself has a scarcely longer turnover time @xcite .",
    "the actin network is thus only transiently crosslinked .",
    "following @xcite , we describe the behaviour of such a network by a rubber - like model . up to the first order",
    ", this model leads to a stress - strain relationship of a maxwell viscoelastic liquid in which the relaxation time is a characteristic unbinding time @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the rate - of - strain tensor and @xmath5 the objective time - derivative of the stress tensor @xmath6 , see appendix  [ sup.model ] . in the linear setting , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the elastic modulus of the crosslinked actin network ,",
    "@xmath9 is inversely proportional to the kuhn length , and @xmath10 is a basic element of this network , namely the strand vector spanning the distance between any two consecutive actin  actin bonds , fig .  [ fig.atef.network ] . as long as these two bonds hold ( for times much shorter than @xmath2 ) , this basic element behaves elastically , and the stress tensor @xmath6 grows in proportion with the strain .",
    "when a crosslinker unbinds , the filaments can slide somewhat relative to one another , and the elastic tension that was maintained via this crosslinker is relaxed : this corresponds to an effective friction , and happens at a typical rate @xmath11 . in sum",
    ", the actin network behaves like an elastic solid of modulus @xmath8 over a time shorter than @xmath2 , as crosslinkers remain in place during such a solicitation , and it has a viscous - like response for longer times with an effective viscosity @xmath12 , since the network yields as crosslinkers unbind .",
    "such a viscoelastic liquid is unable to resist mechanical stresses @xcite .",
    "however living cells are able to generate stress themselves @xcite thanks to myosin bipolar filaments , which act as actin crosslinkers but are in addition able to move by one step length along one of the filaments they are bound to , using biochemical energy .",
    "let us call @xmath13 the fraction of crosslinkers which are myosin filaments , and effectuate a power - stroke of step length @xmath14 at frequency @xmath15 .",
    "the power - stroke corresponds to a change of the binding location of the myosin head along the actin filament , and thus affects the length of the neighbouring strands @xmath10 , fig .",
    "[ fig.atef.network ] .",
    "supplementary eq .  * [ eq.proba ] * includes the additional term that describes this myosin - driven evolution of the network configuration .",
    "when this equation is integrated to give the local macroscopic stress tensor @xmath6 , this term results in a contractile stress @xmath16 proportional to @xmath17 ( see appendix  [ sup.model ] ) : @xmath18 the three - parameter model obtained ( @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath16 ) is in line with early continuum models @xcite and the active gel theory @xcite , however we do not supplement this active stress with an elastic stress , unlike previous models of mechanosensitive active gels @xcite where cells are treated as viscoelastic _ solids _ ( appendix  [ sup.othermodels ] ) .",
    "the interpretation of this equation is that the contractile stress @xmath16 gives rise either to the build - up of a contractile tension @xmath6 ( if clamped boundary conditions allow no strain ) or a contractile strain rate @xmath19 ( if free boundary conditions allow strain but not tension build - up , this is e.g.  the case of super - precipitation _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite ) , or a combination of these .    lll        &    .9     &    .7     we then asked whether this simple rheological law for the actomyosin cortex could explain the behaviour of cells in our microplate experiments , fig .",
    "[ fig.atef.manip ] . to do so , we investigated the equilibrium shape and force of a thin actomyosin cortex surrounding a liquid ( the cytosol ) , in the three - dimensional geometry of the experimental setup in fig .",
    "[ fig.atef.sketch ] , appendix  [ sup.three_d ] .",
    "surprisingly , the rigidity sensing property of cells is adequately recovered by this simple model : while a fixed maximum force is predicted above a certain critical stiffness @xmath20 of the microplates , the actomyosin - generated force is proportional to @xmath21 , fig .  [ fig.f_vs_k ] .",
    "here @xmath22 is the initial plate separation and @xmath23 is the section area of the actin network .",
    "thus the contractile activity of myosin motors is enough to endow the viscoelastic liquid - like actin cortex with the spring - like response to the rigidity of its environment @xcite , a property which was introduced phenomenologically in previous models @xcite . in order to get a clear understanding of the mechanism through which this was possible",
    ", we simplified the geometry to a one - dimensional problem ( fig .",
    "[ fig.rheo.actin ] ) and found that the spring - like behaviour of the contractile fluid was retained , fig .",
    "[ fig.rheo.plot ] and appendix  [ sup.one_d ] .",
    "indeed , for an environment ( external spring ) of stiffness @xmath24 beyond the critical value @xmath25 , the contractile fluid is unable to strain beyond some plate deflection smaller than @xmath22 , and equilibrium is reached as it exerts its maximal contractility @xmath26 . for an external stiffness @xmath24 below the critical value ,",
    "the tension @xmath27 which is balanced by microplate force is smaller than @xmath26 for any admissible deflection .",
    "thus there is a nonzero rate of contraction , @xmath28 , as long as a maximal deflection is not reached , which is @xmath22 with the hypotheses done so far .",
    "the next section discusses actin polymerisation as limiting this deflection , thus setting an equilibrium cell size .",
    "the force finally achieved is proportional to @xmath24  just as a prestretched spring of stiffness @xmath25 would do ( fig .  [ fig.rheo.spring ] ) , or , alternatively , just as cells do when exhibiting a mechanosensitive behaviour @xcite ( appendix  [ sup.othermodels ] ) .",
    "this is supported by our previous report @xcite that , when the external spring stiffness is instantaneously changed in experiments , cells adapt their rate of force build - up @xmath29 to the new conditions within @xmath30  s. this observation was repeated using an afm - based technique @xcite . in @xcite , an overshoot of the rate adaptation , which relaxed to a long - term rate within @xmath1 s ,",
    "was noted in addition to the initial instantaneous change of slope . while this instantaneity at the cell scale is not explained by mechanochemical regulation ,",
    "this behaviour is fully accounted by the mechanical model proposed here ( see appendix  [ sup.one_d.stepchange ] , fig .",
    "[ fig.dfdt_vs_k ] , ) .",
    "thus , the actomyosin cortex is mechanosensitive by essence : its peculiar active viscoelastic nature , which arises from collective effects , provides a built - in system of adaptation to changes of the mechanical environment .",
    "llll    .5     &    .48     &    .95     &    .7       in microplate experiments , cells are observed to spread laterally simultaneously as they deflect microplates .",
    "these two processes both affect the arc distance between the cell adhesions on each plate ( fig .",
    "[ fig.shape ] ) .",
    "cell spreading is known to be mediated by actin treadmilling @xcite , which controls the extension of the lamellipodium @xcite .",
    "an effect of treadmilling is that there is a net flow of filamentous actin from the lamellipodial region into the proximal part of the actomyosin cytoskeleton , between adhesions @xcite , which persists even if the cell and its adhesions are immobile @xcite .",
    "thus the size of the cell is regulated by the combination of the myosin - driven contraction rate @xmath31 of the cytoskeleton ( the retrograde flow described above ) and the speed @xmath32 at which newly polymerised actin is incorporated into the cortex .",
    "this feature can be included in the model as a boundary condition , prescribing a difference @xmath32 between the speed of the cell edge and the one of the actin cortex close to the edge ( appendix  [ sup.one_d.treadmill ] and [ sup.three_d ] ) .",
    "we find that this reduces the maximum tension that the actomyosin network can develop , however the shape of the dependence versus the external stiffness @xmath24 is little altered ( fig .",
    "[ fig.rheo.plot ] ) .",
    "in particular , the force continues to be linearly dependent on @xmath24 for low stiffnesses , albeit with a reduced slope : this is a direct consequence of a mechanical regulation of cell height , which maintains the microplate deflection @xmath33 when @xmath24 varies , thus @xmath34 varies linearly with @xmath24 in this range .",
    "indeed , the equilibrium height of the cell is obtained in the classical situation when the polymerisation of actin at the cell edge is in balance with the retrograde flow which drives the actomyosin away from the cell edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig.rheo.equilibrium ] ) . however , the interpretation here is not that polymerisation generates this flow , but that myosin contraction is at its origin , and that the equilibrium height is reached when the force balance between myosin contraction and external forces acting on the cell is such that retrograde flow exactly balances polymerisation speed . in the case when they do not balance ,",
    "the cell edge will move at a speed which is the difference between the speed of polymerisation and the retrograde flow at the edge , until equilibrium is reached . in the case of our set - up",
    ", it is found that retrograde flow is initially faster than polymerisation , leading to a decrease of cell height , and , because of the resistance of the microplates to cell contraction , the tension @xmath27 increases . in turn , this higher tension reduces the retrograde flow until it is exactly equal and opposite to the polymerisation speed .",
    "treadmilling and myosin contraction thus work against one another , as has been noted for a long time @xcite and is specifically described by rossier et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "lll        &        &    .7     these phenomena regulate cell size . for low external force ,",
    "myosin - driven retrograde flow is high as the tension that opposes it is small , and the balance between retrograde flow and polymerisation speed is obtained when the cell has significantly reduced its height , @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig.f_vs_k ] .",
    "this height @xmath35 is thus a trade - off between the speed at which actin treadmilling produces new cortex @xmath32 ( appendix  [ sup.one_d ] ) and the rate of myosin - generated contractile strain @xmath36 , which is itself the result of the frictional resistance of crosslinkers to myosin contraction .",
    "indeed , in the one - dimensional toy problem , the equilibrium height of the system is @xmath37 for @xmath38 , and thus the force developed by the external spring is @xmath39 .",
    "in the three - dimensional full model of the cell cortex , this equilibrium height is slightly modified as a function of its geometry , but is still proportional to the product @xmath40 ( appendix  [ sup.three_d.equil ] ) .",
    "this equilibrium height is reached when the treadmilling speed balances exactly the speed at which myosin in the bulk contracts the boundaries of the existing cortex , via a retrograde flow that involves the whole of the cortex but is maximum in distal regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig.rheo.equilibrium ] ) .",
    "this type of competition between the protrusive contribution of actin polymerisation and the contractile contribution of myosin is of course noted in crawling cells @xcite , it is also observed in immobile cells where centripetal movement of actin monomers within filaments is noted even when adhesive structures are limited to a fixed location on a micropattern @xcite . thus , the cell - scale model and experiments allow to determine the speed of treadmilling , which is a molecular - scale quantity .",
    "we find @xmath41 nm / s in the 1d model , and @xmath42 nm / s for the 3d model , values which are in agreement with the literature @xcite , @xmath43 nm / s .",
    "the 1d model also allows to obtain the relaxation time of the crosslinked actomyosin network , @xmath44 s , consistent with elastic - like behaviour for frequencies higher than @xmath45 hz , the contractile characteristic time @xmath46 s , consistent with a @xmath47-minute completion of actin super - precipitation @xcite and @xmath48 nn , see appendix  [ sup.one_d.quanti ] . these values fit both the plateau ( @xmath49 ) force vs.  stiffness experimental results , fig .  [ fig.f_vs_k ] and the dynamics of the experiments , fig .",
    "[ fig.dfdt_vs_k ] . without further adjustment",
    ", they also allow to predict the dynamical adaptation of the loading rate of a cell between microplates of variable stiffness @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig.change_k ] , and to plot the force  velocity  height phase - portrait of the experiments , fig .",
    "[ fig.hill_values ] .    from an energetic point of view",
    ", it may seem very inefficient to use up energy for these two active phenomena that counterbalance one another .",
    "however , in a great number of physiological functions such as cytokinesis and motility , either or both of actin polymerisation and myosin contraction are crucial .",
    "it is therefore highly interesting that , combined together , they provide a spring - like behaviour to the cell while preserving its fluid nature , endowing it with the same resilience to sudden mechanical aggression as the passive mechanisms developed by some organisms , such as urinary - tract bacteria @xcite and insects @xcite .",
    "these antagonistic behaviours of polymerisation and myosin contractility entail energy losses , which define a range of force and velocity over which the actomyosin cytoskeleton is effective .",
    "the study of the energetic efficiency of animal muscle contraction was pioneered by a. v. hill @xcite , who determined a law relating force @xmath50 and speed of shortening @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are numerical values which depend on two values specific of a given muscle , namely a maximum force and a maximum speed , and a universal empirical constant .",
    "hill s law was then explained using a model based on the muscle molecular structure by a. f. huxley @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that a law of the same form describes the shortening and force generation of cells in the present setup @xcite .",
    "in particular , the maximum attainable force and velocity are due to energy losses .",
    "the model can shed light on the molecular origin of these losses , and leads to the quantitative force - velocity diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig.hill_values ] , .",
    "indeed , in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , eq .  *",
    "[ eq.cst ] * yields ( appendix  [ sup.hill ] ) :    @xmath56    here @xmath57 interprets an _ internal creep velocity_. the right - hand side corresponds to the source of power ( minus the internal elastic energy storage term @xmath58 ) , the left - hand side is the power usage ( up to a constant , @xmath59 , added to both sides ) .",
    "the formal similarity of this law with hill s law for muscles is not a surprise when one compares the present model with huxley s model of striated muscle contraction .",
    "indeed , the main components in both models are an elastic structure with transient attachments and an atp - fuelled ` pre - stretch ' of the basic elements of the systems which , upon release , generates either tension or contraction , or a combination of the two .",
    "treadmilling @xmath32 in our model superimposes an effect similar to the ones already present .",
    "it is easiest to understand this law in the extreme cases of zero speed or zero load , which correspond respectively to maximum contractile force and maximum contraction speed .",
    "the case of zero load , @xmath60 , corresponds to the highest velocity . in the case of muscle contraction , the fastest sliding of actin relative to myosin filaments",
    "is limited in huxley s model by the rate at which myosin heads detach after their stroke .",
    "this is because myosin heads which remain bound to actin will get entrained and exert an opposing force to the motion .",
    "this transient resistance is similar to friction . in our nonmuscle actomyosin model",
    ", crosslinkers also need to unbind so that the actomyosin network , which is elastic at short times , fluidises and flows .",
    "the velocity it reaches is thus a decreasing function of the relaxation time @xmath2 .",
    "zero speed , @xmath49 , corresponds to microplates of infinite stiffness .",
    "if in addition protrusion via actin treadmilling is blocked , @xmath61 , there is no net deformation of the network ( or sliding of the filaments in huxley s model ) , however energy is still being dissipated : indeed , myosin motors will still perform power strokes and generate tension in the network , but nearby crosslinkers and myosins themselves will also detach at the rate @xmath11 .",
    "this detachment will result in the local loss of the elastic energy that had been stored as tension of the network without resulting in a global deformation , corresponding to some _",
    "internal creep_. this time , the maximum force is an increasing function of relaxation time @xmath2 . in nonmuscle cells ,",
    "actin treadmilling is still present when the cell edge is immobile @xcite , and reduces the maximum force that can be attained , because part of the myosin power will be used to contract this newly formed cortex .    in the intermediate regimes where neither @xmath50 nor @xmath51 are zero",
    ", the term @xmath62 corresponds to an actual mechanical work performed against the external load , fig .",
    "[ fig.dissip ] .",
    "this work uses up the part of myosin energy that is not dissipated by internal creep , by effective friction or by working against the actin - driven edge protrusion .",
    "the model described here is based on a simple description of collective dynamics of actin and myosin that is consistent with observations at the protein scale @xcite , but does not include molecular sensitivity of the dynamics or actively driven reorganisation of the actomyosin cortex .",
    "we find that the linear rheological law that arises from this description allows to predict accurately the rigidity sensing experiments that we carry over two decades of external rigidity .",
    "the dynamics of cell pulling are also recovered , and we show that their similarity with the dynamics of muscle contraction @xcite are due to the parallelism that exists between actomyosin dynamics in nonmuscle cells and the dynamics of thin and thick filaments in muscle @xcite . because the model is based on the collective dynamics of myosin and actin filaments , it allows to understand their role in rigidity sensing : myosin provides a contractile stress @xmath26 which will in turn generate traction forces at the cell  substrate contact area . in cases when @xmath26 is in excess to these traction forces ( which resist cell contraction ) ,",
    "a retrograde flow is generated , the cell contracts and deforms its environment .",
    "this retrograde flow is limited by the time needed by the actin network to fluidise ( viscoelastic relaxation time @xmath2 ) , and is force - dependent .",
    "retrograde flow also works against actin protrusion at the cell edge : we hypothesise that this antagonism regulates cell shape , and show in the case of our parallel microplates setup that this regulation of cell height determines the rigidity sensing features of cells .",
    "the existence of a deformation set - point had already been speculated on micropillar array experiments @xcite and used as a hypothesis in modelling work @xcite , here we shed light on its relationship with molecular processes and retrograde flow . because the deformation set - point is obtained as a balance between protrusion and contraction , it is versatile and is likely to be tuned by the many pathways known to affect either of these .",
    "undoubtedly , it is a loss of energy for the cell to have such antagonistic mechanisms , which we quantify in fig .",
    "[ fig.dissip ] . however , the total power of myosin action that we calculate for a single cell is of the order of @xmath1 fw , which is less than one thousandth of the total power involved in cell metabolism @xcite .",
    "it is thus not surprising that this energy expense is not optimised in nonmuscle cells , as the evolutionary pressure on this cost can be deemed very low , while on the other hand the same structure confers to the cell its mechanical versatility and reactivity to abrupt mechanical challenges . in this , the cell may be likened to a wrestler ready to face a sudden struggle : the wrestler maintains a high muscle tone , having his own muscles work against one another . maintaining this muscular tone is an expense of energy , but the benefit of resisting assaults widely exceeds this cost .",

    "this allows us to neglect the role of microtubules compared to actomyosin tension and microplate resistance to bending in the modelling that follows .",

    "basic models of transiently crosslinked networks based on rubber - like models were first explored by green and tobolsky @xcite and yamamoto @xcite , and their nonlinear properties are still being investigated @xcite .",

    "the difference is that , for polymer solutions , the time @xmath2 is the ratio of solvent viscosity to polymer elasticity , because this is the characteristic time at which the polymers can deform relatively to an affine global deformation of their surroundings ( the solvent , @xcite ) , while , in the case of transiently crosslinked networks , @xmath2 is the characteristic unbinding time of the crosslinks .",
    "thus , the product @xmath12 which has the dimension of a viscosity is only some apparent viscosity at the macroscopic scale , and corresponds in fact to an elastic energy dissipation at rate @xmath11 .",

    "note that both characteristic times of crosslinker unbinding @xmath2 and of myosin power - stroke @xmath94 have been taken as constants , independent of the stress or strain they are submitted to .",
    "it is of course well established that there is a dependence of these parameters on stress and strain @xcite , which would introduce a nonlinearity in the model .",
    "an important , unsolved question is to determine whether these dependences are or not major players in the cell - scale mechanical behaviour of actomyosin , e.g. through a stress - driven ripping of crosslinks . as their effect is a nonlinear variation of the above model , the standard modelling procedure is to study the linear response first ( with constant characteristics times ) , before considering the full nonlinear model .",
    "it is found in the sequel that the linear model is sufficient to reproduce the experimental data , that is , for our experiments , collective effects explain the observed behaviour by themselves . in these conditions ,",
    "the effect of additional nonlinear terms could not be distinguished from this linear baseline , and were therefore not introduced in the present work .",
    "the model obtained is thus the one of a viscoelastic liquid .",

    "the actomyosin network is assumed to occupy an infinite cuboid between two horizontal plates , one of which is fixed and the vertical position of the other governed by a spring of stiffness @xmath95 ( per unit area ) and equilibrium distance with the other plate @xmath22 . if the current distance between the plates is @xmath96 , the force exerted by the top plate on the material is thus @xmath97 per unit area .",
    "we assume that the bulk forces acting on the actomyosin network ( such as the friction with the cytosol ) are negligible compared to the force developed by myosin contraction , this writes : @xmath98 with the boundary condition @xmath99 at the upper plate ; and corresponds to neglecting friction with the cytosolic fluid in the balance between the actomyosin stress and the force at the plates . by symmetry ,",
    "only the vertical component @xmath100 of the stress tensor @xmath6 in the actomyosin material is nonzero , we denote it @xmath101 , from the above we have @xmath102 and thus the boundary condition imposes @xmath103 at every @xmath104 , the stress is fully transmitted through the material .    on the other hand ,",
    "the rate - of - strain tensor @xmath4 is also limited to a vertical component @xmath105 . using these equalities , the constitutive eq .  *",
    "[ eq.cst ] * describes the complete dynamics of the system .",
    "in particular , a permanent regime ( @xmath106=0 , @xmath107 ) is reached for @xmath108 for @xmath21 , with @xmath109 .",
    "the actomyosin model s response is thus very close to the behaviour of a spring of stiffness @xmath25 and free length @xmath110 , when put in series with an external spring of stiffness @xmath24 : indeed , the asymptotes are the same for @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.rheo.plot ] ) , which is not obvious since in the permanent regime the model only includes viscous dissipation and contractility .",
    "we have thus shown that _",
    "a contractile fluid behaves like a spring _ in these conditions .",
    "indeed , when the cell is pulling on a spring of stiffness @xmath24 , the maximum deflection it can impose to the spring is @xmath22 , e. g. the initial cell height and , consequently , the maximum height it can shorten .",
    "however , this maximum deflection is achieved only if the maximum force generated by the cell @xmath113 is larger than the external spring force at maximum deflexion @xmath114 , in other words only if @xmath24 is lower than @xmath20 . in that case , the force reached is @xmath114 , thus proportional to @xmath24 . in the other case @xmath115 ,",
    "the deflection is less than @xmath22 and is set by having an equal tension @xmath113 in both the external equivalent spring @xmath24 and the cell .",
    "we now introduce the fact that actin filaments _ in vivo _ are constantly being polymerised from one end ( ` plus ' end ) and depolymerised , mostly from the other ( ` minus ' end ) , which results in the so - called treadmilling phenomenon @xcite . assuming that this treadmilling is at steady - state in the cell on average at the relevant time scale of our experiment , the effect of treadmilling in the bulk does not affect the modelling assumptions done in appendix  [ sup.model ] : the elastic modulus @xmath8 of the crosslinked network at any instant will have a constant average .",
    "however , at the boundary , some filaments will have their ` plus ' end oriented towards the boundary and thus polymerisation of these will entail a net extension of the material ( before stress equilibration , depending on the boundary conditions ) .    in the framework of our one dimensional toy problem ,",
    "this introduces a drift between the deformation of the material and the displacement of the boundary , which can be expressed as : @xmath116 with @xmath117 the treadmilling speed , that is , the extra length added by a monomer polymerising divided by the characteristic time for an atp - fuelled monomer addition .",
    "the factor @xmath118 is due to this effect taking place at both plates .",
    "when injected into the constitutive model , this modifies the level of force ( and height @xmath119 ) in the permanent regime : @xmath120 with a modified critical stiffness @xmath121 . here",
    "@xmath122 is a characteristic _ elastic length _ of newly polymerised material .",
    "the critical stiffness @xmath25 is lowered in proportion with the corresponding relative increase of height .",
    "we have also introduced another new parameter , the length @xmath123 .",
    "this length is discussed in the main text , it is a trade - off between the rate at which actin contracts under the effect of myosin , and the speed at which actin network expands by polymerisation at its edges .",
    "it defines the shortest height that the cell achieves in the 1d model , when the stiffness of the plates is vanishingly small : in that case , all of the work of myosins is spent in contracting the part of actin network newly polymerised .",
    "for a low stiffness , this expression has for asymptote @xmath124 , and for a large stiffness , @xmath125 this does not change the qualitative spring - like response of the material , only the equilibrium length of the equivalent spring is not zero anymore but @xmath35 .",
    "this means that as the device stiffness goes to zero , the height of the model meshwork will tend to @xmath126 , which is a dynamic balance between the speed @xmath127 at which new material is added at the two boundaries ( modelling polymerisation ) , and the rate @xmath128 at which the existing material is contracted by the myosin motors . inside this model material , even once the final length @xmath35 is reached and the boundaries are immobile , there remains a continuous centripetal flow ( fig .",
    "[ fig.atef.sketch ] ) that is very reminiscent of the retrograde actin flow observed in both crawling @xcite and immobile spread cells @xcite .",
    "exactly as in these cases , this is made possible by depolymerisation inside the model material .",
    "this is an additional source of energy dissipation in steady state , when the cell is apparently at equilibrium with constant length @xmath35 and force @xmath129 .",
    "the above constitutive and force balance equations can be written in terms of one equation only with the tension as the unknown , @xmath130 one can analyse the rate of tension increase when the system begins to pull and @xmath101 is still much smaller than @xmath26 , for a low stiffness @xmath131 , @xmath132 and for high stiffness @xmath133 , @xmath134    experiments for very low values of the microplate stiffness @xmath24 allow to identify the parameters @xmath135 and @xmath32 of the model .    from @xmath77 experiments with @xmath136",
    "nn/@xmath65 , we find @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath139 in @xcite .",
    "additionally , the maximum force attained @xmath129 , the current force @xmath140 and the rate of growth of this force @xmath141 allow to calculate @xmath135 using eq .  *",

    "we can thus write the following relations , ensured by the experimental setup : @xmath144 @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the variation of force around the force at time @xmath143 , @xmath147 .    changing",
    "only the stiffness in this manner ensures that the cell does not feel any step - change : indeed , force and geometry are preserved , the only change is the _ response of the microdevice to a variation of the force applied to it_. the experimental result is that , despite the fact that none of the physical observables have been changed for the cell , its rate of loading @xmath141 of the device is instantaneously modified . in @xcite , it is found that , when going from a stiffness @xmath148 to a stiffness @xmath149 , the new rate of loading matches the rate of loading that the same cell type exhibits in a constant stiffness @xmath150 experiment , at a time such that @xmath151 . in @xcite , this experiment is repeated with another cell type and it is also found that the rate of loading is instantaneously changed .",
    "however , the value @xmath141 for @xmath152 exhibits an overshoot : it is initially different from the value of the corresponding constant stiffness experiment , and exhibits a relaxation towards it",
    ".    we can rewrite eq .  *",
    "[ eq.dzetdt ] * around @xmath153 , we find : @xmath154 the result is thus a step - function , whose value for @xmath152 is exactly the rate of growth predicted by the model for a constant stiffness experiment with @xmath150 .",
    "this corresponds to the experimental results in both @xcite and @xcite , except for the overshoot found in the latter .",
    "the step - change of the rate of loading can thus be explained by a purely intrinsic property of the cell s cytoskeleton , as developed in the main text .    in @xcite ,",
    "a model is proposed that accounts for a step - change and relaxation , as they observe experimentally .",
    "however this model has a limited validity around @xmath143 and breaks down at long times , predicting infinite force . here , our model originally aiming at describing the long - time behaviour of the cell depending on stiffness predicts the main feature of the experiments ( the step - change of the rate of loading ) , but not the overshoot found in one of the experiments .",
    "our model however may produce this type of overshoot if more than a single relaxation time is used .",
    "this would correspond to replacing the spring @xmath149 in the model in @xcite by our viscoelastic constitutive equation .",
    "this is found not to be necessary to explain the data studied here .    in fig .",

    "the time - profile of the microplate effective stiffness is imposed to be the same in the numerical simulation as in the experiment .",

    ", the mechanical equilibrium of the sample imposes that the vertical component of the stress tensor @xmath101 is equal to @xmath158 . also , the treadmilling produces a mismatch between the plate velocity @xmath159 and the recoil of the existing network at the plate @xmath160 , expressed by @xmath161 ( see eq .  *",

    "when the velocity @xmath51 is zero , the force generated is finite as calculated above , eq .  * [ eq.plateau.fmax ] * , which can also write : @xmath166 even if both @xmath51 and @xmath32 are zero , and thus the actomyosin does not contract macroscopically ( @xmath167 ) , the force generated remains finite since it does work at a molecular scale .",
    "actin polymerisation , by adding new material at the edges , introduces a ` boundary creep ' , which consumes additional work in conditions of fixed length ( @xmath49 ) .    as stated in the main text , apart from the polymerisation ` boundary",
    "creep ' , this is the same dissipative mechanism as in the model of muscle contraction by huxley @xcite . in this model ,",
    "myosin ` elastic tails ' are prestretched preferentially in one direction before binding the actin thin filament .",
    "when there is no net sliding ( @xmath49 ) , they eventually unbind without having had the opportunity to provide work , that is , they have conserved this level of stretching .",
    "although this is not explicitly written in the 1957 paper , the prestretch that had been bestowed on the myosin ` elastic tail ' is thus lost .",
    "zero force @xmath60 condition is a ( theoretical ) limit corresponding to zero - stiffness of the microplate .",
    "this is not attainable experimentally , as cells do not spread on both plates if their displacement does not generate any external force  which corresponds to the impossibility to apply any normal force to the plates .",
    "this effect probably has to do with the mechanism of force reinforcement of adhesions . in the model",
    "however , the limit can be studied , and yields a maximum velocity , @xmath168 this corresponds to the power injected by the myosin motors , divided by the elastic modulus of the crosslinked network ( minus the treadmilling contribution ) : indeed , in this limit , the myosins work against the elasticity of the actomyosin itself .",
    "the maximum velocity is thus limited by the rate @xmath2 at which the actin network fluidises thanks to the detachment of crosslinkers . in comparison to the case of muscles ,",
    "actin treadmilling reduces the maximum speed of shortening by @xmath127 , as the receding speed of the edge of the actin network must compensate for this speed of protrusion .",
    "quantitatively , using the values obtained in appendix  [ sup.one_d.dyn ] , we predict @xmath169 nm / s , this is very close to @xmath170 nm / s published in @xcite .",
    "again , the dissipation here is of the same nature as for muscles in the model by huxley : in his case , the only crosslinker between thin and thick filaments are myosin heads , and zero force is obtained at the finite velocity at which the work rate performed by pulling myosin heads is exactly balanced by the work rate needed to deform myosin heads that have not yet detached from the actin filament .",
    "they will eventually detach , thus dissipating at a fixed rate the elastic energy that has been transferred to them .",
    "when neither @xmath50 nor @xmath51 are zero , there is a nonzero productive work performed on the plates . because of the existence of maximum force and velocity , it is necessarily written @xmath171 in both the experiments by a. v. hill @xcite and ours @xcite , @xmath172 is found to be mostly independent of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath173 . in huxley s model of muscles , @xmath172 is a signature of the preferential pre - stretch of myosins that models the power - stroke , normalised by the detachment rate @xcite . in our model of cells , @xmath174 is the ratio of the characteristic times of contraction and of stress relaxation through crosslinker unbinding .",
    "this does not explain the coincidence of finding the same value of @xmath172 in both cells and muscles , however we note that this parameter has a similar signification in both models .",
