    "the relationship between the dust and gas in a molecular cloud is crucial in understanding the cloud properties and the star formation activities therein .",
    "dust provides the most reliable and useful tracer of the total gas column density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while molecules like and are more useful as tracers of the local physical and chemical conditions ( e.g. , gas temperatures and velocities , co column densities , etc . ) a comparison between them allows us to probe the variation of molecular gas abundances , i.e. , [ ] and [ ] ( [ molecule ] @xmath12 n(molecule)/n(h ) where n is column density ) , caused by such factors as photodissociation and chemical depletion / desorption in cold / warm environments .",
    "this helps to reveal the physical and chemical properties of the molecular cloud , which enables us to better understand the initial conditions of star formation and its potential dependence on such factors as cloud chemistry and structure .",
    "such variations have been noted in previous observations of a variety of gmcs , including perseus @xcite , taurus @xcite , and orion @xcite , made at relatively high spatial resolutions ( 0.2 - 0.4 pc ) .",
    "here we report the results of a combined co - dust extinction study of the california molecular cloud ( cmc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at even higher spatial resolution ( @xmath0 0.04 pc ) in order to investigate in more detail the relation between co gas and dust in this interesting nearby gmc .",
    "the cmc is a useful laboratory for such studies . in particular",
    ", it contains a massive filamentary structure in its southeast region that consists of both cold molecular gas with little star formation activity and hot molecular gas associated with an active star forming region containing the massive star lkh@xmath13 101 and its accompanying embedded cluster .",
    "this provides a physical environment with large temperature and density variations that are interesting to explore .",
    "indeed , as reported in @xcite , the cmc overall shows an order of magnitude lower star formation rate ( sfr ) than the orion molecular cloud , even though these equally distant gmcs have similar mass , size , and morphology .",
    "recently , also found the clumps in the cmc to be characterized by similar kinematic states as those in orion .",
    "@xcite proposed that the difference in sfrs between the two clouds was a result of a difference in cloud structure , specifically the amount of dense gas in each cloud .",
    "moreover , this close connection between dense gas mass and the sfr appears to be a general physical property of galactic gmcs @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to compare other properties of the cmc with similar ones in the orion cloud to look for additional factors , such as cloud chemistry for example , that could contribute to the difference in the sfr between the two clouds .",
    "a combined co - extinction study can also be used to investigate the co x - factor ( @xmath12 n(h@xmath14)/w@xmath15 , where w is integrated intensity ) which is widely used to derive molecular cloud masses from the co(1 - 0 ) line flux , especially in external galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite being very optically thick , this co rotational transition is still thought to be a good tracer for the total molecular gas mass , due to the effect of photon transport in gas with large velocity gradients .",
    "however , variations of physical conditions can have an effect on the x - factor and , in many instances , render its application rather uncertain .",
    "apparently , there is no universally valid x - factor ( see recent review from * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , investigating the dependence of the x - factor on differing physical conditions is clearly of great interest in establishing practical guidelines for its application .",
    "combined co - extinction studies of nearby clouds can therefore provide potentially important insights into this issue .    in this paper",
    ", we present observational results of molecular lines ( 2 - 1 ) , ( 2 - 1 ) , and ( 2 - 1 ) .",
    "the total gas mass ( or n@xmath16 ) is traced by extinction derived from nir observations , independent from the molecular lines . the area covered in our observation is mainly dense gas with @xmath10 3 mag . with the nicest technique , we are able to trace extinction up to @xmath0 33 mag , which is much deeper than achieved in a similar study of orion by @xcite who used the nicer technique to trace extinction depths up to @xmath0 15 mag",
    ". we also observed the optically thinner ( 2 - 1 ) line , which provides insights into co chemistry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that can not be readily derived using only and observations .    in the following ,",

    "these branches likely mark two limiting extremes of spatially dependent variation in the chemical conditions within the cmc .    spatial variations in abundances have been reported previously in a few other molecular clouds , although in these clouds the variations appear less pronounced than found here . for the perseus molecular cloud , @xcite found generally tighter correlations of column density with extinction than found here , although they explored the correlation at much lower extinctions ( i.e. , @xmath1 10 mag ) than in this study .",

    "further , @xcite were able to associate these positional variations in abundance with positional variations in the physical conditions within the cloud .",
    "at the lowest extinctions ( @xmath1 3 mag ) , where there is not enough to self - shield against uv dissociation , they found extremely low abundances with significant ( factor of 8) spatial variations . at intermediate extinctions ( 3 @xmath1 @xmath1 10 mag ) , where self - shielding is considerably more effective , higher abundances were found with modest ( factor of 2 ) spatial variations . at the highest extinctions they observed the highest abundances but also the largest spatial variations in abundances across the cloud .",
    "this latter regime included cold portions of the cloud where co depletion depressed the abundances as well as hot regions heated by young stars where co desorption produced enhanced co abundances .",
    "the molecular abundance is regulated by the physical and chemical conditions in the gmc .",

    "[ fig : noverav ] we plot the relation between ( a ) and ( b ) abundance and extinction in the cmc .",
    "although there is a large scatter in both relations , it is clear that the abundances of the two species decline with extinction in a manner consistent with similar abundance reductions seen in other molecular clouds and suggestive of co freeze out onto grain surfaces in the interior regions of the cloud .",
    "if this decline in abundances at high extinctions is due to freeze out , we also expect the reduction of the gas - phase abundances to be occurring in the coldest regions of the cloud . in figure",
    "[ fig : noverav ] the points are color - coded by the gas temperature and we see both a preponderance of cold gas in the cloud , and a prominent decrease in abundance with extinction for the cold pixels , while the warm pixels show no decrease .",

    "this is consistent with the reduction of co abundance we observe in the cold , high extinction regions in the cmc .    at the higher gas temperatures ( t @xmath10 17 k ) we would expect that thermal evaporation ( desorption ) of the gas from the grain surfaces releases any trapped co and increases its gas phase abundance relative to the cold regions of the cloud .",
    "indeed , that is what is clearly shown in figure [ fig : abuntex ] where the observed abundances increase with increasing gas temperature .",
    "the warmest co gas in our surveyed region is found in four contiguous tiles ( 11 - 14 ) that are in close proximity to the massive star lkh@xmath13 101 and its associated cluster ( shown as the blue circle in figure [ fig : texmap ] ) .",
    "the cmc dust temperature map from @xcite ( see their figure 4 ) shows a vast region of high dust temperature ( @xmath0 28 k ) near lkh@xmath13 101 , which coincides with the positions of tiles 11 - 14 in our observation .",
    "it is in this warm area that the co abundances appear to be at their highest .",

    "the abundance enhancement near lkh@xmath13 101 is likely caused by hot dust heated by the cluster .",
    "over most of the rest of the cloud @xcite find @xmath0 10 - 14 k. in these regions the gas temperatures are also found to be near 10 k and a significant amount of co should be locked in ice mantles on the dust grains at least at the highest extinctions ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "these considerations suggest that the variation of [ ] and [ ] in the cmc is mostly regulated by the chemistry of depletion and desorption which in turn is driven by the ( dust ) temperature distribution .",
    "recently , @xcite have reported similar results for the orion a molecular cloud .",
    "they divided that cloud into 9 spatial partitions ( 1 - 9 ) and considered regions within those partitions with extinctions , @xmath10 5 magnitudes , similar to those studied here for the cmc .",
    "they found that in regions with 5 @xmath1 @xmath1 10 magnitudes , was generally linearly correlated with .",
    "however , in those partitions ( 2 , 3 & 4 ) that also contained higher extinction material and were characterized by mean gas excitation temperatures that were below @xmath0 22 k , the -relation became flat above @xmath53 10 magnitudes . on the other hand , in two partitions ( 5 & 6 ) with both high extinctions and",

    "our results for the cmc are certainly consistent with those of @xcite for orion a. in this respect , the physical / chemical conditions in the orion and the cmc appear to be quite similar .",
    "the spatial variations in abundances of the rarer isotopes of co are largely determined by depletion / desorption effects due to spatial variations in dust ( and gas ) temperatures resulting from localized star formation activity within the clouds .",
    "in the outer , lower extinction regions of molecular clouds , fuv radiation is expected to play a role in cloud chemistry . in low extinction regions",
    "( i.e. , @xmath1 3 mag ) fractionation of can increase its abundance relative to . at somewhat higher extinctions ( @xmath1 5 mag ) selective photodissociation of is likely to occur due to differences in self - shielding of the fuv intensity at the dissociation wavelengths for the various co isotopes .",
    "the more abundant and isotopes are effectively self - shielded at relatively low extinctions ( @xmath1 1 magnitudes ) but because the dissociation wavelength of is slightly shifted compared to and , and its abundance is relatively low so it is not as effectively self - shielded as the main isotopes , fuv radiation can penetrate deeper into the cloud and dissociate the . since our surveys cover relatively high extinction regions ( @xmath10 5 mag ) we would not necessarily expect selective photodissociation to strongly effect the to abundance ratios . however , earlier studies of @xcite and @xcite suggest that the effects of selective photodissociation may be present at much higher extinctions .    in figure [",
    "fig : w1318 ] we plot the ratio of integrated intensities , w()/w ( ) , as a function of extinction .",
    "this ratio is proportional to the abundance ratio for the two species for optically thin lines .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for a solar abundance and optically thin lines",
    ", the ratio should be equal to about 5.5 and one would expect the points to scatter around this value , independent of extinction , provided the cloud is characterized by a constant relative abundance throughout and that the excitation of the two species is not too different .",
    "although at lower extinctions ( @xmath1 15 magnitudes ) there indeed appears to be no obvious correlation between this ratio and extinction , the observed values scatter over an enormous range ( @xmath53 0 - 40 ) .",
    "the highest values of the ratio exceed the solar value by nearly an order of magnitude level . to reduce the scatter in the plot due to non - detections of we set the integrated intensity equal to 2 @xmath49 for those pixels where w ( ) is below 2 @xmath49 .",
    "we represent the resulting lower limits on the calculated ratio as triangles in the plot ( see figure ) . ] .",
    "in contrast , at high extinctions ( @xmath10 15 magnitudes ) the relation is relatively flat with a relatively low dispersion , as might be expected for a constant abundance ratio , and is centered at a value ( approximately 4.5 ) near but somewhat less than the solar value .",
    "this behavior does not appear to depend on gas temperature ( see figure ) and thus is not likely a result of depletion or desorption processes on grains .",
    "it is more likely indicative of an active chemical processing of by fuv radiation in regions where @xmath1 15 magnitudes .",
    "the scatter in figure [ fig : w1318 ] is so large at these extinctions because the relative abundance of and is highly unstable possibly due to the stochastic variations in fuv flux resulting , in turn , from such factors as the cloud structure and geometry and nature of the external radiation field .    in figure",
    "[ fig : w1318map ] we show a map of the distribution of the integrated intensity ratio over the southern portion of the cmc . examination of this map shows systematically increasing values of the integrated intensity ratio at the edges of the cloud with the material nearest the star lkh@xmath13 101 exhibiting the largest center to edge increases in the ratio .",

    "moreover they also found the variations in this ratio to be linked to variations in the external fuv radiation field .    in the inner , higher extinction regions of the cmc , where fuv photons can not penetrate ,",
    "the abundances are more chemically stable and apparently somewhat below the solar value .",
    "our observations do indicate , however , that fuv photons are present at relatively large ( projected ) depths ( @xmath0 15 magnitudes ) in the cloud confirming results from earlier studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we now address the earlier observation that the relations between the co abundances and temperature ( figure [ fig : abuntex ] ) show positive correlations but over different temperature ranges .",
    "one might have expected both and molecules to show abundances that increased with temperature over similar temperature ranges , since their binding energies are very similar .",
    "however , the difference may result from the effects of selective uv dissociation of .    in the cmc we also find to be correlated with in regions where warm gas is present .",
    "figure [ fig : texavhot ] displays the relation between and for the warm tiles ( 11 - 13 ) in our map .",
    "although the scatter is large at high , there is no doubt of a strong trend between the two quantities with @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly in this region the temperature reaches the co sublimation temperature at roughly @xmath4 6 - 7 magnitudes .",
    "therefore it is possible that , even though is being evaporated from grains at @xmath10 6 magnitudes , ( where @xmath10 17 k ) it is also being selectively photodissociated by deeply penetrating uv radiation until depths of @xmath0 15 magnitudes . for larger values of , dust absorption effectively removes the dissociating uv radiation and higher gas ( dust ) temperatures associated with this region liberate more from grain surfaces .",
    "indeed , the abundances at these higher extinctions and temperatures may reach levels that also allow some self - shielding . consequently , does not reach the expected levels of increased abundance due to evaporation from grains until cloud depths are sufficient to shield the molecule from uv radiation . because of its higher abundance , self - shields at much lower cloud depths and the effects of its increased abundance , due to evaporation from grains , are observed at lower extinctions ( and corresponding lower temperatures ) than .      even though h@xmath14 is the dominant constituent of molecular clouds , emission is the most accessible tracer of such gas in the ism .",
    "it is often the only molecular tracer that can be readily detected in distant clouds and galaxies and consequently has been used to estimate the mass of the molecular component of the ism in these systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to make such estimations requires knowledge of the so - called x - factor , that is , the co conversion factor , @xmath86 the standard determination of this factor is via use of virial theorem techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "traditionally this is accomplished by measuring the slope of the correlation between the two quantities at low extinctions ( @xmath2 5 mag ) where the co appears to be effectively thin .",
    "we adopt a slightly different approach and use all our observations to compute a global or average x - factor for the cmc cloud , that is , @xmath2@xmath87@xmath3 = @xmath2@xmath88@xmath3/@xmath2@xmath89@xmath3 @xmath4 2.53@xmath510@xmath6 @xmath74 ( k km s@xmath35)@xmath35 .",

    "w@xmath92 has no dependence on @xmath61 or column density , but it is proportional to , the gas excitation temperature .    particularly interesting in this regard is the behavior of w@xmath92 in tile 13 near where the embedded cluster is heating the cloud . here , there appears to be a clear linear relation between w@xmath92 and to the highest measured extinctions ( @xmath53 25 magnitudes ) despite the fact that the emission in this region of the cloud is so saturated that it is self - reversed ( see figure [ fig : spec ] ) . because the co emission is so optically thick , this behavior must be primarily the result of the gradient of with observed in this region of the cloud ( see figure [ fig : texavhot ] ) .",
    "this is also evident in figure [ fig : wav12tile13 ] which shows an expanded view of the w@xmath92relation for tile 13 .",
    "we can clearly see a temperature gradient in the distribution of color - coded points from low to high . both w(co ) and t increase by a factor of @xmath0 5 - 6 from low to high .",
    "this indicates that the temperature gradient accounts for the bulk of the change in w(co ) with in this region .",
    "of course , other factors could contribute to the increase in w(co ) such as an increase in velocity dispersion with temperature , or even increased [ co ] due to desorption as with and as discussed previously .",
    "we do find some evidence for a marginal ( 35% ) increase in the velocity dispersion of the hot gas , but its magnitude is far from sufficient to account for the increased ( @xmath100 ) measures of w(co ) .",
    "a desorption induced increase in co abundance most certainly has occurred in the hot gas , and although the line is very optically thick , we might expect that additional photons could leak out in the line wings and possibly increase the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "but as we already remarked , this effect can not be significant since the change in peak brightness is observed to be comparable to the change in w(co ) and substantially larger than changes in the velocity dispersion .",
    "consequently , in the set of tiles near the massive star lkh@xmath13 101 ( 11 - 14 ) we conclude that heating of co enhances w@xmath92 in a manner that induces a positive correlation with extinction despite the fact that the emission is saturated .",
    "these observations suggest that heating by ob stars produces gradients in the excitation temperature of the co emitting gas such that in warm regions w ( ) is proportional to and thus to n(h@xmath14 ) over a wide range of extinctions .",
    "this , in turn , indicates that a single , meaningful x - factor can be derived for these hotter regions using the observations . in figure",
    "[ fig : twav12 ] , tile 13 shows the best correlation between w ( ) and .",
    "we performed a linear regression for tile 13 , which is shown in figure [ fig : wav12tile13 ] .",
    "our result implies @xmath101 in this tile over the range 3 mag @xmath2 @xmath2 25 mag . from the average of the individual , on - the - spot , values in tile 13 we find @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath102 , in excellent agreement with the value derived from the linear regression",
    "this clearly supports the idea of a constant value in the hot gas . the derived value is less than both that found for the global average of the cmc and the value ( @xmath103 ) usually adopted for the milky way .",
    "this result would suggest that in regions heated by ob stars ( e.g. , as hii regions , extragalactic starbursts , etc . ) , reasonably accurate gas masses could be derived using a standard x - factor analysis with a single value of the x - factor .",
    "unfortunately it is not at all clear how one would predict the appropriate value to use in all situations .",
    "however some clues may be found in the analysis of the regions away from ob stars , where there is only ambient heating of the gas from cosmic rays and the general galactic uv radiation field .",
    "here we observe no correlation between w@xmath92 and at modest to high extinctions ( i.e. , @xmath10 3 - 5 mag ) .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact the line is almost always saturated at high extinctions and the cold gas is very nearly isothermal .",
    "consequently , these cold , quiescent regions , are not characterized by a single empirical x - factor , instead , the x - factor systematically increases with extinction and , in the cmc , is almost always larger than the milky way value .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : xcovsav]a where we plot the relation between the on - the - spot x - factor and for the regions of the cloud not heated by the cluster ( i.e. , tiles 1 - 10 and 15 - 17 ) .",
    "as expected there is a clear correlation and a linear least - squares fit to the unbinned data finds that @xmath8 n(h@xmath14)@xmath104 . for the cold tiles we find @xmath2@xmath3 = 3.4 @xmath5 10@xmath6  @xmath7 .",
    "the ( constant ) x - factor in the hotter regions ( e.g. , tile 13 ) has a value considerably lower than those in the cold regions , suggesting that may also increase with decreasing gas temperature within the cloud .",
    "such a trend is clearly evident in our observations and is shown in figure [ fig : xcovsav]b where we plot the relation between the on - the - spot and for the entire cloud .",
    "a linear least - square fit to the ( binned ) data gives , @xmath4 2.0 @xmath5 10@xmath6(/10)@xmath11  @xmath7 .",
    "in this instance we chose to fit the binned data to give greater weight to high temperature measurements .",
    "a fit to the unbinned data gives a slightly steeper slope ( -0.9 vs. -0.7 ) .",
    "the observed inverse correlation between and is potentially interesting .",
    "it suggests that differences between globally averaged x - factors derived for different clouds could be a result of variations in the relative amounts of hot and cold gas within the clouds , provided their velocity dispersions are similar .",
    "active star forming clouds with ob stars and hii regions , such as orion , might be expected to have average x - factors that are lower than more quiescent clouds , such as the cmc .",
    "indeed , @xcite derive @xmath4 1.35 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 for the entire orion complex from @xmath105 ray data , in agreement with recent determinations using co @xcite",
    ". moreover , @xmath105 ray observations of orion with the fermi satellite by @xcite found that in the ( cold ) regions removed from the ob stars and hii regions , @xmath4 2.2 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 , while in the ( hotter ) parts of the cloud complex associated with the hii regions , @xmath4 1.3 @xmath5 10@xmath6  @xmath7 , very similar to what we find in the california cloud . for the taurus cloud , which has no ob stars or hii regions , @xcite find = 2.1 @xmath5 10@xmath6  @xmath7 from co observations of that cloud . a relatively high value ( 2.54 @xmath5 10@xmath6  @xmath7 ) for was also derived from planck observations of high latitude diffuse and presumably cold , co gas .",
    "we noted earlier that the global x - factor for the cmc was 25% higher than the milky way value and this is may be due to the relatively large tracts of cold regions included in the average for the cmc .",
    "of course , variations in velocity dispersions between clouds could also contribute to the variation in their observed x - factors .",
    "however , we would expect similar velocity dispersions to characterize gravitationally bound or virialized clouds of similar mass and size .",
    "moreover , since the average column densities of molecular clouds are also constant , we would expect @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath0 @xmath2t@xmath106 for such clouds .",
    "as recently pointed out by @xcite , galactic gmcs are characterized by very similar physical properties resulting in x - factors that span a relatively narrow range of values .",
    "they suggest that this is a result of the competition between stellar feedback and gravity that is necessary to maintain the relative stability of these objects . here",
    "we are suggesting that variation within that narrow range of observed may be due to variations in the relative fractions of hot gas in these clouds .",
    "this hot gas , of course , is a direct product of the amount of stellar feedback the clouds are experiencing .",
    "resolved maps of the internal x - factor distribution in additional clouds would be useful to determine the relative contribution of temperature to the derived values of within gmcs in general and could directly test this idea .",
    "absent of such additional data , it is instructive to compare our observations to recent simulations of turbulent cloud evolution that resolve synthetic clouds and derive the internal spatial distribution of the x - factor @xcite .",
    "these simulations are thus directly comparable to observations such as ours . the shetty et al .",
    "simulations include chemical evolution and radiative transfer to enable predictions of co line emission",
    ". however , the calculations do not include gas - dust chemical interactions and are thus not relevant to our earlier findings or discussion regarding [ ] , [ ] , and w()/w ( ) .",
    "but since is so optically thick we safely assume that effects of depletion / desorption are not important for our x - factor determinations and thus comparisons with these models are appropriate . because the shetty et al .",
    "simulations do not incorporate stellar feedback , the most appropriate comparison will be with our data in the regions of the cmc away from the embedded cluster ( all tiles excluding 11 - 14 ) .",
    "the simulated cloud of @xcite whose physical conditions match most closely those of typical gmcs is characterized by a global lower than we observe in the cold tiles of the cmc map ( 2.2 vs. 3.4 @xmath5 10@xmath107 ) but closer to the milky way value . on sub - cloud scales",
    "@xcite find a correlation between and ( see their figure 4 ) similar to but somewhat weaker than we observe in the cmc .",
    "the simulations also predict that there should be a correlation between the x - factor and the velocity dispersion in the cloud , with @xmath8 @xmath108 . in figure",
    "[ fig : xcovssigma ] we plot against the velocity dispersion , @xmath109 in the cold cloud regions is the second moment of the ( 2 - 1 ) profile @xmath110 where m1 is the first moment @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath109 equals the velocity dispersion if line profile is gaussian . ] .",
    "we find no correlation between these same quantities contrary to the predictions of the simulation .",
    "although the simulations of individual clouds do not include any systematic temperature gradients or increases due to stellar heating , simulations were performed to investigate how increasing the overall cloud temperature can effect .",
    "these simulations predict a trend of decreasing x with t , consistent with what we observe here .",
    "the simulations find @xmath8 t@xmath112 for different temperature clouds which is only somewhat weaker than what is observed here , i.e. , @xmath8 t@xmath11 within the cmc .",
    "overall , we conclude that the agreement between these simulations and the cmc is mixed and it is unclear whether any similarities between the simulations and the observations of the california cloud are more than coincidental .",
    "in this study we presented the results of extinction and molecular - line mapping toward the most active star forming region within the nearby california gmc . the relationship between dust and gas properties in this active portion of the cloud",
    "was investigated with the following results :    \\1 .",
    "the lte molecular abundances of and in the cloud exhibit significant spatial variations .",
    "these variations are correlated with the spatial variation in gas ( and presumably dust ) temperature in the cloud .",
    "these temperature variations are likely caused by the heating from the adjacent , partially embedded , lkh@xmath13 101 cluster .",
    "we argue that the spatial variations in the derived and gas abundances are largely due to temperature dependent gas depletion / desorption on / off dust grains .",
    "the abundance ratio between and increases in lower extinction regions of the california cloud , suggesting selective photo - dissociation of in those regions .",
    "this is likely caused by ambient uv radiation which apparently penetrates relatively deeply ( i.e. , @xmath1 15 mag ) into the cloud , particularly near the embedded cluster .",
    "there is also evidence that the selective photo - dissociation of can suppress its abundance even in warm regions heated by the embedded cluster where evaporation off grain surfaces would otherwise lead to an increase in the abundance at these cloud depths .",
    "dramatic spatial variations are also observed in the relationship between the integrated intensity , w@xmath92 , and , particularly at the intermediate and high extinctions ( @xmath10 3 - 5 mag ) primarily probed in this study .",
    "however , unlike the case for its two rarer isotopologues , the variation in integrated intensity appears to be a direct result of a spatial gradient of the excitation temperature ( and gas kinetic temperature ) with extinction and not the result of any detectable variation in the abundance due to depletion / desorption effects .",
    "we compute the x - factor ( @xmath4n(h@xmath14)/w(co ) ) for each individual pixel in our map and average the results to obtain @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 2.53 @xmath5 10@xmath6  @xmath7 , a value somewhat higher than the milky way average .    \\5 . on the sub - parsec scales in the cmc",
    "there is no single empirical value of the x - factor that can characterize the molecular gas in cold ( @xmath1 15 k ) regions with @xmath10 3 magnitudes . for those regions we find that @xmath8 a@xmath113 with @xmath2@xmath3 @xmath4 3.4 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "we do however find a clear correlation between w ( ) and in regions containing relatively hot ( @xmath10 25 k ) molecular gas at @xmath10 3 magnitudes suggesting that , unlike the cold gas , the warm material may be characterized by a single value of .",
    "however in this warm gas we find a value for the x - factor , @xmath4 1.5 @xmath5 10@xmath6  @xmath7 , significantly lower than the averages for the cold gas , the overall cmc and the milky way .",
    "overall we find an ( inverse ) correlation between and with @xmath8 @xmath11 .",
    "such a correlation may potentially explain the observed variations in global x - factors between gmcs as being due in large part to variations in the relative amounts of warm gas heated by ob stars within the clouds .",
