    "in this paper , we provide a systematic method to validate the domain of lyapunov functions around hyperbolic fixed points both for continuous and for discrete dynamical systems with computer assistance .",
    "first of all , we recall the definition of lyapunov functions for flows in the typical sense .",
    "let @xmath1 be a flow on @xmath2 .",
    "[ dfn - lyapunov - typical ] let @xmath3 be an open subset .",
    "consider the differential equation @xmath4 a _ lyapunov function _",
    "@xmath5 ( for the flow ) is a @xmath6-function satisfying the following conditions .    1 .",
    "@xmath7 holds for each solution orbit @xmath8 through @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   @xmath10 implies @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an equilibrium of ( [ autonomous - intro ] ) .",
    "lyapunov functions are heart of gradient dynamical systems , which ensure that all trajectories behave so that lyapunov functions decrease monotonously .",
    "such behavior is expected locally around hyperbolic fixed points or general invariant sets .",
    "once we construct lyapunov functions locally around invariant sets , they let us easy to understand local dynamics in terms of level sets of lyapunov functions . in definition",
    "[ dfn - lyapunov - typical ] , a lyapunov function @xmath13 is , if exists , defined in an open set @xmath3 , but it does not tell us how large @xmath14 can be chosen",
    ". furthermore , explicit constructions of lyapunov functions themselves are not easy because of nonlinearity of dynamical systems . for typical systems which possess lyapunov functions with explicit forms ,",
    "such systems themselves are fully determined by these functions , which are often called _ gradient systems _ ; namely , @xmath15 .",
    "although there is an abstract result concerning with the existence of lyapunov functions , which is known as _",
    "conley s fundamental theorem of dynamical systems _ ( e.g. @xcite ) , detections of the concrete form of @xmath13 and the concrete shape of @xmath14 near invariant sets remain open and depend on individual dynamical systems . despite the great importance for dynamical systems , construction of lyapunov functions in concrete systems",
    "remains open .",
    "there are several preceding works for validating functionals like lyapunov functions within explicit domains ( e.g. @xcite ) , many of which apply functionals called _ cones _ satisfying _ cone conditions _ ( e.g. @xcite ) to understanding asymptotic behavior around invariant sets .",
    "cones with cone conditions restrict the behavior of points in terms of differences between two points .",
    "in particular , these concepts describe stable and unstable manifolds of invariant sets as graphs of lipschitzian ( or smooth ) functions . on the other hand",
    ", there is a preceding study for constructing lyapunov functions in the sense of definition [ dfn - lyapunov - typical ] in explicitly given neighborhoods of hyperbolic equilibria @xcite .",
    "there lyapunov functions have very simple forms , and a sufficient condition for validating lyapunov functions in given domains as well as hyperbolicity of equilibria for ( semi)flows is proposed .    in these two directions ,",
    "there are several similarities .",
    "firstly , functionals ( cones , lyapunov functions ) describing asymptotic behavior have _ quadratic forms _ around equilibria or fixed points .",
    "secondly , validations of functionals are done via negative definiteness of matrices associated with functionals .",
    "thirdly , computer assisted analysis via _ interval arithmetics _ are applied to validating given quadratic forms being cones or lyapunov functions in explicitly given domains .",
    "this paper aims a systematic procedure of lyapunov functions around fixed points both for continuous and discrete dynamical systems by simple forms in given domains with computer assistance .",
    "this procedure gives us a general implementation of lyapunov functions around fixed points , which can be applied to various dynamical systems , as shown in preceding works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we also discuss relationships between preceding works ; cones with cone conditions , lyapunov functions in @xcite , and present studies , as well as a new aspect concerning with re - parameterization of trajectories .",
    "we believe that presenting arguments lead to a comprehensive understanding of lyapunov function validations .",
    "our central target function @xmath13 is a quadratic function as preceding works .",
    "the determination of domains @xmath13 being a lyapunov function , called _ lyapunov domain _ , consists of following two stages .",
    "* * stage 1 : negative definiteness of the matrix associated with @xmath16*.    for a domain containing an equilibrium , we verify the negative definiteness of specific matrix associated with @xmath17 along solution orbits with computer assistance , which gives us a sufficient condition so that @xmath13 is a lyapunov function in the domain .    * * stage 2 : direct calculations of the negativity of @xmath16 along trajectories*.    for domains which do not contain equilibria , we calculate @xmath17 directly with computer assistance and verify if it is negative .",
    "if such criteria pass for given domains , the quadratic function @xmath13 is validated as a lyapunov function on the domain .",
    "combination of validations in these two stages with computer assistance gives us a useful tool to validate explicit lyapunov domains of given quadratic functions as large as possible , which will be the basis for constructing locally defined lyapunov functions in various dynamical systems .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ section - cont ]",
    ", we discuss the construction of lyapunov functions for flows ( continuous dynamical systems ) .",
    "we provide a systematic construction of lyapunov functions being quadratic .",
    "we also generalize lyapunov functions to _ @xmath18-lyapunov functions _ , which is a generalization of _ @xmath19-cones _ in @xcite . in section",
    "[ section - aspect ] , several geometric and algebraic aspects containing mathematical validity of numerically computed objects associated with lyapunov functions , as well as relevance to preceding works ( e.g. @xcite ) are discussed . in section [ section - discrete ] ,",
    "we discuss the construction of lyapunov functions for maps ( discrete dynamical systems ) .",
    "the basic strategy for construction is similar to flows . a discrete dynamical systems version of @xmath18-lyapunov functions is also derived . in section [ section - lyapunov - periodic ] , we briefly review the computation of poincar maps for flows and their differentials so that we apply arguments in section [ section - discrete ] to poincar maps , which yields the construction of lyapunov functions for periodic orbits . in section [ section - example - cont ] and [ section - example - discrete ] ,",
    "several validation examples are shown for demonstrating applicability of arguments in previous sections .",

    "we can easily construct lyapunov functions .",
    "indeed , any linear vector fields can be generically written as , under the change of coordinates , @xmath42 in this case , ones easily see that the functional @xmath43 is a lyapunov function for ( [ aut - linear ] ) . under this observation , it is natural to consider that there are _ locally defined _ lyapunov functions around , at least , hyperbolic equilibria .",
    "moreover , lyapunov functions can be quadratic around hyperbolic equilibria .",
    "our aim here is to provide a systematic procedure for constructing quadratic lyapunov functions defined not only in a small neighborhood of hyperbolic equilibria but also in their explicitly given neighborhoods .",
