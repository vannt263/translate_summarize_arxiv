    "luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) are very luminous stars with log @xmath3 5.0 to 6.3 and variable spectral types between about o9 and a ( humphreys & davidson , 1994 ) . in the hr diagram , they are located in close proximity to the observed luminosity upper limit for very massive stars , the humphreys - davidson ( hd ) limit .",
    "this upper limit suggests that stars above log @xmath4 do not evolve into red supergiants ( rsg ) but that they are prevented from doing so by very severe mass loss in the previous phases .    from an observational point of view",
    ", lbvs are characterised by extreme instability , violent eruptions - with visual brightness increases of 3 magnitudes or more - and high mass loss .",
    "the material ejected ( up to several solar masses ) is often observed in the form of spectacular associated nebulae ( nota et al .",
    "1995 ) . in between such dramatic outbursts",
    ", lbvs still lose mass at high rates  typically 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 m@xmath7/yr ( e.g. leitherer 1997 ) .",
    "the properties of lbvs are reviewed by humphreys & davidson ( 1994 ) and in the proceedings of a dedicated workshop by nota & lamers ( 1997 ) .",
    "the ejected nebulae around lbvs have been found to have typical diameters of 0.5 to 2 pc , an expansion velocity between 25 and 140 km s@xmath8 , and a dynamical age of 5@xmath9@xmath10 to 5@xmath9@xmath2 years .",
    "the exceptions are @xmath11 car and p cygni whose ejecta have higher velocities and much shorter dynamical ages ( for a comprehensive discussion of lbv nebular properties , see review by nota & clampin , 1997 ) .",
    "lbv s are believed to be the precursors of wolf - rayet stars .",
    "however , the evolutionary phase of lbvs is still poorly understood : their instability and related nebula ejection is believed to occur during the post main sequence life of a massive star , but it is not clear exactly when and how .",
    "when the star is still on the main sequence , the o star wind creates a wind - blown bubble with a radius of at least 50 pc .",
    "this bubble contains the hot , shocked wind from the main sequence phase .",
    "the lbv nebula is then formed within this cavity by rapid mass loss during the lbv instability phase .",
    "subsequently , in the wolf - rayet phase , the fast and dense wind collides with the lbv nebula .",
    "waters et al ( 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) and voors et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have studied the properties of the dust in lbv nebulae and argued on the basis of the dust properties ( composition , grain size ) that the dust is very similar to that of rsgs .",
    "they conclude that the dust in lbv nebulae was ejected under very similar conditions , most likely when the star was a rsg .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derived the n and o abundances of several lbv nebulae , and noticed that the n / o abundance ratios are higher than for initial composition gas , but smaller than for gas with cno - equilibrium abundances .",
    "in fact , they show that the abundances are quite similar to those predicted for rsgs in the evolutionary models of the geneva group ( meynet et al .",
    "smith et al .",
    "discuss the problem of reconciling their nebular n / o ratios with the observed absence of rsg at high luminosities by postulating a pseudo - rsg phase .",
    "they suggest that if the star does not lose enough mass in the blue phase , than it could encounter its eddington limit , develop a convective envelope in response and become very bloated such that the star will appear as a rsg for a brief period .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", two different approaches have been recently presented to explain the occurrence of the lbv instability : + 1 ) langer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have proposed a mechanism based on enhanced mass loss , dominant towards the end of the core hydrogen burning evolution .",
    "this high mass loss maintains the star on the blue side of the hr diagram .",
    "the ignition of the h - burning shell forces the stellar radius to increase , and the corresponding redward evolution of the star in the hr diagram results in a destabilization of the envelope due to the proximity to the eddington limit ( lamers & fitzpatrick , 1988 ; lamers & noordhoek 1993 ) .",
    "the star experiences extreme mass loss ( as high as 5 @xmath9 10@xmath12 m@xmath13/yr ) which involves the enriched stellar surface layers .",
    "this phase corresponds to the observed lbv instability , and the mass ejection occurs therefore when the star is a blue supergiant . due to the large mass - loss rates in the lbv phase , the evolution of the star into a rsg is avoided .",
    "+ 2 ) alternatively , models of stothers & chin ( 1993 , 1996 ) predict that the major mass - loss occurs in a single ejection event during a brief rsg phase .",
    "they find that the star rapidly moves redward in the hr diagram after core hydrogen exhaustion .",
    "an instability is then triggered by the recombination of hydrogen and helium as a result of the envelope expansion , leading to the rapid loss of the h - rich envelope .",
    "the star then moves back to the blue and becomes a true lbv .",
    "the mass ejection occurs while the star is in a brief rsg phase , before the lbv phase .",
    "the problem with the first scenario is that the nature of the instability is not completely understood .",
    "the challenge to the second scenario is that the hd limit shows that no rsg exist with @xmath14  ( humphreys and davidson 1979 ) .",
    "this implies that two of the _ standard _ lbvs , ag car in the galaxy and r127 in the lmc , can not have been rsgs ( except maybe for a short time of @xmath15 years ) .    in reality , we still do not know the evolutionary phase at which the lbv nebulae are ejected .",
    "one way to address this problem is to study the lbv surface chemical composition .",
    "however , atmospheric analyses of heavy element abundances can be very uncertain .",
    "alternatively , we can study the abundance determinations of the circumstellar ejected nebulae , and compare the results with the predicted surface composition for massive stars during various phases of their evolution , including the effects of mass loss , convective mixing in the core and in the envelope and rotation induced mixing .",
    "some predictions have already been made on what one should expect : hydrodynamical models of the evolution of the circumstellar environment of a 60 m@xmath13 star have been made by garca - segura et al .",
    "( 1996a ) as the star transitions from an o star to an lbv and then to a wr star .",
    "they predict that the lbv nebula will have cno equilibrium abundances . however , lbv nebular abundance studies of smith et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) have shown that the observed n / o ratios are closer to cn - equilibrium values .",
    "this suggests that the nebulae were created by the ejection of surface layers that consist of a mixture of cn - processed gas and original gas .",
    "+ in this paper we study which effects can produce the abundances that are observed in the lbv nebulae .",
    "we consider mixing by convection of the outer layers in the red supergiant phase , and by rotation induced mixing during the main sequence phase .",
    "+ ( a ) in the case of convective mixing , the resulting surface abundance in the red supergiant phase depends critically on the total amount of mass that was lost during the main sequence phase .",
    "if the lbv nebulae are ejected during the rsg phase , we can determine the amount of mass that was lost prior to the envelope ejection .",
    "+ ( b ) in the case of rotation induced mixing , the surface abundance at the end of the main sequence phase depends critically on the ratio between the mixing time and the main sequence lifetime .",
    "if the lbv nebulae are ejected in the blue supergiant phase after the main sequence , we can determine the mixing timescale during the main sequence phase .",
    "+ we will compare the observed abundances of the lbv nebulae with both sets of predictions . combining this with information about the dynamical age , the mass , the ejection velocity and the morphology of the nebulae",

    "most lbvs and related transition objects ( eg . ofpe / wn9 stars ) display associated circumstellar nebulae , which are spatially resolved both in ground - based observations using coronography and by direct imaging with hst .",
    "these nebulae are very similar in terms of morphological and physical properties .",
    "they are typically 1 parsec in size , with morphologies which are mildly to extremely bipolar , with the possible exception of the nebula around p cygni ( barlow et al .",
    "1994 ; nota et al .",
    "they expand in the surrounding medium with velocities of the order of 25  140 km s@xmath8 .",
    "their size and expansion velocities identify dynamical timescales which are of the order of @xmath2 years .",

    "densities derived from the [ sii ] @xmath17 6717 , 6731 line ratio are generally found to be low ( 500 - 1000 cm@xmath12 ) and the temperatures , derived from the ratio of the [ nii ] lines , are in the range 5000 - 10000k .    the abundances and dynamical stuctures of the lbv nebulae can be used to study at what phase of the evolution of the central star these nebulae were ejected .",
    "we have selected four stars for which the nebula has been studied in detail .",
    "these include ag car and p cygni in the galaxy , and r  127 and s  119 in the lmc .",
    "we have omitted the well known lbv @xmath11 car , that was studied by dufour et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and ebbets et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , because of its peculiar nature .",
    "the nebula around r 143 is also omitted , because smith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that the nebula is not associated with the star .",
    "the properties of the four selected lbvs and their nebulae are summarized in table [ tbl : parameters ] .",
    "we list the distance and the luminosity , but not the radius or effective temperature because these values are variable for lbvs .",
    "we give the photospheric helium abundance .",
    "the parameters are from compilations by humphreys & davidson ( 1994 ) , crowther ( 1997 ) , nota & clampin ( 1997 ) and from crowther & smith ( 1997 ) .",
    "the table also shows the parameters of the nebulae , such as velocity , dynamical age , mean density and temperature , as well as the nebular abundances .",

    "( 1997 ; 1998 ) and schulte - ladbeck et al .",

    "for ag carinae , smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) derived a nitrogen enhancement of a factor 4.5@xmath191.3 and an oxygen deficiency of a factor 15.1@xmath197.2 .",
    "such mild enrichment is typical of material which has not reached cno equilibrium . for the other two nebulae around r127 and s119 , the abundance analysis ( smith et al . 1998 ) provided very similar results : for r127",
    ", a n enrichment was found of a factor 10.7@xmath202.2 , and o depletion of 2.0@xmath191.0 , with n / o = 0.89@xmath190.40 ; for s119 , smith et al .",
    "( 1998 ) were not able to secure an accurate electron temperature , and found a ratio n / o = 1.41 to 2.45 , similar to the value determined for r127 ( table  1 ) .",
    "n(n)/n(o ) . ] for the p cygni nebula , no accurate abundance analysis is currently available , except for the earlier work by johnson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , where n / s ratios are provided at one position in the nebula . in table  1",
    "we also give the number ratios n / h , n / o and n / s , which will be compared with evolutionary calculations .",
    "for the n / s ratios we only have upper limits because they are derived from the n@xmath21/s@xmath21 ratios with an unknown ratio s@xmath22/s@xmath23 .",
    "unfortunately we do not have reliable nebular s / h ratios which might have been used to derive the underabundance of h.      the accuracy of the derived abundances can be checked by comparing the sum of the c , n and o abundances to the initial abundance . since the changes in the abundances of these elements are due to the mixing with products from the cn and the no - cycles , the mass ratio of ( c+n+o)/(h+he ) at the stellar surface should remain constant during the evolution of the star , until the products of he - burning appear at the surface .",
    "if the nebulae had the initial ratio he / h=0.075 , we would expect a number ratio ( c+n+o)/h @xmath24 for the galactic nebulae and @xmath25 for the lmc nebulae .",
    "if the he / h ratio in the nebula is about 0.2 , as predicted on the basis of the observed n / o ratios ( see later : tables 2 and 3 ) then we expect ( c+n+o)/h @xmath26 for galactic nebulae and @xmath27 for the lmc nebulae . if the he / h ratio in the nebula is 0.40 , as it is in the stellar photospheres , then the mass fraction of h has decreased by about a factor two and so we would expect ratios of ( c+n+o)/h @xmath28 for the galactic nebulae and @xmath29 for the lmc nebulae .",
    "we note that the contribution of c is only about 30 percent for gas with the initial composition , and much less for gas with cn - equilibrium composition .",
    "so for nebulae enriched in n we can replace the above mentioned c+n+o abundance with the n+o abundance to reasonable accuracy .",
    "the data in table 1 show that the observed number ratio ( n+o)/h is about a factor two smaller than predicted for r127 and s119 . for p cygni",
    "the predicted value is within the wide range of the observed value . for ag car",
    "the observed ( n+o)/h ratio is about a factor five smaller than predicted .",
    "these discrepances are most likely due to errors in the determinations of the n / h and o / h ratio due to the inhomogeneity of the nebulae . in a non - homogeneous nebula that contains regions of different temperatures , either in the form of clumping or in the form of a temperature gradient , the strength of h@xmath30 is less affected than the strength of the forbidden lines , because the latter are collisionaly excited from their respective ion ground state , whereas the former is the product of h recombination .",
    "this results in a systematic overestimate of the electron temperature and , therefore , in a systematic underestimate in the derived ratios of metals relative to h ( e.g. , peimbert 1967 , panagia & preite martinez 1975 ) . in principle this can be tested by determining the s / h ratio , because s is not affected by the abundance changes inside the star .",
    "so the s / h ratio is a good measure of the changes in the h - content or of the errors in the abundance determinations due to inhomogeneities in the nebula .",
    "unfortunately we only have an upper limit for the n / s ratio of the ag car nebula , which does not provide a useful test .",
    "we have calculated the strength of the observed forbidden lines for simple spherical nebular models with clumping , or with gradients in temperature or density , for a given input abundance .",
    "we then used the calculated line ratios to derive the mean electron density , the mean electron temperature and the resulting abundances , in the same way as done in the analysis of the observed spectra .",
    "the resulting abundance ratios were then compared to the input abundance ratios .",
    "we found for a large range of models and clumping factors , that the thus derived abundance ratios n / h , o / h and s / h can differ drastically from the input values , for the reason mentioned above , but that the abundance ratios of the metals , n / o and n / s , are very insensitive to clumping and temperature or density gradients ( within about 0.1 dex for a wide range of clumping factors and gradients ) .",
    "for this reason we will concentrate on these ratios in the rest of this paper .",
    "the atomic abundances of the gaseous component of the lbv nebulae might be different from the abundances of the nebula at the time of the ejection due to several effects , which will be discussed and estimated below : + ( a ) a fraction of c and o may have been locked into co and several atomic species may be depleted due to dust , in particular o and si + ( b ) the nebula may have mixed with the gas of the interstellar ( is ) bubble into which it was ejected + ( c ) the nebula may have mixed with the wind from the star after it was ejected .",
    "+      infrared studies of lbv nebulae have shown that they contain significants amounts of co and dust ( e.g. mcgregor et al .",
    "1988 ; hutsmekers 1997 ) . the analysis of iso observations by waters et al .",
    "( 1997,1998 , 1999 ) and voors et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that most lbv nebulae contain o - rich dust , with a small contribution of c - rich pahs .",
    "this dust is mainly in the form of amorphous silicates , such as mgfesio@xmath31 and fe@xmath32sio@xmath31 , plus a minor contribution from crystalline silicates such as olivines and pyroxenes ( voors et al . 2000 ) .",
    "estimates of the dust mass vary between about @xmath33  and @xmath34  ( hutsemkers 1997 ; lamers et al .",
    "1996 ; voors et al . 2000 )",
    ". however , the presence of dust or molecules does not affect the abundance ratios derived from the _ gaseous _ component .",
    "this is because the nebular gaseous abundances are determined from the ionized regions of the nebulae , where no corrections for the presence of dust , molecules and neutral atoms are needed .",
    "the ejected nebula runs into the interstellar bubble that was blown during the main sequence phase .",
    "such an interaction may have changed the composition of the nebula from the outside . however , the density in the bubble is so low , on the order of @xmath33 atoms cm@xmath12 , that only about @xmath35  has been swept up .",
    "this is negligible compared to the mass of the nebula ( smith et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the stellar wind that is blowing since the nebula was ejected may have caught up with the nebula and may have changed the composition of the nebula from the inside .",
    "the amount of wind material that has run into the nebula is @xmath36 where  and @xmath37 are the mass loss rate and the velocity of the wind since the ejection of the nebula ; @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the expansion velocity and the dynamical age of the nebula and @xmath40 is the inner radius of the nebula . the mean mass loss rate  is not very well known for lbvs because the mass loss rate varies strongly between phases of high and low mass loss rates .",
    "studies of mass loss in various lbv phases indicate that the mean mass loss rate of ag car is @xmath41 and that the mean wind velocity is @xmath42 ( leitherer 1997 ) . with a nebular expansion velocity of 70 and a dynamical age of @xmath43 years ( table [ tbl : parameters ] ) we find that @xmath44 . a similar estimate for r127 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47  and",
    "@xmath48 years gives @xmath49 .",
    "these values are upper limits if the stars have not been lbvs immediately since the ejection of the nebula . for instance",
    ", if the nebula was ejected during the rsg phase and the star evolved to an lbv since then , the average wind velocity ( and possibly also the average mass loss rate ) will have been lower .",
    "garca - segura et al . ( 1996b ) have calculated the evolution of a nebula that was ejected during the rsg phase by a star with @xmath50 and interacted with the wind produced in the subsequent wolf - rayet ( wr ) phase . in their model",
    "the evolution from rsg to wr star is very short and lasts only about 100 years .",
    "this evolution does not allow the presence of an lbv phase about @xmath2 years after the nebula ejection , so it is not applicable to our program stars .",
    "we conclude that the initially ejected nebula may have mixed with wind material after the ejection .",
    "if this material had the same composition as the nebula , no enrichment has occurred . on the other hand ,",
    "if the wind material had a composition different from that of the ejected nebula , the presently observed chemical abundance of the nebula is a mixture of the two components .",
    "we will later present evidence ( sect .",
    "7 ) that an enrichment of the surface layers may indeed have occured after the nebula was ejected .",
    "this may have resulted in a slight enrichment of the nebula after its ejection .",
    "the abundance ratios of n / o and n / s , derived from observations of lbv nebulae and given in table [ tbl : parameters ] , can be used to derive the evolutionary stage of the star when the nebula was ejected .",
    "the n / o ratio in lbv nebulae is about 1 to 6 whereas we only have an upper limit for the n / s ratio of @xmath51 30 to 80 , except for the p cygni nebula ( table [ tbl : parameters ] ) .",
    "these ratios will be compared with predictions from evolutionary calculations for stars with convective and rotation induced mixing .",
    "although we have no he / h ratio determination for the nebulae , we will also study the changes in the he / h ratio in the stars during their evolution .",
    "this is of interest because the data in table [ tbl : parameters ] show that the _ photospheres _ of lbvs are remarkably helium - rich , and have a narrow number ratio of he / h @xmath52 to 0.7 or a helium mass fraction of @xmath53 to 0.73",
    ".    evolutionary models of massive stars and the resulting variations in the surface abundances have been calculated by several groups , e.g. maeder & meynet ( 1989 ) , langer ( 1991 ) , schaller  ( 1992 ) .",
    "we will use the evolutionary calculations by meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and schaerer et al .",
    "the evolution is strongly affected by mass loss and since different authors used different expressions for the mass loss rates , their evolutionary tracks can differ greatly . for instance , whether a massive star will go through a red supergiant phase or not depends on the amount of mass lost during the main sequence and the blue supergiant phase .",
    "in the next sections we describe the expected abundance changes in the interiors of massive stars from a very basic point of view . the purpose of this description is to point out where the layers with the observed abundance ratio n / o @xmath54 to 6 are located in the star , and at what point in the evolution they may have been ejected to form the lbv nebulae .",
    "we also determine the location of the layers where he / h @xmath55 because they appear at the surface of the star _ after _ the nebula was ejected .",
    "we will concentrate our efforts on stars with initial masses in the range of 85 to 40 , i.e. roughly the range of the lbvs .",
    "however , since rotating 20  models potentially can evolve to luminosities of more than @xmath56 ( heger et al .",
    "1997 ) , we will also study the evolution of a star with an initial mass of 20 . for the prediction of the changing surface abundances we need to know the chemical evolution inside the star and the size of the convective core .",
    "for this we adopted the evolutionary calculations of the geneva group ( meynet et al .",
    "1994 , schaerer et al .",
    "these authors calculated evolutionary tracks for two different sets of mass loss rates on the main sequence : the `` normal '' rates ( de jager et al .",
    "1988 ) and the same rates enhanced by a factor 2 .",
    "meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) argued that the tracks with the higher mass loss rates agree better with the observations .",

    "it is well known that hii region abundances are lower than solar values .",

    "( 1983 ) give the following number ratios :    @xmath59    the nebular n / o ratio is a factor 0.52 smaller than assumed in the evolutionary models .",
    "this difference is even worse for the lmc ( z=0.008 ) since the hii region analyses of dufour ( 1984 ) and russell & dopita ( 1990 ) give number ratios of    @xmath60    so the n / o ratio of the hii regions in the lmc is a factor 0.31 smaller than adopted in the evolutionary calculations for the lmc stars with @xmath61 .",
    "although the question of the correct initial abundances is still controversial since b - stars sometimes give different results to the hii region analyses ( killian 1992 , rolleston et al .",

    "we re - normalised the initial stellar abundances of the evolutionary models of meynet et al .",

    "this admittedly rough estimate shows that a significant fraction of the gas in the lbv nebulae must have gone through cn or cno processing .",

    "the main effect of the mass loss on the internal evolution is through the luminosity : a star with a higher mass loss rate will more slowly increase its luminosity during the main sequence phase than a star with a low mass loss rate , so the main sequence phase of the star with the higher mass loss rate will last longer .",
    "a considerable fraction of the stellar mass may have been lost before the star reaches the onset of the convective mixing .",

    "this reduction of the convection produces in the geneva tracks red supergiant models which have too high effective temperatures : the convection in the models does not reach deep enough , so the convective mixing is reduced , the envelope is not extended enough and the radius is not large enough to make cool red supergiants ( maeder , private communications ) .",

    "we compare the results derived above for the two explanations with the constraints of the dynamical age of the nebula and the present photospheric he / h ratio ( see tables 1 , 2 and 3 ) .",

    "the dynamical ages of the lbv nebulae are between 1 and 7 times @xmath2 years , apart from the p cygni nebula which is much younger .",
    "2 .   the lbv nebulae contain between about 2 and 8 solar masses of mildly enriched ionized gas , except for p cygni which has a much smaller nebular mass .",
    "the amount of molecular or neutral material in lbv nebulae is not well known .",
    "a recent study of the co emission from the ag car nebula ( nota et al .",
    "2000b ) shows that the nebula contains about @xmath173  in the form of co. the fraction of co is estimated to be @xmath174 of the total molecular gas , which then amounts to 2.6 .",
    "this is about as much as the 4.2  of ionized gas in the ag car nebulae .",
    "so the total amount of mass in lbv nebulae might be as high as twice the mass of the ionized gas .",
    "the photosphere of the lbvs is more chemically enriched than the nebula .",
    "the n / o ratio in the nebulae suggest a he / h ratio of about 0.3 for the nebula of ag car and about 0.2 for the nebulae around p cygni , r127 and s119 ( sections [ sec:5d ] and [ sec:6e ] ) . however , the photospheric he / h ratios are between 0.4 and 0.7 . 4 .",
    "the outflow velocities of the lbv nebulae are 70  for ag car and 140  for p cyg .",
    "the outflow velocities of the lmc stars r127 and s119 are 25 and 29  respectively . 5 .   no red supergiants with luminosities above @xmath175  have been found in the galaxy or in the lmc ( humphreys & davidson 1979 ) .",
    "this implies that either more luminous stars do not pass through a rsg phase or that their rsg phase lasts only a very short time , i.e. less than about a few @xmath2 years .",
    "let us suppose that the nebula was ejected during the rsg phase . from the nebular abundance we found that ag car must have lost about 25 %  of its initial mass prior to the onset of the envelope convection .",
    "the convection then created a layer of about 15  of mildly enriched material above the non - convective core .",
    "if the observed @xmath176 7  of the nebula ( ionized plus molecular gas ) was ejected near the beginning of the rsg phase , i.e. before significant rsg mass loss has occurred , the star would still have an envelope of about 8 of mildly enhanced material after the ejection .",
    "this is at odds with the fact that about @xmath2 years after the nebula was ejected the he / h ratio at the surface of the star has already increased significantly to the observed value of he / h @xmath177 0.42 .",
    "it would require an unrealistically high mass loss rate of about @xmath33  after the ejection of the nebula .",
    "the problem is even more severe for the lmc stars which have lost a smaller fraction of their initial mass before the envelope convection starts .",
    "they will have a much more massive layer with mildly enriched material and a predicted he / h ratio of only about 0.20 . in order for these stars to reach a ratio he / h @xmath177 0.4 at the surface requires the ejection of even more mass than from the galactic lbvs within the short dynamical age of their nebula .",
    "if the nebula was ejected near the _ end _ of the rsg phase , when the star had already lost about 10  as a rsg , the increase in surface abundance to the presently observed he / h ratio of about 0.4 within the dynamical age of the nebula can be explained because soon afterwards the deeper more enriched layers may have been exposed . adopting a `` normal '' rsg mass loss rate of about @xmath178",
    ", the star may have lost its last solar mass of mildly enriched material in the dynamical time of the nebula .",
    "the question is then , where is the mass that must have been ejected in the rsg phase _ before _",
    "the nebula was ejected ?",
    "for example , ag car had about 15  of convectively mixed material in the early - rsg phase , about 7 of which are in the nebula ( @xmath176 4  ionized and @xmath176 3  molecular )",
    ". the other 8 must have been lost before the nebula ejection . with a typical rsg wind velocity of 10",
    "that material should have reached a distance of about a few tenth of a parsec , and it would have been overtaken by the nebula that was ejected with a velocity of about 70  for ag car .",
    "so in that case we would have expected the visible nebula to contain practically all the gas that was lost during the rsg phase , i.e. about 15 .",
    "this is not observed .",
    "moreover , in that case we can not explain the lack of luminous rsg , because they must have lived about @xmath66 years to eject the initial 10  layer of the mixed material ( unless the mass loss rate was very high during that phase ) .",
    "let us now suppose that the nebula was ejected in the bsg phase , and that rotation induced mixing has affected the abundances as predicted in our calculations .",
    "( these abundances are confirmed for stars in the mass range 15 of 25  by the detailed evolutionary models for rotating stars by heger ( 1998 , p 81 ) and heger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . ) in this case , the n / o and n / s ratios can all be satisfactorily explained , although this requires differences in the adopted mixing time scales in the stars by about a factor of two .",
    "the increase of the cno - enrichment from the mild enhancement in the nebula , which indicates he / h @xmath177 0.2 , to the present day photospheric he / h ratio of about 0.4 to 0.7 can also be explained in the framework of the rotating stellar models by two effects which will both be operating : + ( 1 ) rotation induced mixing will continue after the ejection of the nebula in the bsg phase and the he / h ratio will keep increasing with time .",
    "in fact , the mixing is likely to become faster when the star moves away from the main sequence , because it may approach its @xmath179 limit for near - critical rotation in the layers where the radiation pressure is high ( langer 1998 ; langer et al .",
    "1999 ) . for near - critical rotation",
    "the mixing - time approaches the kelvin - helmholtz time , which is about @xmath2 years for a star with an initial mass of 60 .",
    "this means that within about @xmath2 years after the ejection of the nebula the composition may have changed drastically .",
    "+ ( 2 ) rotation - induced - mixing is a diffusive process that will result in an abundance gradient in the envelope , with the most enriched matter closer to the core ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:6c ] )",
    ". the ejection of the outer layers will therefore automatically reveal photospheric layers which are more enriched than the ejected gas .    in this respect",
    "the star p cygni is an interesting test case .",
    "the nebula was ejected only 2000 years ago .",
    "we do not know the he / h ratio in the nebula , but the n / s ratio implies that the he / h ratio in the nebula must be about 0.2 , whereas the he / h in the photosphere is 0.4 .",
    "such a difference implies that there must have been an abundance gradient near the outer layers of the star .",
    "an abundance gradient is expected for rotation induced mixing by diffusion but not for mixing by convection in the rsg phase .",
    "our simplified method of predicting the rotation - induced - mixing does not allow us to calculate the abundance gradients .",
    "heger et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have calculated the evolution of rotating stars in the mass range of 10 to 25  with diffusive mixing .",
    "although these models have lower masses than p cygni , they indicate that abundance gradients of the required order may well be present in rotating massive blue supergiants .    additional evidence for a prominent role of rotation in the ejection of the nebula comes from the observed bipolar structure of several lbv nebulae ( nota , 1997 ) and the linear polarization of the uv and optical radiation of ag  car and r  127 ( schulte - ladbeck et al . 1994 ) .    a more indirect argument for the ejection of the lbv nebulae in the blue supergiant phase may come from the expansion velocities of the nebulae",
    "the expansion velocity of the galactic nebulae of ag car and p cygni are 70 and 140  respectively .",
    "the wind speeds of luminous red supergiants are smaller and on the order of 10 to 20  ( reimers 1975 , dupree & reimers , 1987 ) .",
    "although the ejection of the nebulae may have been due to a process other than the normal rsg wind , it is unlikely that this process could have lead to an ejection velocity much higher than that of the wind . in general ,",
    "an _ increase _ in the mass loss rate by some subphotospheric mechanism results in a _ decrease _ of the velocity ( unless a large amount of extra energy is generated as in nova outbursts ) . on the other hand , the wind velocities of luminous blue supergiants with high mass loss rates such as @xmath180 sco or @xmath16 cyg are about 100 to 200 .",
    "an increase in the mass loss rate by a significant factor , such as during the ejection of the nebula , will result in a decrease of the wind velocity .",
    "so it is easier to explain the velocities of the nebulae of p cyg and ag car if they are ejected in the bsg phase than in the rsg phase .",
    "( the velocities of the nebulae of the lmc stars r127 ( 29 ) and s119 ( 25 ) are markedly smaller than those of the galactic counter parts .",
    "in fact they are close to those expected for red supergiants . until we understand the ejection mechanism of the lbv nebulae and its dependence on metallicity , it is difficult to explain the reason for the difference in nebular velocity between the galactic lbvs and their counterparts in the lmc . )",
    "in an attempt to explain the origin of the lbv nebulae , which are mildly enriched in n and depleted in o , we have studied the effects that can modify their composition . the results are summarized .",
    "* we have calculated the expected abundance changes at the stellar surface due to two effects : ( a ) envelope convection in the rsg phase ( sect .",

    "* we have shown that the abundance patterns of four lbv nebulae , in particular the n / o and n / s ratios , can be explained by both mechanisms : +  either , by mixing due to an outer convective envelope . in that case",
    "the lbv nebula must have been ejected during the red supergiant phase .",
    "the observed n / o and n / s ratios then provide an estimate of the amount of mass that must have been lost before the envelope convection sets in . for this scenario",

    "the mixing times are between @xmath168 and @xmath181 years .",
    "these values are reasonable , considering the fast rotation of the main sequence o - stars .",
    "additional evidence that rotational mixing is common in early type stars comes from the fact that a considerable fraction of the oba supergiants and even some o main sequence stars have an enhanced n abundance ( e.g. walborn , 1988 ; k.c .",
    "smith et al .",
    "1998 ; venn 1996 , 1997 , 1999 ) * both models ( convective or rotation induced mixing ) predict a nebular he / h ratio that is about a factor two smaller than the observed _ photospheric _ abundance of he / h @xmath177 0.4 to 0.7 .",
    "this enrichment of the stellar surface must have occurred after the nebula was ejected , i.e. within the dynamical timescale of the nebulae of about @xmath2 years .",
    "this can not be explained in the context of the nebular ejection during the rsg phase , but it is a logical consequence of rotation induced mixing for two reasons : + ( 1 ) the mixing is expected to become faster as the star expands after the main sequence phase and approaches its @xmath179 limit for critical rotation in the layers where the radiation pressure is high . depending on their eddington - factors , for stars near critical rotation the mixing time may become as short as the kelvin - helmholtz time , which is of order @xmath2 years for a star of 60 .",
    "+ ( 2 ) contrary to convective envelope mixing , rotation - induced - mixing is a diffusive process that results in an abundance gradient in the envelope with the more enriched material closer to the core .",
    "the ejection of surface layers will automatically reveal the more enriched deeper layers .",
    "* the expansion velocities of about 100  of the lbv nebulae of ag  car , p cyg and r  143 can be explained if the nebulae were ejected during the bsg phase but not during the rsg phase .",
    "the low expansion velocities of r  127 and s  119 might be the result of deceleration by interaction ( these are the oldest nebulae of our sample ) or due to the small radiative acceleration because of the low metallicity of the lmc stars .",
    "we conclude that the abundance pattern observed in lbv nebulae and in the photospheres of their central stars may be explained with the rotation induced mixing scenario .",
    "this scenario may explain all observations consistently . in the rotation scenario the differences in the n / o ratios of the lbv nebulae are due to different mixing time scales , that are most likely due to differences in the initial rotation rates .",
    "an advantage of the mixing scenario may be that it ties in with the lbv outburst model involving the @xmath179-limit ( langer et al .",
    "1999 ) , which appears to be able to explain the bi - polar morphology found in virtually all lbv nebulae ( nota et al .",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate if the model for the outburst due to the @xmath179-limit might also explain the fact that the photospheric he / h ratio of the lbvs is in a narrow range of 0.4 to 0.7",
    ". this narrow range might possibly be due to the fact that in such a model , the rotation determines both the moment of the outburst and the amount of mixing .",
    "how do we combine the scenario that the lbv nebulae are ejected in the bsg phase with the results of the studies of the iso spectra of these nebulae by waters et al .",
    "( 1997 ; 1998 ; 1999 ) and voors et al .",
    "these authors have shown that the dust in the lbv nebulae is very similar to the dust around red supergiants , i.e. mainly in the form of amorphous silicates plus a minor contribution from crystalline silicates such as olivines and pyroxenes . since the composition depends sensitively on the conditions during the ejection of the material , waters et al .",
    "( 1997 ; 1998 ; 1999 ) have argued that the lbv dust must have been ejected when the star was a rsg .",
    "however , one has to be careful with applying this argument and one should make a distinction between two possible interpretations : + ( a ) the star was a red supergiant in the evolutionary sense , i.e. it had a large convective envelope during a typical evolutionary timescale of order @xmath2 to @xmath66 years .",
    "( we have rejected this possibility on the basis of the abundances and velocities of the lbv nebulae ) + ( b ) during the ejection of the nebula , by whatever mechanism , the star was temporarily cool and large in size , resembling a rsg .",
    "this is likely because a very high temporary mass loss rate will produce an extended cool pseudo - photosphere because of its large optical depth .",
    "the dust that forms outside such a photosphere will be formed under similar conditions as in rsg winds .",
    "this explanation agrees with the arguments that the nebula was ejected in a _ temporary _ rsg phase .",
    "we conclude that many arguments point to the lbv nebulae being ejected during the blue supergiant phase and that the chemical enrichment is due to rotation induced mixing .",
    "this suggests the following _ evolutionary scenario _ for the formation of the lbv nebulae with the observed chemical and dynamical properties : + 1 .",
    "mildly or rapidly rotating massive stars experience rotation induced mixing during the ms phase .",
    "this enhances the he / h ratio from the initial value of 0.1 to about 0.2 to 0.4 and the n / o ratio from 0.07 to about 1 to 5 in the envelope , depending on the ratio between the mixing time and main sequence life time .",
    "this explains the existence of the on - stars .",
    "after leaving the main sequence and evolving into blue supergiants , the stars run into the @xmath179-limit , which is the critical rotation limit in a star with a significant contribution by radiation pressure .",
    "+ 3 . when the star reaches the @xmath179-limit it ejects a large amount of mass , on the order of one or a few solar masses .",
    "the ejected matter has an enhanced n / o ratio , because it consists of matter from the envelope that was mixed during the main sequence phase .",
    "this explains the observed abundances of lbv nebulae .",
    "when the star has reached thermal equilibrium after the ejection , it is again located to the left of the @xmath179-limit in the hr - diagram .",
    "it will then start again to expand and will reach the @xmath179-limit . in this way the star may suffer multiple ejections , with time intervals on the order of a fraction of the kelvin - helmholtz timescale , i.e. about @xmath10 to @xmath2 years .",
    "this may explain the relatively large number of eruptions in galactic lbvs ( two in about 6 lbvs ) that have been observed during the last four hundred years .",
    "if the ejections of a large amount of mass are due to the star reaching its @xmath179-limit , we can expect that the mass is ejected mainly in the equatorial plane .",
    "( models of moderately rotating stars show that the mass flux from the poles is slightly larger than from the equator , e.g. maeder ( 1999 )",
    ". this will not be the case for a star near critical rotation . in any case",
    ", the density of the equatorial wind will always be higher than the density of the polar wind , because the wind velocity is very sensitive to the local escape velocity and will therefore be lower in the equatorial region than in the polar region , e.g. pelupessy et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . )",
    "the nebula ejected at the first ejection ( when the star has moved off the main sequence ) will be influenced very little by the wind form the main sequence phase , because the main sequence wind velocity is expected to be higher than the velocity of the ejecta . however",
    ", the nebula formed by the later ejecta may be shaped by the presence of the equatorial circumstellar matter from the previous ejection or from the equatorially enhanced winds from the rapidly rotating star in between the ejections .",
    "this may explain the observed bipolar structure of most lbv nebulae .",
    "+ 6 . during the ejection phase ,",
    "the outflow is optically thick , which results in a large effective radius and a low effective temperature of the star that temporarily resembles a red supergiant .",
    "this explains the similarity between the properties of dust in lbv nebulae and in rsg winds .",
    "+ 7 . after each ejection , the he / h ratio and the n / o ratio of the stellar photosphere is ( slightly ) higher than that of the ejected gas , because there is an abundance gradient in the envelope due to the continued rotation induced mixing of the envelope with the deeper layers .",
    "the mixing gets faster and the abundance gradient gets steeper , the closer the star moves to the @xmath179-limit .",
    "this may explain why the photospheric he / h ratio is higher in the lbv photospheres than in their nebulae .",

    "<S> we use the analysis of the heavy element abundances ( c , n , o , s ) in circumstellar nebulae around luminous blue variables to infer the evolutionary phase in which the material has been ejected . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate on four aspects . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 1 ) we discuss the different effects that may have changed the gas composition of the nebula since it was ejected : mixing with the swept up gas from the wind - blown bubble , mixing with the gas from the faster wind of the central star , and depletion by co and dust . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 2 ) we calculate the expected abundance changes at the stellar surface due to envelope convection in the red supergiant phase . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this depends strongly on the total amount of mass that was lost prior to the onset of the envelope convection . _ </S>",
    "<S> if _ the observed lbv nebulae are ejected during the red supergiant phase , the abundances of the lbv nebulae require a significantly smaller amount of mass to be lost than assumed in the evolutionary calculations of meynet et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1994 ) . </S>",
    "<S> + ( 3 ) we calculate the changes in the surface composition during the main sequence phase by rotation induced mixing . _ </S>",
    "<S> if _ the nebulae are ejected at the end of the main sequence phase , the abundances in lbv nebulae are compatible with mixing times between @xmath0 and @xmath1 years . </S>",
    "<S> these values are reasonable , considering the high rotational velocities of main sequence o - stars . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of on stars supports this scenario . + ( 4 ) the predicted he / h ratio in the nebulae , derived from the observed n / o ratios , are significantly smaller than the current observed photospheric values of their central stars . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that either ( a ) the nebula was ejected from a star that had an _ abundance gradient _ in its envelope , or ( b ) that fast mixing on a time scale of @xmath2 years must have occurred in the stars _ immediately after _ the nebula was ejected . </S>",
    "<S> + combining various arguments we show that the lbv nebulae are ejected during the blue supergiants phase and that the stars have _ not _ gone through a red supergiant phase . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical enhancements are due to rotation induced mixing , and the ejection is possibly triggered by near - critical rotation . during the ejection , the outflow was optically thick , which resulted in a large effective radius and a low effective temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the observed properties of the dust around lbvs closely resemble the properties of dust formed around red supergiants . </S>"
