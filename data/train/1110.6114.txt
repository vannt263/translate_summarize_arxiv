    "the eprl / fk spin foam models @xcite represent a class of spin foam models whose boundary states are the loop quantum gravity spin networks , while the vertex amplitudes are constructed such that all the discretized constraints of the plebanski action are imposed . the partition function for an eprl / fk spin foam model can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 are @xmath2 spins assigned to the faces @xmath3 of the dual @xmath4-complex @xmath5 for a spacetime triangulation , @xmath6 are the livine - speziale normal vectors , one for each edge @xmath7 and the adjacent face @xmath3 of @xmath5 , see @xcite .",
    "the face amplitude @xmath8 can be chosen to be @xmath9 , see @xcite , while @xmath10 is the vertex amplitude , which can be represented as a certain linear combination of the lorentz group @xmath11-symbols , see @xcite for details .    the classical limit of the quantum gravity theory defined by the path integral ( [ scos ] )",
    "can be determined by computing the corresponding effective action .",
    "the effective action can be expanded as the classical action plus the quantum corrections , which are proportional to the powers of @xmath12 , so that in the limit @xmath13 one will obtain the classical action .",
    "one way to do this is to calculate the graviton correlation functions in the large - spin limit , see @xcite .",
    "however , this approach has a drawback , since it requires the knowledge of infinitely many correlation functions in order to construct the corresponding effective action . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective action can be computed directly @xcite , which is much easier to do .",
    "we will sketch this computation here .    in order to calculate the effective action",
    ", the partition function has to be finite . the convergence of ( [ scos ] )",
    "can be studied by introducing a real deformation parameter @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 stays the same , see @xcite .",
    "one also needs to know the large - spin asymptotics of @xmath10 , which is given by @xmath18 \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 is a homogeneous function of order 12 , @xmath20 are homogeneous functions of order zero , @xmath21 or @xmath22 , depending on whether the vertex boundary constitutes a lorentzian or euclidean regge geometry , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is the barbero - immirzi parameter and @xmath24 is the regge action for the vertex @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 at a vertex do not form a regge geometry , then @xmath27 falls off faster that any power of @xmath28 , see @xcite .",
    "one also needs the asymptotics for the case when some of the @xmath29 are big and other are small , but it is not difficult to see that in any case @xmath30 is a bounded function .",
    "then it can be shown that @xmath31 is absolutely convergent for @xmath32 , see @xcite .",
    "another complication which has to be resolved before calculating the effective action is that the asymptotics ( [ verta ] ) is of the @xmath33 type , instead of the @xmath34 type .",
    "this can be resolved by redefining the vertex in the following way @xmath35 then @xmath36 when all @xmath29 are large .    if @xmath37 one can obtain the exponential asymptotics of the vertex amplitude by making a linear combination of @xmath38 and its complex conjugate @xcite .",
    "another way is to use the fact that @xmath38 is a linear combination of @xmath11-symbols , and to change the coefficients such that the exponential asymptotics is achieved , see @xcite .",
    "an effective action @xmath39 can be defined for a spin foam model by adapting the the background field method from quantum field theory ( qft ) , see @xcite . in the case of the eprl / fk models one obtains @xmath40 where @xmath26 are the background variables and @xmath41 .",
    "this formula is valid in the semiclassical limit , i.e. when @xmath42 and the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath23 is fixed .",
    "one can then employ the asymptotic formula ( [ asredv ] ) for the vertex amplitude in the definition of the effective action ( [ bfmea ] ) , since the background spins @xmath29 are all large .",
    "it is known that the background configurations @xmath26 which form a regge geometry have a dominant contribution to the path integral ( [ scos ] ) for large spins , see @xcite . in that case @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a set of lengths for the edges of the spacetime triangulation , and one can show by using ( [ asredv ] ) and the standard gaussian integral formulas , see @xcite , that @xmath45 @xmath46 denotes the regge action for the spacetime triangulation and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the number of vertices of a face @xmath3 .",
    "the matrix @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the matrices formed from the corresponding second - order partial derivatives of @xmath54 evaluated at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath57 are given by @xmath58    the notation @xmath59 in ( [ foea ] ) means that @xmath60 so that the first term in ( [ foea ] ) is of @xmath61 , the second and the third term in ( [ foea ] ) are of @xmath62 , the next term is of @xmath59 and so on .",
    "hence the leading term for @xmath42 is the regge action , which means that it is the classical limit of the theory .",
    "if the triangulation of the spacetime is fine enough , the regge action can be approximated by the einstein - hilbert action as @xmath63 , and one recovers general relativity in the limit of smooth geometry @xcite .",
    "the second term in ( [ foea ] ) comes from the face amplitude and the regularization factor in the vertex amplitude , while the third term is a discretization of the trace - log term from qft .",
    "the method used in @xcite to calculate the effective action was based on the `` on - shell '' background , i.e. the background @xmath26 was chosen such that @xmath26 formed an `` on - shell '' regge geometry . in this case @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a set of edge lengths which satisfy the regge action equations of motion .",
    "after the calculation was done , the @xmath66 background was replaced with a background @xmath44 , where the lengths in the set @xmath44 do not have to satisfy the regge equations .",
    "in qft it is known that such an approach is accurate only up to the first - order in @xmath12 , since the exact formula for the effective action is given by @xmath67 see @xcite .",
    "the formula ( [ qfteea ] ) is an integro - differential equation , which can be solved perturbatively as @xmath68 and one does not need to use an on - shell background @xmath69 in the calculation .    the exact qft formula ( [ qfteea ] ) can be applied to an eprl / fk spin foam model as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the spin - foam analog of the higher - loop correction term from ( [ qfteea ] ) .",
    "the background @xmath26 will be chosen to be a regge background @xmath72 , where the lengths @xmath44 are off - shell , i.e. do not have to satisfy the regge equations of motion .",
    "if the background is chosen such that it does not form a regge geometry , then we expect that @xmath73 will be exponentially suppressed , i.e. @xmath74    the analog of the @xmath12-expansion ( [ hbare ] ) is the formula ( [ eaexp ] ) , which we will write as @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath79 . by using the techniques from @xcite",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath80 is the same as the @xmath62 term from ( [ foea ] ) , while the differences between the formula ( [ bfmea ] ) and the formula ( [ esfea ] ) will appear for @xmath79 terms .",
    "the effective action approach from qft is quite useful for exploring the semiclassical limit of spin foam models of quantum gravity since the calculations in this approach are much easier than the calculations in the other approaches .",
    "the effective action approach can also tell us what kind of vertex amplitude we should choose in order to obtain a spin foam model whose classical limit is gr .",
    "the first - order quantum corrections have two terms , see ( [ foea ] ) .",
    "the third term in ( [ foea ] ) is a discrete analog of the usual trace - log term from qft , while the second term is specific for spin foam models",
    ". it will be important to find out what is the form of these quantum corrections in the smooth geometry limit , since these corrections will determine the first - order back - reaction effects for black holes and the cosmological evolution .",
    "the higher - order corrections can be calculated from the equation ( [ esfea ] ) .",
    "it would be interesting to apply the effective action approach to the regge model , and compare the results to the results obtained in the spin foam case .",
