    "the standard cosmological model , motivated by measurements of temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , the large scale distribution of galaxies @xcite , and by evidence of the accelerated expansion of the universe from supernova observations @xcite , requires that the universe possesses a flat spatial geometry with a corresponding critical density , approximately 27 percent of which consists of physical matter .",
    "however these observations also indicate that only 4 percent of this matter is baryonic in nature , implying that the remaining 23 percent consists of an elusive , non - baryonic component called dark matter ( dm ) owing to the severe constraints that current astronomical data sets on its radiative capabilities .    despite this compelling evidence for the existence of dm ,",
    "its precise nature is still a topic of debate .",
    "particle physicists have independently supported dm by postulating the existence of a variety of exotic particles with wide - ranging properties that may potentially solve problems in particle physics whilst resulting in a thermal relic particle density that is consistent with current observational constraints .",
    "the most intensely studied dm candidate is the lightest neutralino @xcite , a weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) motivated by supersymmetric extensions of the standard model of particle physics . in many of these extensions",
    "the neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . in theories where the lsp is stable , for example theories where r - parity is a conserved quantum number @xcite , the neutralino is thus a highly - motivated dm candidate",
    "furthermore , an attractive feature of neutralinos is that a large region of the relevant supersymmetric parameter space can be investigated using cern s large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    whilst neutralino",
    "dm is `` cold '' , owing to its negligible free - streaming length ( i.e. the length scale below which fluctuations in dm density are suppressed ) , warm dm ( wdm ) is typically lighter and possesses a much longer free - streaming length .",
    "wdm is a viable alternative to cold dark matter ( cdm ) models which may potentially resolve several shortfalls of the standard cdm model , such as for example the over - prediction of low mass satellites and the existence of cuspy halos @xcite . among wdm candidates ,",
    "there are sterile neutrinos @xcite , majorons @xcite and light dm ( ldm ) particles @xcite .",
    "what makes ldm interesting for this study is the fact that it can self - annihilate , as opposed to other forms of wdm , and therefore its annihilation rate can be enhanced by overdensities .    in this paper , we re - examine the influence of neutralino and ldm annihilations on the thermal history of the universe at times between the epochs of recombination and reionisation , commonly referred to as the `` dark ages '' , when gas existed in a nearly uniform , dark , neutral state .",
    "the investigation of the dark ages is one of the frontiers of modern cosmology , and will be carried on by a new generation of radio interferometers such as lofar , mwa , 21cma , and ska , as well as single antenna experiments such as edges and core .",
    "these experiments will look for the redshifted 21 cm signal associated with the hyperfine triplet - singlet transition of neutral hydrogen .",
    "if dm annihilates or decays , the resulting products subsequently collide and heat the surrounding gas , increasing its kinetic temperature and ionisation fraction .",
    "this is in turn manifested as distinct features in the 21 cm background signal that can be used to constrain the properties of dm @xcite .    with few exceptions ( e.g.  @xcite ) ,",
    "past studies proclaim that the heating effects associated with the annihilation of susy wimp dm are too small to be detected by current radio interferometers .",
    "however , these studies overlook the enhancements to the dm annihilation rate in galactic halos and in their substructures @xcite , which could be large enough to make the dm signature detectable by the next generation radio telescopes . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the effect of neutralino and ldm annihilations on the 21 cm signal when accounting for the effect of dm clustering .",
    "+ the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : basic_physics ] we elaborate on the basic properties of neutralinos and ldm .",
    "we also discuss the basic physics describing the way in which energy from annihilations is injected into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . in ",
    "[ sec : eg_dm_ann_rate ] and  [ sec : dm_ann_rate ] we calculate the enhancement in the dm annihilation rate caused by the presence of halos and their substructures . in ",
    "[ sec : absorbed_fraction ] we estimate how much of the energy produced in a single dm annihilation is actually injected into the igm . in  [ sec:21cm_background ] we discuss the modifications to the differential equations describing the evolution of the ionised fraction and kinetic temperature of the igm and subsequently use these equations to calculate the modified 21 cm background . in  [ sec : results ] we calculate the predicted 21 cm background for our benchmark neutralino and ldm models and discuss the potential for a detection . finally , in  [",
    "sec : discussion ] we summarise our results and draw our conclusions .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric ( susy ) neutralino is a superposition of higgsinos , winos and binos .",
    "consequently , neutralinos are electrically neutral and colourless , only interacting weakly and gravitationally , and hence very difficult to detect directly . in susy models that conserve r - parity ,",
    "the lsp is stable @xcite .",
    "consequently , in a scenario where present - day cdm exists as a result of thermal freeze - out , the dominant species of cdm could quite possibly include the lsp .",
    "the relic density of the lsp will then heavily depend on its mass and annihilation cross section . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the lsp is the lightest susy neutralino .",
    "the neutralino is a popular candidate for cdm because the theoretically - motivated values of these parameters yield a corresponding value of the relic density that is in good agreement with observations ( for a more detailed review of the various properties and motivations for neutralino dm see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "neutralinos possess a wide - range of annihilation spectra owing to the vast extent of currently unexcluded susy parameter space . owing to the majorana nature of the neutralino ,",
    "its annihilation to fermionic channels is suppressed by a factor proportional to the square of the mass of the final state .",
    "this means that , if the neutralino is lighter than the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bosons , annihilations will be dominated by the process @xmath7 with a minor contribution by @xmath8 .",
    "assuming annihilations are dominated by the former process , the resulting spectrum will depend entirely on the lsp mass . for heavier lsps ,",
    "the annihilation products become more complex , often determined by several dominant annihilation modes , including @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 as well as @xmath12 and @xmath8 .    the other dm candidate we consider is ldm , consisting of mev mass particles , which annihilate to electron - positron pairs and",
    "consequently were considered to be a possible source of the positrons contributing to the 511kev positronium decay signature from the bulge of the galaxy observed by spi / integral @xcite . while the current view favours the interpretation of the 511 kev feature as due to @xmath13 injection by a population of astrophysical sources , there is nevertheless continued interest in reviving a dark matter interpretation because of the possible connection with other anomalous spatially extended signals seen from the innermost galaxy , specifically the wmap and the fermi hazes @xcite .",
    "more exotic dark matter models are required in this case , most specificaly some form of multicomponent dark matter ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "relevant analyses of the 511 kev emission impose the constraint on the ldm mass @xmath14 in order not to overproduce detectable gamma - rays from inner bremsstrahlung processes @xcite ( although see @xcite ) .",
    "a stronger , albeit less conservative constraint , @xmath15 can be obtained if one considers the generation of gamma - rays from the in - flight annihilation between positrons produced from ldm annihilation and electrons residing in the interstellar medium of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "both in the case of neutralinos and ldm , the average rate of energy absorption per hydrogen atom in the igm at a redshift @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the dm particle , @xmath19 is the thermally - averaged dm annihilation cross section , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the current _ average _ number densities of dm and hydrogen respectively , and @xmath22 is the fraction of energy which is absorbed by the igm .",
    "the `` clumping factor '' @xmath23 is the redshift - dependent enhancement of the annihilation rate owing to the presence of dm structures , relative to a completely homogeneous universe ) assumes dirac dm particles ; for majorana particles this should be further multiplied by a factor of 2 . ] .",
    "in the standard cosmological model , all structure in the universe originated from small amplitude quantum fluctuations during an epoch of inflationary expansion shortly after the big bang . the linear growth of the resulting density fluctuations is then completely determined by their initial power spectrum , which for @xmath24cdm is usually assumed to be a power law with spectral index @xmath25 .",
    "current limits on @xmath25 from observations of temperature fluctuations in the cmb conducted by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe , @xmath26 ( at 68% confidence level ) @xcite , support the existence of a power spectrum consistent with inflation .    during the expansion of the universe",
    ", the aforementioned small initial density fluctuations will eventually grow and produce the structures that we observe today .",
    "in the currently accepted cosmological model , smaller structures form first and then merge to form larger ones in a process of `` bottom - up '' hierarchical structure formation . the mass distribution at any given redshift can potentially be determined through the use of numerical simulations .    as a first approximation ,",
    "the smaller progenitors forming larger isolated structures are completely disrupted after merging and the resulting `` smooth '' dm density distribution can be described by a continuous function , conventionally of the form @xmath27 ^{(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha } } , \\label{rho}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the distance from the centre of the halo , @xmath29 is a scale radius , @xmath30 is a normalisation factor , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are free parameters .",
    "however , n - body simulations of cdm halos reveal that a wealth of substructure halos ( henceforth referred to as subhalos ) exist within such halos .",
    "moreover , utilising results from the via lactea ii simulations , @xcite claimed that a further generation of sub - subhalos exist with a near self - similar mass distribution relative to their parent subhalo .",
    "this suggests the possibility that if one were to conduct simulations with sufficiently high resolution , one would find a long nested near self - similar series of halos within halos within halos etc .",
    ", all the way down to the smallest halos ) . ] .",
    "this has significant implications for the indirect detection of annihilating dm since the rate of dm annihilations is proportional to the square of the local density , and hence the presence of over - densities can significantly increase the annihilation rate relative to that obtained with a smooth dm distribution .",
    "the above scenario applies to structures formed in a cdm - dominated universe . in a wdm - dominated universe , the significant damping of small - scale density fluctuations , due to the larger free - streaming length ,",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "following @xcite , this can be accounted for by using the modified power spectrum @xmath33 , where the wdm transfer function is approximated by @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the free - streaming length .    for wdm particles with negligible interaction rates ,",
    "the free - streaming length is related to the particle mass @xmath18 by @xcite .",
    "@xmath36 however , as we will show below , the interaction rates for self - annihilating ldm in the models considered here are non - negligible . in this case , the free - streaming length is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the wdm self - annihilation rate at the decoupling redshift @xmath39 given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the thermally - averaged product of the wdm annihilation cross section and relative speed of two annihilating wdm particles , evaluated at the same time . in order to obtain the thermal relic density observed today ,",
    "one requires @xmath42@xmath43s@xmath44 .    for @xmath45mev",
    "we obtain @xmath46pc and @xmath47pc , while for @xmath48mev , we obtain @xmath49pc and @xmath50pc . hence , in both cases",
    "the co - moving free - streaming length set by wdm interactions is at least an order of magnitude larger than that when interactions are completely negligible , and consequently we must use the former in our determination of the cut - off scale in the wdm power spectrum .",
    "we follow the treatment by @xcite and define a characteristic free - streaming wavenumber @xmath51 such that @xmath52 , leading to @xmath53 .",
    "this wavenumber is then related to a characteristic filtering mass @xmath54 by @xmath55 where @xmath56 . in this paper",
    "we invoke the approximation @xmath57 , where here @xmath58 is the minimum mass of a ldm halo , and equal to approximately @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath45mev and @xmath61mev respectively .",
    "since the mass within a given co - moving volume is constant as the universe expands , the result @xmath62 is independent of redshift .",
    "below , we perform a series of detailed calculations illustrating the enhancement of the annihilation rate relative to that obtained with a completely smooth universe , known as the _ clumping factor_.",
    "we assume a standard homogeneous , isotropic universe with a flat spatial geometry .",
    "let @xmath63 be the average annihilation rate within a generic dm halo of mass @xmath64 located at redshift @xmath16 . even for large @xmath64",
    ", this source can be regarded as an unresolved point - source and we assume this throughout , for all halos considered .",
    "the rate of annihilations per unit volume at a given redshift is then equal to @xmath65 where we have introduced the unconditional halo mass function , d@xmath66d@xmath64 , i.e. the co - moving number density of virialised halos with mass @xmath64 located at redshift @xmath16 , ( the factor @xmath67 converts this from co - moving to proper density ) .",
    "the integral spans over the mass range @xmath68 , where @xmath58 can be as small as @xmath69 , due to kinetic decoupling in the case of cdm @xcite , and approximated by the filtering mass ( [ m_f ] ) in the case of wdm .",
    "three ingredients are required in order to calculate the annihilation rate ( [ rate_z ] ) .",
    "firstly , we need to specify the annihilation cross section of our dm candidates ( in our case neutralinos or ldm ) .",
    "secondly , we need to specify the dm density profile of a generic halo of mass @xmath64 at redshift @xmath16 .",
    "finally , we need an estimate of the distribution of halos , i.e. an estimate of the halo mass function @xmath70 .",
    "press - schechter theory @xcite postulates that the cosmological mass function of dm halos can be expressed in the universal form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the average co - moving dm density , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the present critical density of the universe .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 is defined as the ratio of the critical overdensity required for spherical collapse at redshift @xmath16 extrapolated using linear theory to present time , and @xmath76 is the r.m.s . of primordial density fluctuations",

    "@xmath76 is related to the power spectrum @xmath78 of the linear density field extrapolated to the present time by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the top - hat window function at the length scale @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the mean matter density .",
    "we utilise the analytical approximation specified in @xcite , relevant in the linear regime long after the relevant fluctuation modes have entered the horizon , when all modes grow at the same rate , which means that @xmath76 can be factored as a product of two functions , one solely dependent on redshift @xmath16 and the other solely dependent on the comoving spatial scale @xmath83 .",
    "we normalise @xmath84 and @xmath85 by computing @xmath85 at @xmath86mpc and setting the result equal to the cosmological parameter @xmath87 as measured by wmap , @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the first - crossing distribution @xmath89 has the following analytical fit @xcite to the n - body simulation results from the virgo consortium @xcite @xmath90\\left(\\frac{a\\nu}{2\\pi}\\right)^{1/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{a\\nu}{2}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is determined by the requirement that all mass lies within a given halo , i.e. @xmath94 or equivalently @xmath95 .",
    "since the rate of dm annihilation scales with density squared , it depends sensitively on the density profile of each halo .",
    "we consider three universal density profiles to model the smooth distribution of dm within each halo ( substructure will be dealt with later in this section ) .",
    "firstly , we consider the popular profile proposed by @xcite ( nfw ) , which corresponds to @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 in eq.([rho ] ) .",
    "secondly , we consider a profile with a significantly larger slope , specifically the one proposed by @xcite , corresponding to @xmath99 , @xmath97 and @xmath100 . both of these profiles have the same functional form and are both singular towards the galactic centre ( in fact",
    ", the slope of the moore profile must necessarily be truncated for @xmath101 , where @xmath102 - see below , otherwise the integral of density squared will diverge ) . however , there have been indications that cuspy profiles are inconsistent with observations , specifically regarding the rotation curves of small - scale galaxies @xcite , which are more likely to be consistent with density profiles possessing flattened cores similar to that which may be achieved with wdm @xcite .",
    "therefore , we lastly consider the burkert density profile @xcite : @xmath103\\left [ 1+(r / r_s)^{2}\\right ] } , \\label{burkert}\\ ] ] which has been shown to be fairly consistent with the rotation curves of a large number of spiral galaxies @xcite .      here",
    "we introduce the virial concentration parameter @xmath104 , defined by @xmath105 , where @xmath29 is the scale radius defined above and @xmath106 is the virial radius of the halo .",
    "the latter is defined as the radius encapsulating the virial mass @xmath64 of the halo within which the average density is equal to the overdensity @xmath107 times the average cosmological density @xmath108 at that redshift @xmath109 for @xmath107 , we use the approximation provided in @xcite , namely @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , ( @xmath112 at @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) .",
    "this is accurate to within 4% of the exact numerical calculation at relevant times .",
    "there has been evidence from simulations revealing a strong correlation between the halo mass @xmath64 and its corresponding concentration @xmath104 , with larger concentrations in smaller mass halos , which is consistent with the idea of bottom - up hierarchical structure formation with smaller halos collapsing at earlier times when the average density of the universe was much greater @xcite .",
    "this relationship was later re - affirmed by @xcite ( b2001 hereafter ) using a sample of simulated halos in the mass range @xmath116 , who proposed a toy model to describe this behaviour , which is popular in the relevant literature : on average , a collapse redshift @xmath117 is assigned to each halo of mass @xmath64 through the relation @xmath118 , where at a redshift @xmath16 the typical collapsing mass @xmath119 is defined implicitly by the relation @xmath120 and is postulated to be a fixed fraction @xmath121 of @xmath64 , which , following @xcite , we set equal to 0.015 .",
    "the density of the universe at redshift @xmath117 is then associated with a characteristic density of the halo at redshift @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , here we use the average concentration - mass relation obtained using the above method , which is given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 , for @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xcite    since this relation has been derived for halos with a minimum mass of @xmath128 , the extrapolation to very small values of the mass , down to the mass associated with the dm free streaming length ( that we take to be as small as @xmath129 ) , could be unreliable , since small mass halos become increasingly concentrated . for this reason , following @xcite , we introduce a cut - off mass @xmath130 such that @xmath131 for @xmath132 . in the following , we will either take @xmath130 equal to the mass of the smallest dm halos ( i.e. no cut - off ) or equal to @xmath133 , which is the typical ( mass ) resolution of current numerical simulations of galaxy - sized dm halos",
    ".      we are now able to calculate the clumping factor @xmath23 attributed to extragalactic halos with smooth dm density profiles and concentrations given by eq.([c - m ] ) .",
    "we start by calculating the annihilation rate @xmath63 within a dm halo of mass @xmath64 located at redshift @xmath16 given by @xmath134 the integral in ( [ eq : r ] ) can be expressed in analytical form for the nfw and moore profiles ; we present the relevant formulas in appendix [ app : clump ] . in the case of the moore profile , however , in order for the integral over density squared to be finite , the density must be truncated below a radius @xmath135 .    to obtain a value for @xmath136",
    "we assume that , within some minimum distance from the center of the halo , most of the neutralino dm has self - annihilated , leaving a flattened density core .",
    "the size of the core is roughly determined by the condition that within it the time - scale for dm annihilation , @xmath137 , should be smaller than the average time - scale @xmath138 for the replenishment of the core owing to the infall of dm from larger radii .",
    "then @xmath136 will be defined as the radius where @xmath139 .",
    "we do not try to estimate @xmath138 ; instead , since we must have @xmath140 , where @xmath141s is the hubble time , we have that within the core @xmath142 , and since the density decreases monotonically with increasing radius we can obtain a conservative upper limit for @xmath143 from the condition @xmath144 . then , we adopt the conservative criterion @xmath145 , with canonical values of the neutralino mass and annihilation cross section of @xmath146gev and @xmath147@xmath43s@xmath44 .",
    "this sets an upper limit for @xmath148 which is @xmath149 for the galactic halo at present day , which is consistent with similar approximations by other authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "an analysis of fig.[fig : fig1 ] reveals some interesting trends .",
    "firstly , moore profiles tend to yield larger clumping factors than nfw profiles , which in turn yield larger clumping factors than burkert profiles .",
    "this is clearly related to the relative cuspiness of the three profiles and the fact that dm annihilations are enhanced in higher - density regions . in general",
    ", we have that @xmath182 at @xmath183 is between @xmath184 and @xmath174 for moore profiles , @xmath185 and @xmath186 for nfw profiles , and @xmath187 and @xmath184 for burkert profiles .",
    "secondly , we observe that the smaller the value of @xmath188 the sooner the clumping factor starts to deviate from unity and the larger the clumping factor is at present day .",
    "this is due to the contribution in the integral in eq.([eq : gamma_halos ] ) of the smaller halos , that form earlier , and are thus denser , than larger halos .",
    "it is however worth stressing that the mass function and the concentration parameters have not been well measured for these extremely small , high - z halos .",
    "finally , when the bullock et al .",
    "relation is truncated at a value @xmath189 , the clumping factor is smaller . in particular , this roughly amounts to an order of magnitude difference at @xmath183 for the nfw and moore profiles with @xmath190 , and , as can be expected , the difference is smaller for larger values of @xmath188 and in the case of burkert profiles .",
    "thus far we have considered the amplification of the dm annihilation rate for isolated halos with smooth density profiles . however , as already mentioned , n - body simulations indicate that a significant proportion of the smaller progenitors giving rise to larger mass halos survive the merging processes and the tidal forces exerted upon them during their orbital motion within halos . in particular ,",
    "the via lactea ii @xmath24cdm simulations of galactic halos presented in @xcite and in @xcite ( kdm hereafter ) , revealed a second generation of surviving substructures within halos ( designated as `` sub - subhalos '' ) .",

    "we therefore adopt the value @xmath200 for both cdm and wdm .",
    "consequently , each subhalo mass decade contributes a constant fraction @xmath205 of the halo mass .",
    "adopting a course of reasoning analogous to that used to derive eq.([eq : r ] ) , the rate of dm annihilations within a similar halo , solely due to the subhalos within it , possessing smooth density profiles @xmath206 , is then given by @xmath207)4\\pi r^2 { \\rm d}r\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\langle\\sigma_{\\rm ann.}\\upsilon\\rangle}{2m_{\\rm dm}^2}a(m , f_{\\rm sub.})\\int\\limits^{10^{-2}m}_{m_{\\rm s}=m_{\\rm min.}}{\\rm d}m_{\\rm s } m_{\\rm s}^{-\\beta}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\int\\limits^{r_{\\rm vir.}(z , m_s)}_{r=0}\\rho^2(r , c_{\\rm vir.}^{\\rm sub.}[m_s , z])4\\pi r^2{\\rm d}r,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the appropriate normalisation of d@xmath208d@xmath191 .",

    "we find the same trends as in the case of smooth halos .",
    "however , the presence of substructures boosts the clumping factor , more effectively so for cuspier ( i.e. moore and nfw ) profiles and for smaller values of @xmath221 .",
    "in particular , we find that @xmath182 at @xmath183 is in the range between @xmath184 and @xmath222 for moore profiles , between @xmath185 and @xmath223 for nfw profiles , and between @xmath187 and @xmath224 for burkert profiles .    from the recursive structure of eq.([eq : c_subsub ] )",
    ", one can easily observe how to extend the present scenario to include higher generations of substructures , but since there is no evidence for such structures we omit them in this study .",
    "moreover , we have found that the relative contribution of halos , subhalos and sub - subhalos to @xmath225 is increasingly smaller at the redshifts of interest for realistic values of the concentration ratio @xmath226 and substructure fraction @xmath227 such that further generations of substructures , if they exist , are unlikely to increase @xmath225 by more than a few percent .",

    "a key quantity entering our computations is the fraction @xmath228 of energy produced in each dm annihilation that is effectively absorbed by the igm .",
    "in fact , taking @xmath229 would be quite a poor approximation as sometimes just a very small fraction of the total energy actually goes into the heating / ionisation of the igm .",
    "we describe in detail the method used to compute @xmath228 in appendix [ sec : app - fabs ] ; here we describe the annihilation spectra used for the different particle physics models that we adopt , provide some qualitative arguments to gain a physical insight on the mechanisms that lead to the absorption of particles , and finally , show the results obtained when the full method is invoked .",
    "neutralino dm can annihilate directly into either a fermion pair or weak gauge bosons . since the cross section for annihilation to fermion pairs is proportional to the square of the final state fermion mass , this process will be dominated by heavy final states , namely @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 ( if kinematically allowed ) , while direct annihilation into electron - positron pairs will be strongly suppressed .",
    "hence we need only consider the following annihilation modes : @xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "both the gauge bosons and the fermion pairs produced in neutralino annihilations will initiate a cascade that will eventually lead to a continuum of photons , neutrinos , electron / positrons pairs and protons in the final states , extending to energies much smaller than the rest mass of the dm particle . here",
    "we utilise pythia @xcite to calculate these spectra .",
    "the actual spectrum produced by the annihilations will depend on the branching ratios of the various channels ; this in turn will be determined by the gaugino and higgsino fractions of the neutralino . in the following",
    ", we will consider four representative supersymmetric scenarios , in a similar way to what was done by @xcite .",
    "first , we consider a 50gev neutralino with an annihilation branching ratio of 0.96 to @xmath230 and of 0.04 to @xmath238 ( designated as model 1 ) . such a particle could be gaugino - like or higgsino - like , since for masses below the gauge boson masses , these modes dominate for either case .",
    "second , we consider two cases for a 150gev neutralino : one ( designated as model 2 ) which annihilates as described in model 1 , and another ( designated as model 3 ) which annihillates entirely to gauge bosons ( @xmath239 or @xmath240 ) .",
    "such neutralinos are typically gaugino - like and higgsino - like respectively .",
    "finally , we consider heavy , 600gev neutralinos , which annihilate to @xmath241 with a ratio of 0.87 and to @xmath242 or @xmath243 the remaining time ( designated as model 4 ) .",
    "although these models do not fully encompass the extensive parameter space available to neutralinos at present , they do describe effective mssm benchmarks .",
    "furthermore , the relevant results for neutralinos with a mixture of the properties of those above can be inferred by interpolating between those presented .    in fig.[fig",
    ": spec_g ] we show the spectrum of photons and electrons produced in a single annihilation for our four neutralino models .",
    "as we shall describe in more detail in appendix [ sec : app - fabs ] , in the numerical computation of @xmath228 we will be make the approximation that the annihilation spectra are monochromatic and peaked at the average energy . in table[tab : av - en ] we show the average photon and electron energy for the four models described above , together with the average number of particles produced in each annihilation .",
    "in addition to neutralinos , we also consider light ( mev ) dm candidates , which annihilate directly into electron - positron pairs .",
    "this will result in a monochromatic spectrum with @xmath244 .",
    "we consider two different ldm candidates with masses @xmath245 and @xmath246 respectively . for completeness , we present the `` average '' energy and number of electrons ( which is equal to the number of positrons ) produced in each annihilation in table  [ tab : av - en ] ."
