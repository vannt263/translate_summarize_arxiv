    "_ @xcite found that a @xmath10 could be observed up to 2  tev with the right range of parameters .",
    "however , the littlest higgs model also predicts neutral ( @xmath11 ) and singly - charged ( @xmath12 ) members of the higgs triplet with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 interactions .",
    "if heavy scalars were observed , it would be necessary to map out their properties to construct the underlying lagrangian .",
    "for example , the @xmath15 vertex is unique to higgs triplet representations and does not exist in two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) , so the observation of this interaction would provide evidence for higgs triplets @xcite .",
    "the observation of a higgs triplet state would not , however , uniquely identify the model of origin @xcite .",
    "in addition to the littlest higgs model , scalar triplets are also included in the georgi - machacek model @xcite and left - right symmetric models @xcite .",
    "the so - called 3 - 3 - 1 models @xcite are another class of models that include higgs triplets @xcite . however , because 3 - 3 - 1 models are similar to variations of little higgs models , we will not consider them separately . to distinguish between models ,",
    "one therefore needs to study the properties of newly discovered scalar resonances . in this paper",
    ", we study vector boson scattering to determine whether it can be used to distinguish between models that include higgs triplet bosons .",
    "vector boson pair production was also considered as a signature of higgless models @xcite and other possibilities for new physics @xcite but we do not include these scenarios in this paper .",
    "higgs bosons can in principle couple to fermions and , in fact , a same sign dilepton final state would almost certainly be a cleaner signal for a doubly - charged higgs boson than vector boson final states .",
    "although this lepton number violating decay , @xmath16 , does not occur in the version of the littlest higgs model that we consider , it can occur in certain variations of the littlest higgs model @xcite , as well as in the georgi - machacek @xcite and left - right symmetric models @xcite .",
    "it is therefore worth commenting on the relative strengths of the dilepton and @xmath17 channels .",
    "neutrino masses are an important constraint on the allowed parameter range , which in turn leads to different decay scenarios for the higgs triplet states @xcite . in one case , the small neutrino mass can be driven by a tiny triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , but with neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath18 , while in the opposite scenario it is the yukawa couplings that are tiny to accomodate the observed neutrino masses .",
    "it is the latter case which can lead to a triplet vev that is large enough to give rise to the signal we are studying .    in this paper",

    "note that in the littlest higgs model , the scalar sector mixing angles are given to leading order by @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "this results in a value of zero for the @xmath139 vertex so we did not study the @xmath2 scattering process in the littlest higgs model . in the @xmath140 and @xmath141 vertices of the littlest higgs model",
    ", we did not include the @xmath142 terms in our calculations since their contributions are negligible for our purposes , regardless of the values of the mixing angles ( @xmath143 ) in the gauge sector of this model .",
    "it is interesting to note some of the similarities and differences in the feynman rules of each model .",
    "for example , the @xmath144 vertex has the same form in all three models .",
    "this is due to the fact that the doubly - charged member of the triplet has the same ew quantum numbers in each model .",
    "however , because the @xmath101 of the georgi - machacek model is a mixture of the @xmath145 and @xmath146 states , which have @xmath147 and @xmath148 respectively , this model does not have the same @xmath149 vertex as in the littlest higgs and left - right symmetric models .    in principle , one could also use vector boson scattering to study the production of the @xmath106 singlet in the georgi - machacek model . from the feynman rules in table [ tab : feynman ]",
    ", we see that it couples more strongly to the @xmath150 and @xmath97 bosons than the @xmath107 triplet does .",

    "hadronic decays of the vector bosons have the largest branching ratios",

    "these purely leptonic final states are often referred to as  gold - plated \" modes .",
    "a final possibility is to consider semileptonic final states , sometimes referred to as `` silver - plated '' modes , which are intermediate in terms of branching ratios and clean final states .",
    "as expertise for reconstructing vector bosons in hadronic modes improves , these final states could prove to be useful for studying vector boson scattering .",
    "however , in this paper we focus on the `` gold - plated '' leptonic final states .",
    "madgraph includes many diagrams with the same leptonic final state as the process in which we are interested .",
    "therefore , having madgraph calculate the full process including decays to final state leptons includes a very large number of non - resonant diagrams and takes considerable computing time .",
    "instead , we used madgraph to calculate the @xmath137 processes and subsequently decayed the vector bosons using the decay package of madgraph .",
    "we compared cross sections and distributions using both approaches and they agreed within the statistical uncertainties of the monte carlo .",
    "as a final check of our results , we calculated cross sections using the effective vector boson approximation @xcite and the goldstone equivalence theorem @xcite , and found that the two approaches were in reasonable agreement @xcite .",
    "madgraph includes a more complete set of feynman diagrams that contributes to the final states we are studying and , more importantly , includes the spectator jets which are a crucial ingredient for reducing backgrounds .",
    "at the high energies associated with tev scale higgs boson production at the lhc , the cross section for vector boson scattering is dominated by scattering of longitudinally polarized gauge bosons , @xmath155 , where @xmath156 .",
    "therefore , the signal process in which we are interested is @xmath157 with both vector bosons decaying leptonically . in general ,",
    "the experimental signature consists of high-@xmath158 leptons in the central region of the detector , two high-@xmath158 forward jets and low jet activity in the central region .",
    "we consider three types of backgrounds to this signal following the treatment of @xcite .",
    "the first background is the irreducible electroweak ( ew ) background .",
    "it is similar to the signal process except that at least one of the vector bosons is transversely polarized : @xmath159 this process is a background in the sense that its cross section is essentially insensitive to the new tev scale physics that we wish to study .",
    "it is irreducible in the sense that the final state is virtually identical to the signal process , differing only by the polarization of the vector bosons , making this background difficult to reduce using simple kinematic cuts . in principle , if one could distinguish between the final state vector boson polarizations , this background could be considerably reduced . a recent paper by han _",
    "argues that this can be done @xcite . in any case",
    ", we find that the cuts we implement reduce this background to a manageable level .",
    "we therefore define our signal cross section for tev scale higgs boson production through vector boson scattering as @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the cross section for the ew background process of the standard model , and @xmath162 includes the contributions from the higgs triplet model under consideration .",
    "the second class of background processes are qcd backgrounds , which involve the production of two vector bosons plus additional jets : @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the number of jets in the final state , typically with @xmath165 .",
    "we also include the 1-jet background because we only tag one forward jet in our analysis .",
    "it is possible to tag two high-@xmath158 forward jets , but such double tagging has been shown to be too costly to the number of signal events @xcite .",
    "therefore , we choose to tag a single forward jet in our analysis , as this retains a larger fraction of the signal events .",
    "we evaluate these backgrounds to order @xmath166 , where @xmath164 = 1 or 2 , in contrast to the irreducible ew background , which is of order @xmath167 .",
    "since the @xmath17 scattering signal is a purely electroweak process with no colour exchange and relatively low jet activity in the central region , the jets arising in the qcd background are generally more central and have higher @xmath168 than the spectator jets from the signal events .",
    "therefore , in addition to a forward jet tag , imposing a central jet veto to reject events with hard central jets is very useful in reducing the qcd background .",
    "the third type of background we consider includes top quarks in the final state , generally along with a vector boson and possibly an additional jet : @xmath169 these backgrounds arise from the leptonic decays of the vector boson , @xmath170 or @xmath97 , along with the @xmath4 and @xmath171 decaying into real @xmath150 bosons , which then decay leptonically or hadronically .",
    "the resulting final state can have many leptons and jets that can mimic the signal .",
    "fortunately , unlike the jets from the signal process , the jets from the @xmath4-quark background tend to emerge in the central region of the detector .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4-quark background can also be suppressed by imposing a forward jet tag and a central jet veto .    in the following subsections",
    "we give a more detailed description of the backgrounds to each of the final states and the kinematic cuts we use to reduce them to manageable levels .",
    "the sm backgrounds to the @xmath0 channel are :    * ew background : @xmath173 * qcd background : @xmath174 * top quark background : @xmath175 with @xmath176 . * @xmath1 background : @xmath177 with the @xmath178 and @xmath97 decaying leptonically , @xmath179 .",
    "this process is a background to the @xmath0 signal if the @xmath180 from the z decay is not observed , due to the finite coverage of the em calorimeter .",
    "we therefore include all the ew , qcd and @xmath4-quark backgrounds to the @xmath1 channel as backgrounds to the @xmath0 channel .",
    "we include the @xmath181 final state as well as the charge - conjugate @xmath182 final state to enhance our statistics in this channel .",
    "note that the cross sections for the two charge - conjugate channels are not identical due to different parton distribution functions contributing to the different charge states .    for the @xmath0 channel ,",
    "the leptonic decay mode in which we are interested is @xmath183 , where @xmath184 . because of the neutrinos in the final state",
    ", the @xmath150 boson pair can not be fully reconstructed .",
    "therefore , we consider the cluster transverse mass of the @xmath185 pair @xcite rather than the @xmath185 invariant mass distribution . in general , for a pair of vector bosons decaying leptonically , we define the cluster transverse mass as @xmath186 ^ 2 - \\left [ \\mathbf{p}_t^{leptons }   + \\not{\\ ! \\mathbf{p}}_t   \\right]^2 \\label{mt(vv)}\\ ] ] where @xmath187 , and @xmath188 is the invariant mass .",

    "all channels show qualitatively similar improvements in the signal to background ratio , so for the remaining channels we simply show the resulting mass distributions after imposing the kinematic cuts given in table  [ tab : cuts ] .",
    "the resulting cluster transverse mass distributions for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath19 channels , and the invariant mass distribution for the @xmath151 channel are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : w+w+_cuts]-[fig : zz_cuts ] for @xmath258 and 1.5  tev .    to better understand these plots , it is helpful to refer to the scalar triplet partial widths in these models , which are given in table  [ tab : widths ] .",
    "we start with the @xmath0 channel shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w+w+_cuts ] .",
    "the transverse mass distributions for all three models in the @xmath0 channel lie on top of each other because the doubly - charged member of the scalar triplet has identical @xmath259 vertices and the same decay width in each model .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath214 channel , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wz_cuts ] , exhibits differences between all three models .",
    "the peak width for the littlest higgs model signal is larger than that of the left - right symmetric model signal because , although they have the same @xmath260 vertex , the @xmath12 of the littlest higgs model can also decay to @xmath261 , resulting in a larger @xmath262 width .",
    "furthermore , although the @xmath263 of the georgi - machacek model can only decay to @xmath1 , as discussed previously , the @xmath264 coupling is larger by a factor of @xmath265 compared to the @xmath266 coupling in the left - right symmetric model , resulting in a @xmath263 width that is a factor of two larger than the @xmath267 width and also a larger production cross section .",
    "finally , the differential cross sections in the @xmath151 channel shown in figure [ fig : zz_cuts ] differ quite significantly due to the different @xmath268 couplings and @xmath11 widths .",
    "the width of the neutral member of the scalar triplet is smallest in the littlest higgs model , partially due to the absence of the @xmath269 decay mode at leading order in this model , but also due to the value of the @xmath268 coupling . in both the gm and lr models",
    "the @xmath11 can also decay @xmath19 which increases the total width .",
    "these effects are not so apparent in the @xmath19 channel because the signal is more deeply buried in the background .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the observability of a higgs triplet signal in a @xmath17 channel is determined by the relative size of the signal to background , and by the assumed integrated luminosity .",
    "so , for example , in the littlest higgs model with @xmath270  tev and @xmath115  gev , the cross section after cuts in the @xmath0 channel is 0.244  fb , compared to the cross section of the combined backgrounds of 0.0798  fb . assuming 100  fb@xmath5",
    ", this would result in roughly a @xmath271 effect .",
    "one could invert this and ask what luminosity would be required to produce a @xmath272 discovery ( i.e. @xmath273 ) .",
    "for this example , the luminosity required would be 34  fb@xmath5 , resulting in @xmath274 signal events",
    ". it may be possible to further optimize our cuts in order to enhance the event rate at the expense of lowering the signal to background ratio . in any case",
    ", there is a tradeoff and this would also depend on detector details that are beyond the scope of this paper . to ensure that a substantial number of signal events are observed , we impose a second criteria that there must be at least 10 signal events , resulting in a required integrated luminosity of 41  fb@xmath5 . following this procedure , in table [ tab : lumi ] we give the integrated luminosities required to produce a @xmath272 signal with at least 10 signal events for the various models for triplet masses of 1.0 and 1.5  tev .",
    "the early years of lhc running are expected to produce @xmath275 fb@xmath5/year .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that a heavy higgs triplet would be observed at the lhc in this period of time .",
    "once design luminosity is achieved , it is expected that @xmath276 fb@xmath5 will be produced per year . in this case",
    "it should be possible to observe a doubly - charged higgs triplet in any of these models with the assumed parameter values . in the @xmath214 channel",
    ", it seems that only the charged scalar in the georgi - machacek model could be observed .",
    "the @xmath277 channel is the least promising for observing a higgs triplet due to the large qcd and @xmath4-quark backgrounds in this channel .",
    "the values in tables [ tab : xsect ] and [ tab : lumi ] were obtained assuming a triplet vev of @xmath278 gev , which is the upper bound in the georgi - machacek model . however , in the littlest higgs model this parameter is constrained to @xmath279  gev , while in the left - right symmetric model the constraint is @xmath134  gev .",
    "the higgs triplet production cross section is proportional to @xmath280 , so , with these upper limits , the cross sections would be reduced by a factor of roughly @xmath281 and @xmath282 for the littlest higgs and left - right symmetric models respectively . with the resulting cross section values ,",
    "it is clear that to observe any of the tev - scale higgs triplet bosons of the littlest higgs or left - right symmetric models at the lhc using leptonic final states would require several @xmath283 of integrated luminosity and would await the slhc .",
    "however , as is usual in model building , it is possible that the existing constraints could be evaded , making these processes more useful than we pessimistically conclude .",
    "in this paper , we presented the results of a study of higgs triplet production via vector boson scattering at the lhc .",
    "the production cross sections are highly sensitive to the triplet vacuum expectation value ( @xmath87 ) which is already tightly constrained by precision electroweak data . of the three models considered",
    ", the georgi - machacek model can have the largest cross sections due to the weakest constraint on @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath0 channel is the most promising discovery channel due to its distinctive final state .",
    "however , it is still possible to observe a signal for the @xmath1 channel for certain regions of parameter space .",
    "the observation of this channel is a smoking gun for a higgs triplet , as this process does not occur in two higgs doublet models .",
    "discovery of the neutral higgs triplet state is least promising due to the large qcd and @xmath4-quark backgrounds in the @xmath2 channel and the small signal cross section in the @xmath284 channel .",
    "the @xmath285 channel might slightly improve the @xmath11 discovery potential , but we have not included this in our analysis and leave this for a future study .",
    "high luminosity is required for some of the channels and models , which will require the slhc .",
    "one of the goals of this work was to determine whether scalar triplet production via vector boson scattering at the lhc could be used to distinguish between models with higgs triplet bosons .",
    "our conclusions are qualified .",
    "the current constraints on the triplet vev in the littlest higgs and left - right symmetric models result in production cross sections that would require significant luminosity to be able to distinguish triplet scalars from standard model backgrounds , higher than the expected lhc luminosities . in these scenarios ,",
    "these measurements could at best constrain the allowed parameter space . however , if the @xmath0 and @xmath1 signals are observed , it would be possible to distinguish the three models we studied by computing the ratio of the rates in those two channels . in doing so , the dependence on the triplet vev cancels out , and this ratio would be sensitive to the details each model .",
    "we focused our work on the fully leptonic final states , which are easiest to distinguish from standard model backgrounds .",
    "the `` silver - plated '' semileptonic decay modes have significantly higher branching ratios and could potentially improve the statistics ; the branching ratios are @xmath286 versus @xmath287 , @xmath288 versus b(@xmath289 , and @xmath290 versus @xmath291 . however , much depends on the efficiency in reconstructing @xmath150 and @xmath97 bosons in their hadronic modes .",
    "in addition , the kinematic cuts would need to be modified to take into account the hadronic final states .",
    "we leave this excercise for a future study .",
