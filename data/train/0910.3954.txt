    "star clusters , _ e.g. _ , globular clusters ( henceforth gc ) , young and intermediate - age massive clusters and open clusters harbor a large overdensity of compact stellar remnants compared to that in the field by virtue of their high density and the mass segregation of the compact remnants towards the cluster core @xcite",
    ". these compact stars , which are neutron stars ( henceforth ns ) and black holes ( henceforth bh ) , are produced by the stellar evolution of the most massive stars within the first @xmath6 50 myr after cluster formation .",
    "these compact stars , being generally heavier than the remaining low - mass stars of the cluster , segregate quickly ( within one or a few half - mass relaxation times ) to the cluster core , forming a dense sub - cluster of compact stars .",
    "such a compact - star sub - cluster is of broad interest as it efficiently produces compact - star binaries through dynamical encounters @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ , x - ray binaries and ns - ns and bh - bh binaries , which are of interest for a wide range of physical phenomena .",
    "for example , x - ray binaries are the primary sources of gc x - ray flux , while mergers of tight ns - ns binaries ( through emission of gravitational waves ) is the most likely scenario for the production of short duration grbs and both ns - ns and bh - bh mergers are very important sources of gravitational waves ( henceforth gw ) detectable by future gravitational wave observatories like `` advanced ligo '' ( adligo ) and `` lisa '' @xcite .",
    "double - ns systems are also interesting because they could be observable as double - pulsar systems @xcite , allowing important tests of general relativity @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the dynamics of stellar - mass bhs in star clusters , with particular emphasis on dynamically formed bh - bh binaries .",
    "such binaries are strong sources of gws as they spiral - in through gw radiation , a process detectable out to several thousand mpc distances .",
    "tight bh binaries that can merge within a hubble time can also be produced in the galactic field from tight stellar binaries , which result from stellar evolution of the components ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite have shown with revised binary - evolution models that the majority of potential bh - bh binary progenitors actually merge because of common envelope ( ce ) evolution which occurs when any of the binary members crosses the hertzsprung gap .",
    "they found that this reduces the merger rate by a factor as large as @xmath7 and the resulting adligo detection rate of bh - bh binary mergers in the universe from primordial binaries is only @xmath8 yr@xmath9 , subject to the uncertainties of the ce evolution model that has been incorporated .",
    "note that the corresponding ns - ns merger rate , as the above authors predict , is considerably higher , @xmath10 yr@xmath9 .",
    "in view of the above result , the majority of merging bh binaries are possibly those that are formed dynamically in star clusters .    as studied by several authors earlier @xcite , black holes , formed through stellar evolution , segregate into the cluster core within @xmath11 pc and form a sub - cluster of bhs , where the density of bhs is large enough that bh - bh binary formation through 3-body encounters becomes important @xcite .",
    "these dynamically formed bh binaries then `` harden '' through repeated super - elastic encounters with the surrounding bhs @xcite . the binding energy of the bh binaries released is carried away by the single and binary bhs involved in the encounters .",
    "this causes the bhs and the bh binaries to get ejected from the bh - core to larger radii of the cluster and they heat the cluster while sinking back to the core through dynamical friction @xcite .",
    "most of the energy of the sinking bhs is deposited in the cluster core as the stellar density is much higher there . as the bh binaries harden , the encounter - driven recoil becomes stronger and finally the recoil is large enough that the encountering single bh and/or the bh binary escape from the cluster ( see sec .",
    "[ res ] , also @xcite ) .",
    "because of the associated mass - loss from the cluster core , this also results in cluster heating . these heating mechanisms result in an expansion of the cluster , as studied in detail by several authors , _ e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "@xcite found notable agreement between the core expansion as obtained from their n - body simulations with the observed age - core radius correlation for star clusters in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the dynamics of stellar mass bhs and formation of bh binaries in star clusters and the resulting rate of gw emission from close enough bh binaries has been studied by several authors using n - body integrations @xcite , numerical 3-body scattering experiments @xcite or monte - carlo methods @xcite . @xcite",
    "considered the rate of mergers of escaping bh binaries from various stellar systems , _",
    "e.g. _ , massive gcs , young populous clusters and galactic nuclei .",
    "they estimated the merger rates within 15 gyr ( their adopted age of the universe ) by assuming the binding - energy ( @xmath12 ) distribution of the escaping bh binaries to be uniformly distributed in @xmath13 , as inferred from simulations of @xmath14 or 4000 star clusters ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "considering the space - densities of the different kinds of star clusters , they found that while for ligo the corresponding total ( _ i.e. _ , contribution from all types of star clusters ) detection rate is negligible , it can be as high as @xmath15 day@xmath9 for adligo . @xcite",
    "performed sequential numerical integrations of bh binary - single bh close encounters in a uniform stellar background , where , in between successive encounters , the bh - binaries were evolved due to gw emission . from such simulations , these authors studied the growth of bhs through successive bh - binary mergers for the first time . in a more self - consistent study of the growth of bhs and the possibility of formation of intermediate mass black holes through successive bh - binary mergers",
    ", @xcite used the monte - carlo approach and considered `` pure '' bh clusters that are dynamically detached from their parent clusters which can be expected to form due to mass stratification instability @xcite .",
    "these authors considered dynamically formed bh binaries from 3-body encounters in such bh clusters utilizing theoretical cross - sections of 3-body binary formation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , they included both binary - single and binary - binary encounters .",
    "considering the sub - set of bh binaries formed in the bh clusters that merge within a hubble time , they determined typically a few adligo detections per year for old gcs .",
    "while such results are remarkable and promising , a more detailed study of the dynamics of stellar - mass bhs in star clusters with a realistic number of stars is essential . as the cross - sections of different processes governing the dynamics of bh binaries , _ viz .",
    "_ , 3-body binary formation , binary - single star encounters and ionization have different dependencies on the number of stars @xmath16 of the cluster , an extrapolation to much different @xmath16 can be problematic . hence it is important to consider clusters with values of @xmath16 appropriate for massive clusters or gcs .",
    "also , exact treatments of the various dynamical processes are crucial for realistic predictions of bh - bh merger rates .",
    "finally , a more careful study of the different dynamical processes leading to the formation and evolution of bh binaries in star clusters is needed to understand better under which conditions tight inspiralling bh binaries can be formed dynamically from a star cluster .    in the present work ,",
    "we make a detailed study of the dynamics of bh - bh binaries formed in a bh sub - cluster , as introduced above . in particular",
    ", we investigate whether hard enough bh binaries that can merge via gravitational radiation in a hubble time within the cluster or after getting ejected from the cluster , can be formed in such a sub - cluster . to that end , we perform direct n - body integrations of concentrated star clusters ( half - mass radius @xmath17 pc ) consisting of @xmath18 low - mass stars in which a certain number of stellar - mass bhs is added , representing a star cluster with an evolved stellar population .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sim ] we describe our simulations in detail .",
    "we discuss the various elements and assumptions of the simulations and summarize all the runs that we perform ( sec .",
    "[ runs ] ) .",
    "we also discuss the use of a reflective boundary to simulate only the core of a star cluster ( sec .",
    "[ reflct ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ res ] we discuss our results with particular emphasis on the dynamical bh binaries formed during the simulations .",
    "we discuss the bh - bh mergers that occur within the clusters and also the merger timescales of the bh binaries that escape from the clusters ( sec .",
    "[ mrgesc ] ) and obtain the distributions of merger - times for both cases ( sec .  [ tdist ] ) . finally , in sec .  [ discuss ]",
    "we interpret our results in the context of different types of star clusters that are observed and provide estimates of bh - bh merger detection rates .",
    "of a star cluster with a reflective sphere . shown is the evolution of the run r3k180 of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "a rapid initial heating is observed , caused by super - elastic encounters between bhs , followed by a saturation of the heating curve , caused by the enhanced escape rate of stars due to the heating ( see text).,width=321 ]    to study the dynamics of bhs in star clusters , we perform direct n - body simulations using nbody6 with star clusters in which a certain number of bhs are added initially .",
    "the initial density distribution follows a plummer model with half - mass radius @xmath17 pc consisting of @xmath18 low - mass main - sequence stars in the mass - range @xmath19 .",
    "observed half mass radii for gcs and open clusters are usually larger , but as we expect the clusters to expand considerably due to the heating caused by the encounters in the bh core ( see sec .",
    "[ intro ] ) , we begin with more concentrated clusters .",
    "black holes formed through stellar evolution are typically within the mass - range @xmath20 for stellar progenitors with solar - like metallicity @xcite .",
    "the exact form of the bh mass - function is still debated and depends on the metallicity of the parent stellar population and the stellar wind mass - loss model @xcite . in a dense stellar environment it is further affected by the frequent stellar mergers and binary coalescence @xcite . in view of the uncertainty of the bh mass - function , we consider only equal - mass bhs , with @xmath21 in this work .",
    "such a value was also assumed by earlier authors , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a specified number of bhs are added to each cluster , and we assume that the bhs follow the same spatial distribution as the stars initially .",
    "the number of bhs added depends on the bh retention fraction .",
    "we explore both full retention and the case where half of the bhs are ejected from the cluster by natal kicks .",
    "with such a cluster , we mimic the epoch at which massive stars have already evolved and produce bhs . while such a cluster is not completely representative of the more realistic case in which the bhs are produced from stellar evolution during the very early phases , it still serves the purpose of studying the dynamics of the bhs since this becomes important only later after segregation of the bhs into the cluster core ( see sec .",
    "[ res ] ) .",
    "we perform our simulations using nbody6 code @xcite enabled for use with graphical processing units ( gpu ) .",
    "we have made arrangements in nbody6 to put a specified number @xmath22 of bhs of a given mass @xmath23 by picking stars randomly from the cluster and replacing them by the bhs .",
    "necessary rescalings have been done to compensate for the excess mass gained by the cluster .",
    "these runs are performed on nvidia 9800 gx2/gtx 280/gtx 285 gpu platforms , located at the argelander - institut fr astronomie ( aifa ) , university of bonn , germany , with the gpu enabled version of nbody6 ( see @xcite ) .      to evolve the bh - bh binaries due to gw emission , peters formula @xcite",
    "is utilized in nbody6 ( also see @xcite ) , which provides approximate orbit - averaged rates of evolution of binary semi - major axis @xmath24 and eccentricity @xmath25 due to gw emission . according to this formula , the merger time @xmath26 of an equal - mass bh - bh binary due to gw emission is given by @xmath27    peters formula is limited up to the mass quadrapole terms of the radiating system .",
    "close to the merger , higher order pn terms become important , which modifies the above value of the merger time @xcite . in the present work",
    "however , we are primarily interested in an overall statistics of the merger events rather than the detailed orbit of a single bh - bh merger , so that the higher order pn corrections are not crucial . hence we restrict ourselves to peters formula . moreover ,",
    "the orbit of a tight bh - bh binary gets modified by dynamical encounters , which will anyway modify its merger time to a much larger extent compared to that for the unperturbed binary with the higher pn terms .    in nbody6 ,",
    "the orbital evolution of compact binaries is also considered when the binary is inside a hierarchy .",
    "thus a tight bh binary will continue to shrink even if it acquires an outer member forming a hierarchical triple , which can often happen due to the strong focussing effect of bh binaries .",
    "also , energy removal due to gw ( bursts ) during a close hyperbolic passage between two bhs is considered in the code .",
    "numerical simulations of bh - bh mergers ( see @xcite for an excellent review ) indicate that for unequal - mass bhs or even for equal - mass bhs with unequal spins , the merged bh product acquires a velocity - kick of typically 100 km s@xmath9 or more due to an asymmetry in momentum outflow from the system , associated with the gw emission .",
    "although we consider equal - mass bhs , the merger kicks associated with the inequality of the spins of the merging bhs would be generally sufficient to eject merged bhs from the cluster .",
    "therefore , in our simulations we provide an arbitrarily large kick of 150 km s@xmath9 immediately after a bh - bh merger , to make sure that the merged bh escapes .      to study the rate of bh - bh mergers coming from a star cluster , we perform simulations of isolated star clusters with single low - mass stars and bhs as mentioned above .",
    "the formation of the bh - core through mass segregation and its dynamics remain largely unaffected by the presence of a tidal field , which mainly affects stars near the tidal boundary .",
    "while the enhanced removal of stars accelerates the core - collapse of the cluster ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite , ch .",
    "3 ) , the latter is more strongly enhanced by the collapse of the bhs themselves ( @xmath2 myr timescale , see below ) , so that the effect of any tidal field is only second - order .",
    "hence , isolated clusters are good enough for our purposes .",
    "further , for simplicity , we do not take into account primordial binaries in this initial study .",
    "the primordial binary fraction in gcs and their period distribution is still widely debated @xcite .",
    "the presence of a primordial binary population can however significantly influence the dynamics of stellar - mass bhs which we defer for a future more detailed study .    for solar - like",
    "metallicity , eggleton s stellar evolution model ( @xcite , adapted in nbody6 ) gives about @xmath28 bhs for a cluster with @xmath29 stars following a kroupa imf @xcite .",
    "the above @xmath22 ( or its proportion with @xmath16 ) is thus an upper limit to the number of bhs in a gc that corresponds to a full retention ( _ i.e. _ , no or low natal kicks for all bhs ) .",
    "we perform 2 simulations with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , 2 runs with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , _",
    "i.e. _ , about full bh - retention .",
    "two of the above runs are repeated with half the above @xmath22s .",
    "also , one run with @xmath34 and excess @xmath35 , appropriate for a top - heavy imf has been performed .",
    "finally , we do 2 runs with @xmath36 with @xmath37 ( about 50% retention fraction ) and @xmath38 ( full retention ) .",
    "all the clusters consist of low - mass stars between @xmath39 with a kroupa imf and the bhs have @xmath21 , as discussed in detail in the beginning of the section .",
    "in addition to these systems , we also study stellar - mass bhs in clusters with smaller @xmath16 representing open clusters , in order to estimate the lower - limit in cluster mass for the occurrence of bh - bh mergers .",
    "we perform 10 runs with @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 each with full bh - retention ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively ) . results of all our runs are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .       vs. time @xmath46 ( top panel ) of all bhs for model c50k80 of table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "the advantage of this approach is that one can simulate the evolution of a massive cluster with much fewer stars .",

    "this is done in the main integration loop . for these stars ,",
    "we compute the force polynomials @xcite separately ( using the cpu ) which makes the code slower by factors of 2 - 3 depending on the stellar density .",
    "while the behavior of a n - body code in presence of a reflective boundary needs to be studied in more detail , the present implementation seems to be fairly stable with single - stars and bhs , with energy errors marginally larger than that for a free cluster .",
    "( in fact , in the nbody6 package , some routines are already available for optionally implementing the reflective boundary ) . for stars and bhs beyond a pre - assigned speed @xmath52 , representing the escape speed of the host cluster ,",
    "we do allow them to escape through the reflective boundary .",
    "it is of course important to note that a cluster simulation within a reflective boundary can not represent the evolution of a free cluster , in particular , since the cluster expands due to the bh - heating which continually reduces the stellar density in the core . with the reflective boundary ,",
    "the stellar density still decreases because of the escape of stars with speed @xmath53 , but it generally does not mimic the cluster expansion .",
    "the cooling effect of these escaping stars also helps to inhibit the runaway heating of the cluster due to the binding energy released by binary - star / binary - binary encounters .",

    "the latter effect in turn increases the cooling rate so that @xmath57 finally tends to flatten to a value for which the dynamical heating is balanced by the escape - cooling of the cluster . for the reflective boundary clusters used in our simulations ( see above ) ,",

    "these encounters include both flybys and exchanges with single bhs . when the binary is wide , and the recoils it receives are low , so that it usually remains in the cluster .",

    "old globular clusters , which can be about 10 times or more massive , are expected to produce mergers or escapers more efficiently . as the timescale of depletion of bhs from the bh cluster is nearly independent of the parent cluster mass ( see sec .",

    "i.e. _ , within the first few gyr of evolution . since gcs",

    "considering the light - travel time of @xmath122 from the maximum distance @xmath123 form which these bh - bh binaries can be detected by `` adligo''(see below ) , only gcs close to the above distance could contribute detectable events , mostly from escaped bh - bh binaries .",
    "on the other hand , young massive clusters with ages less than 50 myr , representing star clusters near the high - mass end of the icmf @xcite , are generally too young to produce bh - bh mergers .",
    "all models in table  [ tab1 ] produce mergers significantly later than this age ( except one escaped bh binary in each of the models c65k110 and c100k200 ) .",
    "hence , imcs seem to be most likely candidates for producing observable bh - bh mergers dynamically .",
    "we now make an estimate of the bh - bh merger detection rate from imcs by ground - based gw observatories like ligo and adligo . in estimating the overall bh - bh merger rate using the results of our model clusters",

    "_ , cluster mass , half - mass radius , and bh retention fraction .",
    "such distributions are far from being well determined , except for the mass distribution for young clusters in spiral and starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore , determination of an overall merger rate considering the distribution of our computed clusters can be ambiguous .",
    "hence , as a useful alternative , we determine the bh binary merger detection rates for each of the cluster models in table  [ tab1 ] that gives an appreciable number of mergers , for a representative density of imcs .",
    "such an approach has been considered by earlier authors , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and can provide a reasonable idea of the rate of detection of bh - bh mergers from imcs .    as an estimate of the space density of imcs , we adopt that for young populous clusters in @xcite , which has a similar mass - range as the imcs : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the hubble parameter , defined as @xmath126 , @xmath127 being the hubble constant @xcite .",
    "the above space density has been derived from the space densities of spiral , blue elliptical and starburst galaxies @xcite assuming that young populous clusters have the same specific frequencies ( @xmath128 ) as old gcs @xcite , but in absence of any firm determination of the @xmath128s of the former .",
    "we compute the detection rate for each model cluster assuming that it has a space density of the above value .",
    "the ligo / adligo detection rate of bh - bh mergers from a particular model cluster can be estimated from ( @xcite and references therein ) @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the compact binary merger rate from a cluster and @xmath131 is the maximum distance from which the emitted gw from a compact - binary inspiral can be detected .",
    "@xmath131 is given by @xmath132 where @xmath133 and 300 mpc for ligo and adligo respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath134 is the `` chirp mass '' of the compact binary with component masses @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which is given by @xmath137 and @xmath138 is that for a binary with two @xmath139 neutron stars .    for a bh binary with @xmath140 , @xmath141 which gives @xmath142 for adligo .",
    "the adligo detection rates @xmath98 ( mean over 3 gyr taking into account the time of escape @xmath106 of the escaped binaries ) for the model clusters are shown in table  [ tab1 ] , where the currently accepted value of the hubble parameter @xmath143 is assumed .",
    "the error in each detection rate is simply obtained from the poisson dispersion of the total number of mergers for the corresponding cluster .",
    "note that these detection rates are for clusters with solar - like metallicity which is implied by our assumption of @xmath144 bhs for all the clusters .    to obtain a basic estimate of the overall detection rate of bh - bh mergers from imcs",
    ", we consider the subset of our computed models that are isolated clusters with full bh retention ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we take the mass function of the imcs to be a power law with index @xmath145 which is the approximate index of the icmf in spiral and starburst galaxies ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "then the weighted average of the corresponding adligo detection rates is @xmath146 yr@xmath9 , which estimates the total present - day detection rate of bh - bh mergers from imcs expected for adligo .",
    "the corresponding ligo detection rate is negligible , @xmath147 .",
    "note that these bh - bh detection rates are only lower limits .",
    "first , the observed population of star clusters can be an underestimation by a factor of 2 owing to their dissolution in the tidal field of their host galaxies ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "second , the above detection rates are only from imcs and there can be additional contributions from gcs ( see above ) .    in comparing the adligo detection rates from our computations with those from earlier works , we note that our rates are typically an order of magnitude smaller than those of @xcite , but about one order of magnitude larger than those obtained by @xcite .",
    "the principal origin of the former difference is due to the fact that while we considered only imcs distinguishing them as the most appropriate candidates for producing present - day bh - bh mergers ( see above ) , @xcite also included gcs , which have considerably larger spatial density and also larger fraction of bh - bh binaries merging within the hubble time , as obtained from their analytic extrapolations .",
    "note that the number of escapers as obtained by them for young populous clusters and the fraction of them merging within a hubble time ( see table  1 of @xcite ) is similar to that obtained from the present computations , implying qualitative agreement .",
    "the above authors apparently did not consider the time scales of formation and depletion of the bh sub - systems in their preliminary study .",
    "on the other hand , although @xcite considered clusters significantly more massive than our s in their monte - carlo approach , so that larger merger detection rates can be expected , their clusters were much older ( 8 gyr and 13 gyr ) than imcs which , in accordance with our results , accounts for their much lower detection rate .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dynamical bh - bh merger detection rates obtained by us are typically an order of magnitude higher than that from primordial stellar binaries as predicted by @xcite based on their revised binary evolution model , and is similar to that for the isolated ns - ns binaries derived by them .",
    "hence our results imply that dynamical bh - bh binaries constitute the dominant contribution to the bh - bh merger detection .",
    "thus , the dynamical bh - bh inspirals from star clusters seem to be a promising channel for gw detection by the future adligo , although their estimated detection rate with the present ligo detector is negligible , in agreement with the hitherto non - detection of gw .",
    "the work presented here is a first step towards a detailed study of the dynamics of stellar - mass bhs in star clusters and the consequences for gw - driven bh mergers , and improvements in several directions are possible .",
    "first , we do not consider the initial phase of the cluster here when bhs form through stellar evolution and a more consistent approach would be to begin with a star cluster with a full stellar spectrum and produce the bhs from stellar evolution .",
    "note however that in the present study we have inserted numbers of bhs in our clusters of low - mass stars similar to what would have been formed from the stellar evolution of a cluster following a kroupa imf ( see sec .",
    "[ runs ] ) .",
    "stellar evolution also produces nss ( about twice in number as the bhs ) which also segregate to the central region of the cluster .",
    "it is interesting to study the dynamics of the ns cluster and how it is affected by the ( more concentrated ) bh cluster  in particular the formation of tight inspiralling ns - ns and ns - bh binaries , which are important for both gw detection and grbs .",
    "another aspect that we do not consider in our present study is the effect of primordial stellar binaries .",
    "tight stellar binaries aid the formation of compact binaries through double - exchanges @xcite , in addition to the 3-body mechanism ( see sec .",
    "[ intro ] ) which can increase the number bh - bh ( also bh - ns and ns - ns ) binaries formed and hence the merger rate .",
    "thus the study of bh - bh binaries in star clusters with primordial binaries is an important next step .",
    "such studies are in progress and will be presented in future papers .    finally , the number of n - body computations in this initial study is not enough to obtain the bh - bh merger rate as a function of cluster mass and bh retention fraction with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "there are typically one integration per cluster model . to obtain merger rate dependencies with cluster parameters , _",
    "e.g. _ , mass , half mass radius , binary fraction and bh retention , many computations are needed within smaller intervals , which involves much larger time and computing capacity than that utilized for the present project .",
    "such results , combined with improved knowledge of cluster parameter distributions and bh formation through supernova explosions of massive stars , would provide a robust estimate of the bh - bh merger detection rate .",
    "conversely , with such a merger rate function , the detection of bh - bh mergers by gw detectors like adligo in the near future will shed light on the above mentioned long - standing questions .",
