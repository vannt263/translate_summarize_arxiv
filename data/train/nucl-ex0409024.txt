    "in pp , pa or aa collisions at rhic , the high @xmath2 part of the hadron spectra is dominated by the two - body hard - scattering process . in this process ,",
    "the two scattered partons typically appear as a pair of almost back - to - back jets .",
    "the properties of the di - jet system can be characterized by the jet fragmentation momentum , @xmath3 , the parton transverse momentum , @xmath4 , and the fragmentation function , @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the spread of hadrons around the jet axis , the relative orentation of the back - to - back jets and the jet multiplicity , respectively .    traditionally , energetic jets were reconstructed directly using standard jet finding algorithms@xcite . in heavy - ion collisions , due to the large amount of soft background ,",
    "direct jet reconstruction is difficult .",
    "even in pa or pp collisions , the range of energy accessible to direct jet reconstruction is probably limited to @xmath6 gev  @xcite , below which the ` underlying event ' background contamination become important .",
    "the situation is even more complicated for finite acceptance detectors like phenix due to the leakage of the jet cone outside the acceptance .",
    "the two - particle - correlation technique provides an alternative way to access the properties of the jet .",
    "it is based on the fact that the fragments are tightly correlated in azimuth @xmath7 and pseudo - rapidity @xmath8 and the jet signal manifests itself as a narrow peak in @xmath9 and @xmath10 space .",
    "the jet properties are extracted statistically by accumulating many events .",
    "this method was initially used in 70 s in searching for jet signals in pp collisions at cern isr  @xcite .",
    "it overcomes problems with the underlying event background , probes the jet signal at lower @xmath2 , and has recently excited renewed interest at rhic  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , jet measurement is challenging due to detector inefficiency and limited experimental acceptance .",
    "a certain fraction of jet pairs is lost either because the track is not found or because part of the jet cone falls outside the acceptance .",
    "the average jet pair detection efficiency can be estimated statistically using event mixing technique .",
    "the main goal of the paper is to establish the procedures for measuring the jet shape and jet multiplicity independent of the detector efficiency and acceptance .",
    "the discussion is split into three sections . in section.[sec : formula ] , we lay out the formulae for extracting @xmath3 , @xmath4 and conditional yield . in the interest of space ,",
    "the reader is encouraged to see ref.@xcite for more details on the definition of the variables . in section.[sec : acceptance ] , we discuss the event mixing technique necessary in correcting for limited acceptance and inefficiency , where we use the phenix detector as an example .",
    "we discuss separately the two dimensional ( @xmath10 , @xmath9 ) and one dimensional ( @xmath9 ) correlation and derive the normalization factors for the conditional yield in each case . in section.[sec : simulation ] we verify the procedure of correcting for finite acceptance with pythia simulation .",
    "fig.[fig : frag ] illustrates the single jet fragmentation ( left panel ) and away side jet fragmentation ( right panel ) . the jet fragmentation momentum , @xmath3 , and parton initial momentum , @xmath4 , determine the relative orientation of the fragmented hadrons .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are vectors , their projection in the azimuthal plane perpendicular to the jet direction are denoted as @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for single jet fragmentation ,",
    "if we denote @xmath9 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 as the angles between trigger - associated , trigger - jet and associated - jet , respectively , then the following relations are true : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the component of associated particle @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) perpendicular to the trigger particle @xmath2 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath13 and @xmath14 are statistically independent , we have ( cross terms average to 0 ) , @xmath20     +    similarly for the far - side correlation , we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the angle between the two jets . expanding @xmath23 and dropping all cross terms ( which average to 0 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath24    let s define @xmath25 and @xmath26 . if @xmath22 is small , or @xmath27 , then @xmath28 , @xmath29 @xmath4 only affects the jet direction .",
    "thus statistically we obtain @xmath30 substituting the @xmath31 and @xmath32 terms from eq .",
    "[ eq : sinnear ] and [ eq : sinfar ] into eq .",
    "[ eq : jt1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : kt1 ] , we obtain the equations for the rms value of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( for a given variable @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 . assuming the @xmath9 follows gaussian statistics , a simple taylor expansion connects @xmath38 with the jet width , @xmath39 : @xmath40\\\\ & = & \\mean{p_{t , asso}^2}[sin\\sigma^2-\\sigma^4]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by replacing the @xmath38 terms in eq.[eq : jt1 ] and eq.[eq : kt1 ]",
    ", we can derive the relation between jet width and rms value of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    since eq .",
    "[ eq : jt2 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : kt3 ] contain variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 that depend on @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we have to calculate @xmath43 and @xmath44 iteratively .",
    "however when trigger and associated particle @xmath2 are much larger than typical @xmath3 value , the near side jet width @xmath45 is small and @xmath46 .",
    "hence eq .",
    "[ eq : jt2 ] can be simplified to , @xmath47 for the far - side correlation , if the trigger @xmath2 is much larger than @xmath12 and @xmath11 , then @xmath48 , @xmath49 and eq .",

    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : frag1 ] , there are good agreements for @xmath11 , except at low @xmath18 where the @xmath45 become big and eq.[eq : expan ] has to be used . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath56 value from this analysis is 10% lower than the one calculated by eq.[eq : kt3 ] .",
    "the difference could be caused by small angle approximation used in eq.[eq : kt3 ] , but may also due to the difference between rms and mean : for given variable @xmath57 in a finite range , @xmath58 .",
    "there is a dropping trend in the @xmath56 value as function of @xmath18 in both cases .",
    "this trend can be explained by the trigger bias effects  @xcite , which we briefly touch on in the next section .",
    "c     +      the jet fragmentation function , @xmath5 or @xmath59 , represents the associated yield per jet , @xmath60 where @xmath61 , when the jet energy @xmath62 is fixed .",
    "if the two particles come from the same jet , the two particle multiplicity distribution can be described by the di - hadron fragmentation function , @xmath63 the conditional fragmentation function , where the @xmath2 of one particle is fixed , can be expressed by , @xmath64    experimentally , we measure jet properties from two particle azimuthal correlation .",
    "the jet signal typically appears as two distinct peaks in @xmath9 , i.e. at @xmath65 for same jet and at @xmath66 for away side jet . by fitting the peaks with gaussian function , we extract the associated hadron yield per trigger or the conditional yield ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of trigger particles , and @xmath70 is the number of jet pairs in a fixed @xmath9 and @xmath10 bin .",
    "since @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the @xmath67 integrated over the same jet ( around @xmath65 ) directly corresponds to the conditional fragmentation function .",
    "unfortunately , the fragmentation variable @xmath73 is not directly accessible in the correlation method .",
    "instead , @xmath67 is often expressed as function of a different variable @xmath74  @xcite , defined as @xmath75 .    the di - hadron fragmentation function ( eq.[eq : cond1 ] ) , conditional fragmentation function ( eq.[eq : cond2 ] ) and conditional yield ( eq.[eq : cond3 ] )",
    "are defined for the near side correlation for which the two particles belong to the same jet .",
    "they can be extended to describe the correlation of the two particles from the back - to - back jets . in this case",
    ", eq.[eq : cond2 ] represents the hadron - triggered fragmentation function similar to the one used in  @xcite . in a naive parton - parton scattering picture and for fixed jet energy , the fragmentation of the away side jet and triggering jet",
    "can be factorized , i.e. @xmath76 . thus the @xmath67 is related to the unbiased fragmentation function by a scale factor , @xmath77 , @xmath78 @xmath77 was found to be around 0.75 - 0.95 at isr  @xcite for high @xmath2 leading pions ( 4 - 12 gev / c ) and scales with @xmath79 in @xmath80  @xcite .    in reality , due to the intrinsic @xmath4 or radiative corrections , the independent fragmentation assumption for parton - parton scattering is not strictly valid .",
    "in addition , for given given @xmath19 , the original jet energy is not fixed , but depends on the @xmath18 , which implies that @xmath81 also depends on @xmath18 .",
    "this can be easily understood from the fact that the fractional momentum ca nt exceed 1 : @xmath82 , while @xmath74 is not bounded from above : @xmath83 .",
    "simple simulation indicates that @xmath81 is relatively stable when @xmath84 , but quickly decrease when @xmath18 is larger than @xmath19  @xcite . in summary , these bias effects , caused by the requirement of a trigger hadron on the opposite side , makes eq.[eq : cond4 ] at best an approximation .",
    "the trigger bias effect is also responsible for the decreasing of @xmath56 seen in fig.[fig : frag1 ] .",
    "for a detector with limited aperture , a fraction of the jet cone falls outside the acceptance .",
    "the fractional loss depends on the jet direction : the loss for jet pointing to the corner of the detector is larger than jet pointing to the center of the detector . assuming the jet production rate is uniform in azimuth direction @xmath7 and pseudo - rapidity @xmath8",
    ", we can construct an average pair acceptance function using event mixing technique ( one trigger particle is randomly combined with an associated particle from a different event . )",
    "@xmath85 @xmath86 represents the background level when the associated particle is not constrained .",
    "given the limited phenix @xmath8 coverage , it is safe to assume that @xmath86 is constant  @xcite .",
    "@xmath87 is the pair acceptance function , which represents the probability of detecting the associated particle when the trigger particle is detected .",
    "the phenix ideal single particle acceptance is shown in fig.[fig : acc]a : @xmath88,[123.75^\\circ,213.75^\\circ]$ ] and @xmath89 .",
    "the tracking efficiency has been assumed to be 100% .",
    "the corresponding pair acceptance can be constructed by convoluting the single acceptance for trigger and associated particle and is shown in fig.[fig : acc]b for @xmath10 and fig.[fig : acc]c for @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , although the phenix detector has only @xmath90 coverage in azimuth , the pair acceptance actually is sensitive to the full range in @xmath9 , @xmath91 ; similarly the pair coverage in @xmath10 is also doubled relative to single particle @xmath8 acceptance , @xmath92 .",
    "the pair phase space is @xmath93 , four times that for single particle acceptance , @xmath94 .",
    "however , this increase is compensated by the decrease in overall pair efficiency , which is only 25% .",
    "there is only one point ( @xmath95 ) where @xmath96 ( the probability of detecting the associated particle when the trigger particle is detected is 1 ) .    rl    &    l     +    the foreground distribution is modulated by the same pair acceptance function : @xmath97 by dividing the foreground by the mix distribution , the @xmath98 cancels out , and we are left with a constant background plus the jet signal .",
    "this ratio has correct jet shape , but the magnitude is off by factor of @xmath99 .",
    "let s assume the original number of trigger ( @xmath89 ) and associated particles ( within @xmath100 ) per event are @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and those within phenix acceptance per event are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively . then the sum rule for original and acceptance filtered mix event pair distribution are , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the total number of triggers . from eq.[eq",
    ": acc2]-[eq : acc3b ] , we obtain the following relation between the original(true ) jet @xmath67 and the measured @xmath67 : @xmath107 @xmath108 represents the single particle correction to @xmath109 in @xmath7 and 1 unit in @xmath8 .",
    "building two dimensional correlation requires high statistics for event mixing . instead",
    ", correlation function is often built as function of @xmath9 only , by integrating the 2d correlation function over @xmath10 .",
    "the following relations are true , @xmath110    to relate the measured @xmath9 distribution ( eq.[eq : cy1d2 ] ) with the true @xmath9 distribution ( eq.[eq : cy1d1 ] ) , we require the following two assumptions :    * the jet signal can be factorized in @xmath10 and @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath111 + typically , the jet signal can be approximated by , @xmath112 in pp or pa collisions , near side jet widths in @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the same , @xmath113 .",
    "on the away side the jet distribution in @xmath10 ( @xmath114 ) is typically very wide due to the difference in momentum fraction,@xmath33 , of the two initial partons . *",
    "the pair acceptance function can be factorized in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , i.e @xmath115 .",
    "this condition is satisfied if the single particle efficiency factorize in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    with these two assumptions , using eq.[eq : acc4a ]",
    ", we can derive following relation that connects eq.[eq : cy1d1 ] and eq.[eq : cy1d2 ] . @xmath116 comparing with eq.[eq : acc4b ] , we sees that eq.[eq : cy1d5 ] have two more terms that are related to the @xmath10 correction .",
    "the first term is the pair acceptance weighted average of jet signal over @xmath117 .",
    "the second term ( @xmath118 ) corresponds to the fact that only a certain fraction of jet signal falls in the @xmath117 .",
    "eq.[eq : acc4a ] and eq.[eq : cy1d4 ] are equivalent : both correct the jet yield to the true yield in @xmath117 , i.e @xmath100 . to account for the loss of jet yield outside @xmath117 ,",
    "an additional extrapolation factor is needed . because the jet shape in @xmath10 are quite different for the same side and away side , we use two different approaches .",
    "for the same side we assume the jet width are equal for @xmath10 and @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath119  @xcite , and simply extrapolate @xmath120 ( guassian ) to the full jet yield . on the away side , since the jet width in @xmath10 is much broader than the typical phenix pair acceptance , we assume @xmath120 is constant in @xmath117 and no additional extrapolation is required . under such approach , eq.[eq :",
    "cy1d5 ] becomes ,    @xmath121    since @xmath122 typically has a triangular shape , this correction is easy to evaluate .",
    "the extraction procedures for jet width and @xmath67 are verified with pythia event generator  @xcite , using @xmath55 correlation .",
    "a single particle acceptance filter is imposed to randomly accept charged particles according to the detector efficiency .",
    "fig.[fig : cycheck1 ] shows the phenix style two dimensional single particle acceptance filter used in the simulation .",
    "the average efficiency in @xmath109 in azimuth and 1 unit of pseudo - rapidity is @xmath123 .",
    "cc    &    we generated 1 million pythia events , each required to have at least one @xmath124 gev / c charged pions . to speed up the event generation , a cut of @xmath125 on the underlying parton - parton scattering is required .",
    "these events were filtered through the single acceptance filter . as an approximation",
    ", we ignore the @xmath2 dependence of acceptance . the same event and mixed pair @xmath9 distributions",
    "were then built by combining the accepted @xmath126 and charged hadrons , where the trigger @xmath126 is selected to be @xmath127 gev / c .",
    "the jet width and raw yield were extracted by fitting the @xmath128 with a constant plus double gaussian function .",
    "the raw yields were then corrected via eq.[eq : cy1d6 ] to full jet yield for same side and to true yield in @xmath100 for away side .",
    "meanwhile , we also extract the true @xmath67 and jet width without the acceptance requirement .",

    "the yields agree within 10% and the widths agree within 5% .",
    "since @xmath129 , @xmath130 are derived from the jet width(eq.[eq : jt1]-[eq : kt2 ] ) , the agreement in width naturally leads to the agreement in the @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "one can notice that there are some systematic difference in the comparison of the yield at low @xmath18 .",
    "this might indicate that the gaussian assumption is not good enough when the jet width is wide and the extrapolation for @xmath131 become sizeable ( at @xmath132 gev / c , the jet width @xmath133(rad ) , and the extrapolation is about 20% . ) .",
    "the formulae on @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath67 are discussed in two particle correlation framework . a more general definition of @xmath43 is found to be consistent with previous approximation , but the @xmath44 is lower by up to 10% .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the event mixing technique can reproduce the jet width ( thus the @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) for a limited acceptance detector . with a correction factor that takes into account the limited @xmath10 acceptance",
    ", we can also reproduce the @xmath67 .",
    "based on a pythia simulation in phenix acceptance , our procedure can reproduce the @xmath67 within 10% and the jet width within 5% at both the same side and away side .",
