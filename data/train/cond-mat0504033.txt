    "as it is well known , this method finds a way round the detailed consideration of many degrees of freedom by representing via a noise source the effect of collisions with molecules in the fluid in which the particle moves .",
    "the approach to thermal equilibrium is produced by random forces , and these are sufficient to determine dynamical correlations , diffusion , and a basic form for the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .    in the same spirit , attractors of nonlinear low - dimensional maps under the effect of external noise can be used to model states in systems with many degrees of freedom . in a one - dimensional map with only one control parameter @xmath0 the consideration of external noise",
    "could be thought to represent the effect of many other systems coupled to it , like in the so - called coupled map lattices @xcite .",

    "an interesting option offered by eq .",
    "( [ mapnoise1 ] ) is the study of singular states known to exhibit anomalous dynamics .",
    "for instance , the so - called onset of chaos in logistic maps is a critical attractor with nonergodic and nonmixing phase - space properties , and the perturbation of this attractor with noise transforms its trajectories into genuinely chaotic ones with regular ergodic and mixing properties .",
    "a case in point here would be to obtain the atypical dynamics near an ergodic to nonergodic transition and compare it , for example , to that in supercooled liquids close to glass formation , where also an ergodic to nonergodic transition is believed to occur .",
    "the dynamical properties for such glassy states appear associated to two - time correlations with loss of time translation invariance ( tti ) and aging scaling properties , as well as to subdiffusion and arrest @xcite .",
    "the specific question we would like to address is whether there are properties shared , and if so , to what extent , by critical attractors in nonlinear low - dimensional maps and nonergodic states in systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "recently @xcite , it has been realized that the dynamics at the noise - perturbed edge of chaos in logistic maps shows similarities with that observed in supercooled liquids close to vitrification .",
    "three major features of glassy dynamics in structural glass formers , two - step relaxation , aging , and a relationship between relaxation time and configurational entropy , were shown to be displayed by the properties of orbits with vanishing lyapunov coefficient .",
    "interestingly , the previously known properties in control - parameter space of the noise - induced bifurcation gap ( see fig . [ fig_att_lpn ] ) @xcite play a central role in determining the characteristics of dynamical relaxation at the chaos threshold , and this was exploited to uncover the analogy between the dynamical and the thermal systems in which the noise amplitude @xmath6 plays a role equivalent to a temperature difference @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the so - called glass transition temperature @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite only the properties of single - time functions ( i.e. trajectories ) were discussed and here we focus the analysis on two - time correlations .",
    "this would allow for a closer examination of the analogy with glassy dynamics as the study of the latter often centers on two - time correlations .",
    "however , we also look at diffusion properties via the determination of the mean square displacement of trajectories in a suitably space - extended map . to lay emphasis on the similarities in the dynamics between the two types of systems",
    "we analyze the attainment of tti in the correlations caused by the action of noise .",
    "we recall @xcite that exposure of attractors to noise have the features of an activated process a mechanism that is usually considered in the interpretation of relaxation processes in glass formers .",
    "also we make up a simple landscape picture for the properties of the noise - perturbed map in order to compare it with that obtained from the multidimensional energy landscape of supercooled liquids .",
    "aware of our crude attempt to contrast the dynamics of a single map ( although equivalent to a coupled array of such maps when described via a langevin - type equation ) with that of thermal systems we point out the main differences encountered .",
    "specifically , the dynamics at the onset of chaos displays regular patterns absent in the known ( experimental or computed ) dynamics of molecular systems .",
    "these differences reflect the peculiarities of the period - doubling route to chaos displayed by unimodal maps .",
    "the structure of the body of the article is as follows : in section 2 we recall essential properties of the logistic map under additive noise , e.g. the bifurcation gap and its time - dependent manifestation at the chaos threshold . in section 3 we present results on ensemble - averaged two - time correlations for @xmath9 , the attainment of tti , and the development of two - step relaxation as @xmath10 . in section 4",
    "we focus on time - averaged two - time correlations and the occurrence of the characteristic aging scaling at the onset of chaos with @xmath11 . in section 5",
    "we present a repeated - cell map for diffusion at the onset of chaos and show the evolution in behavior from diffusive to subdiffusive and finally to localization as @xmath10 . in section 6",
