    "located at a distance of 2.3 kpc , one of the most massive stars in our galaxy ever discovered , @xmath0 car is a well - known example of the evolved and unstable luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars , characterized by sporadic , violent mass - loss eruptive events ( e.g. , humphreys @xmath1 davidson 1994 ) .",
    "the 19th century spectrograms of @xmath0 car ( see also walborn @xmath1 liller 1977 ; humphreys , davidson @xmath1 smith 1999 and references therein ) provide evidence that the star underwent a giant eruption during @xmath220 yr around the 1840s , where a few solar masses of gas ( @xmath310 m@xmath4 ) were expelled into the interstellar medium , and the total luminous output of @xmath210@xmath5-@xmath210@xmath6 erg was comparable to a supernova explosion ( smith et al .",
    "it is still not understood how and why this outburst occurred , but it may be connected with @xmath0 car being a binary star system ( e.g. , damineli 1996 ; damineli , conti , @xmath1 lopes 1997 ) . from this event ,",
    "a symmetric , bipolar nebula known as the  homunculus \" ( that extends from -8 to + 8 arcsec along its major axis ) was produced ( humphreys @xmath1 davidson 1994 ; currie et al .",
    "1996 ; davidson @xmath1 humphreys 1997 ; smith @xmath1 gehrz 1998 ) . during the 1890s",
    ", the historical light curve of @xmath0 car also shows a much fainter eruptive event of shorter duration ( @xmath210 yr ) , but still an outburst in the sense that the mass loss rate was enhanced compared with the normal underlying wind .",
    "this eruption eruption resulted in the formation of a smaller nebula embedded within the large homunculus ( with an angular size of about @xmath72 arcsec ) called the  little homunculus \" ( lh ) ( ishibashi et al .",
    "2003 ; smith 2005 ) . with a total mass of @xmath20.1 m@xmath4 , the polar caps of",
    "the lh currently move at slower speeds ( @xmath2 250 km s@xmath8 ) than the large homunculus in the polar direction ( @xmath2650 km s@xmath8 ) , but shares the same prolate geometry . the total kinetic energy released in the 1890s event",
    "is @xmath2 10@xmath9 erg ( a factor of @xmath10 smaller than the kinetic energy expelled during the great eruption ) .",
    "apart from both homunculi , observations of @xmath0 car with the hubble space telescope ( e.g. , morse et al .",
    "1998 ) also show the presence of an equatorial skirt ( orthogonal to the axis of the homunculus ) that moves with velocities of 100 - 350 km s@xmath8 ( smith @xmath1 gehrz 1998 ; davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) , although high speed features , with typical velocities of @xmath2750 km s@xmath8 ( smith et al .",
    "2003b ) or even larger ( weis 2005 ) have also been detected .",
    "these equatorial components may have been expelled from both the 1840s and the 1890s outbursts ( e.g. , davidson @xmath1 humphreys 1997 ) .",
    "the large homunculus is the central portion of a larger nebula ( the outer ejecta ) around @xmath0 car that extends up to a diameter of 60 arcsec ( e.g. , weis 2001 , 2005 ; walborn 1976 ; walborn et al .",
    "the outer ejecta are not symmetric and contain numerous filaments and knots that may have been produced by previous stellar wind mass loss .",
    "the sizes and morphology of such structures in the outer ejecta are manifold .",
    "radial velocities for the knots reach up to 2000 kms@xmath8 ( weis 2001 , weis 2005 ) , but the average expansion velocity of the outer ejecta lies at lower values ( around 750 kms@xmath8 ) , similar to the speeds found in the homunculus . the outer ejecta also follow a bipolar pattern , like the large homunculus , with approximately the same axis of symmetry .    at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the large homunculus is mainly a reflection nebula .",
    "its spectrum shows the presence of dust scattered emission ( e.g. , hillier @xmath1 allen 1992 ) that allows one to see indirectly the shape of the @xmath0 car wind ( see smith et al .",
    "2003b ) and also low - excitation intrinsic emission .",
    "in addition , near - infrared spectra obtained by smith ( 2006 ) confirmed the existence of a double - shell structure at the edges of the polar lobes of the homunculus ( which was previously inferred from thermal dust emission ; see smith et al .",
    "2003a ) . a thin outer shell of intrinsic h@xmath11 emission ( that traces the main scattering layer seen in visual images ) , and a thicker inner skin of [ fe ii ] ( which partially fills the interior of the lobes )",
    ". on the other hand , the outer ejecta are an emission nebula .",
    "smith @xmath1 morse ( 2004 ) present optical spectra of @xmath0 car showing strong oxigen lines in some emission features of the outer ejecta . at high energies ,",
    "chandra has detected x - ray emission from the large - scale nebula around the star ( and also from the central object , probably due to a wind collision region around the massive binary system ; e.g. , corcoran et al . 2001 ; pittard @xmath1 corcoran 2002 ) .",
    "soft x - ray ( 0.1 - 0.8 kev ) observations by seward et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show an extended shell clearly associated with the debris field of the outer ejecta which are compatible with a collision process between a fast wind and cometary knots of slower material .",
    "the @xmath0 car nebula is also a bright radio source consistent with thermal ( free - free ) emission .",
    "observations by retallack ( 1983 ) at 1.415 ghz ( taken with the fleurs synthesis telescope ) show emission from an overall region as large as 40 arcsec ( i.e. , larger than the optical homunculus ) .",
    "gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimated the contribution by shocks to the total radio - continuum emission detected from the @xmath0 car nebula . using observational estimates of the wind parameters of the eruptive event of the 1890s and of the stellar wind",
    "after the end of the eruption , these authors investigated the evolution of the polar caps of the lh formed as a result of the collision between these outflows .",
    "they found that the lh emits continuum radiation which is detectable at radio wavelengths and indeed , has an appreciable contribution to the total flux of the @xmath0 car nebula .",
    "different models have been proposed to explain the shaping and kinematics of the @xmath0 car bipolar nebulae ( see , for instance , soker 2001 ; soker 2004 ; matt @xmath1 balick 2004 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2004a , b ; a. frank et al . 1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that it is produced by the interaction of the winds expelled by the central star at different injection velocities ( e.g. , icke 1988 ; frank , balick @xmath1 davidson 1995 ; dwarkadas @xmath1 balick 1998 ; frank , ryu @xmath1 davidson 1998 ; langer , garca - segura @xmath1 mac low 1999 ; gonzlez et al .",
    "2004a , b ) . adopting a colliding wind scenario , gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) performed two - dimensional numerical simulations of the homunculi nebulae of @xmath0 car . in their models ,",
    "the large homunculus is formed by the interaction of the eruptive outflow of the 1840s with the pre - outburst @xmath0 car wind ( both with different degrees of nonspherical symmetry ) . a second eruption ( assumed to be spherical ) collides with the pre - outburst wind giving rise to the lh .",
    "these authors showed that such a scenario could explain the shape and kinematics of the homunculi , and also the existence of the high - velocity features observed in the equatorial plane .",
    "however , their prescribed conditions to create the lh nebula do not agree with overall results suggest by the observations . during the 1890s event , the @xmath0 car wind slowed down and increased its mass loss rate , returning to its normal quiescent state after the eruption ended .",
    "another observational result ( as mentioned earlier ) is that the homunculus contains much more mass than that that had been previously recognized ( smith et al .",
    "2003a ) . in this work ,",
    "we perform new numerical simulations that incorporate these observational results and investigate the overall evolution of the bipolar outflows of @xmath0 car .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in @xmath12 2 , we describe the model .",
    "the numerical simulations and the discussion of the results are presented in @xmath12 3 , and in @xmath12 4 we draw our conclusions .",
    "in our model , we consider ( see also gonzlez et al",
    ". 2004a , b ) a simplified interacting wind scenario , in which a nonspherical outburst collides with a slow wind also with asymmetric density and velocity distributions .",
    "we suppose that @xmath0 car originated a nonspherical environment ( prior to the major eruption of the 1840s ) from the ejection of a pre - outburst wind into a homogeneous ambient medium . according to observational estimates",
    ", we also assume that both the mass loss rate and the injection velocity were drastically increased during the main eruption of the 1840s , after which the original slow wind resumes .",
    "we also suppose that the wind parameters are suddenly changed during the smaller mass - ejection event of the 1890s , after which the original wind again resumes .",
    "however , observations of @xmath0 car at this epoch ( e.g. whitney 1952 ; walborn @xmath1 liller 1977 ) give evidence that the expansion speed of the stellar wind decreased during this eruption , rather than increasing ( see also le sueur 1870 ) .",
    "such variabilities in the wind parameters of @xmath0 car during the 19th century outbursts must have resulted in the formation of a pair of double - shock wave structures ( called working surfaces ; see raga et al .",
    "1990 ) , that correspond - in our colliding wind scenario - to the large and little homunculi .",
    "then , the large homunculus would be produced by the interaction between an outburst wind ( with a latitude - dependent velocity and density ) and a pre - eruptive slower wind ( also with a nonspherical symmetry ) .",
    "nevertheless , the little homunculus would be formed - unlike previous numerical modeling ( gonzlez et al .",
    "2004a , b ) - from the impact of the post - outburst wind with the outflow expelled during the minor event , that is , when the eruption ended . according to gonzlez et al .",

    "this structure is accelerated , reaching an expansion velocity of @xmath21000 km s@xmath8 and produces fast ejected material that could be related to the observed material confined to the equatorial plane of @xmath0 car .",
    "the gas is concentrated to the equator by the impact of the two shock fronts , and then it flows into an environment of decaying pressure .",
    "why are these equatorial features moving faster and what accelerate them in our simulations are still open issues which we will attend in a forthcoming paper .",
    "this effect has been also addressed in gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) and it is probably connected with a _",
    "nozzle _ problem .",
    "as can be seen in the simulations ( figs . 3 and 6 ) , the equatorial ejection has some resemblance with a supersonic flow through a tube of varying cross - sectional area ( the problem of the _ de laval nozzle _ ) . at supersonic speeds ,",
    "an increase in velocity is expected when the area of the nozzle increases , such as our models show .",
    "soker ( 2008 ) .",
    "these authors claim the presence of jets ( or collimated fast winds ) launched by the by the central star ( or by a companion ) to explain the presence of an expanding disk and then relate its acceleration to compression of the material in the equatorial plane by the two lobes . ]",
    "in this article , we carried out high - resolution two - dimensional gasdynamic simulations of the dramatic outbursts suffered by the star @xmath0 car during the 1800s , the larger of which occurred in the 1840s and resulted in the formation of the large homunculus nebula and the smaller one in the 1890s created the inner little homunculus . during these events ,",
    "the parameters of the @xmath0 car wind may have drastically changed in short periods of time .",
    "in contrast with the great eruption ( where both the mass loss rate and the ejection velocity were suddenly increased ) , during the minor event of the 1890s ( much fainter and of shorter duration than the 1840s event ) the mass loss rate was enhanced , but the wind velocity diminished compared with the normal @xmath0 car wind .    considering a simplified interacting stellar wind scenario , we could explain the shape and the observed expansion speed ( as a function of latitude ) of the large homunculus .",
    "in addition , our numerical models show that the little homunculus is formed at the @xmath127 of the 1890s eruption , when the post - outburst @xmath0 car wind collides with the eruptive outflow",
    ". important differences with regard to our previous models of the @xmath0 car nebula ( gonzlez et al . 2004a , b ) have been obtained . in gonzlez",
    "( 2004a , b ) , we assumed that the impact between the 1890 outburst and the pre - outburst wind was the cause of the development of the little homunculus nebula .",
    "as a matter of fact , although the momentum flux is dominated by the 1890s eruption , the post - outburst wind has an important effect on the kinematics and morphology of the little homunculus as it causes the complete deposit of the material expelled during the eruption into the polar caps . at this time , the powerful stellar wind accelerates the inner homunculus material so that it asymptotically reaches the velocity of the post - outburst wind . due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities generated by the low - density fast wind pushing the high - density slow wind , the polar caps of the inner homunculus quickly develop filamentary structuring ( fig .",
    "5 ) that shows some resemblance with the observed spatial structures in the polar lobes of the little homunculus by smith ( 2005 ) that suggest that it is not perfectly homologous to the larger homunculus nebula .    also , in contrast with the previous models of @xmath0 car ( gonzlez et al . 2004a , b ) , it is noteworthy that in the present numerical modeling the interior cavity between the homunculi is partially filled by material that is expelled during the decades following the end of the 1840s great eruption , rather than being almost empty .",
    "this agrees with the observed double - shell structure observed in the polar lobes by smith ( 2006 ) , consisting of a thin outer h@xmath22 skin ( which contains most of the material of the nebula ) and a thicker [ fe ii ] layer with a more irregular spatial distribution .    as in the previous models ( gonzlez et al .",
    "2004a , b ) , the present results show the formation of an equatorial outflow with both low and high velocity features .",
    "these are probably related to the equatorial skirt of @xmath0 car .",
    "we note however , although it has been predicted that the observed skirt might be associated with the two outbursts ( e.g. davidson et al .",
    "2001 ) , our simulations indicate that only the great eruption contributes to its formation .",
    "a final remark is in order",
    ". one could ask whether one can learn about the progenitor of eta car from the assumed mass loss history or what can cause such sharp changes in the mass loss rate and speed , without affecting the general shape of the homunculi .",
    "as stressed in gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) .",
    "these questions are vey probably connected with eta car being a binary star system and the nature of the interaction between the main and companion stars . in this work , however , we have focussed in the formation and dynamical evolution of the shock structures associated to the large and little homunculi given the parameters ( terminal velocity , mass - loss rate and/or density ) of the different wind phases , without addressing the inner mechanism that first triggered it or its variability at the much smaller scales of the central source of eta car .",
    "the orbit of the secondary star , for instance , has apoastro and periastro distances of @xmath214 au and @xmath23 au , respectively , while in our simulations , the outflows are injected at much greater distances ( 10@xmath80 cm ) .",
    "a detail study univocally connecting both the inner source scales and the outer scales was , therefore , out of the scope of the present study .",
    "nonetheless , there have been some first efforts in this direction ( e.g. , soker 2001 ; falceta - gonalvez @xmath1 abraham 2009 ) that should be further explored in the future .",
