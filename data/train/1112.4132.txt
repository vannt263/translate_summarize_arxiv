    "this equation stands for various models such as a sedimentation model , a supply - chain model , a pedestrian traffic model . for physical reason , in the following",

    "we prove here existence and uniqueness of weak measure solutions to ( [ eq : system ] ) .",

    "these properties are described in corollary [ cor : l1 ] and in proposition [ prop : stabgeneral ] .",
    "the wasserstein distance of order one is rigorously defined in section [ sec : tools ] .    in theorem [ thm : main ] as well as in the other results of this papers ,",
    "it is in fact sufficient to require that @xmath47 is @xmath48 in @xmath49 and @xmath50 in @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , @xmath52 is uniformly bounded by @xmath53 . consequently , denoting @xmath54 the closed ball of center 0 and radius @xmath55 in @xmath56 , it is sufficient to have @xmath57 .",
    "note also that , restricting the definition of @xmath9 and @xmath13 to the time interval @xmath58 $ ] , we obtain a solution defined on the same time interval .",
    "consequently , we can as well ask only @xmath9 and @xmath13 to be @xmath50 in time instead of @xmath48 .",
    "the system ( [ eq : system ] ) stands for a variety of models .",
    "let us present first a macroscopic model of pedestrian traffic . in a macroscopic pedestrian crowd model ,",
    "@xmath10 is the density of the crowd at time @xmath11 and position @xmath59 and @xmath9 is a vector field giving the speed of the pedestrian . according to the choice of @xmath9 , various behaviors can be observed .",
    "several authors already studied pedestrian traffic in two dimensions space ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "some of these models are local in @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) ; other models use not only the local density @xmath61 but the entire distribution of @xmath10 , typically they depend on the convolution product @xmath62 ( see @xcite ) which represents the spatial average of the density . within the framework of ( [ eq : system ] )",
    ", we can study the models presented in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered for @xmath9 the expression @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a scalar function giving the speed of the pedestrians ; @xmath13 is a convolution kernel averaging the density ; and @xmath65 is a bounded vector field giving the direction the pedestrian located in @xmath59 will follow .",
    "this model is more adapted to the case of panic in which pedestrians will not deviate from their trajectory and will adapt their velocity to the averaged density . indeed",
    ", even if the density is maximal on a given trajectory , if the averaged density is not maximal , the pedestrians will push , trying all the same to reach their goal . this behavior can be associated with rush phenomena in which people can even die due to overcompression ( e.g. on jamarat bridge in saudi arabia , see @xcite ) .",
    "a similar model was introduced in piccoli & tosin @xcite , where the authors instead of an isotropic convolution kernel , consider a nonlocal functional taking into account the direction in which the pedestrians are looking .",
    "in @xcite , the authors study the scalar case in the framework of krukov entropy solutions .",
    "they obtained existence and uniqueness of weak entropy solutions under the hypotheses @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "this result was slightly improved in @xcite where , under the same set of hypotheses on @xmath64 , @xmath69 and @xmath13 , the authors consider a system instead of a scalar equation and obtain global in time existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions .",
    "we recover these results with lighter hypotheses . indeed , although we consider weak measure solutions , these in fact are unique and consequently coincide with entropy solutions when the initial condition is in @xmath70 .",
    "another model of crowd dynamics that we recover consists in the coupling of a group of density @xmath61 with an isolated agent located in @xmath71 .",
    "this can modelize for example the interaction between groups of preys of densities @xmath10 and an isolated predator located in @xmath72 .",
    "such a model was introduced in @xcite where the authors obtained existence and uniqueness of weak entropy solutions under very strong hypotheses .",
    "we recover here partially the results concerning the coupling pde / ode of @xcite .",
    "indeed , the measure framework allows us also to introduce particles / individuals through dirac measures .",
    "for instance , let us assume that @xmath73 such that @xmath74 are in fact functions belonging to @xmath75 and that @xmath76 are dirac measures located in @xmath77 .",
    "let us denote @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we also denote with @xmath80 ( resp .",
    "@xmath81 ) the vector fields ( resp .",
    "kernels ) associated to @xmath10 , and with @xmath82 ( resp .",
    "@xmath83 ) the vector fields ( resp .",
    "kernels ) associated to @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath84 . by definition of weak measure solution ( see definition [ def : weaksol ] ) , if @xmath85 , { \\mathbb{r}}^d)$ ] , the dirac measures are satisfying , for any @xmath86 @xmath87 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be rewritten @xmath88 consequently , in this case , the system ( [ eq : system ] ) becomes @xmath89   \\dot p^j(t)=\\phi^j\\left(t , \\,p(t),\\ , \\rho_t{{\\boldsymbol { * } } } \\eta_t^j ( p^j(t ) ) \\right)\\ , , & j \\in \\{1,\\ldots , k_1\\}\\,.\\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] so we are coupling ode with conservation laws .",
    "system ( [ eq : system ] ) can also stands for models of aggregation , studied in @xcite under weaker hypotheses admitting singular kernels .",
    "the system ( [ eq : system ] ) comprised also a model of particles sedimentation @xmath90 which has been introduced @xcite and studied in @xcite , where the author proved existence and uniquness of weak solutions with initial condition in @xmath48 .",
    "finally , a similar nonlocal model is the one the supply - chain model @xcite , in which we consider the nonlocal term @xmath91 instead of a convolution product .",
    "this last model was studied for example in @xcite with furthermore boundary conditions in @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is divided into two main steps .",
    "first , we prove some a priori properties of the solutions ( see section [ sec : solution ] ) : mainly , we prove that the weak measure solutions of ( [ eq : system ] ) coincide with the lagrangian solutions of this system .",
    "important consequences are the conservation of the regularity of the initial condition and the strong continuity in time in the case the solution is a function , as stated in remark [ rk : propsol ] .",
    "second , we prove the existence and uniqueness of lagrangian solutions thanks to a fixed point argument ( see section [ sec : proofmaintheorem ] ) . indeed , introducing the set of probability measures endowed with the wasserstein distance of order one , we are able to prove a stability estimate with respect to the nonlocal term ( see section [ sec : stability ] ) .",
    "the technique used there is quite similar to the one of loeper @xcite , who studied the vlasov - poisson equation and the euler equation in vorticity formulation .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : solution ] we define the two different notions of solution and prove that they coincide . in section",
    "[ sec : tools ] we give some useful tools on optimal tranport ; in section [ sec : stability ] we prove an important lemma giving a stability estimate and in section [ sec : proofmaintheorem ] , we give the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
