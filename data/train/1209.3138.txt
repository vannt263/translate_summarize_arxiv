    "in order to describe deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) , @xmath1 , one normally considers the exchange of only one photon between the leptonic and the hadronic part of the process . in this one - photon exchange approximation",
    ", the cross section for dis can be expressed in terms of four structure functions : two for unpolarized scattering and two for double - polarized scattering where both beam and target are polarized . on the other hand , because of parity and time reversal invariance , single - spin observables are forbidden in the one - photon exchange approximation  @xcite .",
    "however , this restriction does not apply if a multiphoton exchange is taken into account . in this case",
    "there can be a nonzero single - spin effect due to a correlation of the type @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita tensor .",
    "the four - vector @xmath4 may represent the spin - vector of the nucleon , the incoming lepton , or the outgoing lepton . the correlation in eq .",
    "( [ e : ssa_corr ] ) is nonzero provided that @xmath4 has a component which is normal to the reaction plane .",
    "therefore , one can have a transverse single - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) defined through @xmath5 where the numerator is given by the difference of the cross sections when the nucleon s ( transverse ) spin vector is flipped .",
    "( note that the corresponding transverse ssa in the case of , e.g. , @xmath6 is often denoted by @xmath7 . ) a precise definition of our sign conventions for @xmath8 is given below .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath8 can be expected to be small for it is proportional to the electromagnetic fine structure constant @xmath9 .    while for elastic lepton - nucleon scattering multiphoton exchange has already been extensively studied",
    " see  @xcite and references therein , our knowledge about multiphoton exchange in dis is still rather limited , in particular when it comes to the spin asymmetry @xmath8 .",
    "early measurements of @xmath10 ( asymmetry for a polarized proton ) were performed at the cambridge electron accelerator  @xcite and at the stanford linear accelerator  @xcite .",
    "these experiments were carried out in the resonance region , and in either case the asymmetry was found to be zero within the error bars .",
    "the recent measurement of @xmath10 by the hermes collaboration  @xcite constitutes the first such study in the dis region .",
    "both an electron and a positron beam were used , and again no evidence for a nonzero effect was found  @xcite . moreover , by using a polarized @xmath11he target , preliminary data on @xmath12 ( asymmetry for a polarized neutron ) were obtained in the e07 - 013 experiment in hall a at jefferson lab  @xcite , providing for the first time a nonvanishing transverse ssa in dis on the ( few ) percent level .",
    "the challenging task is to describe both the magnitude and the sign of the proton and neutron data .",
    "on the theoretical side there exists an early phenomenological calculation of @xmath10 which concentrates on the nucleon - pion final state , in a kinematical region where the reaction is dominated by the excitation and the decay of the @xmath13 resonance  @xcite . more recently an attempt was made to describe transverse ssas in inclusive dis in the parton model  @xcite .",
    "that work considered the coupling of the exchanged photons to the _ same _ quark inside the nucleon . while a compact and well - behaved result for the beam spin asymmetry was obtained , the transverse target ssa turned out to be infrared ( ir ) divergent  @xcite .",
    "we review these results below in sec .",
    "[ s : same ] and explain how the ir divergence can be removed . if one keeps quark mass effects , the target ssa also receives a contribution involving the transversity distribution of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "an estimate of this effect gave rise to quite small results for both @xmath10 and @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "we also point out that in ref .",
    "@xcite the influence of two - photon exchange on observables in semi - inclusive dis has been explored for the first time .    in the present work we mainly focus on the situation",
    "when the exchanged photons couple to _ different _ quarks inside the nucleon .",
    "as we are going to argue below , numerically this contribution presumably dominates over the one where the photons couple to the same quark .",
    "the required collinear twist-3 calculation is very similar to the treatment of transverse ssas in hadron - hadron scattering  @xcite .",
    "the analytical result for the target asymmetry depends on a quark - photon - quark correlator ( @xmath14-correlator ) . by using a valence quark picture of the nucleon",
    ", we relate this object to the so - called efremov - teryaev - qiu - sterman ( etqs ) quark - gluon - quark correlator ( @xmath15-correlator ) @xmath0",

    "we then compute @xmath10 and @xmath12 . depending on the input for @xmath0 this approach",

    "the essential element of the calculation is the imaginary part of the lepton - quark box diagram which , in principle , was already computed in 1960  @xcite .",

    "it is instructive to look at the individual flavor contributions to @xmath10 which are shown for the sivers and kp inputs in fig.@xmath24[f : pro_flavor ] . in the sivers case",
    "these individual contributions are quite small and , moreover , they almost exactly cancel each other .",
    "this explains the tiny effect we find for @xmath10 .",
    "( note that other available extractions of the sivers functions from data on semi - inclusive dis  @xcite lead to a similarly small effect for @xmath10 . ) for the kp input there is also a partial cancellation among the flavor contributions at lower values of @xmath67 , whereas at larger @xmath67 , because of the node in @xmath67 in @xmath99 , up quark and down quark contributions give rise to the same sign .    .",

    "while the plot on the left panel of that figure is for the kinematics of the e07 - 013 experiment in hall a at jefferson lab  @xcite , the one on the right panel shows results for typical jefferson lab kinematics at fixed values of @xmath77 covering a larger @xmath67 range .",
    "we refrain from including in the plot the data given in ref .",

    "this means , in particular , that we have a framework which can simultaneously describe both the vanishing / tiny result for @xmath10 as well as the nonzero result for @xmath12 .",

    "such a node was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite as a potential resolution of the sign mismatch problem .",
    "however , as a result of a more detailed phenomenological work , it was already pointed out in ref .  @xcite that a node of the sivers function in @xmath94 can hardly solve the sign mismatch issue .",

    "this suggests that the ssas seen in processes like @xmath6 are not mainly caused by the sivers mechanism as described in twist-3 collinear factorization .",
    "therefore , the sign mismatch problem boils down to the question about the origin of the ssas in those reactions .",
    "one popular alternative mechanism considered in the literature is the collins effect  @xcite ( or its collinear twist-3 analog ) , which describes a transverse ssa in parton fragmentation .",
    "for instance , in a recent study carried out in a generalized ( transverse momentum dependent ) parton model it was argued that the collins effect can contribute significantly but is not sufficient to entirely describe the observed effects  @xcite .",
    "this is an important result even though the existing papers on this topic  see  @xcite and references therein  do not allow one to draw an ultimate conclusion about the role of the fragmentation - related contribution to ssas in hadronic collisions .",
    "other mechanisms have been proposed as well  @xcite , and more work is required in order to settle this important question .",
    "let us also remark that at least a qualitative simultaneous description of ssas in semi - inclusive dis and in hadronic collisions can be achieved if one merely assumes the existence of a sivers function without relating @xmath88 to the rescattering of active partons with beam remnants  @xcite . in such a scenario , in particular , one does not face a sign mismatch problem between the different processes . however , if the rescattering picture , which also underlies the current definition of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions in qcd  @xcite , is taken seriously , then the sign mismatch problem can not be circumvented  @xcite .",
    "the fact that in the present work we can describe ssas in inclusive dis using the sivers function extracted from semi - inclusive dis does support the rescattering picture underlying the sivers effect  see diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ f : twogamma_3parton ] .",
    "obviously , our analysis also supports that the observed so - called @xmath112 modulation of the cross section for semi - inclusive dis can indeed be associated with the sivers function .    finally , we briefly comment on two potential error sources of our numerical results in addition to those caused , e.g. , by the model for the @xmath14 correlator @xmath52 .",
    "first , the three different extractions of @xmath0 that we are using have uncertainties .",
    "however , only for the sivers input is a quantitative error estimate available  @xcite .",
    "since the neutron asymmetry is almost entirely determined by the down quark sivers function for the proton  see plot on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ f : neu_flavor ] as well as eq .",
    "( [ e : relations ] )  the error for @xmath12 in the case of the sivers input corresponds to the error for @xmath100 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the error for @xmath100 , in the @xmath67 range of the jefferson lab data , is roughly of the order @xmath113 with the larger uncertainty towards larger values of @xmath67 .",
    "this suggests that the sivers input leads to a robust prediction of a positive @xmath12 .",
    "second , target mass corrections may play a role , especially for the jefferson lab kinematics . while it is definitely worth trying to obtain an estimate of such corrections , a corresponding study would go beyond the scope of this work , not the least because at present there exists no generally accepted framework for treating target mass corrections in dis  see refs .",
    "@xcite for detailed recent work on this topic .",
    "moreover , since the polarized cross section entering @xmath8 is a twist-3 observable , it is not clear if any of the proposed frameworks in the literature would be directly applicable .",
    "target mass corrections might also cancel to a large extent in the spin asymmetry .",
    "in summary , we have investigated transverse ssas in inclusive dis off the nucleon with a focus on the target ssa , which recently has been measured for a proton target  @xcite and a neutron target  @xcite .",
    "such observables can exist only if more than one photon is exchanged between the leptonic and the hadronic part of the process . in the present work we have considered two - photon exchange where the two photons couple to _ different _ quarks inside the nucleon , and we have given arguments why this mechanism presumably dominates over two photons coupling to the _ same _ quark considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our calculation has been carried out in the collinear twist-3 approach and contains a quark - photon - quark correlator ( denoted by @xmath52 ) of the nucleon .",
    "we have shown that in a valence quark picture of the nucleon @xmath52 is related to the efremov - teryaev - qiu - sterman quark - gluon - quark correlator @xmath0 .",
    "the function @xmath0 has a model - independent relation to the transverse momentum dependent sivers function @xmath88 and plays a crucial role in the qcd description of ssas for processes like @xmath6 .",
    "the relation between @xmath52 and @xmath0 has allowed us to numerically compute the target ssa in inclusive dis .",
    "we have found a reasonable description of both the proton data and the ( preliminary ) neutron data , provided that we take @xmath0 obtained from a fit of the sivers function to data in semi - inclusive dis  @xcite .",
    "our analysis also indicates that a node of @xmath88 in @xmath67 is not preferred , though it is not ruled out either by the currently available data .",
    "we also argued that a node of the sivers function in the transverse momentum @xmath94 such that @xmath88 ( at low @xmath94 ) and the @xmath94 moment of @xmath88 on the r.h.s .  in eq .",
    "( [ e : etqs_sivers ] ) have opposite signs , would not work  see also ref .",
    "moreover , our study suggests that the nonzero @xmath112 modulation observed in semi - inclusive dis can be attributed to the sivers function and , in particular , supports the understanding that the sivers effect is intimately related to the reinteraction of active partons with target remnants .",
    "if we take @xmath0 based on a direct extraction from ssas in hadronic collisions  @xcite , we obtain the wrong sign for the neutron asymmetry in inclusive dis .",
    "this finding indicates that the sivers effect can not be the only source of the ssas observed in processes like @xmath6 . keeping in mind the large spin effects ( up to @xmath114 ) measured there , it is of crucial importance to eventually settle what causes these asymmetries .",

    "<S> transverse single - spin asymmetries in inclusive deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering can be generated through multiphoton exchange between the leptonic and the hadronic part of the process . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider the two - photon exchange and mainly focus on the transverse target spin asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we investigate the case where two photons couple to different quarks . </S>",
    "<S> such a contribution involves a quark - photon - quark correlator in the nucleon , which has a ( model - dependent ) relation to the efremov - teryaev - qiu - sterman quark - gluon - quark correlator @xmath0 . using different parametrizations for @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> we compute the transverse target spin asymmetries for both a proton and a neutron target and compare the results to recent experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , potential implications for our general understanding of single - spin asymmetries in hard scattering processes are discussed . </S>"
