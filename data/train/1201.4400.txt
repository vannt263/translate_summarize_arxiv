    "gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors viz . , ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite have been online in data - recording mode since 2000 .",
    "ligo has concluded its sixth science run ( s6 ) in 2010 .",
    "data have been archived from not only the gw channels , but also from several hundreds of auxiliary and environmental channels .",
    "there are two main broad categories in which data analysis has been organized : astrophysical searches  @xcite and detector characterization  @xcite .",
    "these two tasks are not entirely independent .",
    "detector characterization research products prepare the ground work for understanding the underlying noise and feed the astrophysical searches with information  @xcite that symbolize which data segments are relevant for gw search .",
    "data from the gw detectors have both broadband and narrowband noise . the narrowband noise ( aka lines )",
    "is extensively studied and several methods  @xcite have been implemented to efficiently remove them from the data . however , reduction of the broadband noise ( aka triggers ) is a difficult problem that has not been explored to the fullest yet .",
    "the sensitivity of the detectors has improved steadily over the years  @xcite . with each step towards a more sensitive instrument ,",
    "many new sources of noise have also been unearthed .",
    "occurence of triggers in the data is a function of the operating conditions .",
    "thus it is important to track down the sources to make the output data as high quality as possible and to reduce probability of false alarms .",
    "a very large effort has been undertaken to analyze the noise transients in the gw channels ( referred to as darm_err channel ) in the ligo detectors @xcite .",
    "these consist of looking at triggers in time frequency planes @xcite , exploring loudest triggers seen in burst pipelines @xcite , studying low frequency seismic disturbances @xcite , looking at specific types of triggers e.g. from photodiodes @xcite and exploring structures present in the trigger population in dimensions higher than the usual three dimensional cartesian system using multidimensional hierarchical classification ( mhc ) methods @xcite .",
    "these methods are complementary and cast light on different aspects of the triggers seen in the data .",
    "gw data are archived in the format of discretely sampled time series from the main gw channel as well as from several hundreds of instrumental and environmental channels that are recorded specifically to monitor functioning of different instrumental subsystems and environmental activities that affect the gw channel data .",
    "the triggers arrive at a high rate in all channels .",
    "this requires data mining methods to keep up with near realtime information and to process the enormous volume of data for information extraction .",
    "classification is the most effective way of addressing this problem .",
    "the methods of classifying large data sets in multidimensional parameter space bring an immediate reduction in the dimensionality of the problem under the assumption that existing classes show some common collective properties . in the context of triggers seen in the gw data",
    ", we would like to explore how many different classes of triggers are present and how to characterize these classes in terms of their origin .",
    "development of a knowledge base in understanding the properties of the triggers thus seen in gw data contributes towards development of realistic noise models that are essential in proper assessment of peformance of astrophysical search pipelines .",
    "there are several analysis pipelines that operate online on ligo data to look for burst - like signals or triggers e.g. kleine welle ( kw )  @xcite , omega ( op )  @xcite and waveburst ( wb )  @xcite .",
    "the kw pipeline works on multiple channels - the gw channel and several hundreds of auxiliary and environmental channels .",
    "the threshold is kept such that the pipeline picks up triggers of all types at a steady rate .",
    "unsupervised data mining methods like the mhc analysis  @xcite has been developed and ligo science data have been analyzed in recent past .",
    "the aim of these studies has been to classify the population of triggers seen in the gw , environmental and auxiliary channels into statistically significant distinct groups with uniform characteristics .",
    "these studies have been mostly based on a handful of discrete properties of the triggers viz .",
    "duration , central frequency and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "however , an important aspect of the triggers , viz . the ` shape ' factor has largely been overlooked",
    ". shape of the triggers , or the waveform , often contains rich informaton .",
    "temporal classification  @xcite methods e.g. s - means and constraint validation  @xcite have been developed in the recent past and studied on simulated gw data .",
    "however , they have not been tested on data from real gw detectors .    another successful and often applied method is based on distances calculated using the longest common subsequence ( lcss )  @xcite .",
    "the technique has been studied in gw data for the first time in a recent publication  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results demonstrated have shown production of trigger clusters with similar shapes .",
    "the current paper explores fast , accurate and efficient methods for unsupervised classification of trigger waveforms further .",
    "an analysis pipeline has been constructed based on lcss and also lcss in conjunction with fast time series evaluation ( ftse )  @xcite .",
    "the latter is done to explore possibilities of increasing computational speed when very large datasets of triggers are involved .",
    "this is the first exploration of combined lcss and ftse methods in the context of gw data analysis . a second stage involving the mhc methods  @xcite",
    "is carried out to check the homogeneity of the clusters in the parameter space of their physical properties .",
    "this results in further segmentation of the triggers to appropriate them to their sources - instrumental or environmental .",
    "some of the specific questions we explore in the paper are ( i ) are lcss and lcss+ftse suitable methods for fast and accurate trigger classification ?",
    "( ii ) how are the resulting classes of triggers characterized ?",
    "( iii ) what are the computational costs involved ? ( iv )",
    "how robust are these methods for gw trigger classification ?",
    "( v ) how can the analysis give relevant information for tracking down sources of non - gw triggers ?",
    "it is shown in this study that application of the lcss ( or lcss+ftse ) followed by mhc is a very useful and productive way to classify triggers based on their waveforms and characteristic physical properties .",
    "as has been found in the study with s6 data , the end result of the pipeline produces trigger classes with similar waveforms and amplitude , central frequency , q - factor and snr range .",
    "each of these classes of triggers is shown to be related to a group of auxiliary and environmental channels indicating the most probable sources of their origin .",
    "this combined classification pipeline performs better than methods based either only on discrete trigger properties or on trigger waveforms alone .",
    "thus it can be turned into an effective , low latency trigger identification tool for gw detector characterization .",
    "this paper is an illustration of the method and its advantages .",
    "results from the sample s6 data chosen over a two day period are used to show how the method could be applied in science runs to extract information complementary to and in conjunction with the existing methods with low latency .",
    "the final outcome of this analysis shows existence of several statistically significant classes of triggers with distinct waveforms and physical properties coming from the gw channel in the test data set from s6 .",
    "post - classification analysis explores the couplings of these trigger classes to different sets of auxiliary and environmental systems .",
    "application of lcss and lcss+ftse ( which yields classes based on waveforms ) alone would give 19 distinct classes , while application of only the mhc analysis would have given 3 statistically significant classes .",
    "thus , the proposed analysis clearly has advantage in using a bigger parameter space leading to a finer classification structure that helps in the identification of triggers by maximum utilization of its information content .",
    "since each of the subgroups contains triggers with very characteristic properties related to a specific set of channels , the method proves useful in the classification of triggers seen in gw data and in helping with tracking down the sources or origins of the triggers . as a direct application to detector characterization",
    ", we can classify the triggers seen in gw science data into different groups with characteristic properties , related to specific instrumental and environmental sources .",
    "we can thus study the trend of various kinds of triggers and gain insight into how some of the channels may be reponsible in production of specific types of triggers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ kw ] describes the trigger generation process and sec .",
    "[ algo ] describes the ftse and lcss algorithms .",
    "we explain the pipeline for generation of trigger clusters in sec .",
    "sec .  [ results ] then presents results from numerical simulations and applications to s6 .",
    "conclusions and directions to future work are presented in sec .",
    "[ future ] .",
    "techniques for detection of burst - like triggers in the gw instrumental output data stream are described concisely in an earlier paper  @xcite . in general ,",
    "such techniques project the data onto a basis that spans the parameter space of the burst - like signals .",
    "a measurement becomes optimal when there is an exact match between a member in the contructed basis and a burst .",
    "the snr @xmath0 in this case is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the total energy content of the signal and @xmath3 is the one - sided power spectral density . in cases where a close match between the signal and the member of the basis is not achieved ,",
    "the bursts are characterized by a quality factor @xmath4 defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the central frequency and @xmath7 is the bandwidth .",
    "the time - frequency plane is thus titled by the @xmath4 values where the signals are represented by localized pixels with the same @xmath4 .",
    "there are two main issues that one must address while developing an efficient feature - based classification method ",
    "( i ) the data may have temporal gaps , i.e. there may be same pattern occurring at different time epochs and ( ii ) the classification preferably should be automatic ( to keep up with the online feedback systems ) and thus unsupervised classification methods that are _ robust to noise _ need to be explored .",
    "let us first take a look at why lcss algorithm is efficient and how it fits into gw data analysis . in any unsupervised classification method , the first step is to calculate the distance between points in the parameter space . even though euclidean distance is the most commonly used method ,",
    "it is not suitable for addressing the first difficulty mentioned above .",
    "thus , two triggers that have the same waveform may show a high euclidean distance if they are not occurring simultaneously .",
    "this will be considered a redundant cluster from the physical point of view .",
    "lcss algorithm is able to compute a match between two time series by calculating metrics for triggers that do not necessarily occur at the same time without having to rearrange the sample sequences to coincide .    as an example , let us consider a _ sequence _ of characters @xmath8 .",
    "a _ subsequence _ is defined as a set of characters that appear in an order from the left to the right , but not necessarily consecutively .",
    "thus , [ @xmath9 , [ @xmath10 , [ @xmath11 , [ @xmath12 are subsequences , but [ @xmath13 is not a subsequence . a _ common subequence _ of two sequences is a subsequence that appears in both sequences .",
    "a _ longest common subequence _ ( lcss ) is a common subsequence of maximal length .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath14 and @xmath15 an lcss ( denoted by lcss@xmath16 ) is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the algorithm operates on the principle of enumeration all subsequences of @xmath18 , followed by checking if they are subsequences of @xmath19 as well .",
    "let us now look at the theory of lcss in the context of the trigger waveforms in the present study .",
    "formally , this amounts to comparing two input trigger time series sequences @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the length of the sequences @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the length of lcss of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( or written as lcss@xmath26 ) will be denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "the recurrence relation  @xcite leading to the length of the lcss for each pair @xmath28 $ ] is given as follows :    @xmath29    if @xmath24 or @xmath25 is empty sequence , i.e. if @xmath30 or @xmath31 ; @xmath32 if @xmath33 ; @xmath34 if @xmath35 , where @xmath36).\\ ] ]    the algorithm is shown graphically in figure [ lcssfig ] . a single @xmath37 value is localized in the sense that it depends only on the three neighboring values .",
    "after the table has been filled , the length of the subsequence is found in @xmath38).\\ ] ] the common subsequence is found by backtracking from @xmath39 by following at each step , the pointers that are set during the calculation of the values .",
    "when a match is found , the lcss is upgraded . in this way",
    ", one can traverse a path through the lcss table ( as shown in [ lcssfig ] ) until a length of zero is reached . in this case , @xmath40 is = 4 and the lcss corresponding to the path shown is * uvuu*.    the algorithm works as follows .",
    "a pair @xmath41 defines a match if @xmath42 the set of all matches is given by @xmath43 each match belongs to a class @xmath44 | [ i , j ] \\in \\eta ; \\alpha(i , j ) = k \\ } , 1 \\le k \\le \\zeta.\\ ] ] a match belonging to the @xmath45 is called a @xmath46-match . in the figure [ lcssfig ] , the marked entries define the class @xmath45 . since each match belongs to only one class , these classes partition all matched of @xmath47 .",
    "some @xmath46-matches are more useful algorithmically ( e.g. square marks in the figure [ lcssfig ] ) than the others ( e.g. circle marks in the figure [ lcssfig ] ) .",
    "this can be proven as follows .",
    "let us consider matches [ @xmath48 and [ @xmath49 of @xmath45 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 or @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "every element of @xmath54 that follow [ @xmath49 should also follow [ @xmath48 in the lcss .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to consider only the dominant matches [ @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath55 be the set of all dominant matches .",
    "the regions in the figure where @xmath56 values are equal ( shown by vertical and horizontal lines ) are called lcss contours .",
    "each @xmath46-match lies immediately below the @xmath57 contour .",
    "these contours are defined by an ordering property .",
    "if @xmath55 = @xmath58 , [ i_2 , j_2 ] , \\dots , [ i_l , j_l , ] $ ] , the matches can be renumbered such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the strategy for locating the dominant matches is based on advancing from contour to contour .",
    "the figure shows graphically how the lcss algorithm works .",
    "the two - dimensional array with the two sequences @xmath24 and @xmath25 is shown along the two axes .",
    "initially the cells in the array have uniform entries of zeros . in the next step ,",
    "we look for an element to element match .",
    "whenever a match is found , the cell entry in incremented by one . the sequence of arrows show a possible lcss path .",
    "the lcss path in this case indicates that there is a match of four elements in the sequence viz .",

    "more details are given in [ algo ] . ]      once the distances are calculated according to equation ( 5 ) , a generalized k - means [ 29 ] algorithm is employed to form the clusters .",
    "the reason as to the choice of k - means is dictated by the fact that this allows formation of homogeneous clusters that are insensitive to outliers .",
    "k - means  @xcite uses two parameters to start with ",
    "the number of clusters @xmath62 and the set of elements @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "the algorithm works as follows .",
    "let @xmath64 $ ] be the set of centroids assigned randomly and the size of the set @xmath65 equals @xmath62 .",
    "each item @xmath66 is placed into the cluster which has the nearest mean .",
    "@xmath65 is populated with a new value of mean for each cluster @xmath67 .",
    "the cluster mean of @xmath68 $ ] is usually ( but not necessarily ) calculated as:@xmath69where @xmath70 is the number of items and @xmath66 is the item placed in each cluster @xmath67.the last three steps are repeated until a defined convergence condition is met such as no further change in the membership of the clusters .",
    "+ one of the short falls of k - means is that the algorithm needs a predefined value of k or the number of clusters , which is exactly what the proposed clustering technique aims to know . in case of unknown data under test",
    ", the number of significant groups in the classification structure is unknown and hence it can not be supplied to k - means .",
    "several validity measures have been developed to determine the value of k in k - means . using the ratio of intra cluster distances @xmath71 to inter cluster distances @xmath72",
    ", a simple validity measure @xmath73 is used to find out the optimum number of clusters  @xcite .",
    "the time series representation of the triggers within a cluster ( a _ point _ in the multivariate parameter space ) must be as similar as possible and similar points belonging to different clusters must be as different as possible ( in the same multivariate parameter space ) to ensure compactness of clusters .",
    "therefore , the intra cluster distance should be minimum and the inter cluster distance should be maximum . since ,    @xmath74    the value of k which makes the validity measure minimum , is the ideal one . in practice",
    "it is expected that the values of k found from the above method would vary slightly on different runs .",
    "this happens because , in the k - means algorithm , the centroids are assigned randomly .",
    "therefore , the validity measure was computed one hundred times on the same sets of data and the most frequent value of k is chosen .",
    "the role of lcss in this clustering scheme is to generate an adjacency matrix containing information about the pairwise distances between trigger time series .",
    "once the matrix is created , it can now be supplied to k - means which treats it as an ordinary input and operate on it based on the algorithm .      if we need to implement the classification algorithm as a near real - time tool for trigger identification , we need to make the process computationally fast and efficient . to address this question , we also investigated methods that could enhance the computational speed of the lcss algorithm .",
    "we thus investigate the fast time series evaluation algorithm ( ftse )  @xcite in an attempt to make lcss faster .",
    "lcss in conjunction with ftse claims to be faster than lcss algorithm alone because unlike lcss calculations , ftse does not use a two dimensional array to compare matches between two time series .",
    "values in one time series are entered into a grid .",
    "then a point in the other time series probes into its respective grid cell ( of the same grid ) to check if points of the first time series reside there .",
    "the construction of the grid ensures that if points are found residing in that grid cell , they must match the probing point within a defined threshold . to put it simply , in lcss computed with ftse",
    ", the comparison between two time series occurs _ only _ between the ` intersecting ' portions and that is the underlying reason why lcss computed with ftse is expected to be faster than lcss - where the comparison occurs throughout the entire length of both time series .",
    "the average cost of calculating lcss is @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the lengths of two sequences being compared .",
    "the average cost of ftse computing lcss is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the number of matches , @xmath80 is the longest intersection between the two sequences and @xmath77 is the length of the probing sequence [ 3 ] .",
    "the process of computing lcss with ftse is elaborately shown in figure [ dyn_ftselcss ] .",

    "according to the figure , matching elements of a series @xmath24 are put into the same cells of the grid .",

    ", the element @xmath81 of @xmath25 is found to match the second grid cell and thus the length of the matching subsequence is augmented by one .",
    "likewise , the other elements are also probed in a similar manner and the total matching length between the sequences are recorded .",

    "the combination of the two methods yield trigger clusters that would not appear by any one of the component algorithms - for example , application of lcss ( which yields classes based on waveforms ) alone would give 19 distinct classes , while application of only the mhc analysis would have given at most 3 statistically significant classes ( being constrained by the dimensional of the parameter space . ) since each of the subgroups contain triggers with very characteristic properties and can be related to a specific set of channels , the method proves useful in classification of triggers seen in gw data and in helping with tracking down the sources or origins of the triggers .",
    "as a direct application to detector characterization , we can classify the triggers seen in gw science data into different groups with characteristic properties , related to specific groups of channels .",
    "we can thus study the pattern trend of various kinds of triggers and gain insight into how some of the channels may be reponsible in production of specific types of triggers .      in the following examples",

    "when compared to the couplings observed in the same class of triggers from the current study , we can see that a lot more information can be obtained from the coupled channels recorded in the current study .",
    "one distinction that can be readily made is that , the existing dq flags being most often a result of human observation , are indicative of a qualitative cause rather than an exhaustive list of all auxiliary and environmental channels that might have caused the gw trigger .",
    "a combination of the existing data quality flags coupled with information from the lcss+mhc trigger classes and their relation to the instrumental and environmental activities can furnish a more detailed and complete characterization of the triggers seen in gw channel .",
    "once all information as outlined above has been obtained , the trigger classes can be characterized in terms of ( i ) the waveform , ( ii ) range of physical properties , ( iii ) auxiliary and environmental channel couplings and ( iv ) dq flags in use .",
    "let us illustrate this using the class # 10 and 14 as our example .",
    "table  [ group_character ] shows the mean values and range of snr , frequency and q - values of the sub - groups found in classes 10 and 14 in our example .",
    "it is clear that the discriminating factor is the frequency .",
    "the reason that the main lcss based class splits into sub - groups is because the high frequency triggers appear as outliers in the four dimensional hierarchical analysis .    following figures  [ class10group1 ] ,  [ class10group2 ] ,  [ class14group1 ] and  [ class14group2 ]",
    ", one can easily read off the auxiliary and environmental channel activities at the times of the occurrence of these triggers .",
    "thus , the triggers in a given class and sub - group can be identified by the the shape of the trigger , the central frequency and the coupled channels and flags .",

    "the percentage use ( @xmath136 ) can thus serve as a pattern metric for each trigger group that comes with a characteristic waveform . in this particular example , it is quite evident that , apart from distinct shapes of the triggers belonging to the two groups , the top auxuliary and environmental channel percentage usages are different .",
    "while bth the classes do show very high percentage use for the channel omc_qpd ( output mode cleaner quadrant monitor photodiode ) , class @xmath140 seems to have triggers caused ( in a statistical sense ) by the pem ( physical environment monitor ) mx and my ( mid - station x and y arms ) seismic ( seis ) activities that are not seen in the class @xmath141 triggers .",
    "seismic activities are recorded in the dq flags  @xcite that are being reported by other monitors .",
    "another difference between the two classes is the presence of tcs ( temperature control system ) triggers in class @xmath142 , indicating that some of these triggers might have their origin in the tcs in the intermediate test masses in the x and y arms ( itmx and itmy ) of the interferometer .",

    "two algorithms have been tested here - ( i ) the lcss and ( ii ) lcss+ftse , with the intent to test the relative computational speed and accuracy of classification .",
    "the different groups of triggers are indicators of certain common properties - in this case , similar types of waveforms - and thus can already reduce the dimensionality of the trigger identification problem by a large factor .",
    "this algoritm is then followed by mhc analysis .",
    "the integration of these two methods in a single analysis pipeline yields statistically significant classes of triggers with different waveform signatures and physical properties .",
    "these characteristics in turn are related to the processes that generate them and thus , classification of waveforms help shed light on very important aspects associated with tracking down trigger sources in the interferometer and its environment .",
    "the current study was performed on simulated triggers in absence of noise and also in presence of various levels of noise to set benchmarks .",
    "the two algorithms differed in computational speed but no appreciable difference in performance in classifying the triggers accurately was noticed .",
    "the lcss and lcss+ftse showed comparable computational speed for small samples ( sample size @xmath143 150 ) .",
    "the combined ftse + lcss became rapidly more expensive with increasing sample size .",
    "the computation of lcss from the intersection list of ftse shown in figure [ dyn_ftselcss ] is carried out in three nested loops  @xcite .",
    "the first loop is used to go to individual cells of the intersection list .",
    "the second is used to check individual values of a cell and the third one ensures the order of the subsequence which contribute to lcss .",
    "the second and third loops could be avoided if their purposes could be taken care of while building the intersection list .",
    "the space complexity of lcss+ftse is very high compared to lcss alone and most of the grid cells of the former are usually unoccupied .",
    "the amount of space could be reduced by increasing the threshold value  @xcite ( reducing the fineness of the grid ) which , unfortunately would compromise the accuracy of lcss . in the future applications of the combined ftse and lcss , the algorithms needs to be efficiently parallelized for treating large sample sizes . in case of triggers without noise ,",
    "as is expected , both pipelines yielded an accurate classification structure , with each type of trigger being classified into the right cluster .    in case of triggers embedded in noise ,",
    "the classification structure started to change from the true number of classes present in the data from snr @xmath14416 .",
    "this happens because , with increasing noise , many of the characteristic trigger waveform features get masked by the mixed noise .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ sim_noise_hist2 ] and explained in detail in section  [ results ] .",
    "this is the reason that a careful trigger extraction pipeline has been employed in classification of the real ligo s6 triggers .",
    "ligo data is noise dominated , and sources of noise from auxiliary and environmental channels are many .",
    "a carefully constructed conditioning algorithm as described in section [ l4 ] ensures that the triggers are extracted with as much accuracy as possible , minimizing the noise content .",
    "this enhances the classification accuracy .",
    "an important observation here is that classes produced based on similar waveforms can be heterogeneous in terms of its physical properties e.g. amplitude , q - value , central frequency and snr of the triggers .",
    "application of the mhc to look for further sub - classes in each of the waveform based classes is a very useful and productive step .",
    "this is the first time such an analysis is performed in the context of gw .",
    "as has been found in the study , the waveform based classes of triggers can be related to a group of auxiliary and environmental channels that are seen to have same type of triggers and the sub - classes can then further split the individual classes to indicate which channels are most likely to be responsible for the production of these triggers . as stated in section [ results ] , since each of the subgroups contain triggers with very characteristic properties and can be related to a specific set of channels , the method proves useful in classification of triggers seen in gravitational wave data and in helping with tracking down the sources or origins of the triggers .",
    "this can be a very effective means of characterizing the triggers and cataloging their properties and sources .",
    "the final outcome of the analysis shows existence of 19 statistically significant classes of triggers ( in the data segments analyzed ) with distinct waveforms and many more sub - classes with characteristic physical properties coming from gw channel , that can be coupled to different sets of auxiliary and environmental systems .",
    "application of lcss ( which yields classes based on waveforms ) alone would give 19 distinct classes , while application of only the mhc analysis would have given at most four statistically significant classes .    over a sufficient length of time ,",
    "enough knowledge base of trigger information can be compiled such that triggers can be identified without delay in a response to near real - time ( low latency ) needs of advanced ligo s  @xcite detector characterization .",

    "<S> broadband noise in gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors , also known as triggers , can often be a deterrant to the efficiency with which astrophysical search pipelines detect sources . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to understand their instrumental or environmental origin so that they could be eliminated or accounted for in the data . since the number of triggers is large , data mining approaches such as clustering and classification are useful tools for this task . </S>",
    "<S> classification of triggers based on a handful of discrete properties has been done in the past . a rich information content is available in the waveform or ` shape ' of the triggers that has had a rather restricted exploration so far . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a new way to classify triggers deriving information from both trigger waveforms as well as their discrete physical properties using a sequential combination of the longest common sub - sequence ( lcss ) and lcss coupled with fast time series evaluation ( ftse ) for waveform classification and the multidimensional hierarchical classification ( mhc ) analysis for the grouping based on physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> a generalized k - means algorithm is used with the lcss ( and lcss+ftse ) for clustering the triggers using a validity measure to determine the correct number of clusters in absence of any prior knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> the results have been demonstrated by simulations and by application to a segment of real ligo data from the sixth science run . </S>"
