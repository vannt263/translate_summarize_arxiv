    "from the brain over the internet to social groups , complex networks are a prominent framework to describe collective behaviors in many areas  @xcite .",
    "many of real - world networks exhibit topological features that can be captured neither by regular connectivity models as lattices , nor by random configurations  @xcite . under this framework ,",
    "recent studies of complex brain networks have attempted to characterize the connectivity patterns observed under functional brain states .",
    "electroencephalography ( eeg ) , magnetoencephalography ( meg ) , or functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) studies have consistently shown that human brain functional networks during different pathological and cognitive neurodynamical states display small world ( sw ) attributes  @xcite .",
    "sw networks are characterized by a small average distance between any two nodes while keeping a relatively highly clustered structure .",
    "thus , sw architecture is an attractive model for brain connectivity because it leads distributed neural assemblies to be integrated into a coherent process with an optimized wiring cost  @xcite .",
    "another property observed in many networks is the existence of a modular organization in the wiring structure .",
    "examples range from rna structures to biological organisms and social groups .",
    "a module is currently defined as a subset of units within a network such that connections between them are denser than connections with the rest of the network .",
    "it is generally acknowledged that modularity increases robustness , flexibility and stability of biological systems  @xcite .",
    "the widespread character of modular architecture in real - world networks suggests that a network s function is strongly ruled by the organization of their structural subgroups .",
    "empirical studies have lead to the hypothesis that specialized neural populations are largely distributed and linked to form a web - like structure  @xcite .",
    "the emergence of any unified brain process relies on the coordination of a scattered mosaic of modules , representing functional units , separable from -but related to- other modules .",
    "characterizing the modular structure of the brain may be crucial to understand its organization during different pathological or cognitive states .",
    "previous studies over the mammalian and human brain networks have successfully used different methods to identify clusters of brain activities .",
    "some classical approaches , such as those based on principal components analysis ( pca ) and independent components analysis ( ica ) , make very strong statistical assumptions ( orthogonality and statistical independence of the retrieved components , respectively ) with no physiological justification  @xcite .",
    "although a number of studies investigating the organization of anatomic and functional brain networks have shown very interesting properties of the macro - scale brain architecture  @xcite , little is known about the network structure at a finer scale ( at a voxel level ) .",
    "current approaches are based on the use of a priori coarse parcellations of the cortex  @xcite ; or on partial networks defined by a seed voxel  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , seed - based descriptions may fail to describe the global behavior of the brain , as they only consider the connectivity of the reference voxel . on the other hand ,",
    "parcellation schemes reduce the analysis to a macro - scale fixed by an _ a priori _ definition of the brain areas .",
    "further , a recent study shows that the topological organization of brain networks is affected by the different parcellation strategies applied @xcite .",
    "here we focus on a completely data - driven framework to study the connectivity of brain networks extracted directly from functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) signals at voxel resolution .",
    "a random walk - based algorithm is used to assess the modular organization of functional networks from healthy subjects in a resting - state condition .",
    "results reveal that functional brain webs present a large - scale modular organization significatively different from that arising from random configurations .",
    "further , the spatial distribution of some modules fits well with previously defined anatomo - functional brain areas , assessing a functional significance to the retrieved modules . based on the patterns of inter- and intra - modular connectivities",
    ", we also study the roles played by different brain sites  @xcite .",
    "results provide a characterization of the functional scaffold that underly the coordination of specialized brain systems during spontaneous brain behavior .",
    "bold fmri data were acquired using a t2 * -weighted imaging sequence during a period of 10 minutes from 7 healthy right - handed subjects .",
    "the study was performed with written consent of the subjects and with the approval of local ethics committees . during the scan ,",
    "all subjects were instructed to rest quietly , but alert , and keep their eyes closed .",
    "500 volumes of gradient echoplanar imaging ( epi ) data depicting bold contrast were acquired . in the acquisition ,",
    "we used the following parameters : number of slices , @xmath0 ( interleaved ) ; slice thickness , @xmath1 mm ; inter - slice gap , @xmath2 mm ; matrix size , @xmath3 ; flip angle , @xmath4 ; repetition time ( tr ) , @xmath5 ms ; echo time , @xmath6 ms ; in - plane resolution , @xmath7 mm@xmath8 .",
    "subsequently , a high resolution structural volume was acquired via a t1weighted sequence ( axial ; matrix @xmath9 ; fov @xmath9 mm@xmath10 ; slice thickness ; @xmath2 mm ; in  plane voxel size , @xmath11 mm@xmath8 ; flip angle 15@xmath12 ; tr , @xmath13 ms , ti , @xmath14 ms ; te , 3.87 ms ) to provide the anatomical reference for the functional scan .",
    "all acquired brain volumes were corrected for motion and differences in slice acquisition times using the spm5 ( http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk ) software package . after correction ,",
    "fmri datasets were coregistered to the anatomical dataset and normalized to the standard template mni , enabling comparisons between subjects . due to computational limitations , normalized and",
    "corrected functional scans were subsampled to a 4x4x4  mm resolution , yielding a total of 20898 voxels ( nodes in the network ) . to eliminate low frequency noise ( e.g.  slow scanner drifts ) and higher frequency artifacts from cardiac and respiratory oscillations ,",
    "time - series were digitally filtered with a finite impulse response ( fir ) filter with zero - phase distortion ( bandwidth @xmath15  hz )  @xcite .",
    "a functional link between two time series @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( normalized to zero mean and unit variance ) was defined by means of the linear cross - correlation coefficient computed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the temporal average . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we only considered here correlations at lag zero . to determine the probability that correlation values are significantly higher than what is expected from independent time series , @xmath20 values ( denoted @xmath21 ) were firstly transformed by the fisher s z transform @xmath22 under the hypothesis of independence",
    ", @xmath23 has a normal distribution with expected value 0 and variance @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the effective number of degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "if time series are formed of independent measurements , @xmath25 simply equals the sample size , @xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless , autocorrelated time series do not meet the assumption of independence required by the standard significance test , yielding a greater type i error  @xcite .",
    "in presence of auto - correlated time series @xmath25 must be corrected by the following approximation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the autocorrelation of signal @xmath29 at lag @xmath30 .",
    "other estimators of @xmath25 , and statistical significance tests for auto - correlated time series can be found in  @xcite . to correct for multiple testing ,",
    "the false discovery rate ( fdr ) method was applied to each matrix of @xmath21 values  @xcite . with this approach ,",
    "the threshold of significance @xmath31 was set such that the expected fraction of false positives is restricted to @xmath32 .    in the construction of the networks ,",
    "a functional connection between two brain sites was assumed as an undirected and unweighted edge ( @xmath33 if @xmath34 ; and zero otherwise ) .",
    "although topological features can also be straightforwardly generalized to weighted networks , we obtained qualitative similar results ( not reported here ) for weighted networks with a functional connectivity strength between nodes given by @xmath35 .    to characterize the topological properties of a network ,",
    "a number of parameters have been described .",
    "here we use three key parameters : mean degree @xmath36 , clustering index @xmath37 and global efficiency @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the degree @xmath39 of node @xmath40 denotes the number of functional links incident with the node and the mean degree is obtained by averaging @xmath39 across all nodes of the network .",
    "the clustering index quantifies the local density of connections in a node s neighborhood . for a node @xmath40",
    ", the clustering coefficient @xmath41 is calculated as the number of links between the node s neighbors divided by all of their possible connections and @xmath37 is defined as the average of @xmath41 taken over all nodes of the network .",
    "the global efficiency @xmath38 provides a measure of the network s capability for information transfer between nodes and is defined as the inverse of the harmonic mean of the shortest path length @xmath42 between each pair of nodes .",
    "figure  [ netdegreecdf ] shows superimposed the degree distributions for the seven studied subjects .",
    "for each network , goodness - of - fit was compared here using maximum likelihood methods and the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic ( ks ) for four possible forms of degree distribution @xmath43 : a power law @xmath44 ; an exponential @xmath45 ; a truncated pareto @xmath46 ; and an exponentially truncated power law @xmath47 .",
    "the bestfitting were obtained for the truncated power law ( @xmath48 compared with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the exponential law , the truncated pareto and the power law distribution , respectively ) .",
    "estimated parameters for the truncated power law are @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    ".parameters for real and randomized networks : @xmath54 , mean degree ; @xmath37 , clustering index ; @xmath38 , global efficiency ; @xmath55 denotes the average of parameter @xmath56 obtained from @xmath57 equivalent randomized networks .",
    "single asterisks indicate that this parameter has a significance level of @xmath58 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to partition the functional networks in modules , we used a random walk - based algorithm  @xcite , because of its ability to manage very large networks , and its good performances in benchmark tests  @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "a random walker on a connected graph tends to remain into densely connected subsets corresponding to modules .",
    "let @xmath59 to be the transition probability from node @xmath40 to node @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes the adjacency matrix and @xmath39 is the degree of the i@xmath62 node .",
    "this defines the transition matrix @xmath63 for a random walk process of length @xmath64 ( denoted here @xmath65 for simplicity ) .",
    "the metric used to quantify the structural similarity between vertices is given by @xmath66 using matrix identities , the distance @xmath67 can be written as @xmath68 ; where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the @xmath71 eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath72 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this relates the random walk algorithm to current methods using spectral properties of the graphs  @xcite .",
    "the current approach , however , needs not to explicitly compute the eigenvectors of the matrix ; a computation that rapidly becomes intractable when the size of the graphs exceeds some thousands of vertices .    to find the modular structure ,",
    "the algorithm starts with a partition in which each node in the network is the sole member of a module .",
    "modules are then merged by an agglomerative approach based on a hierarchical clustering method .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , if two modules @xmath73 and @xmath74 are merged into a new one @xmath75 , the transition matrix is updated as follows : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the number of elements in module @xmath78 .",
    "the algorithm stops when all the nodes are grouped into a single component . at each step",
    "the algorithm evaluates the quality of partition @xmath79 .",
    "the partition that maximizes @xmath79 is considered as the partition that better captures the modular structure of the network . in the calculation of @xmath79 ,",
    "the algorithm excludes small isolated groups of connected vertices without any links to the main network .",
    "however , these isolated modules are considered here as part of the network for the calculation of the topological parameters .    as reported in table  [ tablefornetsmodularity ] , a modular structure",
    "is confirmed by the high values of @xmath79 obtained for the optimal partition of the networks ( a value of @xmath80 is in practice a good indicator of modularity in a network  @xcite ) .",
    "further , values of modularity for all the subjects were statistically significant when compared with randomized wirings ( @xmath81 ) . to assess the stability of the partition structure across subjects we used the rand index @xmath82  @xcite , which is a traditional criterion for comparison of different results provided by classifiers and clustering algorithms , including partitions with different numbers of classes or clusters . for two partitions @xmath72 and @xmath83 the rand index is defined as @xmath84 ; where @xmath85 is number of pairs of data objects belonging to the same class in @xmath72 and to the same class in @xmath83 , @xmath86 is number of pairs of data objects belonging to the same class in @xmath72 and to different classes in @xmath83 , @xmath87 is the number of pairs of data objects belonging to different classes in @xmath72 and to the same class in @xmath83 , and @xmath88 is number of pairs of data objects belonging to different classes in @xmath72 and to different classes in @xmath83 .",
    "thus index @xmath82 yields a normalized value between @xmath89 ( if the two partitions are randomly drawn ) and @xmath2 ( for identical partition structures ) . for our data ,",
    "the values of @xmath82 indicate a moderate stability of the partition structure across all subjects ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "to assess a functionality to the different groups of the modular brain webs , we compared the spatial distribution of the recovered modules with a previously reported anatomical parcellation of the human brain  @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we only consider here communities whose size was larger than 40 voxels ( @xmath91 of the size of the whole network ) , which yields @xmath92 modules .",
    "[ commsdistribandnet ] illustrates the spatial distribution of the modules retrieved from the averaged connectivity matrix computed over all subjects .",
    "results show that the spatial distribution of recovered modules fits well some brain systems .",
    "module 22 for instance , includes @xmath93 of the primary visual areas v1 , while module 5 overlaps half of the ventral visual stream ( brain areas v2 and v4 ) , and visual areas of the v3 region ( cuneus and precuneus ) are included ( @xmath94 ) in the module 4 .",
    "module 20 includes most of the subcortical structures caudate and thalamus nuclei ( covered at @xmath95 and @xmath93 , respectively ) .",
    "the auditory system is included by module 12 that overlaps primary and secondary areas plus associative auditory cortex ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "modules 11 , 16 and 21 cover most ( @xmath97 ) of the somatosensory and motor cortices ; and language related areas are mainly included ( @xmath98 ) in module 10 .    importantly , some modules include distant brain locations that are functionally related , e.g. the language related areas ( modules 10 ) , the auditory system ( module 12 ) , or brain regions involved in high level visual processing tasks ( module 5 ) .",
    "this spatially distributed organization of modules rules out the possibility that modularity _ simply _ emerges as a consequence of vascular processes or local physiological activities independent of neuronal functions @xcite .",
    "modules assignment provides the basis for the classification of nodes according to their patterns of intra- and inter - modules connections , which conveys significant information about the importance of each node within the network  @xcite .    the within - module degree @xmath99-score measures how well connected the node @xmath40 is to other nodes in the module , and is defined as : @xmath100 where @xmath39 is the number of links of node @xmath40 to other nodes in its module @xmath101 , @xmath102 is the average of @xmath103 over all the nodes in @xmath101 , and @xmath104 is the standard deviation of @xmath103 in @xmath101 .",
    "thus node @xmath40 will display a large value of @xmath105 if it has a large number of intra - modular connections relative to other nodes in the same module , i.e. it measures how well connected a node is to other nodes in the module ) .",
    "the extent a node @xmath40 connects to different modules is measured by the participation coefficient @xmath106 defined as : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the number of links of node @xmath40 to nodes in module @xmath109 , and @xmath39 is the degree of node @xmath40 .",
    "the participation coefficient takes values of zero if a node has most of its connections exclusively with other nodes of its module .",
    "in contrast , @xmath110 if their links are distributed among different modules in the network .    the role ( r@xmath111 ) of a node in the network can be assessed by its within - module degree and its participation coefficient , which define how the node is positioned in its own module and with respect to other modules  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ rolesbrainnets ] shows the distribution of the roles obtained from all the analyzed networks over the @xmath112 parameter space .",
    "most of the nodes in the functional brain networks ( @xmath113 ) can be classified as non - hubs ( indicated by the gray area in fig .  [ rolesbrainnets]-(b ) ) , while only a minority of them are module hubs ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "non - hubs nodes were classified as ultra - peripheral ( r1 , @xmath115 ) having all their links within their own modules ; peripherals ( r2 , @xmath116 ) with most links within their modules ; or non hub - connectors ( r3 , @xmath117 ) with half of their links to other modules .",
    "this distribution of roles strongly contrasts with that obtained from random configurations ( results not show ) where most nodes have their links homogeneously distributed among all modules ( r4 and r7 ) .",
    "the anatomical distribution of the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath118 is depicted in figure  [ rolesbraindistrib ] .",
    "interestingly , this representation shows that the wiring structure of the brain has a non - homogeneous organization in terms of the @xmath112 parameters distribution .",
    "examples of the different behaviours that can be observed are : _",
    "i ) _ subcortical structures ( indicated by the orange arrow ) display relatively high values for both @xmath99-score and @xmath118 parameters , indicating a dense inter- and intra - modular connectivity ; _ ii ) _ nodes belonging to brain areas associated to the primary visual system ( pointed by the red arrow ) have a scatter connectivity , yielding low values for both @xmath118 and @xmath99 parameters ; _ iii ) _ precuneus and cyngular gyrus areas ( indicated by the yellow arrow ) have a dense intra - modular connectivity ( high values of @xmath99 ) but few links to other modules ( low values of @xmath118 ) ; _ iv ) _ frontal areas and some visual regions related to associative functions ( cian arrow ) present more connections to other modules , which is reflected in their low values of @xmath99 and relatively high values of @xmath118 .",
    "in conclusion , here we address a fundamental problem in brain networks research : whether the spontaneous brain behavior relies on the coordination ( integration ) of a complex mosaic of functional brain modules ( segregation ) .",
    "by using a random walk - based method we have identified a non - random modular structure of functional brain networks .",
    "in contrast to current approaches  @xcite , our procedure requires neither of signal averaging in predefined brain areas , nor the definition of seed regions , nor subjective thresholds to assess the connectivities . to our knowledge",
    ", this work provides the first evidence of a modular architecture in functional human brain networks at a voxel level .",
    "the modularity analysis of large - scale brain networks unveiled a modular structure in the functional connectivity .",
    "although a one - to - one assignment of anatomical brain regions to each detected module is difficult to define , results reveal a strong correlation between the spatial distribution of the modules and some well - known functional systems of the brain , including some of the frequently reported circuits underlying the functional activity at rest  @xcite .",
    "it is worth to notice that , although the functional brain connectivity is strongly shaped by the underlying anatomical wiring ( e.g. by the white matter pathways ) , future studied are needed to clearly examine the interplay between the structural substrate and the modular connectivity inferred from brain dynamics  @xcite .",
    "our findings are in full agreement with previous studies about the structure of human brain networks .",
    "first , we have confirmed the degree distribution presents a power - law behavior over a wide range of scales , implying that there are a small number of regions with a large number of connections .",
    "we also found that brain connectivity shows a degree of clustering that is one order of magnitude higher than that of the equivalent random networks while keeping similar efficiency values , suggesting that spontaneous brain behavior involves an optimized ( in a sw sense ) functional integration of distant brain regions  @xcite .",
    "further , the intrinsic non - random modular structure suggested by the high values of the clustering index of brain networks was confirmed by a high degree of modularity obtained for the ensemble of subjects .",
    "although the mechanisms by which modularity emerges in complex networks are not well understood , it is widely believed that the modular structure of complex networks plays a critical role in their functionality  @xcite .",
    "functional brain modules can be related to a local -segregate- information processing while inter - modular connections allows the integration of distant anatomo / functional brain regions  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sw and scale - free characteristics of brain webs provide an optimal organization for the stability , robustnes , and transfer of information in the brain  @xcite .",
    "the modular structure constitutes therefore an attractive model for the brain organization as it supports the coexistence of a functional segregation of distant specialized areas and their integration during spontaneous brain activity  @xcite .",
    "although the study of anatomical brain networks is a current subject of research , we suggest that a modular description might provide new insights into the understanding of human brain connectivity during pathological or cognitive states ."
