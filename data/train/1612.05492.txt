    "there are several puzzles in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , which may be solved by new physics models based on ( spontaneously broken ) symmetries .",
    "although one may be able to introduce a new symmetry to solve each puzzle , it is desirable to have a unified picture of those symmetries from the point of view of simplicity and minimality , as we suggest in this paper .",
    "one of the mysteries of the sm is the hierarchical flavor structure of the yukawa couplings .",
    "the froggatt - nielsen mechanism is an attractive possibility to explain the quark / lepton mass hierarchy and their mixing matrices  @xcite .",
    "it introduces a new complex scalar field called flavon , whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) generates the sm yukawa couplings . in this model a global abelian flavor symmetry",
    "u(1)@xmath3 is imposed .",
    "another puzzle in the sm is the strong cp problem in the quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite utilizes a global u(1 ) symmetry , u(1)@xmath4 , to solve it ; the pseudo nambu - goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of u(1)@xmath4 , called axion @xcite , dynamically cancels the strong cp angle .",
    "moreover , the pq model explains the present dark matter ( dm ) abundance through the coherent oscillation of the axion field  @xcite if the breaking scale of u(1)@xmath4 is at a relevant scale .",
    "it is also remarkable that the right - handed neutrinos can have large masses through the u(1)@xmath4 breaking  @xcite .",
    "thus tiny left - handed neutrino masses are naturally explained through the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new minimal extension of the sm in which the flavor u(1)@xmath3 and the u(1)@xmath4 are unified .",
    "we introduce only one additional complex scalar field , flavon , charged under the global u(1)@xmath3 whose vev naturally explains the yukawa structure .",
    "as long as this u(1)@xmath3 is exact up to the qcd anomaly , its angular component remains nearly massless , which we call _ flaxion_. assuming that u(1)@xmath3 is anomalous under su(3)@xmath5 , the flaxion gets the potential after the qcd phase transition as ordinary axion and solves the strong cp problem .",
    "similar possibility was already pointed out long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite followed by several studies  @xcite .",
    "we use the minimality as our guiding principle and add only one complex scalar field to the sm .",
    "then , with such an additional complex scalar field ( as well as right - handed neutrinos ) , we show that it is possible to explain the followings : a similar approach was made in ref .",

    "this model possesses a global chiral u(1 ) symmetry , which we denote by u(1)@xmath3 , under which the flavon is assumed to have a charge @xmath26 and the sm higgs is neutral .",

    "expressions for @xmath54 are obtained by replacing @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the interaction between the pseudo - scalar flavon and quarks ( [ aff ] ) yields the effective axion - gluon - gluon interaction through the triangle anomaly diagram .",

    "sec : model ] , @xmath60 . as is well known , after taking the qcd instanton effects into account , the interaction ( [ agg ] ) results in the axion potential to cancel the strong cp angle at the potential minimum",
    "therefore , we can regard the pseudo - scalar flavon @xmath61 as the axion that solves the strong cp problem via the pq mechanism .",
    "we call @xmath61 as the flaxion . except that it has a relatively large domain wall number ,",
    "its cosmological property is the same as the ordinary invisible qcd axion . in particular",
    ", the coherent oscillation of the flaxion can be a good dm candidate .",
    "we will discuss the cosmology of flaxion and the flavon in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmo ] .",
    "the flaxion - photon coupling is also important for low - energy phenomenology .",

    "thus the prospects for the detection of the flaxion dm are similar to the ksvz and dfsz axion models  @xcite .",
    "phenomenological consequences of the flaxion are similar to the dfsz axion , except that the flaxion has fcnc interactions with the quarks and leptons . here",
    "we briefly summarize constraints coming from the flavor - violating process induced by the flaxion and also astrophysical constraints .",
    "the most stringent bound on @xmath68 may come from the process @xmath69 mediated by the second term of ( [ aff ] ) . in order to evaluate the matrix element of such a process",
    ", we adopt @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , which holds in the exact su(3 ) flavor symmetry limit . then , the matrix element is given by @xmath72 , where we have also used the following relation : @xmath73 .",

    "there are also lepton - flavor violating processes mediated by the flaxion .",
    "note that processes including double flaxion vertices such as @xmath80 conversion or @xmath81 are highly suppressed . on the other hand , the decay of muon including the flaxion as a final state might give a stringent bound .",
    "the three body decay @xmath82  @xcite might be the best to constrain the flaxion coupling to the lepton sector .",
    "the constraint reads br@xmath83",
    "@xcite , and the resulting constraint is a slightly weaker than that from @xmath84 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the observation of sn1987a event at kamiokande constrains the flaxion - nucleon coupling , so that the duration of supernova does not change significantly .",
    "the flaxion - nucleon coupling is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 with @xmath87 being the spin content of the nucleon : @xmath88 .",
    "they are given by @xmath89 and @xmath90  @xcite , resulting in @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "the constraint reads  @xcite @xmath94 which is weaker than the constraint from @xmath84 .",
    "it is a striking property of the flaxion , which has flavor - violating couplings , that the most stringent lower bound on the pq scale comes from the flavor physics , not from the sn1987a .",
    "let us also comment on the possible constraint from nucleon decay caused by gauge - invariant baryon- and lepton - number violating higher dimensional operators  @xcite .",
    "if the cutoff scale of these operators are of order @xmath7 , these operators are schematically written as @xmath95 which are multiplied by some powers of @xmath96 to be consistent with u(1)@xmath3 symmetry .",
    "due to the suppression factor of powers of @xmath97 , the effective cutoff scale of these operators can be much higher than @xmath7 . for the charge assignments of ( [ q_charge ] ) and ( [ l_charge ] ) ,",
    "the most dangerous operator is the last one in ( [ p_decay ] ) , which is suppressed only by @xmath98 for the first generation quarks and leptons .",
    "therefore , the effective cutoff scale of this operator is @xmath99 and hence we need @xmath100gev to avoid the too rapid proton decay  @xcite .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the phenomenologically preferred value @xmath101gev , as shown in the next section .",
    "one should also note that this suppression factor crucially depends on the u(1)@xmath3 charge assignments on the quarks and leptons .",
    "as shown in app .  [ sec : ckm ] , we have a freedom of constant shift of all the @xmath102 without affecting @xmath103 and @xmath104 and hence keeping the mass matrix and @xmath105 unchanged . using this freedom ,",
    "it is possible to suppress all of the operators in ( [ p_decay ] ) further .",
    "let us discuss cosmological consequences of the present model  @xcite . as in the case of ordinary qcd axion ,",
    "the flaxion starts to oscillate around the minimum of the potential .",
    "its present density is given by  @xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the initial misalignment angle which takes the value @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the flaxion oscillation can be dark matter for @xmath109gev , assuming @xmath110@xmath111 .    as discussed in the previous section , the decay constant of the flaxion",
    "is related to the parameters in the flavon potential . for @xmath112 and @xmath113 , for example , the flaxion dark matter is realized when @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "since the domain wall number is larger than unity , one may require that the u(1)@xmath3 symmetry be spontaneously broken during inflation to avoid the serious domain wall problem .",
    "in this case there is a stringent constraint on the inflation energy scale so that the flaxion does not acquire too large isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "the recent constraint from the planck result reads @xmath116 with @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the dimensionless power spectrum of the ( uncorrelated ) dm isocurvature and curvature perturbations , respectively  @xcite .",
    "if the flavon field settles down to the potential minimum during inflation , we have @xmath120 where @xmath121 is given by eq .   and @xmath122 .",
    "thus the inflationary scale is bounded as @xmath123 notice that this constraint is based on the assumption that the flavon already settles down to its potential minimum during inflation . however , the dynamics of the flavon field can be non - trivial during and after inflation and it can significantly modify the constraint .",
    "below we see that the flavon itself can play the role of inflaton , avoiding this isocurvature bound .",
    "so far we have assumed that the inflaton sector is independent of the sm + flavon sector .",
    "more interestingly , it may be possible to identify the flavon itself as the inflaton .",
    "first of all , one should note that large field inflation in which @xmath124 rolls down from @xmath125 would be dangerous , since during the reheating stage the flavon passes through the origin @xmath126 many times and it leads to the nonthermal symmetry restoration through the parametric resonant enhancement of the flaxion field  @xcite .",
    "thus the domain wall problem arises after the qcd phase transition in such a case . on the other hand ,",
    "the small - field inflation in which @xmath127 rolls down from near the origin toward the potential minimum may be possible .",
    "although there is no domain wall problem in this case , the flavon self coupling constant needs to be very small and also the flaxion isocurvature perturbation tends to be too large because it is enhanced due to the smallness of @xmath127 during inflation .    here",
    "we propose a nonminimal large - field inflation model which avoids these difficulties .",
    "the idea is to extend the flavon kinetic term to effectively flatten the potential at large field value  @xcite . in an extreme case",
    "in which the kinetic term has a pole at some field value , the effective potential becomes completely flat around the pole after the canonical normalization , and it leads to a class of large field inflation with best - fit value of the scalar spectral index  @xcite .    here",
    ", we adopt the following lagrangian : @xmath128 after the canonical normalization , the flavon potential may be rewritten as @xmath129 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 thus the potential is flat for @xmath131 and inflation can take place there . if @xmath132 , the potential height at large field limit is lower than that at the origin ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pot ] ) , hence the flavon does not pass through the origin after inflation . thus there is no domain wall problem in this case . note that the potential minimum in terms of @xmath133 is @xmath134 as we will discuss in the following , @xmath135 is found to be of the same order of @xmath136 in the parameter region of our interest , and hence @xmath137 .",
    "we also note here that , due to the structure of the kinetic term in the present model , the field @xmath61 is not canonically normalized .",
    "the canonically - normalzed flaxion field around the vacuum is @xmath138 , where @xmath139 thus , the flaxion interactions ( as well as the decay rate ) given in the previous section should take account of the correction factor @xmath140 .",
    "for the case of our interest , however , @xmath141 and hence the discussion given in the previous section is qualitatively unchanged .",
    "we can analyze the slow - roll inflation dynamics as usual  @xcite .",
    "the flavon field value during inflation is calculated as @xmath142 where @xmath143 ",
    "@xmath144 denotes the @xmath145-folding number at which the present horizon scale exits the horizon . the scalar spectral index @xmath146 and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath147 are given by @xmath148 thus the scalar spectral index falls into the planck best - fit region while the tensor - to - scalar ratio is too small to be detected .",
    "the dimensionless power spectrum of the curvature perturbation is given by @xmath149 in order to reproduce the observed magnitude of the curvature perturbation , @xmath150  @xcite , @xmath151 in order for @xmath152 to be in the perturbative range , we must have @xmath153gev , meaning @xmath154gev .",
    "this is consistent with the scale inferred from the flaxion dm density  .",
    "the inflation scale is given by @xmath155      here we show that the isocurvature perturbation of the flaxion is highly suppressed due to the peculiar structure of the kinetic term .",
    "we parametrize the complex flavon field as @xmath156 .",
    "then , the action for the phase @xmath157 is given by @xmath158 since @xmath133 slow - rolls during inflation , we may regard the prefactor in   as a constant . then",
    ", the canonically normalized field during inflation is given by @xmath159 the canonical field @xmath160 acquires long - wavelength fluctuations of @xmath161 during inflation , and hence the original phase @xmath157 fluctuates as @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the power spectrum of @xmath164 .",
    "( here , we have used @xmath131 during inflation . ) since it is related to the fluctuation of the initial misalignment angle as @xmath165 , the ratio of the dm isocurvature perturbation to the curvature perturbation is estimated as @xmath166 which is highly suppressed .",
    "thus , the observational bound is safely satisfied and the flaxion can be the dominant component of dm .",
    "finally let us discuss the reheating after flavon inflation .",
    "there are mainly three decay modes of the flavon : decay into right - handed neutrinos , decay into higgs bosons and decay into flaxions .",
    "other decay modes are suppressed either by the loop factor or the final state fermion masses .",
    "the flavon partial decay rate into the right - handed neutrino pair is given by @xmath167 where the flavon mass around the potential minimum is given by @xmath168 note that @xmath169 is almost independent of the overall scale @xmath135 .",
    "here we have assumed that the flavon is heavier than the right - handed neutrino : @xmath170 .",
    "the partial decay rate of flavon into the higgs bosons depend on the additional potential term can ensure the absolute stability of the higgs potential  @xcite .",
    "note also that there must be a large bare mass term of the higgs to cancel the flavon - induced mass term so that it obtains the electroweak scale vev . ] @xmath171 we find the partial decay rate into the higgs boson pair as @xmath172 where we have taken account of the four real degrees of freedom in the sm higgs doublet .",
    "is too small , the flavon potential can be dominated by the radiatively - induced effective potential . ] on the other hand , the flavon partial decay rate into the flaxion pair is given by @xmath173 thus the total decay width of the flavon is @xmath174 this is typically much larger than @xmath175 and hence the reheating is completed almost instantaneously after inflation . thus the reheating temperature , @xmath176 , can be as high as @xmath177gev in our scenario .",
    "flaxions are thermalized through interactions with higgs and right - handed neutrinos and there is no problem of flaxion dark radiation overproduction .",
    "lastly let us discuss thermal leptogenesis in the present scenario .",

    ", there is no cosmological domain wall problem even if the pq symmetry is restored during inflation , as long as @xmath211gev  @xcite and hence there can be a variety of cosmological scenarios .    although the minimality is lost , it is also easy to embed the theory into the supersymmetry ( susy ) framework .",
    "we can just interpret the lagrangian ( [ 2hdm ] ) as the superpotential written by the chiral superfields .",
    "since there are two higgs doublets in minimal susy sm , we can choose the u(1)@xmath3 charges so that @xmath198 as just shown above .",
