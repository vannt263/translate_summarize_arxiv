    "at the end of the 19th century , when maxwell s theory of electromagnetism had been established , it was known that electromagnetic radiation is produced by oscillating electric charges .",
    "the charges that produce light were however still a mystery .",
    "at the same time , it was generally believed that an electric current was made up of charged particles .",
    "lorentz suggested that atoms might also consist of charged particles , and that the oscillations of these particles inside the atoms might be the source of light .",
    "if this were true , then a magnetic field ought to have an effect on the oscillations and therefore on the wavelength of the light thus produced . in 1896",
    "zeeman , a pupil of lorentz , demonstrated this phenomenon  @xcite , known as the zeeman effect , and in 1902 they were awarded the nobel prize .",
    "lorentz was thus one of the first to predict the existence of the electron , which , within a year later , was discovered by thomson , at least as a free particle .",
    "this , in combination with the results obtained by planck and einstein regarding the nature of black - body radiation and the photo - electric effect , led to the subsequent emergence of bohr s atomic theory .    a full understanding of the zeeman effect can only be obtained from quantum mechanics , but lorentz was nevertheless soon after the initial discovery by zeeman able to produce a simple classical theory which predicted certain aspects of the polarization of the different spectral components .",
    "these were later verified experimentally by zeeman . soon after the discovery of the so - called anomalous zeeman effect ( the weak - field limit ) , around 1905 , came the development of the land vector model of the atom . using this model , with its semi - empirical rules , basically all aspects of the observed zeeman spectra could be explained and predicted  @xcite .",
    "this was however most fortuitous , since the classical land @xmath1-factor happens to be identical to its quantum - mechanical counterpart .",
    "based on the land vector model of angular momentum , in combination with the wave - mechanics of schrdinger , darwin  @xcite was in 1927 able to solve `` the problem of a spinning electrified body moving in a central orbit in a magnetic field [  ] by the method of the wave mechanics in spherical harmonics '' .",
    "the formalism presented there bears very little resemblance to how the problem is formulated nowadays , but the treatment is actually equivalent to an exact solution of the schrdinger equation for the zeeman effect .",
    "it is certainly amusing to read darwin s statement that `` the proper attack on this problem would undoubtedly be by way of the recent work of heisenberg [  ] but this theory is still in the making , so it has not been practicable to apply it here '' ; the article goes on to say that the work of heisenberg `` could give all the results of this paper ; but it would have been harder to follow because the matrix methods are not so easy for most readers as are spherical harmonics . ''    today the situation is rather the opposite , and we shall therefore in this paper present the exact eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the zeeman effect in single - electron ions ( i.e.  hydrogenic systems ) , using the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "these expressions are not new ; they appeared as early as 1933 , due to bethe  @xcite , and they have also been published in the well - known book by bethe and salpeter  @xcite , where several aspects of the fundamental properties of the zeeman effect , as well as certain approximations made in the treatment , are discussed in depth .",
    "however , in neither of the above quoted works is given any indication  or reference  of how to derive these exact formulas .",
    "due to this , perhaps , the presentation of the zeeman effect found in modern text - books on atomic physics ( see e.g.  ref .  @xcite , section 5.2 ) , is limited to the discussion of the weak and strong field limits , known respectively as the anomalous and normal zeeman effect , and perhaps some particular intermediate cases , where the zeeman effect is also known as the paschen ",
    "back effect .",
    "( by strong and weak fields , we mean that the energy contribution from the magnetic field is large or small compared to the spin  orbit interaction . )    for many - electron atoms , this is naturally the proper attack on the problem , since an exact solution is unattainable .",
    "however , for the particular case of hydrogenic atoms and ions , the exact treatment is not much more complicated ; in fact , the resulting expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are quite simple . the spectral properties of single - electron ions have recently received rekindled interest due to a variety of applications within plasma spectroscopy ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in e.g.  fusion research ,",
    "strong magnetic fields are used to control the shape and position of the plasma .",
    "a detailed understanding of the influence of these fields on the spectral lines is crucial for a correct interpretation of the observed line - widths , which are employed for temperature measurements  @xcite , among other things .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field strengths employed often span the entire scale from weak to strong fields , and there is therefore a clear need for a unified treatment of the zeeman effect , valid for all fields .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : exact ] we will show how to solve the schrdinger equation exactly for a hydrogenic system in a magnetic field , under the assumption that the quadratic term in the magnetic field strength can be ignored .",
    "we then show in section  [ sec : strongweak ] how expansions of the exact expressions reproduce the traditional results of weak and strong fields . as a bonus ,",
    "a quantitative expression is found for determining the validity of these approximations .",
    "states with zero angular momentum must be considered separately , and actually correspond to an extreme case of the strong - field approximation , as discussed in section  [ sec : s - states ] .",
    "section  [ sec : htrans ] contains a review of the dipole transition matrix elements and selection rules , and finally we discuss in section  [ sec : approxs ] the approximations made during the derivations .",
    "as pointed out above , the traditional treatment of the zeeman effect in most text - books is limited to the cases where the influence of the magnetic field can be separated from the effects of the spin ",
    "orbit interaction . in the weak - field limit , the magnetic interaction is introduced as a perturbation to the spin ",
    "orbit eigenstates , and vice - versa in the strong - field case . in this picture ,",
    "all perturbations are already diagonal and the formalism is trivial .    in the general case , to be presented here",
    ", these two effects must however be treated simultaneously .",
    "our method will be to diagonalize the combined perturbation in a basis set consisting of the solutions of the field - free , non - relativistic schrdinger equation for a single - electron ion . depending on the orbital quantum number @xmath2 of the states considered",
    ", the matrices will be of various dimensions .",
    "a significant simplification will however emerge from the algebra , and the final energy matrix will separate into a number of @xmath3 sub - matrices which are easily diagonalized .",
    "the case @xmath4 is treated in some detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , from where the idea for the method has been adopted and further developed .      the non - relativistic schrdinger equation for a hydrogenic system in vacuum , ignoring for now the spin  orbit interaction , is @xmath5 \\psi(r ) = h_0\\psi(r ) = e_0\\psi(r),\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the reduced electron mass ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electron and nuclear masses , respectively ) and @xmath9 the nuclear charge .",
    "because of the spherical symmetry , the wavefunction @xmath10 can be written as a product @xmath11 of an angular part , given by the spherical harmonics @xmath12 , and a radial part @xmath13 .",
    "the energy of each eigenstate @xmath14 will depend only on the principal quantum number @xmath15 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "introducing relativistic corrections for the momentum operator adds another term @xmath18\\ ] ] to the energy , breaking the degeneracy in the @xmath2 quantum number .",
    "the degeneracy in the @xmath19 quantum number is only broken through an external field such as the magnetic field about to be studied .",
    "it is not entirely obvious which value of the electron mass to use in eq .  ,",
    "but since the perturbation in itself is a small correction , it will make an insignificant difference whether we use the electron mass @xmath7 or the reduced mass @xmath20  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* footnote on p.  196 ) .",
    "therefore , we shall in what follows always use the standard electron mass in perturbation theory .",
    "the interaction between an atom and an external electromagnetic field is introduced through the vector potential @xmath21 . from maxwell",
    "s equation @xmath22 ( there are , probably , no magnetic monopoles ) , it is clear that one can choose to represent any magnetic field @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "the choice of @xmath21 is not unique , but one can generally write @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is an arbitrary scalar potential . note that over atomic distances , the macroscopic magnetic field can be assumed to be constant in magnitude and direction .",
    "the non - relativistic schrdinger equation ( relativistic corrections and other approximations are discussed in section  [ sec : approxs ] ) for a spin - less electron in an external magnetic field can be derived from the klein ",
    "gordon equation  @xcite , and is @xmath27 \\psi ( { \\mathbf{r } } ) = e\\psi({\\mathbf{r } } ) , \\ ] ] where we also have used the freedom of gauge invariance to set @xmath28 ( the coulomb gauge ) , which means that the scalar field @xmath26 must be a constant , which we arbitrarily may choose as zero .    the term linear in @xmath21 can be written @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angular momentum operator .",
    "similarly , the quadratic term becomes @xmath31 comparing the magnitudes of the linear and quadratic terms , one finds  @xcite that their ratio is of the order @xmath32/tesla for atomic systems . except for extreme cases , such as neutron stars ,",
    "the quadratic term is hence completely negligible , which simplifies the mathematics a great deal .",
    "( when included , the quadratic term will lead to diamagnetism  @xcite . ) for very strong magnetic fields , when the spin  orbit interaction can be neglected altogether but the quadratic term not , the energy levels can be found by different methods  @xcite .",
    "so far we have used a semi - classical picture of the electron by ignoring the spin , which however contributes an additional , intrinsic , angular momentum .",
    "to the magnetic moment of the electron from the classical angular momentum @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the bohr magneton , we should therefore add a contribution from the spin @xmath35 according to the original dirac theory , the magnetic moment of the electron due to its intrinsic spin is determined by @xmath36 .",
    "however , using quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , one finds that the value of the spin gyromagnetic ratio @xmath0 is not exactly integer , but @xmath37 this correction is called the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron . since it poses no problems to retain a general value of @xmath0 in our calculations , we will do so .",
    "moreover , this allows the formalism to be extended ( with proper modifications , accounting for the relative dielectric constant and the electron effective mass ) to e.g.  solids , where the values of the gyromagnetic ratio may differ significantly from 2 , and even be negative  @xcite .",
    "the energy of a magnetic dipole  which the electron effectively becomes due to its magnetic moment  in a magnetic field is @xmath38 and we now also introduce the energy from the spin ",
    "orbit interaction @xmath39 where for the one - electron central - field case @xmath40    in the field - free schrdinger equation , eq .  , the geometry is spherically symmetric , whereas the magnetic field defines a particular direction of symmetry .",
    "we make this direction the @xmath41-axis of our system , which reduces the scalar product in eq .   to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "the total non - relativistic hamiltonian for the electron in a hydrogen - like atom in an external magnetic field thus becomes @xmath44 we assume that the relativistic correction @xmath45 is still given by eq .   in the presence of the external field .",
    "to diagonalize the perturbation @xmath46 we first need to introduce a proper set of basis states .",
    "this is actually not trivial  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 45@xmath47 ) , but to simplify matters we shall use the pauli approximation , in which each state is a two - component spinor and the spin operators are described by the pauli spin matrices .",
    "we can therefore use as basis the eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath48 , arranged in a proper spinor notation . in the unperturbed system ,",
    "the good quantum numbers are , in addition to @xmath15 and @xmath2 , also @xmath49 and @xmath50 , although the eigenstates are degenerate in the @xmath19:s . in the presence of the external field ,",
    "the individual @xmath19:s are no longer good quantum numbers , but only their sum @xmath51 .",
    "we can therefore anticipate that each new eigenstates will be a linear combination of exactly two unperturbed eigenstates , corresponding to @xmath52 and @xmath49 chosen accordingly .",
    "but since the spin  orbit interaction is not diagonal in the unperturbed eigenstates , we need to carry out the derivation using the full expansion in the unperturbed eigenstates @xmath53 where @xmath50 and @xmath49 take on all allowed values . to avoid unnecessary notation ,",
    "the indices @xmath15 and @xmath2 will be suppressed most of the time , as all calculations are performed for fixed values of these quantum numbers . in all matrices below , the basis states are assumed to be arranged in the following order : @xmath54 where up and down arrows mean @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the contribution to the energy due to @xmath55 is @xmath56 & = w \\sum_{\\substack{m_\\ell , m_s \\\\ m'_\\ell , m'_s } } { \\left\\langle n\\ell m\\ , \\vrule \\",

    "we will consider that case separately in section  [ sec : s - states ] , and may assume @xmath62 in what follows .",
    "one can then show  @xcite that for the hydrogenic eigenfunctions , @xmath63 and thus @xmath64    the magnetic field term , @xmath65 is already diagonal in the present basis , but the spin ",
    "orbit interaction @xmath66 is not .",
    "since the orbital angular momentum operator @xmath67 and the spin angular moment operator @xmath68 act on separate vector spaces , spin and position space respectively , they trivially commute .",
    "therefore , we can separate space and spin , so that @xmath69 this expression corresponds to an outer or kronecker product between the space and spin matrices .",

    "as an example , let us consider the states @xmath143 and 4 in heii ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "inserting @xmath4 and 2 for @xmath143 ( for @xmath61 the strong - field approximation is exact ; see the following section ) the threshold field strengths come out as 3.70 and 1.23  tesla respectively .",
    "for @xmath15=4 the corresponding values for @xmath2=1 , 2 and 3 become 1.56 , 0.52 and 0.26  tesla . as briefly mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "a modern application of zeeman effect is to use fusion plasma spectroscopy in order to determine the plasma temperature , by e.g.  studying the transition between precisely these states in heii  @xcite .",
    "typical magnetic fields in a tokamak the size of jet s lie in the range 13  tesla , and we thus clearly see that such an investigation can not be carried out using either of the traditional approximations .",

    "to calculate the zeeman pattern of the spectral line from a transition between two different @xmath149 states , we need to consider the selection rules and the transition matrix elements . since the eigenstates ( [ eq : zeemaneigenstates]b ) of the total hamiltonian , eq",

    "the derivation of the matrix elements for spontaneous emission is a procedure found in any textbook on the theory of atomic spectra ( see e.g.  ref .",

    "we therefore merely state the results in order that this paper can be used as a self - contained reference on how to calculate the zeeman spectrum .",
    "we will then give an illustrative example of the resulting spectrum when these expressions are applied to the zeeman problem at hand .      in the dipole approximation , the transition probability for spontaneous emission from a state @xmath151 to a lower state @xmath152 is found from fermi s golden rule to be @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the solid angle element in which the radiation is observed , and @xmath155 is a unit vector in the polarization direction of the radiation .",

    "this gives the transition rate @xmath196 for a photon with polarization @xmath183 , whereas the rate is zero for polarization @xmath184 .",
    "since the @xmath185-vector is defined as the direction in which the radiation is observed , we find that if the emission is viewed longitudinally ( @xmath185 parallel to the magnetic field ) , @xmath197 and so the @xmath192 component is absent . in the transverse direction @xmath198 , i.e. in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field , we have @xmath199 and thus the @xmath192 component will be plane polarized with @xmath200 in the direction of the negative @xmath41-axis .",
    "* this case corresponds to @xmath201 .",
    "now the only contribution will be from @xmath202 , and since the two polarization directions are orthogonal and independent , we may sum the probabilities instead of the amplitudes . in result , we obtain @xmath203 the @xmath204 component is plane polarized with @xmath205 in transverse observation , whereas in longitudinal observation it is circularly ( left - hand ) polarized .",
    "the intensity of each @xmath206 component is always half of the @xmath192 component in transverse observation .",

    "fig : zeeheii ] for an example .",
    "the number of components increases rapidly with the quantum numbers ; for a @xmath210 transition the total number is 512 , although many will be very weak .",
    "in this section we summarize the approximations made in the treatment .",
    "they are not many , as we have strived to keep things as general and exact as possible . for an even more detailed discussion ,",
    "see ref .",

    "a particular effect which enters if the quadratic term is retained is the possibility of mixing states with different @xmath2 quantum numbers .",
    "the linear term in @xmath21 commutes with @xmath213 , making @xmath2 a good quantum number , but the quadratic term does not .",
    "specifically , it introduces mixing between states with @xmath2-values differing by @xmath214 .",
    "again , this will only be of importance for very strong magnetic fields and can often safely be ignored . *",
    "* relativistic corrections * + using the pauli approximation instead of the dirac theory means we are only calculating the zeeman effect to lowest order in @xmath215 . assuming that all perturbations ( magnetic field and spin  orbit interaction ) are small , we remedy this by using the same correction eq .   as for the field - free case to correct for the non - relativistic momentum operator .",
    "effects beyond this should be negligible .",
    "* * the anomalous magnetic moment * + in the approximate treatment of the anomalous zeeman effect ( weak fields ) it is necessary to use the value @xmath113 .",
    "as it turned out , we were not restricted by this approximation in our exact derivations ( note the factors @xmath216 and @xmath217 appearing in the final expressions , eqs .   and ) , although the influence is very small  unless of course @xmath0 differs significantly from 2 .",
    "* * nuclear motion and hyperfine structure * + we have already taken into account the nuclear motion by using the reduced mass @xmath20 of the electron for the central - field hamiltonian . in the perturbations , we have kept the electron mass since the perturbations themselves are small , so any corrections to them are even smaller  @xcite . + hyperfine structure due to the nuclear magnetic moment is in general orders of magnitude smaller than the fine - structure splitting ( spin  orbit interaction ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that hyperfine structure will not perturb the zeeman spectrum except for extremely weak magnetic fields , where the zeeman pattern can be heavily influenced .",
    "in conclusion , this paper has demonstrated how the problem of a single - electron atom or ion in a static magnetic field can be solved exactly , under the only simplifying approximation that the term which is quadratic in the field strength can be neglected in the hamiltonian .",
    "no assumption was made regarding the value of the electron spin gyromagnetic ratio , which allows the obtained results to be readily generalized to applications in e.g.  solids .    by using the results presented here , a unified treatment of the zeeman effect becomes possible over the entire range of fields presently employed in e.g.  fusion plasma , where the influence of the zeeman effect on the plasma temperature measurements has been demonstrated to be significant in many cases . the well - known formulas for the weak and strong field limits",
    "are easily obtained as expansions of the general results , and in addition it was possible to obtain a quantitative expression for the fields at which these approximations are valid .    the obtained general expressions for the eigenstates and their corresponding energies are not very complicated . as a final remark , one may therefore point out that the derivation , as presented here , has certain pedagogical merits and provides a good example of how to apply the power of matrix algebra to quantum - mechanical problems .",
