    "traditional shell - model studies have recently received a renewed interest through large scale shell model calculations in both the @xmath0 shell and the @xmath1 shells with the inclusion of the @xmath2 intruder state as well .",
    "it is now therefore fully possible to perform large - scale shell - model investigations and study the excitation spectra for systems with some 10 million basis states . with recent advances in monte carlo methods",
    "one is also able to enlarge the dimensionality of the systems under study considerably , and important information on e.g. , ground state properties has thereby been obtained .",
    "an important feature of such large scale calculations is that it allows one to probe the underlying many - body physics in a hitherto unprecedented way .",
    "the crucial starting point in all such shell - model calculations is the derivation of an effective interaction , be it either an approach based on a microscopic theory starting from the free nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) interaction or a more phenomenologically determined interaction . in shell - model studies of e.g. , the sn isotopes , one may have up to 31 valence particles or holes interacting via e.g. , an effective two - body interaction .",
    "the results of such calculations can therefore yield , when compared with the availiable body of experimental data , critical inputs to the underlying theory of the effective interaction . until very recently ,",
    "realistic shell - model effective interactions have mainly been applied to nuclei with two or a few valence particles beyond closed shells , such as the oxygen and calcium isotopes .",
    "thus , by going to the tin isotopes , in which the major neutron shell between neutron numbers 50 and 82 is being filled beyond the @xmath4sn closed shell core , we have the opportunity of testing the potential of large - scale shell - model calculations as well as the reliability of realistic effective interactions in systems with many valence particles .    clearly , although the @xmath3 interaction is of short but finite range , with typical interparticle distances of the order of @xmath5 fm , there are indications from both studies of few - body systems such as the triton and infinite nuclear matter , that at least three - body interactions , both real and effective ones , may be of importance .",
    "thus , with many valence nucleons present , such large - scale shell - model calculations may tell us how well e.g. , an effective interaction which only includes two - body terms does in reproducing properties such as excitation spectra and binding energies .",
    "this work deals therefore with various ways of deriving the effective interaction or effective operator needed in shell - model calculations , starting from the free @xmath3 interaction .",
    "normally , the problem of deriving such effective operators and interactions are solved in a limited space , the so - called model space , which is a subspace of the full hilbert space .",
    "the effective operator and interaction theory is then introduced in order to systematically take into account contributions from the complement ( the excluded space ) of the chosen model space .",
    "several formulations for such expansions of effective operators and interactions exit in the literature , following time - dependent or time - independent perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "formulations like the coupled - cluster method or exponential ansatz @xcite , the summation of the parquet class of diagrams @xcite , or the so - called @xmath6-box method with the folded - diagram formulation of kuo and co - workers @xcite have been extensively applied to systems in nuclear , atomic , molecular and solid - state physics . here",
    "we will focus on the above - mentioned @xmath6-box approach and the summation of the so - called parquet diagrams . for the description of other many - body methods such as the hypernetted - chain or the correlated basis function @xcite methods , monte - carlo related methods @xcite , unitary - correlation operator method @xcite etc .",
    "see other contributions in this volume .",
    "the @xmath6-box has been introduced in rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory as the definition of all non - folded diagrams to a given order in the expansion parameter , in nuclear physics the so - called @xmath7-matrix .",
    "the @xmath7-matrix renders the free @xmath3 interaction @xmath8 , which is repulsive at small internucleon distances , tractable for a perturbative analysis through the summation of ladders diagrams to infinite order .",
    "stated differently , the @xmath7-matrix , through the solution of the bethe - brueckner - goldstone equation , accounts for the short - range correlations involving high - lying states .",
    "folded diagrams are a class of diagrams which arise due to the removal of the dependence of the exact model - space energy in the brillouin - wigner perturbation expansion . through the @xmath6-box formulation and its derivatives , this set of diagrams can easily be summed up .",
    "in addition to the evaluation of folded diagrams and the inclusion of ladder diagrams to infinite order included in the @xmath7-matrix , there are other classes of diagrams which can be summed up .",
    "these take into account the effect of long - range correlations involving low - energy excitations .",
    "a frequently applied formalism is the tamm - dancoff ( tda ) or the random - phase ( rpa ) approximations . in their traditional formulation one",
    "allows for the summation of all particle - hole excitations , both forward - going and backward going insertions .",
    "this set of diagrams , as formulated by kirson @xcite and reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , should account for correlations arising from collective particle - hole correlations .",
    "another possibility , is to include any number of particle - particle and hole - hole correlations in the screening of particle - hole correlations .",
    "the inclusion of these kind of correlations is conventionally labelled particle - particle ( pp ) rpa .",
    "it has been used both in nuclear matter studies @xcite and in evaluations of ground state properties of closed - shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "recently , ellis , mavromatis and mther @xcite have extended the pp rpa to include the particle - hole ( ph ) rpa , though screening of two - particle - one - hole ( 2p1h ) and two - hole - one - particle ( 2h1p ) vertices was not included .",
    "the latter works can be viewed as a step towards the full summation of the parquet class of diagrams .",
    "the summation of the parquet diagrams entails a self - consistent summation of both particle - particle and hole - hole ladder diagrams and particle - hole diagrams .",
    "practical solutions to this many - body scheme for finite nuclei will be discussed here .",
    "this work falls in six sections . in the next section we present various definitions pertinent to the determination of effective interactions , with an emphasis on perturbative methods .",
    "the resummation of the ladder type of diagrams is then presented in section [ sec : sec3 ] . in that section",
    "we also discuss the summation of so - called folded diagrams which arise in the evaluation of valence space effective interactions .",
    "further perturbative corrections are also discussed and selected results for light nuclei in the @xmath9 and @xmath0 shells and for sn isotopes are presented .",
    "the summation of the tda and rpa class of diagrams is discussed in section [ sec : sec4 ] .",
    "other screening corrections are also discussed in that section .",
    "the self - consistent approach to the summation of both ladder type diagrams and screening terms through the solution of equations for the parquet class of diagrams will be presented in section [ sec : sec5 ] .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section [ sec : sec6 ] .",
    "in order to derive a microscopic approach to the effective interaction and/or operator within the framework of perturbation theory , we need to introduce various notations and definitions pertinent to the methods exposed . in this section",
    "we review how to calculate an effective operator within the framework of degenerate rayleigh - schrdinger ( rs ) perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it is common practice in perturbation theory to reduce the infinitely many degrees of freedom of the hilbert space to those represented by a physically motivated subspace , the model space . in such truncations of the hilbert space ,",
    "the notions of a projection operator @xmath10 onto the model space and its complement @xmath11 are introduced .",
    "the projection operators defining the model and excluded spaces are defined by @xmath12 and @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the dimension of the model space , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the wave functions @xmath19 are eigenfunctions of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the kinetic energy and @xmath22 and appropriately chosen one - body potential , that of the harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) in most calculations .",
    "the full hamiltonian is then rewritten as @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath8 being e.g.  the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the full hamiltonian are denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 rather than solving the full schrdinger equation above , we define an effective hamiltonian acting within the model space such that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the projection of the full wave function onto the model space , the model space wave function . in rs perturbation theory , the effective interaction @xmath30 can be written out order by order in the interaction @xmath31 as @xmath32 where terms of third and higher order also include the aforementioned folded diagrams .",
    "further , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the so - called starting energy , defined as the unperturbed energy of the interacting particles .. similarly , the exact wave function @xmath25 can now be written in terms of the model space wave function as @xmath35 the wave operator is often expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is known as the correlation operator .",
    "the correlation operator generates the component of the wave function in the @xmath11-space and must therefore contain at least one perturbation . observing that @xmath38 , we see that the correlation operator @xmath37 has the properties @xmath39 since @xmath40 determines the wave operator only when it operates to the right on the model space , i.e. , only the @xmath41 part is defined , the term @xmath42 never appears in the theory , and we could therefore add the conditions @xmath43 and @xmath44 to eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi1 ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following choice for @xmath37 @xmath45 this has been the traditional choice in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the wave operator @xmath46 can then be ordered in terms of the number of interactions with the perturbation @xmath31 @xmath47 where @xmath48 means that we have @xmath49 @xmath31 terms .",
    "explicitely , the above equation reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the unperturbed energies of the @xmath10-space and @xmath11-space states defined by @xmath52 .",

    "the second term in the above equation corresponds to @xmath53 while the third and fourth define @xmath54 .",
    "note that the fourth term diverges in case we have a degenerate or nearly degenerate model space .",
    "it is actually divergencies like these which are to be removed by the folded diagram procedure to be discussed in the next section .",
    "terms like these arise due to the introduction of an energy independent perturbative expansion .",

    "this method ensures a numerical stable treatment with large numbers of mesh points in momentum space . from the principal value",
    "integral we can in turn define the real and imaginary part of @xmath166 , see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for technical details .",
    "the matrix @xmath166 is solved only once and transformed to a harmonic oscillator basis in the lab from the relative and center of mass system , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the second step is to solve eq .",

    "( [ eq : approx12channel ] ) resides in the dimensionality of @xmath162 discussed in section [ sec : sec3 ] .",
    "what conditions our truncation of @xmath162 and the number @xmath139 , is dictated by the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) independence on the chosen oscillator parameter @xmath263 .",
    "this choice leads to the inclusion of more than ten major shells in the computation of the @xmath7-matrix . for a given @xmath64 value",
    ", the total number of two - body states needed can then be of the order @xmath350 .",
    "_ our first approximation _ is therefore to truncate the available space of single - particle states to be within @xmath351 major shells . the choice being conditioned by the bhf criteria and the possibility to store these large matrices in the ram of available computing facilities .",
    "if we choose to use a double - partitioned model space , we need to sum up further diagrams with particle - particle intermediate states .",
    "these two steps lead then to the first iteration of the ladders , i.e. , @xmath352}_{(0)}-g_f.\\ ] ] it contains both hole - hole and particle - particle intermediate states and is a complex matrix .",
    "the external single - particle legs can be particles or holes . only unperturbed single - particle energies enter the definition of the two - body propagators .",
    "the third step is to calculate the first iteration for the rings , namely @xmath353}=\\left(g_f+l_{(0)}\\right)\\hat{{\\cal g}}^{[13 ] }               \\left(g_f+l_{(0)}\\right ) +                \\left(g_f+l_{(0)}\\right)\\hat{{\\cal g}}^{[13]}r_{(0)}^{[13 ] } ,      \\label{eq : ring13first}\\ ] ] and @xmath354}=\\left(g_f+l_{(0)}\\right)\\hat{{\\cal g}}^{[14 ] }               \\left(g_f+l_{(0)}\\right ) +                \\left(g_f+l_{(0)}\\right)\\hat{{\\cal g}}^{[14]}r_{(0)}^{[14]}.      \\label{eq : ring14first}\\ ] ] the equations for @xmath333 and @xmath339 are all defined within a truncated hilbert space .",
    "they can therefore be recast into matrix equations of finite dimensionality .",

    "this is done employing eqs .",
    "( [ eq:13channel ] ) and ( [ eq:14channel ] ) . with these contributions",
    ", we can now obtain the vertex function @xmath280 after the first interaction @xmath355}+r_{(0)}^{[14]}.\\ ] ] the fourth step is to compute the self - energy and thereby obtain new single - particle energies .",
    "in so doing , care has to be exercised in order to avoid double - counting problems",
    ". a thourough discussion of this topic can be found in ref .",
    "more details will also be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . through dispersion relations",

    "( [ eq : selfconstbasis ] ) are obtained by diagonalizing a matrix of dimension @xmath357 , @xmath358 the quantum number @xmath49 of the single - particle state @xmath359 .",
    "the fifth step is to repeat steps 1 - 4 with the new single - particle energies till a predetermined self - consistency is obtained .",
    "but now the rings have to be included in all equations , i.e. , we solve eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gammap])-([eq : ring14next ] ) .",
    "the final vertex @xmath280 can then be used to define a new effective interaction to be applied in shell model studies , where many more diagrams are considered than in present state of the art calculations , see e.g. , fig .",
    "8 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a list of diagrams to sixth order entering the definition of the irreducible vertex @xmath280 .",
    "the reader should always keep in mind that the many - body scheme we have focussed on is only one of several possible ways of calculating effective interactions .",
    "other methods are also discussed in this volume .",
    "the aim of this work has however been to show how one can practically implement the parquet equations in order to obtain effective interactions for the nuclear shell model .",
    "the emphasis here has been to connect these equations with state of the art approaches to effective interactions .",
    "thus , how to recover the standard @xmath7-matrix equation and the tda and rpa equations from the parquet equations has been outlined .",
    "applications of this many - body scheme will be presented elsewhere @xcite , although in depth discussions and applications of both the @xmath7-matrix , folded diagrams and other perturbative resummations can be found in e.g. , refs .",
    "there are also subtle technical details which deal with double - counting problems in the outlined iterative parquet scheme that we have left out , due to space limits , in the discussion .",
    "we take the liberty here to refer to e.g. , refs .",
    "they will also be discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the scheme",
    "we have sketched , there are obviously other important many - body contributions at the two - body level which can not be generated by the two - body parquet equations .",
    "we have also omitted any discussion of three - body terms .",
    "such terms could be generated if we were to solve the three - body parquet equations , see lande and smith @xcite .",
    "an implementation of the three - body parquet equations is in progress .",
    "three - body terms , as also mentioned in the introduction , are believed to be important , it should just suffice to mention studies of the triton @xcite . with two - body forces",
    "only one is also not able to reproduce properly the nuclear matter saturation point @xcite . in connection with three - body contributions",
    "one has to carefully distinguish between three - body forces and effective three - body interactions . to understand this point",
    "consider the following arguments from studies of infinite nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "the last three years have seen quite some advances in many - body studies of dense infinite matter , see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent surveys .",
    "these results can be summarized as follows .",
    "firstly , new @xmath3 interactions such as the cd - bonn potential @xcite , different nijmegen interactions @xcite and the recent argonne @xmath360 interaction @xcite all fit the set of scattering data of the nijmegen group with a @xmath361 per datum close to 1 .",
    "all these interactions , when applied to calculations of the equation of state ( eos ) , yield essentially similar equations of state up to densities of @xmath362 nuclear matter saturation density for both pure neutron matter and @xmath363-stable matter when the non - relativistic lowest - order brueckner theory ( lob ) is used",
    ". other properties like the symmetry energy and proton fractions do also show a similar quantitative agreement , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "secondly , the inclusion of more complicated many - body terms at the two - body @xcite level does not alter this picture and even the recent summation of three - hole line diagrams of baldo and co - workers @xcite results in an eos which is close to lob when a continuous choice is used for the single - particle energies in matter @xcite .",
    "the latter are examples of effective three - body contributions .",
    "these findings are also in line with recent works on the energy of pure neutron drops , where three - body clusters are included @xcite , and large - scale shell - model calculations of sn isotopes including effective three - body interactions @xcite .",
    "differences do however occur when one introduces real three - body forces .",
    "these are necessary in order to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter @xcite and the binding energy of light nuclei @xcite .",
    "the reader may then eventually ask why do we bother at all to solve the two - body set of parquet equations when most likely these new effective interactions will not cure any of the problems seen in shell model studies or nuclear matter .",
    "one needs at least to include some realistic three - body force and thereby to solve the three - body parquet equations .",
    "the problem however with real three - body forces is that presently we have no serious candidates which exhibit the same level of quality and sophistication as the @xmath3 interactions mentioned above .",
    "the introduction of such forces lead therefore to strong model dependencies .",
    "moreover , to assess properly many - body terms at the two - body level is an important , and not yet solved , problem per se .",
    "the parquet equations allow one also to include in a self - consistent way several many - body terms , fulfill crossing symmetries and satisfy certain sum rules .",
    "in addition , the green s function formalism can be taylored for finite temperatures .",
    "this is clearly of interest for studies of infinite matter at finite temperature , such as e.g. , dense matter occuring in a newly born neutron star .",
    "the application of the parquet equation in nuclear and neutron matter will also allow for a consistent treatment of screening effects relevant for the pairing problem .",
    "such work is in progress .",
    "i have greatly benefitted from many discussions on parquet theory with andy jackson . moreover , many interactions with david dean , paul ellis , torgeir engeland , tom kuo , herbert mther , artur polls , eivind osnes and andres zuker have hopefully matured some of the ideas exposed , although any eventual flaw(s ) is(are ) obviously to be retraced to the author .",
