    "[ fig5](c ) we compare the effects of the anisotropic ( @xmath45 ) and isotropic ( @xmath46 ) coupling for a mn - doped qd with three confined shells and in the presence of a full @xmath16-@xmath16 coulomb interaction ( @xmath33 ) . for the anisotropic coupling the triplet state is split into nine doubly degenerate levels . in this case , both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are good quantum numbers , and therefore , @xmath131 and @xmath132 breaks the mn spin degeneracy into six . as the energy of the state with @xmath131 and @xmath48 is equal to the energy of the state @xmath132 and @xmath133 , these six states are double degenerate .",
    "the @xmath127 configurations split into three , where the degeneracy is given by @xmath48 , i.e. , the @xmath127 configurations are degenerate and labeled by @xmath88 , as for the two electrons interacting with the mn via an anisotropic @xmath16-mn interaction .",
    "the singlet state is also split into three doubly degenerate levels .",
    "one way to probe the indirect @xmath16-mn interaction is by performing a circularly polarized photoluminescence experiment of quantum dots containing a single mn spin and confining three or more electrons . in this case",
    ", the indirect @xmath16-mn coupling gives rise to a fine structure of both initial and final states of the emission process .",
    "in conclusion , we presented a microscopic model of interacting electrons coupled with a magnetic ion spin localized in the center of a self - assembled quantum dot .",
    "we showed that the electrons occupying finite angular momentum orbitals interact with the localized spin through an effective exchange interaction mediated by electron - electron interactions .",
    "the effective interaction for @xmath3-shell electrons is obtained using exact diagonalization of the microscopic hamiltonian as a function of the number of electronic shells , shell spacing , and anisotropy of the exchange interaction .",
    "it is shown that the effective interaction can be engineered to be either ferro- or antiferromagnetic , depending on the quantum - dot parameters .",
