    "the proof consists in showing that it is possible to analytically continue the amplitude @xmath131 from the region @xmath132 to the physical region @xmath133 and to reveal the singularities of the amplitude , which depend only on the intermediate momentum lines of the diagram .",
    "the derivation of the proof for two internal lines leads to the result @xmath134w_1(-m_1 ^ 2,z)w_2(-m_2 ^ 2,z)c(-m_1 ^ 2,-m_2 ^ 2,z),\\ ] ] where @xmath135^{1/2}}{8z } $ $ $ $ \\times\\int d\\omega_n \\phi\\biggl\\{{\\bf n}\\biggl[\\frac{-u(m^2_1,m^2_2,z)}{4z}\\biggr]^{1/2}\\frac{i(m^2_1-m^2_2+z ) } { 2\\sqrt{z}}\\biggr\\}.\\ ] ] moreover , @xmath120 and @xmath136[c-(\\sqrt{a}-\\sqrt{b})^2].\\ ] ] the integration in ( [ cfunction ] ) is performed with respect to all the directions of the three - dimensional unit vector @xmath137 , and the @xmath138 vector has only a fourth component @xmath139 .",
    "the proof of ( [ cutkosky ] ) can be extended to diagrams with an arbitrary number of internal lines .",
    "it follows from these results that amplitudes calculated in the non - anticommutative scalar field theory will not change the analyticity properties of the theory in any finite region of the momentum variables , and the validity of the cutkosky cutting rules leads to a proof of the unitarity of this field theory .",
    "the singularities of the amplitude in the momentum variables come only from the zeros of the denominator . from this",
    ", it follows that the landau and cutkosky analyses can be applied and all necessary conditions for the fulfillment of unitarity are satisfied .",
    "landau required that the amplitudes were regular at infinity in the momentum plane .",
    "he was then able to perform a wick contour rotation ( @xmath140 ) and relate the zeros of a diagram to the zeros of a known quadratic form in the external momenta subsequent to an application of the feynman @xmath141 parameterization .",
    "in euclidean momentum space , our amplitudes are not affected by possible essential singularities at infinity and the positions of singularities of diagrams are likewise not affected .",
    "when we analytically continue to minkowski spacetime , all integrals converge and the amplitudes are regular at infinity for @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
