    "the existence of extra spatial dimensions remains an open question in theoretical physics . the answer to this question",
    "is closely linked to attempts at super - unification , which has become a modern holy grail . in turn , the existence of extra spatial or temporal dimensions may be inferred by the detection of spatial or temporal variations in the values of coupling constants , such as the fine structure constant , @xmath1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "this constant provides a measure of the strength of the electromagnetic interaction and is truly fundamental because it is dimensionless and thus independent of any system of units .",
    "other such constants are the electron - to - proton mass ratio , @xmath12 , the proton gyromagnetic factor @xmath2 , as well as the constant @xmath10 defined as @xmath17 which combines all three .",
    "apart from the question of extra dimensions , any confirmed detection of a variation in the value of any of these ` constants ' would in itself be a ground - breaking result .",
    "for example , in some popular models this variation is related to violation of the principle of equivalence .",
    "there have been several attempts to constrain the variation of fundamental constants either experimentally or observationally .",
    "atomic clocks ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the oklo nuclear reactor @xcite provide local , i.e. earthbound and relatively recent , @xmath18 , constraints .",
    "the cosmic microwave background provides constraints at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "further constraints may be obtained from big bang nucleosynthesis data ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , one very promising way to detect such variations is astronomical spectroscopy of gas clouds which intersect the lines of sight to distant quasars .",
    "this technique allows one to obtain constraints essentially over all of the intermediate redshift range , which is crucial for probing variations with cosmic time .",
    "additionally , results achieve very high precision , due to the advent of 10-m class telescopes equipped with state - of - the art high - resolution spectrographs , in particular keck / hires in hawaii and vlt / uves in chile .    in this type of work ,",
    "the gas clouds probed are often damped lyman @xmath1 systems ( dlas ) .",
    "these systems have high neutral hydrogen column densities ( @xmath20 ) at precisely determined redshifts , thus providing excellent probes of the bulk neutral atomic hydrogen in the distant universe .",
    "furthermore , dlas contain many different heavy elements which absorb in the rest - frame ultraviolet ( for atomic species ) or millimetre ( for molecular species ) , giving rise to a multitude of absorption lines . with the latest generation of optical telescopes rest - frame ultraviolet lines",
    "can be observed with resolutions of the order of 6  so that redshifts can be determined to six significant digits .",
    "this is crucial as all methods using this type of data aim to detect small shifts induced by a possible variation of constants which are of different magnitude for different transitions .",
    "using such data , @xcite and @xcite developed the highly sensitive _ many - multiplet method _ and in a series of papers applied it to rest - frame ultraviolet _",
    "atomic _ quasar absorption lines , obtained with keck / hires .",
    "their work provided evidence that @xmath1 is smaller at redshifts @xmath21 at the fractional level of @xmath22 @xcite . after thorough investigation @xcite and @xcite ruled out a large range of known systematic effects .",
    "however the issue remains controversial after another group found no evidence for a change in @xmath1 using vlt / uves spectra .",
    "strong constraints on variations in the electron - to - proton mass ratio , @xmath12 , can also be obtained from optical quasar absorption studies @xcite .",
    "the first confirmed _ molecular _ hydrogen quasar absorption line detections were obtained by @xcite , and confirmed by @xcite .",
    "however , although the large number of h@xmath23 transitions in the lyman and werner bands have different dependencies on @xmath12 , making them useful probes of @xmath12-variation , unfortunately the relatively small fraction of dlas in which h@xmath24 is detected has limited this work so far .",
    "nevertheless , the recent study of two high signal - to - noise spectra has yielded hints that @xmath12 may have been smaller at redshifts between @xmath252.53.1 @xcite .",
    "( i.e.  @xmath26 ) compared with this paper . ]",
    "a potentially more sensitive approach is possible when , as well as rest - frame uv , rest - frame 21-cm absorption from cold neutral hydrogen is also detected . in such cases ,",
    "variability of the constant @xmath10 , defined above , can be investigated .",
    "because the ratio of 21-cm to uv transition frequencies is proportional to @xmath10 , it can be shown that , if both uv and 21-cm absorption occurs at the same physical location , the relative change in the value of @xmath10 between its value at redshift @xmath27 and its value in a terrestrial lab is related to the observed absorption redshifts for rest - frame 21-cm and uv ,  and , according to @xmath28 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , because @xmath12 enters in via the definition of @xmath10 , results on the variation of @xmath12 may also be obtained , allowing completely independent tests of  results obtained more directly from molecular absorption lines . however , application of this method is limited by the fact that there are only @xmath2518 dlas for which absorption has been observed both in the optical and in the radio ( * ? ? ?",
    "* contains a detailed list ) .",
    "consequently , there is only a handful of results based on this method @xcite . among these ,",
    "a high - resolution spectrum from a 10-m class telescope is used only once and for a single object @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there has been no attempt to apply this method to a sample consisting of more than one object .",
    "this is important for two reasons :    1 .",
    "any systematic effects due to spatial non - coincidence of hydrogen and heavy elements can only be detected if a sample of objects is used .",
    "2 .   to detect any space - time variation of @xmath10 , one needs several observations , covering a range in redshift and direction .",
    "the first results from such an approach were briefly presented in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explain in detail how these results were obtained and extend our original sample of eight absorbers with a newly discovered 21-cm absorber .",
    "we have filled the gap in the literature by applying this method to a sample comprising _ all _ the best available 21-cm absorption data in conjunction with the highest - resolution uv data available .",
    "the sample is made up of nine absorption systems situated along the line of sight to nine quasars covering the absorption redshift range @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "the paper s structure is as follows : in we describe our data sample .",
    "we describe our methods and results in .",
    "our results are discussed in .",
    "details of the data used in this work are given in and are discussed below .",
    "our data sample is made up of nine quasar absorption systems along the lines of sight to nine quasars .",
    "each system shows both 21-cm and uv absorption ( rest frame ) along the line of sight to a different quasar .",
    "rest - frame uv absorption is observed red - shifted in the optical region , and rest - frame 21-cm is observed red - shifted at longer radio wavelengths . in this paper",
    "we use the labels uv and 21-cm to distinguish the two types of observations that we use .",
    "figures  [ fig:0952 ] to [ fig:0438 ] show the 21-cm and uv data registered to a common velocity scale .",
    "we note that all data have been corrected to the heliocentric frame .",
    "the original radio 21-cm absorption spectra were not available for this work , apart from the data for quasar  which were kindly provided by art wolfe .",
    "therefore , we digitised the 21-cm plots from the literature ( see the references in ) using the dexter application @xcite , available at nasa / ads for on - line scanned papers or , for pdf plots , the stand - alone version available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dexter .",
    "the initial step was to digitise each spectrum , obtaining flux / abscissa values .",
    "then a linear wavelength scale was derived for , and assigned to , each spectrum by carefully measuring velocity or frequency points on the x - axis of the plot .",
    "this second step dominates the uncertainty in the zero - point of the velocity / frequency scale but is nevertheless not an important source of error . as an example , we digitised a postscript plot of the  1808  absorption feature obtained with keck / hires and compared the resulting redshift to that obtained from the original data .",
    "the two redshifts differed by just @xmath31 .",
    "a very conservative upper limit on the absolute velocity / frequency uncertainty is given by half of the digitised pixel size in each case .",
    "we checked the maximum contribution this zero - point error could make to the final estimate for  for each quasar and , in all cases , this was less than 25 per cent of the statistical - plus - systematic ( i.e.  increased ) error bars illustrated in .",
    "we therefore stress that the digitisation process generally contributes a small uncertainty in comparing the 21-cm and uv absorption redshifts .",
    "redshift uncertainties and details of the observations and data reduction can be found in the references listed in . however , since no redshift uncertainty is given for the radio spectrum of  in @xcite we used the uncertainty from @xcite , as these are the same observers , using the same instrument to perform a similar type of observation .",
    "optical ( rest - frame uv ) high - resolution echelle spectral data for eight of the nine quasars were taken from the european southern observatory s ( eso s ) archive .",
    "these were originally observed with the uves spectrograph on the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "data reduction was carried out with the eso / uves pipeline @xcite , modified to improve the flux extraction and the wavelength calibration precision .",
    "post - pipeline processing was carried out using the custom - written code uves popler.mim/uves_popler.html ] for each quasar , the extracted echelle orders from all exposures were combined to form a single 1-dimensional spectrum , with cosmic ray signatures being rejected by a sigma - clipping algorithm during the combination .",
    "a continuum was constructed by iteratively fitting a series of overlapping polynomials , rejecting discrepant pixels at each iteration until convergence . for one of the quasars ( )",
    "we have also included the part of the absorption spectrum for  1808  from a keck / hires observation , provided by art wolfe .",
    "this spectrum was reduced with the dedicated keck / hires pipeline , makee , written by tom barlow .    for quasar",
    "we digitised an absorption plot from @xcite for a single heavy element species .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,<,^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath32  from @xcite ; @xmath33  @xmath7 .",
    "the main result of this work is that the data show no evidence for any time variation of .",
    "it can be seen from that the  points show significant scatter beyond that expected based on their statistical ( i.e.  original ) error bars .",
    "the error in result 1 directly reflects this scatter . after taking into account individual redshift errors and propagating them statistically",
    ", we need to increase individual uncertainties so as to obtain a  @xmath34 about the weighted mean .",
    "even so , this procedure ( method 3 ) gives an overall error which is essentially the same as for result 1 .",
    "this simply says that _ the scatter in  completely dominates any errors in individual redshift measurements_. this is an _ a posteriori _ justification of the validity of method 1 , in which individual redshift errors were neglected and not propagated statistically .",
    "the importance of this has not been realised before , as this is the first time that  has been determined for a sample of objects .",
    "if one determined  for a single quasar , there would be no scatter , but there would still be a hidden and unquantifiable systematic error . in practise , of course , for a sample of systems , as we have here , this additional error has random sign and magnitude and can be treated statistically .",
    "however , our result shows that any purely statistical determination of uncertainties , i.e.  without taking the observed scatter into account , would inevitably underestimate the true uncertainty .    for example , @xcite used neutral carbon lines (  and @xmath35 ) observed in the keck / hires absorption spectrum of , to obtain  @xmath36 .",
    "for the same object we obtain  @xmath37 .",
    "the similarity in the statistical errors demonstrates our point . here",
    "our statistical error is just @xmath38^{0.5 }   \\ , \\ ] ] and the systematic error is simply the value for the additional uncertainty @xmath39 which gives a  value of 1 ( )",
    ". we can only determine this because we have several objects .",
    "the central value of @xcite is different because they used a  value which is a weighted mean for observed components @xcite and leads to a value very close to .",
    "further explanation of the discrepancy in the central value may come from the fact that , in this system , we have used 23 distinct uv heavy element transitions with strongest components well defined within a few .",
    "the preponderance of the scatter over redshift uncertainties in determining the overall error also eliminates any worry about errors introduced via the digitisation process .",
    "we emphasise that having the original digital data would not have lead to appreciably different results in this work .",
    "what does this quantified scatter , @xmath39 , mean ?",
    "simply from looking at the 21-cm and uv absorption profiles in figs .",
    "[ fig:0952][fig:0438 ] , it clearly means that the assumption that 21-cm and uv absorption occurs at the same physical location is not correct . in other words the 21-cm and uv absorbing gases",
    "are randomly offset in space .",
    "a rough estimate of the average line - of - sight velocity difference is given by @xmath40  .",
    "we may explain this difference qualitatively .",
    "the emitting 21-cm quasar source may appear to have a large angular size to the absorber .",
    "a 21-cm sight - line can then intersect a cold , neutral hydrogen cloud with little or no heavy elements , whilst a uv / optical sight - line can intersect another cloud with heavy elements at quite a different velocity .",
    "such a large angular size may be due to the combined effects both of physical proximity of the absorber to the quasar and of intrinsic size of the radio emitting region .",
    "an alternative explanation involving small scale motion of the interstellar medium has been suggested by @xcite in the case of the @xmath41  velocity difference between 21-cm and mm absorption lines .",
    "the robustness of our  and  results , as well as our estimate of @xmath42 , can be investigated by means of alternative calculations .",
    "summarises the simple tests we have carried out .",
    "all results quoted here have been obtained by applying method 3 .",
    "firstly , if we use  directly from the literature , we obtain , for ,  ( with  from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ( with  @xmath7 ) , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath43 , respectively , and in units of @xmath45 ( row 2 in ) .",
    "if , additionally , we exclude any results for  and , we obtain @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath46 ( row 3 in ) .",
    "we have also fitted gaussians to the 21-cm absorption profiles and used these to calculate , i.e. we used the location of the minimum in the fitted gaussian profile rather than the pixel of minimum intensity .",
    "we then obtained @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath48 ( row 4 in ) .",
    "finally , we have investigated what happens if one includes the  lines in the calculations as well .",
    "this gives @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath50 .",
    "note that , because we include , we have no problem calculating @xmath52 ( ) for quasars ,  and .",
    "it is thus obvious that our results are relatively insensitive to the method used to estimate absorption redshifts , and , perhaps , even to the ionisation level of the transitions used .",
    "the dominant factor is the scatter due to the velocity mismatch between 21-cm and uv transitions . because the uncertainties in our determinations of uv redshifts are small when compared to this velocity mismatch",
    ", we do not expect that standard voigt profile fitting of the uv absorption features would significantly affect our results either .",
    "the mean line - of - sight velocity differences may become comparable in magnitude to individual errors in redshift measurements only if a much larger ( @xmath53 ) sample of 21 cm / uv absorbers is obtained : the average uncertainty per absorption system due to the velocity offset is now @xmath54 but with 100 absorbers , or so , we would expect this to be reduced by a factor of @xmath55 , i.e. to @xmath56 .",
    "a definitive answer to the question of whether  varies , or not , with cosmic time , will have to wait until then .",
    "another important result is that , even when we conservatively assume  @xmath7 , our measurements of  imply constraints on  which are independent of the current possible detections of @xcite .",
    "these authors find a combined ( unweighted ) value of @xmath57 from two h@xmath24-bearing absorbers while we obtain a less direct constraint of @xmath58 .",
    "this new constraint , based on four high - redshift 21-cm / uv absorbers combined with the assumption of @xmath59 , serves as an internally robust , independent comparison to the h@xmath24 measurements .",
