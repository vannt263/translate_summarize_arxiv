    "the development of physics relied considerably on the copernician principle , which states that we are not living in a particular place in the universe and stating that the laws of physics do not differ from one point in spacetime to another .",
    "this contrasts with the aristotelian point of view in which the laws on earth and in heavens differ .",
    "it is however natural to question this assumption .",
    "indeed , it is difficult to imagine a change of the form of physical laws ( e.g. a newtonian gravitation force behaving as the inverse of the square of the distance on earth and as another power somewhere else ) but a smooth change in the physical constants is much easier to conceive .    comparing and reproducing experiments is also a root of the scientific approach which makes sense only if the laws of nature does not depend on time and space .",
    "this hypothesis of constancy of the constants plays an important role in particular in astronomy and cosmology where the redshift measures the look - back time .",
    "ignoring the possibility of varying constants could lead to a distorted view of our universe and if such a variation is established corrections would have to be applied .",
    "it is thus of importance to investigate this possibility especially as the measurements become more and more precise .",
    "obviously , the constants have not undergone huge variations on solar system scales and geological time scales and one is looking for tiny effects .",
    "besides , the question of the values of the constants is central to physics and one can hope to explain them dynamically as predicted by some high - energy theories .",
    "testing for the constancy of the constants is thus part of the tests of general relativity .",
    "let us emphasize that this latter step is analogous to the transition from the newtonian description of mechanics in which space and time were just a static background in which matter was evolving to the relativistic description where spacetime becomes a dynamical quantity determined by the einstein equations ( damour , 2001 ) .    before discussing the properties of the constants of nature",
    ", we must have an idea of which constants to consider .",
    "first , all constants of physics do not play the same role , and some have a much deeper one than others .",
    "following levy - leblond ( 1979 ) , we can define three classes of fundamental constants , _ class a _ being the class of the constants characteristic of particular objects , _ class b _ being the class of constants characteristic of a class of physical phenomena , and _ class c _ being the class of universal constants .",
    "indeed , the status of a constant can change with time .",
    "for instance , the velocity of light was a initially a type a constant ( describing a property of light ) which then became a type b constant when it was realized that it was related to electro - magnetic phenomena and , to finish , it ended as a type c constant ( it enters many laws of physics from electromagnetism to relativity including the notion of causality ... ) .",
    "it has even become a much more fundamental constant since it has been chosen as the definition of the meter ( petley , 1983 ) .",
    "a more conservative definition of a fundamental constant would thus be to state that it is _ any parameter _ that can not be calculated with our present knowledge of physics , i.e. a free parameter of our theory at hand .",
    "each free parameter of a theory is in fact a challenge for future theories to explain its value .",
    "how many fundamental constants should we consider ?",
    "the set of constants which are conventionally considered as fundamental ( flowers and petley , 2001 ) consists of the electron charge @xmath0 , the electron mass @xmath1 , the proton mass @xmath2 , the reduced planck constant @xmath3 , the velocity of light in vacuum @xmath4 , the avogadro constant @xmath5 , the boltzmann constant @xmath6 , the newton constant @xmath7 , the permeability and permittivity of space , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the latter has a fixed value in the si system of unit ( @xmath10 ) which is implicit in the definition of the ampere ; @xmath8 is then fixed by the relation @xmath11 .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath5 in the former list has been debated a lot ( see e.g. birge , 1929 ) . to compare with",
    ", the minimal standard model of particle physics plus gravitation that describes the four known interactions depends on 20 free parameters ( cahn , 1996 ; hogan , 2000 ) : the yukawa coefficients determining the masses of the six quark @xmath12 and three lepton @xmath13 flavors , the higgs mass and vacuum expectation value , three angles and a phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix , a phase for the qcd vacuum and three coupling constants @xmath14 for the gauge group @xmath15 respectively . below the @xmath16 mass , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "combine to form the electro - magnetic coupling constant @xmath19    the number of free parameters indeed depends on the physical model at hand ( see weinberg , 1983 ) .",
    "this issue has to be disconnected from the number of required fundamental dimensionful constants .",
    "duff , okun and veneziano ( 2002 ) recently debated this question , respectively arguing for none , three and two ( see also wignall , 2000 )",
    ". arguing for no fundamental constant leads to consider them simply as conversion parameters . some of them are , like the boltzmann constant , but some others play a deeper role in the sense that when a physical quantity becomes of the same order of this constant new phenomena appear , this is the case e.g. of @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are associated respectively to quantum and relativistic effects .",
    "okun ( 1991 ) considered that only three fundamental constants are necessary , the underlying reason being that in the international system of units which has 7 base units an 17 derived units , four of the seven base units are in fact derived ( ampere , kelvin , mole and candela ) .",
    "the three remaining base units ( meter , second and kilogram ) are then associated to three fundamental constants ( @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "they can be seen as limiting quantities : @xmath4 is associated to the maximum velocity and @xmath3 to the unit quantum of angular momentum and sets a minimum of uncertainty whereas @xmath7 is not directly associated to any physical quantity ( see martins 2002 who argues that @xmath7 is the limiting potential for a mass that does not form a black hole ) . in the framework of quantum field theory + general relativity",
    ", it seems that this set of three constants has to be considered and it allows to classify the physical theories ( see figure  [ fig0 ] ) .",
    "however , veneziano ( 1986 ) argued that in the framework of string theory one requires only two dimensionful fundamental constants , @xmath4 and the string length @xmath20 .",
    "the use of @xmath3 seems unnecessary since it combines with the string tension to give @xmath20 . in the case of the goto - nambu action @xmath21 and",
    "the planck constant is just given by @xmath22 .",
    "in this view , @xmath3 has not disappeared but has been promoted to the role of a uv cut - off that removes both the infinities of quantum field theory and singularities of general relativity .",
    "this situation is analogous to pure quantum gravity ( novikov and zeldovich , 1982 ) where @xmath3 and @xmath7 never appear separately but only in the combination @xmath23 so that only @xmath4 and @xmath24 are needed .",
    "volovik ( 2002 ) considered the analogy with quantum liquids .",
    "there , an observer knows both the effective and microscopic physics so that he can judge whether the fundamental constants of the effective theory remain fundamental constants of the microscopic theory .",
    "the status of a constant depends on the considered theory ( effective or microscopic ) and , more interestingly , on the observer measuring them , i.e. on whether this observer belongs to the world of low - energy quasi - particles or to the microscopic world .",
    "resolving this issue is indeed far beyond the scope of this article and can probably be considered more as an epistemological question than a physical one .",
    "but , as the discussion above tends to show , the answer depends on the theoretical framework considered [ see also cohen - tannoudji ( 1985 ) for arguments to consider the boltzmann constant as a fundamental constant ] . a more pragmatic approach is then to choose a theoretical framework , so that the set of undetermined fixed parameters is fully known and then to wonder why they have the values they have and if they are constant .",
    "we review in this article both the status of the experimental constraints on the variation of fundamental constants and the theoretical motivations for considering such variations . in section  [ sec_2 ] ,",
    "we recall dirac s argument that initiated the consideration of time varying constants and we briefly discuss how it is linked to anthropic arguments .",
    "then , since the fundamental constants are entangled with the theory of measurement , we make some very general comments on the consequences of metrology . in sections  [ sec_4 ] and  [ sec_3 ]",
    ", we review the observational constraints respectively on the variation of the fine structure and of gravitational constants .",
    "indeed , we have to keep in mind that the obtained constraints depend on underlying assumptions on a certain set of other constants .",
    "we summarize more briefly in section  [ sec_5 ] , the constraints on other constants and we give , in section  [ sec_7 ] , some hints of the theoretical motivations arising mainly from grand unified theories , kaluza - klein and string theories .",
    "we also discuss a number of cosmological models taking these variations into account . for recent shorter reviews ,",

    "notations : * in this work , we use si units and the following values of the fundamental constants today @xmath25 for the velocity of light , the reduced planck constant , the newton constant , the masses of the electron , proton and neutron , and the charge of the electron .",
    "we also define @xmath26 and the following dimensionless ratios @xmath27 which characterize respectively the strength of the electro - magnetic , weak , strong and gravitational forces and the electron - proton mass ratio , @xmath28 is the proton gyro - magnetic factor .",
    "note that the relation ( [ fort ] ) between two quantities that depend strongly on energy ; this will be discussed in more details in section  [ sec_5 ] .",
    "we introduce the notations @xmath29 respectively for the bohr radius , the hydrogen ionization energy and the rydberg constant .    while working in cosmology , we assume that the universe is described by a friedmann - lematre spacetime @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the cosmic time , @xmath32 the scale factor and @xmath33 the metric of the spatial sections .",
    "we define the redshift as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the value of the scale factor today while @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the frequencies at emission and today .",
    "we decompose the hubble constant today as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a dimensionless number , and the density of the universe today is given by @xmath40",
    "the question of the constancy of the constants of physics was probably first addressed by dirac ( 1937 , 1938 , 1979 ) who expressed , in his `` large numbers hypothesis '' , the opinion that very large ( or small ) dimensionless universal constants can not be pure mathematical numbers and must not occur in the basic laws of physics .",
    "he suggested , on the basis of this numerological principle , that these large numbers should rather be considered as variable parameters characterizing the state of the universe .",
    "dirac formed the five dimensionless ratios @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 and asked the question of which of these ratio is constant as the universe evolves . usually , only @xmath46 and @xmath47 vary as the inverse of the cosmic time ( note that with the value of the density chosen by dirac , the universe is not flat so that @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "dirac then noticed that @xmath50 , representing the relative magnitude of electrostatic and gravitational forces between a proton and an electron , was of the same order as @xmath51 representing the age of the universe in atomic time so that the five previous numbers can be `` harmonized '' if one assumes that @xmath43 and @xmath46 vary with time and scale as the inverse of the cosmic time represents roughly the inverse of the number of times an electron orbits around a proton during the age of the universe .",
    "already , this suggested a link between micro - physics and cosmological scales . ] .",
    "this implies that the intensity of all gravitational effects decrease with a rate of about @xmath52 and that @xmath53 ( since @xmath47 is constant ) which corresponds to a flat universe .",
    "kothari ( 1938 ) and chandrasekhar ( 1939 ) were the first to point out that some astronomical consequences of this statement may be detectable .",
    "similar ideas were expressed by milne ( 1937 ) .",
    "dicke ( 1961 ) pointed out that in fact the density of the universe is determined by its age , this age being related to the time needed to form galaxies , stars , heavy nuclei ... this led him to formulate that the presence of an observer in the universe places constraints on the physical laws that can be observed .",
    "in fact , what is meant by observer is the existence of ( highly ? ) organized systems and the anthropic principle can be seen as a rephrasing of the question `` why is the universe the way it is ? '' ( hogan , 2000 ) .",
    "carter ( 1974 , 1976 , 1983 ) , who actually coined the term `` anthropic principle '' , showed that the numerological coincidence found by dirac can be derived from physical models of stars and the competition between the weakness of gravity with respect to nuclear fusion .",
    "carr and rees ( 1979 ) then showed how one can scale up from atomic to cosmological scales only by using combinations of @xmath41 , @xmath43 and @xmath54 .",
    "dicke ( 1961 , 1962b ) brought mach s principle into the discussion and proposed ( brans and dicke , 1961 ) a theory of gravitation based on this principle .",
    "in this theory the gravitational constant is replaced by a scalar field which can vary both in space and time .",
    "it follows that , for cosmological solutions , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 is expressible in terms of an arbitrary parameter @xmath59 as @xmath60 .",
    "einstein gravity is recovered when @xmath61 .",
    "this predicts that @xmath62 and @xmath63 whereas @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath47 are kept constant .",
    "this kind of theory was further generalized to obtain various functional dependences for @xmath7 in the formalization of scalar - tensor theories of gravitation ( see e.g. damour and esposito - farse , 1992 ) .",
    "the first extension of dirac s idea to non - gravitational forces was proposed by jordan ( 1937 , 1939 ) who still considered that the weak interaction and the proton to electron mass ratio were constant .",
    "he realized that the constants has to become dynamical fields and used the action @xmath64,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath65 and @xmath66 being two parameters .",
    "fierz ( 1956 ) realized that with such a lagrangian , atomic spectra will be space - dependent .",
    "but , dirac s idea was revived after teller ( 1948 ) argued that the decrease of @xmath7 contradicts paleontological evidences [ see also pochoda and schwarzschild ( 1964 ) and gamow ( 1967c ) for evidences based on the nuclear resources of the sun ] .",
    "gamow ( 1967a , 1967b ) proposed that @xmath41 might vary as @xmath31 in order to save the , according to him , `` elegant '' idea of dirac ( see also stanyukovich , 1962 ) . in both gamow ( 1967a , 1967b ) and dirac ( 1937 ) theories the ratio @xmath67 decreases as @xmath68 .",
    "teller ( 1948 ) remarked that @xmath69 so that @xmath70 would become the logarithm of a large number .",
    "landau ( 1955 ) , de witt ( 1964 ) and isham _ et al . _",
    "( 1971 ) advocated that such a dependence may arise if the planck length provides a cut - off to the logarithmic divergences of quantum electrodynamics . in this latter class of models",
    "@xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath63 and @xmath42 and @xmath47 remain constant .",
    "dyson ( 1967 ) , peres ( 1967 ) and then davies ( 1972 ) showed , using respectively geological data of the abundance of rhenium and osmium and the stability of heavy nuclei , that these two hypothesis were ruled out observationally ( see section  [ sec_4 ] for details on the experimental results ) .",
    "modern theories of high energy physics offer new arguments to reconsider the variation of the fundamental constants ( see section  [ sec_7 ] ) .",
    "the most important outcome of dirac s proposal and of the following assimilated theories [ among which a later version of dirac ( 1974 ) theory in which there is matter creation either where old matter was present or uniformly throughout the universe ] is that the hypothesis of the constancy of the fundamental constants can and must be checked experimentally .",
    "a way to reconcile some of the large numbers is to consider the energy dependence of the couplings as determined by the renormalization group ( see e.g. itzkyson and zuber , 1980 ) .",
    "for instance , concerning the fine structure constant , the energy - dependence arises from vacuum polarization that tends to screen the charge .",
    "this screening is less important at small distance and the charge appears bigger so that the effective coupling constant grows with energy .",
    "it follows from this approach that the three gauge groups get unified into a larger grand unification group so that the three couplings @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath73 stem from the same dimensionless number @xmath74 .",
    "this might explain some large numbers and answer some of dirac concerns ( hogan , 2000 ) but indeed , it does not explain the weakness of gravity which has become known as the hierarchy problem .",
    "let us come back briefly to the anthropic considerations and show that they allow to set an interval of admissible values for some constants .",
    "indeed , the anthropic principle does not tell whether the constants are varying or not but it gives an insight on how special our universe is .",
    "in such an approach , one studies the effect of small variations of a constant around its observed value and tries to find a phenomenon highly dependent on this constant .",
    "this does not ensure that there is no other set of constants ( very different of the one observed today ) for which an organized universe may exist .",
    "it just tells about the stability in a neighborhood of the location of our universe in the parameter space of physical constants .",
    "rozental ( 1988 ) argued that requiring that the lifetime of the proton @xmath75  yr is larger than the age of the universe @xmath76  s implies that @xmath77 . on the other side ,",
    "if we believe in a grand unified theory , this unification has to take place below the planck scale implying that @xmath78 , this bound depending on assumptions on the particle content . similarly requiring that the electromagnetic repulsion is much smaller than the attraction by strong interaction in nuclei ( which is necessary to have nuclei ) leads to @xmath79 .",
    "the thermonuclear reactions in stars are efficient if @xmath80 and the temperature of a star of radius @xmath81 and mass @xmath82 can roughly be estimated as @xmath83 , which leads to the estimate @xmath84 .",
    "one can indeed think of many other examples to put such bounds . from the previous considerations ,",
    "we retain that the most stringent is @xmath85 it is difficult to believe that these arguments can lead to much sharper constraints .",
    "they are illustrative and give a hint that the constants may not be `` random '' parameters without giving any explanation for their values .",
    "rozental ( 1988 ) also argued that the existence of hydrogen and the formation of complex elements in stars ( mainly the possibility of the reaction @xmath86 ) set constraints on the values of the strong coupling constant .",
    "the production of @xmath87 in stars requires a triple tuning : ( i ) the decay lifetime of @xmath88 , of order @xmath89  s , is four orders of magnitude longer than the time for two @xmath90 particles to scatter , ( ii ) an excited state of the carbon lies just above the energy of @xmath91 and finally ( iii ) the energy level of @xmath92 at 7.1197  mev is non resonant and below the energy of @xmath93 , of order 7.1616  mev , which ensures that most of the carbon synthetized is not destroyed by the capture of an @xmath90-particle ( see livio _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) showed that outside a window of respectively 0.5% and 4% of the values of the strong and electromagnetic forces , the stellar production of carbon or oxygen will be reduced by a factor 30 to 1000 ( see also pochet _ et al _ , 1991 ) .",
    "concerning the gravitational constant , galaxy formation require @xmath94 .",
    "other such constraints on the other parameters listed in the previous section can be obtained .",
    "the introduction of constants in physical law is closely related to the existence of systems of units . for instance , newton s law states that the gravitational force between two masses is proportional to each mass and inversely proportional to their separation . to transform the proportionality to an equality one requires the use of a quantity with dimension of @xmath95 independent of the separation between the two bodies , of their mass , of their composition ( equivalence principle ) and on the position ( local position invariance ) . with an other system of units",
    "this constant could have simply been anything .",
    "the determination of the laboratory value of constants relies mainly on the measurements of lengths , frequencies , times , ...",
    "( see petley , 1985 for a treatise on the measurement of constants and flowers and petley , 2001 , for a recent review ) .",
    "hence , any question on the variation of constants is linked to the definition of the system of units and to the theory of measurement .",
    "the choice of a base units affects the possible time variation of constants .",
    "the behavior of atomic matter is mainly determined by the value of the electron mass and of the fine structure constant . the rydberg energy sets the ( non - relativistic ) atomic levels , the hyperfine structure involves higher powers of the fine structure constant , and molecular modes ( including vibrational , rotational ... modes ) depend on the ratio @xmath54 . as a consequence ,",
    "if the fine structure constant is spacetime dependent , the comparison between several devices such as clocks and rulers will also be spacetime dependent .",
    "this dependence will also differ from one clock to another so that _ metrology becomes both device and spacetime dependent_.    besides this first metrologic problem , the choice of units has implications on the permissible variations of certain dimensionful constant . as an illustration , we follow petley ( 1983 ) who discusses the implication of the definition of the meter . the definition of the meter via a prototype platinum - iridium bar depends on the interatomic spacing in the material used in the construction of the bar .",
    "atkinson ( 1968 ) argued that , at first order , it mainly depends on the bohr radius of the atom so that this definition of the meter fixes the combination ( [ bohr ] ) as constant .",
    "another definition was based on the wavelength of the orange radiation from krypton-86 atoms .",
    "it is likely that this wavelength depends on the rydberg constant and on the reduced mass of the atom so that it ensures that @xmath96 is constant .",
    "the more recent definition of the meter as the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time of @xmath97 of a second imposes the constancy of the speed of light @xmath4 .",
    "identically , the definitions of the second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of cesium-133 or of the kilogram via an international prototype respectively impose that @xmath98 and @xmath99 are fixed .    since the definition of a system of units and the value of the fundamental constants ( and thus the status of their constancy ) are entangled , and since the measurement of any dimensionful quantity is in fact the measurements of a ratio to standards chosen as units , _ it only makes sense to consider the variation of dimensionless ratios_.    in theoretical physics , we often use the fundamental constants as units ( see mcweeny , 1973 for the relation between natural units and si units ) .",
    "the international system of units ( si ) is more appropriate to human size measurements whereas natural systems of units are more appropriate to the physical systems they refer to .",
    "for instance @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 allows to construct the planck mass , time and length which are of great use as units while studying high - energy physics and the same can be done from @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath8 to construct a unit mass ( @xmath1 ) , length ( @xmath100 ) and time ( @xmath101 ) . a physical quantity",
    "can always be decomposed as the product of a label representing a standard quantity of reference and a numerical value representing the number of times the standard has to be taken to build the required quantity .",
    "it follows that a given quantity @xmath102 that can be expressed as @xmath103 with @xmath104 a dimensionless quantity and @xmath105 a function of the base units ( here si ) to some power .",
    "let us decompose @xmath102 as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is another dimensionless constant and @xmath108 a function of a sufficient number of fundamental constants to be consistent with the initial base units .",
    "the time variation of @xmath102 is given by @xmath109 since only @xmath110 or @xmath111 can be measured , it is necessary to have chosen a system of units , the constancy of which is assumed ( i.e. that either @xmath112 or @xmath113 ) to draw any conclusion concerning the time variation of @xmath102 , in the same way as the description of a motion needs to specify a reference frame .    to illustrate the importance of the choice of units and the entanglement between experiment and theory while measuring a fundamental constant ,",
    "let us sketch how one determines @xmath1 in the si system ( following mohr and taylor , 2001 ) , i.e. in kilogram ( see figure  [ figme ] ) .",
    "the kilogram is defined from a platinum - iridium bar to which we have to compare the mass of the electron .",
    "the key to this measurement is to express the electron mass as @xmath114 . from the definition of the second ,",
    "@xmath115 is determined by precision laser - spectroscopy on hydrogen and deuterium and the theoretical expression for the @xmath116-@xmath117 hydrogen transition as @xmath118 $ ] arising from qed .",
    "the fine structure constant is determined by comparing theory and experiment for the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron ( involving again qed ) .",
    "finally , the planck constant is determined by a watt balance comparing a watt electrical power to a watt mechanical power ( involving classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism only : @xmath119 enters through the current and voltage calibration based on two condensed - matter phenomena : josephson and quantum hall effects so that it involves the theories of these two effects ) .    as a conclusion ,",
    "let us recall that ( i ) in general , the values of the constants are not determined by a direct measurement but by a chain involving both theoretical and experimental steps , ( ii ) they depend on our theoretical understanding , ( iii ) the determination of a self - consistent set of values of the fundamental constants results from an adjustment to achieve the best match between theory and a defined set of experiments ( see e.g. , birge , 1929 ) ( iv ) that the system of units plays a crucial role in the measurement chain , since for instance in atomic units , the mass of the electron could have been obtained directly from a mass ratio measurement ( even more precise ! ) and ( v ) fortunately the test of the variability of the constants does not require _ a priori _ to have a high - precision value of the considered constant .    in the following , we will thus focus on the variation of dimensionless ratios which",
    ", for instance , characterize the relative magnitude of two forces , and are independent of the choice of the system of units and of the choice of standard rulers or clocks .",
    "let us note that some ( hopeless ) attempts to constraint the time variation of dimensionful constants have been tried and will be briefly discussed in section  [ sec_5.5 ] .",
    "this does not however mean that a physical theory can not have dimensionful varying constants .",
    "for instance , a theory of varying fine structure constant can be implemented either as a theory with varying electric charge or varying speed of light .      before going into the details of the constraints ,",
    "it is worth taking some time to discuss the kind of experiments or observations that we need to consider and what we can hope to infer from them .",
    "as emphasized in the previous section , we can only measure the variation of dimensionless quantities ( such as the ratio of two wavelengths , two decay rates , two cross sections ... ) and the idea is to pick up a physical system which depends strongly on the value of a set of constants so that a small variation will have dramatic effects .",
    "the general strategy is thus to constrain the spacetime variation of an observable quantity as precisely as possible and then to relate it to a set of fundamental constants .",
    "basically , we can split all the methods into three classes : ( i ) _ atomic methods _ including atomic clocks , quasar absorption spectra and observation of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) where one compares ratios of atomic transition frequencies .",
    "the cmb observation depends on the dependence of the recombination process on @xmath41 ; ( ii ) _ nuclear methods _ including nucleosynthesis , @xmath90- and @xmath120-decay , oklo reactor for which the observables are respectively abundances , lifetimes and cross sections ; and ( iii ) _ gravitational methods _ including the test of the violation of the universality of free fall where one constrains the relative acceleration of two bodies , stellar evolution ",
    "these methods are either _ experimental _ ( e.g. atomic clocks ) for which one can have a better control of the systematics , _ observational _ ( e.g. geochemical , astrophysical and cosmological observations ) or _ mixed _ ( @xmath90- and @xmath120-decay , universality of free fall ) .",
    "this sets the time scales on which a possible variation can be measured .",
    "for instance , in the case of the fine structure constant ( see section  [ sec_4 ] ) , one expects to be able to constrain a relative variation of @xmath41 of order @xmath121 [ geochemical ( oklo ) ] , @xmath122 [ astrophysical ( quasars ) ] , @xmath123 [ cosmological methods ] , @xmath124 [ laboratory methods ] respectively on time scales of order @xmath125  yr , @xmath126  yr , @xmath127  yr and @xmath128 months .",
    "this brings up the question of the comparison and of the compatibility of the different measurements since one will have to take into account e.g. the rate of change of @xmath41 which is often assumed to be constant . in general , this requires to specify a model both to determine the law of evolution and the links between the constants .",

    "this led the codata in 1998 to raise the relative uncertainty for @xmath7 from 0.013% to 0.15% ( gundlach and merkowitz , 2000 ) .",
    "dicke ( 1964 ) stressed that the earth is such a complex system that it would be difficult to use it as a source of evidence for or against the existence of a time variation of the gravitational constant .",
    "he noted that among the direct effects , a weakening of the gravitational constant induces a variation of the earth surface temperature , an expansion of the earth radius and a variation of the length of the day ( jordan , 1955 , and then murphy and dicke , 1964 ; hoyle , 1972 ) .      teller ( 1948 ) first emphasized that dirac hypothesis may be in conflict with paleontological evidence .",

    "this was in contradiction with the existence of trilobites in the cambrian .",
    "teller ( 1948 ) used a too low value for the age of the universe .",

    "damour and pichon ( 1999 ) extended these investigations by considering a two - parameter family of scalar - tensor theories of gravitation involving a non - linear scalar field - matter coupling function .",
    "they concluded that even in the cases where before bbn the scalar - tensor theory was far from general relativity , bbn enables to set quite small constraints on the observable deviations from general relativity today .",
    "let us also note the work by carroll and kaplinghat ( 2001 ) in which they tried to constrain the expansion history of our universe in a model - independent way during nucleosynthesis .",

    "first , in kaluza - klein or string inspired models , all constants are varying due either to the dilaton or the extra - dimensions ( see section  [ sec_7 ] for details ) .",
    "another argument lies in the fact that if we believe in grand unified theories , there exists an energy scale @xmath864 at which all the ( non - gravitational ) couplings unify , @xmath865 the value of the coupling constants at any energy scale smaller than @xmath864 is obtained from the renormalization group equations .",
    "it follows that a time variation of @xmath41 induces a time variation of @xmath74 and thus of @xmath42 and @xmath73 .",
    "in such a framework , the varying parameters would then be @xmath866 , @xmath867 and the yukawa couplings .    the strong coupling at an energy scale @xmath868 is related to the qcd scale @xmath133 by @xmath869 with @xmath870 , @xmath871 being the number of quark flavors .",

    ", the proton mass is proportional to the qcd energy scale , @xmath873 , so that a change in @xmath73 ( or in @xmath74 ) induces a change in @xmath129 and we have @xmath874 the energy - scale evolution of the three coupling constants in a 1-loop approximation takes the form @xmath875 where the numerical coefficients depend on the choice of the considered gauge group .",

    "calmet and fritzsch ( 2001 ) computed low energy effects of a time varying fine structure constant within a gut - like theory with a constraint of the form ( [ gut ] ) and focus their analysis on the nucleon mass .",
    "nevertheless , they assumed that the mechanisms of electroweak and supersymmetry breaking as well as fermion mass generation were left unchanged and thus that quarks , leptons , w and z masses do not vary .",
    "but , as seen from eqs ( [ weak1]-[weak2 ] ) below , one can not vary @xmath18 with @xmath880 being fixed without varying the higgs vacuum expectation value which induces a variation of the mass of the fermions .",

    "they concluded that the most `` interesting '' situation , in view of the variation of @xmath41 and @xmath129 , is the second case .",

    "they concluded that @xmath883 ( with a precision of about 20% on the numerical factor ) and that a variation of the fine structure of the magnitude of the one observed by webb _ et al . _",

    "since we do not have the theories of electroweak and supersymmetry breaking as well as the ones for the generation of fermion masses , the correlations between different low - energy observables remain model - dependent .",

    "there are many different candidates to account for this exotic type of matter .",
    "the most simple solution would be a cosmological constant ( for which @xmath1019 ) but one will then have to face the well known _ cosmological constant problem _",

    "another way is to argue that there exists a ( yet unknown ) mechanism which makes the cosmological constant strictly vanish and to find another matter candidate ( referred to as `` dark energy '' ) able to explain the cosmological observations .    among all the proposals ( see e.g. bintruy 2000 and carroll , 2000 for a review ) quintessence seems to be a promising mechanism . in these models",
    ", a scalar field is rolling down a runaway potential decreasing to zero at infinity hence acting as a fluid with an effective equation of state in the range @xmath1020 if the field is minimally coupled .",
    "runaway potentials such as exponential potential and inverse power law potentials @xmath1021 with @xmath1022 and @xmath759 a mass scale , arise in models where supersymmetry is dynamically broken ( bintruy , 1999 ) and in which flat directions are lifted by non - perturbative effects .",
    "one of the underlying motivation to replace the cosmological constant by a scalar field comes from superstring models in which any dimensionful parameter is expressed in terms of the string mass scale and the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field .",
    "however , the requirement of slow roll ( mandatory to have a negative pressure ) and the fact that the quintessence field dominates today imply , if the minimum of the potential is zero , that ( i ) it is very light , roughly of order @xmath1023 ( carroll , 1998 ) and that ( ii ) the vacuum expectation value of the quintessence field today is of order of the planck mass .",
    "it follows that coupling of this quintessence field leads to observable long - range forces and time dependence of the constant of nature .",

    "riazuelo and uzan ( 2002 ) derived the modified magnitude - redshift relation to include the effect of the variation of @xmath7 , using a one - zone analytical model for the supernovae and was confirmed by numerical simulations ( gaztaaga _ et al .",

    "barrow and magueijo ( 2001 ) considered the effect of a time dependent fine structure constant on the interpretation of the supernovae data .",

    "but , only the effect on the hubble diagram was studied and the influence of the change of the fine structure constant on the thermonuclear burst of the supernovae , and hence on its light curve , was not considered at all .    up to now there is no observational evidence of a time variation of the cosmological constant .",
    "the measurement of the equation of state of the dark energy can be hoped to be possible very soon , the best candidate method being the use of large - scale structure growth and weak gravitational lensing ( benabed and bernardeau , 2001 ) .",

    "brane models allowing for the scalar field in the bulk naturally predicts a time variable gravitational constant ( see e.g. brax and davis , 2001 ) .",
    "the question of the compatibility between an observed variation of the fine structure constant and particle physics models was put forward by banks _",
    "as seen above , in the low energy limit , the change of the fine structure constant can be implemented by coupling a scalar field to the photon kinetic term @xmath1240 , but this implies that the vacuum energy computed in this low energy limit must depend on @xmath41 . estimating that @xmath1241 leads to a variation of order @xmath1242 for a variation @xmath1243 and for @xmath1244 .",
    "indeed , this contrasts with the average energy density of the universe of about @xmath1245 during the matter era so that the universe was dominated by the cosmological constant at @xmath1246 , which is at odds with observations .",
    "it was thus concluded that this imposes that @xmath1247 contrary to the standard cosmological constant problem , the vacuum zero - point energy to be removed is time - dependent and one can only remove it for a fixed value of @xmath41 . whereas the cosmological constant problem involves the fine tuning of a parameter ,",
    "this now implies the fine tuning of a function !",
    "it follows that a varying @xmath41 can not be naturally explained in a field theory approach .",
    "a possible way out would be to consider that the field is in fact an axion ( see carroll , 1998 ; choi , 2000 ; banks and dine , 2001 ) .",
    "some possible links with heisenberg relations and quantum mechanics were also investigated by raada ( 2002 ) .",
    "besides , the resolution of the cosmological constant problem may also provide the missing elements to understand the variation of the constants .",
    "both preoblems can be hoped to be solved by string theory .",
    "the experimental and observational constraints on the variation of the fine structure , gravitational constants , of the electron to proton mass ration and different combinations of the proton gyromagnetic factor and the two previous constants , as well as bounds on @xmath42 are summarized in tables [ table_3 ] , [ table_1 ] and [ table_4 ] .    the developments of high energy physics theories such as multi - dimensional and string theories provide new motivations to consider the time variation of the fundamental constants .",
    "the observation of the variability of these constants constitutes one of the very few hope to test directly the existence of extra - dimensions and to test these high energy - physics models . in the long run",
    ", it may help to discriminate between different effective potentials for the dilaton and/or the dynamics of the internal space .",
    "but indeed , independently of these motivations , the understanding of the value of the fundamental constants of nature and the discussion of their status of constant remains a central question of physics in general : questioning the free parameters of a theory accounts to question the theory itself .",
    "it is a basic and direct test of the law of gravity .    as we have shown , proving that a fundamental constant has changed is not an obvious task mainly because observations usually entangle a set of constants and because the bounds presented in the literature often assume the constancy of a set of parameters .",
    "but , in gut , kaluza - klein and string inspired models , one expects all the couplings to vary simultaneously .",
    "better analysis of the degeneracies as started by sisterna and vucetich ( 1990 , 1991 ) ( see also landau and vucetich , 2002 ) are really needed before drawing definitive conclusions but such analysis are also dependent in the progresses in our understanding of the fundamental interactions and particularly of the qcd theory and on the generation of the fermion masses .",
    "other progresses require ( model - dependent ) investigations of the compatibility of the different bounds .",
    "it has also to be remembered that arguing about the non - existence of something to set constraints ( e.g. broulik and trefil , 1971 ) is very dangerous . on an observational point of view",
    ", one needs to further study the systematics ( and remember some erroneous claims such as those by van flandern , 1975 ) and to propose new experiments ( see e.g. karshenboim , 2000 , 2001 who proposed experiments based on the hyperfine structure of deuterium an ytterbium-171 as well as atoms with magnetic moment ; braxmaier _ et al . _ , 2001 ; torgerson , 2000 who proposed to compare optical frequency references ; sortais _ et al . _ , 2001 who improved the sensitivity of frequency standards , the coming satellite experiments aces , microscope and step  ) . on local scales ,",
    "the test of the universality of free fall sets drastic constraints and one can hope to use similar methods on cosmological scales from the measurements of weak gravitational lensing ( uzan and bernardeau , 2001 ) or from structure formation ( martins _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) .",
    "the complementarity between local experiments and geo - astrophysical observations is necessary since these methods test different time - scales and are mainly sensitive either to rapid oscillations or a slow drift of the constants .",
    "the recent astrophysical observations of quasars tend to show that both the fine structure constant and the electron to proton mass ratio have evolved .",
    "these two measurements are non - zero detections and thus very different in consequences compared with other bounds .",
    "they draw the questions of their compatibility with the bounds obtained from other physical systems such as e.g. the test of the universality of free fall and oklo but also on a more theoretical aspect of the understanding of such a late time variation which does not seem to be natural from a field theory point of view .",
    "theoretically , one expects _ all _ constants to vary and the level of their variation is also worth investigating .",
    "one would need to study the implication of these measurements for the other experiments and try to determine their expected level of detection .",
    "both results arise from the observation of quasar absorption spectra ; it is of importance to ensure that all systematics are taken into account and are confirmed by independent teams , using e.g. the vlt which offers a better signal to noise and spectral resolution .",
    "the step from the standard model+general relativity to string theory allows for dynamical constants and thus starts to address the question of why the constants have the value they have .",
    "unfortunately , no complete and satisfactory stabilization mechanism is known yet and we have to understand why , if confirmed , the constants are still varying and whether such a variation induces a new cosmological constant problem .",
    "the study of the variation of the constants offers a new link between astrophysics , cosmology and high - energy physics complementary to primordial cosmology .",
    "it is deeply related to the test of the law of gravitation , both of the deviations from general relativity and the violation of the weak equivalence principle .",
