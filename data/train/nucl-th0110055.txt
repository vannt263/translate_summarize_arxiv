    "the t - matrix for compton scattering off a free proton , @xmath158 , is calculated in a k - matrix model very similar to that of ref .",
    "this covariant coupled - channels calculation of pion scattering , pion photoproduction and compton scattering on the nucleon , satisfies unitarity constraints below the two - pion production threshold and is gauge invariant . in the calculation of @xmath158 the @xmath0",
    "is treated as a genuine spin-3/2 resonance @xcite in order to be compatible with the present treatment of the in - medium @xmath0  resonance .",
    "the change in the structure of the @xmath159 and @xmath160 vertices ( the disappearance of the spin-1/2 off - shell couplings ) necessitated modification of parameters of the @xmath17 and @xmath92 exchanges in the t - channel .",

    "@xcite could be obtained . in   the results for compton scattering",
    "are compared to data . at the pion - production threshold , e@xmath161mev , the calculation overestimates the data which might be related to ignoring in the k - matrix calculation the real pion - loop contributions which are responsible for the cusp structure in the @xmath162 compton multipole  @xcite .",
    "the dressed @xmath0 contribution @xmath163 is based on a calculation in which only the s - type tree - level contribution is taken into account using the medium - modified @xmath0 propagator as defined in sect.ii ( see ) .",
    "note that in the impulse approximation the photon is absorbed on a free nucleon and thus one has to work with the free nucleon mass @xmath102 instead of the medium - modified one @xmath164 .",
    "the @xmath0 self - energy parameters will depend on the difference between the @xmath0 invariant mass and the nucleon mass ( @xmath165 ) and are therefore evaluated at @xmath166 .",
    "the subtracted @xmath0 contribution @xmath167 in vacuum is obtained from a similar calculation using the free propagator instead .    in the limit of low photon energies",
    "the cross section for compton scattering is given by the thomson limit , where the matrix element is proportional to @xmath168 . in the present calculation only the contribution to compton scattering proportional to @xmath169 , the total number of protons , is taken into account , thus the contribution proportional to @xmath170 is omitted .",
    "as such the thomson limit is violated since @xmath171 . the neglected contribution is thought to arise from intermediate excitations to collective giant dipole resonance states and be related to the finite extent of the nuclear system@xcite . for this reason one expects this contribution to be vanishingly small at forward angles . at backward angles , where the one - proton cross section is suppressed by the formfactor due to the large momentum transfer",
    ", the two - body mechanism may give a significant contribution .",
    "in our approach the equivalent contribution would arise from two - body contributions to the electromagnetic current arising from the nucleon - nucleon interaction . as argued ,",
    "such a contribution is of marginal importance at forward angles but large at backward angles . in a future work",
    "this will be included explicitly , presently we have ignored these two - body currents .",
    "cross sections have been calculated for @xmath5he and @xmath6c at several densities to investigate medium effects . to compare with data",
    "an average over density ( @xmath172 ) , based on the local density approximation ( lda ) , has been performed . the density profile ( @xmath172 )",
    "was taken consistently with the formfactor in .    in",
    "we have plotted , for various nuclear densities , the cross section and photon asymmetry for compton scattering on @xmath5he in mean - field model i , both at fixed lab angle @xmath173 and lab energy @xmath174 mev .",
    "the results show a strong density dependence . in order to obtain more insight",
    "we have plotted in the upper panels of   the values of the 3-momentum @xmath41 and ( kinematical ) invariant mass @xmath66 of the @xmath175 as enter in the calculations presented in  . in the lower panels we show the real and imaginary part of the @xmath0 self - energy .",
    "we concentrate on the dominant imaginary part , as this seems sufficient to explain the global density dependence of the cross section . at fixed @xmath176 mev by far",
    "the largest contribution to the imaginary part is due to the spreading width .",
    "the decay width in this energy regime vanishes for the larger densities and is very small for the lowest densities .",
    "the width therefore almost vanishes at zero density . at fixed @xmath177 and with increasing energy",
    "the pauli - corrected decay width becomes more important , showing up in the @xmath0 width at small density and in the global increase with energy starting at 300 mev .",
    "much of the density dependence of the cross sections in   can be understood from the density dependence of the imaginary part of the @xmath0 self - energy . at a photon energy of 206 mev one",
    "is relatively far from the peak of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "an increase in the width of the resonance therefore results in an increase of the cross section at this energy .",
    "the opposite happens when one approaches the peak of the resonance , where the cross section decreases with density .",
    "the data show clear evidence that this is indeed the correct mechanism , at 206 mev the vacuum calculation falls below the data while the lda result shows a good correspondence with the data at forward angles . near the resonance",
    "the vacuum calculation overestimates the data by a factor 2 while the lda result gives a much better prediction or even lies below .",
    "the sharp fall - off of the cross section with angle is mostly due to the formfactor which falls off strongly with increasing momentum transfer .    at backward angles the cross section",
    "is not reproduced , which is probably due to the double - scattering contribution which is missing from the present calculations .",
    "the photon asymmetry at 206 mev shows only a minor density dependence as compared to the error bars on the data .",
    "in   we compare the @xmath178he cross section and asymmetry with lda calculations for the fermi - gas and mean - field calculations i and ii .",
    "the fermi - gas calculation undershoots the data at small angles for @xmath174 mev and at large energies for @xmath173 , and deviates from the asymmetry data points .",
    "the mean field calculations tend to improve this .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath6c is shown in  . because of the larger radius of @xmath6c the cross section falls off faster with angle than that for @xmath5he .",
    "the drop in the cross section at energies beyond 250 mev is partly due to an increased width of the @xmath0 resonance and partly due to the formfactor cutting the cross section at larger momentum transfers .",
    "this effect is also seen in the data .",
    "in this paper we have presented a calculation of the cross section for compton scattering on @xmath178he and @xmath6c in a k - matrix model where the amplitudes are calculated in the impulse approximation .",
    "fermi - motion is incorporated using the factorization approximation scheme .",
    "the medium effects are included by replacing the free @xmath0 propagator by a medium - modified @xmath0 propagator in the s - type resonant tree - level diagram .",
    "the medium - properties of the @xmath0 resonance are investigated in a relativistic framework for symmetrical nuclear matter .",
    "this involves the calculation of the @xmath0 self - energy which was performed in a fermi - gas model and two mean - field models .",
    "the imaginary part includes the pauli - corrected decay width and the spreading width incorporating ph - excitations ; the real part was calculated using dispersion integrals . in both the fermi - gas and mean - field calculations",
    "the width is increased as compared to the free @xmath0 width .",
    "this increase tends to be stronger for the fermi - gas model than for the mean - field models .",
    "the differential compton scattering cross section shows a strong density dependence . within a local density approximation , the density dependence of the @xmath0 propagator results in a much better description of the data , as compared to a calculation using the vacuum @xmath0 propagator .",
    "mean - field models which incorporate a reduced effective mass of the nucleon and @xmath0 tend to improve on the results in a fermi - gas calculation .",
    "both mean - field results are quite close indicating that the cross section is not that sensitive to the used effective masses .",
    "the present one - body mechanism is unable to describe the data at backward angles . in order to improve this ,",
    "it is imperative that multiple scattering should be incorporated in the model .",
