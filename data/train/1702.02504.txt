    "the blazar class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) includes bl lacertae objects ( bl lacs ) and high polarization quasars ( hpqs , which are a subset of flat spectrum radio quasars , fsrqs , characterized by high fractional optical polarization degree @xmath2 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for these",
    ", the total radiative energy output is dominated by the broad - band , non - thermal emission produced in relativistic jets .",
    "these jets are launched by supermassive black holes surrounded by magnetized accretion disks , that are located at the centers of ( usually ) massive elliptical galaxies , and when pointing close to our line of sight the emission is substantially doppler boosted @xcite .",
    "the radio - to - optical / x - ray segment of the blazar emission continuum is due to the synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic leptons ( hereafter `` electrons '' , for simplicity ) , while the high - frequency x - ray - to-@xmath0-ray segment is most widely believed to be due to the inverse - comptonization of various circumnuclear photon fields ( produced both internally and externally to the outflow ) by the jet electrons .",
    "blazars display a strong variability from radio to @xmath0-rays on timescales ranging from decades down to hours , or even minutes . the observed flux changes are often classified broadly into the three major types , namely a ` long - term variability ' ( ltv , with the corresponding timescales of decades - to - months ) , a ` short - term variability ' ( stv ; weeks - to - days ) , and an intra - night / day variability . rapid ",
    "hour- and minute - long  blazar flares are especially pronounced at higher energies , particularly in the @xmath0-ray regime , with intensity changes of up to even a few magnitudes @xcite .",
    "the origin of such dramatic behavior , and in particular its relation to the similarly rapid but smaller - amplitude ` microvariability ' observed at lower wavelengths , ( including inv in the optical range ) , is still being widely debated .",
    "several competing scenarios have been proposed to explain the rapid variability of blazar sources .",
    "some include _ extrinsic causes _ , such as gravitational lensing ( where the observed flux changes are attributed to a lensing of light rays by a foreground compact object ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or , in the radio domain , interstellar scintillation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "others involve _ an intrinsic origin _ , including some that are purely geometrical in nature , such as ` the lighthouse effect ' , where the precession of a jet results in the differential forward beaming of the emission .",
    "a set of promising intrinsic origin models , which may be favored because of polarimetric measurements revealing the accompanying changes in the fractional polarization and polarization angle , involves various plasma instabilities leading to the formation of shocks and turbulence in the outflow , which then heat and accelerate the jet particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "other intrinsic models invoke the annihilation of magnetic field lines of opposite polarity , transferring the energy from the field to particles at the reconnection sites and during the subsequent evolution of the reconnected magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at optical frequencies ,",
    "the ltv of non - blazar agn , including radio - quiet quasars ( rqqs ) , radio - intermediate quasars ( riqs ) , lobe - dominated radio - loud quasars ( ldqs ) , and low - polarization flat spectrum radio quasars ( lpqs ) , is characterized by much smoother , yet comparable in amplitude , intensity changes to those observed in blazar sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this finding is surprising , keeping in mind that the bulk of the optical emission of these non - blazar type active galaxies is understood to originate in accretion disks , rather than relativistic jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , a clear dichotomy exists on intra - night timescales , where the blazar class shows a considerably higher optical inv in both amplitude , @xmath3 ( see equation [ eq : psi ] below ) , and duty cycle , dc ( equation [ eq : dc ] ) , than non - blazar objects .",
    "more recently , based on a systematic study using 262 intra - night light curves , each monitored for a duration of @xmath4 4 hr , it was shown that the optical inv duty cycle is dc@xmath5 for the blazar class , while it is @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 for the rqqs , riqs , ldqs , and lpqs , respectively , at least whenever clear inv amplitudes of @xmath10 are considered @xcite .",
    "even though the physical processes giving rise to the flaring emission of blazars remain debatable , considerable progress has been made in characterizing the statistical properties of blazar variability at different wavelengths , and in different time domains .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated repeatedly that the power spectral density ( psd ) of blazar light curves is , in general , of a power - law form . a physical process with such a variability power spectrum , denoted hereafter as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the temporal frequency ( corresponding to the timescale @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the normalization constant , and @xmath15 is the spectral slope , is called white noise when @xmath16 , flicker ( pink ) noise when @xmath17 , and brownian ( red ) noise when @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the psd integrated over some variability frequency range is then a measure of the variance of the underlying signal in the time series within the corresponding range of variability timescales .",
    "breaks in the slope or in the normalization of a psd may appear , signaling characteristic / critical variability timescales in the system .",
    "in the case of blazars , various segments of radio , optical , x - ray , and @xmath0-ray power spectra within the variability time domains from years to days ( and in some instances , even sub - hour timescales ) , are characterized by spectral slopes @xmath19 , meaning that the variability amplitude increases with increasing variability timescale .",
    "rarely , however , have blazar psds been analyzed in a systematic way at different wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum and over a truly broad range of temporal frequencies .",
    "it is important to note that colored noise - type power spectra are expected to flatten on longer variability timescales ( to preserve the total finite variance ) , and to cut - off at frequencies corresponding to the shortest variability timescale in a system .",
    "the detection of such cutoffs in blazar periodograms would be of a primary importance for constraining the physics of blazar jets ; however , such detections may be hampered by the finite duration of available monitoring blazar data , on the one hand , and statistical fluctuations resulting from the measurement errors , on the other hand .    in this work",
    ", we present our analysis and interpretation of the multi - wavelength ( radio , optical , and high - energy @xmath0-ray ) , and particularly long - span ( decades to minutes ) variability power spectrum of the bl lac object pks0735@xmath20178 .",
    "this source is singled out from the blazar class by its persistently weak intra - night optical variability : using 17 nights data spanning over 11 years of optical monitoring of this blazar , @xcite estimated the inv dc as @xmath21 for @xmath22 . note that while such a low duty cycle is not unusual for non - blazar agn ( see above ) , it is surprising for highly polarized blazars such as pks0735@xmath20178 . in this study , we present the results of our extended intra - night monitoring programme of the source , now consisting a total of 25 nights and spanning over 18yr of observations ( 19982015 ) .",

    "it consists of independently distributed @xmath27 variables with two dof .",
    "this means that the dispersion in each estimate around the true value equals the true value itself , providing a noisy estimate of the spectral power @xcite . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we have also constructed ` binned ' logarithmic periodograms , following the procedure outlined in @xcite , , and @xcite .",
    "we binned our periodograms with a constant factor of 1.6 in frequency ( and by a factor of 1.5 , in case of periodograms derived for the long - term optical light curve ) and evaluated the mean power at the representative frequency taken as the geometric mean of each bin .",
    "the derived periodogram displays constant variance around the true underlying power spectrum , as if we are observing a noise process following the @xmath27 distribution with two dof . for the binned logarithmic",

    "furthermore , the true power spectrum is related to the observed power spectrum as @xmath30 . in order to derive the psd slope we fit the power law function using a least - squares fit method in log - log space . since the scatter is multiplicative in the linear space , it is additive in log - log space and identical at each frequency , so @xmath31 = \\log [ ( p_{true}({\\nu_k } ) ] + \\log [ \\frac{\\chi^2}{2 } ] .",

    "this range , from , @xmath38hz , is primarily due to the high photometric accuracy achieved in our intra - night monitoring program . in all the cases , however , the normalization of intra - night psds turns out to be consistent with a simple extrapolation of the red - noise ( @xmath39 ) optical psd from lower temporal frequencies .",
    "figure[fig : psd_mf ] presents the composite multi - wavelength psds of pks0735 + 178 corresponding to the variability timescales @xmath40days .",
    "this explicitly shows the similarities between the radio and optical bands and the clear difference of the @xmath0-ray band from the others for which we have enough data to compute sensible psds .",
    "the main findings from our analysis of the multi - wavelength , multi - epoch , photo - polarimetric data for pks0735 + 178 , can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the inv duty cycle of pks0735@xmath20178 in the extended dataset consisting of 25 nights ( 22 from our monitoring program and three from the literature ; figure  [ fig : inv ] ) , over the time span of 18 years , is dc@xmath41 for all the variability amplitudes @xmath3 , but dc@xmath42 when only the nights showing @xmath22 are considered .",
    "this value of inv dc is @xmath43 5 10 times smaller than that typically observed in blazar sources , indicating that pks0735@xmath20178 remains in a state of optical quiescence on intra - night timescales , in conformity with our previous study @xcite .",
    "the newly obtained long - term _ fermi_-lat and optical data reveal weakly - correlated , a - factor - of - a - few , flux changes in the source on month - like timescales ( figure  [ fig : zlc ] ) ; meanwhile , the archival radio and optical data show uncorrelated , larger - amplitude ( factor of several ) variability over the timescale of years ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the gathered photo - polarimetric data reveal large variations in the optical pa , traced during the period 20052015 on timescale of months to years ; those changes seem erratic , with no clear repetitive pattern and no correlation with either the total optical flux , the optical pd , or even with the overall level of the optical polarization degree ( @xmath44 ; figure  [ fig : zlc ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the optical pd of this blazar has frequently been found to be below 3% .",
    "4 .    the psds of pks0735@xmath20178 at radio ( ghz ) and optical frequencies , on the timescales from years to weeks , resemble each other closely : both can be well represented by a single power - law function with the slope @xmath45 , meaning a `` pure red noise '' type of the source variability at the lower frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum . on the other hand , the high - energy @xmath0-ray psd , within the corresponding temporal frequency range , is best fitted with a much flatter slope of @xmath46 , corresponding to a `` pink noise '' behavior ( figure[fig : psd_mf ] ) ; no low - frequency flattenings in the psds have been detected .",
    "the optical psds on intra - night timescales ( for the nights during which inv has been detected ) , are characterized by a range of slopes mostly between 1.5 and 3.3 with the exception of one instance where it was @xmath434 ( however , this was from a shorter observation with relatively long integration times so that it was derived using only 3 points in the binned periodogram ) .",
    "this implies a non - stationarity of the variability process in the source , at least on hourly timescales ; in all the cases , however , the normalized intra - night psds , is consistent with a simple extrapolation from the red - noise ( @xmath39 ) optical psd observed on longer timescales ( figure  [ fig : optical ] , table  [ tab : psd ] ) .",
    "no high - frequencycut - offs have been detected in the intra - night power spectra down to the noise floor levels .",
    "the very low inv dc of pks0735 + 178 reported previously in the literature @xcite was puzzling , in view of the persistently high optical polarization degree claimed for the source @xcite .",
    "our extended monitoring has confirmed the low inv dc but , at the same time , revealed that the @xmath47 of the blazar frequently drops below @xmath48  for about one - third of the monitoring time , based on the available optical polarimetry .",
    "traditionally , the degree of optical polarization has been used to differentiate between blazars and lpqs . in blazar sources , states with very high @xmath49 reaching even @xmath50 ,",
    "are not uncommon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating highly ordered magnetic fields within the jet regions where the observed optical synchrotron emission is being produced ; in the case of lpqs , on the other hand , the optical polarization is presumed to be reduced predominantly through the more significant contribution of ( unpolarized ) thermal emission from an accretion disk to the radiative output of a source at optical wavelengths . yet ,",
    "pks0735 + 178 is a typical example of a bl lac object lacking any strong emission lines , while those would be expected to be visible in the presence of pronounced disk continuum emission .",
    "although some blazars are known to alter between the `` blazar - like '' and the `` lpq - like '' optical polarization levels , the frequency of such transitions is poorly known , presumably due to the lack of regular polarimetric observations .",
    "only a few of the brightest sources have been subjected to long - term optical photo - polarimetric monitoring .",
    "for example , the bl lac object oj287 during the period 20052009 , displayed @xmath51 for only @xmath52 of the total observed time span @xcite .",
    "hence , one may conclude that pks0735@xmath20178 is a peculiar blazar in showing _ both _ a relatively low microvariability duty cycle , _ and _ frequent states of low optical polarization .    based on a comparative study of quasars of the hpq and lpq types ,",
    "concluded that the pronounced and frequent inv is correlated with the overall high degree of the optical polarization , rather than with the degree of relativistic beaming , which seems to play a secondary role .",
    "specifically , blazars and quasars with similar degrees of relativistic beaming ( i.e. , with a similar radio core prominence ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) , exhibit considerably and systematically different inv dcs .",
    "this is in agreement with our new results summarized above for pks0735@xmath20178 , suggesting a basic link between the magnetic field ordering in the jet , as reflected in the optical polarization degree , and the production of rapid flux changes .",
    "we finally note in this context that the vlbi radio jets of hpqs show @xmath53 of the core / inner jet region parallel to the jet direction , and typically well aligned with @xmath54 , while the vlbi radio jets of lpqs are characterized by @xmath53 misaligned with respect to the jet axis , and uncorrelated with @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "for pks0735@xmath20178 , we observe erratic changes of @xmath54 between 0 and 180deg , uncorrelated with @xmath55 and with no special relation to the vlbi jet direction in the source .",
    "such a behavior is hard to reconcile with a `` grand design '' helical magnetic field structure inferred for the source by @xcite and .",
    "the lt radio psds of blazar sources analyzed in the literature within the temporal frequency range @xmath56hz , are best represented by single power - laws with slopes @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "specifically , the psd of the bl lac object pks2155@xmath58304 , while consistent with a power - law function @xmath59 , shows a flattening at frequencies below @xmath60d@xmath61 , suggesting a transition from a red noise to a white noise type of variability on the timescale of a few years . for pks0735@xmath20178 , analyzed the long - term optical monitoring data ( 19702004 ) using the structure function method and found the associated psd slope @xmath15 to be between 1.5 and 2.0 on the timescales ranging from 33 years down to weeks ; at the same time , they found a variety of psd slopes , @xmath62 , for densely - sampled light curves from separate observing seasons ( covering the timescales of a few months to a few days ) .",
    "also , the optical psds of blazars detected with the kepler telescope are characterized by @xmath63 within the temporal frequency range @xmath64 hz @xcite .",
    "the x - ray psds of bl lacs , on the other hand , are typically consistent with a broken power - law model with the slopes @xmath65 above the break frequency @xmath66d@xmath61 , and @xmath67 below the break .",
    "unfortunately , pks0735@xmath20178 is quite weak in x - rays , so very few observations of it have been made and it is not possible to compute a sensible x - ray psd for it .",
    "the _ fermi_-lat psd slopes for the bright bl lacs and fsrqs , have been estimated by @xcite as @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , for temporal frequencies from @xmath70 to @xmath71hz ( see also in this context * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , who modeled in detail the 4yr - long _ fermi_-lat light curves of the brightest blazar sources down to week - long sampling intervals , claimed the corresponding psd slopes to be typically @xmath72 , in a very good agreement with our result for pks0735@xmath20178 .",
    "rather limited work has been carried out to compare the psd properties at different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum for a given blazar source .",
    "most notably , @xcite , by comparing the lt psd of the luminous fsrq 3c279 at x - ray ( 320kev ) , optical ( r - band ) , and radio ( ghz ) frequencies , covering the total time span of @xmath73 years ( temporal frequencies from @xmath74hz down to @xmath75hz ) , demonstrated that each psd can be well fitted by a single power - law with @xmath76 ( x - rays ) , @xmath77 ( optical ) , and @xmath78 ( radio ) .",
    "a more extensive study by @xcite , consisting of six blazars observed with _ fermi_-lat and optical / near infra - red telescopes , albeit only for a total duration @xmath66 year ( temporal frequency range @xmath79hz ) , revealed that , on average , the blazar psds at different frequencies are roughly consistent with @xmath80 .",
    "only a few blazar studies have addressed the issue of the psd characteristics on intra - night timescales . estimated the optical psd slopes for bl lacertae to be @xmath81 on five observing nights within the frequency range @xmath82hz . in the case of a highly variable bl lac object 0716 + 714",
    ", @xcite noted rather flat optical psd slopes with @xmath83 on 10 monitoring nights for the frequency range @xmath84hz ; meanwhile , @xcite estimated @xmath65 on five nights and within the same temporal frequency range .",
    "the wide range of psd slopes cited above on intra - night timescales for 0716@xmath20716 , implies either some significant inconsistency between the different analysis methods applied , or the non - stationarity of blazar variability on hourly timescales .",
    "the latter case echoes our results for pks 0735@xmath20178 .    finally , in the very high energy @xmath0-ray domain , @xcite reported the psd slope of @xmath39 for @xmath85hz during the famous tev outburst of pks2155@xmath58304 .",
    "the psd slopes derived from our detailed analysis of the lt high energy @xmath0-ray ( 0.1200gev ) , optical ( r - band ) , and radio ( ghz frequencies ) data on pks0735@xmath20178 , on the timescales ranging from years to weeks / days , suggest that the statistical character of the @xmath0-ray flux changes is different from that of the radio and optical flux changes : there is increasingly more variability power in @xmath0-ray fluctuations on comparable temporal frequencies when going to shorter and shorter variability timescales ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : psd_mf ] ) .",
    "our finding is in agreement with the _",
    "fermi_-lat blazar data analysis presented by @xcite .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising since , at least within the framework of the standard one - zone leptonic models for the broad - band blazar emission , which is supported to some extent by the multi - wavelength correlations sometimes observed , the power spectrum of the synchrotron emission component ( radio and optical photon energies ) should be the same as , or eventually flatter than , the power spectrum of the inverse - compton component @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , a broken power - law form of the psd with flat low - frequency segment @xmath86 and the high - frequency slope @xmath18 , lacking any peaks indicative of a ( quasi-)periodicity , can be understood in terms of a source variability being driven by an underlying stochastic process . in particular",
    ", @xcite proposed that such a variability can be modelled as a first - order autoregressive process ( gaussian ornstein - uhlenbeck process ; ou for short ) , in which the source emissivity responds to some input noise ( gaussian white noise , by assumption ) , with a given relaxation timescale @xmath87 .",
    "for such a situation , the source variability at temporal frequencies above the break @xmath88 is of the red noise type , and below the break , of the white noise type .",
    "@xcite discussed a more complex case of a linear superposition of ou processes with two very different relaxation timescales , @xmath89 , resulting in the intermediate pink noise ( @xmath17 ) segment in the source psd , in between of the white noise ( @xmath90 ) below @xmath91 and the red noise ( @xmath18 ) above @xmath92 .",
    "the shallower slopes of the high - energy @xmath0-ray psd ( as compared to the optical and radio psds ) could be therefore understood by hypothesizing , following @xcite , that the @xmath0-ray variability in pks0735@xmath20178 is shaped by a linear superposition of two types of stochastic processes : ( i ) the same process driving synchrotron ( optical and radio ) variability , with the relaxation time @xmath87 larger than decades ( since we do not recover the transition from the red noise to the white noise in the optical psd up to timescales of @xmath93 years ) ; and ( ii ) the additional process relevant only in the inverse - compton ( @xmath0-ray ) domain , characterized by a relaxation timescale @xmath94 shorter than , or at most of the order of , days ( the shortest variability timescales covered by our analysis of the _ fermi_-lat psd ) .    note that in this scenario there need not be some instability operating within the jet on the timescale @xmath87 which is driving the synchrotron variability  the `` drivers '' can instead be random ( stochastic ) fluctuations in local jet conditions .",
    "such fluctuations dissipate their energy and accelerate plasma particles , thus creating fluctuations in the distribution of ultra - relativistic jet electrons .",
    "the acceleration process itself and the radiative response of the accelerated electrons are , however , delayed with respect to the input perturbations by @xmath87 , so that in the time domain below @xmath87 the flux changes are smoothed out and damped ( forming the red noise segment of the psd ) .",
    "the jet adjusts , forgetting about the input perturbations , only on timescales longer than @xmath87 , for which the flux changes become uncorrelated ( forming the white noise segment of the psd ) .    at this point",
    "we can only speculate about the nature of the input perturbations inferred above .",
    "they could be identified with , for example , local fluctuations in the plasma bulk velocity , leading to the formation of a complex system of internal shocks and plasma turbulence , possibly passing through and interacting with a stationary reconfinement shock further down the jet @xcite .",
    "alternatively , input disturbances could be related to a turbulent magnetic field inherited from strongly magnetized accretion disk and carried out by the jet ( see in this context @xcite ; also @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "a relatively long relaxation timescale @xmath87 would correspond to some global ( magneto-)hydrodynamical timescale characterizing an extended blazar emission region .",
    "meanwhile , in the @xmath0-ray regime , the additional process should be related to inhomogeneities in the local ( radiating fluid rest frame ) energy densities of soft photons , inverse - comptonized to higher energies by the jet electrons in the neighboring cells of the outflow .",
    "a natural `` relaxation '' timescale in this case should be simply a light crossing timescale for the jet region where the bulk of the observed emission is being produced .",
    "for @xmath95day , one then has the corresponding jet radii @xmath96pc , and the distances from the core @xmath97pc , where , for order - of - magnitude estimates only , we assumed a conical jet with a half - opening angle @xmath98 , and the volume - averaged jet bulk lorentz and doppler factors , @xmath99 .    in the interpretation mentioned above , which we will discuss in detail in future work",
    ", we must revisit the overly simplistic assumption of a single homogeneous emission zone in blazar jets .",
    "instead , we propose that _ all _ the observed blazar emission , variable on timescales of years , months , days , and hours  i.e. , both the long - term large - amplitude variability and the microvariability  is generated by an underlying single _ stochastic _ process ( radio and optical frequencies ) , or a linear superposition of such processes ( @xmath0-ray regime ) , within a highly non - uniform portion of the outflow extending from the jet base up to the @xmath100pc - scale distances .",

    "[ fig : a1](c ) , the analogous psds derived for the mean - subtracted light curve are given , all in arbitrary units .",
    "as shown , the general shape of the psd is recovered well in the derived peridograms , with slopes @xmath124 estimated by fitting straight lines in the log - log space . here the difference with the true psd , @xmath18 , is exactly due to the red noise leakage effect . in addition , one may see that in the periodograms derived for the original light curve ( i.e. , the light curve without mean subtraction ) , ripples arise in the low - frequency segments of the power spectra derived using the dft methods , depending on the particular shapes of the window functions applied . in principle , this kind of a distortion of the power spectrum should be present only around the 0th frequency in the power spectrum ( as is the case with rectangular window ) .",
    "we found out , however , that with the usage of bartlett or hanning windows , lower frequencies ( other than the 0th frequency ) are affected as well .",
    "these ripples / distortions are minimized in the periodogram derived for the mean - subtracted light curve using the dft with the hanning window : as discussed in detail in @xcite , the hanning window has the lowest sidelobe level and higher fall - off rate as compared to rectangular and bartlett windows .",
    "we repeated the analysis for a light curve without any global monotonic trend .",
    "the results of the simulations are presented in figure [ fig : a1](d - f ) . as shown , in this case",
    "the red noise leakage effect is less pronounced ( although still present ) , but the low - frequency ripples still arise in the power spectra calculated using the dft - bartlett and dft - hanning methods for the original light curve .",
    "again , such distortions are minimized in the case of the dft - hanning method applied to the mean - subtracted light curve .",
    "next , we demonstrate that the ls periodogram and fourier transform of the acf do not reproduce correctly steep red noise - type power spectra in the case of unevenly sampled data . generally speaking , in the case of the ls method that is because of a small number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) available to characterize the variability at the highest frequencies . on the other hand , in the periodograms derived using fourier transform of the acf , one can not deconvolve the effect of the spectral window , which becomes more and more prominent for less and less evenly spaced data . in order to demonstrate this",
    ", we simulated the light curve with @xmath18 , containing 1,000 data points with a sampling period of one day ; we then subtract the mean and keep 30% of the data selected at random times to mimic an unevenly sampled dataset ; the simulated light curves are presented in the figure[fig : a2](a ) .",
    "figure[fig : a2](b ) shows the corresponding power spectra derived using the ls method and the fourier transform of the acf ; the figure[fig : a2](c ) gives the response of the spectral window for the fourier transform of the acf . as shown , the derived psds ( slopes @xmath122 0.13 and @xmath580.37 for the ls periodogram and the fourier transform of the acf , respectively ) , are very different from the true psd ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the flattening of the derived power spectrum at high variability frequencies in the case of the ls periodogram is due to the aforementioned dof problem , which introduces artificial power in the high frequency range of the spectrum . in the case of the fourier transform of the acf , which is free of such a `` missing data points '' problem ,",
    "the flattening is instead due to a substantial amount of variability power provided by the spectral window .",
    "note in this context that the spectral window does always introduce some extra power in the peridograms derived based on the fourier transform , but in case of evenly sampled data there is no such extra power at frequencies other than the zeroth fourier frequency . for unevenly sampled data",
    "this extra power becomes , however , significant when compared to the true variability power , particularly in the highest frequency range ; as a result the derived power spectra are artificially flattened .",
    "fourier transforming of the acf instead of the initial light curve does not provide any solution in this respect , since the window function can not be deconvolved from the derived power spectrum .    finally , we argue that the only method enabling one to produce a robust derivation of the power spectrum for unevenly sampled data , must rely on a linear interpolation of the light curve . in order to do so , we start from the unevenly sampled time series shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : a2 ] , which is then interpolated on a regular grid with a sampling interval of 0.5 day .",
    "the figure[fig : a3](a ) shows this original unevenly sampled time series along with the linearly interpolated time series ; the corresponding power spectra derived using the ls method and the dft method with three different window functions are presented in the figure[fig : a3](b ) .",
    "the psd slopes are estimated via linear fitting in the log - log space down to the nyquist frequency of the original time series ( @xmath125 days ) . as shown , all the methods considered reproduce now the true psd reasonably well .",
    "however , keeping in mind the fact that for the time series with a global monotonic trend the dft - hanning method provides the best results ( in particular against the red noise leakage effect ) , we conclude that this method is the most robust one ."
