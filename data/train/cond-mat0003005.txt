    "in the past two decades , the percentage of theoretical investigations of materials based on atomistic computer simulations has steadily increased .",
    "those using either an _ ab - initio _ or a tight - binding independent electron description of interactions are able to account for chemical bond formation and breaking , and are particularly worthy of attention , as reflected in the 1998 nobel prize for chemistry .",
    "one shortcoming of the usual implementation of such methods is that the number of operations scales as the third power of the number of atoms n , i.e. , their computational cost is @xmath2 .",
    "currently this limits the number of atoms in the system that can be treated even using very powerful computers . _",
    "ab - initio _ methods certainly give more precise results than semiempirical tight - binding methods , but besides being based on more complicated hamiltonians , they require much more extensive basis sets to expand the wave functions of electrons .",
    "empirical tight - binding methods provide a useful compromise between classical empirical potential approaches and _ ab - initio _ methods , because they retain a quantum mechanical description of the electrons , ultimately responsible for chemical bonding , but the hamiltonian is parametrized and the wavefunctions expanded in a minimal set of atomic orbitals . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of atoms which can be handled with even the simplest _ ab - initio _ method , the local density approximation@xcite commonly used in materials science is one to two orders of magnitude less than with tight - binding methods within the same computational constraints . whereas chemists are interested in studying large , complex molecules , materials scientists",
    "are concerned with the properties of clusters , solids with specific defects or disorder , surfaces , interfaces , artificial structures and their interactions .",
    "reliable computations of properties require simulations on large enough finite systems , e.g. enclosed in a `` box '' with periodic boundary conditions applied .    in order to increase the number of atoms in the system and to study dynamical process or finite - temperature properties obtained from time averages",
    ", efforts are constantly made to reduce computational cost .",
    "for this reason , many kinds of linear scaling methods have been introduced , tested and compared .",
    "the interested reader is referred to recent reviews@xcite .",
    "linear scaling or _",
    "o(n ) _ means that the computation time is proportional to the number n of atoms in the system , just like in classical simulations with finite - range interaction potentials@xcite . in this contribution",
    "we concentrate on a particular orbital - based linear scaling method which , in conjunction with a tight - binding hamiltonian , has been successfully applied to _ c _ and _ si _ systems@xcite .",
    "this contribution is organized in following way : first we review the approximations and the method , then we present results on @xmath4 and @xmath5 reconstructed surfaces which serve to validate the method for future applications . at the end",
    "we compare our results with previous lda and tight - binding computations and summarize our conclusions .",
    "the empirical tight - binding ( tb ) approximation allows the quantum mechanical nature of covalent bonding to enter the interaction hamiltonian in a natural way rather than through additional _",
    "ad hoc _ angular terms in a classical potential .    in tb models",
    "the total energy of the system is expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a repulsive two - body potential which includes the ion - ion repulsion and the electron - electron interactions which are double counted in the electronic `` band - structure '' term @xmath8 .",
    "this term describes chemical bonding , it can be written as , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the tb hamiltonian , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are its eigenvalues and eigenstates , and @xmath13 is their occupancy .",
    "the total number of valence electrons is from now on denoted as n and the total number of single particle states is then n/2 if we assume double occupancy , i.e. , spin degeneracy for each state(@xmath14 ) .",
    "the occupied eigenstates can in principle be determined by diagonalization , but in our work diagonalization is only used at the very end of each computation to check its accuracy .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of @xmath10 are described by invariant two - center matrix elements , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , between the set of @xmath17 atomic orbitals(assumed orthonormal ) . by adjusting their values at the interatomic distance @xmath18 = 2.35  in the equilibrium diamond - like structure , as well as diagonal elements @xmath19 , @xmath20",
    ", a good fit to the position and dispersion of the occupied valence bands of si can be obtained  @xcite .    in order to study properties of covalently bonded systems with defects or free surfaces",
    "tight - binding model must be transferable to different physically relevant environments .",
    "an important advance was due to goodwin , skinner and pettifor@xcite who showed that it is possible to set up a tb model which accurately describes the energy - versus - volume behaviour of si in crystalline phases with different atomic coordination , and reproduces the structure of small si clusters .",
    "we therefore adopt the functional form suggested by gsp@xcite for the distance dependence of the two - center matrix elements and of the two - body potential : @xmath21 \\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath22 @xmath23 \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the interatomic separations , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are parameters which are determined by fitting judiciously chosen properties .",
    "the resulting high values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 ensure a rapid decay of @xmath31 , @xmath32 beyond @xmath33 , @xmath34 . in molecular dynamics(md )",
    "simulations where a finite range of @xmath24 is explored , the quantities in eqs.([scalingfunction]-[repulsivepotential ] ) are further multiplied by a smoothed step function which switches from 1 to 0 in a narrow interval about a cutoff radius @xmath35 .",
    "as explained below , similar couplings between si and h atoms are required in some of our computations . because hydrogen has a single occupied _",
    "s_-state , only @xmath36 and @xmath37 matrix elements must be parametrized .",
    "@xmath38 couplings are negligible at the separations considered here .      within the above framework ,",
    "improved sets of parameters were subsequently developed for si - si and si - h interactions . in this contribution",
    ", we used the two different sets of parameters described in detail by kwon _ _ et al__@xcite and bowler _ _ et al__@xcite .",
    "the si - si parametrization of kwon _ _ et al__@xcite is rather complicated ; thus @xmath33 s , @xmath29 s depend on @xmath39 and the repulsive contribution is represented by a nonlinear function of the second term in eq.([tot ] ) .",
    "the parameters are fitted to many properties of _ si _ in the diamond structure and to computed(lda ) cohesive energies vs. density of four different structures .",
    "the resulting properties of liquid si and of small si clusters are in remarkable agreement with experiments and with _ ab - initio _ computations . on the other hand",
    ", this parametrization uses a cut - off which is beyond second nearest neighbours ; this implies significantly larger computing times .",
    "the revised gsp parametrization of bowler _",
    "et al _ @xcite is less complicated than the previous one ; _",
    "si - si _ parameters were fitted to fewer properties in the diamond and @xmath40-tin structures , _ si - h _ parameters to properties of @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , the cut - off radius @xmath33 can be chosen between nearest and next - nearest - neighbours ; thus this parametrization is very well suited for linear scaling computations .",
    "it has in fact been successfully applied to defects and hydrogen diffusion on si(001 )  @xcite .",
    "traditional electronic structure methods solve the schrdinger equation by expanding one - electron wavefunctions in a fixed basis set ( plane waves , atomic orbitals or combinations thereof ) and by diagonalizing the resulting secular equation for the expansion coefficients . in spite of significant progress achieved by applying efficient diagonalization algorithms ,",
    "the required computing time is proportional to @xmath42 , _ p _ being the number of basis functions . because @xmath43 , the computational cost is @xmath44 , the scaling factor depending on the method , being small in the case of empirical tight - binding .",
    "nevertheless , the diagonalization of @xmath45 for each atomic geometry or at each step of md simulation limits the number of atoms that can be currently studied in conventional tbmd computations to about 100 using a workstation and around 1000 using a supercomputer .",
    "the recently developed linear scaling methods compute the total energy by minimizing a functional expressed in terms of localized orbitals in real space .",
    "although typical eigenstates in a condensed system extend throughout most of it , a unitary transformation yields linear combination of the former which are localized about particular sites .",
    "on the basis of exact model calculations  @xcite , these so - called wannier orbitals are believed to decay exponentially in systems with a finite energy gap between occupied and empty states  @xcite .",
    "this applies in particular to the finite systems on which computations are carried out , although the effective gap can be small and corresponding decay slow if the corresponding real system is metallic .",
    "the key feature of @xmath3 methods is that the total energy and the forces acting on individual atoms are evaluated _ without computing the eigenvalues and eigenstates of @xmath45_. this is accomplished by dividing the full system into finite subsystems and by defining _",
    "localized orbitals _",
    "\\{@xmath7 } which are forced to vanish outside each subsystem@xcite .",
    "these _ localized regions _ ( lr ) are the electronic equivalents of the _ linked cells _ which ensure _ o(n ) _ scaling in classical simulation@xcite .",
    "intuition and experience suggest that the minimum size of each localization region depends on physical and chemical properties of the constituents , and not on the size of the system whole .",
    "the size of the localized regions ( which must exceed the range of @xmath45 ) is always the factor which limits the accuracy of an @xmath3 calculation .",
    "another key ingredient to achieve @xmath3 scaling is the definition of an appropriate energy functional whose minimization requires neither explicit orthogonalization of the auxiliary electronic orbitals , nor the inversion of their overlap matrix @xmath46 .",
    "this functional is in general different from that defined in eq.([tot ] ) , but must have the same global minimum in the limit of infinite localization regions .",
    "otherwise it yields an upperbound which in practice , must be close to the minimum energy even for relatively small lr s .",
    "this can in fact be achieved  @xcite .",
    "o(n ) _ methods are based on different functionals which , however , share this remarkable property .    one convenient energy functional which satisfies these requirements is  @xcite : @xmath47   = 2\\sum ^{m}_{ij=1}(2\\delta _ { ij}-s_{ij})<\\phi _ { j}\\left| \\hat{h }",
    "-\\mu \\right| \\phi _ { i}>+\\mu n\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath48 is the first order truncated series expansion of the inverse overlap matrix @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "the functional defined in eq.([3 ] ) depends on the number m localized orbitals ( lo ) , and on a global variable @xmath51 which determines the highest filled state and hence the total electronic charge in the system at the minimum .",
    "taking @xmath52 helps avoid unphysical solutions  @xcite , depending on the initial choice of the orbitals , which can otherwise be obtained .",
    "in order to find the electronic ground state energy for a given spatial configuration of the atoms , the functional is minimized with respect to the lo s .",
    "normally each lr is centered at an atomic site _",
    "i _ and encompasses all neighbours connected by n bonds ; it is then denoted by nlr . then lo @xmath53 centered at atomic site _",
    "i _ can be expressed as @xmath54 where @xmath55 s are the atomic basis functions of atom _ j _ , the index _",
    "l _ runs over orbital components ( e.g. @xmath56 for carbon or silicon and s for h ) , @xmath57 indicates the set of atoms within the localization region centered at site _",
    "i _ , and @xmath58 is the corresponding number of basis functions .    the functional is efficiently minimized using a conjugate gradient ( cg ) algorithm@xcite . the required derivatives @xmath59\\ ] ]",
    "are evaluated at each iteration step . using eq.([4 ] )",
    "the matrix elements can be expressed in terms of the slater - koster energy integrals @xmath60  @xcite ; those energy integrals can be further expressed in terms of direction cosines and of the invariant two - center matrix elements defined by eq.([scalingfunction])(see appendix b ) .",
    "because each derivative needs to be evaluated only in the localization region @xmath61 , the required number of operations scales linearly with the number of atoms in the system .",
    "the global variable @xmath51 is initially chosen well above the estimated fermi energy of the system , then iteratively adjusted until the total charge of the system becomes equal to the charge consistent with global neutrality when convergence is achieved , i.e. , the ground state energy corresponding to the assumed lrs is attained , and @xmath51 is the chemical potential ( fermi energy ) of the electrons@xcite .      in this work",
    "we consider only known metastable structures of silicon surfaces in order to test the performance and accuracy of the method . to determine such structures , atoms in several surface layers are allowed to move under the influence of the forces @xmath62 until all their components become smaller than a preset tolerance ( 0.01 _ ev /  _ ) and the energy _",
    "_ reaches a minimum . instead of using a standard minimization procedure ,",
    "this is achieved by introducing a damping term in the standard verlet algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this term is adjusted so that the resulting motion is almost critically damped , so that the fastest possible relaxation is achieved .",
    "eq.([7 ] ) is physically meaningful only if the electrons are in their ground state ( born - oppenheimer approximation ) .",
    "therefore , molecular dynamics can be started only after electronic convergence with respect to the initial atomic configuration has been achieved as described in section 2.3 .",
    "this rather tedious procedure is necessary at the start of a calculation .",
    "the required computing time depends on the initial choice of the los and @xmath51 . to be safe , we start with random coefficients in eq.([4 ] ) and a high @xmath51 . to ensure stable md integration , the time step must be small compared to a typical optical vibration period .",
    "the corresponding atomic displacements are then small and typically do not strongly perturb the lo coefficients , except if same atom(s ) move out or into certain lrs .",
    "therefore , after each atom move enough electronic iterations must be performed in order to reach the slightly modified ground state ( within a relative tolerance @xmath63 ) .",
    "fortunately , only small adjustments of @xmath64 are necessary once global charge neutrality has been established ; they can be performed automatically .",
    "the number of electronic steps depends on the system , the narrower its energy gap at the fermi level(always existing in a finite system ) , the more electronic steps are needed",
    "o(n ) _ performance is achieved if this number of electronic iterations is independent of n and if the necessary computing time is less than that required for diagonalization .      if significant atomic rearrangements occur in the course of a molecular dynamics simulation , it is sometimes difficult to avoid unphysical charge transfer between neighboring atoms or layers .",
    "to reduce such effects , which slow down convergence and sometimes lead to unphysical solutions , local charge neutrality can be approximately imposed by adding an extra term @xmath65 , where @xmath66 for _ si _ and 1.0 for _ h _ atoms , and the charge around site _",
    "i _ is expressed as @xmath67 where @xmath68 indicates the projection of the localized orbital @xmath53 on the localized region around site _",
    "i _  @xcite .",
    "such a term is obtained by making a local mean field approximation to the hubbard hamiltonian and assuming no spin - polarized solutions@xcite . the strength _",
    "u _ of the hubbard - like term has been estimated and tabulated by harrison@xcite who also discussed its reduction by dielectric polarization . in covalent systems",
    "such hubbard - like contributions must essentially vanish once convergence is achieved , for atoms which have a bulk - like environment .",
    "in this section we present our recent test calculations with the method described above which has hitherto been mainly applied to carbon systems .",
    "our ultimate goal is to simulate atomic force microscopy(afm ) and manipulation with a si tip .",
    "we present and discuss our results on _ si(111 ) _ and _ si(001 ) _ surface reconstructions which have previously been studied by tight - binding and _ ab - initio _ methods , and exhibit characteristic features due to rebonding of surface atoms .",
    "such reconstructions reduce the density of energetically unfavourable `` dangling bonds '' on surface atoms , but induce distortions from the tetrahedral bonding pattern in the bulk .",
    "optimum surface structures represent a delicate balance between different effects and can not usually be guessed by chemical and physical intuition .",
    "these reconstructed surfaces are therefore well - suited for validating the method and are also interesting candidates for controlled atom manipulation experiments .",
    "surface properties are extracted from computations on slabs with a finite number of layers .",
    "this number must be large enough to suppress artificial coupling between the free slab surfaces which can arise owing to the overlap of surface states and/or to strain fields induced by atomic rearrangements in surface layers . in order to approximate the effect of the crystalline substrate , atoms in the two centeral layers are held in their bulk positions .",
    "alternatively , the bottom two layers are fixed , and all exposed dangling bonds are passivated with hydrogen atoms so as to preserve tetrahedral coordination .",
    "similar accuracy is expected with half the number of free layers , compared to the former , symmetric slab . having this in mind ,",
    "we have investigated the influence of factors which , if chosen properly , should have little effect on physical meaningful results .",
    "this includes the number of free and fixed ( bulk - like ) layers in the slabs used , the influence of h - passivation at the bottom , the shape and lateral dimensions of the computational supercell , the size of the localization regions , the tight - binding parametrization , starting from configurations which had the periodicity and some of the rebonding characteristics of desired reconstructions .",
    "all this required many computations which were performed on not too large systems in order to economize computing time .",
    "thus the emphasis here is on validation rather than on achieving _",
    "o(n ) _ performance , although this was demonstrated in the larger systems containing a few hundred atoms .",
    "the metastable 5@xmath15 reconstruction plays an important role in the conversion from 2@xmath11 reconstruction , obtained upon cleavage , to the stable 7@xmath17 reconstruction of the si(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "it exhibits the characteristic features of the das model first proposed for si(111)-7x7  @xcite , which are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "one important difference is that the 5@xmath15 reconstruction has the same average density of atoms in surface layers as the bulk terminated si(111 ) surface , whereas additional si adatoms must be supplied to form the 7@xmath17 reconstruction .",
    "we start with a ten - layers thick inversion - symmetric slab which has two bulk truncated ( 111 ) surfaces at the top and bottom , encompassing two adjacent 5@xmath15 surface unit cells .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are then maintained in the lateral directions .",
    "we have also repeated some of the computations with a six - layers slab passivated by h atoms at the bottom , similar to that used by adams and sankey  @xcite . following these authors , the initial configuration on the free surface(s )",
    "is set up by laterally shifting ten atoms in the surface layer on the left side of each 5@xmath15 cell so that they are placed above fourth layer atoms .",
    "then five atoms at one edge of the other `` unfaulted '' triangular half and the second - layer atom above the `` corner hole '' are placed at the positions of the adatoms so that their bond lengths to the nearest first - layer atoms are equal to the bulk interatomic distance @xmath18 . during the combined relaxation of electrons and ions , dimers spontaneously formed along the boundaries between",
    "`` faulted '' and `` unfaulted '' halves shortly after we started the damped molecular dynamics calculation . at the end , we obtained the relaxed structure consistent with the das model illustrated in fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "of the 25 dangling bonds per 5@xmath15 cell on the truncated ( 111 ) surface only 9 are left : one on the corner hole atom ( ch ) , two on the restatom(r ) and six on the adatoms(ad ) .",
    "the former three are doubly occupied , whereas surface states derived from those on the adatoms are partially occupied by the remaining three electrons  @xcite .",
    "thus one expects the @xmath4 surface have metallic properties just like @xmath69 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "_ a posteriori _ diagonalization revealed a tiny `` energy gap '' ( @xmath70 ) in our relaxed structure .",
    "one might also expect problems due to the assumed double occupancy .",
    "in fact relaxation in a slab encompassing a single @xmath71 surface unit cell produced a distorted das structure with twisted dimers . on the other hand ,",
    "no such distortions have been found in previous @xmath44 computations of @xmath69 with similar slabs which relied on occupied eigenstates at the @xmath72-point(zero wave - vector ) obtained by diagonalization  @xcite or @xcite by total energy minimization _ with _ orthonormality constraints  @xcite .",
    "deviations might arise owing to the small size of the localization region(n=3 ) in our o(n ) computations .",
    "fortunately this is not the case , as discussed in the following section , if slabs encompassing on even number number of dangling bonds on each surface are used .      our relaxed configuration exhibits common characteristic features found in previous computations of the @xmath71  @xcite and of the @xmath73  @xcite reconstructions .",
    "in what follows we compare results obtained with bowler s parametrization , localization regions encompassing third neighbours and a @xmath74 computational cell containing four free layers ( not counting the adatoms ) and two fixed _ si _",
    "layers with the bottom one saturated by h atoms . in order to check the influence of free and fixed(bulk - like ) layers in the slab , of passivation by h at the bottom , of the size of the localization regions , and of the tight - binding parametrization",
    "we have performed many calculations of the relaxed geometry of the @xmath71 reconstruction . from the result summarized in appendix",
    "a one can conclude that the influence of these factors on the final configuration is negligibly small .",
    "this is a very encouraging result .",
    "furthermore the bond lengths listed in table  [ bond1 ] are remarkably close ( except for dimers ) to those found in recent tb calculations for the @xmath73 reconstruction based on a symmetric slab with one free layer less on each side  @xcite .",
    "small deviations occur , however , compared to bond lengths extracted from a lda computation for the same system  @xcite .",
    "similar deviations also occur compared to an earlier tb computation for a h - passivated slab with two less free layers  @xcite . in that case",
    ", these deviations might be due to that restriction or to the somewhat different parametrization .",
    "more significant deviations appear when height differences between adatoms and rest atoms in the two halves of the surface unit cells are compared(see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "our computed differences are larger than those found in previous computations for the @xmath73 reconstruction with a smaller number of free layers . on the other hand ,",
    "height difference between adatoms is only half of that found in a pioneering computation for @xmath4 based on a h - passivated slab like ours  @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to that work , we found that adatoms in each half are equivalent , just like corner hole and central adatoms are on the @xmath69 surface .",
    "these two discrepancies are probably due to the _ non self - consistent _ lda - based approximation used in ref .  @xcite . tb computations , including ours , are only rudimentary self - consistent if the hubbard term is included , but since the parameters are fitted to experimental data  @xcite and/or self - consistent lda computations  @xcite , they can yield better results .",
