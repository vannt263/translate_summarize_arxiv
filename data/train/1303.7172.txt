    "understanding the dynamics of diffusion and transport in systems and materials with disorder is of paramount importance in multiple branches of modern science and engineering .",
    "the areas where the disorder - related phenomena are ubiquitous include biology,@xcite condensed matter physics,@xcite polymer@xcite and nano science.@xcite carriers of various nature can be involved into transport phenomena in different systems : excitons in molecular or semiconductor quantum dot aggregates and polymer chains / films ; charge carriers ( electrons or holes ) in disordered semiconductors , phonons and photons in disordered heat conductors and photonic crystals , respectively .",
    "the nature of disorder can also vary a great deal from system to system .",
    "one of the most important sources of disorder is the energy dispersion ",
    "the dynamics of a system occurs in a configuration space with a rugged landscape so that potential barriers have to be overcome , e.g. , by an exciton to migrate within a polymer chain .",
    "specifically , it is well documented that in amorphous conjugated polymers , excitons can be localized in short ordered segments of a polymer chain , where the energy of the exciton depends on the length of the segment giving rise to the energy disorder .",
    "an inevitable consequence is that the exciton , generated at an arbitrary site in the excitonic density of states distribution , will migrate ( spectral diffusion ) and , ultimately , tend to relax towards low - energy states.@xcite it has to be noted that in amorphous films of conjugated polymers the energy disorder can be strong in a sense that the site - to - site energy variation can significantly exceed @xmath0 at room temperature.@xcite possible mechanisms of exciton - exciton coupling between polymer segments include frster resonance energy transfer ( due to dipole - dipole coulomb interaction),@xcite as well as dexter energy transfer ( due to the direct overlap of electronic wavefunctions).@xcite    exciton transport in aggregates of semiconductor quantum dots has received much attention lately because of multiple promising applications in photovoltaics , electronics and information processing . within such aggregates , the energy of lowest exciton varies between quantum dots due to the quantum mechanical confinement of carriers in quantum dots with size distribution .",
    "@xcite in these systems , photoinduced excitons have been demonstrated to efficiently migrate within an aggregate.@xcite one of the possibilities to make quantum dots `` talk '' to each other , i.e. , to make an exciton migrate , is via aerogels - a special type of aggregates - which are of great promise for photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications.@xcite    diffusion and transport phenomena in the presence of disorder are often characterized by the absence of well - defined time , size or energy scales .",
    "the renormalization group ( rg ) approach is one of the most suitable methods to study dynamics under such conditions .",
    "the rg has been extensively applied before to study the diffusion in energy - disordered systems , however mostly for the case of weak disorder.@xcite transport in the case of strong disorder , i.e. , where the energy dispersion significantly exceeds the temperature ( in energy units ) of the environment , has been studied to a much lesser extent mostly due to the lack of appropriate methods.@xcite in this paper , we introduce the numerical real - space rg method capable of studying hopping diffusion in the presence of a strong energy disorder .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the notation and general theory is introduced in section  [ sec : general ] .",
    "the rg transformation is described in section  [ sec : cgraining ] .",
    "general numerical results and the discussion of the rg flow are discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : num ] and [ sec : flow ] , respectively .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "we describe the hopping dynamics of a system with energy disorder as markovian hopping between nodes of a graph , where the hopping probability is defined by rate constants assigned to edges of the graph [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : graph](a ) for graph schematics ] .",
    "we briefly discuss how the proposed rg method can also be applied in the continuous case . ]",
    "physically , each node of this graph can represent an ordered ( i.e. , unbent ) segment of a polymer chain with kinks , so that at each moment of time an exciton is localized within a single segment .",
    "the time - dependent population is assigned to each node of the graph , representing the probability to find an exciton within the corresponding segment at a specific moment of time .",
    "the length dispersion of segments results in a variation of exciton energy , thus introducing the energy disorder .",
    "accordingly , each node of the graph is parametrized with energy .",
    "the probability for an exciton to hop from one node to another is specified by two hopping rate constants ( forward and backward ) , which are assigned to each edge of the graph , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph](a ) for nodes @xmath1 and @xmath2 . an important characteristic of the so formed graph is its connectivity  the average number of edges connected to a node . in principle , a hopping rate constant can be non - zero between any two nodes of the graph , regardless of how distant they are from each other .",
    "a physical example of this is a non - vanishing exciton - exciton coupling between two very distant segments of a polymer chain , or between distant quantum dots within an aggregate .",
    "however , hopping rate constants typically decay rapidly with distance , @xmath3 , e.g. , as @xmath4 in the case of the dipole - dipole ( frster ) or @xmath5 in the case of the exchange - type ( dexter ) interaction , where @xmath6 is a characteristic range of interaction . henceforth , we allow edges to link only nearby nodes , thus restricting the graph connectivity to be finite even in the thermodynamic limit , where the number of nodes within the graph grows to infinity .",
    "the hopping dynamics on the so introduced graph is governed by the following kinetic equation @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the vector of time - dependent node populations .",
    "we denote the projection of an arbitrary vector @xmath9 onto node @xmath10 via @xmath11 , so that , e.g. , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the total number of nodes in the graph ) is the population of node @xmath10 at time @xmath14 .",
    "the rate matrix is constructed as follows.@xcite its off - diagonal elements read as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the rate constant for hopping from node @xmath17 to node @xmath10 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : graph](a ) ] .",
    "the diagonal matrix elements are not independent and are determined from the population conservation condition , which requires the sum of elements in any column of @xmath18 to vanish identically , yielding @xmath19 therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : mastereq ] ) is the gain - loss equation for populations of nodes .    an additional constraint imposed on the rate constants is the detailed balance @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 throughout the paper ) .",
    "the energy of node @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "( [ eq : detbal ] ) guarantees that state @xmath24 is the equilibrium state of the system , i.e. , it is the steady state solution of eq .",

    "( [ eq : conserv ] ) and ( [ eq : detbal ] ) , can be diagonalized as @xmath28,@xcite yielding is due to the detailed balance and population conservation constraints imposed.@xcite ] @xmath29 here , we note that since @xmath18 is not symmetric , both right and left , i.e. , @xmath30 , eigenvectors have to be found . because of the detailed balance , all the eigenvalues are strictly non - negative and the lowest eigenvalue is always zero , @xmath31 , corresponding to the equilibrium .",
    "the normalized right and left eigenvectors corresponding to this equilibrium mode , @xmath32 , are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath35 .",
    "( [ eq : meq_eigen ] ) completely solves the problem defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mastereq])-([eq : detbal ] ) , since any observable which depends on node populations at an arbitrary moment of time can now be expressed via eq .",
    "( [ eq : meq_eigen ] ) .",
    "for example , the average energy of an exciton at time @xmath14 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the vector of node energies , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq : en_av ] ) , we explicitly used the population conservation requirement .",
    "eq .  ( [ eq : meq_eigen ] ) is an exact solution of the problem of hopping dynamics on a graph",
    ". however , this solution might not be optimal for the following reasons .",
    "first , the dispersion of node energies , @xmath39 , leads to the emergence of local minima where the population can be trapped at low temperatures . from the perspective of diagonalization of rate matrix @xmath18",
    ", it results in a very broad spectrum of eigenvalues and , therefore , coexistence of different timescales . the relaxation _ within _ local minima occurs rapidly , but the population transfer _ between _ local minima is slow due to the necessity to overcome potential barriers .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph](b ) , where relaxation within local minima ( 1 - 2 - 3 and 5 - 6 - 7 ) can be fast , but it is hard to overcome the potential barrier ( 3 - 4 - 5 ) at low temperatures , which results in a very slow inter - minimum transfer . the natural criterion for the separation of timescales for these two processes can be introduced as @xmath40 , where @xmath41^{1/2}$ ] is the standard deviation of node energies , and @xmath42 is their mean . at @xmath43 the eigenvalues of @xmath18 can be spread over many orders of magnitude , rendering the numerical diagonalization of the rate matrix inaccurate due to numerical round - off errors .",
    "the second reason is that the existence of a small parameter , @xmath44 , might simplify the solution and analysis of the problem , and also might allow one to treat much larger systems than those dealt with by the brute - force direct numerical diagonalization . similarly to how the introduction of a small parameter simplifies a problem in quantum mechanics by allowing for a perturbative solution , we intend to explicitly use the smallness of @xmath44 to simplify the solution of the problem and make it more physically transparent .",
    "a straightforward approach is to explicitly separate the time scales by first solving for population relaxation dynamics within each local minima .",
    "then , the inter - minima transfer problem is solved considering population in each minima to be in its own quasi - equilibrium .",
    "this is similar to transition state theory , where the timescale separation allows one to consider both reactants and products equilibrated within respective potential wells.@xcite using the analogy between energy dispersion of the graph and rain / water collection in a rugged landscape we will refer to local minima as _ drainage basins _ or simply basins .",
    "thus , we propose to divide the entire graph into a collection of basins , and first solve for the population dynamics _ within _ each basin independently .",
    "then , the population is considered to be equilibrated within each basin and dynamics of population transfer _ between _ basins will be solved for . to make a step further",
    ", one can notice that the population transfer between the equilibrated basins can be again treated as a markovian hopping process on a new graph which describes _ inter - basin _ hopping dynamics .",
    "this new graph can be thought of as a result of coarse - graining of the initial graph .",
    "the construction of this new graph out of the initial one is essentially an rg transformation ( or step ) applied to the original graph .",
    "this rg step can be performed multiple times consecutively giving rise to a _ hierarchy _ of levels of coarse - graining . at each such level , the population is being transferred between nodes , and each of these nodes represents anequilibrated \" basin of the graph belonging to the previous hierarchy level .",
    "[ fig : hierarchy ] schematically depicts the consecutive rg transformations applied to the original ( microscopic ) graph .        in this figure ,",
    "the microscopic graph is denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "the basins of this graph are outlined by the red contours , and upon the rg step , each basin within @xmath45 becomes just a single node ( red circle ) in a new graph , @xmath46 .",
    "once @xmath47 is constructed , the rg transformation can be applied to this new graph , yielding @xmath48 and so on . in what follows , each graph within the rg hierarchy will be designated by @xmath49 , where index @xmath50 stands for the number of rg transformations applied consecutively to the original graph @xmath45 . the ordered set ( lowest to highest ) of the exact eigenvalues of graph @xmath49 ( e.g. , obtained via numerical diagonalization ) is denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "the set of eigenvalues corresponding to relaxation within basins of @xmath49 is denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the number of elements in @xmath53 and @xmath54 is different by the number of basins in @xmath55 .",
    "further , we introduce a notation for the entire spectrum of the system , obtained by @xmath56 successive rg transformations , as @xmath57 if rg transformations were exact , the following equality would hold @xmath58 since an explicit timescale separation is approximate , and therefore also the rg transformation , the validity of this expression depends on the magnitude of @xmath59 at _ each _ level of the hierarchy . in the remainder of the section",
    "we discuss the specific procedure of coarse - graining .",
    "we propose the following algorithm for the coarse - graining procedure :    1 .   in the entire graph ,",
    "nodes are identified which are linked only to nodes of higher energy .",
    "each such low - energy node will be called the `` seed '' of a basin .",
    "2 .   for any other node of index @xmath10 , a node @xmath17",
    "is found so that the following requirements are satisfied : ( i ) there exists an edge linking nodes @xmath10 and @xmath17 , ( ii ) @xmath60 , and ( iii ) of all indices @xmath17 satisfying the first two requirements we choose the one maximizing @xmath61 .",
    "if node @xmath17 has already been associated with any basin ( e.g. , node @xmath17 is a seed ) , we associate node @xmath10 with the same basin .",
    "repeat step 2 until all the the nodes of the graph are associated with basins .",
    "step 1 finds all the seeds and associate them with basins yet to be  grown \" .",
    "the first execution of step 2 associates with basins only the nodes connected directly to basin seeds .",
    "then , nodes connected to seeds through a single node ( i.e. , via two edges ) are associated with basins and so on . at a very low temperature ( i.e. , @xmath62 )",
    ", this approach guarantees that a particle ( e.g. , an exciton ) , initially residing at node @xmath10 , will preferentially relax to the seed of the basin node @xmath10 belongs to . here ,",
    "`` preferential '' means that we construct the basins using the maximum @xmath16 requirement , neglecting all smaller @xmath16 .",
    "this can lead to a non - negligible probability of particle relaxation to other seeds .",
    "this is illustrated by initially putting an exciton on node @xmath63 of the graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph](b ) .",
    "as is seen , it can relax to both seeds @xmath2 and @xmath64 , but we associate node @xmath63 with the left basin if @xmath65 , and with the right basin if @xmath66 .    once basins are formed , we construct a rate matrix @xmath67 for each basin ( @xmath68 is the basin index ) as if it is isolated from the rest of the graph .",
    "in other words , @xmath16 is set to zero if nodes @xmath10 and @xmath17 belong to different basins .",
    "then , a typically small rate matrix for each isolated basin is numerically diagonalized @xmath69 where the lowest eigenvalue vanishes exactly ( @xmath70 ) because of the detailed balance , identically to the case of the entire graph ( see above ) .",
    "the eigenvectors , corresponding to these quasi - equilibrium eigenmodes ( one per basin ) , read as ( right and left eigenvector , respectively ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 equals @xmath1 if node @xmath10 belongs to basin @xmath68 and zero otherwise .",
    "the partition function of basin @xmath68 is given by @xmath73 .",
    "the left and right eigenvectors are obviously orthonormal , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "the problem of `` preferential '' relaxation can lead to a significant underestimation of eigenvalues corresponding to intra - basin relaxation , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "indeed , at very low temperatures the population of node 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph](b ) would decay with the rate constant of @xmath77 .",
    "associating node @xmath63 with a specific basin ( left or right ) , as it is done in the coarse - graining procedure described above , would allow it to decay with rate @xmath78 which can introduce a significant error up to a factor of @xmath79 - graph connectivity .",
    "indeed , for the specific example discussed here ( one - dimensional graph , @xmath80 ) , one has @xmath81 so if @xmath82 and @xmath83 are not too different , eq .",
    "( [ eq : basindiag ] ) produces significantly underestimated intra - basin eigenvalues .",
    "to correct for this , we recalculate eigenvalues of intra - basin relaxation modes as @xmath84 using the language of perturbation theory in quantum mechanics , one can say that these new eigenvalues are first - order corrected relative to the zeroth - order approximation given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : basindiag ] ) . eigenvalues @xmath85 ( @xmath76 ) constitute @xmath52 at a given hierarchy level @xmath50 , and are not modified any more by any further ( consecutive ) rg transformations .",
    "the rate matrix for the the coarse - grained graph , describing the population transfer between basins , is constructed as follows .",
    "the rate constants for population transfer between equilibrated basins are defined as @xmath86 physically , this means that we take equilibrium populations of basin @xmath68 and multiply them by rates of population transfer to basin @xmath87 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath88 where the helmholtz free energy of a basin is defined as @xmath89 .",
    "the new graph is the result of the rg transformation applied to the graph of the previous hierarchy level .",
    "it is constructed as :    1 .",
    "each node is the basin of the previous graph .",
    "the energy of each node is the free energy of the equilibrated basin of the previous graph .",
    "rate constants of population transfer between nodes are given by eq .",

    "initial populations of each node of the new graph are given by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the vector of initial populations of the previous graph .",
    "time - dependent population of each node is interpreted as the total population of a corresponding equilibrated basin of the previous graph .",
    "in contrast to standard rg procedures in statistical physics , where upon an rg step the microscopic information is typically lost , we can keep the entire spectrum of eigenvalues during the coarse - graining procedure . in the coarse - graining procedure we proposed above",
    ", the rate matrix @xmath18 is partially diagonalized at each rg step in a sense that the first rg step applied to @xmath18 transforms the rate matrix to a block - diagonal one .",
    "one of these blocks is exactly diagonal within , as it consists of eigenvalues @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , corresponding to the intra - basin relaxation .",
    "the other block , non - diagonal within , is the rate matrix for inter - basin transitions , constructed out of rates defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : brates ] ) .",
    "each consecutive rg step further decreases the size of this internally non - diagonal block and correspondingly increases the size of the internally diagonal one keeping the overall dimensionality of the full rate matrix the same .",
    "in other words , the rg approach introduced here is a method to approximately diagonalize a certain class of matrices such as rate matrix @xmath18 at low temperature .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that eq .",
    "( [ eq : meq_eigen ] ) is still valid as long as the rg - based diagonalization of @xmath18 is accurate .",
    "for example , eq .  ( [ eq : en_av ] ) can still be used to find the time - resolved average energy of the system .",
    "clearly , only a finite number of consecutive rg transformations can be applied to a finite system , since the size of the graph is rapidly decreasing with each consecutive level of the hierarchy ( see below ) .",
    "in fact , after a certain number of successive rg steps the direct diagonalization is typically possible even for a very large initial system .",
    "the validity and accuracy of the coarse - graining procedure can impose an additional constraint on the maximum number of rg steps .",
    "indeed , @xmath94 - energy dispersion of graph nodes - can be defined at each level of hierarchy , resulting in the whole set of perturbation parameters , @xmath95 .",
    "even if @xmath96 is sufficiently small to guarantee the validity of coarse - graining of the original graph , rg might become inaccurate at hierarchy level @xmath50 when @xmath97 is on the order of @xmath1 .",
    "we discuss this issue in sec .",
    "[ sec : flow ] .",
    "to demonstrate the validity of the proposed rg approach at low temperatures , we consider the following generic systems with energy disorder . regular lattices , either one - dimensional chain ( 1d ) or two - dimensional square ( 2d ) , are constructed . only the nearest neighbors are linked and periodic boundary conditions imposed , forming graph @xmath45 with connectivity @xmath80 and @xmath98 in the 1d and 2d cases , respectively .",
    "hopping rate constants are assigned to each edge of the graph by using the modified version of the miller - abrahams ( ma ) model @xcite @xmath99 node energies , @xmath39 ( @xmath100 ) , are assigned via sampling the gaussian distribution with @xmath101 .",
    "the mean node energy , @xmath102 , is irrelevant for hopping dynamics since only relative node energies enter the expression for the rate constants .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modma ] ) , a single pre - exponential factor is assigned to each edge @xmath103 where @xmath104 is an activation energy of the hopping along edge @xmath105 .",

    "( [ eq : modma ] ) different from the classical ma model , the latter is recovered by setting all the activation energies to some fixed value , e.g. , @xmath108 .",
    "the nature and implications of this modification are discussed in the end of sec .",

    "specifically , it underestimates the large eigenvalues originating with intra - basin relaxation ( compare @xmath114 and @xmath115 in the inset at @xmath116 ) , because an exciton can escape a basin on the same timescale as the intra - basin relaxation occurs , which increases eigenvalues of  intra - basin \" modes .",
    "that rg neglects basin escape processes at short times ( @xmath110 ) leads , in turn , to their effective emergence at long times ( @xmath111 ) , resulting in overestimated values for smaller eigenvalues ( compare @xmath117 at @xmath118 ) . in other words , the incomplete timescale separation at high temperatures can be thought of as an interaction between intra - basin relaxation and basin escape processes , which is not accounted for within rg .",
    "treating this interaction within the second - order perturbation theory would shift high eigenvalues even higher , and low eigenvalues even lower , similarly to the standard second - order perturbative corrections to energy in quantum mechanics .",
    "accordingly , rg underestimates high ( intra - basin ) and overestimates low ( inter - basin ) eigenvalues due to the lack of second - order perturbative corrections .",

    "however , at lower temperatures the zeroth - order and first - order corrected spectra practically coincide ( not shown ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that since the pre - exponential factors of the hopping rate constants are distributed according to eq .",

    "[ fig:1d_rg](c ) ] possesses a broader spectrum than the 2d one [ fig  [ fig:2d_rg](b ) ] .",
    "the reason for this is that 1d diffusion is an exact lower boundary for @xmath126-dimensional diffusion , since hopping between any two distant nodes in @xmath126 dimensions can always be considered as hopping in 1d but along the `` shortest '' path , i.e. , the path with highest rate constants.@xcite    the necessary condition for the coarse - graining procedure developed here to be valid is to have a clear separation of time - scales between intra- and inter - basin dynamics . figs .",

    "an intra - basin relaxation mode within one portion of the large graph does not interact with an inter - basin hopping in some other distant portion of the graph .",
    "therefore , the time - scale separation for these modes is not required for the rg procedure to work .",
    "again , using the language of perturbation theory in quantum mechanics , one can say that for the hybridization of two interacting states to be weak , either the energy separation between the two states has to be large ( i.e. , large time - scale separation ) , or the interaction has to be weak . the latter condition resolves the apparent contradiction with overlapping time - scales in figs .",
    "[ fig:1d_rg ] and [ fig:2d_rg ] , since overlapping eigenvalues belong to intra- and inter - basin modes localized in different portions of the graph .",

    "the _ weak _ disorder rg , discussed by deem and chandler,@xcite demonstrates the same direction of the flow , i.e. , reduction of @xmath59 upon each consecutive rg step at @xmath187 .",
    "in fact , the weak rg flow in this domain ultimately converges to the stable fixed point at @xmath188 , which is the pure diffusion .",
    "neither of these rg approaches is valid in the intermediate disorder regime , @xmath189 .",
    "however , the exact solution for the 1d model suggests that the long - time behavior of 1d model at _ arbitrarily _ strong gaussian disorder is always purely diffusive.@xcite furthermore , the long - time hopping dynamics in 1d model is an exact lower boundary for models with higher dimensionality.@xcite therefore , observing hopping in a model with gaussian energy disorder at increasing length- or time - scale is expected to always correspond to a decreasing effective disorder .",
    "we therefore put a dotted arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgflow ] to reflect the expected flow direction at @xmath189 , even though we are not aware of any rg approach valid in this region .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the rg flow of the distribution of the pre - exponential factors of rate constants .",
    "exponential factors are all _ degenerate _",
    "( i.e. , the same ) within the classical ma model",
    ". however , it is quite obvious that even if this degeneracy is present in @xmath122 , the pre - exponential factors of the rate constants of @xmath47 will have a certain finite dispersion since pre - exponential factors of inter - basin rate constants are determined by activation barriers of hopping between basins , and the heights of these activation barriers are random variables themselves .",
    "thus , it is expected that the degeneracy of the pre - exponential factors ( i.e. , their non - randomness ) is _ irrelevant _ in the rg sense , i.e. , the system flows away from this degeneracy upon consecutive rg transformations . to illustrate this",
    ", we compare the spectra of eigenvalues for the modified and classical ma models , the latter obtained from the modified one by setting the activation energy to a certain fixed non - random value .",
    "[ fig : mavsmma ] shows these spectra ( @xmath190 at @xmath119 for the 2d lattice with 2500 nodes ) for the modified ma model ( black line ) with @xmath104 sampled uniformly within @xmath191 interval , as well as for the classical ma model with the activation energy set to @xmath192 ( magenta diamonds ) , @xmath193 ( red circles ) and @xmath194 ( blue squares ) .",

    "( [ eq : modma_preexp ] ) by fixing the activation energy : @xmath194 ( blue squares ) , @xmath193 ( red circles ) and @xmath192 ( magenta diamonds ) .",
    "all the eigenspectra are evaluated for the 2d system with 2500 nodes at @xmath119 applying two consecutive rg steps .",
    ", width=268 ]    it is seen that in the high-@xmath195 part of the spectrum , the modified and classical ma models produce qualitatively different results .",
    "specifically , the classical ma model produces an almost flat spectrum due to the high degree of degeneracy of eigenvalues .",
    "however , the lower part of the spectrum is qualitatively the same for the two models , except for a vertical shift .",
    "the origin of this shift is clear since , e.g. , at @xmath192 all the rate constants are lower than those for the activation energy uniformly distributed between @xmath196 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum with this fixed activation energy is expected to be generally lower than the one with finite dispersion of activation energies ( compare the black line and magenta diamonds in fig .",
    "[ fig : mavsmma ] ) .",
    "a similar argument explains why the eigenspectrum with @xmath194 is generally higher than the one with the dispersion of pre - exponential factors present ( compare the black line and blue squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : mavsmma ] ) in fact , it is possible to numerically find the fixed activation energy , @xmath193 , at which the lower portion of the eigenspectra of the standard and modified ma models practically coincide .",
    "therefore , the degeneracy , or non - randomness , of the pre - exponential factors is _ irrelevant _ in the rg sense , which is exactly the reason why we adopted the modified ma model from the onset .",
    "in this paper , we formulate and computationally implement a numerical real - space rg approach to study the hopping dynamics on energy - disordered lattices at low temperature .",
    "our approach is similar to methods developed in refs .  , which were originally introduced to treat disordered ising - type models .",
    "this similarity stems from the fact that in both cases fast degrees of freedom can be treated independently from slow ones , giving rise to renormalization of the latter . however , we emphasize that in this work the fast degrees of freedom are not actually `` integrated out '' , since the entire spectrum is recovered , not just its low - energy portion . the other difference of the approach , developed in this work , from that in refs .",
    "is that the former is _ dynamical _ in a sense that the dynamics in the form of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of relaxation modes is recovered at all timescales , and not just equilibrium properties of a system of interest .    in this work , the developed rg",
    "approach is applied to discrete systems , represented by graphs .",
    "in fact , in the case of strong disorder the approach can be straightforwardly applied to continuous systems .",
    "indeed , even if the microscopic system is initially continuous , the population trapping in local minima leads to the appearance of the discrete - like dynamics , i.e. , hopping between potential minima of the continuous landscape .",
    "in other words , an rg transformation can still be introduced , and its first application to the continuous system in the regime of strong disorder immediately leads to hopping on a graph .",
    "thus , the continuity of a system is irrelevant in the rg sense in the case of strong disorder .",
    "interestingly , it is exactly the opposite in the weak disorder limit , where discreteness becomes irrelevant and continuity finally `` sets in '' leading to pure diffusion at large timescales .",
    "we expect the developed approach to become useful in studying hopping dynamics in various systems of practical interest including polymer films and nanoparticle aggregates .",
    "a combination of this method with the weak - disorder rg group@xcite might become especially fruitful .",
    "indeed , as was discussed above , the validity range of strong - disorder rg is limited by the fact that the systemflows away \" from strong disorder upon consecutive rg transformations . however , once the disorder is not strong , the weak - disorder approach can be applied ( at least approximately ) , ultimately leading to the pure diffusion fixed point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : edistr ] ) .",
    "therefore , the combination of the strong - disorder rg method developed in this work with the weak - disorder rg approach might yield a universal methodology capable of treating hopping dynamics in systems with an arbitrary strength of disorder . furthermore , since the attractive rg fixed point ",
