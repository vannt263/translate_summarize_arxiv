    "the inflationary scenario has been established as a standard model for the very early universe not only because it solves the problems of the standard big bang scenario such as the horizon problem , flatness problem and monopole problem , but also because it explains the origin of the almost scale - invariant spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations that seeded the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "in particular , it was shown that the ultra - violet ( uv ) dbi inflation models where a d3 brane is moving down the warped throat is already ruled out by current measurements of the tensor to scalar ratio , the spectral index and non - gaussianity when one applies microphysics constraints on the variation of the inflaton field in a string theory set - up @xcite .",
    "however , in the multi - field dbi models , such stringent constraints can be relaxed .",
    "in fact , dbi inflation is naturally a multi - inflation model as there are six extra dimensions which are the radial direction and five angular directions in the internal space . in multi - field models ,",
    "the trajectory in the field space can have a turn and it converts the entropy perturbations into the curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales @xcite .",
    "it was shown that if there is a sufficient transfer from the entropy perturbations to the curvature perturbation , the constraints on dbi inflation can be significantly relaxed @xcite . however , in order to make definite predictions , it is required to calculate the transfer coefficient explicitly with a concrete multi - field potential .",
