    "stellar oscillation coupled to gravitational waves is one of important issues for the gravitational wave observatories such as ligo , vergo , geo600 and tama .",
    "the current status of these detectors is given elsewhere(e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "detection of gravitational radiation from compact stars would provide valuable information about their interior .",
    "the frequency and damping time are uniquely affected by the stellar structure .",
    "gravitational wave asteroseismology in the future is also discussed(e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "various oscillation modes in neutron stars have been studied theoretically so far , but little is known of the excitation and damping processes .",
    "most likely event that may excite the oscillations is the birth of the neutron stars after supernova .",
    "some oscillation modes may also be induced by instabilities .",
    "an accurate description of these processes requires numerical solution of coupled system of hydrodynamics and the einstein equations .",
    "recently , the numerical simulations have been developing in the several approaches , e.g , 2d newtonian simulation@xcite , 3d smooth particle code simulation@xcite , newtonian mhd simulation@xcite , gr simulation@xcite and the referees therein .",
    "approximate approach is also helpful to get some insight into the physical processes .",
    "for example , excitation of neutron star oscillations in a close binary is studied by using following approximation@xcite .",
    "one of the two stars is an extended body , and the other is approximated by a pointlike particle .",
    "the stellar perturbations in general relativity are solved for the extended body , while the pointlike mass moves on geodesic of the spacetime around the star .",
    "the oscillation mode can be excited by the particle , whose orbit is close enough to satisfy the resonance condition between normal mode frequency of the star and orbital kepler frequency .",
    "detailed discussion concerning excitation of neutron star oscillation in this approach may be found in ref.@xcite and references therein .",
    "this is one of examples showing that oscillations are excited by the external almost periodic disturbance .",
    "the resonant growing mode is in general significantly affected by viscous damping , which may come from physical origins or numerical truncation errors .",
    "it is therefore better to examine resonant property in a simplified model . in this paper",
    ", we consider an idealized situation to study the resonant behavior .",
    "incident gravitational waves are regarded as external periodic disturbance .",
    "the purpose of our study is the following .",
    "what is the resonance condition ?",
    "how does the amplitude grow ?",
    "the external disturbance is characterized by the frequency , duration and amplitude of the waves .",
    "these quantities are closely related with the resonance condition and the amplification of growing mode .",
    "the resonance condition is a relation between intrinsic and external frequencies .",
    "the amplification factor depends on growth rate of the mode and duration of the disturbances .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly summarize the resonance appeared in a harmonics oscillator , which is helpful to examine the stellar model . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider the stellar oscillation with ellipsoidal model under newtonian gravity . the gravitational radiation loss is included by the quadrupole formula .",
    "we show the numerical results in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussion .",
    "we here briefly consider the resonance in a harmonic oscillator , which is a useful model to understand the more realistic case below .",
    "there are two kinds of resonance ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "one type occurs when the frequency @xmath4 of external perturbation matches with the intrinsic frequency @xmath5 , i.e , @xmath6 .",
    "the relevant equation is given by @xmath7 in this case , the amplitude @xmath8 increases linearly with the time , @xmath9 another type of resonance is parametric resonance , which occurs for time - dependent frequency .",
    "one example known as the mathieu s equation is @xmath10 the exponential growth for instability appears when @xmath11 there is allowed range of frequency for each resonance condition , but the width of resonance range decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "the matching for large @xmath12 is hardly satisfied .",
    "the strongest instability occurs for the fundamental one @xmath13 .",
    "therefore the parametric resonance with @xmath13 is very important .",
    "the growth rate @xmath14 in @xmath15 for the fundamental mode can be calculated for small @xmath16 as @xmath17 ^{1/2 } \\sim   \\frac{1}{4 } b   \\omega\\ ] ] for the unstable region @xmath18 in the presence of frictional damping , the amplitude decreases with time as @xmath19 .",
    "the damping counteracts the parametric resonance , so that the condition is more constrained .",
    "the growing solution of the resonance is possible only when @xmath20 exceeds a threshold @xmath21 .",
    "now we consider the pulsation of the star based on newtonian gravity .",
    "the equation of motion for the pulsation driven by external acceleration @xmath22 is @xmath23 as an external perturbation , we consider plane parallel wave with amplitude @xmath0 and angular frequency @xmath24 , propagating along @xmath25-axis .",
    "the tidal acceleration by the incident gravitational wave is expressed as@xcite @xmath26 .",
    "% \\label{incgw}\\ ] ] we here consider + mode only .",
    "another polarization mode @xmath27 is given simply by @xmath28 rotation about @xmath25-axis , and may be ignored without loss of generality .",
    "deceleration due to quadrupole radiation loss is given by@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is five time derivatives of reduced quadrupole moment .",
    "we incorporate both effects by eqs.([incgw ] ) and ( [ gwloss ] ) .",
    "we are interested in global motion of a star , and therefore approximate it by the ellipsoidal model . in the approximation ,",
    "the dynamical motion is limited to uniform expansion and compression along three axes .",
    "thus , the fluid motion is described by three functions of time @xmath31 . the ellipsoidal approximation is often used as a simplified model to extract dynamical features in more realistic cases .",
    "( see e.g , @xcite . )",
    "assuming incompressible fluid with uniform density @xmath32 , the dynamics can be determined by @xmath33 where the function @xmath34 depends on the shape of the ellipsoid , and is described in @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath35 associated with pressure is algebraically determined from the condition @xmath36 the system of eqs.([dyna1.eqn])-([dyna3.eqn ] ) depends on three dimensionless parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is intrinsic frequency of the stellar oscillation , and @xmath40 is damping time due to gravitational radiation .",
    "the amplitude becomes @xmath41 after @xmath42 times oscillations .",
    "these values are physically related with mass @xmath43 and radius @xmath44 of the star as @xmath45    in order to clarify the dynamics of this system , we assume small deviation from spherically symmetric equilibrium ( @xmath46 ) , and linearize eqs.([dyna1.eqn])-([dyna3.eqn ] ) .",
    "we neglect the radiation loss for simplicity and limit the oscillation to the toroidal motion in @xmath47-@xmath48 plane .",
    "the dynamics can be expressed by a single function @xmath8 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the deviations @xmath51 from the equilibrium state : @xmath52 equation ( [ linear.eqn ] ) is the mathieu s one with periodic source term . as considered in section 2 , it is clear that two kinds of resonance are possible in eq.([linear.eqn ] ) , and hence in the system of eqs .",
    "( [ dyna1.eqn])-([dyna3.eqn ] ) . in the astrophysical situation",
    ", periodic external perturbation may be expected , e.g , in close binary system , where the standard resonance due to the periodic driving force is relevant . on the other hand",
    ", we do not definitely know the situation in which the parametric resonance occurs , but the relevant elements may be involved in the complicated system like the hydrodynamical core collapse .",
    "before examining the resonant properties of the system ( [ dyna1.eqn])-([dyna3.eqn ] ) , we first of all show the behavior of non - resonant case .",
    "this is necessary for checking and comparing models . as for initial conditions of numerical calculations",

    "the parameters adopted for the calculation are @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . the damping time @xmath2 of the model corresponds to @xmath61 .",
    "in the early stage of the oscillation , the temporal profiles are a mixture of two modes with frequencies @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "there is a modulation of two modes , which causes larger amplitudes of the oscillations due to interference of two waves .",
    "as the time goes on , the amplitudes of both modes are damped by the radiation loss .",
    "since the external perturbation with @xmath63 is always supplied , the mode becomes dominant around @xmath64 @xmath65 , and the oscillation is eventually enforced to match it at the late phase , typically at several times @xmath40 , as shown in right panel of fig.1 . from the numerical results",
    ", we found that the motion along @xmath66 is also induced by the incompressible condition @xmath67 .",

    ". parameters of the model are @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . from the left to right panels ,",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillations are shown for the early , middle and late stages . ]",
    "we have also calculated the oscillations for different parameters , and found that the general behavior is almost the same unless the resonance condition is satisfied .",
    "the temporal behavior may be easily understood by analyzing the numerical data with fourier transformation .",
    "it is found that the oscillation is approximated by the following curve consisted of two frequencies @xmath70 and @xmath63 : @xmath80 this formula can be derived from the linearized system eq.([linear.eqn ] ) and the accuracy is checked by fitting the numerical results for a wide range of parameters .    in the limit of @xmath81 , the oscillation with @xmath70 in @xmath82 or @xmath83",
    "is completely damped , and the mode matched with the incident wave survives with the amplitude @xmath84 .",
    "the amplitude of the steady state realized at @xmath81 becomes larger when @xmath85 .",

    "the parametric resonance of the fundamental mode can grow up only if the quantity @xmath157 is larger than a critical value @xmath158 . the amplitude of stellar oscillation increases , but is saturated due to non - linear coupling , by which energy is transfered to the additional oscillatory motion .",

    "this corresponds to the situation that duration @xmath162 of the driving source is much larger than radiation damping time @xmath2 , or non - linear time scale @xmath163 .",
    "if this condition does not hold , then the environmental effect would appear first in the evolution .",
    "for example , when the external perturbation stops at @xmath162 , the enhancement by the resonance also stops there , and the amplitude is subsequently damped around @xmath164 .",
    "we now consider the astrophysical relevance of the resonant oscillations .",
    "the f - mode oscillation of a neutron star is estimated as the frequency @xmath165 a few khz , the damping time @xmath166 a few @xmath167 s , and therefore @xmath168 . in this case",
    ", the exotic case needs large amplitude of the gravitational wave @xmath169 the condition is realized only in hydrodynamical regime , e.g , in core collapse of supernova and in the final phase of binary coalescence .",
    "the duration of periodic disturbance is also important factor .",
    "typically , the timescale is of order @xmath170 s , and may be too short for the mode to excited .",
    "anyway , more realistic simulation is needed .",
    "our result may be scaled to the excitation of the f - mode in white dwarfs . in this case , the frequency and damping time are given by @xmath171hz , @xmath172s , and therefore @xmath173 . in this case , the condition for the exotic case becomes less severe @xmath174 .",
