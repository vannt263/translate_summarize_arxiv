    "can be studied using single - molecule junctions , and recently the thermopower of these systems was determined in first experiments.@xcite while the thermopower ( or seebeck coefficient ) of metallic atomic contacts was measured already several years ago,@xcite molecular junctions offer fascinating possibilities to adjust thermoelectric properties due to the control over chemical synthesis and interface structure",
    "and subsequent experimental studies thus explored the influence of different parameters on the thermopower , such as molecule length,@xcite substituents,@xcite anchoring groups,@xcite or electrode metal.@xcite    on the theory side , the electronic contribution to the thermopower explains important experimental observations.@xcite we have shown recently that the thermopower of metallic atomic contacts , which serve as reference systems in molecular electronics , can be understood by considering the electronic structure of disordered junction geometries.@xcite using molecular dynamics simulations of many junction stretching processes combined with tight - binding - based electronic structure and transport calculations , we found thermopower - conductance scatter plots similar to the low - temperature experiment.@xcite such a statistical analysis , although highly desirable for molecular junctions , is complicated by the time - consuming electronic structure calculations needed to describe these heteroatomic systems . still , early studies of the thermopower based on density functional theory ( dft ) for selected geometries explained crucial trends , such as the dependence of the thermopower on molecule length@xcite or the influence of substituents and anchoring groups.@xcite since the experiments on the thermopower of molecular junctions were all performed at room temperature until now , finite temperature effects may play a role .",
    "they can impact the thermopower by fluctuations of the junction geometry and electron - vibration couplings.@xcite while the quantification constitutes an interesting challenge for future work , we will focus here on the purely electronic effects in static ground - state contact structures .",

    "an interesting aspect , not yet addressed in the experiments is the influence of conjugation on the thermopower @xmath0 . for the conductance ,",
    "such studies were carried out by different groups with biphenyl molecules.@xcite the torsion angle @xmath1 between the phenyl rings was adjusted stepwise by use of appropriate side groups . while such substituents may have a parasitic shifting effect on energies of current - carrying molecular orbitals , the changes in conformation , which control the degree of @xmath4-electron conjugation , turned out to dominate the behavior of the conductance.@xcite the systematic series of biphenyl molecules of refs .",
    "uses alkyl chains of various lengths and methyl groups to adjust @xmath1 and avoids strongly electron - donating and electron - withdrawing substituents .",
    "hence it seems ideal for determining the influence of conjugation on thermopower .",
    "theoretical work has considered the behavior of @xmath0 when @xmath1 is changed continuously for the thiolated biphenyl molecule contacted to gold ( au ) electrodes.@xcite both studies agree in the fact that @xmath0 is positive for all @xmath1 .",
    "however , while we predicted @xmath0 to decrease with increasing @xmath1 based on dft calculations and a @xmath4-orbital tight - binding model ( tbm),@xcite work of finch _ _ et al.__@xcite suggested the opposite for this idealized system . in this study",
    "we clarify this contradiction and demonstrate with the help of a two - level model ( 2lm ) that for the off - resonant transport situation the absolute value of @xmath0 is expected to decrease when the molecule changes from planar to perpendicular ring orientation .",
    "this confirms our previous conclusions .",
    "more importantly , this work explores the possibility to measure the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 for the experimentally relevant family of molecules presented in refs .  .",

    "all results exhibit a consistent weak dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 .",
    "the data in table [ tab : tbparams ] shows that transport through the biphenyl molecules is off - resonant with the relation @xmath16 being well fulfilled . as argued in sec .",
    "[ sub : qphi - models ] , @xmath6 should thus take the same sign and change it together with @xmath0 when the transport for s- and nh@xmath10-linked molecules changes from homo- to lumo - dominated for cn anchors .",

    "coming back to our discussion of the differences of the thermopower for the various anchoring groups and binding positions in fig .",
    "[ fig : qphidft ] , we observe that @xmath17 is around 0.6 to 0.8 ev closer to @xmath18 for s - bb and s - tt1 as compared to s - hh , @xmath9-tt1 , and @xmath9-tt2 , which explains their larger @xmath0 . for the cn - terminated molecules @xmath19 is comparable to those for s - bb and s - tt1 .",
    "slightly larger values of @xmath13 for cn result from the very small broadenings @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , for both @xmath9 and cn , @xmath21 and @xmath20 are essentially independent of the binding position , and the difference in @xmath0 between tt1 and tt2 hence stems from the changes in the alignment of the homo and lumo levels .",
    "we have analyzed theoretically the thermopower of single - molecule junctions consisting of biphenyl derivatives contacted to gold electrodes . or dft - based study with the three anchors s , nh@xmath10 , and cn shows a positive thermopower for s or @xmath9 and a negative one for cn . for the junction geometries considered",
    ", different binding sites did not affect the sign of @xmath0 but led to variations of absolute value .",
    "for thiolated molecules in bridge and top binding sites @xmath0 can be up to two orders of magnitude larger than for molecules bonded in hollow position , while the variations for the two considered top binding sites were around a factor of two for @xmath9 and cn anchors .",
    "we have explained these observations by the changes in the level alignment of current - carrying frontier molecular orbitals .",
    "they are caused by the binding - site - dependent charge transfer at the metal - molecule interface .",
    "the main purpose of this work was the study of the dependence of the thermopower on conjugation for an experimentally relevant system .",
    "in our set of six biphenyl derivatives , the conjugation was controlled by the torsion angle @xmath1 between the phenyl ring planes , and it was varied stepwise between @xmath22 and @xmath3 by means of alkyl side chains attached to the molecules . despite the sensitivity of the thermopower to the precise geometry at the molecule - metal interface , we observed for all investigated types of junction configurations a decrease in @xmath13 with increasing @xmath1 , following a characteristic @xmath5 law .",
    "we explained this behavior in terms of a two - level model , which considers the pair of hybridizing frontier orbitals on the phenyl rings .",
    "predictions by this model of a simultaneous change in sign of @xmath23 for a change from homo- to lumo - dominated transport in the off - resonant situation are consistent with our dft results .",
    "overall , the influence of conjugation on the thermopower is much less pronounced than on the conductance .",
    "we propose to measure the @xmath5 dependence of the thermopower for the set of biphenyl molecules studied here .",
    "using alkyl chains of different lengths , parasitic substituent - related shifts in @xmath0 , superimposed on the weak @xmath5 dependence , are largely avoided .",
    "depending on binding site and employed anchoring group , relative variations of @xmath0 of around 15% are expected between m1 and m4 . since frontier molecular orbital energies",
    "are likely positioned closer to @xmath18 in our calculations than in the experiment , the relative changes of @xmath0 with @xmath1 are expected to be somewhat smaller than in our theoretical predictions . nevertheless , we suggest that the variations of the thermopower with torsion angle are experimentally detectable .",
