    "subsequently the running - wave beams were switched on with @xmath199 in order to induce resonant coupling to the @xmath187 and @xmath188 sites .",
    "the induced coupling @xmath200khz was measured independently .",
    "the following rather complex phase evolution can be understood in the limit of @xmath201 , where the dynamics along @xmath20 would be suppressed and the initial state @xmath202 couples to the state @xmath203 , due to the relative phase imprinted by the pair of running - wave beams . in our case",
    "the ratio is @xmath204 leading to a more complex evolution .",
    "we measured the value of the phase as a function of time from the shape of the momentum distribution after time - of - flight .",
    "the method can be explained considering the double - slit interference obtained for an isolated double well along the @xmath20-direction , where we denote the two sites as @xmath205 and @xmath206 , and we consider an arbitrary single - particle state    @xmath207    with phase @xmath208 . the observed density distribution after a sufficiently large @xmath209 is proportional to @xmath210 times an envelope determined by the wannier function , where @xmath211 @xcite . for the initial state @xmath202 , @xmath212 and we expect a symmetric momentum distribution .",
    "a typical image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_phasemeas](b ) . for the following evolution in isolated plaquettes",
    ", we first integrated the momentum distribution along @xmath18 and then determined the phase @xmath213 along @xmath20 .",
    "the result is shown with blue data points in fig .",
    "[ fig_phasemeas](c ) .",
    "for @xmath214 the role of the two running - wave beams is reversed , @xmath215 and the spatial phase pattern induced by the running - wave beams changes sign .",
    "therefore we observed a sign reversal for the phase evolution .",
    "we also observed the dynamics in real space in order to exhibit the influence of the artificial gauge field on the particle flow .",
    "the experimental sequence was the same than the one described above , only the depths of the short lattices were changed to @xmath216 and @xmath150 in order to obtain different coupling strengths @xmath217khz and @xmath218khz . by generalizing the site - resolved detection sequence discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec:32 ] for a system of isolated double wells to plaquettes , we measured the atom population on each site @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "first we applied the non - adiabatic mapping sequence along @xmath18 and @xmath20 in order to transfer the populations @xmath219 to different bloch bands .",
    "atom population originally in @xmath187 sites is therefore transferred to the third energy level in the @xmath18-direction , while population in @xmath189 sites is transferred to the third level along @xmath20 . a subsequent band - mapping technique allowed us then to determine the occupation of different bloch bands by counting the atom numbers in different brillouin zones ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sitesplaq](b ) ) .",
    "the different colors show the connection between brillouin zones and their corresponding lattice sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sitesplaq](a ) ) . a typical image obtained after @xmath221ms of time - of - flight",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sitesplaq](c ) .    from these images we extracted the average atom positions",
    "@xmath222    with @xmath223 being the total atom number .",
    "initially all atoms occupied the @xmath186 and @xmath189 sites with equal weight and the evolution starts at @xmath224 and @xmath225 . after switching on the pair of running - wave beams we observed a coherent particle flow inside the plaquettes towards the @xmath187 and @xmath188 sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_current](b ) ) .",
    "thereafter , the particle current showed deviations along the @xmath20-direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_current](c ) ) , which is reminiscent of the lorentz force acting on a charged particle in a magnetic field . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_current](a ) , the mean atom position followed an orbit that is a small - scale quantum analog of the classical cyclotron orbits for charged particles .",
    "this coherent evolution is damped due to spatial inhomogeneities in the atomic sample .",
    "having independently calibrated the values of @xmath19 and @xmath17 , we fit from the measured atom dynamics the value of the magnetic flux @xmath226 .",
    "the difference from the value @xmath227 expected for a homogeneous lattice stems from the smaller distance between lattice sites inside the plaquettes when separated with an additional superlattice along the @xmath20-direction . for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig_current](a)-(c ) we calculate a distance @xmath228 along @xmath20 yielding @xmath229 , which qualitatively explains the measured flux value .",
    "residual deviations might also be due to an angle mismatch between the two running - wave beams and the lattices beams .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated a new type of optical lattice that realizes strong effective magnetic fields using a method that does not rely on the internal structure of the atom and is therefore applicable to a large variety of different systems .",
    "we have shown that the atomic sample relaxes to the minima of the magnetic bandstructure , realizing an analogue of a frustrated classical spin system .",
    "in addition we have presented a local measurement of the phase acquired by an atom subjected to the photon - assisted tunneling .",
    "furthermore , the quantum cyclotron orbit of single atoms in the lattice has been observed and was used to evaluate the strength of the artificial magnetic field directly .",
    "the spatial average of the magnetic flux , however , is zero , hence the bloch band is topologically trivial @xcite . by using a superlattice potential with more than two non - equivalent sites @xcite or a linear tilt potential @xcite , it is possible to create a lattice with a uniform and non - zero magnetic flux .",
    "this system would realize the harper hamiltonian @xcite and lead to the fractal band structure of the hofstadter butterfly @xcite .",
    "in particular the lowest band would exhibit a chern number of one and be analogous to the lowest landau level @xcite .",
    "in addition the staggered flux lattice can be used to measure the @xmath230-flux associated with a dirac cone using the concept of zak phases following a recent proposal by d.  a.  abanin _ et al .",
    "this method was already demonstrated in the experiment for measuring topological invariants in 1d systems @xcite .",
