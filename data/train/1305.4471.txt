    "a sketch of the experimental set - up is shown in figure [ fig : exp_setup ] .",
    "experiments are performed by drawing a nylon fiber ( radius @xmath1 m ) out of a fluid reservoir at a constant velocity . the reservoir ( a pet tube of length @xmath2 cm with an inner diameter of @xmath3 mm ) contains an aqueous colloidal dispersion of silica particles , ludox hs-40 ( poly - disperse spheres with a radius @xmath4 nm and a volume fraction @xmath5% , purchased from sigma - aldrich ) .",
    "we measured the viscosity @xmath6 mpa.s and the surface tension @xmath7 mn / m . during drying ,",
    "particles concentrate and a gel phase is formed at an ambient relative humidity @xmath8 .",
    "the change in the mechanical properties of the gel is achieved by adding a non - volatile compound to the solvent @xcite .",
    "we choose glycerol for the high miscibility in water and for its low vapor pressure ( @xmath9 mbar at @xmath10c)@xcite . to prepare these solutions , a fraction of ludox solvent is evaporated and replaced by the corresponding mass of glycerol such as the silica mass fraction remains equal to @xmath11% .",
    "the glycerol concentration is calculated from the ratio of the mass of glycerol and the mass of the final solution .",
    "three solutions are studied in this work : @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14% ( wt ) denoted by @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "after pulling the wire , the motor is stopped and observations are made with a microscope lens ( @xmath18 ) adapted to a camera ( avt s marlin ) providing digitized images with a resolution about @xmath19 @xmath0m / pixel . the camera is mounted on a micrometric assembly allowing a precise alignment of the field of view with the film .    2",
    "the initial annular thread coating the fiber can undergo the capillary driven rayleigh - plateau instability and exhibits a regular pattern of drops separated by a thin liquid film @xcite . during the drying process , the material consolidation proceeds and the gel elasticity competes with the instability @xcite .",
    "the evaporation rate @xmath20 is governed by the diffusion - limited transport of water vapor : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the diffusion coefficient of water into air , @xmath23 is the saturation vapor concentration , @xmath24 is the liquid water concentration .",
    "the radius @xmath25 scales the vapor density gradient @xcite .",
    "since the evaporation causes the film thickness to decrease , the particle volume fraction increases as : @xmath26 . for our silica dispersion , both viscoelasticity characterization @xcite and small angle x - ray scattering study @xcite reflect a jamming of the particles for @xmath27 . as a result",
    "we can estimate the consolidation time @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , the instability occurs at a timescale @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the film thickness after coating .",
    "the increase of viscosity due to the drying can be expressed by the krieger - dougherty law : @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xcite . as a result",
    ", @xmath34 yields a critical thickness @xmath35 @xmath0 m below which the instability is inhibited by the drying process .",
    "the final critical film thickness can be evaluated by @xmath36 @xmath0 m which is in a good agreement with experimental observations : this regime is fulfilled for final thicknesses varying in @xmath37 $ ] @xmath0 m for which we obtained weak thickness variations ( @xmath38 @xmath0 m over several centimeters for the highest studied thickness ) .",
    "the aspect ratio of the fiber , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the film length , imposes that the axial stress is larger than the azimuthal stress , thereby leading preferentially to annular cracks formation ( figure [ fig : montage]-a , b , c ) .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : montage]-d , a first annular fracture actually appears on the fiber and then a second at a distance from the first one higher than the typical size @xmath41 , of the zone relieved of stress around a crack .",
    "the third crack will appear preferentially in between the two first ones but defects in the material will induce a dispersion in the positions of the fractures .",
    "thus , the distribution of crack spacing is about conform to the basis expected distribution of a random car parking problem @xcite ( figure [ fig : montage]-d ) .    a typical crack pattern after a complete drying ,",
    "is presented in figure [ fig : montage]-a .",
    "one can note that only one generation of cracks is observed .",
    "we measured approximately @xmath42 crack spacings per film thickness values ( @xmath43 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the thickness @xmath44 of the final material is deduced from the measurements of the diameter of each gel slab .",
    "the mean crack spacing @xmath45 as a function of the dry film thickness , @xmath44 , is reported in figure [ fig : wavelength ] for the three systems prepared with different glycerol concentrations .",
    "the choice of glycerol has been motivated by the results of previous works @xcite as it has been evidenced that glycerol is a good candidate to change the mechanical properties of these systems , keeping a constant surface tension . as expected for open geometries",
    ", it appears that the crack spacing increases linearly with @xmath44 .",
    "the slope of the linear fit depends strongly on the glycerol concentration : an addition of @xmath46 in glycerol leads to an increase in the slope of @xmath47 . in an attempt to link this slope to physical parameters of the material , we consider a one - dimensional model proposed by kitsunezaki which includes the general possibility for the gel to slip on the substrate .",
    "2 by modeling the gel as an isotropic and linear elastic material , kitsunezaki studied the crack spacing resulting from the drying process @xcite .",
    "the author considers an isolated fragment submitted to shrinkage , higher near the interface with air than with the substrate ( which suggests a cross section of a trapezoidal shape , see figure [ fig : montage]-e ) . since the maximum of the tensile stress occurs at the border of the fragment ( point b ) , the possibility of a slipping mechanism at this location is considered rather than a fixed boundary condition ( point a for example ) .",
    "the model suggests then that the fragment starts to slip with the substrate starting from point b , before the fragment is divided with a crack perpendicular to the interfaces .",
    "thus , the cracking mechanism results in the competition between two characteristic stresses : a macroscopic breaking stress above which a crack propagates in the material and the sliding stress .",
    "the friction force @xmath48 of the gel on the fiber is assumed to be constant and can be related to the stress @xmath49 in the material by a shear lag model @xmath50 ; therefore @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the contact sliding length as shown in figure [ fig : montage]-e@xcite . minimizing the elastic energy ,",
    "kitsunezaki derived the largest crack pattern length : @xmath53 .",
    "the relation between the initial thickness @xmath31 and the measured thickness @xmath44 of the dry film is assumed to be @xmath54 .",
    "it results @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the largest predicted crack spacing @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 .",
    "assuming that the mean crack spacing is @xmath58 , this equation becomes :      the experimental data are well fitted by relation ( [ eq : lambda_bar ] ) and the ratio @xmath60 is much larger than one , assuring the model consistency and confirming the sliding motion on the substrate before cracking .    2 from these results , one can estimate the critical stress at cracking provided that the friction stress is known .",
    "frictional responses of a system is a complex problem as it can be considered from different length scales , from macroscopic to molecular contact .",
    "thus , the friction depends in a complicated way of the history of the system , the chemical - physics and the surface properties of the substrate . for all that reasons , measurements of friction force require a high level of expertise @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the present case , the system evolves with time as consolidation proceeds .",
    "thus we recognize that we can provide only an estimation of the gel friction force .",
    "to do so , we use a cantilever technique calibrated by micro indentation testing as shown in figure [ fig : friction]-a .",
    "then , a colloidal drop is deposited with a syringe on a pet slide with an initial contact angle of @xmath61 and an initial volume of @xmath62 . during the drying ,",
    "a solid foot builds up and the center of the drop is a gel - like phase .",
    "after @xmath63 minutes , a slight delamination of the drop foot occurs , preventing the pinning of the contact line while the center is still adhering on the substrate .",
    "the pet slide is then translated quasistatically with a micrometric screw to push the sessile drop to the vertical cantilever figure ( [ fig : friction]-b ) .",
    "thus the highest deflection @xmath64 resulting in the slippage of the drop is measured and the corresponding critical force is deduced .",
    "we assume then that this critical force is the sliding force .",
    "our measurements are well reproducible allowing for a reliable estimation of the friction force @xmath48 .",
    "the experiments were repeated for solutions @xmath65 and @xmath66 giving respectively @xmath67 mn and @xmath68 mn . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the friction force does not depend on glycerol concentration ( for the low glycerol concentrations considered here ) and is comparable to measurements of vigil _ et al .",
    "_ for similar systems of silica gels on hydrophobic surfaces @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath69 mn , we can estimate the breaking stress @xmath70 for each material with equation ( [ eq : lambda_bar ] ) and the experimental data presented in figure [ fig : wavelength ] .",
    "the results are reported in figure [ fig : stress ] showing values between typically @xmath71 to @xmath72 mpa . at a given film thickness ,",
    "the increase of the breaking stress with the glycerol concentration is coherent with a previous study focussed on the influence of a non - volatile compound added to a drying colloidal dispersions on the crack formations @xcite .",
    "this work revealed that due to additional mixing fluxes , the tensile stress responsible for cracks in the material is reduced and leads to an increase of the crack spacing as shown in figure [ fig : wavelength ] .",
    "consequently , the breaking stress which stands for the macroscopic stress applied to the layer to break the material is higher for higher glycerol concentrations .",
    "moreover , for a given system , @xmath70 decreases as the film thickness increases .",
    "man and russel have reported experimental results in accordance with the decrease of @xmath70 in respect of @xmath44 for thick films ( @xmath73 to @xmath74 mm ) of silica and polystyrene particles @xcite . by extrapolating their data for silica particles to the thickness range of our films",
    ", cracking stress is found to be of the order of @xmath71 mpa which is close to our predictions .    to conclude",
    ", we have characterized the annular crack pattern of thin films of colloidal dispersions drying on a fiber .",
    "this open geometry is of particular interest as it displays no boundaries and can be considered as one dimensional .",
    "the spacing of annular cracks evolves linearly with the film thickness and depends on the mechanical properties of the gel .",
    "we have interpreted our data with the kitsunezaki model taking into account the general possibility for the gel to slip on the substrate .",
    "the linear dependence of crack spacing on film thickness is found to be equal to the ratio between the critical cracking stress and the critical slipping stress . from estimations of the friction force of colloidal gels on a hydrophobic substrate",
    ", we deduced the critical macroscopic stress required to break the materials .",
    "further experiments are now required concerning the direct measurements for the sliding force of these materials with hydrophobic surfaces .",

    "<S> this is achieved by considering the drying of a film of silica dispersion coating on a horizontal fiber . in the case of a flat film thickness </S>",
