    "transistor scaling has driven device designs toward thinner channels for better gate control over the channel . 2d materials can provide a shortcut to the ultimate channel thickness scaling : an atomically thin channel .",
    "a tight gate control is important in fets to obtain a 1-to-1 band movement in the channel potential with respect to the gate voltage .",
    "the tight gate control is even more _ crucial _ for the performance of tunnel fets ( tfets ) @xcite since the scaling length and accordingly tunneling distance decreases with a better gate control @xcite . the exponential dependence of the tunneling current on the tunneling distance emphasizes the role of a thin channel and tight gate control in tfets .",
    "some 2d materials , such as graphene or silicene suffer from the lack of a bandgap ( @xmath0 ) and are not suitable for transistor applications . on the other hand , 2d materials such as transition metal dichacogenides ( tmd : mos@xmath1 , wse@xmath1 , mote@xmath1 , etc . )",
    "exhibit a sizable direct bandgap in their monolayer configuration . among those ,",
    "monolayer wte@xmath1 shows particular promise for high performance tfet applications @xcite due to its rather small effective mass and an expected bandgap of about 0.75ev @xcite .",
    "note that a bandgap of about @xmath2 provides the best performance in tfets , where @xmath3 is the supply voltage @xcite , which means that for a @xmath3 of about 0.5v an @xmath0 range of 0.55 - 0.75ev is expected to provide best performance .",
    "unfortunately , however , experiments indicate that the wte@xmath1 2h phase may not be stable @xcite .",
    "this makes it essential to look for other methods for improving the performance of tmd tfets utilizing the existing set of semiconducting tmds .",
    "there are two major methods to create the tunnel junction in these 2d tfets : electrical @xcite and chemical doping @xcite .",
    "the device structure of a chemically doped ( cd ) and electrically doped ( ed ) tfet are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . in the case of cd - tfets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a ) , the tunnel junction is created between a doped source region and the electrostatically gated region .",
    "high doping of the source region fixes the potential at the source side .",
    "increasing the gate voltage can reduce the potential in the channel and create in this way a p - n like tunnel junction . in the case of ed - tfets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b ) , n- and p - type potentials are defined by two gates at the two sides of the tunnel junction and no chemical dopants exist close to the tunnel junction . avoiding chemical doping in the tunnel region",
    "has several advantages .",
    "in particular , it avoids : 1 ) dopant fluctuations and threshold voltage shifts @xcite , 2 ) dopant states within the bandgap which reduce the off - state performance @xcite , and 3 ) the challenging task of chemically doping 2d materials @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "different performance boosters for chemically and electrically doped 2d tfets are discussed in detail .",
    "first , atomistic quantum transport simulations from nemo5 tool @xcite have been used to investigate the impact of strain , source doping level , and equivalent oxide thickness ( eot ) .",
    "later on , an analytic model is used to explain the trends .",

    "hence , monolayer wse@xmath1 is chosen for our atomistic simulations and the detailed analysis of various performance boosters .",
    "the wse@xmath1 hamiltonian employs an sp@xmath5d@xmath6 2nd nearest neighbor tight - binding ( tb ) model .",
    "the semi - empirical tb parameters are optimized based on first principles bandstructures ( e - k ) calculated from density functional theory ( dft ) with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite . a similar tb parameter fitting procedure based on dft e - k has been used in the presence of strain .",
    "dft - gga has been chosen since it provides band gaps and effective masses in tmds comparable to experimental measurements @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "self - consistent poisson - negf ( non - equilibrium green s function ) methodology has been employed within the tight - binding description . because in - plane and out - of - plane dielectric constants ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) of wse@xmath1 are different , the poisson equation reads as follows @xcite if the z direction is considered to be along the c - axis of the tmds : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electrostatic potential and total charge , respectively .",
    "the dielectric constant values ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) of wse@xmath1 are taken from ab - initio studies @xcite . in this work ,",
    "quantum transport simulations have been performed with our simulation tool nemo5 @xcite .",
    "in spite of the similarities between cd - tfets and ed - tfets , they obey rather different scaling rules and design guidelines @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the impact of the various performance boosters in cd - tfets and ed - tfets in the following sections .    0.4   tfet with eot=2 nm ( black curve ) , eot=0.45 nm ( blue curve ) , doping level of 2e20 @xmath4 ( pink curve ) , and biaxial strain of 3% ( red curve ) .",

    "eot is decreased to 0.45 nm ( blue curve ) . in the second step ,",
    "the doping level is increased to 2e20 @xmath4 ( pink curve ) , and finally a biaxial strain of 3% is applied to wse@xmath1 ( red curve ) .",
    "the bandgap and effective mass of monolayer wse@xmath1 decreases by application of biaxial strain ; e.g. 3% biaxial strain reduces the reduced effective mass @xmath13 and the band gap @xmath0 by about 10% and 22% , respectively .",

    "about 3 orders of magnitude increase in i@xmath20 and a factor of 3 reduction in ss are obtained combining the performance boosters .",

    "each gate has a length of 12 nm and v@xmath32 is set to 0.5v in all ed - tfet simulations .",
    "the major players affecting the performance of ed - tfets are : 1 ) the spacing between the gates : @xmath23 ( fig .",

    "the y - axis shows the impact of the bending distance @xmath14 which has one main component : the scaling length of the gated region ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "notice that the expression for @xmath16 is different in ed - tfets if compared with cd - tfets .",
    "decreasing @xmath25 , @xmath30 , and @xmath23 reduces @xmath16 and @xmath14 and increases i@xmath37 .",
    "if another material with smaller @xmath0 and @xmath38 ( e.g. wte@xmath1 ) is used instead of wse@xmath1 , the arrows would shift to the left and a higher on - current could be achieved .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] shows how the off - state performance of the 2d ed - tfets gets affected by different design parameters .",
    "it is apparent that both ss and i@xmath20 significantly improve using a thinner oxide , smaller spacing , and a smaller spacer dielectric constant .",
    "the most effective improvement comes from a smaller spacer dielectric constant and thinner oxide which increases i@xmath20 by more than 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "one of the main differences between 2d cd - tfets and ed - tfets is that the concept of eot is not applicable to ed - tfets . in the case of ed - tfets ,",
    "the electric field at the tunnel junction ( @xmath39 ) is inversely proportional to the total thickness of the device ( including top and bottom oxides ) @xcite : @xmath40 this point is usually ignored in the design of electrically doped devices ; a common layout uses a thick back oxide which leads to a small @xmath39 .",
    "this problem can be overcome by using a back oxide with low dielectric constant compared to the top oxide ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "[ fig : fig7]b shows the potential profile of an electrically doped tfets with thin and thick back oxides with high - k dielectric on the top and bottom .",
    "it is apparent that a thick back oxide increases the potential spread and reduces @xmath39 .",
    "[ fig : fig7]c shows that a low - k dielectric back gate can reduce the impact of thick back gate oxide significantly .",
    "hence , @xmath42 these results suggests that if a thin back oxide with gates aligned with the top gates is experimentally challenging , one can use a low - k back oxide to avoid performance degradation and enhance fabrication feasibility .",
    "there are two main differences between @xmath14 of cd - tfets and ed - tfets : 1 ) the expression for the scaling length @xmath16 @xcite and 2 ) @xmath16 replaces @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "the constant i@xmath19 plot of the wse@xmath1 ed - tfet is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] .",
    "in conclusion , important design parameters of 2d cd- and ed - tfets are discussed here . it is shown that the eot and source doping ( @xmath18 ) are the main players in the case of cd - tfets , whereas the performance of ed - tfets mainly depends on @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
