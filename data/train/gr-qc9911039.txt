    "in the last few years the chaotic regime in dynamics of closed frw universe filled with a scalar field becomes the issue of investigations .",
    "initially , the model with a massive scalar field ( with the scalar field potential @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mass of the scalar field ) was studied @xcite . before summarizing main results obtained , we present the equation of motion ( for further using we will not specify the potential @xmath4 ) .",
    "the system has two dynamical variables - the scale factor @xmath5 and the scalar field @xmath6 : @xmath7 @xmath8 with the first integral @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the planck mass .",
    "the points of maximal expansion and those of minimal contraction , i.e. the points , where @xmath11 can exist only in the region where @xmath12 sometimes , the region defined by inequalities ( 4 ) is called the euclidean one .",
    "one can easily see also that the possible points of maximal expansion ( where @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) are localized inside the region @xmath15 while the possible points of minimal contraction ( where @xmath13 , @xmath16 ) lie outside this region ( 5 ) being at the same time inside the euclidean region ( 4 ) .",
    "the main idea of the further analysis @xcite consists in the fact that in the closed isotropical model with a minimally coupled scalar field satisfying the energodominance condition all the trajectories have the point of maximal expansion .",
    "then the trajectories can be classified according to localization of their points of maximal expansion .",
    "the area of such points is specified by ( 5 ) .",
    "a numerical investigation shows that this area has a quasi- periodical structure , wide zones corresponding to the falling to singularity being intermingled with narrow those in which the points of maximal expansion of trajectories having the so called `` bounce '' or point of minimal contraction are placed .",
    "then studying the substructure of these zones from the point of view of possibility to have two bounces one can see that this substructure reproduce on the qualitative level the structure of the whole region of possible points of maximal expansion .",
    "continuing this procedure _ ad infinitum _ yields the fractal set of infinitely bouncing trajectories .",
    "it should be noticed that even the 1-st order bounce intervals ( containing maximum expansion points for trajectories having at least one bounce ) are very narrow .",
    "analytical approximation for large initial @xmath5 indicates that the width of intervals is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath5 @xcite . the opposite case of small initial @xmath5 was investigated numerically , and the ratio of the first such interval width to the distance between intervals appear to be of the order of @xmath17 , if we do not take into account zigzag - like trajectories .",
    "so , the chaotic regime , though being interesting from the mathematical point of view , may be treated as not important enough .    for steeper potentials",
    "the chaos is even less significant .",
    "the chaotic behavior may disappear completely for exponentially steep potentials @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to describe the opposite case - the potentials which is less steep than the quadratic one .",
    "we will see that in this case the transition to a qualitatively stronger chaos may occur .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "it sec.2 we consider asymptotically flat potential and explain new features of the chaos which give rise in this case . in sec.3 a more wide class of potentials less steep than quadratic is studied . in sec.4",
    "we discuss the transition to regular dynamics in the presence of ordinary matter in addition to the scalar field for potentials under consideration .",
    "we will use the units in which @xmath18 for presenting our numerical results , because in these units most of the interesting events occur for the range of parameters of the order of unity .",
    "we start with the potential @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are parameters .",
    "@xmath20 determines the asymptotical value of the potential for @xmath22 .",
    "it can be easily checked from the equations of motion that multiplying the potential to a constant ( i.e. changing the @xmath20 ) leads only to rescaling @xmath5 .",
    "so , this procedure do not change the chaotic properties of our dynamical system . on the contrary , this system appear to be very sensitive to the value of @xmath21 .",
    "we plotted in fig.1 .",
    "the @xmath23 cross - section of bounce intervals depending on @xmath21 .",
    "this plot represents a situation , qualitatively different from studied previously for potentials like @xmath24 and steeper .",
    "namely , the bounce intervals can merge .",
    "=    let us see more precisely what does it means . for @xmath25",
    "the picture is qualitatively as for a massive scalar field - trajectories from 1-st interval have a bounce with no @xmath6-turns before it , trajectories which have initial point of maximal expansion between 1-st and 2-nd intervals fall into a singularity after one @xmath6-turn , those from 2-nd interval have a bounce after 1 @xmath6-turn and so on . for @xmath21 a bit smaller than the first merging value the 2-nd interval contains trajectories with 2 @xmath6-turns before bounce , the space between 1-st interval ( which is now the product of two merged intervals ) and the 2-nd one contains trajectories falling into a singularity after two @xmath6-turns .",
    "there are no trajectories going to a singularity with exactly one @xmath6-turn .",
    "trajectories from the 1-st interval can experience now a complicated chaotic behavior which can not be described in as similar way as above .    with @xmath21 decreasing further , the process of interval merging being to continue leading to growing chaotisation of trajectories .",
    "when @xmath26 intervals merged together , only trajectories with at least @xmath26 oscillations of the scalar field before falling into a singularity are possible .",
    "those having exactly @xmath26 @xmath6-turns have their initial point of maximal expansion between 1-st bounce interval and the 2-nd one ( it now contains trajectories having a bounce after @xmath26 @xmath6-turns ) . for initial values of the scale factor larger then those from the 2-nd interval , the regular quasiperiodic structure described above is restored .",
    "numerical analysis shows also that the fraction of very chaotic trajectories as a function of @xmath21 grows rapidly with @xmath21 decreasing below the first merging value . to illustrate this point we plotted in fig.2 the number of trajectories which do not fall into a singularity during first @xmath27 oscillations of the scalar field @xmath6 .",
    "we do not include trajectories with the next point of maximal expansion located outside the 2-nd ( or the 1-st one , if merging occurred ) interval , so all counted trajectories avoid a singularity during this sufficiently long time interval due to their extreme chaoticity , but not due to reaching the slow - roll regime .",
    "the initial value of @xmath5 vary in the range of the first two intervals before and after merging with the step @xmath28 . before merging ,",
    "the measure of so chaotic trajectories is extremely low and they are undistinguisheble on our grid .",
    "when @xmath21 becomes slightly low than the value of the first merging , this number begin to grow rather rapidly and for @xmath29 near @xmath30 of trajectories from the 1-st interval experience at least 50 oscillation before falling into a singularity .",
    "=    we recall that for a simple massive scalar field potential only @xmath31 trajectories in the same range of the initial scale factors have at least one bounce .",
    "fraction of trajectories not falling into a singularity after only one bounce is about one hundred times less and so on .",
    "the common numerical calculation accuracy is unsufficient for distinguishing even the sole trajectory with 50 oscillations and @xmath5 being in the range of first two intervals .",
    "in contrast to this , the chaos for the potential ( 6 ) is really significant .",
    "detail of intervals merging including the description out of @xmath23 cross - section require further analysis .    for large initial @xmath5",
    "the configuration of bounce intervals for potential ( 6 ) looks like the configuration for a massive scalar field potential with the effective mass easily derived from ( 6 ) : @xmath32 .",
    "the periods of corresponding structures coincides with a good accuracy though the widths of the intervals for the potential ( 6 ) is bigger then for @xmath33 .",
    "the very chaotic regime described above is possible also for potentials , which are not asymptotically flat , if the potential growth is slow enough .",
    "we will illustrate this point describing a particular ( but rather wide ) family of potentials having power - low behavior ",
    "damour - mukhanov potentials @xcite .",
    "they was originally introduced to show a possibility to have an inflation behaviour without slow - roll regime .",
    "after , various issues on inflationary dynamics @xcite and growth of perturbation @xcite for this kind of scalar field potential was studied .",
    "the explicit form of damour - mukhanov potential is @xmath34,\\ ] ] with three parameters @xmath20 , @xmath35 and @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath36 the potential looks like the massive one with the effective mass @xmath37 . in the opposite case of large @xmath6",
    "it grows like @xmath38 .    as in the previous section ,",
    "the chaotic behavior does not depend on @xmath20 .",
    "so , we have a two - parameter family of potentials with different chaotic properties .",
    "numerical studies with respect to possibility of bounce intervals merging shows the following picture ( see fig.3 ) : for a rather wide range of @xmath35 there exists a corresponding critical value of @xmath21 such that for @xmath21 less than critical , the very chaotic regime exists .",
    "increasing @xmath35 corresponds to decreasing critical @xmath21 .",
    "=    surely , since this regime is absent for quadratic and more steep potentials , @xmath35 must at least be less than @xmath39 .",
    "we can see clearly the very chaotic regime for @xmath40 .",
    "the case @xmath41 lead to strong chaos for @xmath42 and the critical @xmath21 decreases with increasing @xmath35 very sharply at this point .",
    "we did not investigated further these extremely small values of @xmath21 , because the physical meaning of such kind of potential is very doubtful .",
    "in this section we add the perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath43 .",
    "the equation of motion are now @xmath44 @xmath45 with the constraint @xmath46 here @xmath47 , @xmath48 is a constant from the equation of motion for matter which can be integrated in the form @xmath49    in ref.@xcite it was shown that addition of a hydrodynamical matter to the scalar field with a potential @xmath50 can kill the chaos . here",
    "we extend this analysis to less steep potentials .",
    "some of our results are illustrated in fig.4 .",
    "it is interesting that increasing @xmath48 acts as increasing @xmath21 . in fig.4",
    "three intervals merged at @xmath51 . when @xmath48 increases , the 3-d and 2-nd interval consecutively separate and we return to the chaos typical for @xmath50 . with the further increasing of @xmath48",
    "the chaos disappear in a way discussed in @xcite .    =    the value of @xmath48 corresponding to the chaos disappearing is in general bigger for the less steep potentials with the same effective mass . in fig.5.(a )",
    "this values are plotted for damour - mukhanov potentials and the perfect fluid with @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this particular @xmath54 is chosen for a mathematical reason .",
    "namely , it can be seen from ( 8)-(10 ) that in this case only the constraint equation is changed in comparison with the initial system ( 1)-(3 ) . in other words ,",
    "dynamical equations describing frw universe with a scalar field and dust matter are formally equivalent to those for scalar field only but with nonzero value of the conserved energy .",
    "so , our figure describes not only the physical system under consideration , but also general mathematical properties of ( 1)-(2 ) .",
    "we recall that for the case @xmath50 ( which is equivalent to the damour - mukhanov potential with @xmath55 , the corresponding mass is equal to the effective one @xmath37 ) the chaos disappear for @xmath56 @xcite . to compare with this value , we plotted in fig.5(a ) the values of @xmath57 leading to ceasing of the chaos with respect to @xmath21 for several @xmath35 . in units we used the case",
    "@xmath55 corresponds to horizontal line @xmath58 .",
    "all other curves have this value as an asymptotic one for large @xmath21 .",
    "with decreasing @xmath21 the value @xmath57 increases with the rate which is bigger for less steep potentials .",
    "=    in fig.5(b ) the analogous curve is plotted for asymptotically flat potential ( 6 ) .",
    "the value @xmath57 for large @xmath21 is the same . for small @xmath21 we can estimate @xmath48 killing the chaos as the value corresponding to disappearance of the euclidean region for a flat potential @xmath59 .",
    "it can be easily obtained from ( 4 ) that in this case the euclidean region disappears at @xmath60 and for bigger @xmath48 any bounce become impossible .",
    "as the potential ( 6 ) differs significantly from the flat one only for @xmath6 less then @xmath21 , this approximation appear to be good enough for small @xmath21 . in the our units it correspond to the curve @xmath61 .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath21 represent smooth transition between these two asymptotic behaviors .",
