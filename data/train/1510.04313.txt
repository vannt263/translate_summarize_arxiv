    "however , these signatures do not eliminate the possibility that some of these grains were produced in supernovae , and further isotopic signatures would help to distinguish between nova and supernova origins @xcite .    work is being done to measure sulfur isotopic ratios in presolar grains ; contamination of the grains by the sulfuric acid used to isolate them has been a major issue that is being overcome @xcite .",
    "recent experimental @xcite and modeling @xcite work has been done to constrain the expected @xmath21s/@xmath22s ratio for nova grains to a range of 110 - 130 , which distinguishes it from the supernova predictions .",

    "previous measurements of @xmath2ar levels within the region of astrophysical interest were limited and had excitation energy uncertainties of 10  kev or greater .",

    "our measured level density is consistent with the level density predicted by the shell model , indicating that we have likely discovered most of the @xmath2ar states in the region of interest . in one of the bins , our level density is slightly higher than the predicted one , but this can be explained by the several - hundred kev uncertainties of the shell - model energies .",
