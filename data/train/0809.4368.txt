    "the field evolved rapidly in the recent decade .",
    "thus the many facets of experimental ion trap quantum computing and its techniques can not be covered all .",
    "instead , we want to present here a coherent picture of the most important experimental issues and refer the reader to the original publications for the details .",
    "we also describe some of the milestones achieved so far in ion trap quantum computing , like teleportation of quantum states and quantum error correction .",
    "still much of the work especially towards shuttling ions with segmented traps is only touched upon .    a quantum computer uses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve certain mathematical problems faster than normal computers . such a quantum computer processes quantum information whose most basic unit is called a quantum bit ( qubit ) .",
    "already a small quantum computer , consisting of forty qubits complex numbers are necessary .",
    "already this requirement exceeds the capacities of current super computers .",
    "] , could solve quantum mechanical problems that are intractable with current computers .",
    "in particular , the study of quantum mechanical many body systems would benefit considerably from such a device @xcite . in 1989",
    ", david deutsch discovered a mathematical problem which can be solved faster with quantum mechanical means than with classical ones @xcite .",
    "but it was a few years later when the rapid development of quantum computation set in , marked by peter shor s discovery of a quantum algorithm with which large numbers can be factored much faster than with today s classical algorithms @xcite .    shortly afterwards ,",
    "ignacio cirac and peter zoller found a physical system on which such quantum algorithms could be implemented @xcite : single trapped ions were supposed to carry the quantum information , which is manipulated and read out with focused laser beams . already within a year s time , david wineland s group at national institute of standards and technology demonstrated the heart of such an ion - trap quantum computer @xcite , a controlled bit flip on a single ion . without exaggeration",
    "one can say that those two publications mark the birth of experimental quantum computation .",
    "rapidly also other implementations were considered . in particular , liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance was used to demonstrate a quantum algorithm @xcite and later even shor s algorithm was implemented on a seven qubit register @xcite . on the theoretical side , many new interesting implications were found . for quantum computation ,",
    "the most relevant implication was the discovery of quantum error correction protocols by peter shor @xcite and andrew steane @xcite .",
    "these protocols allow for the implementation of arbitrary long quantum algorithms without perfect control .",
    "the basic unit of quantum information ( a qubit ) can be implemented with a two - level system such as the electron s spin in a magnetic field or using two levels of an atom .",
    "a simple quantum computation initializes the qubits , manipulates them and finally reads out the final states .",
    "any physical implementation of quantum computation must be able to perform these tasks .",
    "thus the physical system must satisfy the requirements laid out in sec .",
    "[ sec : divincenzo - criteria ] to qualify as a universal quantum computer @xcite .    1 .",
    "it must be a scalable physical system with well characterized qubits .",
    "2 .   it must be possible to initialize the qubits .",
    "3 .   the qubits must have a coherence time much longer than the operation time .",
    "there has to be a universal set of quantum gates . in the most simple case one",
    "considers single - qubit and entangling two - qubit gates .",
    "a qubit - specific measurement must be attainable .",
    "furthermore , to build up a quantum network , one requires :    1 .   the ability to interconvert stationary and flying qubits .",
    "2 .   the ability to faithfully transmit flying qubits between specified locations .    in principle",
    ", these requirements can be fulfilled with a number of physical approaches , like nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity - qed ) @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite , a combination of circuit - qed and josephson junctions @xcite and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "methods using linear optics have also been proposed @xcite and actually were used for quantum information processing @xcite , however , here the emphasis is naturally more on the transmission of quantum information rather than processing it .    using nuclear magnetic resonance , quite a number of impressive demonstration experiments",
    "have been performed .",
    "unfortunately , the state of the quantum register ( molecules ) can only be poorly initialized ( except in special cases @xcite ) , making the scaling properties of nmr quantum computation not very promising @xcite . at the moment",
    "josephson junctions seem to be very appealing , especially when combined with superconducting strip line cavities @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated bell - states and a controlled - not , respectively , with pairs of josephson junction qubits .",
    "of the many approaches that have been proposed for constructing a quantum computer , trapped ions are currently one of the most advanced @xcite .",
    "this is also reflected in the fact that around the year 2000 only half a dozen groups pursued experimental ion - trap quantum computing while in 2008 there are more than 25 groups working in the field .",
    "already long before the idea of quantum computation was picked up by experimentalists , four out of the five core criteria required by divincenzo for a quantum computer were demonstrated with trapped ions in the laboratory : initialization @xcite and read - out of the internal electronic states of trapped ions @xcite , extremely long coherence times @xcite and laser cooled ion crystals with many ions @xcite serving as a qubit register",
    ". then @xcite realized that a quantum computation can be carried out by coupling the ions via a collective motional degree of freedom .",
    "thus , a route to implement the missing conditional evolution of physically separated qubits ( a two - qubit interaction ) was introduced .",
    "in addition they proved that the size of the resources necessary to control trapped ions does not increase exponentially with the number of qubits @xcite .",
    "soon after the proposal by cirac and zoller in 1995 , the nist ion storage group around david wineland implemented the key idea of the proposal a conditioned phase shift with a single be@xmath0-ion @xcite .",
    "furthermore they demonstrated a few other two - qubit gate candidates @xcite , entangled up to four ions @xcite , demonstrated a so - called decoherence free subspace @xcite and simulated a nonlinear beam - splitter @xcite .    in our group in innsbruck ,",
    "the deutsch - josza algorithm was demonstrated with a single ca@xmath0-ion @xcite , followed by the first implementation of a set of universal gates on a two - ion string @xcite .",
    "in addition , the creation of various entangled states and the partial read - out of an entangled quantum register was demonstrated @xcite .",
    "further milestones in ion - trap quantum computing were experiments on quantum teleportation by both groups @xcite , an error correction protocol by the nist - group @xcite , entanglement of six and eight particles @xcite by both groups , respectively and entanglement purification @xcite .",
    "recently , ions in separate traps have been also entangled using ion - photon entanglement by the ann - arbor group @xcite .",
    "currently , miniaturization and integration of segmented ion traps is rapidly progressing .",
    "already for some time , the nist group has been successfully using microfabricated segmented traps to relieve the difficulties of single ion addressing .",
    "inspired by this success , in the mean time virtually all ion trap groups started to develop segmented trap technologies .",
    "furthermore , u.s .",
    "funding bodies initiated contacts between the various groups to further ion trap related technologies and established contacts to microfabrication laboratories , such as lucent technologies and sandia national laboratories . in europe the specific targeted research project microtraps with six participating groups has been formed to further microfabricated ion trap technologies .      a excellent overview and detailed account of the fundamental issues of ion trap quantum computing is given by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite review the progress towards the manipulation and control of single ions .",
    "very recently , the generation and applications of entangled ions were reviewed by @xcite .",
    "we start here by summarizing how ion - trap quantum computers fulfill the divincenzo criteria mentioned above @xcite :    1 .   *",
    "a scalable physical system with well characterized qubits : * long - lived internal levels of the ions serve as the qubits ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : ion - qubits ] ) .",
    "the qubit register is formed by strings of ions in a ( linear ) trap . while this approach is in principle scalable , it is desirable to distribute the ions among multiple traps @xcite ) . thus complications , due to the increased mass and more the complicated mode structure of large ion strings can be circumvented .",
    "first steps in this direction will be briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : scaling ] .",
    "the ability to initialize the state of the qubits : * this is most easily achieved by optical pumping to a well - defined electronic state .",
    "fidelities of 0.99 are typical , in sec .",
    "[ sec : optical - pumping ] also methods to achieve much higher fidelities will be discussed .",
    "* a coherence time much longer than the operational time : * in current quantum computing experiments , typically coherence times of a few milliseconds are achieved which are about one to two orders of magnitude longer than the time scale for quantum operations ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : decoherence ] for details ) . the coherence time is often limited by magnetic field fluctuations . on the other hand coherence times of more than 10  s",
    "have been demonstrated with raman - transitions between magnetic - field insensitive transitions @xcite .",
    "similar observations were made in @xmath1ca@xmath0 by the oxford and innsbruck groups @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite demonstrated a coherence time of more than 10 minutes using a microwave drive instead of a raman - laser setup .",
    "however , so far only one experiment demonstrated the combination of high - fidelity quantum gates and magnetic field insensitive transitions @xcite .",
    "4 .   * a universal set of quantum gates : * 1 .",
    "single qubit gates are implemented by driving rabi oscillations between the two qubit levels with resonant laser pulses ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : single - qubit - gates ] ) .",
    "the gates can be represented as rotations of the bloch sphere where the axis of rotation can be selected by changing the phase of the exciting laser field ( single photon transition ) or the phase difference of the two raman beams ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : single - qubit - gates ] ) . a single - qubit phase - gate can be produced directly by an off - resonant laser via an ac - stark shift ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : single - qubit - gates ] ) .",
    "2 .   for two - qubit gates usually",
    "the long range interaction due to the coulomb force is employed . in the original proposal by cirac and zoller ,",
    "the quantum information of one ion is swapped to the common motional degree of freedom of the ion string @xcite .",
    "then an operation conditioned on the motional state can be carried out on a second ion before the quantum information is swapped back from the motion to the first ion . section  [ sec : two - qubit - gates ] details this idea as well as other methods to implement multi - qubit gates .",
    "implementations of some of the two - qubit gate recipes will be discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : cz - experiments ] and [ sec : entangled - states ] . 5 .   * a qubit - specific measurement : * one of the qubit levels is excited on a strong transition to a higher lying auxiliary short - lived level while the other qubit level remains untouched .",
    "thus , fluorescence from the decay is detected only if the qubit is projected to the qubit level which is coupled to the auxiliary transition ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : state - detection ] ) .",
    "additionally divincenzo requires :    1 .   *",
    "the ability to interconvert stationary and flying qubits : * ions can be stored in a high - finesse cavity .",
    "thus , the ions internal state can be mapped onto a photonic state @xcite .",
    "the ability to faithfully transmit flying qubits between specified locations : * a photon can be transmitted through a fiber and at the target location coupled via another high - finesse cavity to the target ion .",
    "there exist further possibilities to connect two distant ion trap quantum computers .",
    "one of them will be briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : entanglement - purification ] .    for practical applications ,",
    "the divincenzo criteria have not only to be fulfilled , but also the fidelity and speed of the implementations have to be considered ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : threshold ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it is highly desirable to implement all operations as parallel as possible .      we will now briefly discuss the hamiltonian of two - level systems interacting with a quantized harmonic oscillator via laser light . for more detailed discussions , we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the basic level scheme of such a system is displayed in fig .",

    "@xmath5 characterizes the strength of the laser field in terms of the so - called rabi frequency , @xmath15 denotes the phase of the field with respect to the atomic polarization and @xmath16 is the laser - atom detuning .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the trap frequency , @xmath17 is the lamb - dicke parameter with @xmath18 being the projection of the laser field s wavevector along the @xmath10 direction and @xmath19 is the spatial extension of the ion s ground state wave function in the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath20 is here the ion s mass ) .",
    "we mention also that the rotating wave approximation has been applied which assumes that both the laser detuning and rabi frequency are much smaller than optical frequencies .",
    "a similar treatment can be carried out for qubits based on raman - transitions by eliminating the virtual level through which the two qubits are coupled .",
    "please note that in our definition the rabi frequency measures the frequency with which the population is exchanged in contrast to the definition used by @xcite and @xcite .    using the lamb - dicke approximation ( @xmath21 ) which is almost always valid for cold tightly bound ion strings , we can rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : ion - trap - hamiltonian ] @xcite : @xmath22 three cases of the laser detuning @xmath16 are of particular interest ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ion - tensor - oscillator ] ) : @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this becomes apparent if a second rotating wave approximation is carried out where it is assumed that only one transition is relevant at a time .",
    "discarding time dependent terms , we thus arrive at    1 .",

    "we define the blue sideband rabi frequency @xmath30 which describes the flopping frequency between the @xmath31 and the @xmath32 state .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the red sideband transition ( @xmath33 ) @xmath34 simultaneously to exciting the electronic state , here a phonon is destroyed and rabi flopping with the rabi frequency @xmath35 takes place .",
    "naturally , one is interested in driving the sideband transitions as fast as possible to speed up the quantum operations based on the sideband transitions .",
    "however , especially for small lamb - dicke factors , the second rotating wave approximation performed to obtain eqs .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian - carrier]-[eq : hamiltonian - red ] is then not satisfied for rabi frequencies @xmath5 comparable to the trap frequency @xmath9 : as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ eq : blue - rabi - frequency ] for ions in the motional ground state , the carrier transition is stronger by a factor of @xmath36 as compared to the sideband transitions .",
    "therefore , driving the weak sideband transitions with strong laser fields , stark shifts and off - resonant excitations arise @xcite .",
    "for example , to achieve a side - band rabi frequency @xmath37 of a fraction @xmath38 of the trap frequency @xmath9 , we need a laser field of strength @xmath39 .",
    "the stark shift @xmath40 of the qubit transition due to the presence of the carrier transition is given by @xmath41 the phase evolution @xmath42 due to the ac - stark shift becomes comparable to the desired rabi flopping with frequency @xmath37 already for [ sec : ac - stark - limit ] @xmath43 and thus typically for @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "similarly , off - resonant excitations on the carrier transition might spoil the fidelity in this regime .",
    "in particular , rabi oscillations on the carrier transition occur with amplitude @xmath46 @xcite @xmath47 where we assumed @xmath48 , which is justified by the conclusions from eq .",
    "[ eq : carrier - stark - shift ] . both the ac - stark shift and the off - resonant excitations , can be at least partially canceled with methods described in sec .",
    "[ sec : imperfect - control ] .",
    "however , it still remains very difficult to drive rabi flops on sidebands much faster than @xmath49 .",
    "thus , it is hard to implement a two - qubit gate based on sideband transitions within one trap period .",
    "a good qubit candidate must meet certain criteria . in the case of trapped ions",
    "it is usually sufficient to concentrate on long coherence times on the qubit transition compared with the manipulation times and on the technical feasibility of the required lasers .",
    "the scale to which the coherence time has to be compared with is given by the gate operation times of typically @xmath50s ( c.f .",
    "fig  [ fig : time - scales ] ) .     currently achieved time scales in ion trap quantum computing .",
    "all operations can be implemented faster than the relevant decoherence mechanisms.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    [ sec : ion - qubits ] currently two different schemes are used to store quantum information in trapped ions : in the first scheme , superpositions between the electronic ground state and an excited metastable electronic state provide the two - level system ( optical qubit ) ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : qubits]a and [ fig : ca-40-level - scheme ] ) .",
    "the excited @xmath51-level in ca@xmath0 similarly to sr@xmath0 and ba@xmath0 has a life time of more than one second @xcite . in a second scheme ,",
    "even larger coherence times can be achieved with superpositions encoded in the electronic ground - state of the ions ( radio - frequency qubits ) ( see fig .  [",

    "the lifetimes of these states are estimated to be much larger than any currently experimentally relevant timescales .",
    "generic level schemes of atoms for optical qubits ( left ) and radio - frequency qubits ( right ) .",
    "in addition to the two qubit levels @xmath52 usually a third rapidly decaying level is used for laser cooling and state read - out . while the optical qubit is typically manipulated on a quadrupole transition , the radio - frequency qubit levels are connected with raman - transitions.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    there are different aspects to be considered for optical and and radio - frequency qubits : to fully exploit the potential of the optical qubit provided by the @xmath53 and @xmath51-level in ca@xmath0 , a laser line width of less than @xmath54  mhz is required .",
    "this fractional stability of about @xmath55 is technically quite demanding , however , it has already been implemented for metrology purposes @xcite .",
    "the transition frequencies for radio - frequency qubits are usually below 10  ghz .",
    "thus it is much easier to get the required stable phase reference .",
    "radio - frequency qubits can be manipulated either directly by microwaves @xcite or as it is usually the case by a raman - process @xcite .",
    "here , a single atom absorbs a photon from one laser field and emits a second one into a second laser field .",
    "the frequency difference of the two laser fields provides the necessary energy for the population transfer and thus only this frequency difference is important .",
    "the two laser fields are either derived from the same laser or a phase locking between two lasers can be implemented without resorting to optical frequency standards . using optical fields instead of microwaves has the advantage that a much better spatial concentration of the power can be achieved and much higher rabi - frequencies can be attained as with microwaves .",
    "furthermore , by driving radio - frequency qubits optically with two anti - parallel beams , two photons can transfer their recoil onto the atom .",
    "thus , the coupling to the ion motion is increased as compared to single photon transitions ( larger lamb - dicke factors @xmath7 ) and as a consequence the speed of two - qubit gates can be higher .",
    "choosing co - propagating beams , the coupling to the motion can be inhibited efficiently which has the benefit of suppressing the sensitivity to the ion motion .    for optical as well as for rf - qubits , the coherence times",
    "are often limited by fluctuations of the magnetic fields .",
    "the reason is that usually the qubit basis states employed have different magnetic moments such that they experience an additional phase evolution due to the ( fluctuating ) magnetic field .",
    "strategies to avoid these decoherence sources will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase - coherence ] .",
    "we note here that a good qubit must not necessarily combine a large coherence time to manipulation time ratio with high fidelity initialization and read - out capabilities : initialization and read - out can be implemented with an additional auxiliary ion of a different ion species .",
    "this idea has already been demonstrated by the nist group @xcite : in this experiment aimed at implementing a frequency standard , the state of an individual al@xmath0 ion was detected via a be@xmath0 ion .",
    "however , for practical purposes it is desirable to initialize and read out the qubit ion directly .",
    "finally , a good qubit candidate must have all the relevant transitions in an accessible frequency regime .",
    "generally , laser sources , fibers and detectors for short wavelengths are more expensive , less efficient and often more fault - prone than for longer wavelengths .",
    "however , ions tend to have short wavelength transitions .",
    "thus there are only a very limited number of ions which have strong transitions in the visible frequency range . in the quantum computing context , calcium , strontium and ytterbium ions appear to be attractive due to their relative large wavelength transitions .",
    "however , beryllium and magnesium have a relatively small atomic mass which leads to large lamb - dicke factors ( @xmath56 in some of the nist experiments ) and eases coupling of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom and thus makes them attractive in spite of difficulties with laser radiation generation , manipulation and fiber optics .",
    "prior to the implementation of a quantum algorithm , the qubits must be initialized in a well - defined state . for atoms , in general ,",
    "this can be most conveniently achieved by optical pumping .",
    "this idea was introduced by @xcite and first implemented by @xcite and by @xcite . for reviews on optical pumping",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the general idea of optical pumping is that an atom is driven until it decays into a state where the drive does not act any longer .",
    "usually circularly polarized light is used to pump the atom into one of the extreme zeeman - levels .",
    "typically , the target state is occupied in less than 1  @xmath57s with a probability larger than @xmath58 .",
    "the initialization fidelity is usually limited by the quality of the polarization of the driving laser along the preferred axis of the qubit . in most cases , this axis is given by the direction of the magnetic field .    for fault - tolerant quantum computing , however , it appears that initialization fidelities exceeding 0.9999 are desirable .",
    "it is not clear whether such high preparation fidelities can be achieved with the methods described above .",
    "furthermore , there exist situations where it is not possible to achieve a pure circular polarization along the quantization axis .",
    "the latter might happen for instance , because there is no optical access along the direction of the magnetic field to send a laser in . in these cases ,",
    "a frequency rather than a polarization selection can be used for optical pumping if the ions offer a spectrally narrow transition @xcite .",

    "a lens system collects typically @xmath75@xmath76 of this fluorescence light such that with a photomultiplier tube ( quantum efficiency @xmath77 30% ) about 30 photons / ms can be detected .",
    "as typical background count rates of photomultiplier tubes are usually well below 1 count / ms , one expects exceedingly high state detection fidelities when collecting fluorescence for detection times of more than one millisecond . however , this reasoning holds only if the ion has a negligible probability to decay either from the @xmath72 to the @xmath51 or from the @xmath51 to the @xmath53 or the @xmath73 level during the detection time . in practice , these two constraints lead to an optimal detection time where the error due to the poissonian spread of the number of scattered photons is balanced with the relaxation time scales @xcite .",
    "typical detection times are about one millisecond with detecion fidelities exceeding 0.99 . the fidelity can be further increased by anaysing the arrival times of the photons with a maximum likelihood method and thus identifying some events when the @xmath51 level decayed during the detection @xcite .",
    "other qubits can be detected very similarly . if the energy separation of the two qubits , however , is not large enough to allow for selection via the laser frequency , the polarisation of the laser field can be used .",
    "for instance for @xmath78be@xmath0 , circular polarization ensures that predominantly only one of the two qubit states scatters photons @xcite .",
    "the detection efficiency can be further increased when the quantum state is mapped onto auxiliary qubits prior to its measurement : for this , one prepares first an additional qubit ( the ancilla qubit ) in state @xmath79 .",

    "some of them rely as some of the already presented gates on state dependent ac - stark shifts , albeit in the static regime @xcite .",

    "2 .   the contributions of the increasing number of modes averages , such that the variance of the effective rabi frequency narrows . * * detuning errors * take place when the qubit transition frequency is miscalibrated or the drive frequency fluctuates slowly as compared to the duration of the coherent manipulation .",
    "furthermore , magnetic field fluctuations have the same effect and usually are also slow as compared to the coherent manipulation time .",
    "the effect of a detuning error is a constant phase evolution during the experiment .",
    "a simple and effective method to remove such a constant phase evolution is the so - called spin - echo method @xcite .",
    "the idea is that after half the evolution time the roles of the upper and the lower qubit level are exchanged .",

    "for instance , @xcite optimized the time position of the population inverting pulses both in simulations and in the actual experiment . * * addressing error * while addressing a single ion with a focussed laser beam , residual light might affect other ions in the trap and thus perform an undesired unitary evolution .",

    "[ eq : off - resonant - excitations ] ) .",
    "the innsbruck experiments suffered particularly from this effect @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically , the off - resonant excitation can be understood as rabi oscillations induced by a non - adiabatic switching of the energy eigenbasis while the laser power is changed .",
    "thus a system initially being in an energy eigenstate finds itself not any longer in an eigenstate of the hamiltonian and consequently oscillations between the newly populated energy eigenstates occur .",

    "the carrier transition nearby leads to an ac - stark shift of the qubit levels and thus the qubit phase evolves @xcite . in principle , this phase evolution can be measured and then taken into account in the algorithm to be implemented . in the innsbruck setup the problem , however , with this approach is that the acquired phase shift during a controlled - not operation is typically on the order of @xmath261 . in order to obtain a reasonable phase stability of 0.1  @xmath106",
    ", one needs an intensity reproducibility of better than 0.005 .",
    "to achieve this intensity stability of a particular polarization at the ion position with a narrow beam waist is quite demanding . to relieve this stringent condition ,",
    "a second light field can be used which induces an ac - stark shift of the same magnitude but of opposite sign @xcite .",
    "this field can be most conveniently derived by driving the acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) used to control the qubit - control field with a second rf signal .",
    "thus the two laser fields , for qubit manipulation and for ac - stark shift compensation , are generated simultaneously by the same aom .",
    "both light fields pass then along the same path to the ions such that they pick up virtually the same intensity , polarization and beam pointing fluctuations , removing the ac - stark shifts to a large extent .",
    "+ in the innsbruck experiments , also a considerable ac - stark shift appears due to dipole - allowed transitions @xcite . for the blue sideband",
    ", the presence of the dipole - allowed transitions cancels partially the shift induced by the presence of the carrier transitions , whereas for the red sideband they add .",
    "thus in the innsbruck experiments for coupling the ions to the motion , the blue sideband is preferred over the red one .",
    "another possibility to reduce ac - stark shifts is to use the polarization degree of freedom .",

    "most of these decoherence sources can be minimized by changing external parameters .",
    "for example the laser intensity can be reduced such that ac - stark shifts become negligible at the expense of slow gates .",
    "slow gates in turn increase the susceptibility to dephasing due to fluctuating magnetic fields and laser frequencies .",
    "similarly high trap frequencies allow for faster gates @xcite , but make good addressing of the individual qubits more difficult . in the experiments therefore often a compromise has to be made to keep all decoherence mechanisms reasonably small . finally , the previous paragraphs listed the most common important imperfections .",
    "however this list is of course incomplete : for instance , a finite residual temperature of the ion string leads to single and two - qubit gate errors .",
    "especially , the cirac - zoller gate is very susceptible to imperfect cooling .",
    "this error source is very special , since the combined fidelity of two concatenated gates is not the product of the individual gate fidelities as discussed in sec .",

    "however , current detection efficiencies of photons are not high enough to close the so - called detection loophole , i.e. one must assume that the detected particles represent a fair sample of all particles emitted by the source @xcite . therefore there is a large interest in testing bell - inequalities with trapped ions where the detection fidelities approach unity .",
    "such an experiment was conducted with @xmath78be@xmath0 ions by @xcite and closed the detection loophole .",
    "however , the ions were not detected outside their respective light cone , i.e. the detection time was longer than the time it takes light to travel between the ions .",
    "thus there could still exist a combined detection - locality loophole .",
    "this loophole could be excluded for instance by creating entanglement between ions or atoms separated by several kilometers .",
    "another interesting aspect of the ion trap experiments is that the entangled states are produced deterministically .",
    "that means that in contrast to the photon experiments , the entangled states are created on demand .",
    "more importantly , the entangled states are not destroyed during their creation such that they can be used for further experiments .",
    "current research is directed towards entangled states with more than two particles .",
    "already for three qubits , two classes of entanglement appear : ghz states @xcite and w states @xcite .",

    "the quality of the ghz state was high enough , that from the resulting generalized ramsey fringes ( c.f .",
    "eq .  [ eq : parity - oscillations ] ) the phase could be estimated @xmath328 times more accurately than using three uncorrelated particles . estimating the phase of superpositions is quite important in frequency measurements .",
    "the high fidelity of the ghz states was made possible by using the geometric phase gate ( sec .",

    "as for ghz states , a fidelity above 0.5 implies automatically the presence of genuine @xmath331-partite entanglement , the latter experiments demonstrated up to six partite ghz - like entanglement . while the nist group uses predominantly global addressing and state read - out , the innsbruck group entangled ions mainly with laser pulses addressed to individual ions .",
    "for instance , a bell can be created in the following way ( please note that the right - most ion is the first one ) @xcite : @xmath332 the success of the bell - state generation is usually verified using a procedure called state tomography ( see sec .  [",

    "however , in these experiments two ions of the same species were used . as",
    "typically one of the qubit levels takes part in the cooling process , it is important to shield other nearby ions from the radiation to maintain the coherence of the qubits during the cooling process .",
    "this is very difficult if only one ion species is employed .",
    "@xcite cool a @xmath497cd@xmath0 ion via doppler cooling of @xmath498cd@xmath0 . the isotope shift would help to preserve the coherence , however , it might be better to use a completely different ion species as done in the early experiments by the nist group .",
    "@xcite cooled be@xmath0 with mg@xmath0 to the motional ground state ( vice versa only to the doppler limit ) and in separate measurements showed that even on time scales of 30  ms a qubit encoded in the hyperfine manifold of @xmath78be@xmath0 is not affected by the strong cooling light for mg@xmath0 .",
    "finally , @xcite took the idea one step further and cooled and detected the internal state of al@xmath0 via be@xmath0 .",
    "while all prerequisites for quantum computing by shuttling ion strings have now been demonstrated in separate experiments , the combination of shuttling ions , splitting and re - cooling the ion strings in the same experiment and at the same time preserving the quantum information has yet to be accomplished .",
    "parallel to the efforts to shuttle and split ion strings , in particular the nist group has put quite some effort into developing new traps manufactured by microfabrication techniques to build a medium sized quantum computer .",
    "microfabrication techniques allow for complicated and precise electrode structures .",
    "trap sizes ( measured as the distance between two rf electrodes ) range from about 200  @xmath57 m down to a few tens of @xmath57 m . while in the beginning mainly three - dimensional designs were built using two substrates , recently a new , planar trap design was invented by @xcite .",
    "[ sec : planar - traps ] in such traps the electrodes are aranged all in a plane such that a single substrate suffices to mount the electrodes . typically there are five ( four ) electrode groups in such a linear surface trap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : planar - trap ] ) : on the center electrode , ground or a small dc potential is applied .",
    "the two neighboring electrodes receive an rf potential which provides the radial confinement .",

    "[ fig : planar - trap]b where the rf field vanishes .",
    "the asymmetry of the rf electrodes tilts the principle axes of the quadrupole field such that a laser beam traveling parallel to the trap surface has a projection along both radial motional degrees of freedom and all modes can be cooled satisfactory .",
    "two trap designs were successfully used by the nist group , one based on gold on a quartz substrate @xcite and the other one based solely on silicon @xcite .",
    "ions have been trapped as close as 40  @xmath57 m to the surface with still reasonable heating rates of a few phonons / ms @xcite .",
    "the mit group developed a trap based on printed circuit board fabrication techniques @xcite .",
    "they also built traps using silver on a quartz substrate @xcite .",
    "for trap sizes between 75  @xmath57 m and 150  @xmath57 m ( ion - substrate distance ) , heating rates between 2 and 20 phonons / s were measured at 4  kelvin ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : motional - coherence ] ) .",
    "in order to achieve universal quantum computing , the algorithms have to be implemented in a fault - tolerant way .",
    "it is commonly accepted that this requires quantum error correction .",
    "therefore , currently one of the most important goals is to implement quantum error correction repeatedly with high fidelity to prolong coherence times and to correct for errors induced by the gate operations . the largest obstacle to perform",
    "a successful quantum error correction protocol seems to be the limited fidelity of the operations .",
    "the current state of the art for the control in ion trap quantum computing can be summarized as follows :    * the qubit coherence times are one or two orders of magnitude longer than the basic ( gate ) operations . in specific cases coherence times",
    "longer by more than five orders of magnitude the gate time are available ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : clock - transition ] ) . in most current experiments ,",
    "motional decoherence is not a problem .",
    "in addition , it can be further suppressed with cooling of the trap electrodes ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : motional - coherence ] ) .",
    "* initialization accuracies are on the order of 0.999 as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : optical - pumping ] .",
    "most likely they can be improved further if necessary . *",
    "single qubit operation can be carried out with fidelities exceeding 0.995 @xcite",
    ". if required , further improvements are possible with more stable laser fields at the ion positions .",
    "* implementations of two - qubit gate operations achieve fidelities of about 0.90.99 .",
    "depending on the gate type , various sources limit the fidelity .",
    "errors are caused by off - resonant scattering , imperfect addressing of individual qubits , insufficient cooling , laser frequency and intensity noise . *",
    "the read - out of a single qubit can be performed with a fidelity of 0.999 .",
    "further improvements seem possible ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : state - detection ] ) .",
    "* ion strings can be shuttled , split and merged ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : moving - ions ] ) with high fidelity and small decoherence .    currently , two - qubit gate operations seem to be the main limiting factor and receive therefore most attention both from experimenters and theoreticians . figure  [ fig : two - qubit - fidelities ] shows the progress of the fidelity achieved in the last decade .",
    "most notably @xcite demonstrate two - qubit gate fidelities high enough to allow in principle fault tolerant quantum computation according to the scheme proposed by @xcite .",
    "progress in reducing the error rate of two - qubit gates ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) and in increasing the number of entangled ions .",
    "open circles represent experiments using two - qubit gate operations with global addressing while diamonds show results based on individual addressing .",
    "the performance is measured in terms of the infidelity of produced bell states .",
    "the stars mark the largest number of entangled ions obtained at that time .",
    "numbers below the reference indicate the number of trap cycles required for the operation . dashed and dotted lines indicate the trends .",
    ", scaledwidth=96.0% ]    in addition , one must always keep in mind that all these requirements have to be met at the same time .",
    "furthermore , some emphasis should be given to parallel processing quantum information @xcite .",
    "however , also initialization of the necessary ancillas , read - out , coherence times and the particular layout and the attainable degree of parallelization are important .",
    "both , analytical and numerical results , indicate that operational fidelities on the order of @xmath499/operation seem to be sufficient to achieve fault tolerance ( the so - called fault - tolerant threshold ) , provided certain other criteria can be met , too @xcite : specific errors , error propagation , the allowed overhead , specific requirements , the amount of possible parallelization , amongst others have to be considered to get a full grasp on the situation at hand .",
    "thus the concept of thresholds is oversimplifying the situation .",
    "for instance , @xcite published numerical results which indicate that even error rates on the order of @xmath76 are permitted , however with a huge overhead of @xmath500 physical qubits for one logical qubit .",
    "it seems reasonable that every operation in a quantum computer should be treated with the same meticulous attention and be implemented as perfect as possible to achieve fault tolerance while keeping the overhead as small as possible.[sec : threshold ]    interestingly , state transfer between interconnected ion trap quantum computers at the fault - tolerant level is not necessary as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : entanglement - purification ] @xcite : quantum information can be teleported deterministically between two locations using a purified entangled bell - state .",
    "entanglement between distant ions can , for example , be generated by splitting an entangled two - ion string and transporting one of the ions or by interfering fluorescence light from two ions on a beam splitter as demonstrated already by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another important issue is the speed of the operations .",
    "having in mind universal quantum computing to outperform classical computers , e.g. in factoring large integers , billions of operations have to be carried out .",
    "thus , the current typical time scales for the basic operations of a few hundreds of @xmath57s seem simply too slow for factoring large numbers even if the operations are carried out to a large extent in parallel .",
    "there exist proposals for gate operations which are faster than the trapping frequencies @xcite , however , there are other bottlenecks such as read - out and ion string separation which might slow down the processor speed .    from this perspective",
    ", it seems attractive to work on hybrid devices where e.g. quantum information is stored in trapped ions ( incl .",
    "error correction ) and most of the processing is implemented e.g. with josephson junctions @xcite which operate at speeds roughly three orders of magnitude faster than current ion trapping approaches . before this can happen , however , tremendous difficulties have to be solved in transferring quantum information between the two systems within the short coherence times of the josephson junction qubits .",
    "currently , there exist a few proposals to couple ion - trap and josephson junction qubits @xcite , but so far almost no experimental results were achievable .",
    "furthermore , within the field of josephson junction quantum information processing , there are some open challenges before advantage can be taken of the speed of this system .",
    "the biggest of these seems to be that coherence times of only a few @xmath57s have been achieved so far . the original proposal of cirac and zoller @xcite is scalable in the sense that it does not require exponentially many resources with an increasing number of qubits .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : two - qubit - fidelities ] shows that in the last decade larger and larger ion strings have been entangled .",
    "however , it seems impractical to construct a device for a large number of qubits by trapping all ions in the same trap because it gets more and more difficult to obtain the required strong radial confinements to work with linear ion strings at reasonably high axial trapping frequencies .",
    "furthermore , the mode structure of the ion crystal gets more complicated with more ions as well as the speed of the sideband operations is reduced with the larger mass of the crystal . up to date",
    "there are a couple of routes known which potentially ease these technological challenges .",
    "almost all of them are based on distributing the ions across different traps and to interconnect these traps via photons @xcite , superconducting strip lines @xcite or even via auxiliary ions @xcite .",
    "[ sec : scaling ] the currently most advanced procedure , however , is to merge and shuttle small ion strings in segmented traps @xcite . those ideas have been studied in detail and seem to offer a practicable and viable way to scale ion trap quantum computers",
    ". currently , big efforts are under way in realizing this architecture ( c.f .",
    "[ sec : moving - ions ] ) .",
    "major challenges are the fabrication of such complex small ion traps combining high flexibility of ion movement ( junctions ) , low motional heating rates and high trap frequencies .",
    "it is also strongly desirable to integrate the control electronics and optics on such ion trap devices .    in summary ,",
    "the basic requirements for a general purpose quantum computing device with trapped ions have been demonstrated and no fundamental road block is in sight .",
    "however , building such a device is extremely challenging .",
    "especially , the stringent requirements for fault tolerance and for scalability to many thousands of qubits pose huge difficulties .",
    "however , reaching a good control over a reasonable number of qubits seems feasible in the next decade and might be of quite some interest : already with about forty qubits , physical systems can be simulated which are intractable with current computing technology .",
    "it remains to be seen whether and how the dream of universal quantum computing can be implemented with trapped ions .",
