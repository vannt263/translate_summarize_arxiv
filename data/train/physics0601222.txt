    "in recent years statistical mechanics has enlarged its original assignment : the application of statistics to large systems whose states are governed by some hamiltonian functional  @xcite . its capability for relating microscopic states of individual constituents of a system to its macroscopic properties are nowadays used ubiquitously  @xcite .",
    "certainly , the most important of these connections still is the determination of thermodynamic properties through the correspondence between the entropy concept , originally introduced by rudolf julius emmanuel clausius in 1865  @xcite , and the number of allowed microscopic states , introduced by ludwig boltzmann around 1877 when he was studying the approach to equilibrium of an ideal gas  @xcite .",
    "this connection can be expressed as @xmath6where @xmath7 is a positive constant , and @xmath8 is the number of microstates compatible with the macroscopic state of an isolated system .",
    "this equation , known as _ boltzmann principle _",
    ", is one of the cornerstones of standard statistical mechanics .    when the system is not isolated , but instead in contact to some large reservoir , it is possible to extend eq .",
    "( [ boltz - prin ] ) , under some assumptions , and obtain the _ boltzmann - gibbs entropy _",
    "@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the probability of the microscopic configuration @xmath11  sbg .",
    "the boltzmann principle should be derivable from microscopic dynamics , since it refers to microscopic states , but the implementation of such calculation has not been yet achieved .",
    "so , boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics is still based on hypothesis such as the molecular chaos  @xcite and ergodicity  @xcite . in spite of the lack of an actual fundamental derivation , bg statistics",
    "has been undoubtedly successful in the treatment of systems in which _ short _ spatio / temporal interactions dominate . for such cases , ergodicity and ( quasi- ) independence",
    "are favoured and khinchin s approach to @xmath12 is valid  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is entirely feasible that other physical entropies , in addition to the bg one , can be defined in order to properly treat anomalous systems , for which the simplifying hypothesis of ergodicity and/or independence are not fulfilled .",
    "examples are : metastable states in long - range interacting hamiltonian dynamics , metaequilibrium states in small systems ( i.e. , systems whose number of particles is much smaller than avogrado s number ) , glassy systems , some types of dissipative dynamics , and other systems that in some way violate ergodicity .",
    "this includes systems with non - markovian memory ( i.e. , long - range memory ) , like it seems to be the case of financial ones . generically speaking , systems that may have a multi - fractal , scale - free or hierarchical structure in the occupancy of their phase space .",
    "inspired by this kind of systems it was proposed in @xmath13 the entropy  ct @xmath14 which generalises @xmath12 ( @xmath15 ) , as the basis of a possible generalisation of bg statistical mechanics@xcite . the value of the _ entropic index _",

    "qprops , latorabaranger99 .",
    "moreover , it has been recently shown  additive that it is also _ extensive _ , i.e. , @xmath19 for special kinds of _ correlated _ systems , more precisely when the phase - space is occupied in a scale - invariant form . by being extensive , for an appropriate value of @xmath2 , @xmath20 complies with clausius concept on macroscopic entropy , and with thermodynamics .    since its proposal",
    ", entropy  ( [ sq ] ) has been the source of several results in both fundamental and applied physics , as well as in other scientific areas such as biology , chemistry , economics , geophysics and medicine  @xcite .",
    "herein , we both review and present some new results concerning applications to the dynamics of financial market observables , namely the price fluctuations and traded volumes .",
    "specifically , we will introduce stochastic dynamical mechanisms which are able to reproduce some features of quantities such as the probability density functions ( pdfs ) and the kramer - moyal moments .",
    "moreover , we will present some results concerning the return multi - fractal structure , and its relation to sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "our dynamical proposals will be faced to empirical analysis of 1 minute returns and traded volumes of the 30 companies that were used to compose the dow jones industrial average ( dj30 ) between the @xmath21 july and the @xmath22 december @xmath23 . in order to eliminate specious behaviours",
    "we have removed the well - known intra - day pattern following a standard procedure  @xcite .",
    "after that , the return values were subtracted from its average value and expressed in standard deviation units , whereas the traded volumes are expressed in mean traded volume units .",
    "before dealing with specific financial problems , let us analyse the probability density function which emerges when the variational principle is applied to @xmath24 @xcite .",

    "the gaussian distribution , recovered in the limit @xmath54 of expression ( [ pq ] ) , can be derived from various standpoints . besides the variational principle",
    ", it has been derived , through dynamical arguments , by l. bachelier in his 1900 work on price changes in paris stock market  bachelier , and also by a. einstein in his 1905 article on brownian motion  @xcite . in particular , starting from a langevin dynamics , we are able to write the corresponding fokker - planck equation and , from it , to obtain as solution the gaussian distribution .",
