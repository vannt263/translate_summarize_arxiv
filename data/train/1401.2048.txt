    "among the central issues of hadron physics is chiral symmetry , its breaking in vacuum and its restoration in medium .",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken due to non - zero quark masses leaving the mass term of the lagrangian not invariant under chiral transformations .",
    "if only light quark flavors ( up , down ) are under consideration the assumption of massless quarks is justified . however , chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously , because the qcd ground state is not invariant under chiral transformations .    the chiral condensate @xmath1 is linked to order parameters of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this chirally odd condensate , i.e.  a condensate which is not invariant under chiral transformations , is non - zero and thus , signals spontaneous symmetry breaking , similarly to the vector and axial - vector mixing under axial transformations . besides the chiral condensates also further condensates are connected to order parameters of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , e.g.  chirally odd four - quark - condensates .",
    "chiral spontaneous symmetry breaking gets apparent due to the mass splitting of chiral partner mesons .",
    "for instance , in the light - quark sector , the axial vector meson @xmath2 is significantly heavier than its chiral partner , the vector meson @xmath3@xcite .    in a strongly interacting medium",
    "the situation changes drastically : we have to deal with non - zero temperatures @xmath4 and baryon densities @xmath5 . in leading - order , non",
    "- zero temperatures are modeled by a pion gas and finite densities by ambient nucleons .",
    "the chiral condensate changes in a medium according to ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pion decay constant , @xmath8 the pion mass and @xmath9 is the nucleon sigma term .",
    "obviously the numerical value of the chiral condensate decreases for increasing temperature and density ; chiral restoration would be accompanied by @xmath10 .",
    "the impact of further chirally odd condensates , e.g.  certain four - quark condensates behaving as the chiral condensate , is therefore of utmost interest in relation to chiral restoration .",
    "first investigations have been performed in the light - quark meson sector , e.g.  a significant impact of chirally odd four - quark condensates was found in the framework of rho meson sum rules @xcite .",
    "we aim at extending these evaluations to @xmath11 meson systems , containing an heavy ( @xmath12 ) and a light ( @xmath13 ) valence quark .",
    "choosing certain chiral transformations restricted to light quarks , one can derive an invariant lagrangian @xcite . however , vector and axial - vector currents as well as scalar and pseudo - scalar currents mix under these transformations , i.e.  also in the @xmath11 sector certain chirally odd condensates determine the mass splitting of chiral partner mesons . again , chiral symmetry restoration in medium is supposed to be accompanied by the vanishing of chirally odd condensates .",
    "theoretical investigations of four - quark condensates of @xmath11 meson systems in medium is of large interest , since the envisaged experiments of the cbm and panda collaborations at fair @xcite include the analysis of medium modifications of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "qcd sum rules proved to be a successful tool to extract spectral properties of hadrons in vacuum from the theory of strong interaction @xcite . during the",
    "last two decennia an extension to hadrons in an strongly interacting environment has given insight into their medium modifications @xcite , which are of large contemporary interest .",
    "the sum rule method utilizes the causal current - current correlator @xmath15 \\rangle \\ , ,      \\label{cccorr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] means time ordering and @xmath17 denotes a current reflecting the quark content and quantum numbers of the hadron under consideration .",
    "the correlator ( [ cccorr ] ) can be related to the hadrons spectral function via a dispersion relation which provides a link of qcd , formulated in quark degrees of freedom , and hadronic phenomenology .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath18 employs wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite .",
    "the ope is an expansion at operator level .",
    "the operator product is expanded in an asymptotic series of local operators @xmath19 with increasing mass dimension : @xmath20 the coefficients @xmath21 in this series expansion are the wilson coefficients .",
    "qcd provides three operators as basic elements for this expansion : quark operators @xmath13 , the gluonic field strength tensor @xmath22 and the covariant derivative @xmath23 , which appear in infinitely combinations building the @xmath19 .",
    "we consider the expectation value of the current - operator product , thus , we need to use the expectation values of the operators of the expansion .",
    "these expectations values are the condensates , characterizing the complex qcd ground state . in vacuum",
    "they have certain numerical values , which may be universally used for sum rule evaluation .",
    "qcd can not be treated perturbatively for low momentum transfers and long distance phenomena due to the running strong coupling @xmath24 .",
    "one of the beneficial features of the ope is the separation of scales @xcite , i.e.  long range effects are absorbed into the condensates and the wilson coefficients can be calculated by means of perturbation theory . in the light - quark sector , all vacuum condensates up to mass dimension 6 have been identified and their wilson coefficients have been determined , unlike the in - medium ope for @xmath0 mesons .",
    "their coefficients are determined up to mass dimension 5 for in - medium situations @xcite .",
    "the complete in - medium contributions of four - quark condensates are determined for light mesons only @xcite .",
    "the three - gluon condensate contribution , also of mass dimension 6 , has been calculated for vacuum situations so far @xcite .",
    "this work addresses crucial computational steps towards a comprehensive calculation of wilson coefficients of higher order condensates for in - medium situations , especially for four - quark condensates of @xmath11 mesons .",
    "new medium specific condensates come into play , which contain heavy quark operators .",
    "only expectation values of operators which carry the assumed symmetries of the qcd ground state are considered condensates @xcite .",
    "formally , condensates are expectation values of hermitian operator products , which are to be lorentz and dirac scalars as well as color singlets .",
    "they are invariant under parity and time reversal transformations .",
    "thus , the projection of dirac , color and lorentz indices of the expectation values has to be performed .",
    "the projection of dirac and color indices relies on orthogonal bases provided by the clifford algebra and the generators and unity element of the color group , respectively @xcite .",
    "projection of lorentz indices is more involved , in particular for in - medium situations .        in leading order ,",
    "four - quark condensates contribute to @xmath0 meson sum rules on tree - level in order @xmath24 .",
    "the four - quark condensate contributions in a diagrammatic representation ( cf .",
    "figure  [ diagrams ] ) are of two kinds : the meson momentum either flows through a quark or a gluon line @xcite .",
    "the depicted diagrams yield condensate contributions proportional to @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 symbolizes either @xmath12 or @xmath13 , @xmath29 stands for a generator or the unity element of the color group and @xmath30 , @xmath31 denote basis elements of the clifford algebra , carrying themselves up to two lorenz indices each .",
    "the projection of these uncontracted lorentz indices leads to 24 condensates in the @xmath11 sector , which are invariant under parity and time reversal transformations .",
    "in contrast to dirac and color projections , which rely on an expansion in an orthogonal basis , projecting lorentz indices is based on given elements which carry lorentz structures . in vacuum , these are the metric tensor @xmath32 and the totally anti - symmetric pseudo - tensor @xmath33 . for investigations of the temperature and/or density dependence of condensates ,",
    "a further lorentz structure is available for projection . due to the presence of the ambient medium",
    "the poincar invariance is broken , and the medium velocity @xmath34 needs to be considered additionally for projections .",
    "it has wide ranging implications , as it allows for the projection of expectation values with an odd number of lorentz indices which results in a multitude of new condensates .",
    "the ansatz for an expectation value @xmath35 carrying @xmath5 lorentz indices reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the vector of all projection structures and @xmath38 is the vector of the corresponding coefficients .",
    "contracting eq .",

    "defining a vector @xmath42 , which contains the expectation values contracted with all projection structures , we obtain @xmath43 thus , the projection formula for @xmath44 lorentz indices reads in compact form @xmath45 or more explicitly @xmath46^{-1 } \\langle o_{\\vec{\\kappa}_n } \\rangle \\mathbf{p}^{\\vec{\\kappa}_n } \\right\\ } \\cdot \\mathbf{p}_{\\vec{\\mu}_n } \\ , .",
