    "the pseudoscalar mesons , especially the @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are studied extensively to understand the under - structures from nonperturbative qcd ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the decay constants of the light mesons are one of the basic parameters in the particle physics and form an extremely important test ground for any nonperturbative qcd methods .",
    "particularly , the pseudoscalar - meson decay constants @xmath8 play an important role in hadron phenomenology ( e.g. , the leptonic decay width is proportional to @xmath9 and the @xmath10 element is extracted from the ratio @xmath11 ) and can be used as a test ground for models .",
    "a number of theoretical approaches obeying an accuracy comparable to the uncertainties in the experimental data , has relied on models containing too many , in some cases even nonphysical , parameters . on the other hand",
    ", the scaling property of qcd implies that all characteristics of hadrons must depend on a few global parameters .    among the significant theoretical approaches , the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) is a conventional approach in dealing with the two - body relativistic bound state problems @xcite and its solutions give useful information about the under - structure of the mesons .",
    "many analytical and numerical calculations indicate that the ladder bse with phenomenological models can give model independent results successful descriptions of the long distance properties of the low energy qcd and the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "below we adopt a relativistic quantum field model of interacting quarks and gluons under the analytic confinement , solve the bse in the one - gluon exchange approximation for the quark - antiquark bound states and estimate the decay constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the model relies on only necessary physical parameters @xmath12 which have been fixed to fit the meson masses in the ground states , orbital and radial excitations as well as the lowest - state glueball mass @xcite .",
    "in the conventional quark model mesons are @xmath13 bound states of quarks and antiquarks ( the flavors may be different ) .",
    "we deal with the pseudoscalars @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and vectors @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , the most established sectors of hadron spectroscopy .",
    "consider a yukawa - type interaction of quarks and gluons with the lagrangian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the quark field , @xmath20 is the gluon field , @xmath21 is the coupling strength , @xmath22 are the gell - mann matrices and @xmath23 are the color , spin and flavor indices .    the conventional qcd encounters a difficulty by defining the explicit quark and gluon propagator at the confinement scale @xcite . particularly , the infrared form of the gluon propagator is still a controversial aspect @xcite , there are various versions , with different behaviors for the infrared region : finite , zero and more divergent that @xmath24 , each one with its advantages and inconveniences @xcite",
    ".    nevertheless , the matrix elements of hadron processes at large distance are in fact integrated characteristics of the quark and gluon functions and taking into account the correct global symmetry properties and their breaking by introducing additional physical parameters may be more important than the working out in detail ( e.g. , @xcite ) . besides , the bound states of quarks and gluons may be found as the solution of the bse in a variational - integral form @xcite that is low sensible on tiny details of integrands .",
    "we consider the simplest effective quark and gluon propagators : @xmath25 \\right\\}_{\\alpha\\beta}\\over m^2 } \\exp\\left\\{-{p^2+m^2\\over 2\\lambda^2 } \\right\\}\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & & d_{ab}^{\\mu\\nu}(x)=\\delta_{ab}\\delta^{\\mu\\nu}~{\\lambda^2\\over ( 4\\pi)^2 } ~\\exp\\left\\{-{x^2\\lambda^2\\over 4}\\right\\ } = \\delta_{ab}\\delta^{\\mu\\nu}~d(x )   \\ , , \\label{propagat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 - the quark mass and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "these entire analytic functions in the euclidean metric keep the spirit of the _ analytic confinement _",
    "@xcite and imply that each isolated quark and gluon is confined in the background gluon field .    the meson mass is derived from @xcite : @xmath29 where the two - quark bound states are obtained by diagonalizing the quadratic part in the meson partition function on the full orthonormal system @xmath30 .",
    "this is nothing else but the solution of the appropriate bse ( in the one - gluon approximation ) : @xmath31 \\ , , \\label{bethe1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , the two - point function is introduced : @xmath32 \\label{twopoint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "we have solved eq.([bethe2 ] ) within a variational - integral approach and have found that the following values of free parameters : @xmath35 are optimal for the meson ground states , orbital and radial excitations @xcite .",
    "our estimates for the @xmath14 and @xmath16 meson masses in the ground state ( fig.1 ) were in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite and have a small experimental error ( @xmath36 per cent ) in a wide range @xmath37 .",
    "the lowest - state ( scalar ) glueball mass has been derived analytically @xcite : @xmath38    our estimate ( [ glueball ] ) is close to the result @xmath39 due to the quantized knot soliton model @xcite and quenched lattice estimate @xcite and in agreement with the predictions expecting non-@xmath40 scalar object in the range @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the estimated value @xmath42 coincides with the latest experimental data @xmath43 @xcite and the prediction of the quenched theory @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "note , this relatively weak coupling justifies the use of the one - gluon exchange mode in our consideration . by analysing the glueball mass formula ( [ glueball ] )",
    "one obtains the restriction @xmath45 that coincides with the two - loop value of the freezing coupling constant @xcite .",
    "a rough estimate of the hadronization distance @xmath46 shows that the confinement radius @xmath47 and @xmath48 are comparable values .",
    "below , we extend our consideration to the light meson decay constants .",
    "the decay constant @xmath8 is defined by the matrix element : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the axial vector current and @xmath51 is the normalized state vector .    there have been made many attempts to extract @xmath8 from meson spectroscopy .",
    "particularly , the decay constant @xmath52 for @xmath53-meson is determined from the combined rate for @xmath54 . with the recent experimental data one obtains @xcite :",
    "@xmath55 recent lattice qcd model with exact chiral symmetry estimates @xcite : @xmath56 the unquenched lattice qcd calculation predicts @xcite @xmath57          the solution of eq.([decay1 ] ) for different values of @xmath5 is plotted in fig.2 in comparison with the experimental data @xcite . in the region @xmath61 we underestimate @xmath62 and overestimate @xmath63 .",
    "evolutions of @xmath11 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 are depicted in fig.3 .        in conclusion , we have considered a relativistic quantum field model of interacting quarks and gluons under the analytic confinement and solve the bethe - salpeter equation in the one - gluon exchange approximation for the quark - antiquark @xmath13 bound states . despite the simplicity , this model resulted in a quite reasonable sight to the underlying physical principles of the hadronization mechanism and gave an accurate description of the ground states , orbital ( @xmath65 ) and radial ( @xmath66 ) excitations of mesons in a wide range of mass ( up to 9.5  gev ) and acceptable values of the light meson decay constants @xmath67 .",
    "our model provides a solid framework to compute the meson spectra , the lowest glueball state and decay constants of light mesons from the basic principles of qcd and qft .",
