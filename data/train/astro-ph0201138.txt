    "strong radio continuum emitters , such as radio galaxies or quasars , are identified with elliptical galaxies and recent mergers , and many of them have impressive radio jets with sizes larger than the host galaxy ( see wilson & colbert 1995 ) .",
    "maps of radio galaxies display fairly straight radio jets with distant lobes , showing the interaction of the jet with the ambient medium and indicating that the jet axis has been stable for thousands or even millions of years .",
    "recent work indicates the presence of lobes at a distance of hundred kiloparsecs from a spiral galaxy in a cluster ( @xcite ) . in normal spiral galaxies , on the other hand , most of the radio continuum emission comes from the disk component ( @xcite ) .",
    "radio surveys of seyfert galaxies indicate that the radio continuum emission arises mainly from three components : ( 1 ) subkiloparsec emission from the nuclear region ; ( 2 ) extranuclear kpc scale emission ; and ( 3 ) greater than kpc - scale emission associated with the disk ( @xcite ) . in barred spiral galaxies , the radio continuum emission is found from the following : ( 1 ) emission from the compact nucleus ; ( 2 ) emission from circumnuclear region ( @xmath5kpc ) ; ( 3 ) emission from dust lanes in leading side of the stellar bar ; and ( 4 ) emission from spirals arms and disk ( @xcite ) . depending on the central activity",
    ", a spiral can be classified as a starburst or an active galaxy .",
    "seyfert galaxies are stronger radio emitters at 1.4 ghz than normal and barred spirals ( @xcite ) .",
    "the central radio sources are sometimes associated with a pair of extended sources identified as lobes ( @xcite ) .",
    "these triple sources ( compact nucleus plus lobes ) are thought to be small scale , low power versions of the large scale jets and lobes seen in radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "the radio continuum emission from the central region of spirals is either linked to star formation , via hii regions and supernova remnants as in starbursts , or to an unresolved compact object , probably an agn ( baum et al 1993 ) .",
    "the study of ngc 3367 may be important in order to understand the lobe - central source relationship and help to clarify the starburst - agn dichotomy .",
    "the barred spiral , ngc 3367 , is a mildly active galaxy , between a weak liner and a hii nucleus ( @xcite ) that displays such a triple source structure . at 15@xmath6 angular resolution",
    ", in addition to extended emission from different locations in the disk , it shows an unresolved radio source in the center plus two sources in opposite directions from it ( @xcite ) .",
    "maps at 4@xmath7 resolution indicated more clearly the presence of the two lobes , ( @xcite ) .",
    "the central source was not resolved at this 4@xmath7 angular resolution , and it was unclear if it is a point - like source or an extended circumnuclear structure , and whether or not it is really connected with the lobes .",
    "in this paper we present new vla radio continuum observations of ngc  3367 at 1.4 ghz with a beam of @xmath8 , and at 8.4 ghz with a beam of @xmath9 . ",
    "2 presents the observed properties of ngc 3367 ,  3 presents the new radio continuum observations and results , and  4 gives the discussion and conclusions .",
    "ngc  3367 is an sbc(s ) barred spiral galaxy with a stellar bar structure of diameter @xmath10 ( 6.7 kpc ) oriented at a position angle ( pa ) @xmath11 .",
    "the disk of ngc 3367 is inclined with respect to the plane of the sky at an angle between @xmath12 ( grosbl 1985 ) and @xmath13 ( @xcite ) , and has an optically bright sw structure resembling a half - ring , or a large scale `` bow shock '' , at about 10 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "this structure is formed by a collection of h@xmath14 regions , that looks like a necklace and its origin has been ascribed to an off - center impact with an external intruder , most likely a small galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the general arrangement of the h@xmath14 knots is similar to the elongated rings found in numerical simulations of off - center galaxy collisions by gerber & lamb ( 1994 ) . the expanding density wave created by the collision can trigger the formation of the half - ring of hii regions and , given that the expected wave velocity in the disk is below 100 km / s , the collision probably ocurred a few times 10@xmath15 yr ago . in addition , aside from the radial gas inflows induced by the stellar bar ,",
    "a galactic collision is also able to drive gas towards the galactic center inducing circumnuclear star formation as well as nuclear activity .",
    "ngc 3367 also shows h@xmath14 emission from the central region with an unresolved source , most likely , a combination of emission from a compact source and circumnuclear structure at a radius of less than 500 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the disk of ngc 3367 has a normal content of atomic hydrogen , with m@xmath16 m@xmath17 ( @xcite ) , and it is considered an isolated field galaxy , behind the leo group of galaxies at a distance of 43.6 mpc , with its closest neighbor more than 900 kpc away to the ne ( @xcite ) .",
    "its optical spectrum shows moderately broad h@xmath14+[nii ] lines with fwhm@xmath18 km s@xmath19 , but h@xmath20 is stronger than [ oiii]@xmath21   and there is weak emission of he ii @xmath22 , suggesting the existence of wr stars and weak liner activity ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , its x  ray luminosity is stronger than that of any normal spiral galaxy , but weaker than seyfert or radio galaxies ( @xcite ) . nonetheless , from the optical line ratios , ngc 3367",
    "is also considered to have an hii nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "the first radio continuum observation of the region around ngc 3367 was at 178 mhz , with several arcmin angular resolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the radio emission was identified with ngc 3367 ( @xcite ) , the bulk of the emission most likely originated from a radio galaxy @xmath23 north of ngc 3367 , detected later with better angular resolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , observations from arecibo at 430 mhz and 835 mhz with integrated fluxes of 583 mjy and 365 mjy respectively with @xmath24 angular resolution most likely included the flux of the background radio galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "green bank single dish observations of ngc 3367 at 5 ghz with a resolution of @xmath25 were carried out by sramek ( 1975 ) and bennett et al .",
    "( 1986 ) with integrated fluxes of 35 mjy and 71 mjy respectively .",
    "israel & van der hulst ( 1983 ) reported an integrated flux of 18 mjy at 10.7 ghz with an angular resolution of @xmath26 from ovro 40 m .",
    "finally dunne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported a flux of 132 mjy at 350 ghz with @xmath27 angular resolution .",
    "the first aperture synthesis map of ngc 3367 at 1.49 ghz , with 15@xmath6 angular resolution , showed diffuse disk emission plus three peaks aligned in the ne ",
    "sw direction ( @xcite ) , and the disk emission was noticed to be edge brightened .",
    "a more recent mapping at this same frequency , but now with 4@xmath28 angular resolution , shows more clearly the emission from the triple source : emission from the nuclear region in addition to emission from two extended lobes at a distance of @xmath29 kpc from the center ( @xcite ) .",
    "the polarization analysis indicated that only the sw lobe is polarized , suggesting that it is out of the disk of the galaxy and closer to the observer than the ne lobe ( the emission of the ne lobe has been depolarized because this emission has passed through the plane of the galaxy)(@xcite ) .",
    "these observations showed very clearly the presence of kiloparsec scale lobes from a barred spiral galaxy seen almost face on , in addition to the weaker emission from a large number of compact sources in the disk .",
    "we have carried out radio continuum observations at the vla in new mexico in the a array at 1.3851 ghz , 1.4649 ghz , 8.4351 ghz and 8.4851 ghz in 1998 april 23 , using 27 antennas with 50 mhz bandwidths , and @xmath30 integration time at 1.4 ghz and @xmath31 at 8.4 ghz on ngc 3367 .",
    "we observed 3c286 as the amplitude and polarization calibrator and 1120 + 143 as the phase calibrator at 1.4 ghz and 1051 + 213 as the phase calibrator at 8.4 ghz .",
    "we adopted a flux density of 3c286 of s@xmath32 jy at @xmath33 ghz , and",
    "s@xmath34 jy at @xmath35 ghz .",
    "several iterations of phase self - calibration were used at 1.4 ghz .",
    "no self - calibration was used at 8.4 ghz because the peak emission was only @xmath36 mjy beam@xmath19 .",
    "[ hi ]      figure 1 shows the total intensity map at 1.4 ghz of ngc 3367 with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) angular resolution beam of @xmath37 at a p.a.@xmath38 and an rms noise of @xmath39jy beam@xmath19 .",
    "the emission above the 2@xmath40 level clearly shows the central source and lobes .",
    "the central source has a peak emission of 11.2 mjy beam@xmath19 and is still unresolved . at the 2@xmath40 level",
    ", there is no clear connection of the central source and the sw lobe .",
    "there are , however , extensions pointing toward the ne and sw lobes , and a faint connection appears at about 1@xmath40 ( see below ) . at this new higher angular resolution 1.4 ghz observation ,",
    "the emission from the lobes starts to be resolved , and the sw lobe shows the same polarization ( not shown here ) as in the previous @xmath41 angular resolution observations , namely that the eastern side of the lobe shows the strongest polarization ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ hi ]    the emission from both lobes is mostly diffuse , with some clumpy structure .",
    "the morphology of the sw lobe resembles a bow shock , probably due to the interaction of a relativistic jet with a low density ambient medium .",
    "there is faint emission directed from the central radio source towards the sw lobe , indicating that they are connected through a low surface brightness continuous structure , @xmath42 ( 2.5 kpc @xmath43 850 pc ) , perhaps jet - like .",
    "the width is probably an upper limit dictated by the restoring beam size .",
    "this is seen in figure 2 , which shows the faint emission from the innermost @xmath44 central region of ngc 3367 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the contours are drawn starting at a 1@xmath40 level , and shows that the central emission indeed connects to the sw lobe .",
    "although in figure 2 there is a minimum of emission midway ( ie .",
    "@xmath45 ) the 1@xmath40 contour surrounds this minimum and connects the central radio emission with the sw lobe ; in order to verify the existence of the structure , we did make several maps with different restoring beams with self calibration of phase and amplitude and the structure was there in all maps although with slightly different detailed morphology ( not shown here ) .",
    "therefore we feel confident that the structure connecting the central radio emission and the sw lobe really exists ; however , the detailed morphology needs to be taken with caution .",
    "the average p.a.@xmath46 of this structure is @xmath2 with a spread of @xmath47 .",
    "the ne extension of the central radio source is seen clearly at a p.a .",
    "@xmath48 , and seems to be the starting part of the counter jet that flows towards the ne lobe .",
    "the stellar bar , however , is oriented at p.a.@xmath49 . in the sw , the radio extension lies to the south of the optical bar , while in the ne , the radio extension lies to the north of the bar ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "there is no radio continuum emission ( at the three sigma level of the rms noise ) from any dust lane in the leading side of the stellar bar , as is often detected in other barred galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the sw lobe is out of the plane of the galaxy suggests that the relative alignment between the radio structure ( connecting the central radio source and the sw lobe ) and the stellar bar may be only a projection of the structure onto the galaxy disk and that the structure is out of the plane of the galaxy disk .",
    "[ hi ]      figure 4 shows the radio continuum contours of the emission from the innermost @xmath50 central region of the galaxy at 8.4 ghz , with an angular resolution of @xmath51 at a p.a.@xmath52 and an rms noise of 11@xmath53jy beam@xmath19 .",
    "the emission is dominated by a still unresolved central source of 0.96 mjy beam@xmath19 , at @xmath54 .",
    "its deconvolved diameter is less than 65 pc , and is surrounded by several low surface brightness peaks of emission out to a distance of @xmath55 pc .",
    "a rather similar structure is found in the lower resolution map at 1.4 ghz when a central unresolved source is subtracted . at 8.4 ghz",
    ", there is a short extension at a pa of 230@xmath4 , the same as seen for the jet on larger scales .",
    "no polarization is detected at 8.4 ghz , with an upper limit of 2 % for the compact nucleus , and a characteristic limit of 25 % for the circumnuclear structure .",
    "peak fluxes at various positions in the circumnuclear region are all smaller than 100@xmath53jy beam@xmath19 .",
    "[ hi ]    figure 5 shows the innermost @xmath56 central radio continuum with a superposition of the 1.4 ghz ( in contours ) and the 8.4 ghz ( in greyscale ) emissions .",
    "the emission is clearly dominated by the central source and an estimate of the spectral index between 1.4 ghz and 8.4 ghz ( integrated over the central @xmath57 ) gives @xmath58 ( s@xmath59 ) , indicating that the radiation is mainly synchrotron emission .",
    "the interpretation of spectral index should be taken with caution since the fluxes are the sum of the core plus the circumnuclear sources .",
    "the total flux at 1.4 ghz within @xmath60 is 16.8 mjy , while the total flux at 8.4 ghz within @xmath41 is 5.4 mjy .",
    "we have observed the radio continuum emission from the barred galaxy ngc  3367 , with the vla a array , at 1.4 ghz and 8.4 ghz with 2@xmath0 and @xmath1 spatial resolutions , respectively .",
    "the radio maps show emission from the central region , the lobes , and a weak jet .",
    "this morphology in ngc 3367 resembles the morphology of more powerful radio galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the power at 1.4 ghz is two to three orders of magnitude less than any radio galaxy and it is more like the power of seyfert galaxies , see table 1 ( see figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless this is one of the largest and best defined triple source ever detected in a galaxy considered to be a normal barred spiral .",
    "the triple source is due to emission from the central sources , emission from a jet - like structure connecting the central emission with the lobes and the extended lobes .",
    "other large radio structures have been observed in the seyfert galaxies , for example , mrk 6 ( lobe extent 14 kpc ) , mrk 348 ( lobe extent 5 kpc ) , ngc 3516 ( lobe extent 8.5 kpc ) ( @xcite ) , ngc 4235 ( lobe extent 9 kpc ) ( @xcite ) and in the disk galaxy o313 - 192 in the cluster a428 ( lobe extent 100 kpc ) ( @xcite ) . the radio continuum jets in other barred galaxies as ngc 1068 ( @xcite ) and ngc 5728 ( @xcite ) are much smaller in size ( of the order of tens to hundred parsecs ) .",
    "in contrast with o313 - 192 , which has an agn , and the markarian galaxies , which are seyfert 1s and 2s , ngc 3367 is only a mildly active liner and , based on optical line emission ratios and widths , is not even considered to be a seyfert galaxy .",
    "[ hi ]    the p.a@xmath61 of the jet - like structure ( @xmath62 ; see figure 3 ) is the same as the p.a@xmath63 of the major axis , as determined from h@xmath14 kinematics ( @xcite ) .",
    "the jet would be considered a low power one ( @xcite ) .",
    "the direction of the plasma outflow is thus not aligned with the rotation axis of the disk because , if that were the case , the relative orientation of the lobes , in ngc 3367 , would have to lie closer to the direction se - nw , that is , the projection of the p.a . of the minor axis as expected in the very simple picture that jets emanating from an active nucleus would emerge at right angles to the disk of the host galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "however the simple scenario is contradicted by the observations of seyfert galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observations of ngc 3367 suggest that the outflow axis is inclined with respect to the rotation axis of the galaxy and also inclined to the line of sight . a comparison between the the p.a . of the extended radio structures from seyferts with their host galaxies major - axis p.a .",
    "indicate that the radio structures in type-2 seyferts are oriented along any direction in the galaxy , and not necessarily along the minor axis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the directions of the radio jets are consistent with being completely uncorrelated with the planes of the host galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observations indicate that ngc 3367 ( being a noninteracting late - type liner / hii spiral having kpc lobes ) presents p.a@xmath64p.a@xmath65 .",
    "[ hi ]    the emission at 8.4 ghz , with the higher resolution , is complex and shows an unresolved nuclear source and several sources surrounding it .",
    "the circumnuclear radio sources are at all position angles ( see figs . 4 and 5 ) , and",
    "do not align at all with the lobes or with any other optical structure in the galaxy .",
    "this implies that the circumnuclear sources are probably located in the plane of the disk , and might be identified with a circumnuclear structure at distances of 125 pc to 325 pc .",
    "the radio emission from the inner @xmath41 is then most likely a mixture of synchrotron and free - free emission and the sources are most probably giant hii regions near an inner lindblad resonance ( as it is the case in other barred galaxies ) .    an additional hint for the existence of a circumnuclear structure is provided by the h@xmath14 emission .",
    "as mentioned earlier ngc 3367 shows h@xmath14 emission from the central region which is unresolved from ground observations ( @xcite ) with a bright emission from a compact source and weak extended emission from within @xmath66 . assuming that the peak of h@xmath14 coincides with the peak of the 8.4 ghz radio continuum emission , we then have subtracted the 8.4 ghz radio continuum emission from the h@xmath14 emission in such a way as to have zero emission from the center .",
    "the image , h@xmath14 - 8.4 ghz radio continuum , that is produced is shown in figure 6 ; it shows an h@xmath14 circumnuclear structure .",
    "this h@xmath14 image provides _ no _ proof of the existence of a circumnuclear structure since we have made several assumptions : ( 1 ) that the spatial position of peak of the h@xmath14 emission coincides with the position of the 8.4 ghz emission ; ( 2 ) that the radio continuum 8.4 ghz is related to the h@xmath14 emission in such a way that they are directly proportional to each other through a constant ; ( 3 ) that the constant of proportionality was chosen in such a way as to have zero emission from the very center ; ( 4 ) that the final subtracted image represents emission from the disk of the galaxy where we think the structure lies ( near a ilr ) .",
    "the image however is very suggestive of the existence of such a structure .",
    "if the circumnuclear structure represents regions of massive star formation one could estimate the rate of supernova using the relation ( @xcite ) :    @xmath67    using the integrated flux within the innermost @xmath68 at 1.4 ghz and assuming that all of this emission is of non - thermal origin ( which we know is wrong but hope that not by much ) and a spectral index @xmath69 then the expected supernova rate in the circumnuclear region of ngc 3367 is @xmath70 , which is very similar for other galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the global star formation rate using the far infrared ( _ iras _ ) luminosity and using the relation ( @xcite ) :    @xmath71    with a l@xmath72 ( @xcite ) we get sfr@xmath73 a value which similar to the values found in other galaxies ( @xcite ) .    as stated above , the gas in the circumnuclear structure could have been driven inwards either by the perturbations induced by the potential of the stellar bar , or by a possible off - center collision with a minor intruder . a reason in favor of the active compact radio nucleus is the short extension in the 8.4 ghz map that has a p.a . similar to that of the jet - like structure observed in the 1.4 ghz map that connects the central radio source with the sw lobe .",
    "if the flow were coming from a starburst wind ( originating from the circumnuclear structure ) , this wind would be directed ( in the most simple case ) out of the plane towards the rotation axis of the disk , ( where the density gradient is largest ) and the jet - like and lobes would be projected in the se - nw direction as mentioned above . therefore , although an elongated structure is not observed at 8.4 ghz forming a jet , the observations suggest that the plasma flows out from the compact nucleus , possibly directed in the observed orientation as a result of an accretion disk inclined ( but not perpendicular ) with respect to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "one thus could infer that the jet does not interact with the circumnuclear material .",
    "the interpretation of the origin of the energy for the jets , in ngc 3367 , might still controversial in the following respect , namely , the global q parameter .",
    "the q parameter is the ratio of the fir ( _ iras _ ) emission to the 1.4 ghz emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "empirically the median @xmath74 was found for spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) , while @xmath75 was found for galaxies powered by an agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , based on the value found for q for ngc 3367 ( q@xmath76 using the 5 ghz total emission ) it was concluded that the dominant energy source in ngc 3367 is stars ( @xcite ) . if we compute q using the total emission at 1.4 ghz ( 119 mjy [ @xcite ] ) , we get is q=1.9 which might indicate the presence of an ( mildly ) agn according to the convention ( @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that this result involves global emissions ( radio and infrared ) and not necessarily the energy powering the jets and lobes observed in ngc 3367 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result still needs to be confronted with the current observations of the central radio sources , jet and lobes in ngc 3367 .",
    "this central radio continuum structure ( compact source with circumnuclear regions ) is very similar to the structure observed in some barred sy 1 galaxies , like ngc 1097 ( @xcite ) and ngc 7469 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radius of the circumnuclear structure in ngc 1097 is about 550 pc ( @xcite ) , and about 450 pc in ngc 7469 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these are similar to the one observed in ngc 3367 ( @xmath77 pc ) .",
    "none of these seyfert galaxies , however , show any indication of a large scale jet or radio continuum extended lobes ( @xcite ) . in the case of normal barred galaxies , like ngc 1326 and ngc 4314 ,",
    "they show h@xmath14 circumnuclear structures with radio continuum emission characteristic from regions of star formation at similar radii ( 400 pc and 325 pc , respectively ) .",
    "none of them have radio continuum emission from the compact nucleus ( @xcite ) nor any radio continuum extended lobes .",
    "these differences in radio continuum emission morphology from barred galaxies probably suggest also differences in disk properties , like the amount of gas in the disk , the strength of the gravitational potential including the non - axisymmetric component , and possibly different ways of transporting material to the central regions and compact nucleus .",
    "our main results are as follows :    \\1 ) there is a faint structure that connects the central source with the sw lobe , here identified as a low surface brightness jet .",
    "thus , the lobes are currently being fed by plasma from the compact radio source .",
    "\\2 ) at the highest resolution , the 8.4 ghz emission shows an unresolved central peak with several circumnuclear sources . the unresolved source , which is located at the center of the galaxy , is @xmath78 10 times stronger than individual peaks of emission in the circumnuclear region , and its deconvolved diameter is smaller than 65 pc .",
    "\\3 ) the circumnuclear radio sources are most likely not associated with the interaction of the jet and the sourrounding medium .",
    "\\4 ) an estimate of the spectral index from the innermost region within @xmath68 is about -0.53 .",
    "\\5 ) the flow of plasma from the nuclear region to the lobes is out of the plane of the galaxy but inclined with respect to the rotation axis of the disk .",
    "\\6 ) no emission is detected from the stellar bar .",
    "our high resolution imaging has confirmed ideas from earlier work that ngc3367 is a currently active low power radio galaxy , continuing to be powered by a weak liner / hii nucleus . like other barred spirals ,",
    "it shows indications of star formation both in the center and on larger scales .",
