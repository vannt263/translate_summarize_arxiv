    "when a ferromagnetic metal ( @xmath0 ) with uniform magnetization is connected to a bcs superconductor ( @xmath1 ) , the singlet electronic correlations characteristic of the @xmath1 phase can propagate into @xmath0 because electrons and holes with opposite spins and excitation energies are coupled coherently by andreev reflections occurring at the @xmath2 interface .",

    "in all cases , the dos of the central conductor reveals the existence of the sdips - induced effective field only if it already presents a strong energy dependence near the fermi energy in the absence of a sdips . in the @xmath7 case ,",
