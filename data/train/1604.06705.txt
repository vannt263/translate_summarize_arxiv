    "transient black hole binaries are ideal objects to study accretion physics .",
    "they spend most of the times in the quiescence state and occasionally produce outbursts .",
    "their spectra have mainly two components : a multi - colored black body and a power - law component .",
    "the hot compton cloud @xcite close to the black hole reprocesses soft photons from the disk and produces a power - law tail .",
    "two component advective flow ( tcaf ) is a self - consistent solution of a viscous transonic flow in presence of radiative transfer .",
    "it was shown that @xcite flows above a critical viscosity parameter @xmath2 will become a keplerian disk @xcite , while those below will remain sub - keplerian .",
    "the sub - keperian halo creates a high density centrifugal barrier or even passes through a shock close to the black hole .",
    "this hot , puffed up region acts as the compton cloud .",
    "two accretion rates control spectral states of the black hole : if the accretion rate of the disk is large enough to cool down the centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ( cenbol ) which is the post - shock region , one obtains a soft state .",
    "the opposite is true for the hard state .",
    "the spectral properties of tcaf is studied in @xcite and @xcite . in certain situations",
    "this centrifugal pressure dominated boundary layer or cenbol exhibits radial and vertical oscillations and thus the comptonized photon number also oscillates and qpos are produced .",
    "this region is also responsible to produce outflows .",
    "a recent review on tcaf could be viewed in @xcite .",
    "a large number of works attempted to explain evolution of spectral states @xcite during outbursts of transient bhcs having temporal and spectral states with phenomenological models , such as disk black - body ( dbb ) , power - law ( pl ) , etc .",
    "however , using tcaf , state transitions and the origin of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) have been successfully modelled by our group @xcite . in tcaf , oscillations of the post - shock region",
    "is either due to the fact that the resonance condition @xcite is satisfied , or the rankine - hugoniot condition is not satisfied @xcite . for transient sources , qpos evolved monotonically @xcite due to the presence of compton cooling @xcite and variation of viscosity @xcite .",
    "it rises during the rising phase and decreases in the declining phase .",
    "after the inclusion of tcaf ( @xcite ) as a local additive table model in heasarc s spectral analysis software package xspec , physical understanding behind the variation of spectral states in an outburst became easier .",
    "tcaf model _ fits _ is found to be an effective tool to predict dominating ( type ` c ' ) qpos directly from the spectral fitted shock parameters .",
    "mass measurement ( @xcite ) becomes possible from the consideration of constant normalization factor during the fitting of observed data using tcaf .",
    "these encouraging aspects motivated us to fit the data with tcaf , even when they may also be fitted with other phenomenological models ( e.g. , dbb plus pl ) .",
    "gx 339 - 4 was first observed in 1973 @xcite by @xmath3 kev mit x - ray detector onboard oso-7 satellite .",
    "this stellar - mass black - hole binary has a mass function of @xmath4 = @xmath5 and low - mass companion of mass @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we adopt this value throughout the paper .",
    "this binary system is located at a distance of @xmath7  kpc @xcite with r.a.=@xmath8 and dec.=@xmath9 .",
    "as the gx  339 - 4 is a non - eclipsing binary , the inclination angle should be less than @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "estimation by @xcite gives a lower limit @xmath11 from the secondary mass function .",
    "joint modeling of suzaku and xmm - newton observation was used by @xcite to explain relativistic broadening of fe  @xmath12 line and obtain the spin parameter to be @xmath13 . using rxte and xmm - newton data",
    ", @xcite observed a distorted fe  @xmath12 line above the continuum .",
    "recently , @xcite calculated the value of spin parameter @xmath14 with @xmath15 inclination angle with reflection and disk continuum modeling .",
    "thus the exact values of the disk inclination angle and spin parameter are still doubtful .",
    "this required observations through more sensitive and high resolution instruments .",
    "there are extensive discussions on temporal , spectral and multi - wavelength properties of the source during its different outbursts @xcite using rxte / pca observation .",
    "some temporal and spectral properties of this candidate during its 2013 outburst have been discussed by @xcite and @xcite using nustar and swift @xcite observations with truncated disk model .",
    "the authors reported the presence of an iron line .",
    "there are many recent analysis on this object in the literature regarding spectral and timing properties @xcite . in this _ paper",
    "_ , for the first time , tcaf model fitting procedure was applied for the combined nustar @xcite and swift observations . since tcaf represents solutions of governing equations which include radiation mechanism , we expect that fits would yield actual physical parameters such as the accretion rates of two components and the size and other properties of the compton cloud on the days of the observation",
    ". specifically we want to check whether tcaf also requires an iron line and if so , whether it would be broad double peaked iron line as observed in suzaku and xmm - newton observations @xcite .",
    "earlier , @xcite described very accurately the splitting of red / blue shifted lines from their jet kinematic model ( so - called ballistic motion ) in ss433 .",
    "line profile for schwarzschild candidates was studied by @xcite .",
    "the _ paper _ is organized in the following way : in the next section , we briefly discuss observation and data analysis procedures using heasoft and nustardas software . in  3 , we present fitted results obtained from tcaf solution of swift and nustar data .",
    "we also discuss the flow geometry and the nature of the spectral state . from the fitted result",
    ", we get some signature of iron line with accretion rate , which also has been discussed .",
    "finally , in  4 , we present a brief discussion of our results and make concluding remarks .",
    "in the present manuscript , we analyze both swift / xrt and nustar satellite observations of gx  339 - 4 bhc during its 2013 outburst to obtain tcaf parameters and to check signatures of double peaked iron line .      in our present analysis",

    "nustar consists of two independent grazing incidence telescopes which focus x - rays onto corresponding focal planes consisting of cadmium zinc telluride ( czt ) pixel detectors .",
    "nustar is sensitive to x - ray energies from 4 - 79 kev and provides high spectral resolution at energies above 10  kev .",
    "the two focal planes are referred to as focal plane module ( fpm ) a and b. nustar data were extracted using the standard nustardas v1.3.1 software .",

    "this basically carries the information about the density and optical depth inside the compton cloud . in fig .",
    "1d , we show the variation of energy spectral index , which clears the hard state of the system throughout . at the beginning of the outburst ( mjd=56515.99 ) ,",
    "the shock was far away from the source and the shock strength was also high ( @xmath36 ) . in the final observation ( id = x10 ) disk accretion rates were down after @xmath37 days of x08 , indicating the end of the outburst . this value is higher than that on x04 day , although relative ratio ( halo rate / disk rate ) of the accretion rates is higher in the final observed day .    ) with day and ( c ) shock strength , during the 2013 outburst of gx  339 - 4 , using swift and nustar data . in bottom panel ( d ) variation of energy spectral index ( @xmath38 ) with day . ]    in the first ( x02 ) observed day , the disk rates are less compared to those on other days as the source was in the initial rising phase of the outburst .",
    "on x02 , when the outburst started , matter was moving with viscous timescale and started to form a keplerian disk by gradually increasing its rates .",
    "the flow was always fully dominated by the sub - keplerian rate as fresh matters were coming with low angular momentum and since the compton cloud could not be cooled down , states were always hard . at some point in time , viscosity started going down , and keplerian disk rate also started declining . as matter supply is reduced , the disk rate became lower also .",
    "the whole system was dominated by sub - keplerian flows throughout .    when it comes to the evolution of the size of the compton cloud , it is to be remembered that the outer boundary of the compton cloud is the shock itself .",
    "we find that the shock started to move towards the black hole from a location @xmath39 to @xmath40 ( where , schwarzschild radius @xmath41 ) within @xmath42  days on @xmath43 observation ( x08 on mjd=56538.41 ) . on the last observation ( x10 on mjd=56581.99 ) ,",
    "the shock again moved away and observed at @xmath44 ( see , fig .",
    "the shock compression ratio @xmath29 ( = @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are post- and pre - shock densities respectively ) was always observed to be higher than unity and became weaker on x06 and x08 observation days . on those days",
    "shock was also closer to the black hole .",
    "interestingly , in the whole outburst the shock is within 100 @xmath27 , in agreement with the results of earlier authors .",
    "after that for @xmath37 days there were no observation .",
    "it is possible that the source covered other spectral states , such as hard - intermediate , soft - intermediate and soft states but we may have missed them . on the x08 observation day",
    ", the shock was found to be receding and becoming strong again .",
    "high values of both @xmath29 and @xmath24 indicate that the source was in the hard state during the entire observations . due to the absence of soft state",
    ", we call this as a  failed outburst \" .",
    "these results are in agreement with @xcite .      for the first time we fit the swift and nustar observation with tcaf model .",

    "2a , unfolded spectra of all the observations after fitting with tcaf and laor model @xcite of double peaked iron line . from the tcaf model",
    "fitted parameters we see that the halo accretion rate is always greater than the disk accretion rate .",
    "thus we infer that the source was in the hard state during this particular outburst . in fig .",
    "2b , we show the residuals of these fits . due to the characteristic shape of the double peaked iron line and its very interesting variation with time",
    ", we show this separately in fig .",

    "the inclination angle was chosen to be @xmath48 ( col .",
    "12 ) throughout . the emitting region sizes ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 )",
    "are also given in the table .",
    "note that , the inclination angle chosen by us is within the range predicted by other workers discussed in the introduction .",
    "the inner edge of the emitting region gives us the lower limit of the marginally bound orbit .",
    "the lowest of @xmath51 corresponds to the marginally bound orbit of a kerr black hole of @xmath52 @xcite",

    "we have analyzed swift / xrt and nustar spectra of a very well - known galactic stellar mass black hole source gx  339 - 4 during its 2013 outburst using tcaf solution along with laor model .",
    "we find that as the day progresses , both the accretion rates ( @xmath21 and @xmath24 ) increase , the shock moves in ( i.e. , the compton cloud slowly collapses due to rapid cooling ) and its strength decreases .",
    "we observe that the source was in the hard state as the halo rate is always greater than the disk rate and the energy spectral index ( @xmath38 in col.7 ) is @xmath531 for all the observed days .",
    "according to @xcite and @xcite , an outburst is triggered due to a sudden rise in viscosity at the outer edge of the disk and is turned off when this viscosity is reduced .",
    "if viscosity does not rise above a critical value , the high angular momentum and highly viscous cooler keplerian disk component does not form @xcite and as a result , we may miss the softer states , such as the soft and soft - intermediate spectral states . on the other hand , the most plausible ` gap ' where these states could have been seen is that between x06 and x08 , which appears to be impossible for this object @xcite .",
    "so , it is likely that the viscosity did not rise above the critical value to have a strong keplerian component .",
    "furthermore , we find that the residual requires a double peaked iron line produced by a large rotational velocity in all the days , characteristics of the inner region of the flow .",
    "the double peak is clearly due to rotation , as the highest intensity of the lines are observed during the highest accretion rate days with relatively smaller size of the compton cloud .",
    "we also observed a significant change in line intensity during the days when the accretion rate is increased and the shock was closer to the black hole ( col .",
    "10 of table  1 ) . in col",
    ". 9 , laor model fitted power - law emissivity index @xmath54 is shown .",
    "this index indicates different regions of the disk follow different emissivity laws .",
    "the present tcaf @xmath55 file does not include the iron line and the general relativistic effects .",
    "thus we invoked ` laor model ' as a phenomenological model to understand the line emission profile and its time variation . according to @xcite",
    ", double - peaked profile is generally produced from the outer part of the disk and the red shifted component dies out at regions very close to the black hole .",
    "based on the present fitted parameters , though not very self - consistently obtained from tcaf solution alone , we find the upper limit of kerr parameter @xmath56 of gx 339 - 4 to be @xmath1 and the disk inclination angle is in between @xmath48 . in future , we will include these effects and hope to fit the data with tcaf only .",

    "<S> we fit spectra of galactic transient source gx  339 - 4 during its 2013 outburst using two component advective flow ( tcaf ) solution . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , we are fitting combined nustar and swift observation with tcaf . </S>",
    "<S> we use tcaf to fit 0.8 - 9.0  kev swift and 4 - 79 kev nustar spectra along with the laor model . to fit the data we use disk accretion rate , halo accretion rate , size of the compton cloud and the density jump of advective flows at this cloud boundary as model parameters . from tcaf fitted flow parameters , and energy spectral index </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the source was in the hard state throughout this particular outburst . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis also gives some idea about the broadening of fe @xmath0 with the accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> since tcaf does not include fe line yet , we make use of the ` laor model ' as a phenomenological model and find an estimate of the kerr parameter to be @xmath1 for this candidate . </S>"
