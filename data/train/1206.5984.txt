    "an example of such an energy is often referred to as the ohta - kawasaki energy , first introduced in @xcite , and takes the following form @xmath2 : = \\int_{u } |\\nabla u|+ \\gamma \\int_{u}\\int_{u } ( u(x)-\\bar u)g(x , y ) ( u(y)-\\bar u ) dxdy,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4    here @xmath5 denotes the space of functions of bounded variation taking values @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath8 ( see @xcite for an introduction to the space @xmath9 ) . the kernel @xmath10 is generally taken to be the kernel of the laplacian operator , with periodic boundary conditions when @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 describes the strength of the non - local term .",
    "it is clear that the non - local term favors the separation of mass while the perimeter favors clustering .",
    "the above problem describes a number of polymer systems @xcite as well as many other physical systems @xcite due to the fundamental nature of the coulombic term . despite the abundance of physical systems for which is applicable , rigorous mathematical analysis is fairly recent @xcite .",
    "one considers minimizing over the class @xmath13 the variational problem when @xmath14 has been studied in the limit @xmath15 when the phase @xmath16 dominates the @xmath17 @xcite . the minimizers in this case form droplets of the minority phase @xmath17 in the majority phase @xmath16 and each connected component of @xmath17 wishes to minimize the energy @xmath18= \\int_{\\mathbb{r}^d }",

    "we will often abuse terminology and say @xmath35 when we mean @xmath36 and write @xmath37 when we mean @xmath38 .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we will study exclusively with @xmath14 and @xmath39 , except for comments regarding results in @xmath1 for @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath39 , in order for minimizers to exist in @xmath41 to , it is necessary to modify the logarithmic kernel .",
    "the above energy with @xmath10 replaced by the kernel @xmath42 was recently studied by knupfer and muratov @xcite .",
    "a simple rescaling shows that for small masses , the effect of the non - local term is small compared to that of the perimeter .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that for small masses , the unique minimizer to is the ball .",
    "this was shown by knupfer and muratov @xcite in dimensions @xmath43 .",
    "moreover they show that for sufficiently large masses , for @xmath43 , minimizers of fail to exist , as it is favorable for mass to split .",
    "+    there is also much interest in critical points to which are not necessarily locally minimizing . here a critical point to is a set @xmath35 for which the first variation with respect to volume preserving diffeomorphisms vanish .",
    "[ defcp ] a set @xmath35 is a _",
    "critical point _ of if for all volume preserving diffeomorphisms @xmath44 it holds that @xmath45    in particular a simple calculation @xcite shows that @xmath24 is a smooth critical point if and only if it solves the following euler - lagrange equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the potential generated by @xmath24 , ie .",
    "@xmath49 is the curvature of @xmath50 and @xmath34 is the lagrange multiplier arising from the volume constraint .",
    "we however do not wish to assume a - priori regularity of the boundary as critical points may in general not be smooth .",
    "an important example demonstrating this is the coordinate axes in @xmath0 minus the origin . in this case",
    "the generalized mean curvature is constant on the reduced boundary @xmath51 , @xmath52 and hence is satisfied everywhere on @xmath53 ( see @xcite for a reference on generalized mean curvature and the theory of varifolds ) .",
    "the example of a figure 8 with center at @xmath54 also shows that while the curvature of a closed curve can be smooth and uniformly bounded on @xmath55 , there is not necessarily a natural way to make sense of the curvature or variations of near @xmath54 . in @xmath0",
    "however we can continue to make sense of the curvature at @xmath54 if there exists a parametrization of the boundary by a closed , rectifiable ( ie . has finite length ) curve . by the results of @xcite , any connected set with finite perimeter",
    "has a boundary @xmath50 which can be decomposed into a countable union of jordan curves @xmath56 with disjoint interiors . in this case",
    "however , as the figure 8 example demonstrates , one can not make sense of variations near points on the curve which are locally homeomorphic to @xmath57 $ ] , and can thus only expect to extract information from the euler - lagrange information on the reduced boundary .",
    "however , when the boundary @xmath50 can be decomposed into a countable _ disjoint _ union of closed , rectifiable curves , there is a natural way to consider variations of the domain , even on the compliment of the reduced boundary , by considering variations of the curve in the normal direction induced by the parametrization .",
    "we thus make the following definition .",
    "( admissible curves ) [ addef ] a connected set @xmath24 with finite perimeter will be called _",
    "admissible _ if its boundary @xmath50 can be decomposed into a countable number of closed , disjoint curves @xmath58 each admitting a @xmath59 parametrization @xmath60 \\to \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] with @xmath61 for @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "in particular we may write @xmath63 .",

    "indeed any manifold has a boundary which is not locally homeomorphic to @xmath57 $ ] and thus does not intersect any other segments of the boundary .",
    "in particular , each @xmath58 is therefore simple and disjoint from every other @xmath64 for @xmath65 , and never intersects itself transversally .",
    "working within the class of admissible curves , we are able to rigorously compute the euler - lagrange equation and extract sufficient information from it to conclude that admissible critical points are convex when @xmath39 and simply connected critical points are convex or star shaped when @xmath14 , in the small mass / energy regime .",
    "the details will be presented in section [ weakeleqn ] .",
    "when @xmath39 , the classification of critical points corresponding to either the perimeter term or non - local term , considered separately , has been well studied @xcite . in particular",
    "it is a well known result of alexandrov @xcite that in dimensions @xmath66 the only simply connected , compact , constant mean curvature surface is the ball . for the non - local term ,",
    "fraenkel showed somewhat recently @xcite that if @xmath67 constant on @xmath50 then @xmath24 must be the ball .",
    "this was recently extended to general riesz kernels by reichel @xcite , however restricted to the class of convex sets .",

    "can easily construct annuli which satisfy for particular choices of radii ( see counter example [ ce1 ] ) . even in @xmath68 examples of tori and double tori solutions to exist @xcite , showing that compact , connected solutions to exist other than the ball . since a smooth set is a critical point in the sense of definition [ defcp ] if and only if it satisfies [ eleqn ] ( see @xcite ) , this equivalently shows a lack of uniqueness for critical points of .",
    "we provide a partial answer to this question ( see theorem [ main3 ] below ) for a range of values of @xmath69 sufficiently small , by showing that the only connected critical point is the ball in the class of admissible sets in that range . more precisely , when the parameters or are sufficiently small .",

    "the way that we characterize critical points in both cases is by showing that any set @xmath24 as described above which is not a constant curvature surface satisfies @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the evolution of @xmath24 under area - preserving curve shortening flow , which is admissible under definition [ defcp ] .",
    "details will follow in sections [ vpmcfsec ] and [ mainresults ] .",
    "+ when @xmath39 our main results ( theorems [ main3 ] and [ nonexisti ] below ) will hold for @xmath83 with minor modifications to the proofs .",
    "it will always be made clear below which kernel is being used .",
    "when a constant depends on @xmath84 , this will mean exclusively for the kernel @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "in all such cases the dependence of the constant on @xmath84 may be dropped for the logarithmic kernel .",
    "+ we begin by defining the following parameters @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",

    "thus @xmath94 and @xmath95 represent the rate of change of the non - local term in the energy with respect to the length of the boundary .",
    "our result can thus be stated formally as saying that when the the change of the non - local term is small compared to a change in length , the critical points can be classified entirely in terms of those of the length term in , and thus are constant curvature curves .    for minimizers we have a natural a priori bound on @xmath96 coming from the positivity of both terms in the energy , which we do nt have for non - minimizing critical points .",
    "this explains the need for introducing .",

    "<S> using area - preserving curve shortening flow , and a new inequality relating the potential generated by a set to its curvature , we study a non - local isoperimetric problem which arises in the study of di - block copolymer melts , also referred to as the ohta - kawasaki energy . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to show that the only connected critical point is the ball under mild assumptions on the boundary , in the small energy / mass regime . in particular this class </S>",
    "<S> includes all rectifiable , connected 1-manifolds in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also classify the simply connected critical points on the torus in this regime , showing the only possibilities are the stripe pattern and the ball . in @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen as a partial union of the well known result of fraenkel @xcite for uniqueness of critical points to the newtonian potential energy , and alexandrov for the perimeter functional @xcite , however restricted to the plane . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of the result in @xmath0 is analogous to the curve shortening result due to gage @xcite , but involving a non - local perimeter functional , as we show the energy of convex sets strictly decreases along the flow . using the same techniques we obtain a stability result for minimizers in @xmath0 and for the stripe pattern on the torus , the latter of which was recently shown to be the global minimizer to the energy when the non - locality is sufficiently small @xcite . </S>"
