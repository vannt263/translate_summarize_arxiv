    "particle packing problems , such as how to fill a volume with given solid objects as densely as possible , are among the most ancient and persistent problems in science and mathematics .",
    "a _ packing _ is a large collection of non - overlapping solid objects ( particles ) in @xmath10-dimensional euclidean space @xmath11 . the packing density @xmath12 is defined as the fraction of space @xmath11 covered by the particles .",
    "dense ordered and random packings of nonoverlapping ( hard ) particles have been employed to understand the equilibrium and non - equilibrium structure of a variety many - particle systems , including crystals , glasses , heterogeneous materials and granular media @xcite . packing problems in dimensions higher than three attract current interest for retrieving stored data transmitted through a noisy channel @xcite .",
    "the packings of congruent hard spheres in @xmath13 have been intensively studied since despite the simplicity they exhibit rich packing characteristics .",
    "it is only recently that the densest packings with @xmath14 , realized by the face - centered cubic lattice and its stacking variants , have been proved @xcite .",
    "in addition , three - dimensional random packings can be prepared both experimentally and numerically with a relatively robust density @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the term _ random close packing _ ( rcp ) @xcite , widely used to designate the  random \" packing with the highest achievable density , is ill - defined since random packings can be obtained as the system becomes more ordered and a definition of randomness has been lacking .",
    "a more recent concept that has been suggested to replace rcp is that of the maximally random jammed ( mrj ) state @xcite , corresponding to the most disordered among all jammed ( mechanically stable ) packings .",
    "a jammed packing is one in which the particle positions and orientations are fixed by the impenetrability constraints and boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it has been established that the mrj state for spheres in @xmath13 has a density of @xmath16 , as obtained by a variety of different order metrics @xcite .",
    "this density value is consistent with what has traditionally asscoiated with rcp in three dimensions .",
    "it has been argued in the granular materials literature that large disordered jammed ( mrj ) packings of hard frictionless spheres are _ isostatic _",
    "@xcite , meaning that the total number of interparticle contacts ( constraints ) equals the total number of degrees of freedom of system and that all of the constraints are ( linearly ) independent .",
    "this implies that the average number of contacts per particle @xmath17 is equal to twice the number of degrees of freedom per particle @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) , in the limit as the number of particles gets large .",
    "this prediction has been verified computationally with very high accuracy @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a packing is _ hypostatic _ if it is mechanically stable ( i.e. , jammed ) while the number of constraints is smaller than the number of degrees of freedom . for large packings ,",
    "this is equivalent to the inequality @xmath20 .",
    "it has been shown that a jammed sphere packing can be not hypostatic @xcite .",
    "it is also of great practical and fundamental interest to understand the organizing principles of dense packings of nonspherical particles @xcite .",
    "the effect of asphericity is an important feature to include on the way to characterizing more completely real dense granular media as well as low - temperature states of matter .",
    "another important application relates to supramolecular chemistry @xcite of organic compounds whose molecular constituents can possess many different types of group symmetries @xcite .",
    "such systems can be approximated by nonspherical hard particles with the same group symmetries .",
    "recently , mrj packings of three - dimensional ellipsoids @xcite have been studied . in particular",
    ", it was found that the density @xmath12 and the average coordination number @xmath17 ( the average number of touching neighbors per particle ) increase rapidly , in a cusp - like manner , as asphericity is introduced from the sphere point .",
    "the density @xmath12 reaches a maximum at a critical aspect ratio @xmath21 @xcite and then begins to decrease ; while @xmath17 is increasing monotonically until it attains the plateau value for all @xmath22 beyond @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , @xmath17 is always smaller than twice the number of degrees of freedom per particle @xmath18 with its plateau value slightly below @xmath23 ( for an ellipse @xmath24 and for an ellipsoid @xmath25 ) . in other words ,",
    "the packings are _ hypostatic _ @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of mrj ellipsoid packings are distinctly different from their densest crystalline counterpart @xcite , in which @xmath12 increases smoothly as one moves away from the sphere point , and reaches a plateau value of @xmath26 for @xmath27 ( oblate spheroids ) and @xmath28 ( prolate spheroids ) .    in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we studied dense and maximally dense packings of _ superballs _ , a family of nonspherical particles with versatile shapes .",
    "in particular , a @xmath10-dimensional superball is a centrally symmetric body in @xmath11 occupying the region    @xmath29    where @xmath30 @xmath31 are cartesian coordinates and @xmath32 is the _ deformation parameter _ , which indicates to what extent the particle shape has deformed from that of a @xmath10-dimensional sphere ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "henceforth , the terms _ superdisk _ and _ superball _ will be our designations for the two - dimensional ( @xmath1 ) and three - dimensional ( @xmath7 ) cases , respectively .",
    "a superdisk possesses square symmetry , as @xmath3 moves away from unity , two families of superdisks can be obtained , with the symmetry axes rotated 45 degrees with respect to each other ; when @xmath33 , the superdisk is concave ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a superball can possess two types of shape anisotropy : cube - like shapes ( for @xmath34 ) and octahedron - like shapes ( for @xmath35 ) with a shape change from convexity to concavity as @xmath3 passes downward through @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath37{superdisks.eps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    @xmath38{superballs.eps } \\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    optimal packings of congruent superdisks and superballs apparently are realized by certain bravais lattices possessing symmetries consistent with those of the particles @xcite .",
    "even these crystalline packings exhibit rich characteristics that are distinctly different from other known packings of nonspherical particles . for example , we found that the maximal density @xmath39 as a function of @xmath3 at @xmath8 ( the sphere or circular - disk point ) is nonanalytic and increases dramatically as @xmath3 moves away from unity .",
    "in addition , we have discovered two - fold degenerate maximal density states for square - like superdisks , and both cube - like and octahedron - like superballs .    in this paper , we generate both packings of binary superdisks in @xmath40 and monodisperse superballs in @xmath13 that represent the maximally random jammed ( mrj ) state of these particles , using a novel event - driven molecular dynamics algorithm @xcite and investigate their characteristics . for both superdisks and superballs , we find that the corresponding density @xmath12 and the average contact number @xmath17 increase rapidly , in a cusp - like manner , as the particles deviate from perfect circular disks and spheres , respectively . in particular , we find that the mrj packing density @xmath12 increases monotonically as @xmath3 moves away from unity , and shows no signs of a plateau even for large @xmath3 values .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case of ellipsoids for which the packing density reaches a maximum as the aspect ratio ratio increases from its sphere - point value and then begins to decrease as the aspect ratio grows beyond that associated with the density - maximum value .",
    "moreover , we find that @xmath17 for superdisk and superball packings reach its associated plateau value at relatively small asphericity deviations ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) and the packings remain _ hypostatic _ for all values of @xmath3 examined . by `` hypostatic '' , we mean that the @xmath17 is smaller than twice the number of degrees of freedom per particle , compared to random ellipsoid packings where the plateau value of @xmath17 is only slightly below @xmath23 . therefore , to achieve jamming , the local particle arrangements are necessarily correlated in a nontrivial way .",
    "we call such correlated structures `` nongeneric '' @xcite .",
    "we quantify the degree of `` nongenericity '' of the packings by determining the fraction of local coordination configurations in which the central particles have fewer contacting neighbors than average @xmath17 .",
    "we also show that such `` nongeneric '' configurations are not rare , which is a rather counterintuitive conclusion .",
    "in addition , we find that although the rapid increase of density is unrelated to any observable translational order , the orientational order ( e.g. , the cubatic order parameter @xcite ) increases as @xmath3 moves away from unity .",
    "these packing characteristics , which are distinctly different from that of the mrj packings of ellipsoids , are due to the unique way in which rotational symmetry is broken in superdisk and superball packings .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe the simulation techniques and the obtained packings . in sec .",
    "iii , we provide a detailed analysis of the novel packing characteristics . in sec .",
    "iv , we make concluding remarks .",
    "we use an event - driven molecular dynamics packing algorithm recently developed by donev , torquato and stillinger @xcite ( henceforth , referred to as the dts algorithm ) to generate mrj packings of convex superdisks in two dimensions and superballs in three dimensions .",
    "the dts algorithm generalizes the lubachevsky - stillinger ( ls ) sphere - packing algorithm @xcite to the case of other centrally symmetric convex bodies ( e.g. , ellipsoids and superballs ) .",
    "initially , small particles are randomly distributed and randomly oriented in the simulation box ( fundamental cell ) with periodic boundary conditions and without any overlap .",
    "the particles are then given translational and rotational velocities randomly and their motion followed as they collide elastically and also expand uniformly with an expansion rate @xmath42 , while the fundamental cell deforms to better accommodate the configuration .",
    "after some time , a jammed state with a diverging collision rate is reached and the density reaches a local maximum value . to generate random jammed packings ,",
    "initially large @xmath42 are employed to prevent the system following the equilibrium branch of the phase diagram that leads to crystallization . near the jamming point ,",
    "sufficiently small expansion rate is necessary for the particles to establish contacting neighbor networks and to form a truly jammed packing . on the basis of our experience with spheres @xcite and ellipsoids @xcite , we believe that our algorithm with rapid particle expansion produces final states that represent the mrj state well . here",
    "we use the largest possible initial @xmath43 that is numerically feasible to ensure the generated superdisk and superball packings are maximally random jammed .",
    "we mainly focus on superdisks and superballs with deformation parameters @xmath3 within the range @xmath44 , since extreme values of @xmath3 associated with polyhedron - like shapes present numerical difficulties .",
    "all of the generated packings used in the subsequent analyses are verified to be at least collectively jammed using an `` infinitesimal shrinkage '' method @xcite , i.e. , the particles in the packing are shrunk by a very small amount @xcite and given random velocities .",
    "if no significant structural changes occur after the system `` relaxes '' after a sufficiently long enough time , the packing is considered to be collectively jammed .",
    "it is well established that the `` infinitesimal shrinkage '' method is robust , i.e. , it always gives the same results for sphere packings as those obtained from a rigorous linear programming jamming test algorithm provided the amount of shrinkage from the jammed state is sufficiently small for a given number of particles within the periodic cell @xcite .",

    "mrj packings generated in both two and three dimensions contain a small fraction of rattlers , i.e. , particles that can wander freely within cages formed by their jammed non - rattling neighbors .",
    "when @xmath3 is close to unity , the fraction of rattlers is approximately @xmath65 and @xmath66 for two and three dimensions , respectively . as @xmath3 moves away from unity , the fraction of rattlers decreases quickly and practically vanishes for large @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xmath67 ) .",
    "this behavior results from the increasing protuberance of the particle shape , which makes it more difficult to form isotropic cages and also requires more average contacts per particle to achieve jamming .",
    "note that rattlers are excluded when reporting average contact numbers in the following discussion .",
    "the rapid increase of the density is mainly due to the broken rotational symmetry of the particles . in particular , the cubic - like ( square - like ) and octahedral - like particles are more efficient to cover the space than spheres ( circular disks ) , i.e. , near the jamming point the particles can rotate to accommodate the neighbors by orienting the `` far corners '' to fill the available gaps and thus cover more space . for small values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the increase in @xmath12 is also attributed to the expected increase in the number of contacting neighbors per particle , which means locally more particles can be packed in a given volume .",
    "the manner in which rotational symmetry is broken in superball packings is distinctly different from that in ellipsoid packings .",
    "for example , the asphericity @xmath42 @xcite , defined as the ratio of the radii of circumsphere and insphere of a nonspherical particle , is always bounded and close to unity for all values of @xmath3 for superballs , while it can increase without limit as the largest aspect ratio @xmath22 grows for ellipsoids . for very elongated or flake - like ellipsoids with large aspect ratios , the effect of a very anisotropic exclusion volume becomes dominant and causes the density of random ellipsoid packings to decrease .",
    "by contrast , the shape of superballs becomes more efficient in filling space as the deformation parameter deviates more from unity and thus results in a monotonically increasing density .",
    "the nonanalyticity of @xmath12 at @xmath8 is also associated with the broken symmetry of superdisks and superballs .",
    "this nonanalytical behavior has also been observed in the optimal packings of these particles realized by various bravais lattices @xcite .",
    "this stands in contrast to the densest known ellipsoid packings , which are periodic packings with a two - particle basis possessing a smooth initial increase of @xmath39 as the aspect ratio moves away from unity @xcite .",
    "there have been conjectures @xcite that frictionless random packings have just enough constraints to completely statically define the system ( i.e. , it is _ isostatic _ ) , i.e. , for large packings , one has @xmath68 .",
    "it has been shown both experimentally and computationally that although the isostatic conjecture @xcite holds for large sphere packings @xcite , it is generally not applicable to nonspherical particles , such as ellipsoids @xcite .",
    "it was found that even for ellipsoids with large aspect ratios , @xmath17 is still slightly below @xmath23 @xcite .",

    "\\mbox{(a ) } & \\mbox{(b ) } \\end{array}$ ]    here we observe that in mrj packings of superdisks and superballs @xmath17 is significantly smaller than @xmath23 for all values of @xmath3 examined , i.e. , the packings are significantly _ hypostatic_. the hypostatic packings result from the competition between @xmath70 translational and @xmath71 rotational degrees of freedom of the particles ( @xmath72 ) in developing the contacting networks close to the jamming point .",
    "in particular , although it is true that to constrain the translational degrees of freedom each particle needs at least @xmath73 contacts , rotational degrees of freedom can be blocked with less than @xmath74 additional contacts per particle if the curvatures at the contacting points are sufficiently small @xcite . in addition , due to the relatively small asphericity @xmath42 of superdisks and superballs , there is little reason to expect the rotational motions of these particles ( especially those with @xmath3 close to unity ) would be frozen even when they are translational trapped and may only rattle inside small `` cages '' formed by their neighbors . near the jamming point , it is expected that the particles can rotate significantly @xcite until the actual jamming point is reached , at which rotational jamming will also come into play , and rotational degrees of freedom are frozen with the number of additional contacts much less than @xmath74 .",
    "this is in contrast to hypostatic mrj packings of ellipsoids with large aspect ratios , for which the translational and rotational degrees of freedom are on the same footing and , thus , the average contact number per particle is only slightly below twice the number of total degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , the local geometry of the mrj packings is necessarily nontrivially correlated ( nongeneric ) , i.e. , all the normal vectors at the points of contact for a particle should intersect at a common point to achieve torque balance and block rotations . in light of the isostatic conjecture ,",
    "the local packing structures are less nongeneric when they possess larger contact numbers so that the constraining neighbors are less correlated .",
    "the truly generic local packing structures should have @xmath68 per particle , for which the constraining neighbors could be completely uncorrelated . to characterize the `` nongenericity '' of the packings , we compute @xmath75 , the fraction of local structures composed of particles with less contacts @xmath76 than average @xmath77 , i.e. ,    @xmath78    a larger @xmath75 indicates a larger degree of nongenericity .",
    "we find @xmath75 is approximately 0.65 in two dimensions and 0.78 in three dimensions when @xmath3 is close to unity , which quickly decreases and plateaus at 0.6 and 0.68 , respectively as @xmath3 increases .",
    "figure  [ generic ] shows the distribution of contact numbers for different @xmath3 values and the topology of the local structures contributing to @xmath75 .",
    "it can be seen that as @xmath3 moves away from unity , the distributions become more skewed as the means shift to larger @xmath17 . moreover , the subset of particles associated with the nongeneric structures do not percolate .",
    "we do not observe any tendency of increasing @xmath17 even for the largest @xmath3 values that are computationally feasible and we expect that mrj packings in the cubic limit are also hypostatic .",
    "it is noteworthy that isostatic random packings of superdisks and superballs are difficult to construct , since achieving isostaticity requires @xmath79 which is necessarily associated with translational crystallization @xcite .",

    "in particular , a nonspherical particle can be rotationally jammed if it has neighbors that can translationally jam the particle @xcite . to illustrate this point",
    ", we will consider a small packing composed of four superdisks in two dimensions .",
    "now we show that one can locally jam a superdisk by three contacting neighbor superdisks .",
    "translational jamming requires that the centroids of the neighbors can not lie in the same semi - circle around the centroid of the central superdisk .",
    "suppose a superdisk is translationally trapped ( not jammed ) by its three neighbors , whose positions and orientations are fixed .",
    "this four - particle configuration has four degrees of freedom : two translational and one rotational degrees of freedom of the trapped particle as well as the expansion of the particles . to obtain a jammed configuration ,",
    "the four degrees of freedom need to be completely constrained . this can be achieved by the three contact conditions for the jammed particles and its neighbors and the requirement that the three inward normal vectors at the contacting points meet at a common point , a sufficient condition for torque balance @xcite .",
    "thus , one has four independent equations for the four degrees of freedom ; see the appendix for details .    figure  [ local ] shows the nongeneric jammed configurations associated with three specific fixed trapping superdisks .",
    "the multiplicity of the configurations is due to the multiple solutions of the equations .",
    "the jamming configurations can be also obtained using the dts algorithm , which allows the trapped particle to translate and rotate and allows all the particles to grow .",
    "although the above analysis is for local jamming ( i.e. , the neighbors of the central particle are fixed ) , it is reasonable to expect that collective particle rearrangements further facilitate the formation of nontrivial orientational correlations and thus , enable a larger number of nongeneric jamming configurations .",
    "indeed , the numerous hypostatic jammed packings that we found from our simulations strengthen our argument that nongeneric structures are not rare .",
    "we also observe the increase of the orientational order ( measured by @xmath54 ) associated with the increasing @xmath3 values , although the largest possible expansion rate @xmath42 has been used to suppress the formation of orders ( i.e. , to maintain the maximal degree of randomness ) @xcite .",
    "as @xmath3 deviates from unity , the particle shape develops `` edges '' and `` corners '' with large curvatures , which may not be able to block rotational unjamming motions if contacts occur at significantly curved regions of the particle surface . on the other hand ,",
    "low - curvature contacts are more favorable , which is associated with partial alignments of the particles . the tendency of particle alignments to form low - curvature surface contacts required by jamming becomes stronger as the particle moves further away from the sphere point .",
    "thus , there is also a competition between orientational disorder and jamming for packings of superdisks and superballs , resulting from their unique symmetry - breaking manner , which has not been observed in random packings of ellipsoids . due to numerical difficulties",
    ", we could not use the dts algorithm to study the random jammed packings of particles with extreme shapes , i.e. , in the limit @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "however , it reasonable to expect considerable orientational ordering in such packings .",
    "in this paper , we studied the maximally random jammed packings of superdisks and superballs .",
    "the packing densities increase dramatically and nonanalytically as one moves away from the circular - disk and sphere point ( @xmath8 ) and the packings are hypostatic . to achieve jamming , the local arrangements of particles are necessarily non - trivially correlated and we term these structures `` nongeneric '' in light of the correlations .",
    "the degree of `` nongenericity '' of the packings is quantitatively characterized by the fraction of local structures composed of particles with less contacts than average .",
    "moreover , we showed that such seemingly `` special '' packing configurations are not rare .",
    "as the anisotropy of the particles increases , the fraction of rattlers decreases while the minimal orientational order increases .",
    "the novel features arising in mrj packings of superdisks and superballs result from the unique manner in which rotational symmetry is broken .",
    "this makes such packings distinctly different from other known mrj packings of nonspherical particles , such ellipsoids and ellipses .",
    "the ability to produce dense random packings using superballs casts new lights on several industrial processes , such as sintering and ceramic formation , where interest exists in increasing the density of powder particles to be fused .",
    "if superball - like particles instead of spherical particles are used , the packing density of a randomly poured and compacted powder could be increased to a value surpassing that of the maximal sphere - packing density .",
    "we note that superdisks and superballs can be experimentally mass produced using current lithography techniques .",
    "understanding the statistical thermodynamics of the jamming transition of superdisks and superballs , especially the role of rotational and translational degrees of freedom for different deformation parameters is a subject that merits future investigation .",
    "such studies could may our understanding of the nature of glass transitions , since the preponderance of previous investigations have focused on spherical particles .",
    "in this section , we provide the equations that determine locally jammed four - superdisk configurations composed of a trapped central particle and three fixed contacting neighbors ( see fig .  [ local ] ) . in particular , the boundary of a superdisk with radius @xmath83 is define by    @xmath84    which can be also expressed by the parametric equations    @xmath85    where @xmath86 gives the sign of argument @xmath87 .",

    "( [ eqa01 ] ) and ( [ eqa04 ] ) , the contact point @xmath95 between neighbor particle @xmath96 and the central particle can be expressed in terms of @xmath97 , which must also lie on the boundary of the neighboring particle @xmath96 , i.e. ,    @xmath98    for @xmath99 .",
    "this leads to three equations in the variables @xmath100 , and @xmath83 .",

    "the fact that the superdisks and superballs can significantly explore their configurational space associated with the rotational degrees of freedom , i.e. , they can rotate significantly , near the jamming point is manifested as long - period oscillations of the pressure of the system , which is also observed for ellipsoid systems .      expansion rates @xmath42 within the range @xmath111 were employed to suppress the formation of order in the superdisk and superball packings ; larger @xmath42 would cause numerical instability of the dts algorithm . note that for ellipsoids , @xmath112 is sufficient to produce random packings with vanishing orientational order @xcite ."

    "<S> dense random packings of hard particles are useful models of granular media and are closely related to the structure of nonequilibrium low - temperature amorphous phases of matter . </S>",
    "<S> most work has been done for random jammed packings of spheres , and it is only recently that corresponding packings of nonspherical particles ( e.g. , ellipsoids ) have received attention . here </S>",
    "<S> we report a study of the maximally random jammed ( mrj ) packings of binary superdisks and monodispersed superballs whose shapes are defined by @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , where @xmath3 is the deformation parameter with values in the interval @xmath4 . as @xmath3 increases from zero </S>",
    "<S> , one can get a family of both concave ( @xmath5 ) and convex ( @xmath6 ) particles with square symmetry ( @xmath1 ) , or octahedral and cubic symmetry ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for @xmath8 the particle is a perfect sphere ( circular disk ) and for @xmath9 the particle is a perfect cube ( square ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mrj densities of such packings increase dramatically and nonanalytically as one moves away from the circular - disk and sphere point ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the disordered packings are hypostatic , i.e. , the average number of contacting neighbors is less than twice the total number of degrees of freedom per particle , and the packings are mechanically stable . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the local arrangements of particles are necessarily nontrivially correlated to achieve jamming . </S>",
    "<S> we term such correlated structures `` nongeneric '' . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of `` nongenericity '' of the packings is quantitatively characterized by determining the fraction of local coordination structures in which the central particles have fewer contacting neighbors than average . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that such seemingly `` special '' packing configurations are counterintuitively not rare . as the anisotropy of the particles increases , the fraction of rattlers decreases while the minimal orientational order as measured by the cubatic order metric increases . </S>",
    "<S> these novel characteristics result from the unique rotational symmetry breaking manner of the particles , which also makes the superdisk and superball packings distinctly different from other known nonspherical hard - particle packings . </S>"
