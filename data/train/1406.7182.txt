    "few concepts in nature are so simple and yet as profound as those related to symmetry .",
    "indeed , the beauty of its manifestations has led to the modern view that principles of symmetry dictate the forms of nature s fundamental laws@xcite , embodying striking implications that range from conservation principles to the classification of elementary particles .",
    "time reversal symmetry ( trs ) is a prominent example that underlies a large variety of phenomena . in many instances , the fundamental microscopic laws of nature",
    "are invariant under time reversal transformations .",
    "this invariance is at the heart of microscopic reversibility ( microreversibility)@xcite , which itself is crucial to powerful concepts such as the principle of detailed balance@xcite , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite , and fluctuation relations ( e.g. tasaki - crooks fluctuation theorem)@xcite , to name a few .",
    "yet trs is not an exact symmetry of nature : in the very least , it is observed to be broken in elementary processes that involve the weak interaction@xcite , and moreover , there is evidence to suggest that it must also be violated over a much broader range of conditions in order to account for the prevalence of matter over anti - matter in the universe@xcite .",
    "manifestations of such violations potentially herald new phenomena and are thus the subject of extensive experimental investigations in both atomic and particle physics@xcite .",
    "while considerable effort has been invested in the search for violations of trs in the interactions of fundamental particles , experiments have not been conducted to investigate trs in the physics of quantum systems at the macroscopic scale .",
    "specifically , the question thus arises : once one properly takes into account dissipative and decoherence effects , would trs be observed in , say , a mesoscopic or even a macroscopic device ? on the face of it , there is no reason to expect that it breaks down : we know the microscopic laws of quantum mechanics can be applied to at least some ( properly prepared ) macroscopic systems .",
    "nonetheless , if it does break down , this must reflect new physics , which could have potential connections to open questions like the nature of the quantum - classical divide@xcite .    with these thoughts in mind",
    ", we delineate here a protocol for directly testing trs in an artificial atom that is based upon a superconducting quantum device ( sqd ) .",
    "while similar types of sqds are known for their use as qubits in the development of quantum computing architectures@xcite , we propose to utilize an sqd as a multi - level artificial atom to test a specific manifestation of trs , namely the principle of microreversibility .",
    "generally speaking , the principle of microreversibility states that for each process ( or trajectory in state space ) that is accessible to a given system , there is an equally probable time - reversed process that the system can undergo@xcite . in the context of quantum mechanics",
    ", it manifests in a simple relationship for the transition probabilities between any two states of a system whose hamiltonian has undergone a time - dependent transformation@xcite , namely that @xmath0=p_{n|m}[\\tilde{\\lambda } ] \\label{mr}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the probability for the system to make a transition to state @xmath2 when it starts in state @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 represents the forward - in - time transformation of the system s hamiltonian and @xmath5 represents the motion - reversed process ( fig .",
    "it is important to note that the standard presentations of trs ( and consequently microreversibility ) are done in the context of nondriven conservative systems @xcite .",
    "as shown in appendix a , the microreversibility principle can be readily adapted to include driven hamiltonians , where the key element for recovering the standard relations consists in the temporal inversion of the hamiltonian s temporal sequence@xcite .",
    "equation [ mr ] is a fundamental and general result for non - dissipative quantum mechanical systems , deriving from the invariance of a system s hamiltonian under transformations by the anti - unitary time - reversal operator @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thus it should hold true for all quantum systems in which trs is maintained .",
    "naively , one would expect this to include macroscopic systems for which the laws of quantum mechanics have been shown to apply , such as mechanical quantum systems@xcite and superconducting cavities , circuits and devices@xcite .",
    "however , a direct test of trs in these systems has yet to be performed .    concerning the role played by the macroscopic nature of the system , it is worthy of mentioning that the test of trs we envision here has a different perspective than those conducted in other condensed matter systems .",
    "in fact , while here we want to address the emergence of trs in quantum systems whose dynamics necessarily have to be described by the superposition of macroscopically distinct states or , at least , by a collective variable which obeys quantum mechanical laws , other studies have utilized macroscopic systems in order to magnify possible effects due to microscopic time - reversal violations@xcite .",
    "one example is the search for permanent electric dipole moment ( edm ) of elementary particles@xcite through measurements of the bulk magnetization of a macroscopic collection of spins@xcite .",
    "such experiments exploit the macroscopic size of the sample to significantly improve the signal acquisition , which is used to set limits on the existence of such permanent edms , allowing one to draw conclusions about the fundamental time - reversal invariance of the constituent elementary particles ; by contrast , in our proposal , we conceive testing time - reversal invariance in the dynamics of a macroscopic degree of freedom representing the collective behavior of the constituent particles .    as we show now",
    ", it should be technologically feasible to perform a test of microreversibility , and hence trs , via eq .",
    "[ mr ] , in an artificial atom based upon an sqd , whose quantum dynamics is associated with circuit excitations , characterized by superpositions of several charge states .",
    "the sqd here is a cooper - pair box ( cpb ) , which in our proposal consists of a nanofabricated superconducting island ( or box ) that is formed by a pair of josephson junctions in a dc squid configuration ( fig .",

[ hamiltonian",
    "] represents the mixing of charge states due to the josephson coupling of each junction . here",
    "@xmath11 is the total josephson energy of the two junctions ; observe that @xmath12 is periodic in applied magnetic flux @xmath13 with a period of one flux quantum @xmath14 . to account for asymmetry between the junctions",
    ", we define the parameter @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the sum of the individual junction josephson energies @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is important to note that numerous experiments over the past 15 years have shown that the two parameters @xmath13 and @xmath9 in eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] can be tuned _ in situ _ for experimental implementation of unitary operations with the cpb @xcite .",
    "the proposal we put forth for testing eq . [ mr ] exploits this coherent control .",
    "specifically , it relies upon the adjustment of @xmath13 and @xmath9 to modify the characteristics of the cpb s energy eigenstates . to understand how this might work ,",
    "observe that , when @xmath13 is adjusted so that @xmath19 is relatively small ( i.e @xmath20 ) , and @xmath9 is adjusted near an integer , the eigenstates of the system are essentially the charge states @xmath21 . on the other hand , if @xmath22 , or @xmath9 is near a half - integer , then the eigenstates are no longer well - defined charge states , but instead are weighted superpositions of multiple values of @xmath21 .",
    "thus , through the rapid tuning of @xmath13 and @xmath9 , the cpb can be forced to undergo unitary evolution between various superpositions of charge states . through repeated projective measurements of the cpb s",
    "charge state before @xmath23 and after @xmath24 identical forcing protocols , the transition probabilities @xmath25 between any given pair of charge states @xmath21 and @xmath26 in the spectral decompositions of the initial and final states can be constructed .    at this point",
    "it should be stressed that the kind of quantum states we envision using in our protocol to test trs are not strictly speaking macroscopic in the same sense as the so - called  cat states \" @xcite .",
    "whereas the latter are also present in superconducting devices when one studies , say , macroscopic quantum coherence in flux qubits or engineers entanglement between a superconducting microwave cavity and transmon qubit@xcite , the quantum state of the cpb in our protocol may involve the superposition of only a few charge states . nevertheless , this device is macroscopic in the sense that it is an engineered system consisting of billions of atoms ; and it is thus remarkable that a single collective variable still describes the dynamics of the device through genuine superpositions of its eigenstates .",
    "moreover , it is also worth mentioning that although these states are susceptible to the influence of external interactions , one can operate the system under conditions(see below ) which strongly reduce it and , therefore , safely describe its dynamics as unitary .",
    "our specific proposal to test eq . [ mr ] is outlined in figs .",
    "it involves the application of two separate protocols to the cpb to measure @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] , which we refer to as the forward ( @xmath4 ) protocol and the backward ( @xmath5 ) protocol respectively . for process @xmath4",
    ", the cpb is taken through the following sequence of steps : ( 1 ) first , with the external physical parameters set such that the energy eigenstates are definite charge states ( i.e. @xmath29 ) , the cpb is initialized in its ground state and driven by a pulse sequence consisting of the simultaneous application of time - varying signals @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( figs .",
    "2c - d ) , causing it to repeatedly pass through avoided - level crossings in its energy spectrum ( fig .",
    "at each such crossing , the cpb can undergo a landau - zener transition@xcite between the adjacent states involved in the crossing , which leaves it in a superposition of those two states .",
    "for the parameters considered here , after traversing the multiple crossings shown in fig .",
    "2e , the cpb state should be in a superposition of as many as 5 charge states .",
    "it should be noted that at the end of the sweep , @xmath9 and @xmath13 are brought back to their initial values so that once again @xmath29 .",
    "( 2 ) at this point , immediately after the initial superposition state is prepared , a projective measurement of the cpb s charge is made and recorded as state @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to those steps as the preparation protocol ( figs .",
    "2a - b ) , since they provide an effective way for preparing an initial ensemble of charge states which can be used for measuring @xmath25 -in our case , its composition is given in ( fig .",
    "( 3 ) next , after the collapse to the charge state @xmath21 , a second pulse sequence identical to the sequence in step ( 1 ) is applied , again preparing the cpb in a superposition of charge states .",
    "( 4 ) finally , a second projective measurement of the cpb charge state is made and recorded as @xmath32 .",
    "after step ( 4 ) , the cpb is allowed sufficient time to relax back to its ground state , after which time @xmath4 is repeated . in this manner , repeating @xmath4 many times , the transitions probabilities @xmath27 $ ] can be constructed . figure 3b illustrates a histogram of @xmath27 $ ] for this process calculated with numerical simulations using eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] and the pulse sequences in figs .",
    "2c - d ( see appendix b ) .    to implement the time - reversed process @xmath5 and construct the corresponding transition probabilities @xmath28 $ ] , the same general procedure as outlined in the previous paragraph is followed .",
    "however , it is necessary to change two physical quantities for the time - reversed process : first , the sign of the magnetic flux applied to the cpb must be reversed to account for the reversal of momentum of the magnetic field s source charges .",
    "observe that such inversion leads to @xmath33 .",
    "then , since the time reversal operator is an antilinear operator ( see appendix a ) , the system hamiltonian is left invariant when taking the time reversal transformation together with the magnetic field sign change .",
    "second , one should also invert the sign of the appropriate canonical variable of the cpb during @xmath5 , which in this case turns out to be the effective phase difference @xmath34 across the cpb s josephson junctions . even though we have already found that the hamiltonian is left invariant under the joint action of the time reversal operator and the magnetic field inversion ,",
    "this step must be done in order to preserve the time - reversal invariance of the canonical charge - phase commutation relations , since charge is considered an invariant under trs .",
    "furthermore , not performing such a transformation makes the time reversal transformation of the supercurrent density ill defined ( see appendix a ) . in our particular case , inverting the sign of @xmath34 together with the antilinear transformation due to the time reversal operation has the effect of conjugating @xmath35 in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] . therefore , together with as one would expect , applying those two changes leaves the system hamiltonian invariant .",
    "in addition , since we have a time - dependent hamiltonian ( nonautonomous system)@xcite , we also have to revert the forcing protocol applied to the system , i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . with these changes , numerical simulations of the backward protocol",
    "indeed predict that eq .",
    "1 should hold ( fig .",
    "to claim a true test of trs through verification of microreversibility ( eq . [ mr ] ) , it is essential that the cpb s time evolution be predominantly unitary during the @xmath4 and @xmath5 protocols .",
    "this requires that the protocols be implemented on a time scale @xmath38 that is much faster than any environmental effects . by applying the methodology introduced by burkard - koch - divincenzo@xcite",
    ", one finds that the figure of merit for quantifying such effects in our protocol is the relaxation time @xmath39 . from those estimations , it can be shown that the decoherence time @xmath40 is determined by @xmath39 ( @xmath41 ) , except for the regime @xmath29 , which corresponds to a tiny window of @xmath42 in the protocol , during which @xmath43 ( see appendix c ) .",
    "thus , even for a modest @xmath39 of 50ns , which is readily achievable with current technology@xcite , the designed protocol with @xmath44 ( figs .",
    "2a - b ) should provide a satisfactory unitary evolution .",
    "it is also important that the projective charge measurements are made within a time - scale @xmath45 .",
    "that @xmath39 sets the relevant time - scale can be understood by realizing that decoherence effects becomes innocuous if one chooses projective measurements in the eigenenergy basis , since such effects would not lead to changes in the system state eigenenergy spectral decomposition .",
    "notice from fig . 2d that our protocol complies with this case : at the end of a protocol , when a projective measurement of charge is made , the cpb is biased so that the charge states are quasi - eigenenergy states of the system ( i.e. @xmath29 ) .",
    "indeed , for the parameters chosen here ( fig .",
    "1 ) , each eigenenergy state has a probability larger than @xmath46 of being found in a specific charge state .",
    "hence these measurements should also each be performed on a time scale @xmath47 . a natural and viable possibility for performing such high - speed",
    ", high - sensitivity charge measurements would be to use a superconducting single electron transistor ( sset)@xcite . when operated in rf mode , ssets can have bandwidth in excess of 100 mhz @xcite and charge detection sensitivity approaching the limit allowed by quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "indeed , assuming the detection sensitivity achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite , it should be possible to resolve the cpb s charge state with an error of @xmath48 in a time scale of @xmath49 ( see appendix d ) .",
    "such an error sets the precision limit for our proposal , since those due to the relaxation and dephasing processes impose a loss of state fidelity of the order of @xmath50}\\sim-\\int_0^{\\tau_p}{dt / t_{(1,2)}(t)}$ ] , for the short gate times under consideration .",
    "using @xmath39 and @xmath40 time dependence determined@xcite for our protocol , one finds that the state fidelity degrades by @xmath51 ( relaxation ) and @xmath52(dephasing ) , by setting the conservative @xmath39 minimum value as @xmath53 .",
    "in addition to testing trs in new macroscopic quantum limits , the investigations that we have outlined here would have implications for at least one contemporary avenue of investigation : quantum work fluctuation theorems . indeed ,",
    "to derive these theorems , it is necessary to make two hypotheses : the microreversibility principle and the assumption that the system is initially in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath54 ( a gibbsian distribution)@xcite .",
    "one paradigm of such work fluctuation theorems is the quantum bochkov - kuzovlev fluctuation theorem between the forward and backward work probability distribution functions ( pdf)@xcite @xmath55}{p[-w;\\tilde{\\lambda}]}=e^{w / k_bt}. \\label{pdf}\\ ] ] such a relation states that , when leaving an initial thermal equilibrium state , the system dynamics features a probability bias in favor of events for which work is done on the system ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) can been seen as a manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics , since it shows that energy releasing events are exponentially suppressed compared to energy absorbing events .",
    "the relation ( [ pdf ] ) resembles very much the tasaki - crooks theorem@xcite , for which the bias factor is @xmath57 $ ] , where @xmath58 is the free energy difference between equilibrium thermal states associated with the system initial and final conditions .",
    "those theorems are derived assuming different definitions of work , where one ( bochkov - kuzovlev ) associates work with the change in energy of the system unforced hamiltonian , and the other relates it to changes in energy of the total system hamiltonian ( see appendix e ) .",
    "observe that both theorems give the same result for cyclical processes such as the protocol that we have proposed in this work .",
    "it is important to stress that fluctuation theorems like eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) are capable of determining the relative frequency with each of such events happen , which is a level of detail not provided by the standard thermodynamics approach of obtaining information from ensemble averages .",
    "such a feature has been explored to understand and try to design quantum thermal machines@xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of eq .",
    "( [ pdf ] ) is the bochkov - kuzovlev equality @xmath59@xcite , which clearly shows the power and the generality of the results derived from fluctuation theorems : independently of the specifications of the driving protocol and the characteristics of the system , the work distribution of any driving protocol applied to any system initially in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath54 is a random distribution , having the same expected value for the functional @xmath60 .    to investigate quantum fluctuation theorems , like eq .",
    "[ pdf ] , using an sqd would require running an experiment at very low temperature ( @xmath61 ) , in which case the sqd s initial thermal state is predominantly the population of the system ground state .",
    "unfortunately this leads to very poor statistics for eq .",
    "[ pdf ] . in principle",
    ", this problem could be solved by just increasing the system temperature , but in order to obtain a gibbsian distribution comprised of a reasonable number of states , e.g. , 5 states , one should perform the experiment at @xmath62 , at which temperature the sqd could no longer be well - approximated as a non - dissipative quantum system undergoing purely unitary evolution .    here",
    ", we envision a solution to this problem by constructing a thermal state out of the initial charge ensemble obtained in the preparation protocol , which we name an emulation of an initial gibbs ensemble .",
    "the procedure consists of randomly selecting the outcomes of the first measurement following the probability rule imposed by the boltzmann weight @xmath63 .",
    "if the number of experimental events is sufficiently large , such distribution can be obtained for a given temperature @xmath54 . indeed , as fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and table [ tab ] show , for @xmath64 events , one can emulate a gibbs ensemble comprised of those 5 states for temperatures above @xmath65 , leading to @xmath66 possible different values of work , and verify with a small statistical error due to the sampling , which scales as @xmath67 , the quantum bochkov - kuzovlev theorem and equality ( see appendix e ) .    considering that , as presented to date",
    ", the system evolution in a quantum fluctuation theorem verification has to be disconnected from its environment during the forcing protocol , if one is not capable of monitoring the environment s state , the role played by the initial gibbs ensemble in a such experimental verification is just to provide a set of initial states with their frequencies of appearance weighted by the boltzmann factor - no system - environment correlation is maintained during single runs and between different runs of the experiment .",
    "thus , the ensemble emulation can be viewed playing the same role as a truly initial gibbs ensemble in a quantum fluctuation theorem verification : a simple provider of uncorrelated initial states , the frequency of which is weighted by a know factor .",
    "moreover , the emulation program can provide means to explore sqds as quantum thermal machines@xcite .",

    "in the present paper we have created a protocol for the preparation , time evolution and measurement of the quantum state of an sqd in order to test trs in a new regime , namely in macroscopic quantum dynamics , using current technology and techniques .",
    "our numerical simulations show that the repeated application of this protocol to the sqd would enable verification of the microreversibility principle in an artificial atom .    aside from being of fundamental importance to both equilibrium and non - equilibrium statistical mechanics",
    ", such a result would have the immediate consequence of verifying quantum fluctuation theorems via the construction of work probability distribution functions .",
    "this has been the subject of intense interest since the first proposals for determining the work pdf in quantum systems were put forth@xcite .",
    "recently the first experimental verifications have been accomplished in nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite and ion trap@xcite systems , but yet remaining an outstanding task for artificial atoms .",
    "in addition , several works have put forward the idea of inferring the work pdf using approaches that eliminate either the need of implementing successive projective energy measurements or the requirement of having an environment - isolated system dynamics - such as using ramsey interferometry performed on an ancilla system@xcite , single projective measurements of observables@xcite , quantum jump measurements of a system and its environment in open quantum systems@xcite , or implementing the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) technique @xcite . notwithstanding that those approaches can represent great improvement for determining the work pdf in many systems ,",
    "when considering the dynamics of macroscopic quantum states , the demand for the capability of either i ) maintaining an auxiliary quantum system coherently coupled to the system of interest during the measurement protocol@xcite , ii ) restricting the investigation to sudden quench processes of specific initial states@xcite , or iii ) monitoring the environment s state in order to analyze the system - environment energy exchange@xcite , may constitute requirements as difficult as the original task of performing successive projective energy measurements , in which our proposal is based on .    although one could argue that our results are formally expected , their experimental observation would be of utmost importance and , apart from what we have said above , the reason is threefold .",
    "firstly , it would provide the first direct test of the microreversibility of transitions between the states of a macroscopic quantum system .",
    "secondly , it could further our understanding of how collective variables couple to their environment and lead to new techniques to enhance the reliability of decoupling from environmental degrees of freedom .",
