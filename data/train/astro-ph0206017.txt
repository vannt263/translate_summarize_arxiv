    "convective instabilities have been invoked to help drive core - collapse supernova explosions since epstein ( 1979 ) first argued that negative lepton gradients would drive ledoux convection in the core .",
    "epstein ( 1979 ) argued that this convection would increase the transport of energy out of the core and help facilitate a supernova explosion .",
    "bruenn , buchler , & livio ( 1979 ) confirmed that this convection could indeed increase the neutrino luminosity and help drive a supernova explosion . considerable work studying convective instabilities , including multi - dimensional models ( e.g. buchler , livio , & colgate 1980 ) , followed soon after .",
    "although entropy gradients caused by the shock were suggested during this time ( see bruenn , buchler , & livio 1979 ) , burrows ( 1987 ) first suggested that this entropy - driven convection could also boost the neutrino luminosity and help drive a supernova explosion .",
    "the work of the past two decades has led to two separate convective regions : one within the extremely dense proto - neutron star core ( see keil , janka , & mller 1996 for a review ) and the other in the region between the proto - neutron star and the accretion shock where the bounce stalled . in this latter region ,",
    "neutrino heating powers an unstable entropy gradient that drives convection ( see bethe 1990 for a review ) . in the dense proto - neutron star , convection driven by lepton gradients ( epstein 1979 , keil et al .",
    "1996 ) , entropy gradients ( burrows 1987 , burrows & lattimer 1988 ) , and doubly diffusive ( `` salt - finger '' ) instabilities ( mayle & wilson 1988 ) have all been invoked to increase the neutrino luminosity and hence , the neutrino heating . in the neutrino heating region",
    ", entropy - driven convection helps to convert thermal energy gained from neutrino heating into kinetic energy , improving the over - all efficiency at which neutrinos from the core deposit energy into the outer layers of the star .",
    "this latter convection has been studied in a number of 2-dimensional simulations over the last decade @xcite .",
    "this entropy driven convection occurs shortly after the collapse of the massive star .",
    "when this core reaches nuclear densities and nuclear forces rapidly raise the pressure , its collapse halts , sending a bounce shock through the star .",
    "this bounce shock stalls and leaves behind an unstable entropy profile that seeds convection in the region between the proto - neutron star and the edge of the stalled supernova shock .",
    "neutrinos leak out from the proto - neutron star and heat this region , continuing to drive this entropy - driven convection .",
    "it is this convection that many groups now agree helps drive the supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "however , due to limitations in computer hardware and simulation software , all of the past work was limited to 2-dimensional simulations , leaving behind a number of unanswered questions .",
    "whether or not this increased efficiency is sufficient to drive a supernova explosion with the current supernova mechanisms is still a matter of debate : compare the explosions of @xcite and @xcite to the fizzles of @xcite .",
    "a key uncertainty in all of these simulations lies in the fact that the 2-dimensional simulations are being used to study an inherently 3-dimensional event in nature .",
    "some scientists have argued that nature will produce convective instabilities that are much different than what we see in the current 2-dimensional simulations . in other convective problems ( e.g. novae )",
    "it has been found that 2-dimensional models of these inherently 3-dimensional processes can lead to vastly incorrect answers ( compare the differences between the 2- and 3-dimensional work of kercek , hillebrandt , & truran 1998 , 1999 ) .    in this letter , we present the first complete 3-dimensional simulations of the evolution of a massive star from collapse to explosion , with particular emphasis on the differences between 2 and 3-dimensional models of the entropy - driven convection .",
    "we follow these simulations until a strong supernova shock has been launched , and can hence see how these differences affect the final explosion energy , remnant mass , and nucleosynthetic yield of these supernovae .",
    "our collapse simulations use the smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique with the parallel tree algorithm developed by @xcite . to this parallel code",
    ", we have added the equation of state and neutrino physics from the supernova code developed by @xcite .",
    "the equation of state uses the nuclear equation of state by @xcite at high densities and the @xcite equation of state at low densities .",
    "nuclear burning is approximated by a nuclear statistical equilibrium scheme @xcite .",
    "the neutrino transport is mediated by the single energy flux - limiter developed by @xcite with appropriate geometrical factors for 3-dimensional models .",
    "details and tests of this code are described in @xcite . to facilitate comparison with past 2-dimensional simulations @xcite ,",
    "the gravity is calculated assuming a spherically symmetric potential .",
    "our progenitor is the standard 15m@xmath0 star ( s15s7b2 ) produced by @xcite . by using the same equation of state for low densities used by @xcite",
    ", we can seamlessly map these 1-dimensional progenitors into our 3-dimensional collapse code . to study the convection in detail , we have run 3 core - collapse simulations this progenitor with a range of resolutions from 300,000 to 3 million particles ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we compare these simulations to past 2-dimensional simulations which have the same physics implementations @xcite to determine the differences between 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional models of convection and more fully understand the role convection plays in the supernova mechanism .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of models a , b , and c 75ms after bounce .",
    "the isosurface shows material with radial velocities of 1000kms@xmath1 and outlines the outward moving convective bubbles . between this surface",
    "lies the convective downflows .",
    "note that even in the high resolution runs , the total number of bubbles is low , roughly consistent with the number of modes one might expect from the 2-dimensional simulations . a 2-dimensional slice of model b ( fig .",
    "2 ) reveals convective overturns which are very similar to the 2-dimensional simulations ( see fryer 1999 ) .",
    "the 3-dimensional simulations produce nearly the same neutrino fluxes and energies that were found in the 2-dimensional simulations ( fig .",
    "although this is not surprising because the transport methods were identical ( except for geometrical factors ) , it does show that the small differences in the convective motions do not seem to dramatically affect the neutrino emission .",
    "given that the 3-dimensional simulations appear similar to the 2-dimensional simulations , it is not surprising that most of the quantitative results between these simulations are the same .",
    "the ultimate explosion energy , explosion times , and remnant masses are all within 10% of each other .",
    "although on the surface , the amount of neutron rich ejecta is similar , the 3-dimensional simulations produce more extremely low ( @xmath2 ) ejecta than the 2-dimensional models , and 3-dimensional models , if anything , exacerbate the problem of ejecting too much neutron rich material .",
    "although the structure of the entropy - driven convection in core - collapse supernova is definitely 3-dimensional , there is close resemblance between our 3-dimensional simulations and past 2-dimensional simulations .",
    "this suggests that , for the accuracy currently needed in supernova simulations , 2-dimensional models may be sufficient to determine the convective enhancement to the neutrino - driven supernova mechanism .",
    "certainly , the uncertainties in the nuclear equation of state and in the neutrino cross - sections and transport are much larger than the uncertainties caused by assuming 2-dimensional convection .",
    "the fact that the 3-dimensional models continue to produce too much neutron rich ejecta implies that there still persists missing pieces to the supernova puzzle ( probably the neutrino transport , neutrino cross - sections , and equation of state are all culprits ) .",
    "our simulations are designed to study the nature of the convection above the proto - neutron star in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the convection arising in our 3-dimensional simulations shows a remarkable resemblance to 2-dimensional core - collapse simulations . unlike the nova simulations of kercek , hillebrandt , & truran ( 1998 , 1999 ) , the structure , extent and energetics of the convection in core - collapse simulations are the same in 2 and 3-dimensions",
    ".    we can not stress enough the fact that the numbers provided in this paper are not final answers to the collapse of a 15m@xmath0 star . with better neutrino transport techniques , neutrino cross - sections and equations of state , these values will change .",
    "however , changes in the neutrino physics and equation of state are unlikely to change the nature of the convection above the proto - neutron star . unless the nature of the convection changes dramatically with these improvements ,",
    "our 3-dimensional models show that the convection above the proto - neutron star in core - collapse supernovae is modeled accurately in 2-dimensions . indeed , for the level of convection arising from our simulations of the core - collapse of a 15m@xmath0 star , we find that 2-dimensional models are sufficiently accurate to model the supernova mechanism",
    ". of course , 3-dimensional models will still be essential for studies of inherently 3-dimensional aspects of core - collapse ( neutron star kicks , gravitational wave emission , etc . ) .",
    "note also , that for these simulations ( where the gravity is set to be spherically symmetric ) , there are no large asymmetries in the explosion .",
    "because there are so many convective modes , it is unlikely that any large asymmetry will develop without some large - scale force driving that asymmetry ( e.g. asymmetries in the neutrino emission or initial collapse conditions ) .",
    "it is possible that the convection will reduce to fewer modes for those explosions with long delays ( janka - pvt . communication ) .",
    "if so , it may be possible to produce the observed neutron star kicks .",
    "but with the current models , convection alone can not explain the large neutron star kicks . in future work",
    ", we will address these asymmetry issues by modeling with full gravity and considering changes to the initial conditions from rotation to initial asymmetries .",
