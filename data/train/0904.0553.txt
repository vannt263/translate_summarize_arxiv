    "subsequently , a number of studies @xcite identified @xmath4 gc candidates in m31 . @xcite",
    "compiled the first major m31 gc catalog , containing about 300 gc candidates and including @xmath5 photometric data .",
    "the most extensive gc surveys have since been published by @xcite , @xcite , and the bologna group @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite and @xcite provided photometric data in either @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "these surveys were mostly based on visual searches of photographic plates and are fairly complete down to @xmath7 mag ( @xmath8 mag ) @xcite , although a number of recent studies searched for fainter gcs in m31 .",
    "however , @xcite showed that a significant number of class - d and e gcs with @xmath9 are still to be confirmed ( and hence the gc luminosity function is incomplete ) , and that large surveys are needed to reach a complete sample of m31 gcs .",
    "following on from the first extensive spectroscopic survey of m31 gcs by @xcite , a significant number of authors embarked on studies of their spatial , kinematic , and metal - abundance properties . the first comprehensive catalog including photometric and spectroscopic data for m31 gcs was assembled by @xcite . the revised bologna catalog ( rbc ) of m31 gcs",
    "was recently published by @xcite and has since been revised a number of times @xcite . in the primary catalog @xcite ,",
    "all known m31 gcs and candidates were compiled based on a literature survey , leading to a total of 1164 entries including 337 confirmed gcs , 688 gc candidates , and 10 objects with undetermined classification .",
    "in addition , @xcite identified 693 known and candidate gcs in m31 using the 2mass database and included their 2mass @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "the latest rbc ( v3.5 ) was updated on march 27 , 2008 , and includes the newly discovered star clusters from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in total , 1567 gcs and gc candidates ( 509 confirmed gcs and 1058 gc candidates ) are known in m31 ; 421 former gc candidates turned out to be stars , asterisms , galaxies , hii regions , or extended clusters .",
    "in addition , the rbc v3.5 includes photometric data of m31 gcs and gc candidates in the far- and near - ultraviolet ( fuv and nuv ) from the nearby galaxies survey ( ngs ) of the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite presented a new catalog of 670 likely star clusters in the field of m31 , all with updated high - quality coordinates accurate to @xmath10 , based on images from either the local group survey @xcite or the digital sky survey .",
    "an accurate and reliable analysis of integrated stellar populations ( such as star clusters ) is key to understanding the formation and evolutionary process in galaxies . by means of comparisons of integrated populations with models of homogeneous stellar systems ,",

    "@xcite and @xcite derived age estimates for m31 gcs by fitting ssp models ( * ? ? ? * henceforth bc03 ) to their photometric measurements in a large number of intermediate- and broad - band passbands from the optical to the near - infrared ( nir ) .",

    "s312 ( b379 ) is among the first extragalactic gcs for which the age was estimated accurately using main - sequence photometry , i.e. , @xcite estimated its age at @xmath12 gyr .",

    "finally , our results and a summary are presented in ",
    "[ result.sec ] .",
    "the gc sample used in this paper was taken from the bologna catalog of @xcite , which contains 827 m31 gcs and gc candidates .",
    "in addition , our sample also supplements that of @xcite , who studied 172 gc candidates from @xcite on the basis of integrated photometric measurements in the beijing - arizona - taiwan - connecticut ( batc ) photometric system . in @xcite ,",
    "all gc candidates of classes a and b ( 353 objects ) in @xcite ( i.e. , their table iv ) were adopted as their original sample . however , of these only 223 objects are in their observed ccd fields .",
    "they also noted that b007 is a galaxy , and b055 , b132 and b147 are virtually stars @xcite .",
    "these four objects were therefore not included in @xcite s final sample . in summary , 219 class - a or b gcs were observed by @xcite , of which 47 were excluded because of missing photometric measurements in some filters . in this paper",
    "we analyze these 47 gc candidates on the basis of newly observed data in the batc photometric system combined with _ galex _ fuv / nuv photometry , broad - band @xmath13 , and nir @xmath0 ( 2mass ) data .",
    "however , we did not manage to obtain accurate photometric measurements for a number of objects because of either the dominance of a nearby very bright object ( b095 , b176 , and b202 ) , the gc candidate being very faint and superimposed on a very high background ( b119 and b324 ) , or the gc candidate being located near m32 ( b124 ) or ngc 205 ( b331 ) , both also resulting in a very high contribution .",
    "in addition , object b330 is faint and located very close to a brighter object , rendering accurate photometry impossible .",
    "thus , here we analyze the multicolor photometric properties of 39 gc candidates .",
    "figure 1 shows the spatial distributions of both our sample gcs ( circles ) and the @xcite gcs ( plus signs ) across the m31 field .      to obtain photometric measurements in the batc photometric system for the 39 gc candidates for which @xcite did not obtain photometry in a number of filters , we re -",

    "the batc photometric system uses a ford aerospace 2048@xmath142048 ccd camera with a pixel size of 15 @xmath15 m , mounted at the focus of the 0.6/0.9 m @xmath16/3 schmidt telescope at xinglong station ( national astronomical observatories of china ; naoc ) .",

    "the ccd camera is not sensitive at the shortest wavelengths covered by the batc filters .",
    "for this reason , neither @xcite nor we used the two bluest filters ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) for our observations . finding charts of the sample gcs and gc candidates in the batc @xmath21 band ( centered at 5795 ) , obtained with the naoc 60/90 cm schmidt telescope , are shown in fig .",
    "thirteen hours of imaging of the m31 field of @xcite were obtained through the usable set of 13 intermediate - band filters from november 15 , 2003 to december 13 , 2003 .",
    "bias subtraction and flat fielding using dome flats were done with the batc automatic data - reduction software , pipeline i , originally developed for the batc multicolor sky survey @xcite .",
    "the dome flat - field images were taken using a diffuser plate in front of the schmidt telescope s corrector plate .",
    "this flat - fielding technique was verified using photometry obtained for other galaxies and spectrophotometric observations .",

    "the calibrated magnitudes of these stars were then used as secondary standards to uniformly combine images from calibrated nights with their counterparts observed on non - photometric nights .",
    "table 1 lists the parameters of the batc filters and the observational statistics ; column 6 provides the scatter , in magnitudes , for the photometric observations of the four primary standard stars in each filter .      for each m31 gc candidate we used the phot routine in daophot @xcite to obtain the integrated photometry . to avoid contamination from nearby objects",
    ", we adopted an aperture of @xmath37 diameter , corresponding to 6 pixels .",
    "inner and outer radii for background determination were taken at 8 and 13 pixels from the gc center .",
    "given the small aperture used for the gc observations , aperture corrections were determined as follows .",
    "we used isolated stars to determine the magnitude difference between diameter of 6 pixels and the fully integrated magnitude of these stars in each of the 13 batc filters used .",
    "the seds for our sample of 39 gcs and gc candidates were then corrected for the filter - specific differences , and these values are given in table 2 .",
    "columns 214 give the magnitudes in the 13 batc passbands used for our observations . for each object",

    "in addition , @xcite showed that the combination of fuv and nuv photometry with optical observations in the standard broad bands enables one to efficiently break the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "@xcite showed that the age - metallicity degeneracy associated with optical broad - band colors is @xmath42 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite showed that this degeneracy can be partially broken by adding nir photometry to optical colors , which was recently confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the inclusion of an infrared ( ir ) passband can improve the predictive power of the stellar population diagnostics by @xmath43 times compared to using optical photometry alone . since nir photometry is less sensitive to interstellar extinction than the classical optical passbands , @xcite and @xcite also suggested that it provides useful complementary information that can help to disentangle the age - metallicity degeneracy ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite published _ galex _ nuv and fuv photometric data for 485 and 273 m31 gcs , respectively .",

    "updates to the original rbc were provided by @xcite who take as their photometric reference the dataset of @xcite in order to obtain the most homogeneous set of photometric measurements available .",
    "@xcite published optical and ir photometric data for 285 m31 gcs ( see their table 3 ) , obtained with the 4-shooter ccd mosaic camera and the sao ir imager on the 1.2 m telescope at the fred lawrence whipple observatory .",
    "photometric measurements in the @xmath13 bands were published by @xcite for most of our sample objects .",
    "therefore , we preferentially adopt the @xmath13 measurements of @xcite .",
    "for the remaining gcs we follow @xcite , who updated the bologna catalog with homogenised optical ( @xmath13 ) photometry collected from the most recent photometric references available .",
    "@xcite did not include the photometric uncertainties .",
    "although we refer to the original papers , the uncertainties associated with the same object but based on the use of different photometric systems are often very different .",
    "in addition , @xcite transformed their @xmath13 photometry to the reference system of @xcite by applying offsets derived from objects in common between the relevant catalog and the data set of @xcite .",
    "the measurements are therefore internally consistent , and referencing the original uncertainties may be irrelevant .",
    "therefore , we only adopted photometric uncertainties as suggested by @xcite , i.e. , 0.05 mag in @xmath44 and 0.08 mag in @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , these photometric uncertainties do not affect our results significantly , as we showed in @xcite ( see their  4.3 for details ) .",
    "@xcite identified 693 known and candidate gcs in m31 using the 2mass database , and determined their 2mass @xmath46 photometric magnitudes ( transformed to the cit photometric system ) @xcite .",
    "however , we need the original 2mass @xmath46 magnitudes for our sample gcs to compare our observational seds with the ssp models , so we reversed this transformation using the same procedures .",
    "since @xcite did not provide the 2mass @xmath0 uncertainties , we obtained these by comparing the photometric magnitudes with fig . 2 of @xcite .",

    "@xcite derived the relationships between these two systems using standard stars from the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite :    @xmath47    @xmath48    to check our photometry we derived the magnitudes in @xmath49 and @xmath50 based on eqs .",

    "very recently , @xcite determined the ages and reddening values of 140 young clusters in m31 by comparing the observed spectra with model spectra , and these clusters are less than 2 gyr old",
    ". most have ages between @xmath95 and @xmath96 yr .",
    "the ages of the m31 clusters determined in this paper are in agreement with previous determinations .",
    "many m31 gcs are resolved in _",
    "hst _ observations . some authors , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , used wfpc2 images to construct cmds for determination of the clusters metallicities , reddening values , and ages . however , these cmds are usually not deep enough to show conspicuous mstos and thus be useful for robust age determinations .",
    "in fact , only @xcite and @xcite managed to estimate the ages for four blue massive , compact star clusters and 79 candidate young star clusters by fitting isochrones to the stellar photometry .",
    "our sample contains four gcs in common with @xcite ( b006 and b045 ) , @xcite ( also b006 and b045 ) , and @xcite ( b012 and b233 ) .",
    "however , only b012 @xcite could be older than about 8 gyr ( see gallart et al .",
    "2005 ) , given the presence of a prominent blue horizontal branch , which compares rather poorly with the age obtained here ( @xmath97 gyr ) .",
    "however , even with multi - passband photometry spanning from the fuv to @xmath98 , we can only determine cluster ages in a _",
    "statistical _ sense ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this discrepancy of a few gyr highlights the difficulty of obtaining age estimates of unresolved intermediate - age clusters based on multi - passband photometry , given that the color evolution of ssps is only minimally age dependent once the population has reached an age of @xmath99 gyr .",
    "in addition , although the general age distribution of an entire cluster population ( in a given galaxy ) can be retrieved fairly self - consistently , the clusters individual age determinations depend rather strongly on the approach taken to fitting their ages ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "this , combined with a strong dependence on the adopted reddening and metallicity , results in _ individual _ age estimates of intermediate - age clusters associated with large uncertainties .",
    "cluster ages can also be derived by comparing observed with model spectra .",
    "cross - identification of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite with the sample in this paper reveals that only six gcs ( and gc candidates ) overlap with @xcite ( b006 , b012 , b045 , and b232 ) and @xcite ( b049 and b195 ) .",
    "the age deerminations of two of these ( b012 and b232 ) are inconsistent between @xcite and this paper : @xmath100 gyr and @xmath101 gyr obtained by @xcite compared to @xmath102 gyr and @xmath102 gyr , respectively , obtained in this paper .",
    "the ages of the other gcs are consistent among the different determinations .    in fact , the ages of gcs derived by different authors based on a range of methods are not always consistent .",
    "for example , the ages of b292 and b327 derived by @xcite and @xcite are @xmath103 gyr and @xmath104 gyr @xcite compared to @xmath105 gyr and @xmath106 gyr @xcite , respectively . on the other hand , @xcite estimated the age of b327 at @xmath107 gyr .",
    "in addition , the ages of clusters derived in the same paper but based on different line - index measurements are not always consistent either and may indeed differ significantly ( see the upper panels of fig . 5 in * ? ? ?",
