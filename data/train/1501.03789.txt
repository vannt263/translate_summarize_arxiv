    "photonuclear reactions along with neutron - induced fission , has been studied for several years .",
    "new reliable studies on the mass distributions of fission fragments have become necessary in order to produce neutron rich ion beams @xcite ( especially in the vicinity of @xmath2ni ) which , in turn , will open new vistas in the study of nuclei far away from the valley of stability .",
    "the use of the energetic electrons is a promising tool to get intense neutron - rich ion beams .",
    "photofission of uranium is a very powerful mechanism to produce such radioactive ion beams ( rib ) .",
    "although the photofission cross section at giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) energy for @xmath0u is about an order of magnitude lower than for the 40 mev neutron induced fission , still it is advantageous because the electrons/@xmath3-photons conversion efficiency is much more significant than that for the deuterons / neutrons . for producing neutron - rich radioactive ion beam by the photofission method , nuclei",
    "are excited by photons covering the peak of the gdr where the energetic beam of incident electrons of @xmath430 mev can be slowed down in a tungsten ( w ) converter or directly in the target ( u ) itself , generating bremsstrahlung photons @xcite which can induce fission .    in the present study ,",
    "the total photoabsorption cross section at energies covering the gdr region are calculated while the mass distributions are analyzed on the basis of the multimode - fission model @xcite and the charge distribution of photofission products are estimated .",
    "the mass distribution is interpreted as a sum of contributions of various fission modes : specifically , a symmetric mode ( sm ) and two asymmetric modes ( asmi and asmii ) associated with an enhanced yield of fission products .",
    "the average excitation energy for such a nucleus is used for the predictions of the multimode - fission model .",
    "a calculation of the contributions from various fission modes to the mass distribution of photofission fragments was performed in @xcite at two accelerator energies . without quantitative calculations ,",
    "the existence of contributions from various fission modes was highlighted in @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we perform a simultaneous analysis and a comparison of the behavior of the symmetric and asymmetric modes of photofission induced by bremsstrahlung photons in the region of excitation energies of the @xmath0u at the endpoint bremsstrahlung energy of 29.1 mev which corresponds to mean photon energy of 13.7@xmath10.3 mev @xcite that coincides with gdr peak for @xmath0u photofission .",
    "the results obtained in this way are compared with the predictions of the multimode - fission model for the dependence of individual fission modes on the excitation energy of the fissioning nucleus . the integrated yield of @xmath0u photofission and charge distribution of photofission products",
    "are calculated .",
    "the role of photofission mass yield and its charge distribution in the production of neutron - rich nuclei are explored .",
    "in the hydrodynamic theory of photonuclear reactions , the giant dipole resonance consists of lorentz line for spherical nuclei @xcite , corresponding to the absorption of photons which induce oscillations of the neutron and proton fluids in the nucleus against each other , and the superposition of two such lines for statically deformed spheroidal nuclei @xcite , corresponding to oscillations along each of the non - degenerate axes of the spheroid .",
    "the lower - energy line corresponds to oscillations along the longer axis and the higher - energy line along the shorter , since the absorption frequency decreases with increasing nuclear dimensions .",
    "therefore , the semiclassical theory of the interaction between photons and nuclei entails that the shape of a fundamental resonance in the absorption cross section is given by @xcite    @xmath5 } ^2 } \\label{seqn1 } \\vspace{-0.0cm}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the peak cross section , resonance energy and full width at half maximum , respectively .",
    "we find that like the photoabsorption cross sections , the photofission cross sections can also be described quite well by eq.(1 ) .",
    "the list of parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 extracted by fitting experimental data @xcite are provided in table - i for both photoabsorption as well as photofission cross sections .",
    "it may be observed from table - i that for photoabsorption and photofission cross sections there are little changes in parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 while @xmath6 decides the difference .",
    "therefore , we find by fitting data of all the eight actinide nuclei that ratios @xmath10 and @xmath11 for gamma absorption and subsequent fission scale as @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively with @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xcite is given by    @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the charge , mass numbers of the target nucleus implying @xmath19 depends quadratically as @xmath20 on the fissility @xmath21 . in fig.-1 ,",
    "the measured photoabsorption and photofission cross sections ( full circles ) for @xmath0u as functions of incident photon energy are compared with the predictions ( solid lines ) of the hydrodynamic theory of photonuclear reactions for the giant dipole resonance region that consists of lorentz line shapes for spherical nuclei .",
    "the dotted line represents photofission cross sections obtained by using ratio method described above .",
    "it is apparent from fig.-1 that the ratio method predictions for photofission are almost as good as the lorentz line shape fitting while the evaporation - fission process of the compound nucleus largely overestimates @xcite the photofission cross sections .    [",

    "production of neutron - rich radioactive ion beam by the photofission method is by far the most advantageous because electrons/@xmath3-photons conversion efficiency is much more significant than that for the deuterons / neutrons which matters for neutron production .",
    "nuclei are excited by photons covering the peak of the gdr where the energetic beam of incident electrons of @xmath430 mev can be slowed down in a tungsten ( w ) converter generating bremsstrahlung photons which can induce fission . in fig.-4 ,",
    "atomic number @xmath22 versus neutron number @xmath23 are plotted for exotic nuclei produced by the photofission of @xmath0u at the endpoint bremsstrahlung energy of 29.1 mev which corresponds to mean photon energy of 13.7@xmath10.3 mev .",
    "the results of three sets of calculations are presented which correspond to ( i ) nuclei with largest cross sections , that is , most probable isobars with corresponding neutron and proton numbers for the fission fragments , ( ii ) the most neutron rich isobars subject to production cross sections @xmath24100 nb and ( iii ) the most neutron rich isobars subject to production cross sections @xmath24100 fb . the experimentally observed @xmath25 stable nuclei as well as the theoretical proton and neutron drip lines are also shown in fig.-4 in order to highlight how far one can march away from the line of @xmath25-stability towards the neutron drip line by rib using @xmath0u photofission .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that at high energies @xcite the projectile fragment separator type rib facilities , being developed in different laboratories , could also provide the scope for producing many new exotic nuclei through fragmentation of high energy radioactive ion beams @xcite .",
    "in summary , we find that like the photoabsorption cross sections , the photofission cross sections can also be described quite well by lorentz line shapes .",
    "the ratio method predictions for photofission are almost as good as the lorentz line shape fitting , whereas the evaporation - fission process of the compound nucleus largely overestimates the photofission cross sections .",
    "we have performed a simultaneous analysis for the comparison of the behavior of the symmetric and asymmetric modes . the phenomenological methodology for obtaining independent and cumulative yields of isotopes produced in photofission",
    "is described . a detailed analysis of the production of each nuclear isobar via fission and the mass distributions of products originating from the photofission induced by bremsstrahlung photons ,",
    "whose endpoint energy is 29.1 mev , is provided .",
    "the endpoint energy of 29.1 mev , which is the energy of electrons that produce bremsstrahlung gammas when stopped by a @xmath26 converter , is so chosen as to correspond the mean gamma energy of 13.7@xmath10.3 mev which coincides with gdr peak for @xmath0u photofission .",
    "the production of neutron - rich ribs by the photofission method is by far the most advantageous because electrons/@xmath3-photons conversion efficiency is much more significant than that for the deuterons / neutrons .",
    "nuclei are excited by photons covering the peak of the gdr where the energetic beam of incident electrons of @xmath430 mev can be slowed down in a tungsten ( w ) converter generating bremsstrahlung photons which can induce fission .",
    "the results of three sets of calculations are presented which correspond to nuclei with largest cross sections , that is , most probable isobars with corresponding neutron and proton numbers for the fission fragments , the most neutron rich isobars subject to production cross sections greater than hundred nano barns and the most neutron rich isobars subject to production cross sections greater than hundred femto barns .",
    "how far one can march away from the line of @xmath25-stability towards the neutron drip line by rib using @xmath0u photofission is highlighted by comparison with experimentally observed @xmath25 stable nuclei as well as the theoretical proton and neutron drip lines ."
