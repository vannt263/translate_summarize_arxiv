    "gravitational deflection of massless particles close to a massive object has been extendedly studied in the case of photons and can be detected either through multiple images or by signal enhancement @xcite .",
    "here due to the extreme difficulty to detect neutrinos and the comparatively poor angular resolution of `` neutrino telescopes '' , the only thing we can hope for is a signal intensification .",
    "while stars are notorously bad lenses for photons , we will show that the situation can be very different for neutrinos : as they can cross even a stellar core , a real focusing of a neutrino beam can be achieved .",
    "in ref.@xcite , we have computed the deflection for a neutrino beam crossing an astrophysical object , as a function of the impact parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we simply give here the net deflection for a gaussian distribution cut at the object s radius @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the gaussian width , @xmath3 the object s mass ) :    @xmath4 \\frac{4m}{b}\\left(1-\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b^2}{r^2}}\\right ) + \\frac{4m}{b}\\frac{r_0/r\\,e^{r^2/r_0 ^ 2}\\sqrt\\pi/2 } { r_0/r\\,e^{r^2/r_0 ^ 2}\\sqrt\\pi/2\\,{\\rm erf}\\left(r / r_0\\right)-1}\\\\[2ex ] \\times\\left[\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b^2}{r^2}}\\,{\\rm erf}\\left(r / r_0\\right)- e^{-b^2/r_0 ^ 2}{\\rm erf}\\left(\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b^2}{r^2}}\\frac{r}{r_0}\\right ) \\right ] & { \\rm if}\\ b < r \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    a `` good lens '' requires that @xmath5 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "this is more easily discussed in terms of the effective focal length , @xmath6 .",
    "quite obviously , a perfect lens would correspond to a constant focal length , whatever the distance from the center of the object .",
    "we give in fig .",
    "[ focal ] the ( normalized ) focal lengths @xmath6 for various density profiles , namely a constant density ( typical for a planetary object ) , a gaussian distribution ( which is an easily tractable approximation of a stellar density profile ) , a lorentzian repartition ( evocative of a galactic halo ) .",
    "while neutrinos are able to travel _ across _ the massive object , we have to consider their interactions with the matter inside ; these will indeed reduce the neutrino flux and thus the efficiency of the signal amplification gained through lensing . at the energies of interest for cosmic neutrinos ( @xmath7 gev )",
    ", we have deep inelastic scattering of individual nucleons .",
    "charged currents will cause the conversion of neutrinos into charged leptons , which will later be absorbed or decay , while neutral interactions will deflect them by angles in general large compared to the lensing effect . in both cases ,",
    "the interacting neutrinos will be lost for lensing amplification .    calling @xmath8 the interaction cross - section ( which depends on the neutrino energy ) and @xmath9 the number density of scatterers along the neutrino path , the neutrino flux attenuation after passing through a layer of matter of depth @xmath10 is thus given by @xmath11    here we deal with objects having a spherical symmetry , so it is easier to express eq .",
    "( [ pro ] ) in terms of the radial variable @xmath12 , @xmath0 being the impact parameter of the neutrino with respect to the center of the object .",
    "we then get @xmath13    where @xmath1 is the radius of the object . to solve this equation",
    ", we need to collect information on the relevant cross sections , the possible mass density profiles and the composition of the object ( that is , how to relate mass density to number density ) . for the cross sections ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will suppose that the star@xcite is made upof 25% of helium and 75% of hydrogen in number ; we then get the following relations between number and mass densities : @xmath14    that we used in our numerical calculations .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ nu ] the results for neutrinos ( a similar figure is obtained for antineutrinos ) .",
    "neutrinos passing through a galaxy may interact either with its visible matter or with the surrounding halo of massive relic neutrinos .",
    "these last interactions become significant only for incoming neutrinos at ultra high energies ( of the order of @xmath15 ev ) @xcite and we may neglect them in our present frame of work .",
    "concerning the visible part of the galaxy , a rough estimate gives an average density of stars of 1 pc@xmath16 , which corresponds to a negligible probability for the neutrino to encounter a star during its passage through the galaxy , even in the worst case if it traverses the whole disk and the bulge .",
    "we thus conclude that the passage of neutrinos through the galaxy wo nt decrease their flux , and hence do not affect the lensing effect .",
    "we skip here the intricate but rather straightforward geometrical details , and jump to :",
    "we consider the sun as a first example .",
    "neutrinos passing outside the sun do nt focus close enough to earth to be of use ; in fact for them to focus on earth , we would need    @xmath17    which is clearly well inside the sun , so the out solution does not provide any sizeable effect .",
    "we consider thus neutrinos crossing the sun , using as announced a gaussian density profile for the matter distribution . as seen from fig .",
    "[ focal ] , the plot of the focal lenght never crosses the line @xmath18 a.u . which would allow for focusing on an earth - bound telescope .",
    "the smallest value is at about 22  a.u . , which means uranians can perform wonderful neutrino lensing experiments using the sun as lens , see also @xcite .",
    "for them , any source would be amplified in turn as the sun sweeps in front of it !",
    "it is easy to check that jupiter can not replace the sun as a useful lens for us , as its mass is about @xmath19 .",
    "even if we are not at the focal point , there is yet some amplification due to the improved convergence of the beam .",
    "it provides    @xmath20    the effect is significant if @xmath21 , say @xmath22 $ ] , to have a magnification higher than 2 . beyond @xmath23 ,",
    "this last effect is negligible .      for distant sources ,",
    "since the closest star is yet at about 1.3 pc , it is easy to check ( see above ) that only neutrinos passing outside the star could be focused on earth .",
    "the case is similar to photons , namely the lens only focuses neutrinos passing through a thin ring whose radius is fixed by the distance of the star .",
    "we have verified that for expected neutrino sources the enhancement is insufficient to help in detection .      for binary systems",
    "@xcite , if a compact source orbits close ( ideally at the focal distance ) from a large star , the neutrino flux passing through this star can be focused into a tight parallel beam ( in a classical lighthouse picture ) .    clearly , the result @xmath24 is achievable",
    ". this situation is really promising , providing the source is small enough compared to the lens , so that the magnification is significant .",
    "binary stars will however seldom meet all the conditions ; more exotic systems , with a compact and intense neutrino source , are needed .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have studied the lensing of both compact and galactic sources by a galaxy .",
    "we conclude that in the former case , too few events can be observed , while the second situation might be promising .",
    "with an approach based on general relativity equations we have studied with some generality neutrino lensing through different models of astrophysical objects .",
    "the main difference with photons rests in the possibility for medium energy neutrinos to cross even the stars ( despite a cut - off above a few 100  gev in that case ) .",
    "this has the important result that the quality of the lens is greatly improved , as in that case we get a nearly constant focal length in the central region of the star .",
    "this would have been very promising , had the focal length of the center of the sun happened to coincide with the radius of the earth orbit ; unfortunately this is far from being the case , and the focusing occurs closer to uranus . for what concerns the lorentzian case , we notice that the result we obtained is significantly different from the one usually quoted for photons passing through an isothermal potential .",
    "we have considered other astrophysical objects than simple stars , and various geometrical configurations , in order to identify the cases most favourable for lensing .",
    "we have taken into account the finite size of the source and of the detector and shown how they can influence the lensing characteristics .",
    "the case of a binary system seems to be quite promising , provided small and energetic sources exist ; and galaxy lenses could also provide sizeable enhancements of the signal .",
