    "one of the most striking features observed at bnl - rhic is the suppression of high @xmath1 production in central a+a collisions relative to peripheral a+a or p+a or p+p collisions .",
    "this is generally interpreted as a sign of parton energy loss in hot and dense strongly interacting matter created at the early stage of nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "this interpretation implies that the suppression should decrease towards lower energies where the initial energy and parton density is expected to be much smaller .",
    "numerous results on the energy dependence of hadron yields and spectra indicate that the onset of deconfinement is located at lower sps energies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . existing data on central and peripheral pb+pb collision at @xmath2 from the na49 experiment allow to measure the ratio @xmath6 up to about @xmath7 in transverse momentum ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a slight suppression is seen in this range , but the interpretation of this result is hindered by the poorly known interference with the cronin effect ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the nuclear modification factors @xmath3 and @xmath5 would give a clearer picture : the first one is expected to contain a certain amount of cronin effect and a possible suppression , while in the second quantity the cronin effect approximately cancels . therefore , our experiment extracted the modification factors @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 from the existing p+p ( see also @xcite ) , p+pb and pb+pb data at top ion - sps energy . the modification factor @xmath10 ( which does not contain the cronin effect to first order ) confirms our previous observations with @xmath6",
    ".    our experiment , however , has only limited statistics on p+p and p+pb collision data at top ion - sps energy .",
    "therefore , future data runs are planned .",
    "the proposed fair - cbm high luminosity experiment has also a great potential in this field , as it will be able to populate the momentum space up to the kinematic limit .",
    "for the data analysis strategy of p+p and p+pb collisions , the method developed earlier for pb+pb collisions was adopted ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this guarantees a good cancellation of the already small systematic biases .",
    "the study was performed in the rapidity interval @xmath11 ( as in pb+pb ) .",
    "the only limitation in our data analysis is our relatively poor statistics on p+p and p+pb compared to pb+pb .",
    "this also affects our particle identification procedure .",
    "however , the area conservation property of the employed poisson maximum - likelihood method ( see @xcite ) for the inclusive disentangling of the energy loss spectra allows to make a good quality @xmath12 analysis even in the low statistics range of momentum space ( see fig .",
    "[ dedx ] ) .    for completeness",
    ", we show the currently available @xmath0 statistics in p+p , p+pb and pb+pb(0 - 5% ) collisions at @xmath2 , and the lack of existing p+p reference data in the nearby energies in fig .",
    "( see also @xcite . )",
    "fig .  [ edep ] shows the energy dependence of the nuclear modification factors @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 from top ion - sps to top rhic energies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "strong increase of the modification factors @xmath3 , @xmath4 is observed at top sps energy . for @xmath5 ( here the cronin effect approximately cancels ) a slight high @xmath1 suppression",
    "is observed with binary collision scaling .",
    "when using wounded nucleon scaling , the @xmath5 shows an approximate energy - independence at low @xmath1 .",
    "both observations confirm our previous similar observations on @xmath6 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , we are not able to answer the interesting question of higher @xmath1 behavior ( above about @xmath13 ) with the currently existing p+p and p+pb data .",
    "as the current p+p and p+pb statistics limits us to @xmath14 , one of our future plans is to record more p+p and p+pb reference data in the na49-future experiment which is in preparation at the cern - sps to increase this range up to 4 gev / c . due to the limitation of this upgraded experiment and the development possibilities of the detector",
    "there is no hope in the foreseeable future to reach higher luminosity than 1000 interactions per second at cern .",
    "there is however an unique opportunity at the fair accelerator in gsi , darmstadt which will be ready around 2013 , where the planned cbm detector @xcite will be able to tolerate an interaction rate up to @xmath15 which represents an improvement by a factor of about a million relative to the available sps setup .",
    "though the proton beam energy at the fair accelerator will be limited to 90 gev this will not decrease the physics interest , because the main issues in p+p and p+a processes are even more exciting at high @xmath1 at this energy , due to the fact that there is little information on either the cronin effect or high @xmath1 suppression in this range . as seen from table [ cbmtable ] , one can profit from the increased luminosity despite the smallness of the estimated cross - sections . even with 45 gev beam energy one expects significant statistics above 4 gev / c .",

    "[ stat ] between the lines of 24 and 100 gev beam energy , the cbm experiment will study uncharted territory where the interesting change of the @xmath1 spectra from convex to concave is happening . according to the usual argument",
    "this phenomenon is regarded as a simple phase - space limitation effect , but one should be aware of the fact that at 90 gev beam energy the 3.5 gev / c transverse momentum represents only about 0.5 in @xmath45 which is still rather far away from the kinematic boundary . there may be some deeper physical effect , because the deviation from the simple exponential spectrum already starts around 1 gev / c .",
    "this was a big surprise at cern - isr in the beginning of the seventies and due to lack of systematic measurements the real cause of this effect was not elucidated since then .",
    "of course , this previously unimaginable luminosity which is expected at fair - cbm requires very special detector , data acquisition and trigger systems .",
    "the heart of the high @xmath1 filtering system is the sts sub - detector .",
    "the basic idea of the filtering algorithm is that one can define rather narrow corridors for the high @xmath1 tracks because they are almost straight . due to the relatively small number of hits in these narrow corridors",
    "one can perform extremely fast and exhaustive searches even in case of 1000-fold pileup . in order to ensure full efficiency",
    "the corresponding regions of a given silicon surface ( = mosaic ) can be used in a number of corridors , therefore a so - called `` multi - tasking mosaic - trigger network '' is proposed which is schematically shown in fig .",
