    "models estimating the fraction of surviving cells are of utmost importance for applications of ionizing radiation in radiotherapy , because both tumor control and normal tissue complication probabilities ( tcp , ntcp ) are given primarily by cell survival in the corresponding regions . in the case of hadron radiotherapy , based on irradiating by accelerated protons and light ions , the biological effects are not given by applied dose only , but depend significantly on other physical characteristics of these particles . their relative biological effectiveness ( rbe ) has been shown to vary hugely with ion kind and energy or let value ; see , e.g. , @xcite .    several phenomenological model approaches aimed at estimating the fraction of surviving cells have been proposed so far for treatment planning procedures , based e.g.  on a similarity in let characteristics between carbon and neutron beams @xcite or using the linear - quadratic ( lq ) formalism with its @xmath0 and @xmath1 coefficients depending on let and ion kind @xcite .",
    "a systematic model approach has been represented by the local effect model ( lem ) of scholz and kraft @xcite , in which the differences in biological effects of diverse ions have been related to their track structures .",
    "however , in any of these approaches the underlying physically - chemical and especially biological processes have not been addressed in detail .",
    "a realistic model scheme ( `` the probabilistic two - stage model '' ) based on probabilistic description of the main processes involved in the corresponding radiobiological mechanism will be presented in this paper .",
    "the probabilistic two - stage model is based , in principle , on distinguishing the single - particle and collective effects of the radiobiological mechanism : individual events of energy transfer , subsequent chemical reactions and also formation of dna damages occur practically independently after the impacts of individual ionizing particles , at least at dose levels and dose rates that are used commonly in radiotherapy . on the other hand , the final response of a given cell , which includes biological processes that start from dna repair and lead finally to cell survival or inactivation ,",
    "has to be classified as a response to the total effect of all traversing particles .    in the case of protons and other ions ,",
    "the amount of energy deposited in a cell nucleus by a single particle ( including all secondary particles ) is much higher than in the case of irradiating by photon or electron beams .",
    "the number of particles that contribute to a given dose level is lower , and the severity of damages formed by individual particles increases significantly . even though it is still the collective effect of all the damages that leads to cell inactivation ,",
    "the role of single - particle effects is much more important than in the case of photon irradiation .",
    "even the impact of a single particle may result in inactivating the cell ; compare e.g.  @xcite .",
    "model scheme that enables to represent the effects of single particles as well as their synergetic or saturation combinations is very helpful in such a case .    the basic idea of distinguishing the single - particle and collective effects in the case of proton and light ion irradiation has been formulated by @xcite , who also suggested that survival curves should be represented by higher - order polynomials instead of their simple parabolic description by the lq model .",
    "further analyses of the model framework have demonstrated that the polynomial expansion can be used reliably in the low - dose region only .",
    "the model has been reformulated in order to ensure its applicability to survival curves measured over a wide range of doses ; it has been also developed to greater detail  @xcite .",
    "applications of the model to analyses of experimental data have shown the possibility to describe a large variety of experimental cell survival curves . in comparison to phenomenological models , the two - stage model has enabled to represent systematically not only the global shape of cell survival curves but also their detailed structure .",
    "the importance of this feature of the model arises from the fact that even small deviations of cell survival curves from their global parabolic or linear shape might be largely amplified in the case of fractionated irradiation .",
    "within the probabilistic two - stage model of biological effects of ionizing particles , the following characteristics of the underlying radiobiological mechanism are taken into account : ( i ) the actual number of primary particles depositing energy to the cell nucleus , ( ii ) the amount of energy deposited ( including , for the sake of simplicity , the energy delivered by all secondary particles ) , and ( iii ) the resulting probability of cell inactivation which reflects the complexity of the dna damage produced .",
    "the numbers of particles traversing nuclei of individual cells of the irradiated tissue or sample are of stochastic nature .",
    "their average number , @xmath2 , is given by particle fluence @xmath3 or applied dose @xmath4 , @xmath5 here , @xmath6 denotes the proportionality constant , which reflects also geometrical characteristics of the given cell line and irradiation arrangement .",
    "the distribution of traversing particle numbers over the cell population can be described then by poisson statistics , @xmath7 here we have assumed that the impacts of individual particles can be considered as fully random , and that the diameters of the most efficient track parts are by far smaller than the size of cell nucleus , which is in agreement with the results of track structure studies @xcite .      the amount of energy transferred to cell nucleus ( or , more specifically , to chromosomal system and sensitive regions within it ) together with the spatial distribution of individual energy transfer events play key roles with respect to the complexity of the resulting dna damage .",
    "this is in turn crucial for the future fate of the given cell .",
    "the amount of energy transferred to chromosomal system by each primary particle ( including all its secondaries ) is a stochastic quantity .",
    "it is influenced by energy and energy - loss spectra of beam particles .",
    "it may be , in principle , estimated on the basis of theoretical predictions , monte carlo calculations or microdosimetry measurements .",
    "let us denote by @xmath8 the spectrum of energy @xmath9 deposited to cell chromosomal system in one event ( one traversal , i.e.  one primary particle plus all its secondaries ) .",
    "the normalization condition reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the maximum energy that may be transferred in one event .",
    "the spectrum of energy transferred in @xmath12 events is given , then , by a corresponding convolution @xmath13 ( \\varepsilon )         = \\int_0^{\\varepsilon_{max } } \\mathrm{d } \\varepsilon ' \\ \\pi_1(\\varepsilon ' )          \\ \\pi_{k-1}(\\varepsilon-\\varepsilon ' ) \\ , \\ ] ] which fulfils the condition @xmath14 .",
    "the average energy deposited per cell nucleus ( or chromosomal system ) , which is obtained by weighting correspondingly the average energy deposited by a given number of particles , @xmath15 is proportional to the applied dose @xmath4 ( or to particle fluence @xmath3 ) .",
    "the number of events ( traversals of primary particles ) , @xmath12 , and the total amount of transferred energy , @xmath9 , stand for the primary characteristics describing processes of the physical phase of the radiobiological mechanism .",
    "the subsequent chemical and biological processes include large cascades of chemical reactions that lead to the formation of dna damage , dna repair processes , and further processes of the biological response of the cell that result finally either in its survival or inactivation .",
    "as far as cell survival is concerned , these complex processes can be taken into account in a simplified way by representing the final endpoints directly , i.e.  by considering only the final probabilities of cell inactivation . in the following",
    "we shall denote by @xmath16 the average cell inactivation probability after the impact of @xmath12 ( primary ) particles that have deposited energy @xmath9 .",
    "note that a similar approach , based e.g.  on dsb - induction probabilities , might be used if other effects , e.g.  the yields of dna damage , were the endpoints of interest .",
    "probability of cell survival ( i.e. , cell survival curve ) is , then , given by @xmath17 where the distribution of the actual number of particle traversals , @xmath12 , and also the spectra of transferred energy , @xmath18 , have been taken into account . here",
    "the dose dependence is included in @xmath19 , see eq .",
    "( [ wds-2 ] ) .",
    "note that the average number of traversing particles per unit dose , @xmath6 , as well as transferred energy spectra , @xmath18 , and also inactivation probabilities @xmath16 vary significantly for different particles , their let values and/or diverse cell lines .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental evidence of the dependence of cell survival on all these factors . given the inactivation probabilities @xmath16 together with the distribution of particle numbers @xmath20 and the spectra of transferred energy @xmath18 under the given experimental or clinical irradiation conditions , one would be able to calculate the cell survival probability according to eq .",
    "( [ wds-4 ] ) . using corresponding model approaches @xcite , macroscopic endpoints such as the tumor control and normal tissue complication probabilities ( tcp and ntcp ) can be estimated , then . in evaluating the cell survival probability according to eq .",
    "( [ wds-4 ] ) , a crucial role is played by the inactivation probabilities @xmath21 .",
    "these probabilities reflect the biological effectiveness of different radiation modalities . they may be interpreted directly in terms of physical and biological processes .",
    "they represent , therefore , a solid basis for establishing more detailed microscopic models of radiobiological mechanism",
    ". methods of evaluating these probabilities on the basis of analyzing corresponding experimental cell - survival data will be derived and discussed in the next sections .",
    "radiobiological experiments aimed at establishing the biological effectiveness of different radiation kinds are performed usually by irradiating cell monolayers by monoenergetic beams only .",
    "the beam energy is chosen so as to correspond to certain regions in the bragg peak of the given particles ( so - called track - segment experiments ) .",
    "in such a case the spectrum of transferred energy is rather narrow , at least as compared to non - monoenergetic beams .",
    "the ( average ) energy transferred to cell nuclei is proportional to the let value @xmath22 of the particles .",
    "moreover , in this case the average number of ( primary ) particles traversing cell nuclei , i.e.  the parameter @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "( [ kav ] ) and  ( [ wds-2 ] ) ) , can be related to the effective cross - section , @xmath23 , of the cell nucleus ( or chromosomal system ) and let value @xmath22 by @xmath24 approximating the density of traversed medium by that of water , the conversion constant @xmath25 for the usual choice of units ( @xmath26}$ ] , @xmath27}$ ] , @xmath28}$ ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath23 denotes the geometrical effective cross - section of the chromosomal system ( or of sensitive region within cell nucleus ) to be traversed by the given particles .",
    "the consequent processes of dna damage and cellular response are not involved in @xmath23 , but treated separately .",
    "note especially that @xmath23 is not identical to cell inactivation cross - section , which is used by some authors to describe ( the linear component of ) the probability , per 1 particle , of the cell to be inactivated ; compare e.g.  @xcite .",
    "cell survival probability can be , then , expressed as @xmath29 where ( average ) inactivation probabilities @xmath30 are now expressed as functions of let value @xmath22 instead of energy @xmath9 ; they are given by @xmath31 .",
    "in the case of particles characterized by higher let values , i.e.  protons , neutrons and ions , even the impact of a single primary particle ( including the effects of all its secondary particles ) may produce a severe damage to chromosomal dna , which might finally lead to cell inactivation . in the following , we shall refer to these damages as to `` single - particle induced '' damages .",
    "let us denote the probability of their induction , per one traversing particle , by @xmath32 .",
    "if @xmath12 particles have traversed the chromosomal system , the probability of not being damaged in this way is given by @xmath33    a vast majority of dna damages formed by traversing particles are not of this severity ; they can be repaired successfully and do not lead to cell inactivation .",
    "however , dna damages caused by different particles might combine to form a kind of damage that is difficult to be repaired .",
    "synergetic combinations of such damages might include combinations of single - strand breaks ( ssbs ) into a double - strand break ( dsb ) or dsbs into a more complex damage .",
    "they need not be limited to one chromosome only ; e.g.  the impact of a particle pair damaging corresponding segments of chromosomes of a given homologous pair . to account for these combined effects ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath34 the average probability that such a severe damage , which alone does not result in inactivating the cell , has been formed by a single particle .",
    "if this is the only damage to the cell , we shall assume that it can be repaired quite easily and the cell will survive , possibly with some delay in its proliferation cycle .",
    "however , combination of two or more such damages might lead to cell inactivation if not repaired correctly .",
    "probability that no such `` pair '' or `` combined '' damage has been formed after the impact of @xmath12 particles is then , to the first approximation , given by @xmath35 here we have assumed , for the sake of simplicity , that the synergetic effects occur predominantly from particle pairs only ; the exponent in the last formula stands just for the number of particle pairs .    the final biological effect , measured e.g.  by means of cell survival , does not depend only on the initial yield of dna damages .",
    "cellular repair processes have been shown to contribute significantly to this point , too . in the following",
    "we shall assume that severe dna damages potentially leading to cell inactivation , either caused by single particles ( `` single - particle induced '' damages ) or combined from multi - particle effects ( `` combined '' or `` pair '' damages ) , may be repaired by the cell .",
    "we shall denote the probabilities of repairing them successfully by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "after the cellular repair processes took place , the probability that a residual severe damage is present equals , then , @xmath38 in the case of single - particle induced damages , and @xmath39 in the case of combined ( or `` pair '' ) damages , respectively .",
    "here we have explicitly indicated that the rate and fidelity of repair processes in the two cases need not be equal .",
    "the damage complexity increases with the number of traversing particles @xmath12 and with the let value @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the probability of successful repair of dna damages should decrease with these factors .",
    "the repair probability might , however , in some cases exhibit more complex behavior , corresponding to the onset of cellular repair processes .    the probabilities that the mentioned damages have either not been formed at all or",
    "have been repaired faithfully are just the complements of the last terms , @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "if the cell should survive , it must not be inactivated by either of the mentioned mechanisms ; i.e. , neither single - particle induced nor pair damages must be present after the repair processes took place .",
    "the cell survival probability is , therefore , given by @xmath42 and the inactivation probability @xmath43    the cell survival probability @xmath44 after applied dose @xmath4 is given then by eq .",
    "( [ wds-6 ] ) , where the distribution of the numbers of particles traversing individual cell nuclei is given by poisson distribution , eq .",
    "( [ wds-2 ] ) . in the case of bragg peak or other non - monoenergetic irradiation ,",
    "the spectra of transferred energy have to be taken into account , too , according to eq .",
    "( [ wds-4 ] ) .",
    "similarly , in the case of mixed beam irradiation one has to convolve these results with the spectrum of traversing particles ( i.e.  with the abundances of individual ion species in the beam ) , again in the way analogous to that indicated in eq .",
    "( [ wds-4 ] ) .",
    "the probabilities of `` single - particle '' and `` pair '' damage formation , @xmath32 and @xmath34 , as well as of successful repair , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , depend significantly on the radiation quality ( ion kind and let value ) and , of course , on the biological characteristics of given cell line ( cellular radiosensitivity , cell cycle phase etc . ) .",
    "the values of these parameters may be established by analyzing corresponding experimental data .",
    "systematic sets of data , in which cell survival has been assessed for a given ion at different energies ( different let values ) , might be used to evaluate even the functional dependence of these probabilities on particles let values .",
    "corresponding analyses have been performed by us for various ions ; the results will be shown in the following sections . in determining the values of the damage induction and repair probabilities , more detailed microscopic models , representing the underlying chemical and biological processes ,",
    "might be helpful , too .",
    "in fact , the given model scheme represents a framework enabling one to relate the outputs of those microscopic models to cell survival characteristics , which might be assessed experimentally in a direct way",
    ".    the probability of successful repair , @xmath47 , should reflect the complexity of the total damage formed by all the traversing particles .",
    "the damage complexity might be , to the first approximation , estimated from the total amount of energy deposited to cell nucleus ( or chromosomal system ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we have therefore limited ourselves to consider the repair probability , @xmath48 , to be a function of the transferred energy only , @xmath49 : @xmath50      let us discuss the basic features of the given model framework , especially the role of individual model parameters in determining the shapes of cell survival curves . obviously , there are no difficulties in describing simple linear or parabolic cell survival curves by the given model scheme .",
    "linear curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linear ] ) can be represented by taking into account the terms including @xmath51 only , i.e.  by assuming that all the lesions formed by the traversing particles are lethal , do not need to be combined with damages caused by other particles ( i.e.  @xmath52 ) , and can not be repaired by the cell ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental evidence : linear survival curves have been found especially in very sensitive cell lines and in cell lines that have been proved to be deficient in repair  @xcite .",
    "linear response has been observed also in irradiating by very high - let particles , where the severity of dna damages is assumed to be very high  @xcite .",
    "similarly , survival curves characterized by a global parabolic shape can be represented by taking into account the terms including @xmath54 ; compare fig .",
    "[ fig : parabolic ] . even cell lines exhibiting dna repair of a certain level may be characterized by roughly parabolic survival curves ; compare fig .",
    "[ fig : parabolic+repair ] .    ' '' ''    cell survival curves may , however , exhibit more complex behavior .",
    "the given model scheme can be used to represent survival curves showing , e.g. , a downward bending in the region of lower doses followed by an upward bending at higher doses , compare fig .",
    "[ fig : complex_shape ] .",
    "the corresponding repair probability , to which such complex behavior has to be attributed , is shown , too .    ' '' ''    the model enables one to describe also survival curves exhibiting the low - dose hypersensitivity phenomenon , which has been observed for many cell lines irradiated by different particles  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hypersensitivity ] two examples of calculated survival curves with hypersensitivity regions are demonstrated .",
    "the corresponding repair characteristics , showing an onset ( triggering ) effect , are displayed , too .",
    "note that if the repair profile exhibits significant variations in the rather narrow range of a few particles traversing the nucleus , the corresponding survival curve may be characterized even by a temporary increase in the medium - dose region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hypersensitivity - temporary_increase ] ) .",
    "such behavior has been found in several experiments , compare e.g.  @xcite .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    the examples shown in this section demonstrate clearly that in determining the shape of cell survival curves the repair characteristics may be even more important than the damage induction itself .",
    "the proposed model has been applied to analysis of experimental cell survival data for chinese hamster v79 cells after irradiation by low - energy protons , which was assessed experimentally by @xcite .",

    "single - particle induced damages , @xmath32 , have turned out to play a minor role only .",
