    "adiabatic elimination is a standard modeling procedure adopted when dealing with systems that have both slow and fast variables .",
    "here one considers the limit in which the fast variables are effectively relaxed to instantaneous equilibrium values , which may in turn depend on external influences , and an effective dynamics may therefore be deduced for the slow variables .",
    "the problem becomes more involved when the system is driven by stochastic influences . in quantum optics , fast oscillators driven by quantum input processes",
    "may be eliminated from the dynamics using the limiting procedure that they are strongly coupled to the input field processes .",
    "the first rigorous account of this limit was given by gough and van handel@xcite and the resulting reduced open dynamics for the slow degrees of freedom were obtained .",

    "we may model the network as a global markovian system @xcite . for a certain class of quantum networks and under certain conditions ,",
    "we show that the instantaneous feedback limit used to obtain a markovian quantum feedback network is indeed compatible with the component - wise adiabatic elimination procedure .",
    "this is the ideal situation one would require for modeling purposes , however , the conclusion is not immediately obvious when treating individual cases , particularly when the architecture of the network becomes complex . we show that for both limits the form of the coefficients of the quantum stochastic differential equation ( qsde ) describing the limit evolution can be formulated as a schur complement of pre - limit coefficients .",
    "commutativity of the schur complementation procedure then ensures the commutativity of the adiabatic elimination and instantaneous feedback limits .",
    "in section [ sec : qo - models ] we shall review the rigorous results that exist for adiabatic elimination of oscillator components and adapt the results to deal with multiple oscillator elimination ( the proof is deferred to the appendix ) .",
    "we show commutativity of the limits for a simple cascade of components and for components in a non - trivial feedback loop . in section [ sec : ae - qfn ] , we present the main features of schur complementation which we shall need , and show that both limits involve schur complementation procedures .",

    "now we show that @xmath271 exists .",
    "we require @xmath449 let @xmath450 be @xmath451 \\left[\\begin{array}{c }                                m_{b , a}x\\\\                    m_{c , a}x                               \\end{array}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some vector @xmath452 . using ( [ eq : condition2 ] ) and noting that @xmath453 ( due to ( [ eq : condition3 ] ) and lemma [ lm : rl - inverse ] ) leads to @xmath454 \\left[\\begin{array}{c }      m_{b , b}y + m_{b , c}z\\\\      m_{c , b}y + m_{c , c}z        \\end{array}\\right]\\\\    & = & ( m_{b , b } - m_{b , c } m_{c , c}^- m_{c , b})x\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows the required image space inclusion .    to show that @xmath455 holds we choose some @xmath456 and see that @xmath457 \\left[\\begin{array}{c }      x\\\\      -m_{c , c}^- m_{c , b}x \\end{array}\\right ] = 0\\ ] ] which implies that @xmath458 \\in   \\ker [ \\begin{array}{cc } m_{b , b } & m_{b , c } \\end{array}]$ ] . however , @xmath459 since @xmath460 ( by ( [ eq:4 ] ) and lemma [ lm : rl - inverse ] ) .",

    "the model may initially be described by the set of coefficients @xmath307 over the space @xmath463 and we decompose this as @xmath464 where @xmath465 with respect to this decomposition , we decompose @xmath307 into sub - blocks as @xmath466 \\equiv \\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc } r_1 & m_1 & x_1 & 0\\\\ g_1 & s_{\\rm ii } -i & c_{\\rm i }   & 0\\\\ z_1 & -c^*s_{\\rm i } & a & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0     \\end{array}\\right ] , \\label{eqn : g decomp}\\ ] ] the set of labels @xmath467 can be split up into the slow labels @xmath468 and the fast labels @xmath469 as well as the external labels @xmath470 and the internal labels @xmath471 .    to proceed , we must first establish that the generalized schur complement is well - defined .",
    "here we are ultimately retaining the `` slow external '' degrees of freedom ( index 1 ) and eliminating the index sets @xmath472 .",
    "to this end , we need to check that conditions ( [ eq : condition1])-([eq : condition6 ] ) are all satisfied .",

    "then @xmath475 satisfies @xmath476 and @xmath477 , while @xmath478 is arbitrary .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath479 and @xmath480 . since @xmath332 is invertible by hypothesis",
    ", we find that @xmath481 .",
    "it then follows that also @xmath482 , and we conclude that @xmath483 $ ] consists of vectors of the form @xmath484 . clearly such vectors lie in the kernel of @xmath485 $ ] and we conclude that @xmath474 \\subseteq { \\rm ker}[\\begin{array}{ccc } m_1 & x_1 & 0 \\end{array}]$ ] .",
    "next , we check if for every given vector @xmath452 there exist vectors @xmath486 and @xmath478 such that we have the equality @xmath487=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } s_{\\rm ii}-i & c_{\\rm i }   \\\\ -c^*s_{\\rm i } & a   \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } y \\\\   z \\end{array}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : aux - im - incl}\\ ] ] in particular , this will be satisfied if the matrix @xmath488 $ ] is invertible .",
    "however , since @xmath489 and @xmath125 are invertible we see that this simply follows from the banachiewicz formula . therefore , for any vector @xmath452 there indeed exist vectors @xmath486 and @xmath478 such that ( [ eq : aux - im - incl ] ) holds and we conclude that @xmath490 \\subseteq { \\rm im}\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } s_{\\rm ii } & c_{\\rm i }   & 0 \\\\ -c^*s_{\\rm i } & a   & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right]$ ]",
    ". moreover , from the fact that @xmath125 is invertible we also get @xmath491 & \\subseteq & { \\rm ker}\\,[\\begin{array}{cc } c_{\\rm i } & 0 \\end{array}],\\\\ { \\rm im}\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } -c^*s_{\\rm i } \\\\ 0 \\end{array}\\right ] & \\subseteq & { \\rm im}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } a   & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while from the invertibility of @xmath333 we automatically have @xmath492,\\\\ { \\rm im}\\,[\\begin{array}{cc } c_{\\rm i } & 0 \\end{array } ] & \\subseteq & { \\rm im}(s_{\\rm ii}-i).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore conditions ( [ eq : condition1])-([eq : condition6 ] ) are satisfied , and the theorem now follows from lemmata [ new ] and [ lem : scrule ] .",
