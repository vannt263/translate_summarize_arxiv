    "we view the sine - gordon model as a perturbation of the liouville cft .",
    "the latter is given by the action without the last term , and the central charge is @xmath5 the exponential field parametrised as @xmath6 turns in the cft limit into a primary field with the scaling dimension @xmath7 abusing the language , we refer to as a primary field in the sine - gordon model as well .",
    "in @xcite , we have considered two types of fermions .",
    "one of them , denoted @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are local in nature . acting on a primary field ,",
    "together with the action of local integrals of motion , they create the space of all descendant fields , which in the cft limit corresponds to the verma module .",
    "the other type , denoted @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are non - local .",
    "we call them the first fermionic screening operators .",
    "they relate primary fields with shifted exponents , @xmath12 as well as their corresponding descendants . for a more precise statement , see section [ sec : cftdes ] below . these are analogous to one of the two screening operators which exist in liouville cft .",
    "for these primary fields and fermionic descendants , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) can be written explicitly .",
    "this is the main advantage of the fermionic description of the space of local fields .    as is well known , in cft there exist another set of screening operators due to the symmetry @xmath13 the goal of this paper is to introduce their fermionic counterpart .",
    "we shall call them the second fermionic screeing operators and denote them by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the text is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we consider the case of cft on a cylinder . in @xcite , fermions are introduced by specifying their three point functions , which are encoded in a ` structure function ' called @xmath16 . in section 2.1",
    "we re - examine the analytic structure of @xmath16 and find its asymptotic behavior in sectorial domains . in section 2.2",
    "we define the operators @xmath17 , etc .",
    ", from the asymptotic expansion of @xmath16 .",
    "they relate the primary fields @xmath18 we formulate the conjectural formulas pertaining to primary fields , and in section 2.3 for their descendants . in section 2.4",
    "we verify various consistency relations required from the conjectures . in section 2.5",
    "we glue togehter the two chiralities and check their three point functions against the zamolodchikov - zamolodchikov formula .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the case of the sine - gordon model . following the method in cft we introduce the second fermionic screening operators by giving formulas for the vev . in section 3.2",
    "we check the formula with the lukyanov - zamolodchikov formula for one - point functions in the sine - gordon model on the infinite plane . in section 3.3",
    "we verify the validity of the consistency relations for them .",
    "in this section we explain how to introduce the second fermionic screening operators in cft .      in @xcite we considered chiral cft on a cylinder @xmath20 , with the central charge , and primary fields @xmath21 of scaling dimension .",
    "the objects of interest are the fermionic operators acting on the space of descendants of @xmath22 .",
    "they are defined through the `` structure function '' @xmath23 .",
    "it describes the three point functions of the fermioninc descendants of @xmath22 , in the presence of primary fields @xmath24 , @xmath25 inserted at @xmath26 . in this subsection",
    ", we re - examine the analytic structure of @xmath16 in order to extract the fermionic screening operators .",
    "so far the asymptotic analysis has been carried out only in the case @xmath27 .",
    "throught this text we shall make this assumption .",
    "it is convenient to slightly modify @xmath16 in @xcite , ( 11.5 ) , and start from the function @xmath28 here we have set @xmath29 and @xmath30 the function @xmath31 is essentially the mellin transform of the resolvent kernel of a linear integral operator associated with the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equation .",
    "it has an asymptotic expansion in @xmath32 @xmath33 the coefficients @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) are polynomials in @xmath36 determined from the recursion relation in @xcite , section 11 .",
    "we remark that , when the fields @xmath37 are changed to descendants , the same structure for @xmath38 still persists , the only change being in @xmath31 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    since @xmath39",
    "the integral converges term by term in @xmath32 , provided @xmath40 belong to the domain @xmath41 by moving the contours into the lower half plane and taking residues in @xmath36 , one obtains an asymptotic expansion of the form @xmath42 it is easy to see that the series in the right hand side is actually convergent on @xmath43 , where @xmath44 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    ".5 cm        _ fig.1 : domains of analyticity of @xmath38 .",
    "this function is holomorphic in the unit disk @xmath45 , and is continued analytically to the complex plane with the two cuts @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) being removed .",
    "_ .5 cm    in fact , @xmath38 can be continued analytically in each variable to the entire complex plane with the two cuts @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) being removed .",
    "the analytic continuation in the variable @xmath49 is achieved explicitly by a similar integral , wherein the function @xmath50 is changed to @xmath51 with @xmath52 to see this , notice that the series expansion remains intact under this modification because @xmath53 on the other hand , due to the behavior @xmath54 the domain of convergence of the integral is changed from @xmath55 to @xmath56    of course the same procedure applies to the @xmath57 variable as well .",
    "altogether one obatins 4 different expressions of the same function @xmath58 corresponding to the sectors @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "let us write @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 the function @xmath64 coincides with @xmath19 considered originally in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath65 , the modified function @xmath66 has an asymptotic expansion in each sector .",
    "for instance , one has the expansions of the form @xmath67 in @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the same quantity @xmath70 appears in two places .",
    "note that @xmath71 is independent of @xmath72 .",
    "later on , in section 3.1 , we shall use their asymptotic expansions as @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 the asymptotic expansions as @xmath76 are obtained from the equality @xmath77      the function @xmath78 has three series of poles and zeroes in @xmath79 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 . in @xcite ,",
    "the first is used to introduce the fermionic creation operators @xmath82 while the second is used for the screening operators @xmath83 they are related to the three point functions as follows .",
    "@xmath84 here and after we use the abbreviation @xmath85 and so on",
    ". we shall refer to them as ` pairings ' of fermions .",
    "the analysis in the previous subsection motivates us to introduce yet another fermions @xmath86 such that together with @xmath87 and @xmath88 they satisfy @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "the operators @xmath91 correspond to the poles of @xmath92 which are not canceled by the zeros in .",
    "we assign the following degrees to the fourier components : @xmath93 their pairings are given explicitly as follows .",
    "set @xmath94 then we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 we have given only those pairings which will be relevant to our calculations .",
    "we remark that the fermionic operators for the anti - chiral cft are introduced by working with the function @xmath97 where @xmath98 , as a counterpart for @xmath99 .",
    "we have the following ( conjectural ) symmetry for the coefficients in the asymptotic expansions : @xmath100 this implies the symmetry between the first and the second chiralities : the roles of @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath17 are interchanged with @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , and vice versa for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the expansions at @xmath108 and @xmath109 are interchanged : @xmath110 however , since the relations between @xmath111 and @xmath40 are reversed in power , in terms of the integration variables @xmath36 in , there is no interchange between the upper and lower half planes wherein we take residues .",
    "the domain of convergence for the integral representation of the function @xmath112 is given by .",
    "it will change for @xmath113 because of the change @xmath114 in the integrand .",
    "however , by the same reason as above , the domain of convergence in the variable @xmath115 is unchanged .",
    "there is a sign change in the residues caused by the change .",
    "this will bring the pairings @xmath116 the modification of the kernel function in the integral for the second screening operator in the anti - chiral case is @xmath117 where @xmath118 this will bring @xmath119      let us formulate our conjectures relating various primary fields with shifted exponents and their fermionic descendants .",
    "we follow the multi - index notation in @xcite and write , for @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , @xmath122 arranging @xmath123 s from left to right and @xmath106 s in the opposite order .",
    "we also set @xmath124 and write @xmath125 to mean the set @xmath126 .",
    "for the first screening operators the conjectures in @xcite state as follows .",
    "let @xmath127 be an non - negative integer , and let @xmath128 be multi - indices such that @xmath129 .",
    "then @xmath130 here the sign @xmath131 means both sides have the same three point functions , e.g. , latexmath:[\\ ] ] in this notation , we have @xmath198 on the other hand , the left hand side of the consistency relation reads @xmath199",
    "@xmath200 @xmath201 @xmath202 where @xmath203 . the formula for the normalization factor @xmath148",
    "is obtained from these relations .",
    "the relations for the normalization factor are the same for the anti - chiral case .",
    "this follows from the formulas for the fermionic pairings that are given in section 2.2 .",
    "the primary field in the full cft is @xmath204 with some numerical coefficient @xmath205 .",
    "introduce the screened primary field by @xmath206 gluing toghether the relation with their anti - chiral partners , one finds that @xmath207 where the normalisation coefficient @xmath208 is related to @xmath148 in and its anti - chiral counterpart @xmath209 via @xmath210 the recursive relations , which determine the general case out of @xmath211 , are @xmath212 these relations are deduced from the corresponding ones for @xmath213 and the simple relations @xmath214    choosing the ` exponential normalisation ' @xmath215 , one can determine @xmath208 by comparing with the liouville three point functions by zamolodchikov - zamolodchikov @xcite .",
    "this calculation for the coefficient @xmath216 is explained in @xcite , eq.(6.8 ) . for @xmath217 ,",
    "the relevant formula can be obtained by the substitution @xmath218 in @xcite , ( a.2 ) ( which amounts to @xmath219 ) , and comparing the result with the pairing @xmath220 given by .",
    "we have checked that the @xmath72-dependent part agrees up to the degree @xmath176 .",
    "collecting the coefficients , we obtain the following result .",
    "@xmath221 and @xmath222 the third one can be obtained from the first two by the relation @xmath223",
    "in this section , we discuss the sine - gordon model . since the working is entirely similar to the one of @xcite , we shall be rather brief , indicating only the necessary formulas .",
    "as in the cft case , the fermions in the sine - gordon model are defined by giving the expectation values of basic descendants .",
    "the way of introducing the second screening operators is similar to that in cft : in place of the function @xmath224 given in @xcite , eq .",
    "( 7.8 ) , we use the following formal integral @xmath225 which we understand as the expansions in @xmath226 at @xmath227 ; the expansions are obtained by taking residues in @xmath36 in the upper / lower half planes .",
    "accordingly , we define @xmath228 for @xmath229 , and @xmath230 for @xmath231 as follows : @xmath232 the prescription for the fermion pairings is as follows .",
    "@xmath233 it is immediate to write them in terms of the fourier components . for that purpose",
    "let us introduce the shorthand notation @xmath234",
    "@xmath235 @xmath236 the minus sign in front of @xmath237 comes from the orientation of cycles for complex integration .    for all @xmath238 and @xmath239",
    "we have @xmath240 @xmath241 @xmath242 the first screening operators decouple from the rest : @xmath243 it is not surprising that the symmetry between two kinds of screening operators is broken : the sg model is a perturbation of cft by the operators which behaves differently with respect to them .",
    "the screened primary field is defined by the same formula as before .",
    "notice that it is normalized as @xmath247 in @xcite , we have verified for @xmath248 that this formula agrees with the lukyanov - zamolodchikov formula @xcite for the one - point function on the plane .",
    "let us check that it works also for the second screening operators , i.e. , for @xmath249 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , section 9 , the following identities can be derived from the linear integral equation defining @xmath252 . @xmath253",
    "combining them together and manipulating with determinants , one deduces further that for all @xmath254 @xmath255 where @xmath256 and the indices range over @xmath257        research of mj is supported by the grant - in - aid for scientific research b-20340027 .",
