    "the reaction @xmath5 at the proton energy @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) has the cross section about @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "then for the luminosity of wasa at celsius about @xmath9  @xcite @xmath10 @xmath11- mesons will be produced every second .",
    "this means that the reaction @xmath2 with the expected branching ratio @xmath12 + and the asymmetries in the reactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the expected level @xmath13 @xmath14 will become accessible for investigations after a year of running ( approximately @xmath15 @xmath16 s ) .    taking into account the expected level of the effects there should be the strong restrictions on the background processes . in this note",
    "we are considering the background decays of @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons that can be produced in the @xmath17 -collisions at @xmath6 under the threshold .",
    "the relevant parameters of @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons decays are the following  @xcite    @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21    in the next section we will evaluate the cross sections of @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons production and the corresponding background in the considered decay channels of @xmath16- meson .",
    "we will evaluate the cross sections of @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons production in the region of invariant masses ( @xmath22 ) near the mass of @xmath16- meson ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we will describe the production of @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons by the diagrams fig.1 where the vertecies of @xmath17- interaction and vector meson emission are considered as constants , i.e. independent on the energy of the incident proton ( @xmath24 ) and the invariant mass of emitted meson ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "then the production cross section is defined by the accessible phase space factors , the resonance form of @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons propagators and the @xmath25- dependence of @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons decay widths .",
    "let us therefore write the differential production cross section in the following form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the production cross section of a particle with invariant mass @xmath22 that depends on @xmath24 and @xmath25 only due to accessible phase space ( approximation ) , + @xmath28 is the @xmath25- dependent width of the resonance .    in oder to get the desireable cross sections of @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons production the differential cross section ( [ dcs ] ) should be integrated over @xmath25 in the region @xmath29 .",
    "the unknown constant in @xmath27 can be found using experimental data on @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons production at energies @xmath24 above the threshold ( see later ) .",
    "let us now describe the @xmath25- dependence of @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons decay widths @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath0- meson we will take into account the two particle phase space ( @xmath30 is the main decay channel of @xmath0- meson ) and the @xmath31-wave character of @xmath30 decay @xmath32    for @xmath1- meson the main decay channel is @xmath33 .",
    "the decay width can be calculated numerically using the following form of matrix element ( uniquely determined ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the polarization vector of @xmath1- meson and @xmath36 are the momenta of pions .",
    "the @xmath0- meson production cross section is known at @xmath37  @xcite and is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "recalculating it at the @xmath39 and @xmath29 we get @xmath40 the @xmath1- meson production cross section is known at @xmath41  @xcite and is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "recalculating it at the @xmath39 and @xmath29 we get @xmath42    using the calculated cross sections and the branching ratios of @xmath0- and @xmath1- decays mentioned in the introduction we get @xmath0- and @xmath1- backgrounds for @xmath43 decay @xmath44 @xmath45 and the following background in the asymmetries @xcite of @xmath3 and @xmath4- decays @xmath46 @xmath47 + here @xmath48 is equal to @xmath49 .",
    "the asymmetries in both cases are due to the charged pions in the background amplitudes have the opposite symmetry under the intergange of momenta comparing to the chaged pions from the @xmath16- decays amplitudes and the amplitudes of the process and of the background interfere .",
    "so , we have considered the problem of @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons contributions to the background for @xmath2 decay and to the asymmetries in the decays @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we have found that the background due to @xmath0- and @xmath1- mesons is comparable with the expected signal from @xmath16- meson decay . for the case of @xmath2 decay the background can be lowered by lowering @xmath48 ( better energy resolution ) or by selecting the events with the invariant mass of @xmath50- pair in the region where the decays of vector mesons do not substantially contribute . in the case of asymmetries",
    "the first way ( lowering of @xmath48 ) will not change the situation because of the effect ( interference with the background ) does not depend on @xmath48 .",
    "so , in this case there should be looked for the regions on the dalitz plot where the ratio of the signal to background is higher .",
