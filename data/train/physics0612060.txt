    "in nature , there exist various systems that involve chemical reactions .",
    "some systems are on a geographical scale while others are on a nanoscale , in particular , the biochemical reactions in a cell . to study the dynamics of reaction systems , we often adopt rate equations in order to observe the change in the chemical concentrations . in rate equations , we consider the concentrations to be continuous variables and the rate of each reaction as a function of the concentrations .",
    "in fact , in macroscopic systems , there are a large number of molecules ; therefore , continuous representations are usually applicable",
    ".    when the concentration of a certain chemical is low , fluctuations in the reactions or flows can not be negligible .",
    "they are usually treated by employing stochastic differential equations , in which the noise is used as a continuum description of the fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the employment of stochastic differential equations has led to some important discoveries such as noise - induced transitions @xcite , noise - induced order @xcite , and stochastic resonance @xcite .    in stochastic differential equations , the quantities of chemicals",
    "are still regarded as continuous variables . at a microscopic level , however , we need to seriously consider the fact that the number of molecules is an integer ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) that changes in a discrete manner .",
    "fluctuations originate from the discrete stochastic changes ; thus , continuum descriptions of fluctuations are not always appropriate .",
    "biological cells appear to provide a good example for such discreteness in molecule numbers .",
    "the size of the cells is of the order of microns , in which nanoscale `` quantum '' effects can be ignored .",
    "however , in these cells , some chemicals act at extremely low concentrations of the order of pm or nm . assuming that the typical volume of a cell ranges from @xmath1 to @xmath4 @xmath5 , the concentration of one molecule in the cell volume corresponds to @xmath6 pm to @xmath6 nm .",
    "it is possible that the molecule numbers of some chemicals in a cell are of the order of @xmath1 or sometimes even @xmath0 .",
    "if such chemicals play only a minor role in a cell , we can safely ignore these chemicals to study intracellular chemical processes .",
    "however , this is not always the case . in biological systems , chemical species with a small number of molecules may critically affect the behavior of the entire system .",
    "as an extreme example , there exist only one or a few copies of genetic molecules such as dna , which are important to characterize the behavior of each cell .",
    "further , some experiments show that doses of particular chemicals at concentrations of the order of pm or fm may alter cell behavior ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "biological systems also include positive - feedback mechanisms such as autocatalytic reactions , which may amplify single molecular changes to a macroscopic level .",
    "it is only recently that the stochastic effect due to small molecule numbers in cells has been noticed both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the possible effects of molecular discreteness . through stochastic simulations , we showed that the discreteness can induce transitions to novel states in autocatalytic systems @xcite , which may affect macroscopic chemical concentrations @xcite . in the first part of this paper , we briefly review these studies and explain other aspects of such effects .",
    "see also @xcite for recent advances in the present topic by analytic methods and numerical simulations and @xcite for simulation methods concerned .    in some cases , the discreteness in the molecule numbers may cause switches between two or more states with distinct concentrations and dynamical behaviors .",
    "further , even though the concentration of chemicals is sufficiently high for one state , the concentration could be low in another state , in which a chemical with a very low concentration could work as a stochastic switch . in the second part of this paper ,",
    "we discuss how molecular discreteness leads to switch among states with distinct dynamical behaviors in an autocatalytic chemical reaction network system .",
    "this spontaneous switching is characterized as an alteration ( i.e. , disconnection and reconnection ) of the acting reaction paths .",

    "here , we briefly review that result by including some novel results .",
    "we consider a simple autocatalytic network ( loop ) with four chemicals @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we assume the reactions @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 ) between these chemicals .",
    "all the reactions are irreversible .",
    "we assume that the reactor is a well - stirred container with a volume @xmath17 .",
    "the set of @xmath10 , the number of @xmath24 molecules , determines the state of the system .",
    "the container is in contact with a chemical reservoir in which the concentration of @xmath24 is fixed at @xmath28 .",
    "the flow rate of @xmath24 between the container and the reservoir is @xmath29 , which corresponds to the probability of the flow - out of a molecule per unit time .",
    "is the diffusion rate across the surface of the container . here ,",
    "we choose a flow proportional to @xmath17 in order to obtain a well - defined continuum limit . ]",
    "we can consider the continuum limit as @xmath30 . in this limit",
    ", the change in @xmath31 , the chemical concentration of @xmath24 in the container , obeys the following rate equation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the rate constant of the reaction @xmath26 , and @xmath34 .    in @xcite",
    ", we considered a case with four equivalent chemical species , given as @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for all @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 . in the continuum limit , the dynamics is represented by the rate equation , which has only one attractor : a stable fixed point @xmath43 for all @xmath38 .",
    "around the fixed point , @xmath31 vibrates with the frequency @xmath44 .",
    "if the number of molecules is finite but fairly large , we can estimate the dynamical behavior of the system using the langevin equation , which is obtained by adding a noise term to the rate equation .",
    "each concentration @xmath31 fluctuates and vibrates around the fixed point .",
    "an increase in the noise ( corresponding to a decrease in the number of molecules ) merely amplifies the fluctuation .",
    "however , as we have shown in @xcite , when the number of molecules is small , novel states that do not exist in the continuum limit are observed .",
    "two chemicals are dominant and the other two are mostly extinct ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : a-032 ] shows the time series of @xmath10 in such a case . at @xmath46 , @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath48 dominate the system and @xmath49 for the most part ( the 1 - 3 rich state ) .",
    "once the system reaches @xmath49 , all the reactions stop .",
    "the system remains at @xmath49 for a long time as compared with the ordinary time scale of the reactions ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "conversely , at @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are large and usually @xmath54 ( the 2 - 4 rich state ) . in the 1 - 3 or 2 - 4 rich states , the system alternately switches between either @xmath11 and @xmath12 or @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we name these states the `` switching states . ''",
    "the appearance of discreteness - induced novel states is described as a phase transition with a decrease in the system size ( or flow rate ) , where the histogram of @xmath57 exhibits a change from single - peaked to double - peaked distribution .    in this example , although the state at each instant exhibits a clear transition , the average concentrations of the chemicals are not altered since the system resides equally in the 1 - 3 rich and 2 - 4 rich states over a long time span . on the other hand , we found examples in @xcite , where the long - term average concentration of the molecule species is altered by the discreteness as well .",
    "a simple example is provided by considering the same reaction model as that depicted by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tr1-rate ] ) , but by considering the case where the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath28 , or @xmath33 are species dependent .",
    "note that the rate equation ( [ eqn : tr1-rate ] ) obtained in the continuum limit does not contain the volume @xmath17 ; hence , the average concentrations should be independent of @xmath17 .",
    "here , we seek the possibility of the change in the average concentrations depending on the decrease in the system size @xmath17 by taking advantage of the switching states .",
    "recall that for the transitions to the switching states to occur in @xcite , it was necessary for the interval of the inflow to be greater than the time scale of the reactions . in the present case , the inflow interval of @xmath24 is @xmath58 , and the time scale of the reaction @xmath26 in order to consume @xmath24 is @xmath59 .",
    "if the conditions of all the chemicals are equivalent , the discreteness of all the chemicals takes effect equally and the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states coordinately appear at @xmath60 .",
    "now , since the parameters are species dependent , the effect of the discreteness may be different for each species .",
    "for example , by assuming that @xmath61 , the inflow interval of @xmath62 is greater than that of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the discreteness in the inflow of @xmath62 can be significant for larger @xmath17 .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we studied the case in which only the external concentrations ( chemical inflows ) @xmath28 were dependent on the species .",
    "based on the degree of @xmath64 , the discreteness - induced transition occurs successively with the decrease in @xmath17 , and the average concentrations of the chemicals take distinct values from those of the continuum limit case .",
    "similarly , we can study the effect of the discreteness when each of the chemical reaction rates @xmath33 is species dependant .",
    "in fact , the dependence of @xmath65 on @xmath17 in this case is different from the previous study in which only @xmath28 was species dependent .",
    "for example , we consider the case that @xmath66 and @xmath67 . figure [ fig : tr2-average - r ] shows the dependence of @xmath65 on @xmath17 .",
    "recall that the concentrations should not depend on @xmath17 as long as the continuum representations hold ( eq . ( [ eqn : tr1-rate ] ) does not contain @xmath17 ) . here , in the continuum limit or in the case of large @xmath17 , @xmath68 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tr2-average - r ] ( a ) . in contrast ,",
    "when @xmath17 is small , @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath17 is very small , so that the total number of molecules is mostly @xmath0 or @xmath1 , the reactions rarely occur and the flow of chemicals dominates the system .",
    "thus , @xmath69 .",
    "if both the reactions and the flows are species dependent , we can simply expect the behavior to be a combination of the above mentioned cases .",
    "even this simple system can exhibit a multi - step change in the concentrations along with the change in @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , the present behavior is not limited to the simple autocatalytic reaction loop .",
    "in fact , we observe this type of change in randomly connected reaction networks . for a large reaction network with multiple time scales of reactions and flows",
    ", the discreteness effect may bring about behaviors that are more complicated , although our discussion is generally applicable to such cases if the time scales are appropriately defined .    as seen above",
    ", the discreteness of molecules can alter the average concentrations . when the rates of inflow and/or the reaction are species dependent , the transitions between the discreteness - induced states are imbalanced .",
    "this may drastically alter the average concentrations from those of the continuum limit case .",
    "note that although the concentrations are altered in both cases , their dependence on @xmath17 is different .",
    "if the system is extremely small ( @xmath70 ) , the frequency of the reaction event , in comparison to the diffusion , is low .",
    "the reaction is limited by the inflows , and therefore , the system is dominated by diffusion .",

    "in contrast to the continuum limit , where decay or recovery of the chemical is gradual , such changes in the network structure are discrete and therefore quick .    here , we show an example in which the discreteness alters the actual network and switches the dynamical behavior . we adopt a simple model with four chemicals and five reactions among them ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : ts - v ] ( a ) , even though the concentrations fluctuate and vibrate around the fixed point .    with a small @xmath17",

    "the system spontaneously switches among these states .",

    ", the distribution shows a peak at around @xmath95 and @xmath96 , corresponding to the fixed point of the rate equation . for a small @xmath17",
    ", the distribution of @xmath74 shows peaks at around @xmath97 and @xmath98 , corresponding to state ii ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 ) and state iii ( mostly @xmath98 ) , respectively .",
    "as mentioned above , these states are classified based on the reactions that cease ; in other words , the states are classified based on the part of the network that actually functions .",
    "in state i , all the reactions in the network function ; in state ii , the autocatalytic loop does not function ; and in state iii , the conversion of @xmath62 into @xmath90 ceases .",
    "the transitions to states ii or iii can be viewed as the disconnection of some parts in the reaction network .",
    "such transitions are possible only if @xmath10 reaches @xmath0 , and therefore , molecular discreteness is essential .",
    "the extinction of the @xmath63 and @xmath90 molecules makes the system switch to states ii and iii , respectively .",
    "the question that arises here is as follows : in general , which chemicals can switch states in a network ? in our model , molecule @xmath62 can not serve as a switch , even though @xmath47 sometimes reaches @xmath0 in the case of @xmath72 .",
    "first , for a molecule species to function as a key for switching , @xmath10 should be maintained at @xmath0 for a longer time than that for other reactions .",
    "for @xmath62 , there is considerable inflow , and the inflow rate is not affected if @xmath47 reaches @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath47 can not remain at @xmath0 for a long time , and @xmath62 can not switch the dynamics .",
    "second , a key chemical for a switch should be located within the reaction paths and the extinction of the molecule disconnects some reaction paths .",
    "stochasticity in gene expression is widely studied with regard to the problem of a small number of molecules in a biological system .",
    "it is often assumed that two states  on and off  are switched by a single regulatory site . the controlling chemicals and controlled",
    "chemicals can be clearly separated .",
    "in contrast , our result shows that chemical species , which are usually abundant , may sometimes work as a stochastic switch . in this sense , molecules that are common or ions such as ca@xmath101 ( see @xcite ) may cause stochastic effects .",
    "the role of a chemical may change with time .",
    "in this study , we have demonstrated that molecular discreteness may induce transitions to novel states in autocatalytic reaction systems , which may result in an alteration of macroscopic properties such as the average chemical concentrations .    in biochemical pathways ,",
    "it is not uncommon to find that the number of molecules of a chemical is of the order of @xmath102 or less in a cell .",
    "there are thousands of protein species , and the total number of protein molecules in a cell is not very large .",
    "for example , in signal transduction pathways , some chemicals work at concentrations of less than @xmath103 molecules per cell .",
    "there exist only one or a few copies of genetic molecules such as dna ; furthermore , mrnas are not present in large numbers .",
    "thus , regulation mechanisms involving genes are quite stochastic .",
    "naturally , molecular discreteness involves such rare chemicals .    in the second part of this paper",
    ", we have shown that the molecular discreteness may change the dynamical behavior of reaction networks .",
    "the reaction network is virtually disconnected by the extinction of certain chemicals , which is not possible in the continuum limit .",
    "although the network studied here is a small model , similar phenomena can exist in a complex reaction network with a large number of chemicals and reactions .",
    "we have also investigated random networks of catalytic reactions @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) . in such systems ,",
    "the dynamics of chemical concentrations also depend on the system size @xmath17 . in a small system , many of the chemical species become extinct ( @xmath45 ) , and the actual reaction network is disconnected into fragments , which may be occasionally reconnected by inflow or generation of a molecule .",
    "the onset of change in the concentrations due to disconnection or reconnection is stochastic and sudden . in the continuum limit ,",
    "in contrast , the concentrations gradually converge to a fixed point in most cases ( or to a limit cycle or other attractors ) .",
    "the simple model in this paper can be viewed as a switching element of such a network ; however , the exact conditions that determine whether a chemical works as a stochastic switch or not should be addressed in future .",
    "we observed the transitions in the distribution of the concentrations @xmath31 with respect to the change in the system size @xmath17 .",
    "multiple transitions can also occur , especially if there are many chemical species for which the number of molecules is sometimes ( but not necessarily always ) small .    in this paper",
    ", we consider reactions in a well - stirred medium , where only the number of molecules is taken into account for determining the system behavior .",
    "however , if the system is not mixed well , we need to take into account the diffusion of molecules in space . from a biological viewpoint ,",
    "the diffusion in space is also important because the diffusion in cells is not always fast when compared with the time scales of the reactions . if the reactions are faster than the mixing , we should consider the system as a reaction - diffusion system , with discrete molecules diffusing in space .",
    "the relation between these time scales will be important , as indicated by mikhailov and hess @xcite . with regards to these time scales",
    ", we recently found that the spatial discreteness of molecules within the so - called kuramoto length @xcite , over which a molecule diffuses in its lifetime ( lapses before it undergoes reaction ) , can yield novel steady states that are not observed in the reaction - diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "spatial domain structures due to molecular discreteness are also observed @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for relevance of the discreteness in a replicating molecule system .",
    "the discreteness - induced effect present here does not depend on the characteristics of the reactions .",
    "furthermore , it may be applicable to systems beyond reactions , such as ecosystems or economic systems . the inflow of chemicals in a reaction system can be seen as a model of intrusion or evolution in an ecosystem : for both systems , discrete agents ( molecules or individuals ) may become extinct . in this",
    "regard , our result is relevant to the studies of ecosystems , e.g. , extinction dynamics with a replicator model by tokita and yasutomi @xcite ; strong dependence of the survival probability of new species in evolving networks on the population size was reported by ebeling _",
    "the discreteness of agents or operations might also be relevant to some economic models , e.g. , artificial markets .",
    "most mathematical methods that are applied to reaction systems can not appropriately describe the discreteness effect .",
    "although the utility of simulations with the progress in computer technology has become convenient , it would also be important to develop a theoretical formulation applicable to discrete reaction systems .",
    "on the other hand , in recent years , major advances have been made in the detection of a small number of molecules and the fabrication of small reactors , which raises the possibility to experimentally demonstrate the discreteness effect predicted here .",
    "we believe that molecular discreteness has latent but actual importance with respect to biological mechanisms such as pattern formation , regulation of biochemical pathways , or evolution , which will be pursued in the future .",
