    "there have been extensive studies by utilizing nonlinear effects enhanced by quantum coherences and interferences .",
    "for example , self-@xcite or cross- @xcite phase modulation based on kerr effect have been proposed using electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite , spontaneously generated coherences  @xcite or active raman gain  @xcite media , not only in gaseous - phase such as atomic alkali atoms , but also in solid - state media including optical fibers  @xcite , quantum wells  @xcite , and superconducting qubits  @xcite .",
    "several schemes have been experimentally tested in cold  @xcite or thermal atomic systems  @xcite , where small nonlinear phase shifts up to the order of one radian are achieved . since nonlinear effects are usually weak ,",

    "the phase modulation is based on the linear medium susceptibility and therefore does not depend on the intensity of the laser beam .",
    "the setup furthermore cancels paraxial diffraction by exploiting the thermal motion of atoms , such that no diffraction - induced nonuniform phase distribution over the transverse plane arises in the propagation .",
    "these advantages are illustrated in fig .",

    "the non - zero two - photon detuning at the same time leads to a linear constant dispersion acting on the probe field , inducing the desired phase modulation throughout the propagation .",
    "furthermore , the single - photon absorption due to the two - photon detuning can be compensated by the gain induced by the incoherent pump , since it will pump out the populations in the ground state and then redistribute the populations among the four states . via the coherent control field",

    "the probe field acquires a uniform @xmath1-phase modulation while experiencing neither diffraction nor absorption as it propagates through the thermal medium .",

    ", we follow the approach introduced in @xcite to calculate the linear susceptibility for the probe field in the thermal atomic medium under certain approximations : the control field and the incoherent pump field are taken as plane waves , the probe field is assumed to be much weaker than the control fields such that it can be treated as a perturbation to the system , the slowly - varying envelope and paraxial approximations are applied for the probe field , and the dicke limit is assumed .",
