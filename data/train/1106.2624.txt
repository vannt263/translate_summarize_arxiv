    "astrophysical models can explain the origin of most nuclei beyond the iron group as a combination of processes involving neutron captures on long ( @xmath12 process ) or short ( @xmath13 process ) time scales @xcite .",
    "however , 32 proton - rich stable isotopes between @xmath14se and @xmath15hg can not be formed by these neutron capture reactions because they are either shielded by stable isotopes from the @xmath13-process decay chains or lie outside the @xmath12-process reaction sequence .",
    "these isotopes are attributed to a so - called `` @xmath16 process '' , and are 10 to 100 times less abundant than the neighboring @xmath12 and @xmath13 nuclei .",
    "the astrophysical details of the @xmath16 process are still under discussion and it is conceivable that several different nucleosynthesis processes and sites may conspire to produce all of the @xmath16 nuclei . the currently favored astrophysical site is explosive burning in core collapse supernovae , where a shock front heats the o / ne shell of the progenitor star to temperatures of 23  gk , causing photodisintegration of pre - existing seed nuclei @xcite .",
    "the seed nuclei are partly already present in the proto - stellar cloud from which the star formed and are partly created in the weak @xmath12 process during hydrostatic burning preceding the explosion .",
    "the very rare @xmath16 nuclei @xmath17la and @xmath18ta@xmath19 can not be made in this manner but rather originate from neutrino - induced reactions ( @xmath20 process @xcite ) .",
    "such a synthesis of proton - rich nuclei by sequences of photodissociations and @xmath21 decays is also termed `` @xmath1 process '' @xcite .",
    "the reaction sequences start with ( @xmath22 ) reactions at stability , producing proton - richer , unstable nuclei which , in turn , are further disintegrated .",
    "when ( @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 ) reactions become comparable to or faster than neutron emission within an isotopic chain , the reaction path is deflected and feeds chains with lower charge number @xmath25 .",
    "the decrease in temperature at later stages of the @xmath16 process leads to freeze - out via neutron captures and @xmath21 decays , resulting in the typical @xmath16-process abundance pattern with maxima at @xmath26mo ( @xmath27=50 ) and @xmath28sm ( @xmath27=82 ) .",
    "calculations based on the @xmath1 process concept can produce the bulk of the @xmath16 nuclei @xcite . however , the most abundant @xmath16 isotopes , @xmath29mo and @xmath30ru , as well as the whole region @xmath31@xmath32124 are notoriously underproduced",
    ". additionally , the mass region 150@xmath33@xmath31@xmath33165 also seems underproduced in modern , self - consistent models @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the observed underproductions are due to deficiencies in the astrophysical modeling or in the nuclear physics input .",
    "the lack of seed nuclei for the production of the light @xmath16 nuclei indicates the former for the lighter mass region but reliable nuclear physics input is important in both regions .",
    "alternatives to the core - collapse supernova scenario ( e.g. , explosion of a mass - accreting white dwarf @xcite or sub - chandrasekhar mass white dwarf @xcite , rapid proton captures in x - ray bursts @xcite and in the @xmath34 process @xcite ) still suffer from insufficient modeling , constraints from meteoritic data @xcite , and their uncertain contribution to the total galactic nucleosynthesis . in any case , reliable reaction rates are instrumental for developing a consistent @xmath16-process picture .    from the mere size of the nuclear reaction network for the @xmath16 process , which includes about 1800 isotopes and more than ten thousand reactions mostly with unstable nuclei ,",
    "it becomes obvious that the vast majority of reaction rates has to be determined theoretically .",
    "the experimental database for the @xmath16 process is  despite many efforts in the last years  still very limited , because measurements of the small cross sections of charged - particle reactions below the coulomb barrier represent a continuing experimental challenge . in this work we present the results of ( @xmath35 ) and ( @xmath36 ) reaction studies on several pd isotopes ( as indicated in fig .",
    "[ pd - chain ] ) close to the astrophysically relevant energies of the @xmath16 process @xcite .",
    "the importance of the measured ( @xmath35 ) reactions for the @xmath16 process is twofold .",
    "firstly , theoretical predictions for their cross sections can be tested in order to improve the nuclear reaction modeling for the @xmath1 process . secondly",
    ", reaction rates derived from the measurements can directly be included in reaction networks for @xmath16 nucleosynthesis .",
    "the deflections in the @xmath1-process path are governed by ( @xmath23 ) reactions in the lighter mass range @xcite .",
    "although the ( @xmath23 ) rate will dominate over ( @xmath35 ) in the @xmath1 process , it has been shown that it is always more advantageous to measure the capture rate and derive its inverse rate by application of detailed balance @xcite .",
    "this is because the reaction rate has to include the thermal population of excited target states in the astrophysical plasma which leads to cross section modifications relative to the cross section of the reaction proceeding only via the ground state of a target nucleus .",
    "since only the latter can be studied in the laboratory it is desirable to measure in the direction of least alteration due to stellar plasma effects .",
    "the stellar enhancement factor @xmath37 is defined as the ratio of the stellar rate @xmath38 , including reactions from thermally populated states of the target nucleus , and the laboratory rate @xmath39 with reactions proceeding only from the ground state of the target nucleus @xcite . for the @xmath16 process",
    ", the sef is always smaller for capture than for photodisintegration @xcite .",
    "the importance of ( @xmath40 ) reactions for the lower mass range of @xmath16 nuclei has been pointed out in @xcite . for proton - rich nuclei , ( @xmath40 )",
    "reactions have a positive reaction @xmath41 value and are in general less affected by stellar plasma effects than ( @xmath36 ) reactions .",
    "however , it was pointed out recently that the stellar cross section modification can be suppressed by the coulomb barrier and that the sef may be lower for some ( @xmath36 ) reactions than for their ( @xmath40 ) counterpart @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath6pd(@xmath36)@xmath6ag is such a case among the reactions presented here .",
    "its sefs are only @xmath42 in the relevant plasma temperature range of @xmath43 gk , compared to sefs of @xmath44 for its inverse reaction . for the other ( @xmath36 ) reactions presented in this work",
    ", we could only determine partial cross sections to the ground or isomeric state .",
    "these can not be directly converted to astrophysical reaction rates but can be used  with the aid of theoretical calculations  to test the description of the proton optical potential , which is also essential in the prediction of the capture and photodisintegration rates .",
