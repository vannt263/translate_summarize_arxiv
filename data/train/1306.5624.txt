    "the study of the dynamics of planetary systems is a long standing and challenging problem .",
    "the classical perturbation theory , mainly developed by lagrange and laplace , uses the circular approximation as a reference for the orbits .",
    "the discovery of extrasolar planetary systems has opened a new field in celestial mechanics and nowadays more than @xmath1 multi - planetary systems have been discovered .",
    "in contrast to the solar system , where the orbits of the planets are almost circular , the exoplanets usually describe true ellipses with high eccentricities .",
    "thus , the applicability of the classical approach , using the circular approximation as a reference , can be doubtful for these systems . in this work",
    "we revisit the classical laplace - lagrange theory for the secular motions of the pericenters of the planetary orbits , based only on a linear approximation of the dynamical equations , by considering also higher order terms .",
    "previous works of @xcite for coplanar systems have generalized the classical expansion of the perturbative potential to a higher order in the eccentricities , showing that this analytical model gives an accurate description of the behavior of planetary systems which are not close to a mean - motion resonance , up to surprisingly high eccentricities .",
    "moreover , they have shown that an expansion up to order @xmath2 in the eccentricities is usually required for reproducing the secular behavior of extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "this expansion has also been used by @xcite to successfully reproduce the motions of irregular satellites with eccentricities up to  @xmath3 . @xcite",
    "have highlighted the limitations of lower order expansions ; using only a fourth - order expansion in the eccentricities , they did not reproduce , even qualitatively , the secular dynamics of extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "all the previous results have been obtained considering a secular hamiltonian at order one in the masses .",
    "let us also remark that an alternative _ octupole - level _ secular theory has been developed for systems that exhibit _ hierarchical behavior _ ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . however , this approach is not suitable for our study , as we will also consider systems with large semi - major axes ratio .",
    "considering the secular dynamics of the solar system , lagrange and laplace showed that the proximity to the @xmath4:@xmath5 mean - motion resonance between jupiter and saturn leads to large perturbations in the secular motion , explaining the so - called `` great inequality '' .",
    "let us stress that when referring to _ secular evolution _",
    "we mean long - term evolution , possibly including the long - term effects of near resonances .",
    "indeed the terms of the perturbation associated to mean - motion resonances have small frequencies and thus influence the secular behavior of the system .",
    "a good description of the secular dynamics of an exoplanetary system should include the effects of the mean - motion resonances on their secular long - term evolution .",
    "therefore , we replace the classical circular approximation with a torus which is invariant up to order two in the masses , this is the so - called hamiltonian at order two in the masses . the benefit of a second order approach has been clearly highlighted in @xcite , see table 2 in that paper , where a comparison between the fundamental frequencies of the planetary motion of the solar system , is given for different approximations . concerning the problem of the stability of the solar system , the celebrated theorems of kolmogorov and nekhoroshev allowed to make substantial progress .",
    "nevertheless , in order to apply these theorems , a crucial point is to consider the secular hamiltonian at order two in the masses in order to have a good approximation of the secular dynamics ( e.g. ,  this allows , in @xcite , to deal with the true values of the planetary masses , while the first order approximation used in @xcite forces the authors to reduce the masses of the planets by a factor 10 ) . in recent years , the estimates for the applicability of both kolmogorov and nekhoroshev theorems to realistic models of some part of the solar system",
    "have been improved by some authors ( e.g. ,  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .    in the present contribution ,",
    "we study the secular dynamics of extrasolar planetary systems consisting of two coplanar planets .",
    "the aim is to reconstruct the evolution of the eccentricities and pericenters of the planets by using analytical techniques , extending the laplace - lagrange theory to order two in the masses .",
    "to do so , we extend the results in @xcite , replacing the first order averaged hamiltonian , with the one at order two in the masses , and show the improvements of this approximation on the study of the secular evolution of extrasolar systems . in particular , we determine the fundamental frequencies of the motion and compute analytically the long - term evolution of the keplerian elements .",
    "furthermore , we show that the hamiltonian at order two in the masses describes accurately the secular dynamics of systems close to a mean - motion resonance and , as a byproduct , we also give an estimate of the proximity to a mean - motion resonance of the two - planet extrasolar systems discovered so far .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : expansion ] , we describe the expansion of the hamiltonian of the planar three - body problem in poincar variables . following the lagrange approach , we focus , in section  [ sec : secular ] , on the secular part of the hamiltonian and derive the secular hamiltonian at order two in the masses . in section  [ sec : actang ] , we construct a high - order birkhoff normal form , using the lie series method , that leads to a very simple form of the equations of motion , being function of the actions only .",
    "we also show how to compute the secular frequencies and perform a long - term analytical integration of the motion of the planets . in section  [ sec : andromedae ] , we apply our method to the @xmath0 andromedae system and show that the second order approximation is well suited for systems close to a mean - motion resonance .",
    "furthermore , the influence of the mean anomaly on the long - term evolution is pointed out in section  [ sec : m ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "proxy ] , we set up a criterion to evaluate the proximity of planetary systems to mean - motion resonances , and apply it to the two - planet extrasolar systems discovered so far . finally , our results are summarized in section  [ sec : results ] . an appendix containing the expansion of the secular hamiltonian of the @xmath0 andromedae extrasolar system , up to order",
    "@xmath6 , follows .",
    "we consider a system of three coplanar point bodies , mutually interacting according to newton s gravitational law , consisting of a central star @xmath7 of mass @xmath8 and two planets @xmath9 and @xmath10 of mass @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the indices @xmath13 and @xmath5 refer to the inner and outer planet , respectively .",
    "let us now recall how the classical poincar variables can be introduced to perform the expansion of the hamiltonian around circular orbits .",
    "we follow the formalism introduced by poincar ( see @xcite ; for a modern exposition , see , e.g. ,  @xcite and @xcite ) . to remove the motion of the center of mass , we adopt the heliocentric coordinates , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 . denoting by @xmath16 the momenta conjugated to @xmath17 , the hamiltonian of the system has four degrees of freedom , and reads @xmath18 where @xmath19    the plane set of poincar canonical variables is introduced as @xmath20 for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the semi - major axis , the eccentricity , the mean anomaly and the longitude of the pericenter of the @xmath24-th planet , respectively .",
    "one immediately sees that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are of the same order as the eccentricity @xmath27 . using the poincar canonical variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the keplerian part and @xmath30 the perturbation .",
    "let us emphasize that the ratio @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the time derivative of each variable is of order @xmath33 , except for @xmath34 . for this reason we will refer to @xmath35 as the _ fast variables _ and to @xmath36 as the _",
    "secular variables_.    we proceed now by expanding the hamiltonian   in taylor - fourier series .",
    "we pick a fixed value @xmath37 of the fast actions and perform a translation , @xmath38 , defined as @xmath39 this canonical transformation leaves the coordinates @xmath34 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 unchanged .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian @xmath42 can be expanded in power series of @xmath43 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 around the origin .",
    "forgetting an unessential constant , we rearrange the hamiltonian of the system as @xmath44 where the functions @xmath45 are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath46 in the fast actions @xmath43 , degree @xmath47 in the secular variables @xmath36 , and depend analytically and periodically on the angles @xmath34 .",
    "the terms @xmath48 of the keplerian part are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath46 in the fast actions @xmath43 .",
    "we also expand @xmath45 in fourier series of the angles @xmath34 . in the latter equation",
    ", the term which is both linear in the actions and independent of all the other canonical variables ( i.e. ,  @xmath49 ) has been isolated in view of its relevance in perturbation theory , as it will be discussed in the next section .",
    "all the expansions were carried out using a specially devised algebraic manipulator ( see @xcite ) . in our computations",
    "we truncate the expansion as follows .",
    "the keplerian part is expanded up to the quadratic terms .",
    "the terms @xmath45 include the linear terms in the fast actions @xmath43 , all terms up to degree @xmath2 in the secular variables @xmath36 and all terms up to the trigonometric degree @xmath2 with respect to the angles @xmath34 .",
    "the choice of the limits in the expansion is uniform for all the systems that will be considered .",
    "however , as we will explain in the next section , the actual limits for the computation of the secular approximation will be chosen as the lowest possible orders in @xmath34 and @xmath36 , so as to include the main effects of the proximity to a mean - motion resonance .",
    "in this section we discuss the procedure for computing the secular hamiltonian via elimination of the fast angles .",
    "the classical approach , usually found in the literature , consists in replacing the hamiltonian @xmath50 , defined in  , by @xmath51 the idea is that the effects due to the fast angles are negligible on the long - term evolution and this averaged hamiltonian represents a `` good approximation '' of the secular dynamics .",
    "this approach has been critically considered by arnold , quoting his book ( i.e. , @xcite , chapter 10 ) _",
    "`` this principle is neither a theorem , an axiom , nor a definition , but rather a physical proposition , i.e. , a vaguely formulated and , strictly speaking , untrue assertion .",
    "such assertion are often fruitful sources of mathematical theorems.''_.    the secular hamiltonian obtained in this way is the so - called approximation at _ order one in the masses _ ( or `` averaging by scissors '' ) and is the basis of the laplace - lagrange theory for the secular motion of perihelia and nodes of the planetary orbits .",
    "this approximation corresponds to fixing the value of @xmath52 , that remains constant under the flow , and thereby the semi - major axes .",
    "the averaged hamiltonian , depending only on the secular variables , reduces the problem to a system with two degrees of freedom .",
    "let us remark that the laplace - lagrange secular theory was developed just considering the linear approximation of the dynamical equations .",
    "an extension of the laplace - lagrange theory for extrasolar systems , including also terms of higher order in the eccentricities , can be found in  @xcite , where the authors show that a secular hamiltonian at order one in the masses gives an accurate description of the long - term behavior for systems which are not close to a mean - motion resonance .",
    "one of the main achievements of the laplace - lagrange secular theory is the explanation of the `` great inequality '' between jupiter and saturn .",
    "indeed , they have shown that the near commensurability of the two mean - motions ( the @xmath4:@xmath5 near resonance ) has a great impact on the long - term behavior of the solar system .",
    "for that reason , a good description of the secular dynamics of an exoplanetary system should include a careful treatment of the influence of mean - motion resonances on the long - term evolution .",
    "our purpose is to consider a secular hamiltonian at _ order two in the masses_. the idea is to remove perturbatively the dependency on the fast angles from the hamiltonian  , considering terms up to order two in the masses .",
    "this can be done using the classical generating functions of the hamilton - jacobi formalism . here instead we use the lie series formalism and implement the procedure in a way that takes into account the kolmogorov algorithm for the construction of an invariant torus ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "this is only a technical point and does not affect the results , our choice is a question of convenience since the lie series approach is a direct method and is much more effective from the computational point of view ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .      let us recall that in the expansion of the hamiltonian @xmath50 , see  , the perturbation is of order one in the masses and it is a polynomial in @xmath43 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and a trigonometric polynomial in the fast angles @xmath34 .",
    "we remove part of the dependence on the fast angles performing a `` kolmogorov - like '' normalization step , in the following sense .",
    "the suggestion of kolmogorov is to give the hamiltonian the normal form @xmath53 , for which the existence of an invariant torus @xmath54 is evident ( where we consider the secular variables just as parameters ) .",
    "we give the hamiltonian the latter form up to terms of order @xmath55 .",
    "more precisely , we perform a canonical transformation which removes the dependence on the fast angles from terms which are independent of and linear in the fast actions @xmath43 ( i.e. , equations   and  , respectively ) . therefore we replace the circular orbits of the laplace - lagrange theory with an approximate invariant torus , thus establishing a better approximation as the starting point of the classical theory .",
    "we also take into account the effects of near mean - motion resonances by including in the averaging process the corresponding resonant harmonics , as will be detailed hereafter .",
    "the procedure is a little cumbersome , and here we give only a sketch of the main path . for",
    "a detailed exposition one can refer to  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the hamiltonian @xmath50 , see  , in view of the dalembert rules ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ; see also @xcite for a modern approach ) , contains only specific combinations of terms .",
    "let us consider the harmonic @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , and introduce the so - called `` characteristic of the inequality '' @xmath58 the degree in the secular variables of the non - zero terms appearing in the expansion must have the same parity of @xmath59 and is at least equal to @xmath60 .",
    "it is well known that the terms of the expansion that have the main influence on the secular evolution are the ones related to low order mean - motion resonances .",
    "therefore , if the ratio @xmath61 is close to the rational approximation @xmath62 , then the effects due to the harmonics @xmath63 should be taken into account in the secular hamiltonian .",
    "let us also recall that the coefficients of the fourier expansion decay exponentially with @xmath64 , so we just need to consider low order resonances .",
    "let us go into details .",
    "consider a system close to the @xmath65 mean - motion resonance and define the vector @xmath66 and two integer parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 the fourier expansion of a function @xmath69 truncated in such a way that we keep only the harmonics satisfying the restriction @xmath70 .",
    "the effect of the near mean - motion resonances is taken into account by choosing the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 as the lowest limits that include the corresponding resonant harmonics .",
    "using the lie series algorithm to calculate the canonical transformations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and @xcite ) , we transform the hamiltonian   as @xmath73 , with the generating function @xmath74 determined by solving the equation @xmath75 notice that , by definition , the average over the fast angles of @xmath76 is zero , which assures that   can be solved provided that the frequencies are non resonant up to order @xmath72 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath77 has the same form as @xmath50 in  , with the functions @xmath45 replaced by new ones , @xmath78 , generated by expanding the lie series @xmath79 and gathering all the terms having the same degree both in the fast actions and in the secular variables .",
    "we now perform a second canonical transformation @xmath80 , where the generating function @xmath81 , which is linear with respect to @xmath43 , is determined by solving the equation @xmath82 again ,   can be solved provided the frequencies are non resonant up to order @xmath72 and the hamiltonian @xmath83 can be written in a form similar to  , namely @xmath84 where the new functions @xmath85 are computed as previously explained for @xmath86 and still have the same dependence on their arguments as @xmath45 in  . as we are interested in a second order approximation , we have neglected the contribution of the order @xmath87 in the canonical transformations associated to and .",
    "following a common practice in perturbation theory , we denote again by @xmath88 the transformed coordinates .    in the following ,",
    "we will denote by @xmath89 the canonical transformation induced by the generating functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 , namely @xmath92    let us remark that the non resonant condition @xmath93 does not imply that the canonical change of coordinates is convergent .",
    "indeed , the terms @xmath94 that appear as the denominators of the generating functions , even if they do not vanish , can produce the so - called _ small divisors_. it is well known that the presence of small divisors is a major problem in perturbation theory .",
    "therefore , for each system considered in this work , we check that the canonical transformation @xmath89 is near to the identity and only in that case we proceed computing the approximation at order two in the masses .      starting from the hamiltonian @xmath95 in  , we just need to perform an average over the fast angles @xmath34 .",
    "more precisely , we consider the averaged hamiltonian @xmath96 namely we set @xmath97 and average @xmath95 by removing all the fourier harmonics depending on the angles .",
    "this results in replacing the orbit having zero eccentricity with an invariant torus of the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian so constructed is the secular one , describing the slow motion of the eccentricities and pericenters . concerning the approximation at order one in the masses ,",
    "let us recall that we directly average the hamiltonian @xmath50 , see equation  .",
    "after the averaging over the fast angles , the secular hamiltonian has two degrees of freedom and , in view of the dalembert rules , contains only terms of even degree in @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the lowest order approximation of the secular hamiltonian , namely its quadratic part , is essentially the one considered in the laplace - lagrange theory .",
    "the origin @xmath98 is an elliptic equilibrium point , and it is well known that one can find a linear canonical transformation @xmath99 which diagonalizes the quadratic part of the hamiltonian , so that we may write @xmath100 in the new coordinates as @xmath101 where @xmath102 are the secular frequencies in the small oscillations limit and @xmath103 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath104 in @xmath105 .    to illustrate the transformations described hereabove , the secular hamiltonian , @xmath100 , of the @xmath0 andromedae extrasolar system ( see section [ sec : andromedae ] for a detailed description of the system and a discussion on its proximity to the @xmath4:@xmath13 mean - motion resonance )",
    "is reported in appendix  [ app : sec ] .",
    "first and second order approximations in the masses , including terms up to order @xmath6 in @xmath36 , are given .",
    "following @xcite , we now aim to introduce an action - angle formulation , since its associated equations of motion are extremely simple and can be integrated analytically .",
    "the secular hamiltonian   has the form of a perturbed system of harmonic oscillators , and thus we can construct a birkhoff normal form ( see @xcite ) introducing action - angle coordinates for the secular variables , by means of lie series ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . finally , an analytical integration of the action - angle equations will allow us to check the accuracy of our secular approximation , by comparing it to a direct numerical integration of the newton equations .",
    "as the construction of the birkhoff normal form via lie series is explained in detail in many previous studies , here we just briefly recall it , adapted to the present context .",
    "first , we define a canonical transformation @xmath106 introducing the usual action - angle variables @xmath107 the secular hamiltonian in these variables reads @xmath108    in order to remove the dependency of the secular angles @xmath109 in this expression , we compute the birkhoff normal form up to order @xmath110 , @xmath111 where @xmath112 , for @xmath113 , is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath114 in @xmath115 and is zero for odd @xmath116 . only the remainder ,",
    "@xmath117 , depends also on the angles @xmath109 .",
    "again , with a little abuse of notation , we denote by @xmath118 the new coordinates . at each order @xmath119 , we determine the generating function @xmath120 , by solving the equation @xmath121    using the lie series , we calculate the new hamiltonian as @xmath122 , provided that the non - resonance condition @xmath123 is fulfilled .",
    "let us remark that , considering the hamiltonian at order two in the masses , the birkhoff normal form is not always convergent at high order , especially when the eccentricities are significant or the system is _ too close _ to a mean - motion resonance .",
    "indeed , in these cases , the transformation @xmath89 , which brings the hamiltonian at order two in the masses , induces a big change in the coefficients of the secular hamiltonian , that can prevent the convergence of the normalization procedure . on the contrary , the algorithm seems to be convergent at first order in the masses ( see the _ convergence au sens des astronomes _ in @xcite ) .    assuming that the non - resonance conditions   are satisfied up to an order @xmath110 large enough , the remainder @xmath124 can be neglected and we easily obtain an analytical expression of the secular frequencies .",
    "indeed , the equations of motion for the truncated hamiltonian are @xmath125 and lead immediately to the expression of the two frequencies @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "let us remark that , as the generating functions of the lie series depend only on the angular difference @xmath128 , the frequency of the apsidal difference @xmath129 is equal to @xmath130 .      using the equations in",
    ", we can compute the long - term evolution on the secular invariant torus , namely @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 correspond to the values of the initial conditions . to validate our results",
    ", we will compare our analytical integration with the direct numerical integration of the full three - body problem , by using the symplectic integrator @xmath134 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "here we briefly explain how the analytical computation of the secular evolution of the orbital elements is performed .",
    "let us denote by @xmath135 the canonical transformation induced by the birkhoff normalization up to the order @xmath110 , namely @xmath136 we denote by @xmath137 the composition of all the canonical changes of coordinates defined in sections  [ sec : expansion][sec : actang ] , namely @xmath138 taking the initial conditions @xmath139 , we can compute the evolution of the orbital elements by using the following scheme @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the non - canonical change of coordinates  .",
    "thus , the analytical integration via normal form actually reduces to a transformation of the initial conditions to secular action - angles coordinates , the computation of the flow at time @xmath142 in these coordinates , followed by a transformation back to the original orbital elements .",
    "let us stress that , considering only the secular evolution , the scheme above commutes only if @xmath110 is equal to infinity .    in the following sections , we will compare , for several extrasolar systems , the analytical secular evolution of the eccentricities and apsidal difference with the results of a direct numerical integration .",
    "this kind of comparison has been shown to be a very stressing test ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and @xcite ) for the accuracy of the whole algorithm constructing the normal form .",
    "andromedae system ( @xmath143 ) , obtained in three different ways : ( i )  direct numerical integration via @xmath134 ( green curves ) ; ( ii )  second order approximation ( red curves ) ; ( iii )  first order approximation ( blue curves ) .",

    "d _ has been modified to be closer to the @xmath4:@xmath13 resonance . for @xmath144 ( left panel ) ,",
    "the secular approximation at order two in the masses is still efficient , while it is no more suitable for @xmath145 ( right panel ) . ]",
    "we aim to investigate the improvements of the secular approximation at order two in the masses , introduced in the previous sections , in describing the long - term evolution of extrasolar systems close to a mean - motion resonance .",
    "the planetary system @xmath0 andromedae _ c _ and _ d _ is well known for his proximity to the @xmath4:@xmath13 mean - motion resonance .",
    "this has notably been confirmed analytically in @xcite , where the authors argued that a first order approximation gives a good _ qualitative _ approximation of the secular dynamics of the system . in the following ,",
    "we show that a second order approximation can _ quantitatively _ enhance the determination of the secular frequencies , as well as the extremal values of the eccentricities and difference in apsidal angles reached during the long - term evolution of the planets . for this study",
    ", we use the orbital parameters reported in @xcite mutual inclination of the two planets ( @xcite ) and a fourth planet in the system ( @xcite ) have been introduced . ] .    in order to take into account the proximity of the system to the @xmath4:@xmath13 mean - motion resonance",
    ", we must include , in the approximation at order two in the masses , the effects of all the terms up to the trigonometric degree @xmath6 in the fast angles and up to degree @xmath146 in the secular variables , namely we set @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( see the definitions in subsection 3.1 ) .",
    "after having constructed the secular approximation , we perform a birkhoff normal form up to order @xmath149 ( see subsection 4.1 ) , which corresponds to taking into account the secular variables up to order @xmath2 .    in figure  [ figandro ] , we report the long - term evolution of the eccentricities ( top panel ) and difference of the longitudes of the pericenters ( bottom panel ) obtained analytically with our second order approximation ( red curves ) .",
    "we compare it to the direct numerical integration of the full three - body problem ( i.e. ,  including the fast motions ) in heliocentric canonical variables ( green curves ) .",
    "the agreement between both curves is excellent ; the second order theory reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the results of the numerical integration . a comparison with the first order approximation is also shown ( blue curves ) and gives evidence of the improvement of the second order approximation for systems close to a mean - motion resonance .",
    "to highlight the dependency on the truncation parameters , we report , in the table below , the values of the secular period for different values of @xmath72 and @xmath71 .",
    "the period obtained via numerical integration is @xmath150 years .",
    "as expected , higher values of the truncation parameters allow to obtain better results , but with a higher computational cost . as already shown in figure  [ figandro ] , the main correction on the secular evolution is achieved when considering the terms related to the @xmath4:@xmath13 mean - motion resonance , i.e. , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this validates our choice of the truncation limits ."
