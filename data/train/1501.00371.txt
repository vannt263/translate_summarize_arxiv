    "there have long been concerns on the connection between skin friction and wall heat - transfer rate ( or simply , heat transfer ) , as macroscopically the two quantities are related respectively to the normal gradient of velocity and temperature , and microscopically they are momentum and energy transports arising from molecular moves and collisions .",
    "the most famous result of this subject is the reynolds analogy in the flat plate boundary layer flow problem , where the skin friction and heat transfer were found proportional along the surface .",
    "but such simple relationship does not exist for curved surfaces .",
    "for example , in flows past circular cylinders or spheres the heat transfer reaches its maximum at the stagnation point and diminishes monotonously downstream while the skin friction is zero at the stagnation point and varies non - monotonically downstream . with regard to the relation between skin friction and heat transfer ,",
    "there has not yet been a theory suitable for the curved surfaces in either continuum or rarefied gas flows .",
    "separately speaking , the heat transfer in hypersonic flows has received much more attentions than the skin friction due to early engineering requirements .",
    "lees @xcite first developed theories of the heat transfer to blunt - nosed bodies in hypersonic flows based on laminar boundary layer equations .",
    "the method made rational predictions in high reynolds number flows .",
    "later fay and riddell @xcite gave more detailed discussions on the stagnation point heat transfer and developed prediction formulas with improved accuracy .",
    "considering the downstream region of the stagnation point , kemp et al .",
    "@xcite made an improvement to extend the theory to more general conditions . in practice ,",
    "empirical formulas of the heat transfer distribution were also constructed for typical nose shapes such as circular cylinders and spheres @xcite .",
    "besides above boundary layer analyses in continuum flows , theoretical studies of heat transfer in rarefied gas flows have been carried out by different approaches .",
    "cheng @xcite accepted the thin viscous shock layer equations and obtained analytical expressions of the stagnation point heat transfer from the boundary layer flow to the free molecular flow .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite presented a theoretical modelling of the non - fourier aeroheating performance at the stagnation point based on the burnett equations .",
    "a control parameter @xmath0 was derived as the criterion of the local rarefied gas effects , and formulas based on the parameter were found to correlate the heat transfer both at the stagnation point and in the downstream region .",
    "unlike the heat transfer , the skin friction is often neglected in continuum flows over large blunt bodies , for the friction drag is much less than the pressure drag in those conditions .",
    "most of the existing studies concerns only about turbulence flows rather than laminar flows .",
    "however for wedges or cones with small angles in rarefied gas flows , the skin friction contributes a significant part , as much as @xmath1 , in the total drag @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is still no reliable theory we could use to predict the skin friction over curved surfaces",
    ". it will be meaningful if we find a general reynolds analogy by using which we could estimate the skin friction based on available heat transfer prediction formulas , or vice versa . in lees and the followers research on the aeroheating performance of blunt bodies ,",
    "the momentum equations were solved coupled with the energy equation of boundary layer flows , which offers a breakthrough point to analyze the relation between the skin friction and the heat transfer .    in the present work ,",
    "the ratio of skin friction to heat transfer along curved surfaces is firstly discussed based on the self - similar solution of boundary layer equations . an expression with simple form",
    "is obtained for circular cylinders as a typical example .",
    "subsequently , an extended analogy is deduced in the near continuum flow regime by considering the non - linear shear and heat transfer in the burnett approximation , and it is found the rarefied gas effects on the analogy are characterized by the rarefied flow criterion introduced in our previous study . as a preliminary study , the molecular vibration and chemical reaction effects are out of consideration in the theoretical analysis .",
    "the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method @xcite is also used to simulate present flows to validate the theoretical results .",

    "<S> in this paper , the relation between skin friction and heat transfer along windward sides of blunt - nosed bodies in hypersonic flows is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the self - similar boundary layer analysis is accepted to figure out the distribution of the ratio of skin friction to heat transfer coefficients along the wall . </S>",
    "<S> it is theoretically obtained that the ratio depends linearly on the local slope angle of the wall surface , and an explicit analogy expression is presented for circular cylinders , although the linear distribution is also found for other nose shapes and even in gas flows with chemical reactions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , based on the theoretical modelling of the second order shear and heat transfer terms in burnett equations , a modified analogy is derived in the near continuum regime by considering the rarefied gas effects . and a bridge function is also constructed to describe the nonlinear analogy in the transition flow regime . at last , </S>",
    "<S> the direct simulation monte carlo method is used to validate the theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> the general analogy , beyond the classical reynolds analogy , is applicable to both flat plates and blunt - nosed bodies , in either continuous or rarefied hypersonic flows . </S>",
