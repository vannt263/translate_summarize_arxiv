    "with the discovery of cosmic acceleration @xcite the quest for modeling dark energy @xcite has started . besides the most simple cosmological constant , other models based on various perfect fluids with negative pressure , like chaplygin gas @xcite , minimally and non - minimally coupled scalar fields and fields having non - standard kinetic terms kinetic , tachyons were advanced .",
    "the latter ones include as a subclass the models based on different forms of the born - infeld - type action , which is often associated with the tachyons arising in the context of string theory @xcite .",
    "due to the non - linearity of the dependence of the tachyon lagrangians on the kinetic term of the tachyon field , the dynamics of the corresponding cosmological models appears to be very rich .",
    "the tachyon model studied in paper @xcite contains a 2-fluid analogue scalar field @xmath2 , the dynamics of which is given by a simple potential , depending on two parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "the model is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "a phase space diagram in the tachyonic field and its derivative @xmath4 shows 5 type of distinct cosmological evolutions possibly occurring for the model , some of them containing regimes where @xmath5 is superluminal .",
    "all evolutions originate from one of the big bangs of the model , but they either end in a de sitter infinite exponential expansion , as the @xmath3cdm model does , or in a future singularity characterized by a regular scale factor @xmath6 , vanishing hubble parameter @xmath7 and energy density @xmath8 , but infinite @xmath5 and pressure @xmath9 .",
    "most notably , the second time derivative of the scale factor goes to @xmath10 , the reason why we call this singularity a big brake .    a kinematical analysis @xcite predicted the existence of such singularities , named sudden future singularities . from a combined kinematical and observational reasoning alone , sudden future singularities could occur as early as in ten million years @xcite , however no underlying dynamics is known to support this .",
    "classically the big brake singularity is stable .",
    "this can be seen by a series expansion of the scale factor in the vicinity of the singularity and checking the stability conditions advanced in ref .",
    "its quantum study indicated singularity avoidance @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite the compatibility of the model with type ia supernovae observation has been investigated .",
    "after we present some basic features of the model in section 2 , in section 3 we give more details on this compatibility check , in terms of the original variables employed in ref . @xcite",
    "then in section 4 we stress the crucial difference between negative and positive values of the model parameter @xmath1 . while for the former all evolutions end in the de sitter attractor , for positive @xmath1 the 1@xmath11 contour compatible with type ia supernovae contains both states which evolve into de sitter or into a big brake . in this dynamical model",
    "the big brake can occur no earlier than @xmath12 years .",
    "the big brake singularity belongs to the class of soft cosmological singularities , which also includes other representants @xcite .",
    "other types of singularities arising in the study of various dark energy models include the big rip singularity @xcite , present in some models with phantom dark energy @xcite .",
    "the possibility of existence of a phase of contraction of the universe , ending up in the standard big crunch cosmological singularity was also considered @xcite .    _",
    "unit convention : _ the newtonian constant is normalized as @xmath13 and we take @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the flat friedmann universe @xmath15where @xmath16 is the spatial distance and @xmath6 the scale factor , containing a tachyon field @xmath2 evolving according to the lagrangian @xmath17the energy density and pressure of the tachyon field for the friedmann background are : @xmath18we shall consider the model with the tachyonic potential @xcite : @xmath19where @xmath3 is a positive constant and @xmath20 .",
    "the dynamics of the tachyonic field is encompassed in the system : @xmath21@xmath22while gravitational dynamics is given by the friedmann equation @xmath23where the hubble variable @xmath7 is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "for a negative parameter @xmath1 , the evolution of the system ( [ system1])-([system2 ] ) is always characterized by @xmath25 the evolutions start from a big bang and the system has an attractive node at@xmath26which corresponds to a de sitter expansion with hubble parameter @xmath27 .",
    "( for more details see ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the case @xmath28 is much more richer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . the dynamical system ( [ system1])-([system2 ] )",
    "has three fixed points : the node ( crit ) and the two saddle points with coordinates @xmath29and , respectively , @xmath30which give rise to an unstable de sitter regime with hubble parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the most striking feature of the model under consideration with @xmath28 consists in the fact that now the cosmological trajectories are not confined to the rectangle given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34@xmath35are the limits of the domain for which the potential @xmath36 is well - defined .",
    "indeed , the curvature scalar@xmath37indicates curvature singularities at @xmath38 except when @xmath39 at the same time .",
    "this happens at the points @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where as the analysis of @xcite shows , there is no singularity and the trajectories can be continuated . in doing so , the potential should be redefined by multiplying with @xmath42 , so that it becomes real , @xmath43 .",
    "then in the energy density and pressure @xmath44 will absorb this @xmath42 , so that in the superluminal regimes we have @xmath45both positive .    in what follows",
    ", we briefly display all possible classes of cosmological evolutions existing in the tachyonic model with @xmath28 .",
    "first of all , note that in the phase space the reflections with respect to the node point @xmath46 leave the cosmological evolutions invariant .",
    "thus , it makes sense to study only half of the possible initial conditions in the rectangle .",
    "this rectangle in the phase space @xmath47 should be complemented by four infinite stripes ( see fig.1 ) . the left upper stripe ( the right lower stripe )",
    "corresponds to the initial stages of the cosmological evolution , while the right upper stripe ( and the left lower stripe ) corresponds to the final stages .",
    "there are five classes of qualitatively different cosmological trajectories . in characterizing them",
    ", we shall consider only half of the possible initial conditions taking into account the reflection symmetry mentioned above .",
    "( @xmath48).,height=226 ]    the trajectories of class iv begin in the left upper stripe in the point with coordinates @xmath49 , which corresponds to the singularity of the standard big bang type .",
    "these trajectories climb to some maximal value of @xmath5 , then turn down and cross the point @xmath50 , entering the rectangle . then they leave the rectangle through the point @xmath51 entering the left lower stripe . here , after a finite period of time the universe encounters a special type of cosmological singularity , which we call big brake . at this singularity ,",
    "the tachyon field has some finite value , its velocity @xmath5 tends to @xmath10 , the cosmological radius has a finite value , its first time derivative is equal to zero , while its second time derivative tends to @xmath10 .",
    "the trajectories of class i also begin in the point with coordinates @xmath49 , however , after entering the rectangle they end their evolution in the de sitter node .",
    "they are separated from the trajectories of class iv by the separatrix @xmath52 , which inside the rectangle connects the corner @xmath50 with the left saddle point .",
    "the trajectories of class ii are separated from those of class i by the curve @xmath11 , which begins in the point with coordinates @xmath53 , passes through the corner @xmath50 and ends in the de sitter node .",
    "these trajectories begin at the singularity @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and end in the de sitter node .",
    "the separatrix @xmath56 , ending in the right saddle , separates the trajectories of class ii from those of class iii .",
    "the latter , beginning at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , after crossing the corner @xmath60 encounter their big brake singularity in the upper right infinite stripe .",
    "these trajectories are separated from those of class iv by the curve @xmath61 , which passes through the right saddle point and the corner @xmath60 .",
    "finally , the trajectories of the last class v begin at @xmath62 and end in the big brake singularity .",
    "the time dependence of the hubble parameter for these five classes is represented in fig .",
    ".,height=226 ]    we conclude this section by giving some additional formulae characterizing the different types of singularities present in the cosmological model under consideration . in the vicinity of the singularity which takes place at the horizontal sides of the rectangle ( say , at @xmath63 ) , we have the following dependence of the function @xmath5 on @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 hence the energy density is @xmath66 in the vicinity of the singularity @xmath67 and @xmath68 while the hubble variable is @xmath69 just like in the dust - filled universe born in the vicinity of the big bang singularity .    for the universe born in the point @xmath70 the potential @xmath71 behaves as @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the energy density behaves as @xmath74 while the hubble variable is @xmath75 thus , one can note that the universe has at this point a big bang singularity and behaves in such a way as if it were filled with a perfect barotropic fluid with equation of state parameter @xmath76 .",
    "we can also describe the behavior of the universe in the vicinity of the final big brake singularity following the logic of paper @xcite .",
    "consider the universe which is approaching the big brake in the lower left stripe at some value of the tachyon field @xmath77 .",
    "correspondingly , the variable @xmath5 approaches @xmath78 . analyzing eq .",

    "now , using the formula ( friedmann1 ) and the energy density from ( [ en - new ] ) , one easily finds @xmath81 thus , we see that when @xmath82 , the hubble variable @xmath7 vanishes while its time derivative diverges , tending to @xmath78 .",
