    "gravitational collapse - the infall of a body under its own gravity - is of paramount importance in astrophysics . stars and galaxies grow from initially small perturbations of a uniform density medium , which is an unstable equilibrium solution of the newtonian equations of motion . upon the action of gravity , overdense regions attract the neighbouring material , accreting all mass within a certain radius of influence into a singular point .",
    "some of the gravitational energy , though , transforms into heat and/or random motions that oppose collapse . in most real - life situations ( black holes being the exception ) ,",
    "the ensuing pressure gradient is able to counteract the gravitational acceleration , and a non - singular equilibrium state is reached .",
    "mathematically , the evolution of a fluid with mass density @xmath4 and mean local velocity @xmath5 is described by the euler equations , that amount to the conservation of mass @xmath6 and momentum @xmath7 supplemented by the poisson equation @xmath8 that relates the gravitational potential @xmath9 to the density distribution of the fluid , where @xmath10 denotes the surface of a unit sphere in @xmath11 dimensions . in order to close the system ,",
    "the initial data in @xmath12 and @xmath13 at some arbitrary time @xmath14 have to be specified , as well as an ( effective ) barotropic equation of state to relate the gas density and pressure by a function @xmath15 or , equivalently , a sound speed @xmath16 where @xmath17 accounts for an isotropic pressure due to the internal random motions of the constituent particles of the fluid , and we will focus on the particular case of a constant sound speed , corresponding to an isothermal equation of state .",
    "the term @xmath18 in equation   corresponds to the average gas density , and it vanishes for any system with finite mass contained in an infinite space . here",
    ", we will consider the collapse of an initial perturbation ( e.g a protostar ) out of a gas cloud that is assumed to be roughly uniform on scales much larger than those relevant to the problem .",
    "such conditions may be realized by a periodic cubic box of sufficiently large size @xmath19 , i.e. a three - dimensional torus @xmath20 , as the spatial domain .",
    "in general , for a @xmath11-dimensional torus with periodicity @xmath19 , @xmath21 it is interesting to note that this average background density is often neglected in astrophysics , leading to the so - called ` jeans swindle ' in the analysis of the stability of an infinite medium @xcite .",
    "a deeper discussion of this issue and the validity of equation   is provided in  [ sec_jeans ] .",
    "we will also make the approximation , akin to darcy s law in earth sciences , that the acceleration term that appears in the momentum conservation equation is always proportional to the fluid velocity @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant with dimensions of time .",
    "physically , this relation arises if a strong friction force is present ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , it will also hold _ approximately _ during the earliest stages of the gravitational collapse of an initially homogeneous medium .",
    "this assumption greatly simplifies the problem , and it is arguably one of the key ingredients of the proposed model .",
    "its physical motivation and the relation to other , more traditional approaches , are discussed in  [ sec_darcy ] .    substituting this approximation in expression   and taking the divergence",
    ", one obtains @xmath24 which , using the continuity and poisson equations and writing the equation of state in terms of the sound speed , transforms into @xmath25 since @xmath26 is fully determined by @xmath12 , our model consists on a single , non - linear and non - local , partial differential equation that describes the evolution of the gas density . denoting the solution of @xmath27 by @xmath28 , defining @xmath29 , and choosing the units of time , length , and mass such that @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , respectively , we finally arrive at @xmath33    this equation is well known , and its mathematical properties have been widely studied in different physical contexts",
    ". it can be re - written as @xmath34 that bears obvious resemblances to the vorticity equation for the incompressible navier - stokes equations in two dimensions @xmath35 and it has been proposed by jger and luckhaus @xcite as a simplified version of the classical ( parabolic - elliptic ) patlak - keller - segel model @xcite of chemotaxis in biological systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ; a recent review of the results concerning this equation can be found in @xcite ) . the non - periodic ( bounded or otherwise ) case with @xmath36 , i.e.",
    "the so - called smoluchowski - poisson system , has been previously studied in the context of gravitational collapse by p. biler and co - workers in the mathematical literature ( where the problems of existence , conditions for blow - up , radial solutions , stationary solutions , and other qualitative properties have been addressed in @xcite ) , and by p.  h. chavanis and co - workers ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) in the physical literature . in particular , the stability of an infinite homogeneous medium with non - zero @xmath37  and the phase transitions between homogeneous and inhomogeneous states have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "l. corrias , b. perthame , and h. zaag have proven that , for small data in @xmath38 , there are global in time weak solutions to equation in @xmath39 , and blow - up can occur if the smallness condition does not hold ( see theorem 1.1 and 1.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the case of measure - valued weak solutions has been considered by t.senba and t.suzuki @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "equation   with @xmath40 would be a model for a perfectly collisionless fluid with negligible random motions ( e.g. cold dark matter ) , whereas @xmath41 corresponds to an isothermal ideal gas .",
    "however , the hydrodynamic approximation ( i.e. the euler equation ) may also describe a collisionless system , as long as it features an ( approximately ) isotropic velocity dispersion tensor @xcite . here",
    ", we would like to consider the generalized equation @xmath42 where the fractional laplacian @xmath43 is defined using fourier theory , @xmath44 as an alternative intermediate case that interpolates smoothly between cold dark matter and an ordinary fluid .",
    "physically , this is a non - local adhesion model . due to the non - local character of the diffusive operators @xmath45 ,",
    "the pressure forces now contain information about the total distribution of mass ; in other words , the pressure at a given point @xmath46 does not depend only on @xmath47 but on the overall distribution @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "such an equation may develop singularities in a finite time depending on the initial data .",
    "the case @xmath50 is critical in the sense that we have a conservative derivative ( the term @xmath51 ) and a _ ` dissipative ' _ one in the term @xmath52 . in the keller - segel community , the word ` critical ' usually refers to the case in which the scaling invariance of the pde matches that of the @xmath53 norm , which happens for @xmath54 in @xmath55 .    albeit its physical interpretation is not as straightforward as the smoluchowski - poisson or patlak - keller - segel models ,",
    "the non - local generalization has also received considerable attention during the past years ( e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , d. li , j. rodrigo and x. zhang @xcite have established local existence ( using the linear semigroup and duhamel s formula ) , as well as a continuation criterion derived by contradiction ( see our proposition [ singf ] ) and some results concerning blow - up in finite time ( proposition [ starf ] ) .",
    "global existence when the initial data is small in @xmath53 has been recently addressed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will show that , in such a case , @xmath3 may be bounded uniformly , and global existence is obtained as a corollary .",
    "we state all our results as a condition on the size of the pressure forces , @xmath56 ; our sufficient conditions for gravitational stability are closely related to the classical jeans criterion , @xmath57 @xcite , widely applied by the astrophysical community ( see  [ sec_jeans ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec_wellposed ] , we show that the problem is locally well posed ( forward in time ) in sobolev spaces ( theorem [ wellp ] ) and a _ beale - kato - majda_-type criterion involving @xmath2 ( proposition [ singf ] ) .",
    "these results were already known ( see e.g. theorems 1.1 and 1.4 in @xcite ) and are proved here by different techniques .",
    "we also present a result concerning the smoothing effect of our model ( theorem [ se ] ) , due to the linear part when @xmath41 , and prove that the problem is ill posed backward in time . although not unexpected , the smoothing effect is , to the best of our knowledge , a new result , and ill - posedness follows as a consequence of the instant analyticity property .",
    "the conditions for gravitational stability , i.e. the decay of small perturbations ( theorem  [ max1_d2 ] ) and fluctuations of arbitrary size ( theorem  [ max ] ) , are investigated in section  [ sec_infnorm ] .",
    "these results are briefly compared with the well - known critical mass phenomenon in higher dimensions .",
    "using proposition [ singf ] , these theorems imply global in time existence , which we are not aware that has ever been shown for equation   ( c.f .",
    "theorem  1.1 in  @xcite ) . a finite - time blow - up result for some initial data in a special class",
    "is proved in theorem  1.10 of  @xcite .",
    "these initial data are concentrated near the origin in terms of a parameter @xmath58 such that , for @xmath59 , the maximum of the initial datum grows , roughly speaking , like @xmath60 .",
    "here we also give a minimum time for blow - up which is the periodic version of theorem 1.9 in @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are presented in section  [ sec_sims ] .",
    "for the sake of mathematical consistency , we show in this section that equation is well posed if @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "first , let us note that the average density @xmath18 defined in equation is conserved during the evolution of the system , and thus it is a constant that only depends on the initial data by an adequate choice of units . ] .",
    "we state this claim in the following lemma :    let @xmath63 be a classical solution .",
    "then , the total mass is conserved @xmath64 and , as a consequence , @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "we observe that , using @xmath65 , the term @xmath66 now , integrating and using the divergence theorem the proof follows .    to prove the existence and uniqueness of classical solution , we proceed as in @xcite .",
    "we obtain some _ ` a priori ' _ ( _ i.e. _ assuming the existence of classical solution ) bounds for the usual norm in the space @xmath67 and then regularize equation so that all the regularized problems have a classical solution for a uniform time @xmath68 . to conclude , we use the _ ` a priori ' _ bound to show that the solutions to the regularized problem form a cauchy sequence whose limit is the solution to the original equation . in order to simplify the notation , we will abbreviate @xmath69 , or simply @xmath12 , throughout the rest of the paper .",

    "we give an alternative proof of a _ beale - kato - majda_-type criterion characterising the possible singularities ( see @xcite ) :    [ singf ] suppose that we have @xmath114 then the solution exists upon time @xmath115 for a sufficiently small @xmath116 .",

    "our proof follows the steps presented in @xcite .",

    "we define the _ ` energy ' _ @xmath191",
    "the evolution of this energy is @xmath192 at this point it is easy to obtain @xmath193 so @xmath194 and we conclude that there is a time @xmath195 so that @xmath196    now we approximate the problem in the real line as in the proof of the theorem [ wellp ] , using the rescaled heat kernel as a mollifier : @xmath197 where @xmath198 and we use @xmath199 as initial data . using picard s theorem in @xmath200 we obtain solutions @xmath95 up to time @xmath201 which are analytic . due to the above estimates we have a time a common time of existence @xmath23 depending on the initial data @xmath104 but not in @xmath96 and if @xmath202 , @xmath203 .",

    "the blow - up of the solutions in finite time is of particular interest from the physical point of view , since it determines whether a gravitationally bound structure may form or not . in order to investigate the necessary conditions for star formation , the present section is devoted to the evolution of @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , it is our goal to determine whether / when the growth of singularities can be avoided in our non - local adhesion model .",

    "all our results are expressed in units such as @xmath228 ; the conversion to other systems can be trivially carried out by substituting every occurrence of @xmath12 by @xmath229 or , alternatively , @xmath56 by @xmath230 .",
    "first of all , let us address the minimum time required for the gravitational collapse of a protostar .",
    "for those cases where a star is formed ( i.e. @xmath231 , see e.g. figure  [ blo ] ) , we provide a lower bound for the value of @xmath232 as a function of the initial condition .",

    "then we have @xmath235 thus @xmath236 as a consequence the minimum time for the formation of a star is @xmath237    due to the smoothness of @xmath12 and using rademacher theorem , we have that the evolution of @xmath238 is given by @xmath239 where the last inequality is due to the integral representation for the diffusive operator .",
    "now the result is straightforward .      our main result , and",
    "the one that bears more physical relevance , is that equation with @xmath50 does not have a blow - up for @xmath3  i.e. no star can ever form  if @xmath56 is big enough .",

    "there are , however , important differences when this is not the case , and we would like to advocate the use of equation   in order to describe an infinite system .",

    "if @xmath332 and the extra term was not included , the poisson equation could never be solved for a periodic system .",
    "the pioneering analysis @xcite by sir james h. jeans at the beginning of the past century was the first attempt to address the stability of an initially uniform gas cloud at a given temperature @xmath68 and density @xmath104  _ assumed _ to be in equilibrium  against the growth of arbitrarily small perturbations .",
    "the assumption of initial equilibrium is inconsistent with the poisson equation when the @xmath37  term is neglected can be found , where the cosmic scale factor @xmath333 is exactly the same as in a fully relativistic lematre - friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the analogy between newtonian and relativistic dynamics can be trivially extended to a spherically - symmetric tolman - bondi universe with cosmological constant .",
    "the effect of the @xmath37  term is indeed so similar to a constant ` vacuum energy density ' that it is tempting to associate them .",
    "some claims have already been made in this direction @xcite , and many studies attempt to accommodate current observational data on the accelerated expansion of the universe in terms of inhomogeneous models without a dark energy component ( see e.g @xcite for a recent review ) . ] , and is often referred to in the astrophysical literature as the ` jeans swindle ' ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , several recent works @xcite vindicate its validity using a variety of arguments , and we would like to claim that the reasoning above supports their main conclusions . in particular , we claim that the law of gravity should be such that an infinite fluid with constant density is an ( unstable ) static equilibrium solution , where the net force felt by every point , averaged over such a homogeneous and isotropic background , vanishes .    by linearizing the hydrodynamic equations and decomposing the perturbations in fourier modes ,",

    "@xmath337 will thus oscillate as as acoustic waves , whereas any disturbance on larger scales will be exponentially amplified .",
    "recalling that @xmath338 , jeans result would be expressed in the notation of the present paper by saying that a uniform gas cloud with @xmath339 is linearly unstable . for larger values of @xmath56 ,",
    "pressure forces are more important in relation to gravity , and _ small _ perturbations , i.e. @xmath340 , do not grow .",
    "however , this criterion has an important shortcoming : nothing can be said about the evolution of the system when @xmath341 .",
    "an equivalent result for equation   would be the following :    [ th_jeans ] given the linearized version of equation   with @xmath1 , small perturbations of the homogeneous state , @xmath342 with @xmath343 and @xmath344 , are unstable if @xmath339 , and they are damped if @xmath345 .    from the linearized version of equation   @xmath346 the proof follows by taking the fourier transform",
    ".    an analogous result for equation   has been derived by @xcite . the condition for linear",
    "( in)stability is indeed the same for the three sets of equations . in the fully non - linear regime ,",
    "theorem  [ max1_d2 ] proves stability against perturbations of magnitude @xmath347 ( above such threshold , theorem 1.10 of @xcite may apply ) . for @xmath117 , gravitational collapse can not occur at all if @xmath261 o @xmath50 and @xmath348 ( theorem  [ max ] ) , the latter condition being equivalent to @xmath285 ( see remark in section  [ th_l1norm ] ) .",
    "as shown in the introduction , the approximation   that the velocity is proportional to the acceleration leads immediately to equation  . here",
    "we would like to justify the validity of such approximation and discuss the main similarities and differences with respect to the original problem , as well as other , more traditional approaches .    first , let us note that the family of hydrostatic equilibrium solutions of the full problem , @xmath349 are also equilibrium solutions of our approximation , since , taking the divergence of the above expression , @xmath350    one of these equilibrium solutions is the homogeneous state @xmath351 that we take as a starting point in the present work .",
    "if we now perturb a ` spherical ' region of radius @xmath352 and mass @xmath353 by a small displacement @xmath354 $ ] with @xmath355 for all @xmath352 , and the perturbed density decreases monotonically with radius , the different spherical shells will not cross during the collapse phase , and the enclosed mass @xmath356 will be conserved for every shell . applying gauss theorem to equation  , their evolution will be given by @xmath357 and therefore , neglecting pressure forces ( by imposing that the initial displacement @xmath96 is sufficiently smooth ) , @xmath358 = \\frac { g s_d\\,{\\ensuremath { \\langle\\rho\\rangle } } } { d } \\left [ 1- \\frac{1}{(1+\\epsilon)^d } \\right].\\ ] ] to first order , @xmath359 , and we recover expression   with a characteristic dynamical time @xmath360    the ` darcy approximation ' consists in assuming that this relation , strictly valid close to equilibrium , holds at all times .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , the main difference between the euler - poisson and the smoluchowski / patlak - keller - segel model is that , in the latter , perturbations below the jeans length do not oscillate as sound waves but are exponentially damped .",
    "the extrapolation of equation   beyond the linear regime is very similar in spirit ( though not exactly equivalent ) to the zeldovich approximation @xcite used in cosmology to study the formation of large - scale structure in the primordial universe . in this approximation , particles move along straight trajectories of the form @xmath361 where @xmath362 denotes the actual ( eulerian ) position of the particle , @xmath363 is its lagrangian coordinate , the factor @xmath333 accounts for cosmic expansion , and the vector function @xmath364 is determined by the initial conditions .",
    "the evolution of the inhomogeneities is given by the growth factor @xmath365 , chosen to match the results of eulerian linear theory .",
    "for an einstein - desitter cosmology , which always provides a valid approximation for a matter - dominated universe at early times , @xmath366 , @xmath367 , and @xmath368 .",
    "working in comoving coordinates , @xmath369 , one obtains @xmath370 analogously to equation  , although in this case @xmath18 depends on time due to the expansion of space ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the cosmological implications of the parallelism between peculiar velocities and accelerations ) .",
    "again , the most important difference with respect to the euler equation is that   is dissipative .",
    "however , we would like to note that , in order to prevent caustic formation and shell - crossing in the zeldovich approximation , a small dissipative viscosity is introduced , leading to the so - called adhesion model @xcite . from a microphysical point of view",
    ", this viscosity may arise from random noise in the trajectories of the particles .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that equation   can be obtained for a gas of self - gravitating brownian particles in the mean field limit with strong friction . along these lines ,",
