    "+ our motivation for this work is the application to the existence of `` flow barriers '' in two dimensional , incompressible , time - dependent fluid flows . over the past 10 years",
    "there has been much work in applying the approach and methods of dynamical systems theory to the study of transport in fluids from the lagrangian point of view .",
    "suppose one is interested in the motion of a _ passive tracer _ in a fluid ( e.g. dye , temperature , or any material that can be considered as having negligible effect on the flow ) , then , _ neglecting molecular diffusion _ , the passive tracer follows fluid particle trajectories which are solutions of    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the velocity field of the fluid flow , @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "when viewed from the point of view of dynamical systems theory , the phase space of ( [ eq : u ] ) is actually the physical space in which the fluid flow takes place . evidently ,",
    " structures \" in the phase space of ( [ eq : u ] ) should have some influence on the transport and mixing properties of the fluid .",
    "babiano @xmath15 and aref and el naschie @xmath16 provide recent reviews of this approach .    to make the connection with the large body of literature on dynamical systems theory more concrete",
    "let us consider a less general fluid mechanical setting .",
    "suppose that the fluid is two - dimensional , incompressible , and inviscid .",
    "then we know that the velocity field can be obtained from the derivatives of a scalar valued function , @xmath17 , known as the _ streamfunction _ , as follows    @xmath18    in the context of dynamical systems theory , ( [ vel2 ] ) is a time - dependent hamiltonian vector field where the streamfunction plays the role of the hamiltonian function .",
    "if the flow is time - periodic then the study of ( [ vel2 ] ) is typically reduced to the study of a two - dimensional area preserving _",
    "poincar map_. practically speaking , the reduction to a poincar map means that rather than viewing a particle trajectory as a curve in continuous time , one views the trajectory only at discrete intervals of time , where the interval of time is the period of the velocity field .",
    "the value of making this analogy with hamiltonian dynamical systems lies in the fact that a variety of techniques in this area have immediate applications to , and implications for , transport and mixing processes in fluid mechanics .",
    "for example , the persistence of invariant curves in the poincar map ( kam curves ) gives rise to barriers to transport , chaos and smale horseshoes provide mechanisms for the `` randomization '' of fluid particle trajectories , an analytical technique , melnikov s method , allows one to estimate fluxes as well as describe the parameter regimes where chaotic fluid particle motions occur , a relatively new technique , lobe dynamics , enables one to efficiently compute transport between qualitatively different flow regimes .",
    "extending the constructions of smale horseshoes , melnikov s method , and stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic trajectories to vector fields with aperiodic time - dependence has been done .",
    "however , extensions of kam theory to vector fields with arbitrary time - dependence has not been done .",
    "this paper represents a first step in that direction .",
    "one of the main stability results for nearly - integrable hamiltonian systems is kolmogorov s theorem @xmath19 concerning the preservation of a set of full - measure - nonresonant invariant tori .",
    "such nearly - integrable hamiltonian systems are generated by a real valued hamiltonian written in action - angle variables @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are , respectively , the action and angle variables , and @xmath23 is a small perturbation parameter .",
    "@xmath24 is therefore a small perturbation of the integrable hamiltonian @xmath25 . for any @xmath26",
    "the unperturbed angular frequencies are defined by @xmath27 . for the integrable hamiltonian",
    "@xmath25 the equations of motion reduce to @xmath28 with solutions @xmath29 .",
    "consequently the phase space is foliated by invariant @xmath30-tori with quasi - periodic motions characterized by the frequency @xmath31 .",
    "the result of adding a small perturbation to the integrable hamiltonian @xmath25 is the destruction of all tori except for those whose frequencies satisfy a non - resonance condition .    in the kam theorem attention",
    "is restricted to tori supporting quasi - periodic motions with an appropriate nonresonant condition . given the set of all frequencies @xmath32 , the frequencies satisfying this nonresonant condition are called diaphontine frequencies and as a subset of @xmath33 are defined by @xmath34 for some positive constant @xmath35 .",
    "the method used to prove the kam theorem in @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which this paper follows , is standard in classical perturbation theory .",
    "the central idea is to construct a suitable canonical transformation @xmath38 which brings the original hamiltonian @xmath10 into a normal form which depends on fewer angles , none if possible .",
    "the transformation @xmath38 is constructed iteratively as the composition of successive near - identity canonical transformations @xmath39 . taking the limit as the number of iterative steps goes to infinity results in the elimination of the perturbation of the hamiltonian leaving an integrable system that is isomorphic to the original system . to construct this canonical transformation",
    "the authors in @xmath36 and @xmath37 make use of the lie series method which has the advantage of avoiding any inversion and thus any reference to the implicit - function theorem .",
    "the lie series method requires constructing a hamiltonian called the generating function . at the @xmath40th step of the iterative process",
    "a generating function @xmath41 is constructed and the desired near - identity canonical transformation @xmath42 is obtained as the flow at time @xmath43 associated with such generating function . the generating function is constructed via the nondegeneracy condition and by solving a partial differential equation .    the restriction to diophantine tori comes about from the problem of solving the partial differential equation mentioned above which has the form @xmath44 where the unknown function @xmath45 and the known function @xmath46 are defined on the torus @xmath47 and @xmath46 has zero average .    in this paper",
    "we consider two similar kam theorems where , in each , there is an aperiodic time dependent term in the perturbation . in both cases",
    "we consider an n - degree of freedom real valued nearly - integrable hamiltonian in action - angle variables of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath22 , @xmath50 and @xmath3 is a small perturbation parameter . in the first case",
    "the perturbation considered has an exponentially decaying aperiodic time dependent term and a quasiperiodic term depending only on the angles @xmath5 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a bounded function and @xmath53 decays exponentially .",
    "the nature of this exponential decay is explained fully in the next section , ( see definition 1 ) . in the second case",
    "the perturbation consists of an exponentially decaying aperiodic time dependent term and a term depending in a quasiperiodic manner on the angles @xmath5 and on time @xmath6 @xmath54 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 are as above and @xmath55 is the vector of basic frequencies .",
    "although the second case seems more promising as far as applications is concern , we first prove the less technical first case . in the last section we sketch the proof of the time quasiperiodic case and state the theorem .",
    "the only difference in the assumptions of the time quasiperiodic theorem involves the diophantine condition @xmath56 which must hold for the larger vector @xmath57 rather than just the vector @xmath58 .",
    "in both cases we consider the nearly - integrable system generated by the hamiltonian @xmath59 and prove a kam type theorem where instead of tori we show the preservation of cylinders of the form @xmath60 .",
    "the proof is similar in method to the one given in @xmath36 .",
    "first , the non - autonomous vector field is made autonomous by making time a dependent variable , @xmath61 , and grouping it with the angles .",
    "similarly a conjugate variable @xmath62 is grouped with the action variables .",
    "we write the hamiltonian in a kolmogorov - type normal form , which consists of taylor expanding the hamiltonian about @xmath63 and grouping terms of different orders of magnitude .",
    "note the proof of this theorem focuses on the preservation of the cylinder with @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "this can be done without loss of generality since any other cylinder can be shifted to the `` zero '' cylinder .",
    "once the hamiltonian is in kolmogorov normal form we seek a suitable canonical transformation which brings the hamiltonian into a normal form which depends on fewer angles .",
    "the transformation is constructed iteratively as the product of near identity canonical transformations @xmath66 ; i.e @xmath67 .",
    "the result is a sequence of hamiltonians , @xmath68 , which come closer to the desired normal form . letting @xmath69",
    ", we obtain @xmath70 which is an integrable hamiltonian .",
    "the sequence of canonical transformations is obtained using the lie series method . this method and other techniques from the theory of several complex variables",
    "will require us to extend the domain of our real valued functions and consider analytic functions defined on a complex domain .    to carry out the lie series method we introduce a generating function of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 . to solve for @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "we must solve a partial differential equation of the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , the given function @xmath79 with zero average and the unknown function @xmath80 are defined on @xmath81 .",
    "the known function @xmath79 will be an expression related to the perturbation and the unknown function @xmath80 will be an expression related to @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "for the time independent case with functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 defined on @xmath47 the partial differential equation can be solved in terms of fourier coefficients @xmath36 .",
    "understandably though , the aperiodic nature of the time dependence renders the fourier series procedure inapplicable to the problem at hand .",
    "instead we must use fourier transform methods to solve for @xmath82 and @xmath83 and obtain the appropriate domains of analyticity .",
    "consequently @xmath80 is written as a fourier series with time dependent fourier coefficients @xmath86 and these coefficients are expressed in terms of the fourier transform of the time dependent fourier coefficients of @xmath79 .",
    "solving @xmath87 for the unknown function @xmath80 restricts the form of the time dependent perturbation requiring an exponential decay in time in order to obtain convergence of the fourier coefficients @xmath86 .    to obtain a value for @xmath88 and",
    "completely solve for the generating function we make use of the nondegeneracy assumption @xmath89 .",
    "note this assumption implies the frequencies are functionally independent and since @xmath78 , the ratios of the frequencies @xmath90 to @xmath91 are functionally independent as well .",
    "thus we obtain what is called an isoenergetic nondegeneracy condition .",
    "this condition is the key feature in solving for @xmath88 .    after applying the iterative lemma @xmath30 times and taking @xmath92",
    "we obtain an integrable hamiltonian @xmath93 in the transformed variables @xmath94 which generates an autonomous vector field in @xmath95 with solutions of the form @xmath96 .",
    "these solutions imply the phase space @xmath97 is foliated by invariant infinite cylinders each sustaining winding motions identified by the frequency @xmath98 and evolving in the @xmath99 direction .    in appendix",
    "@xmath100 we present the rossby wave flow @xmath101 with a time decaying perturbation and show this system satisfies the hypothesis of the theorem presented in this paper .",
    "although we begin by considering a real hamiltonian dynamical system , techniques from several complex variables will be use in the analysis .",
    "this requires complex extensions of the original functions defined in @xmath102 to functions defined in @xmath103 .",
    "we begin describing these complex extensions with some notation .",
