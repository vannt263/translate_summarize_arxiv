    "in the last couple of decades , several interesting identities had been derived by various authors for hyperbolic manifolds and surfaces , notably , those of basmajian @xcite , mcshane @xcite , bridgeman @xcite , bridgeman and kahn @xcite and luo and tan @xcite . for a survey of the identities , generalizations and their connections , see bridgeman and tan @xcite and also @xcite . for hyperbolic surfaces ,",
    "the identities derived were for surfaces with geodesic boundary and/or cusps , except for the luo - tan identity which works for surfaces with or without boundary . however , the identity derived by luo - tan was trivial in the case of hyperbolic one - holed tori as in this case , there was only one embedded simple surface , namely the surface itself .",
    "this contrasts for example with mcshane s identity which was first proved for hyperbolic tori with one cusp by mcshane in his thesis @xcite and involves a non - trivial sum over the lengths of all simple closed geodesics , and subsequently generalized by mirzakhani for hyperbolic tori @xmath1 with one geodesic boundary ( more generally hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic boundary ) in @xcite , and tan , wong and zhang for hyperbolic tori with one cone singularity ( more generally hyperbolic surfaces with cone singularities of cone angle @xmath2 ) in @xcite , and more generally for @xmath3 characters of @xmath4 satisfying bowditch s q - conditions in @xcite .    the main aim of this paper is to derive a non - trivial version of the luo - tan identity for hyperbolic tori with one geodesic boundary or cusp , and as a corollary , to express the luo - tan identity for closed hyperbolic surfaces as a sum over all immersed geometric three - holed spheres @xmath0 in the surface which are embeddings when restricted to the interior of @xmath0 .",
    "the basic idea is to exploit the close connection between four - holed spheres and one - holed tori , and to use the non - trivial luo - tan identity for hyperbolic four - holed spheres with four geodesic boundaries of equal lengths to obtain a corresponding identity for the one - holed tori . an earlier version of the results here form part of the thesis of the first author @xcite .",

    "thus , a quasi - embedded geometric three - holed sphere is contained in a unique embedded geometric one - holed torus , and conversely , every embedded geometric one - holed torus together with a non - peripheral simple closed geodesic on the torus determines a quasi - embedded geometric three - holed sphere .",
