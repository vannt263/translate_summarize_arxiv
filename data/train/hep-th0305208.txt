    "the idea of supplementing our spacetime by compact extra dimensions has recently triggered a vast amount of research .",
    "the suggestion that the inverse radius of these extra dimensions does not have to be of planck - scale order but might even range down to tev scales has been inspiring and provided us with new machinery for tackling the open problems of the standard model and its extensions .",
    "extra dimensions have at least taught us to consider these problems from another viewpoint @xcite .",
    "compact extra dimensions receive strong motivation from string theory , where they appear in abundance . in this context",
    ", extra - dimensional field theories are regarded only as effective theories with a limited energy range of validity .",
    "problems of defining extra - dimensional models as fundamental quantum field theories do not occur from this point of view .",
    "however , since a convincing and unambiguous derivation of extra - dimensional extensions of the standard model from string theory is not in sight , the important question remains as to whether extra - dimensional models may exist as fundamental quantum field theories .",
    "so far , this question has not been answered in the affirmative .",
    "the price to be paid for any deviation from the critical dimension @xmath6 towards extra dimensions is the impossibility of renormalizing such theories within perturbation theory .",
    "this `` perturbative nonrenormalizability '' is usually taken as a strong hint that the quantum fields of these theories can not be fundamental as well as interacting . in technical terms",
    ", one expects that shifting the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff to infinity yields a zero renormalized coupling ( triviality ) .",
    "nevertheless , perturbative nonrenormalizability does not constitute a `` no - go '' theorem . despite this tarnish , theories can be fundamental and mathematically consistent down to arbitrarily small length scales , as proposed in weinberg s `` asymptotic safety '' scenario @xcite .",
    "it assumes the existence of a non - gauian ( = nonzero ) uv fixed point under the renormalization group ( rg ) operation at which the continuum limit can be taken .",
    "the theory is `` nonperturbatively renormalizable '' in wilson s sense .",
    "if the non - gauian fixed point is uv attractive for finitely many couplings in the action , the rg trajectories along which the theory can flow as we send the cutoff to infinity are labeled by only a finite number of physical parameters .",
    "then the theory is as predictive as any perturbatively renormalizable theory , and high - energy physics can be well separated from low - energy physics without tuning ( infinitely ) many parameters .",
    "indeed , there are a number of well - established examples of theories which are perturbatively nonrenormalizable but nonperturbatively renormalizable , such as the nonlinear sigma model in @xmath7 and models with four - fermion interactions in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "quantum gravity in @xmath8 belongs to this class , and recently , evidence has been collected for a non - gauian uv fixed point even in four - dimensional gravity @xcite .    in this work , we study the renormalizability status of gauge theories beyond four dimensions , since they are the crucial element for particle - physics models in extra dimensions .",
    "we also confine ourselves to nonsupersymmetric theories in order to avoid an abundant particle content beyond that of the standard model . for an su(@xmath3 )",
    "gauge theory , the classical action is given by @xmath9 where , for @xmath0 , the bare coupling @xmath10 has negative mass dimension @xmath11=(4-d)/2 $ ] . though the details of compactification of the extra dimensions constitute the properties of the four - dimensional low - energy theory , they are irrelevant for the far uv behavior ; the short - distance fluctuations simply do not `` see '' the compactness of the extra dimensions .",
    "hence , a suitable compactification is implicitly assumed in the following , while its effects on the uv behavior can be safely neglected .",
    "we will comment on rg effects at and above the compactification scale at the end of this work .",
    "in fact , it was noted long ago @xcite that the dimensionless rescaled gauge coupling , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes an rg momentum scale , exhibits a non - gauian uv fixed point for su(@xmath3 ) gauge theories in an @xmath14 expansion , @xmath15 where @xmath16 has to be assumed . the uv fixed point of the coupling , being a zero of the @xmath17 function with negative slope , can be found at @xmath18 , see fig .",
    "[ figeps ] .",
    "the existence of the uv fixed point is a simple consequence of the purely dimensional running , implying a positive term @xmath19 , and asymptotic freedom in four dimensions , i.e. , a negative term @xmath20 .",

    "the continuum limit can be taken , yielding a renormalized theory .",
    "the dimensionful renormalized coupling is asymptotically free , @xmath21 for increasing momentum scale @xmath13 , and the static quark potential becomes proportional to @xmath22 , independent of the dimensionality @xcite .",
    "obviously , these results are not trustworthy for five dimensions , with @xmath23 , and beyond , where the fixed - point coupling is large .",
    "the lesson to be learned is that the question of renormalizability of extra - dimensional gauge theories is nonperturbative in nature , and perturbative power - counting arguments are simply useless . to answer this question ,",
    "a number of lattice studies have been performed in @xmath24 @xcite , but no real evidence for a non - gauian fixed point has been found ( we will comment on these studies in more detail below ) .",
    "this puts the relevance of the @xmath14 expansion for @xmath25 even more into question .",
    "incidentally , the uv fixed points which are discussed in the context of `` gut precursors '' @xcite are the direct analogue of the uv fixed point of the @xmath14 expansion with the contribution of the extra - dimensional modes taken into account ( here the rg scale @xmath13 is related to the number of kaluza - klein modes contributing to the flow ) .",
    "it has been argued that the perturbative expansion parameter @xmath26 can be small even at the fixed point if the gauge group is sufficiently large .",
    "this would justify the use of perturbation theory and consequently the existence of the fixed point .",
    "however , as a caveat , let us remark that the smallness of the expansion parameter is not sufficient for perturbativity .",
    "for instance , the anomalous dimension at the non - gauian fixed point will always be large ( cf .",
    "below ) , independent of the smallness of the fixed - point value itself .",
    "such large anomalous dimensions have a strong influence on , e.g. , the form of the effective gluon propagator @xcite .    in section [ flow ] , we perform a nonperturbative analysis of the rg flow of gauge theories in @xmath0 without the need of small @xmath14 or @xmath27 . but even without this quantitative tool ,",
    "a qualitative scenario can be developed which relies on a few physical prerequisites . as is apparent from the @xmath14 expansion eq .",

    ", the first @xmath17 function coefficients are not universal in @xmath0 , but depend on the regularization scheme . instead , a universal object is , e.g. , the `` critical exponent '' @xmath33 . in the @xmath14 expansion ,",
    "the nonuniversal terms appear at order @xmath34 and are not displayed in eq .",
    "( [ epsexp ] ) .",
    "as we will show below within the exact rg framework , the statement @xmath31 holds , independent of the regulator . ] [ foot1 ] from this , we deduce that a non - gauian uv fixed point exists if @xmath35 for some @xmath36 .",
    "for instance , such a fixed point always exists if @xmath29 is unbounded from below , as is the case to lowest order in the @xmath14 expansion .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath29 is a smooth function of @xmath32 , such that its functional form remains qualitatively similar to @xmath37 at least for a small number of extra dimensions ( this will indeed be a result of our calculation in sect .  [ flow ] ) .",
    "as an analogue , one may think of dimensionally regularized amplitudes with divergencies already subtracted but with full dependence on @xmath32 retained . as a first guess",
    ", it is tempting to conjecture that a uv fixed point always exists in this case .",
    "this is because in @xmath6 , the gauge coupling is frequently expected to diverge in the infrared at a `` confinement scale '' .",
    "this would be a natural consequence of @xmath37 being unbounded from below with similar implications for @xmath0 .    however , the situation is more subtle because of the inherent dependence of the running coupling on its nonperturbative definition . here , we are interested in the uv behavior of gauge - invariant operators that are building blocks of the effective action , and we expect possible non - gauian fixed points to be related to low - dimensional operators .",
    "hence , we have to look at the running of those couplings which are prefactors of whole operators such as , e.g. , @xmath38 ; by contrast , the running coupling defined , e.g. , by the three - gluon vertex at various momenta would be useless , because infinitely many ( derivative ) operators can contribute to such a coupling .",
    "an expansion in terms of low - dimensional operators suggests the study of a wilsonian effective action ( within a gauge - invariant formalism , as used below , ) of the form @xmath39 where @xmath13 is the scale at which we consider the theory with all fluctuations with momenta @xmath40 already integrated out ; the dependence of the wave function renormalization @xmath41 and the generalized couplings @xmath42 on @xmath13 has been displayed explicitly .",
    "a useful definition of the dimensionless running gauge coupling now is @xmath43 such that a non - gauian uv fixed point in @xmath27 corresponds to a renormalizable operator @xmath44 .",
    "further uv fixed points may exist in other couplings corresponding to further renormalizable operators which then form the uv critical surface @xmath45 of rg trajectories hitting the uv fixed point as we send the cutoff to infinity , @xmath46 .",
    "the running of the couplings depend also on the regularization . working with the exact renormalization group",
    ", we will use a regulator that acts as a mass term for modes with momenta smaller than @xmath13 but vanishes for the high - momentum modes larger than @xmath13 . studying the flow of couplings with respect to a variation of @xmath13",
    "allows to probe the quantum system at different momentum scales .",
    "the exact rg hence provides for a natural setting to address the question of renormalizability , i.e. , the behavior of the couplings for @xmath46 .",
    "the regularization technique is particularly advantageous for the description of decoupling of massive modes . for a given rg cutoff scale @xmath13 , only particles with masses",

    ", quantitative improvements are expected from additional low - dimensional operators such as those displayed in eq .",
    "( [ dimexp ] ) . by analogy to the ( @xmath32=4)-dimensional case , one may argue that such additional operators contribute positively to the fluctuation part of the @xmath17 function , decreasing the value of @xmath59 .",

    "this conclusion is compatible with ( most of the ) lattice simulations available for @xmath24 : in @xcite , extra - dimensional lattice gauge systems were found to have a weak - coupling `` spin - wave '' and a strong - coupling `` confinement '' phase separated by a first - order phase transition .",
    "the latter does not allow for a continuum limit that would give rise to a renormalizable quantum field theory.=5)-dimensional yang - mills theory with compactified extra dimension was found , provided that the compactification radius was small enough .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the asymmetric lattices in those works correspond to @xmath112 `` extra - dimensional '' lattice sites on symmetric lattices . therefore , the continuum limit investigated in @xcite seems to resemble the `` deconstruction '' models @xcite rather than continuum extra - dimensional models .",
    "moreover , it would be hard to understand why a compact , but still rather `` macroscopical '' size of the fifth dimension should modify the behavior of the theory in the deep uv . ]    in contrast to the conservative viewpoint , there is yet another alternative explanation for our observation of a non - gauian fixed point in @xmath113 .",
    "it may be that this fixed point for the running coupling reflects only a one - dimensional projection of a higher - dimensional critical surface @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , there might be a true non - gauian fixed point with a larger number @xmath114 of non - gauian uv attractive components corresponding to a number of @xmath114 rg `` relevant '' operators .",
    "since our calculation also involves higher - order operators @xmath115 , our truncation could be sensitive to the influence of these operators stabilizing the uv fixed point of the coupling .",

    "if the wilson action is not in the domain of attractivity of the true fixed point , i.e. , in the same universality class as the renormalizable action , the line of `` constant physics '' towards the continuum limit will not be visible on the lattice .",
    "if this second alternative turned out to be true , a purely field theoretic fundamental and renormalizable extra - dimensional model could be constructed , but a larger number of @xmath114 physical parameters would have to be fixed for the model to be predictive . for a detailed investigation of this issue , a systematic inclusion of all low - dimensional operators such as those displayed in eq .",

    "although this `` freezes '' the coupling at the intermediate scales , it does not help to separate the compactification scale far from the scale of new physics in the nonrenormalizable case , since the uv fixed point vanishes as soon as @xmath127 , and the coupling will generally grow quickly . as a consequence , this line of argument may serve to exclude extra - dimensional models with perturbative gauge - coupling unification at a high scale @xmath128gev , but low - scale extra dimensions separated by many orders of magnitude , @xmath129 .",
