    "symbiotic stars are spectroscopically characterized by prominent emission lines with tio absorption bands that are typical of a giant .",
    "they are generally known to be wide binary systems consisting of a hot white dwarf and a giant star ( e.g. kenyon 1986 ) .",
    "they are usually divided into s and d type symbiotic stars , where d type systems exhibit infrared excess indicative of warm dust with temperature @xmath10 .",
    "many d type symbiotic stars are believed to contain a mira type giant as cool component .",
    "their orbital separation of the hot and cool components may lie in the range of 10 - 100 au , from which we expect the orbital periods of order @xmath11 ( whitelock 1987 ) .",
    "the giant component may lose mass in the form of slow stellar wind , a significant fraction of which can be photoionized by the hot white dwarf component .",
    "taylor & seaquist ( 1984 ) investigated the ionization structures in order to interpret their radio observations of symbiotic stars .",
    "many prominent emission lines in symbiotic stars can be excellent diagnostic tools to study the physical conditions around the white dwarf component ( e.g. mrset et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "it has been proposed by a number of researchers that some fraction of wind material from the giant component may be gravitationally captured by the hot component ( e.g. sokoloski bildsten & ho 2001 ) .",
    "the mass loss rate from the giant component may range from @xmath12 depending on the stellar evolution stage ( e.g. iben & tutukov 1996 , luthardt 1992 ) .",
    "wind accretion in binary star systems was investigated using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) by theuns and jorrissen ( 1993 ) , who concluded that an accretion dis can be formed in their isothermal flow models .",
    "mastrodemos & morris ( 1998 ) also adopted an sph method to show that an accretion disk can be formed around the white dwarf component .",
    "there are only limited studies about the existence of accretion disks and the insufficient numerical resolution prevents one from deducing the physical properties of an accretion disk in symbiotic stars .",
    "symbiotic stars being considered as a candidate for type ia supernova progenitors , the mass transfer process in symbiotic stars can also be a very important subject in other branches of astronomy .    about a half of symbiotic stars are known to exhibit very broad and mysterious emission features around 6825   and 7088   that were suspected to originate from highly ionized species ( allen 1980 ) .",
    "these features were finally identified by schmid ( 1989 ) , who proposed the raman scattering origin . according to him ,",
    "the raman scattering process starts with an o  vi 1032 line photon incident upon a hydrogen atom in the ground state , which can be converted into an optical 6825 photon as a result of an inelastic scattering off the hydrogen atom that is left in its excited @xmath13 state . from an incident o  vi 1038 line photon",
    ", we obtain a raman photon at around 7088 ",
    ". the raman scattering nature of these features is strongly supported by many observational studies including spectropolarimetric observations by harries & howarth ( 1996 ) and contemporaneous uv and optical observations by birriel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the wavelength @xmath14 of the inelastically scattered radiation is related with the incident wavelength @xmath15 and @xmath16 of hydrogen ly@xmath17 by @xmath18 differentiation of this equation leads to @xmath19    in the case of raman scattering involving o  vi 1032 , @xmath20 .",
    "this provides two important characteristics in the profiles of raman scattered o  vi 6825 that they are broader than their parent emission lines by a factor of @xmath21 and that they are mainly determined by the relative motion between the neutral scatterers and line photon emitters .",
    "therefore , the profiles are little affected by the direction of the observer s line of sight .",
    "this is due to the inelasticity of raman scattering and noted to be one of the most important spectroscopic properties retained by raman scattered features ( e.g. nussbaumer , schmid & vogel 1989 , schmid 1989 ) . in this respect ,",

    "raman scattered lines are found for o  vi 1032 , 1038 resonance doublets and he ii emission lines near h  i lyman series in many symbiotic stars and in a few young planetary nebulae ( e.g. van groningen 1993 , pquignot et al .",

    "furthermore , raman scattered features consist of purely scattered photons , not mixed with the direct emission , which makes them characterized by strong linear polarization .",
    "fairly intensive spectropolarimetric studies of raman scattered o  vi lines were carried out by harries & howarth ( 1996 ) .",
    "they found that the raman scattered o  vi 6825 and 7088 show double or triple peak profiles and that they are strongly polarized with complicated structures .",
    "schmid ( 1996 ) used a monte carlo method to calculate the profiles and polarization of these scattered features formed in a slowly expanding neutral region that mimics the stellar wind around the giant component .",
    "a similar study with a slightly different velocity law of the slow stellar wind was performed by lee & lee ( 1997b ) .    in these studies ,",
    "no kinematic structure is assumed for the emission region , which is treated effectively as point - like without any complicated internal structures . instead , the stronger red part of raman scattered o  vi 6825",
    "is mainly attributed to scattering at the receding part of the giant stellar wind that has a bigger geometric covering of the o  vi emission region than the approaching part does . however , in these models , one has to invoke a rather high velocity scale @xmath22 of the stellar wind from the giant in order to explain the observed raman profiles .",
    "lee & park ( 1999 ) adopted an accretion disk emission model and proposed the origin of the multiple peak profiles with strong linear polarization . in their picture",
    ", the accretion flow can be affected significantly by the binary orbital motion , which results in an asymmetric matter distribution around the white dwarf causing the stronger red part of the raman features . however , their study lacked detailed calculations that can be directly compared with the observed profiles .",
    "both v1016  cyg and hm  sge are classified as symbiotic novae or slow novae .",
    "v1016  cyg underwent a slow nova - like outburst in 1965 , which may be interpreted to be a thermonuclear runaway on the surface of the white dwarf ( fitzgerald et al .",
    "a similar nova - like optical outburst occurred in hm sge in 1975 ( dokuchaeva 1976 ) .",
    "these two symbiotic stars are known to exhibit fairly strong raman scattered o  vi 6825 with characteristic double peak profiles .",

    ", we investigate the effect of the introduction of a hot spot in a keplerian disk on the line profile .    in our monte carlo code ,",
    "photons generated in the specified region satisfying @xmath171 and @xmath172 is assigned a statistical weight of 4.8 , so that this region is 4.8 times brighter than other part of the emission region .",
    "this mimics the bright spots well known in cataclysmic variables , for which the accretion process takes place via roche lobe overflow . here , we do not consider the hot wind component that provided central absorption part in fig .",
    "[ bestfit ] .",
    "[ hotspot ] shows our profiles .",
    "the solid lines show the profiles from a keplerian disk with a hot spot , whereas the dots show the boes data .",
    "for the sake of comparisons , we also show the best fit profiles given in fig .",
    "[ bestfit ] by dotted lines .",
    "the fitting parameters for v1016  cyg are @xmath173 and @xmath174 . for hm",
    "sge , they are @xmath175 and @xmath176",
    ". it should be noted that the disk outer rims move slightly faster in this model than the ones considered in the case of the best fit model .",
    "the profiles provide good fits to the outer parts @xmath177 and @xmath178 , whereas poor fits are obtained near center .",
    "the introduction of a hot spot enhances the red peak .",
    "however , the conspicuous central dips in the observed data are not obtained in pure keplerian disk models with @xmath179 for @xmath180 .",
    "lowering @xmath5 makes the fit worse by narrowing the widths of the two peaks .",
    "in this work , we present our profile analysis of raman scattered o  vi 6825 in the symbiotic stars v1016  cyg and hm  sge , assuming that o  vi line photons are generated from a thin keplerian disk with a scattering region between the white dwarf and the mira giant .",
    "the neutral scattering region is assumed to be a spherical slow stellar wind with terminal wind velocity @xmath5 with an ionization front approximated by a hyperboloid .",
    "the best fitting parameters are @xmath1 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 for v1016  cyg and @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 for hm  sge .",
    "the overall fitting quality is quite insensitive to our choice of the inner radius of the o  vi emission region and the functional dependence of emissivity on radius .",
    "furthermore , the profile shape is little affected by the exact shape of the ionization structure , which is determined by the mass loss rate of the mira component and the ionizing luminosity from the white dwarf component .",
    "however , the ionization structure mainly affects the total flux of raman scattered 6825 . in this point",
    ", an independent study should be added to current work in order to adequately probe the ionization structure and mass loss and transfer processes in symbiotic stars ( e.g. jung & lee 2004 ) .",
    "although the introduction of a hot spot in our keplerian disk model failed to improve the profile fitting quality in the case of v1016  cyg and hm  sge , this should not mean to exclude the possibility of the asymmetrical emission in symbiotic stars .",
    "as harries & howarth ( 1996 ) reported , triple peak structures in raman scattered 6825 in symbiotics are more prevalent than double peak profiles in symbiotic stars .",
    "it is quite probable that more complicated profiles may be fitted using more ingredients in the emission and/or scattering regions .",
    "the resonance scattering o  vi component considered in section 4.3 may be envisioned as a part of ionized giant stellar wind , in the vicinity of the inner lagrange point . in order to scatter a significant fraction of slightly blue o  vi photons",
    ", the region should move toward the main o  vi line emission region around the white dwarf .",
    "we may note that the bestfit speed @xmath186 in fig .",
    "[ bestfit ] is slightly less than the giant wind terminal velocity . because @xmath186 is the velocity component along the direction connecting the giant and the white dwarf",
    ", we may interpret that the resonantly scattering o  vi region passes through the inner lagrange point making an angle @xmath187 under the assumption that the speed of the region is coincident with the wind terminal velocity @xmath5 . with the wide binary orbit of @xmath188 au the orbital speed of the giant component in both v1016  cyg and hm",
    "sge is comparable to @xmath186 .",
    "although we only consider the spherical wind around the mira type giant component in the current work , it is also a possibility that the wind around the giant component also possesses an azimuthal component , in which case this inference of @xmath189 should be corrected appropriately .",
    "refined hydrodynamical studies may shed more light on the mass transfer processes in symbiotic stars .",
    "the red wing excess in v1016  cyg that is not well fitted by our model may indicate the existence of another emission component and/or a neutral scattering region .",
    "spectropolarimetric studies by harries & howarth ( 1996 ) show that the far red wing part is polarized in the direction perpendicular to that for the remainder part .",
    "these facts are consistent when the additional emission and/or neutral component is receding with a velocity of several tens of @xmath190 perpendicular to the binary orbital plane .",
    "it is unclear that this component is associated with the bipolar structure of these objects .",
    "solf ( 1983 , 1984 ) detected a bipolar outflow in [ n ii ] lines in hm  sge .",
    "the velocity scale of several tens of km s@xmath191 is much smaller than the usual velocity scale associated with the fast hot wind that may emanate from a deep inner region of an accretion disk in the vicinity of the hot star .",
    "schmid et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported the existence of broad wing components in o  vi 1032 , 1038 observed with orfeus . even though the broad wings are consistent with the electron scattering origin , a fast bipolar wind around the hot component can also be a candidate .",
    "it is an interesting possibility that the component responsible for resonance scattering of o  vi is a clumpy one driven by the fast hot wind moving in the polar directions .",
    "more interesting results are expected when photoionization calculations and hydrodynamical studies can be combined with spectropolarimetric polarimetric observations of these symbiotic objects .",
    "it is also interesting that these two symbiotic stars exhibit he ii raman scattered features blueward of h balmer lines . in particular , raman scattered he ii 4850 features of v1016 cyg and hm sge exhibit no multiple peak structures ( e.g. jung & lee 2004 , birriel 2004 ) . because the cross section for he ii raman scattering is larger than that for o  vi raman scattering by two orders of magnitude , we may expect that the scattering region is much more extended than the raman o  vi counterpart .    the profiles of raman o  vi 6825 in v1016  cyg and hm  sge are totally different from other high ionization lines including he  ii .",
    "for example , he  ii  4686 emission lines of v1016  cyg and hm  sge are single - peaked with slight blue asymmetry .",
    "robinson et al . ( 1994 ) considered line profiles from accretion disks in symbiotic stars , and it appears to be difficult to infer the existence of an accretion disk in symbiotic stars from these emission lines .",
    "it may be that the he  ii emission region is more extended than the o  vi emission region .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to model other emission lines and more sophisticated models including photoionization and hydrodynamics are required .",
    "the disparity of the profiles in raman scattered o  vi 6825 and raman scattered o  vi 7088 can be an important clue to the structure of the accretion disk in symbiotic stars .",
    "a number of researchers pointed out the relative weakness in the blue part of raman o  vi 7088 ( e.g. schmid et al .",
    "1999 , harries & howarth 1996 ) .",
    "the profile difference in resonance doublets of @xmath192 was reported in symbiotic stars and young planetary nebulae ( e.g. feibelman 1983 ) .",
