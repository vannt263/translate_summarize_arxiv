    "suppose , one observes two stretches of time series data @xmath1 and @xmath2 generated by some unknown stationary time series processes .",
    "the question whether the models where these two stretches come from are identical is of considerable interest and has been investigated elaborately in statistical literature .",
    "for instance , by imposing certain parametric assumptions on the data generation process ( dgp ) , it becomes possible to compare suitable estimated parameters to judge how `` near '' the related models are .",
    "the assumption of underlying autoregressive processes of some finite order , say , allows to compare estimated coefficients to quantify the nearness of both dgps . but these models are usually not valid if the parametric assumption is not fulfilled .",
    "therefore , nonparametric methods are desired that can be justified theoretically for a broader class of stochastic processes .",
    "if one is interested in second order properties , it seems obvious to focus on autocovariances @xmath3 , autocorrelations @xmath4 or spectral densities @xmath5 , where the latter choice has some advantages over the others , see , for example , paparoditis @xcite . over the years",
    ", several test statistics have been introduced that could be used for testing the null hypothesis @xmath6 \\bigr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] versus the alternative @xmath7 .",
    "these may be periodogram - based , see , for example , coates and diggle @xcite , ptscher and reschenhofer @xcite , diggle and fisher @xcite , caiado _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and preuss and hildebrandt @xcite , or based on kernel spectral density estimators , see , for example , maharaj @xcite , eichler @xcite or dette and paparoditis @xcite .",
    "jentsch and pauly @xcite have investigated the asymptotic properties of test statistics closely related to `` periodogram - based distances '' proposed by caiado _",
    "they show that contrary to integrated periodograms these tests are usually not consistent which is caused by the use of non - consistent estimators for the spectral densities , the periodograms .",
    "in contrast to that , @xmath0-type statistics based on the smoothed periodogram are shown to be consistent , see paparoditis @xcite , eichler @xcite , dette and paparoditis @xcite and jentsch @xcite . a possible test statistic for testing equality of spectral densities is therefore a suitable inflated version of @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are nonparametric kernel estimators of the spectras .",
    "central limit theorems for such statistics can be found in the above mentioned literature .",
    "for instance , paparoditis @xcite has emphasized that statistics of this kind converge very slowly to a normal distribution , which results in a poor performance of the corresponding asymptotic test , particularly for small sample sizes .",
    "therefore , other approaches as bootstrap or resampling techniques in general are needed to improve the small sample behavior of these tests .",
    "paparoditis @xcite has used a ( parametric ) arma - bootstrap for goodness - of - fit testing and dette and paparoditis @xcite have proposed a different approach based on the asymptotic wishart - distribution of periodogram matrices .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the more general testing problem of comparing the spectral density matrices of several , not necessarily independent , stationary processes . as motivated above , we will use an @xmath0-type statistic of the form ( [ l2typform ] ) which is adjusted for this multiple sample testing problem . to overcome the slow convergence speed of our test statistic",
    ", we propose a resampling method to compute critical values , the randomization technique , that exploits the well - known asymptotic independence of periodograms @xmath11 and @xmath12 for different frequencies @xmath13 with @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "a nice feature of this approach is that only one tuning parameter , the bandwidth of the involved kernel spectral densities , has to be selected .",
    "this can be done automatically by selection procedures based on cross validation as has been proposed by beltro and bloomfield @xcite and robinson @xcite . in comparison to other mainstream resampling techniques as for example , the autoregressive sieve or block bootstrap techniques",
    ", it has the advantage that no other tuning parameter as order or block length has to be assessed in addition to the bandwidth .",
    "it is worth noting that these choices appear to be very crucial in applications and the performance of the corresponding tests usually reacts very sensitive on the choice of these quantities .",
    "nevertheless , these procedures are not applicable ( at least ) directly , because they do not mimic the desired null distribution under the alternative automatically .",
    "moreover , the usage of randomization methods is very natural and has also been proposed by diggle and fisher @xcite for the special ( and included ) testing problem of comparing the spectral densities of two independent univariate stationary time series .",
    "this idea has been adopted by maharaj @xcite for comparing evolutionary spectra of univariate nonstationary time series . in both papers , the authors ( only )",
    "account for the application of this procedure with the help of simulations and the following nice heuristic .",
    "recall that a randomization test holds the prescribed level @xmath15 exact for finite sample sizes if the data is invariant under the corresponding randomization group , see , for example , lehmann and romano @xcite . since @xmath16 and @xmath17 are asymptotically exchangeable in the case of independent time series",
    ", one would suggest that a randomization test , say @xmath18 , for ( [ h0special ] ) based on periodograms or functions of periodograms is at least asymptotically exact , that is , @xmath19 holds as @xmath20 .",
    "however , this is only a conjecture and so far the randomization technique has not been analyzed in this context from a mathematical point of view in the literature .",
    "this is without question meaningful since it is offhand not clear in which situations it is applicable .",
    "we will close this gap in the next sections by investigating more general and in mathematical detail whether at all and , if true , under which possibly needed additional assumptions randomization - based testing procedures lead to success , that is , asymptotically exact and consistent tests . amongst others",
    "it will turn out that this can be done effectively for testing the special null hypothesis  ( [ h0special]).=1    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section  [ subsecnotation ] , we introduce our notation , state the general testing problem and define the @xmath0-type test statistic .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] presents the main assumptions on the process and states asymptotic results for the test statistic which lead to an asymptotically exact and consistent benchmark test .",
    "the randomization procedure together with a corresponding discussion about its consistency is described in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "based on our theoretical results we compare the proposed tests in the special situation of testing for ( [ h0special ] ) in an extensive simulation study in section  [ sec5 ] , where the effects of dependence and bandwidth choice on the size and power behavior of both types of tests are investigated .",

    "observe that due to the sophisticated condition in corollary  [ corollary1 ] , a result for general @xmath222 equivalent to ( iv ) in corollary  [ corollary2 ] does not seem to be achievable .",
    "nevertheless , there is an obvious possibility for constructing another randomization test that works even if the presumption ( [ eq11 ] ) of corollary  [ corollary1 ] is not fulfilled .",
    "we just have to impose an estimator for the conditional limit variance @xmath176 of @xmath164 as introduced in theorem  [ theorem4 ] .",
    "an appropriate candidate is given by @xmath223 and the corresponding randomization test is @xmath224 , where @xmath225 denotes the data - dependent @xmath191-quantile of the conditional distribution of @xmath226 given the data .",
    "let us shortly state its properties .",
    "[ corollary3 ] suppose that the assumptions of theorem  [ theorem 21 ] hold .",
    "then the test @xmath227 is not only of asymptotic level @xmath15 under @xmath74 but also consistent for testing @xmath74 versus @xmath127 , that is , @xmath228 under @xmath127 as @xmath229 .",
    "finally , we like to note that some of the assumptions can be weakened for linear processes . in particular , by combining theorem  [ theorem4 ] above with results of dette and paparoditis @xcite we gain the following remark .",
    "[ linear processes ] if the process posses a linear structure , that is , @xmath230 for a @xmath21-dimensional i.i.d .",
    "white noise @xmath231 and a sequence of @xmath26-matrices @xmath232 , condition ( [ fouriertransform ] ) is not needed and the mixing assumption  [ ass1 ] in the above corollaries [ corollary1][corollary3 ] can be substituted by the summable condition @xmath233 and the moment condition @xmath234 .",
    "for the two sample testing problem as described in the introductory part our randomization test has a nice reading as a symmetry test .",
    "this is part of the following remark .",
    "remark that we can rewrite ( in distributional equality ) the summands of our randomization statistic for @xmath111 as @xmath235 where @xmath236 are i.i.d .",
    "signs , that is , independent and on @xmath237 uniformly distributed r.v.s , and we set @xmath238 as well as @xmath239 for @xmath162 .",
    "hence , the above defined randomization tests can be interpreted as some general kind of conditional symmetry tests in this situation .",
    "[ sensitivity remark ] as already mentioned in the , our randomization approach has the nice advantage that the bandwidth is the only tuning parameter that has to be assessed .",
    "this feature becomes even better as we will see in our extensive simulation study , see section  [ sec5 ] below , where our approach does not react very sensitive to variations of the bandwidth @xmath63 . however , it is of course desirable to have a detached principle for selecting the bandwidth .",
    "therefore , we use a data driven cross validation method for choosing @xmath63 for the kernel spectral density estimation .",
    "this method is due to beltro and bloomfield @xcite and robinson @xcite and has also been applied by paparoditis @xcite .",
    "finally , we also like to discuss the local power of all randomization tests .",
    "[ corollary4 ] suppose that the assumptions of theorem  [ theorem : loclaalternatives ] hold .",
    "a.   the test @xmath227 has the same local power as the asymptotic test @xmath125 , i.e. we have @xmath240 under local alternatives ( [ localalternatives ] ) with @xmath241 , where @xmath145 is given in theorem  [ theorem : loclaalternatives ] .",
    "b.   in addition , suppose that @xmath242 in ( [ localalternatives ] ) satisfies ( [ eq11 ] )",

    "its performance is _ in general _ significantly better than those of the asymptotic benchmark test @xmath125 . * even for larger sample sizes up to @xmath308 the asymptotic test @xmath125 can not be recommended due to its very slow convergence as emphasized in table  [ table_sample_sizes ] . * in comparison to other resampling methods applied in time series analysis , the randomization technique used here has the big advantage that their performance does not depend on the choice of any tuning parameter in addition to the bandwidth .",
    "the choice of the bandwidth can be done automatically by standard methods and does not seem to be as crucial as for @xmath125 . *",
    "the performance of @xmath243 becomes even more excellent if we compare its behavior for the very small sample size of @xmath322 with the poor performance of the unconditional test . * in comparison to that the only other known and mathematically analyzed resampling test for @xmath74 , the bootstrap test of dette and paparoditis @xcite , needs sample sizes of @xmath338 for gaining comparable results ( see table @xmath339 in their paper ) .",
    "remark that they have also modeled a @xmath340 model under the null with gaussian innovations .",
    "when comparing their results with ours ( see table  [ table_ar_h0 ] in this paper ) note that @xmath341 in their paper corresponds to our model @xmath265 , but with the ( slightly less critical ) choice @xmath342 * furthermore , the power performance of @xmath243 improves with increasing sample size ( as usual under consistency ) .",
    "the simulations in the supplementary material even show that the power behavior ( measured as power in comparison to actual size ) is similar to that of the benchmark test @xmath125 and all other randomization tests .",
    "* finally , to sum up , the randomization procedure helps to hold the prescribed level under the null more satisfactorily and does not forfeit power under the alternative in comparison to the unconditional case .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced novel randomization - type tests for comparing spectral density matrices .",
    "their theoretical properties have been analyzed in detail and we have also studied their finite sample performance in extensive simulation studies .",
    "the asymptotic behavior under the null as well as for fixed and local alternatives have been developed for non - linear time series under a joint cumulant condition ( [ ass1 ] ) , whereas for linear processes finite @xmath343nd moments are required .",
    "although these conditions seem to be rather strong , we like to mention that only a few mathematical results on this topic can be found in the current literature , where most of them are only developed for the one - dimensional case .",
    "note , that such , or stronger linearity or even gaussianity conditions are typical assumptions in recent time series publications , see , for example , eichler @xcite , dette and paparoditis @xcite , dette and hildebrandt @xcite , jentsch @xcite , jentsch and pauly @xcite , preuss and hildebrandt @xcite or preuss _ et al .",
    "moreover , one of the main contributions of the current paper is the theoretical justification of the randomization approach , which has yet not been achieved in the time series context .    in future research , we aim to get rid of the last tuning parameter ( i.e. , the bandwidth ) by studying a different test statistic that is based on integrated periodograms rather than kernel spectral density estimators . in doing so",
    ", we also plan to relax the conditions on the process in the non - linear case and to investigate to what extend our theory can still be established .",
    "as pointed out by one referee , a promising approach may be given by substituting our joint cumulant condition by physical - dependence - type - conditions introduced in wu @xcite and further studied in for example , liu and wu @xcite or xiao and wu @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge the theory is currently not available in full strength for our setting , that is , for multivariate @xmath83-sample problems with dependencies and triangular arrays .",
    "the latter is required to derive the local power behavior of our test statistic .",
    "in the following and for a better lucidity of the proofs , we will use the abbreviate notation @xmath344 and @xmath345 .",
