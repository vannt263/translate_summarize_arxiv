    "the strength of the qubit coupling to the environment should be sufficiently well controlled so that the residual environmental interactions are below a threshold set by the operating speed of the device@xcite .    since the first proposal in ref .  , the qubit candidate based on localized electron spins in quantum dots has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "there have already been quite a few studies of the relaxation time of electron spins in gaas quantum dots .",
    "the role of various spin - orbit related mechanisms has been considered for spin - flip transitions between singlet and triplets@xcite and zeeman split doublets@xcite .",
    "the hyperfine mediated spin - flip rates were investigated for singlet - triplet@xcite and doublet@xcite transitions .",
    "a novel spin - flip mechanism due to interface motion has also been investigated@xcite and coulomb blockade effects in the nuclear spin relaxation time were looked at in ref .  .",
    "for gaas quantum dots measurements of spin relaxation times , or @xmath2 , between singlet - triplet states@xcite and doublet@xcite states have been done .",
    "the measurements give @xmath3@xmath4s ( singlet - triplet ) and @xmath5@xmath4s ( doublet ) .",
    "for the doublet measurements only a lower bound for the relaxation time is obtained @xcite , so comparison to various theoretical calculations remains difficult .",
    "the operation of a qubit requires a coherent superposition of states that persists during the time of the qubit operation .",
    "several papers have addressed the question of the decoherence time of electron spin in gaas quantum dots .",
    "the decoherence of a single electron spin may be caused by inhomogeneous hyperfine interaction@xcite but when an ensemble of electron spins is considered the timescale of decoherence is determined by the fluctuations in the total field which acts on the electron spin due to the nuclei@xcite .",
    "the role of fluctuations in the nuclear spin system , socalled spectral diffusion , on the electron spin decoherence has also been studied@xcite .    in ref .",
    "the characteristic timescale for the decay of a specific correlation function was associated with the decoherence time of the electron spin .",
    "the decohence in this case was attributed to the spatially dependent hyperfine coupling constant which caused small frequency changes through flip - flop processes involving spatially separated nuclei .",
    "a different approach was used in ref .   which relied on representing the nuclear spin system as an effective nuclear magnetic field that couples to the electron spin in the quantum dot .",
    "et al_.  discussed some basic features of this semi - classical approach but the calculations were done for ensemble averaged quantities@xcite . in the present work we combine the approaches mentioned and extend the semiclassical effective - field method @xcite to include the effects of the spatially varying hyperfine coupling constant .",
    "due to the large difference of timescales for the electron and nuclear spin systems we are able to solve the problem in two steps .",
    "in the first step we establish that the nuclear system can be treated as an adiabatic effective nuclear magnetic field acting on the electron .",
    "the latter step involves the back action of the electron spin which will determine the evolution of the nuclear spins .",
    "the fact that the single electron spin is coupled to a large number of nuclei in the quantum dot , @xmath6 , but each nucleus is only coupled to the single electron spin hints at an asymmetry in the behavior of the electron and nuclear spins .",
    "the electron precesses in an effective nuclear magnetic field which is due to the whole nuclear spin system .",
    "this field is @xmath7 times larger than the corresponding hyperfine field due to the single electron spin in which the nuclear spins precess .",
    "thus the dynamics of the electron are much faster than the dynamics of the nuclei .",
    "also , the large number of nuclei involved makes it possible to treat the nuclear system in a semi - classical way@xcite .",
    "we do not include the dipole - dipole interaction of the nuclei , since the effects of such interaction can only become noticeable at very long timescale ( @xmath8sec , for gaas quantum dots @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting dynamics are represented by a set of equations of motion for several subsystems of nuclear spins .",
    "each subsystem is characterized by the same value of coupling to the electron spin .",
    "the dynamical equations are non - linear and comprise many degrees of freedom . from this ,",
    "one generally expects chaotic and ergodic dynamics , so that the memory about initial conditions is lost at a certain time scale .",
    "this would result in the decay of correlation functions at this time scale and was an initial motivation of this research .",
    "however , we prove that the actual dynamics is not chaotic .",
    "the calculated correlation functions show complex , yet regular , oscillations that persist for long timescale without discernible decay . we explain this by conjecturing that the system has many integrals of motion so it is close to exactly integrable one .",
    "if we average the dynamics over all possible initial conditions , the averaged correlation function does show decay in time . for large times",
    ", it is inversely proportional to logarithm of time .",
    "the remaining text of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : hyperfine ] the hyperfine interaction in a quantum dot is presented and its semi - classical representation discussed .",

    "the focus will be on electrons localized in a quantum dot , and the hyperfine interaction in such systems .",
    "the quantum dots considered here are quite general , but we introduce some restrictions to simplify the model .",
    "first of all it is assumed that the number of electrons is fixed , preferably to one . from the experimental point of view",
    "this assumptions is quite reasonable since having only a single electron in the dot has already been demonstrated experimentally@xcite .",
    "the second assumption is that the orbital level splitting is much larger than the hyperfine energy . in this case",
    "the hyperfine hamiltonian can be projected to the lowest orbital level since contributions from higher orbitals are strongly suppressed due to the large orbital energy separation .",

    "when the electrons interacts with so many nuclei it is possible to interpret the combined effect of the nuclei as an effective magnetic field . before proceeding further it is convenient to introduce a different way of writing the hyperfine interaction in the last term in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the wave function of the ground state orbital has some characteristic spatial extent which is determined by the confining potential . without loss of generality",
    "it may be assumed that the lateral ( with respect to the underlying 2deg ) and transverse confining lengths are @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively . defining the volume of the quantum dot as @xmath26 , a dimensionless function is introduced : @xmath27 furthermore , denoting the maximum value of @xmath28 with @xmath29 we introduce a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath30 the hyperfine coupling constant may be expressed in terms of the concentration , @xmath31 , of nuclei with spin @xmath32 and a characteristic energy @xmath33 through the relation @xmath34 .",

    "the power spectrum is the fourier spectrum of the _ time averaged _ correlation functions , which are completely different from the power spectra expected for the ensemble averaged correlation functions shown in fig .",

    "this implies that the time average and the ensemble average are not equivalent , i.e.  the system in question is not ergodic .",

    "get contributions from many ` systems ' which have different values of the integrals of motion that results in an effective cancellation of periodic oscillations , leading to a decay of the correlation functions .",
    "the behavior of the correlation functions for the single system may be broadly explained in this way : the oscillations of the correlation function reflect that the system is in some sense close to being exactly solvable .",

    "even though in this model nuclear spins do not decohere the electron spin ( in the sense of not causing decay of correlation functions as a function of time ) , they leads to a complicated , and unpredictable , evolution .",
    "consequently , an electron spin initially in @xmath139 can be found in the opposite spin state on a timescale @xmath140 .",
