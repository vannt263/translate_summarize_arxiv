    "in physics the search and study of exactly solvable systems have a long history . in non relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "a problem thoroughly investigated is to find potentials for which we can solve exactly their schrdinger equations in terms of special functions , since they can be used as a basis in the analysis of more realistic problems and their solutions can be exploited to test numerical calculations .",
    "several methods have been developed to obtain exact solutions to the schrdinger equation @xcite@xcite , here we mention the methods based on the point canonical transformations @xcite , on the darboux transformations @xcite , @xcite , and on the supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite@xcite ( see also the factorization method @xcite@xcite related to the supersymmetric quantum mechanics ) .    at present time we know many potentials for which we can solve exactly their schrdinger equations @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are potentials for which we can find their solutions in terms of special functions only if the parameters satisfy some condition @xcite@xcite .",
    "they are called conditionally exactly solvable potentials ( ces potentials ) .    in this work ,",
    "our main objective is to give two potentials defined on the half line @xmath0 such that each linearly independent solution of the schrdinger equations includes a sum of two confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "as far as we know these potentials are not previously studied @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite . here",
    "we notice that the method used in this paper works simultaneously with the two schrdinger equations of the partner potentials .",
    "the potentials that we study in this paper are algebraic modifications of the coulomb potential ( see the expression ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) )",
    ". these potentials may be useful in the study of physical systems for which we expect deviations from the coulomb potential near @xmath1 , but that are of coulomb type as @xmath2 .",
    "it is convenient to notice that potentials with negative fractional powers have been used as models to study the quark - antiquark interaction @xcite and sharp resonances @xcite . from the shape of the potentials ( see figure 2 below ) we think that these can be useful models to study scattering and tunneling problems @xcite . furthermore , in an interval the shape of the potential that we call @xmath3 reminds us to the effective potentials that appear in the analysis of the propagation of the dirac field in curved spacetimes , for example , in the schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in sect .",
    "[ s : method ] we expound the potentials that we study through this work and we solve the schrdinger equations of these potentials .",
    "we also find some properties of these solutions .",
    "finally in sect .",
    "[ s : discussion ] we discuss other properties of these potentials .",
    "here we show that for @xmath4 and for the potentials @xmath5 we can solve the schrdinger equations @xmath6 in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions . as @xmath7 . ] for the potentials ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) the superpotential @xmath8 is equal to @xcite@xcite @xmath9 thus , in the standard language of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics , @xmath10 and @xmath3 are partner potentials @xcite@xcite .    the partner potentials ( [ e : ces potentials ] )",
    "are ces since the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 that multiply to the factors @xmath13 and @xmath14 satisfy the condition @xmath15 as far as we see the partner potentials ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) do not appear in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite that enumerate the previously known exactly solvable potentials of the schrdinger equation .",
    "moreover the ces potentials ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) remind us to those of refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are constants , since they include negative fractional powers of the variable @xmath21 in addition to negative integral powers of the same variable .",

    "we also point out that the ces potentials @xmath31 go to zero in the form @xmath13 as @xmath27 , and they diverge as @xmath14 as @xmath32 .",
    "the potential @xmath10 is strictly positive , whereas the potential @xmath3 crosses the @xmath21 axis at @xmath33 .",
    "since the derivatives of the partner potentials ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) are equal to @xmath34 the potential @xmath10 is a decreasing function , and we get that the derivative of @xmath3 is equal to zero at @xmath35 . this critical point is a maximum .",
    "notice that @xmath36 , that is , the coordinate of the maximum is larger than the point where the potential @xmath3 crosses the @xmath21 axis . for @xmath4 the superpotential @xmath8 is strictly negative and it is an increasing function . for @xmath8 and @xmath31",
    "we illustrate these facts in figs .  1 , 2 .    for @xmath37",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the schrdinger equations ( [ e : schrodinger equation ] ) for partner potentials transform into @xmath38 from these equations we get that the functions @xmath39 must be solutions to the coupled system of first order differential equations @xmath40 and defining the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 by @xmath43 we find that the schrdinger equations ( [ e : schrodinger equation ] ) of partner potentials simplify to the system of coupled differential equations for the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath44    thus to solve the schrdinger equations of the partner potentials ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) we make the change of variable @xmath45 to obtain that eqs .",

    "furthermore , to increase the readability , in the expressions that follow we replace the quantities @xmath67 and @xmath68 by their numerical values , but we preserve the parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "we have not been able to transform the linearly independent solutions ( [ e : zeta one ] ) , ( [ e : zeta two ] ) and write them in terms of one confluent hypergeometric function , but we think that this fact must be considered in detail . thus we find in explicit form the partner potentials ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) whose linearly independent solutions include the sum of two confluent hypergeometric functions ( see ( [ e : r tilde definition ] ) , ( [ e : zeta one ] ) , and ( [ e : zeta two ] ) ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite some potentials with this property are studied , but they are given in implicit form .",
    "hence the partner potentials ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) expand the previously known examples of potentials whose linearly independent solutions include a sum of ( confluent ) hypergeometric type functions @xcite",
    ".    furthermore the ces potentials @xmath31 are multiplicative shape invariant @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . from their expressions ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) we find that they satisfy @xmath90 .",
    "when we compare with the definition of shape invariance for the partner potentials @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 are parameters and @xmath94 is a function of @xmath92 , we find that the partner potentials @xmath31 fulfill @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and hence , @xmath98 . we notice that the previously published multiplicative shape invariant potentials only are known in series form @xcite , @xcite , in contrast we find the potentials ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) in closed form .    in ref .",

    "@xcite , @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the limit of the superpotential @xmath8 as @xmath99 ( see ( [ e : limits potentials superpotential ] ) ) , we get that the phase shifts of the ces potentials ( [ e : ces potentials ] ) fulfill @xmath105 where @xmath106 is an integer .    from our previous results",
    "we think that a research problem is the search , in explicit form , of potentials for which each linearly independent solution of their schrdinger equations includes a sum of three ( or four , five ,  ) ( confluent ) hypergeometric functions .",
    "for the case of three ( confluent ) hypergeometric functions we expect that the first linearly independent solution takes the form @xmath107 where @xmath108 are functions of @xmath21 and @xmath109 denotes the ( confluent ) hypergeometric functions ( a similar expression is valid for the second linearly independent solution ) . ) and ( [ e : zeta two ] ) for linearly independent solutions of the schrdinger equation that include two confluent hypergeometric functions . ]",
