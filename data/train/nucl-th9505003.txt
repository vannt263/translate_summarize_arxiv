    "the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approximation [ 1 ] is an interesting alternative to more conventional approaches to the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "numerous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of the rmf approach in describing the behavior of nucleons in the nuclear medium .",
    "recent rmf calculations of @xmath2- and multi @xmath2 hypernuclei [ 2 - 4 ] have shown that it can be successfully extended to the more general baryon - nucleus systems [ 5 - 9 ] .",
    "hyperon - nucleus scattering has been studied as well [ 10 ] . in these works , the meson  hyperon coupling constants were either fitted to known hypernuclear spectra or obtained from the parameters of a nucleon shell model by using the constituent quark model .",
    "calculations of @xmath1-hypernuclei [ 11 ] have often been based on analyses of @xmath0 atomic data [ 12,13 ] in terms of attractive and absorptive @xmath1-nucleus potentials , yielding in the nuclear interior depth values @xmath3 however , a considerably shallower potential , particularly for re@xmath4 , is indicated by fitting to @xmath1-hypernuclear spectra from ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) reactions [ 14 ] . furthermore , a very recent phenomenological analysis of level shifts and widths in @xmath0 atoms by batty",
    "_ et al_. [ 15 ] suggests that re@xmath4 is attractive only at the nuclear surface , changing into a repulsive potential as the density increases in the nuclear interior .",
    "although the magnitude of the repulsive component can not be determined unambiguously by the atomic data , the small attractive pocket of such potentials does not provide sufficient binding to form @xmath1-hypernuclei .",
    "this conclusion has been independently arrived at by harada [ 16 ] , folding a soft - core repulsive plus long - range attractive @xmath7 interaction into the nuclear density .    in view of the above seemingly conflicting observations , it is topical to use the rmf approach directly for constructing the @xmath1-nucleus optical potential by fitting to @xmath0 atomic data .",
    "the aims of the present work are :    1 .   to check whether or not the rmf approach can reproduce the atomic data ; 2 .   to establish constraints imposed by fitting to the data on the scalar and vector meson couplings to a @xmath1 hyperon ; 3",
    ".   to establish the size of the isovector - vector meson - hyperon coupling ; 4 .   to investigate the sign of the @xmath1-nucleus potential in the nuclear interior and whether or not @xmath1 hypernuclear bound states are expected to exist .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "2 presents updated fits of a phenomenological density dependent ( dd ) optical potential . in sect .",
    "3 we introduce the rmf optical potential for @xmath1 , discuss the constraints imposed by the atomic data on its form and present results . these rmf results are compared with results of other approaches in sect .  4 which also offers a discussion and summary of our conclusions .",
    "before comparing the @xmath1-nucleus potentials based on the rmf approach to those derived using the phenomenological analysis , we took the intermediate step of replacing the  macroscopic \" nuclear densities ( such as 2-parameter fermi distributions ) used in the previous phenomenological analysis [ 15 ] by more realistic  microscopic \" densities .",
    "the motivation for this replacement is twofold : first , we wish to use densities that are more consistent with the resulting rmf densities , and second , it is desirable to use densities that are as appropriate as possible outside the nuclear surface , for discussing @xmath0 atoms .    in order to appreciate the latter point",
    ", we have repeated the `` notch test '' of ref . [",
    "15 ] in a modified form to see which range of radii has a significant effect on the atomic levels .",
    "the sensitivity of the data to the potential around the radius @xmath8 is obtained by multiplying the best - fit potential by a factor : @xmath9\\ ] ] representing a `` notch '' in the potential around @xmath10 spread approximately over @xmath11 ( in fm ) , whose relative depth is @xmath12 . by varying the depth @xmath12 and observing the changes in @xmath13 , the sensitivity ( defined as the values of @xmath12 that cause @xmath13 to increase by one unit ) can be determined .",
    "for @xmath14 the value of 0.5 fm was chosen . by scanning over @xmath8 , the radial region",
    "where the fit to the data is sensitive to the potential is determined .",
    "figure 1 shows the results obtained , using",
    " microscopic \" densities as described below , by scanning @xmath8 in steps of a nuclear diffuseness @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 fm and @xmath18 fm .",
    "it is seen that the radial region which is `` sampled '' by the data is outside of the nuclear surface .",
    "this updates the similar results shown in fig .  3 of ref . [",
    "15 ] using  macroscopic \" densities .",
    "the method chosen to generate ",
    "microscopic \" nuclear densities was to fill in single particle ( sp ) levels in woods - saxon potentials separately for protons and neutrons .",
    "the radius parameter of the potential was adjusted to reproduce the _ rms _ radius of the charge distribution ( after folding in the finite size of the proton ) .",
    "the binding energy of the least bound particle was set equal to the corresponding separation energy . for @xmath19 nuclei",
    "the _ rms _ radius of the neutron density distribution was chosen to be slightly larger than that of the protons . by using this method ,",
    "rather realistic density distributions are obtained in the region of the exponential fall - off .",
    "these densities are less reliable in the nuclear interior , but the @xmath0 atom data are not sensitive to this region as is clearly seen from fig .  1",
    ".    several of the fits of ref .",
    "[ 15 ] have been repeated using these sp densities .",
    "the @xmath0 nucleus potential is written as    @xmath20 \\rho(r)+\\left[b_1+b_1(\\frac{\\rho(r)}{\\rho(0)})^\\alpha\\right]\\delta\\rho(r ) \\right\\}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the @xmath1-nucleus reduced mass , m is the mass of the nucleon and @xmath22 is the nuclear density distribution normalized to the number of nucleons a. the isovector density distribution is given by @xmath23 .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given in units of fm and are obtained from fits to the @xmath0 atom data .",
    "for the density - independent @xmath26 potential ( @xmath27 ) , the results obtained with the sp densities were very similar to those obtained before [ 15 ] , namely , values of @xmath13 per degree of freedom , @xmath28 , were about 2.4 and the isovector part of the potential was not determined by the data . with the introduction of density dependence into the potential , substantial improvement in the fit to the data is observed .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath13 obtained with sp densities are significantly lower than those obtained with the schematic parameterization of the nuclear densities [ 15 ] . moreover , the real part of the isovector potential is now found to be reasonably well - determined , presumably because the sp densities represent more reliably the differences between protons and neutrons outside of the nuclear surface .",
    "results of two dd fits are summarized in table 1 .",
    "potential i is the analog of potential d or a of ref . [",
    "15 ] , where the density dependence is introduced only into the real isoscalar part via the parameter re@xmath29 .",
    "it is assumed throughout that im@xmath30=@xmath31im@xmath32 so that @xmath0 particles are absorbed only on protons .",
    "all four parameters varied in the fit are phenomenological and it is seen that they are reasonably well - determined . the dd exponent @xmath33 was held fixed during the parameter search and its value was subsequently varied between 0.1 and 1.1 and fits repeated .",
    "potential ii is analogous to the potential of ref .",
    "[ 15 ] for which the linear density terms were held fixed at values suggested by one boson exchange ( obe ) models : @xmath32=1.2@xmath340.45 fm , @xmath30=@xmath310.45@xmath350.45 fm . in this case , three adjustable parameters , namely , the complex @xmath29 and re@xmath36 ( im@xmath36=@xmath31im@xmath29 ) , were obtained from fits to the data . in both cases",
    "the fits are excellent and in both cases the variation of @xmath13 with @xmath33 was weak .",
    "the values shown in table 1 are typical examples and @xmath33 could not be determined uniquely in the range of 0.4 to 0.9 .    from the parameter values in table 1 it is seen that whereas the potentials are attractive at low densities , they become repulsive as the density approaches nuclear matter densities , a feature that had already been observed [ 15 ] .",
    "figure 2 shows the real and imaginary potentials for si , ca and pb near the nuclear surface .",
    "it is seen that there is a small attractive pocket near the surface and that the real potential becomes repulsive toward the interior .",
    "the imaginary potential is purely absorptive ; similar results for re@xmath37 are obtained if im@xmath37 is made to saturate at nuclear matter density [ 17 ] . it should be mentioned that with the limited data available and the very different quality of various data , the isovector part of the potential is determined solely by the experimental results for @xmath0 atomic pb .",
    "the rmf formalism describes baryons as dirac spinors coupled to scalar ( @xmath38 ) and vector ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) meson fields .",
    "the underlying rmf model used here is based on the lagrangian density of the form : @xmath41 @xmath42 \\psi_{\\sigma }   + { \\cal l}_{\\rho \\sigma } + { \\cal l}_{a \\sigma } \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; , \\ ] ] @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45    the standard form of @xmath46 can be found elsewhere [ 1 ] .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath47 includes interactions of a @xmath1 hyperon with the isoscalar ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) and isovector ( @xmath40 ) meson fields , as well as with the photon generating in leading order the charged @xmath1 coulomb field due to the nuclear charge distribution .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations lead to a coupled system of equations of motion for both baryon and meson fields . for the @xmath1 particle , and retaining only the timelike component @xmath21 = 0 for the vector fields in the mean ( meson ) field approximation , the resulting dirac equation acquires the form : @xmath48\\psi(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } ) = e\\psi(\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$ } ) \\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath49 are the scalar and vector potentials , respectively . in eq . ( 11 ) , @xmath50 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "more details about the equations of motion and their solution are given in ref . [ 18 ] .",
    "for each particular nucleus we constructed the schrdinger equivalent ( se ) @xmath1-nucleus potential from the scalar ( attractive ) and vector ( repulsive ) dirac potentials .",
    "the se potential @xmath53 was then used as a real part of the optical potential in the calculations of @xmath0 atoms : @xmath54 it is to be stressed here that the isovector part of the real potential comes out quite naturally in the rmf approach as one allows for coupling the @xmath1 with the @xmath40 field ( see eq.(11 ) for v(r ) ) .",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath1-nucleus optical potential describes the conversion of @xmath0 to @xmath2 via the reaction @xmath55 .",
    "the expression for the imaginary part of the potential ( and consequently the @xmath1-hypernuclear width ) was derived by gal and dover [ 13 ] and dabrowski and rozynek [ 19 ] .",
    "the values of the well - depth , @xmath56 , were estimated to be between 11.6 and 14  mev in nuclear matter . for finite nuclei , a reduction from these estimates should be expected . in the present work",
    "a phenomenological imaginary potential of the form @xmath57 was used , where the proton density @xmath58 was calculated in the rmf model and @xmath59 was taken as a parameter to be determined by fitting the atomic data .",
    "the use of @xmath58 in the construction of the imaginary potential reflects the fact that the @xmath0 conversion takes place exclusively on protons .",
    "for @xmath46 the linear ( l ) parametrization of horowitz and serot [ 18 ] was used as well as the nonlinear ( nl ) parametrization @xmath60 of reinhard _ et al . _",
    "[ 20 ] . for @xmath47",
    "the hyperon couplings were characterized as in previous works [ 2 - 10 ] via the coupling constant ratios @xmath61 , ( @xmath62 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) . in the case of the vector meson coupling ratio @xmath63",
    "three values , namely 1/3 , 2/3 and 1 , were used .",
    "the choice of @xmath64 was inspired by a number of early hypernuclear calculations [ 2,21 - 24 ] in which the strength of a hyperon ( mainly @xmath2 ) coupling used was between 1/3 and 0.4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the 2/3 ratio follows from the constituent quark model .",
    "finally , for @xmath65 , the equality @xmath66 is motivated by a recent qcd sum rule evaluation for @xmath1 hyperons in nuclear matter [ 25 ] .    for each of the above choices of @xmath63 the ratio @xmath67 together with @xmath59 from eq .",
    "( 13 ) were fitted to the experimental atomic shift and width in si .",
    "this particular atom was singled out due to its relatively accurate shift and width data among @xmath68 ( isoscalar ) core nuclei .",
    "the isovector part of the optical potential was then included and the ratio @xmath69 was determined by fitting the shift and width in pb while holding the isoscalar parametrization fixed .",
    "in such a way , we found for each rmf model , whether l or nl , three sets of parameters that give , by construction , an excellent fit for si and pb . typical results are illustrated in fig .  3 for @xmath1 nucleus nl optical potentials in si .",
    "when going from @xmath70 to 1 , re@xmath4 changes from attraction to repulsion in the nuclear interior .",
    "in addition , the imaginary part im@xmath4 becomes more absorptive .",
    "the same holds for the linear model which , for a given value of @xmath63 , predicts more attraction for re@xmath4 and less absorption for im@xmath4 than the nl parameterization yields , as is shown for @xmath71 in fig .  4 where @xmath1 optical potentials for pb are compared with each other .",
    "we observed that the @xmath40 - @xmath1 coupling is determined unambiguously by the fit to the pb data , with a value @xmath72 in all cases .",
    "having determined the isoscalar as well as isovector parameters of @xmath4 by fitting the si and pb data we constructed se optical potentials for all nuclei for which @xmath0 atomic data exist .",
    "whereas for @xmath71 and 1 we obtained reasonable values of @xmath13 without any further adjustments , we failed to get below @xmath73 for @xmath64 . the results for the linear model are presented in table  2 .",
    "it is to be noted that we did not aim strictly at the lowest @xmath13 value but merely to get @xmath74 , which is a typical value in previous dd fits [ 15 ] .",
    "consequently , only the value of @xmath13 for the potential l3 from table  2 represents a true minimum for this particular parametrization . from this point of view a comparison of @xmath13 values listed in table  2 might even be too favorable to the l3 potential .",
    "although the @xmath0 atomic data are of a poor quality and , moreover , determine the shape of @xmath4 only around the surface and outside the nucleus as demonstrated by the `` notch '' test ( fig .  1 )",
    ", these data nevertheless significantly constrain the rmf parametrization of the @xmath1 nucleus optical potential . not only that the value of the @xmath40-@xmath1 coupling ratio @xmath75 holds unambiguously for all the parametrizations used , but in addition , a weak @xmath39-@xmath1 coupling is almost certainly ruled out by fitting to the @xmath0 atom data .",
    "consequently , the data from @xmath0 atoms imply , within the rmf approach , a @xmath1-nucleus optical potential with a repulsion in the nuclear interior and a shallow attractive pocket outside the nuclear surface . for some light nuclei ( si ,",
    "s , mg ) , in contrast to fig .  4 for pb",
    ", the linear model with @xmath76 predicts that the repulsion in the interior goes back into a second shallow attractive pocket ( less than 3.5  mev ) at the origin , but this obviously can not be tested by using @xmath0 atom data .",
    "in this work we have improved on the phenomenological analysis [ 15 ] of @xmath0 atoms in terms of a @xmath1 nucleus dd optical potential by using nuclear density distributions which account more realistically for the nuclear surface region and outside of it .",
    "the earlier work [ 15 ] established that the isoscalar componenet of @xmath37 changes in the nuclear surface region from attraction to repulsion as one penetrates the nuclear interior , and that the isovector component is undetermined by the data .",
    "while the isoscalar component , in the present work , remains qualitatively unchanged , the introduction of these more realistic densities has a pronounced effect on the extraction of the isovector component of @xmath37 , which for @xmath0 is reliably determined to be _ repulsive_. it should be recalled that this extraction hinges almost exclusively on the shift and width data for pb [ 26 ] which are the most accurate among all available @xmath0 atom data to date , not just the @xmath77 data subset .",
    "more precise measurements , particularly for other @xmath77 atoms , are highly desirable .",
    "we have also confirmed the results of ref . [",
    "15 ] that @xmath37 is determined by the @xmath0  atom data only outside the nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , the novel feature of @xmath37 becoming repulsive is found to occur at a region of space outside the nuclear radius , still where @xmath37 is determined , even if not very accurately , by the @xmath0 atom data . to have a glimpse into the nuclear interior ,",
    "a theoretical model is necessary , and in the present work we have used rmf as a working hypothesis .",
    "although the rmf approach was applied before [ 7 , 8 ] , for studying the binding of @xmath1 hypernuclei , these studies were not constrained by any sound phenomenology since no @xmath1 hypernuclear bound state has ever been clearly established [ 11 ] , with the exception perhaps of a @xmath78 bound state [ 27 ] which is a too light system to be used as input to rmf calculations .",
    "furthermore , recent searches for @xmath1 hypernuclear peaks , some of which had been reported on the basis of limited statistics , have yielded negative result [ 28 , 29 ] .",
    "this leaves @xmath0 atom data as the sole source of any possible @xmath1 hypernuclear phenomenology .",
    "the application of the rmf calculational scheme to @xmath0 atom data in terms of three coupling - constant ratios ( @xmath79 ) has been successful in showing that very good quality fits , reproducing these data , can be made .",
    "the larger @xmath80 is ( in the range 0 to 1 ) , the better is the fit . of these",
    "fits the best ones , in the range @xmath81 to 1 , indeed produce se @xmath37 with a volume repulsion in the nuclear interior .",
    "the @xmath80 = 1 fit is an excellent one , reaching almost as low a @xmath13 value as those produced by the completely phenomenological dd optical potential fits of table 1 .",
    "the observation that using relatively high values of @xmath80 is distinctly superior to using relatively low values of @xmath80 within the rmf @xmath1-nuclear dynamics is in contrast to the situation in applying the rmf approach to @xmath2 hypernuclei [ 2 , 3 , 6 ] .",
    "there , as stressed in ref .",
    "[ 30 ] , a wider range of values for @xmath80 is roughly equally acceptable , since for any given value of @xmath80 the constraint of a @xmath2-nucleus potential well depth of about 28 mev attraction [ 31 ] can be satisfied by deriving an appropriate value for @xmath82 . in the absence of @xmath1 hypernuclear data ,",
    "no analogous constraint is operative for rmf @xmath1-nuclear applications .",
    "the volume repulsion obtained in this work for the isoscalar component of @xmath37 in fact precludes binding for @xmath1 hypernuclei , at least for those based on core nuclei with a small neutron excess , @xmath83 .",
    "it is gratifying to conclude that both approaches , the phenomenological one and the rmf approach , agree with each other , for a comparable degree of fit , in producing an isoscalar repulsion in the nuclear interior and , for @xmath0 , an added isovector repulsion . we stress that this isovector repulsion , with @xmath84 , was derived independently of the values assumed by the isoscalar coupling constants ratios .",
    "we recall that the common assumption of a pure @xmath85 coupling for the @xmath40 meson in su(3 ) , or equivalently of a universal @xmath40 coupling to isospin , gives @xmath86 , a value which is rather different from that determined by fitting to the @xmath0 atom data .",
    "however , it is well known that in the obe approach which unlike the rmf approach does use su(3 ) guidelines for connecting the @xmath87 sector to the @xmath88 sector , the nuclear isovector single - particle potential @xmath89 is generated largely by other meson contributions than that due to a direct @xmath40 exchange [ 32 ] . in the rmf approach ,",
    "the @xmath40 field is the only agency through which @xmath89 or @xmath90 can be generated , so that the statement @xmath91 is to be construed just as implying that @xmath92 , where the baryon - nucleus isovector potential contribution is defined by @xmath93    and @xmath94 is the nuclear isospin operator with @xmath95 .",
    "since the nuclear isovector potential close to zero energy is estimated [ 33 ] as @xmath96 120 mev , our estimate for @xmath90 , based on fitting @xmath0 atomic pb , is @xmath97 80 mev .",
    "this value may be compared with the value @xmath97 60 mev [ 20 ] , or @xmath97 55 mev [ 32 ] , both estimates following model d of the nijmegen group [ 34 ] in agreement with the estimate derived from the phenomenology of @xmath98 reactions [ 35 ] .    as in ordinary nuclear physics",
    ", the @xmath1-nucleus isovector potential cancels partly ( for charged @xmath99 ) the @xmath1 coulomb potential due to the nuclear charge distribution . for @xmath51",
    ", we have checked that the attractive symmetry - energy contribution due to @xmath90 generally does not overcome the repulsive isoscalar contribution plus the repulsive coulomb energy , so that it is unlikely to bind a @xmath51 in nuclei . for @xmath52 , where no symmetry energy or coulomb energy contribute ,",
    "binding is precluded by the volume repulsion of the isoscalar @xmath1 nucleus potential .",
    "these considerations have to be modified in very light hypernuclei where symmetry energy dominates over the coulomb interaction ( plus other charge - dependent effects due mostly to the mass differences within the @xmath1 charge triplet ) , leading to a better description of @xmath1 hypernuclei in terms of isospin eigenstates rather than charged @xmath1 states [ 35 ] . the only @xmath1 hypernuclear system for which this dominance has been established by a detailed calculation [ 36 ]",
    "is @xmath100 where the @xmath1-nucleus isovector potential , represented as a lane term of the form ( 14 ) , is responsible for the binding of the @xmath101 state . without this lane term",
    ", @xmath102 would be unbound .    for @xmath0 ,",
    "the attractive coulomb potential due to the nuclear charge distribution gives rise to an infinite set of @xmath0 atomic states .",
    "some of these states , however , for high @xmath103 nuclear cores , may be called nuclear states inasmuch as the corresponding wavefunctions are localized within the nucleus or in its immediate surface region . the energies and wavefunctions of these  nuclear \" states generated by @xmath104",

    "one gets a series of nuclear radius values @xmath8    @xmath121    such that for @xmath122 , the states of the first major shells up to and including @xmath123 are  nuclear \" . for @xmath116 ,",
    "this suggest that these @xmath1 harmonic oscillator states belonging to @xmath124 are  nuclear \" .",

    "the 1s level is very broad , about 36 mev , whereas the widths of the other levels are relatively small and vary between 1.2 mev to 2.6 mev .",
    "the wavefunctions of these other levels are  pushed \" by @xmath37 outside the nucleus .",
    "these states may be considered a special case of  coulomb assisted states \" , a concept put forward in ref .",
    "a reaction which would excite preferentially a single @xmath130 value for @xmath0 in @xmath116 , could locate these  nuclear \" states for @xmath131 .",
    "their location will give a valuable information on the nature ( attractive or repulsive ) of @xmath37 in this mass region .",
    "however , since these states are  pushed \" outside the nucleus , the cross sections to excite them by a nuclear reaction are not expected to be sizable .",
    "the chances of establishing a meaningful @xmath1 hypernuclear spectroscopy , therefore , are not particularly encouraging at present .",
