    "the formation of spiral galaxies is currently a subject of considerable interest in cosmology . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the formation of disk configurations is well understood as a result of specific angular momentum conservation during the collapse and relaxation of gas within dark matter potential wells ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "dark matter and baryons aquire similar specific angular momenta from tidal torques before collapse ( hoyle 1953 ; peebles 1969 ; white 1984 ) . provided the gas conserves this angular momentum , its collapse leads to a disk - like configuration at the centre of its dark matter halo .",
    "if stars form from this rotationally supported gas , then spiral disks like those observed can develop .",
    "however , centrifugally supported stellar disks are thickened or destroyed by rapid fluctuations in the gravitational potential such as those produced by the accretion of satellite galaxies ( toth & ostriker 1992 ; quinn , hernquist & fullagar 1993 ; velazquez & white 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of thin disks in many present - day spirals suggests that they had a relatively quiet mass accretion history , at least in the recent past .",
    "numerical simulations have become an important tool for studying galaxy formation due to their ability to describe the nonlinear , coupled evolution of dark matter and baryons in its cosmological context .",
    "however , this has turned out to be an extremely challenging problem because of the need to describe simultaneously the large - scale dynamics of galaxy assembly and the small - scale processes related to star formation and evolution .",
    "state - of - the - art simulations have implemented schematic recipes for radiative cooling , star formation , feedback from supernovae ( sn ) , stellar winds , black hole formation and active galactic nuclei .",
    "although these are successful in many respects , they have had difficulty reproducing extended disk - dominated galaxies in typical dark matter haloes .",
    "the main problem is so - called _ catastrophic angular momentum loss _ , which arises when the baryonic components transfer most of their angular momentum to the dark matter during condensation into the central regions , forming dominant spheroidal stellar systems and disks that are too small compared to observations ( e.g. navarro & benz 1991 ; navarro & white 1994 ) .    the formation of disks is heavily influenced by details of the gas cooling process .",
    "disks that are less centrally concentrated and with higher specific angular momentum are obtained if cooling is artificially suppressed during the assembly of dark matter haloes ( weil , eke & efstathiou 1998 ; eke , efstathiou & wright 2000 ) .",
    "many recent studies have attempted to prevent the early cooling of gas and the loss of angular momentum , some of them successfully reproducing disks as big as observed spirals ( e.g. abadi et al .",
    "2003 ; governato et al .",
    "2004 ; robertson et al . 2004",
    "; okamoto et al . 2005 ; governato et al . 2007 ) .",
    "these studies have pointed out the importance of stellar feedback as a key process providing pressure support to the gas and preventing its rapid collapse within the haloes , thereby regulating star formation activity .",
    "however , it seems that fine - tuning of the models is required in order to reproduce the observed properties of disk galaxies in a hierarchical scenario , and a detailed understanding of disk formation remains elusive .",
    "insufficient numerical resolution or a poor description of the interstellar medium ( which influences the efficiency of the stellar feedback ) have also been proposed as causes for the inability to reproduce convincing disk galaxies in simulations ( e.g. okamoto et al .",
    "2003 ; governato et al .",
    "2004 ) .    over the years",
    ", many authors have included star formation and feedback recipes both in mesh - based and in sph codes in order to study the effects of sn feedback on galaxy properties such as star formation histories , metallicity evolution , generation of galactic outflows , abundance of satellites and galaxy scaling relations ( e.g. katz & gunn 1991 ; cen & ostriker 1992 ; navarro & white 1993 ; metzler & evrard 1994 ; steinmetz & mller 1995 ; gerritsen & icke 1997 ; yepes et al . 1997 ; cen & ostriker 1999 ; sommer - larsen , gelato & vedel 1999 ; thacker & couchman 2000 ; kay et al .",

    "; governato et al . 2007 ; dalla vecchia & schaye 2008 ; dubois & teyssier 2008 ; finlator & dav 2008 ) .",
    "all these feedback implementations require arbitrary and _ ad hoc _ elements because the relevant dynamical processes can not be resolved by the simulations and so have to be introduced as `` sub - grid '' models . as a result ,",
    "their validity is uncertain and the conclusions to be drawn from their successes and failures are correspondingly unclear . a further difficulty is introduced by numerical limitations which have so far prevented the simulation at high resolution of a large and representative sample of galaxies in their proper cosmological setting ; typically , the evolution of a small number of selected objects is studied in detail , often chosen as those most likely to produce disk galaxies .",
    "it is thus uncertain whether existing models can successfully reproduce the variety of disk galaxies observed in the universe . in particular ,",
    "no @xmath4cdm simulation has yet managed to produce a late - type spiral like m33 or m101 .    in scannapieco",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , we have presented a new model for the effects of sn feedback in cosmological simulations .",
    "this model was implemented within the tree - pm sph code gadget-2 ( springel & hernquist 2002 ; springel 2005 ) , and is described in detail in scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "our model includes a scheme to treat a multiphase interstellar medium which allows the representation of a co - spatial mixture of cold and hot interstellar medium ( ism ) components without introducing scale - dependent parameters .",
    "energy and chemical feedback by type ii and type ia sne , as well as metal - dependent gas cooling ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) , are also considered .",
    "the model is intended to be as simple as possible and to introduce the fewest input parameters possible .",
    "it was specially designed to avoid the inclusion of mass - scale dependent parameters .",
    "this makes it suitable for running cosmological simulations where , at any given time , systems of different masses are forming simultaneously . in scannapieco",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) we tested the code by studying the formation of disk galaxies of different mass from idealized initial conditions",
    ". our scheme can reproduce several important effects in galaxy evolution : substantial metal - enhanced galactic winds are produced , redistributing mass and metals and generating a self - regulated cycle for star formation .",
    "the galactic winds are generated naturally in our model when the multiphase gas model and sn feedback are both included .",
    "this is an important result which allows us to consistently study the formation of galaxies together with the chemical enrichment and the redistribution of matter within the galaxies .",
    "potentially it should also allow investigation of other aspects such as the enrichment of the intergalactic medium .",
    "our model reproduces the expected dependence on galaxy mass : while star formation is suppressed at most by a factor of a few in massive galaxies , in low - mass systems the effects can be much larger , giving star formation an episodic , bursty character . in this paper",
    ", we extend the work of scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) by studying the formation of disk galaxies in their proper cosmological context .",
    "this allows a consistent treatment of processes such as mergers , interactions , inflows , tidal stripping , etc .",
    "we thus carry out higher resolution simulations from realistic initial conditions and follow the hierarchical growth of a galaxy similar in size and spin to our milky way .",
    "we focus on the effects of sn feedback on star formation and on galaxy morphology , emphasizing the dependence of the predictions on input parameters .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sims ]",
    "we describe the simulation code and list the characteristics of our simulations , briefly describing the inputs which are relevant for this work . in section  [ results ]",
    "we explore the effects of sn feedback on star formation ( subsection  [ sect_sfr ] ) , galaxy morphology ( subection  [ sect_morph ] ) and evolution of specific angular momentum ( subsection  [ sect_j_age_fe ] ) .",
    "we also study the formation process of the disk components found in our simulated galaxies ( subsection  [ stell_age ] ) and the resulting chemical properties ( subsection  [ chem_prop ] ) . in section  [ dwarf ]",
    "we investigate how sn feedback proceeds for smaller galaxies .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "the simulations in this paper were run with the code described in scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) , which is an extension of the parallel tree - pm sph code gadget-2 ( springel & hernquist 2002 ; springel 2005 ) .",
    "the code includes star formation , metal - dependent cooling , chemical enrichment and energy feedback by type ii and type ia supernovae , in addition to a multiphase treatment for the gas component . at the end of this section",
    ", we describe those input parameters of our model that are particularly relevant for the present study , and we refer the interested reader to scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for details on the implementation of star formation , chemical enrichment and metal - dependent cooling , and to scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for the description of the multiphase gas and energy feedback models .",
    "note that our multiphase treatment and our star formation and feedback models differ substantially from those of springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) although we do adopt their treatment of the uv background .",
    "we focus on a study of the formation of disk galaxies in their cosmological context . for this purpose",
    "we simulate a system with @xmath5 halo mass @xmath6 @xmath7 m@xmath1 , extracted from a large cosmological simulation and resimulated with improved resolution .",
    "our simulation runs from @xmath8 to @xmath5 and adopts a @xmath4cdm universe with the following cosmological parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , a normalization of the power spectrum of @xmath12 and @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 with @xmath15 .",
    "the particle mass is @xmath16 for dark matter and @xmath17 @xmath7 m@xmath1 for baryonic particles , and we use a maximum gravitational softening of @xmath18 kpc for gas , dark matter and star particles .    at @xmath5",
    "the halo of our galaxy has spin parameter of @xmath19 and it contains @xmath20 dark matter and @xmath21 baryonic particles within the virial radius .",
    "it was selected to have no major mergers since @xmath22 in order to give time for a disk to form . because the selected halo is similar in mass and spin to the milky way and has a relatively quiet merger history in the recent past",
    ", we thus expect this halo to host a disk galaxy .",
    "however , given our incomplete knowledge of galaxy formation processes , this expectation is not necessarily fully correct .",
    "[ simulations_table ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have used a series of simulations of the formation of a galaxy of virial mass @xmath23 m@xmath1 from cosmological initial conditions to study how sn feedback affects the formation of disks .",
    "our simulations have sufficient resolution to resolve the internal structure of the galaxy as well as large - scale processes such as mergers , interactions , infall , tidal stripping , etc .",
    "our study has focussed on the performance of our sn feedback scheme for realistic initial conditions and on the dependence of the results on the input parameters of the feedback model , as well as on the mass of the galaxy . in the following",
    "we summarize our main results .",
    "\\1 ) our model for sn feedack is able to regulate star formation activity by heating and pressurizing gas near star - forming sites .",
    "this is reflected in a bursty behaviour for the sfr when feedback is included , particularly in low - mass systems .",
    "different choices for feedback efficiencies produce variations in the star formation levels and in the detailed shape of the sfr , although qualitatively all our simulations show similar behaviour . when compared with a simulation where sn feedback is neglected , the reduction in the final stellar mass formed can be as high as @xmath24 percent even for a milky way mass object .",
    "\\2 ) efficient regulation of star formation leads to an increase in the final gas fraction , when compared to a simulation where sn feedback is not included .",
    "this , together with substantial mass - loaded galactic winds powered by the sn input , leads to galaxies that , at @xmath5 , have lower baryon fractions .",
    "\\3 ) galaxy morphology is strongly affected by sn feedback .",
    "large disks can be formed and can survive until @xmath5 if energy injection is allowed .",
    "our results indicate that disks can , however , be formed for a wide range of input parameters . the stellar mass in our galaxies is typically dominated by spheroidal components . in the best case",
    ", we found equal masses in the disk and the spheroid .",
    "note , however , that the disk is significantly more luminous since it is significantly younger .",
    "we find the final characteristic size and thickness of disks to depend significantly on the input parameters .",
    "adopting too extreme and unrealistic assumptions for the energy per sn or for the efficiency results in failure to form a disk .",
    "similarly , a simulation with no - feedback also leads to a pure spheroidal stellar component .",
    "\\4 ) disks are rotationally supported , have high specific angular momentum and have a substantial number of young stars .",
    "our disks have typical half - mass formation times of @xmath25 gyr .",
    "in contrast , spheroids are old , with half - mass formation times @xmath26 gyr . in a simulation without feedback",
    "much of the specific angular momentum of the cold component ( the cold gas and stars ) is lost to dynamical friction during the assembly . as a result , no disk forms .",
    "\\5 ) our disks and spheroids have different chemical properties as a result of their different formation histories .",
    "in particular , the stellar halo in our simulations is the most metal - poor component , in agreement with observation , whereas the disk and bulge components have similar near - solar metallicities . without sn feedback",
    "this trend is not recovered and all components show similar , overly high iron abundances .",
    "gas metallicities are also affected by changes in star formation histories and by galactic winds when sn feedback is included .",
    "gas metallicity profiles consistent with observations are only found when feedback is included .",
    "\\6 ) in our model , the effects of sn feedback strongly depend on virial mass .",
    "we have shown this by scaling down one of our simulations by factors of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in mass .",
    "feedback has a much stronger effect in smaller systems , where violent galactic winds eject most of the baryonic material and prevent gas from collapsing to make stars .",
    "sfrs are low and bursty in such systems .",
    "such small galaxies have lower baryon fractions at @xmath5 than larger systems .",
    "our findings show that our model is able to produce realistic disk systems from cosmological initial conditions .",
    "this results from the self - regulation of the star formation process and the heating due to feedback which prevents excessive early condensation of gas into the central regions of dark haloes and the consequent later loss of angular momentum . an important success is the fact that disks are obtained for a variety of input parameters , with realistic radial and vertical sizes , and metallicity structures . in all cases",
    "we find that the spheroids dominate the stellar mass , suggesting that further refinements are needed if we are to understand the formation of late - type spirals .",
