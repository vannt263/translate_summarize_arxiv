    "dark - bright ( db ) solitons constitute exact solutions of the completely integrable , defocusing , two - component manakov model  @xcite , i.e. , the vector variant of the nonlinear schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "these structures exist in the presence of equal nonlinear interactions within and between components . as such",
    ", they can be thought of as symbiotic structures , since the bright components thereof would not be sustainable in defocusing settings , and only emerge because of the effective potential well created by the dark soliton component through the inter - species interaction .",
    "taking advantage of the ratios of inter- and intra - species interactions between bose - condensed hyperfine spin states of atomic @xmath1rb , being very proximal to unity , dark - bright solitons were proposed as being experimentally relevant in atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) already since 2001 @xcite . however ,",
    "this possibility was at a somewhat dormant stage until 2008 , when the hamburg group was able to produce experimentally such coherent structures using phase - imprinting techniques  @xcite , and to illustrate their robustness in @xmath1rb becs .",
    "the above mentioned as well as subsequent efforts revealed a number of exciting characteristics of these nonlinear entities .",
    "for instance , it was shown that db solitary waves oscillate in a trap with a reduced frequency in comparison to their dark single - component counterparts due to the presence of the bright filling component  @xcite .",
    "dark - bright soliton trains were created by inducing counterflow between two miscible becs past a critical velocity  @xcite .",
    "molecules of a few db solitary waves were observed in related experiments , and offered the seed for detailed investigations of the interactions between db solitons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , beating ( in time ) dark - dark solitons , which turn out to be so(2 ) rotated versions of db solitons were also predicted and observed in experiments  @xcite , further adding to the richness of this multi - component setting .",
    "also , the interaction of such states with potential barriers was experimentally explored  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that two - dimensional generalizations of these structures have been considered , both in the context of dark - bright rings  @xcite and in that of vortex - bright solitary waves  @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present work is to present a set of analytical solutions and numerical results both for individual db solitary waves and also for lattices of such waves , for arbitrary nonlinear coefficients ( within suitable bounds ) .",
    "this is relevant for a number of reasons not only theoretically , but also experimentally .",
    "on the one hand , not all atomic species have as nearly equal inter- and intra - species interaction scattering length , as is the case with rubidium .",
    "perhaps even more importantly , the well established now technique of feshbach resonance  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for work in two - component becs ) can be used to detune the nonlinear coefficients from this degenerate case of equal strength and , thus , it is relevant to appreciate the potential robustness ( or lack thereof ) of these nonlinear waves in such settings .",
    "we start by presenting db solitary waves in explicit analytical form and identify the algebraic conditions that need to be satisfied for the relevant solutions to exist .",
    "we solve such algebraic equations for the characteristic properties of the solutions and offer an interpretation of the resulting expressions .",
    "in addition , we extract conditions under which such families of solutions will be possible to sustain .",
    "in addition to identifying the relevant solutions in explicit numerical computations , we are able to more importantly establish their potential existence / robustness in the experimentally relevant setting of trapped binary condensates",
    ". whenever possible , our considerations will be fully analytical .",
    "examples of this type will concern , e.g. , the explicit form of the db solitary waves and their lattices for general coefficients , or the analysis of the motion of a single db for general interactions in the presence of the trap .",
    "however , other aspects of our considerations , such as the stability of the lattices of such waves in either the homogeneous or the trapped state will be developed by numerical methods .",
    "the combination of both types of tools will provide us with a broad understanding of the existence , stability and dynamical properties of the single db solitary waves and their multiple generalizations as a function of the nonlinear inter - atomic interaction strengths .",
    "we should note that although in the bec literature , we are not aware of any investigations along these analytical lines ( the closest analysis which offers numerical borders of existence of single dark - bright solitons consists of the work of  @xcite ) , in the optics literature , there are some similar studies that we now highlight .",
    "firstly , it should be noted that these cases do not consider the framework of a harmonic trap , which is less physically relevant in that context .",
    "a study of db solitary waves for general coefficients has been conducted in the work of  @xcite , while periodic solutions , yet solely for the limit of equal nonlinear interactions were obtained in  @xcite .",
    "our presentation will be structured as follows : in section ii , we will provide the relevant model setup and present the well - known db soliton solutions , as introduced in the manakov limit ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    ". we will also explore lattices of such solitary waves in the homogeneous case near that limit and present our analytical results for the stability / motion of a single db solitary wave in the presence of the trap . in section iii , we present our numerical considerations , confirming the existence of both single and multiple db solitary wave solutions , both in the vicinity , as well as far from the manakov limit , both in the absence , as well as in the presence of the parabolic trap confining the atoms . finally , in section iv , we summarize our findings and propose some challenges for future work .",
    "we commence our analysis by considering a two - component elongated ( along the @xmath2-direction ) repulsive bec , composed of two different hyperfine states of the same alkali isotope .",
    "we focus on the experimentally tractable setting of a highly anisotropic trap , i.e. , the longitudinal and transverse trapping frequencies are such that @xmath3 . in this case , the system at hand can be described at the mean - field level by two coupled gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpes ) of the form @xcite : @xmath4 in this model , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) denote the mean - field wave functions of the two components ( normalized to the numbers of atoms @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is the atomic mass , and @xmath9 are the chemical potentials ; furthermore , @xmath10 are the effective one - dimensional ( 1d ) coupling constants , with @xmath11 denoting the three @xmath12-wave scattering lengths ( @xmath13 ) which account for collisions between atoms belonging to the same ( @xmath14 ) or different ( @xmath15 ) species .",
    "the external trapping potential is parabolic , of the form @xmath16 . introducing normalized densities",

    "we will now illustrate that solitary waves of the db type can in fact be found in an explicit analytical form even outside of the very special integrable regime of @xmath24 , where inverse scattering theory provides such explicit solutions  @xcite . to that effect",
    ", we will consider the analytically tractable case of @xmath25 ( and subsequently illustrate how our results are modified in the presence of a trap ) in eqs .",

    "in particular , it can be directly seen from eq .",

    "we now consider two types of lattice generalizations of the relevant single db soliton solutions . in the first one , the dark solitons generalize into the form of a jacobian elliptic function solution of the sn - type , while the bright solitons generalize into a cn - type solution .",
    "this suggests that the adjacent solitary waves in this structure are out - of - phase with respect to each other . in the second generalization , while the dark solitons preserve the same type of structure , the bright ones are now of the dn - type , amounting to in - phase bright solitons in the second component .      in this case , for the system of eqs .",

    "<S> in the present contribution , we explore a host of different stationary states , namely dark - bright solitons and their lattices , that arise in the context of multi - component atomic bose - einstein condensates . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , are modeled by systems of coupled gross - pitaevskii equations with general interaction ( nonlinearity ) coefficients @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in some particular parameter ranges such solutions can be obtained in analytical form , however , numerically they are computed as existing in a far wider parametric range . </S>",
    "<S> many features of the solutions under study , such as their analytical form without the trap or the stability / dynamical properties of one dark - bright soliton even in the presence of the trap are obtained analytically and corroborated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> additional features , such as the stability of soliton lattice homogeneous states or their existence / stability in the presence of the trap , are examined numerically . </S>"
