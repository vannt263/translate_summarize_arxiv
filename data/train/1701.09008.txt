    "equivalently regularly spaced targets in infinite space  , the full fpt statistics , and in particular its mean , have been derived asymptotically for markovian scale invariant random walkers @xcite . in the last few years",
    "these results have been extended in several directions ; the case of several targets has been analyzed in @xcite , and more recently examples of non scale invariant processes @xcite and non markovian processes have been studied .",
    "this was done first on the example of a monomer of a polymer chain @xcite , and next for more general gaussian processes @xcite , but explicit results beyond the markovian scale invariant case remain rather sparse .    here",
    "we consider the dynamics of an anisotropic ( needle - like ) particle in @xmath0 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) ; this system is of experimental relevance and can be realized by designing ellipsoidal particles or nematic macromolecules @xcite and can model a large class of rod - like bacteria @xcite . on general grounds ,",
    "the brownian motion of such anisotropic particle , which could be of thermal or active origin , combines rotational diffusion of the particle axis , and anisotropic translational diffusion along and orthogonal to the particle axis .",
    "this coupling makes the process @xmath1 of the positions of the particle non markovian , and not scale invariant , even if the full process @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the orientation of the particle , is markovian .",
    "adapting the recent methodology developed in @xcite , we determine in this paper the mfpt @xmath2 of the particle to a target of radius @xmath3 and show in particular that @xmath4 for @xmath5 , in contrast with the classical logarithmic divergence obtained in the case of an isotropic @xmath0 brownian particle , for which it is known that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the initial distance from the target @xcite .",
    "this classical results holds for both targets in the bulk of the domain , or at the boundary of the domain ( so called narrow escape problem ) @xcite .",
    "this logarithmic divergence stems from the fact that the dimension of isotropic brownian motion is 2 .",
    "exploration of the 2-dimensional plane by a brownian particle has henceforth specific properties , and is usually called marginally compact : in absence of confinement , any target of finite size @xmath10 is eventually visited with probability 1 ( recurrence property ) .",
    "in contrast , in any dimension @xmath11 , this probability is strictly smaller than 1 ( transience property ) , and the mfpt in confinement diverges for small target size @xmath3 ; in dimension @xmath12 , a point - like target is found with probability 1 ( recurrence property ) , and the mfpt has a finite limit when @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the 2d diffusion of anisotropic particles , such as ellipsoid particles or more generally nematic particles , can be conveniently defined in the local reference frame of the particle , where the @xmath13 axis is defined by the main axis of the particle at a given time @xmath14 and the @xmath15 axis by its normal .",
    "the position and state of the particle at a later time @xmath16 is then fully defined by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 refer to the position of the center of mass of the particle in the local reference frame and the angle @xmath7 defines its orientation with respect to a fixed axis ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "we now present a more general scaling analysis of the problem , which does not involve the above gaussian approximation of the propagator .",
    "as discussed above , one needs to distinguish the two time regimes @xmath109 of highly anisotropic diffusion and @xmath110 of isotropic diffusion .",

    "first notice that the existence of a finite limit of @xmath116 when @xmath117 , as can be seen from eq.([eqt ] ) , shows that the dependence on the last variable @xmath118 can be ignored ; we consider this limit from now on and identify @xmath119 and its large volume limit .",
    "we analyze the dependence on the target size @xmath3 and fix @xmath120 ; the rescaled mfpt @xmath119 is then a function of @xmath121 only .",
    "this function is expected to diverge for @xmath122 ; qualitatively this comes from the fact that the anisotropic motion results from a constrained @xmath0 brownian motion and can therefore only explore less space ( see below for a more quantitative argument ) . from eq . such divergence comes from the contribution of the first propagator @xmath123 , which only depends on @xmath3 .",

    ". finally , injecting these scalings in eq.([eqt ] ) , one obtains : @xmath132 this analysis , even if it involves assumptions on the scaling of the propagator , is consistent with the analysis of the previous section based on the gaussian approximation of the propagator and yields the correct scaling @xmath133 ; it will be further supported in the next section by numerical simulations . to conclude this general analysis , we extend it to the case of a finite transverse diffusion coefficient @xmath134 , while keeping @xmath135 .",
    "three cases then arise . for @xmath136 ,",
    "the diffusion along @xmath15 can be neglected and the previous analysis can be applied : @xmath137 . in the ultimate regime @xmath138 , the particle behaves as @xmath0 brownian particle , and the usual logarithmic divergence is recovered .",
    "diffusion is however inhomogeneous and the fpt is limited by the transverse motion , so that @xmath139 . in the opposite regime @xmath140 ,",

    "[ fig3 ] shows the mfpt as a function of @xmath103 .",
    "the predicted scaling @xmath144 for small @xmath103 is clearly observed numerically , with a cross over to the isotropic brownian behavior at larger @xmath103 in the case @xmath145 .",
    "we present additionally several examples with @xmath134 , keeping @xmath146 , which display as expected a similar behavior .",
    "however , it should be noted that the numerical prefactor entering the expression of the mfpt , as obtained in eq .",
    "( [ pref ] ) on the basis of the gaussian approximation , is not quantitatively accurate .",
    "this is due to the fact that the propagator is not exactly gaussian , as can be checked numerically .",

    "in conclusion , we have presented in this paper a theoretical analysis of the mfpt to spherical target for an anisotropic diffusive particle in a @xmath0 confined domain . on the basis of scaling arguments , a gaussian approximation and numerical methods , we have determined the mfpt @xmath2 and put forward an unexpected scaling with the target size @xmath4 for @xmath5 , which is in contrast with the classical logarithmic divergence obtained in the case of an isotropic @xmath0 brownian particle .",
    "this stronger divergence of the mfpt for small target sizes can be attributed to a much slower exploration of space at short time scales for the anisotropic particle : as discussed above , at short times ( @xmath153 ) the anisotropic particle explores a typical area @xmath154 , much smaller than the area @xmath155 explored by a @xmath0 isotropic brownian particle .",
    "since it is expected that the distribution of the first - passage time is in this case asymptotically exponential , we anticipate that this quantity allows for a complete description of the search kinetics @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this non trivial scaling of the mfpt with the target size can not be directly inferred from the general results derived in @xcite for scale invariant processes ; the process is here not scale invariant and a single walk dimension can not a priori be defined . while this work focuses on a rather simple model of anisotropic diffusion , we believe that it also puts forward tools applicable to further examples of anisotropic processes , which lack the scale invariance property",
    ". it also provides an explicit example of determination of the mfpt for a non markovian process ( @xmath156 alone ) , which is amenable to a markovian process by taking into account additional degrees of freedom ( @xmath157 ) . in particular",
    "this analysis illustrates that the specific functional form of the propagator can be irrelevant to determine scaling behaviors , provided that relevant rescaled variables are properly defined ."
