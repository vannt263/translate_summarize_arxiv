    "with the basic idea being able to be traced back to @xcite , problems of distributed consensus seeking have been widely studied in the past decade sparked by the work of @xcite .",
    "the states of a group of interconnected nodes can asymptotically reach the average value of their initial states via neighboring node interactions and simple distributed control rule @xcite , which forms a foundational block for the further development in the broad range of control of network systems @xcite .",
    "the understanding of distributed consensus algorithms has been substantially advanced in aspects ranging from convergence speed optimisation and directed links to switching interactions and nonlinear dynamics @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recent work @xcite brought the idea of distributed averaging consensus to quantum networks , where each node corresponds to a qubit , i.e. , a quantum bit @xcite . in quantum mechanics , the state of a qubit",
    "is represented by a density matrix over a two - dimensional hilbert space @xmath0 , and the state of a quantum network with @xmath1 qubits corresponds to a density matrix over the @xmath1th tensor product of @xmath0 .",
    "the concepts regarding the network density matrix reaching a quantum consensus were systematically developed in @xcite , and it has been shown that a quantum consensus can be reached with the help of quantum swapping operators for both continuous - time and discrete - time dynamics @xcite . in fact , the two categories of dynamics over classical and quantum networks can be put together into a group - theoretic framework @xcite , and quantum consensus dynamics can even be equivalently mapped into some parallel classical dynamics over disjoint subsets of the entries of the network density matrix@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we make an attempt to look at the relation between the two categories of dynamics from a _ physical _ perspective , despite their various consistencies already shown in @xcite .",
    "the density matrix describes a quantum system in a mixed state that is a statistical ensemble of several quantum states , analogous to the probability distribution function of a random variable @xcite .",
    "first of all we investigate the evolution of the network entropy for consensus dynamics in classical or quantum networks .",
    "we show that in classical consensus dynamics , the network entropy decreases at the consensus limit if the node initial values are i.i.d .",
    "bernoulli random variables , and the network differential entropy is monotonically non - increasing if the node initial values are i.i.d . gaussian . while for the quantum consensus dynamics , the network s von neumann entropy is in contrast non - decreasing .",
    "these observations suggest that the two types of consensus schemes may have different physical footings .",
    "then , we compare several gossiping algorithms with random or deterministic coefficients for classical or quantum networks and present novel convergence conditions for gossiping algorithms with random coefficients .",
    "the result shows that quantum gossiping algorithms with deterministic coefficients are physically consistent with classical gossiping algorithms with random coefficients .",
