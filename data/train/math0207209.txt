    "turbo codes[1 ] have an impressive near - shannon - limit error correcting performance .",
    "the superior performance of turbo codes over convolutional codes is achieved only when the length of the interleaver is very large , on the order of several thousand bits . for large block size interleavers ,",
    "most random interleavers perform well . on the other hand , for some applications it is preferable to have a deterministic interleaver , to reduce the hardware requirements for interleaving and de - interleaving operations .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to propose a deterministic interleaver design to address this problem . for short interleavers ,",
    "the performance of the turbo code with a random interleaver degrades substantially up to a point where its bit error rate ( ber ) performance is worse than the ber performance of convolutional codes with similar computational complexity . for short block length interleavers , selection of the interleaver",
    "has a significant effect on the performance of the turbo code . in many applications such as voice",
    ", delay is an important issue in choosing the block size . for these applications ,",
    "there is a need to design short block size interleavers that demonstrate acceptable ber performance .",
    "several authors have suggested interleaver designs for turbo codes suitable for short block sizes [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "there are two major criteria in the design of an interleaver : 1 ) the distance spectrum properties ( weight distribution ) of the code , and 2 ) the correlation between the soft output of each decoder corresponding to its parity bits and the information input data sequence .",
    "criterion 2 ) is sometimes referred to as the iterative decoding suitability ( ids ) criterion [ 2 ] .",
    "this is a measure of the effectiveness of the iterative decoding algorithm and the fact that if these two data sequences are less correlated , then the performance of the iterative decoding algorithm improves .",
    "the performance of turbo codes at low ber is mainly dominated by the minimum effective free distance ( @xmath0)[13,16 ] .",
    "it has been shown [ 6 ] that the turbo code asymptotic performance approaches the @xmath0 asymptote .",
    "the noise floor that occurs at moderate to high signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) is the result of small @xmath0 [ 6 ] .",
    "the noise floor can be lowered by increasing either the interleaver size or @xmath0 .",
    "the latter can be achieved by appropriate choice of interleaver . in our approach",
    ", maximizing @xmath0 is a goal in designing the interleaver .",
    "performance evaluation of turbo codes is usually based on the assumption that the receiver is a maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoder .",
    "however , turbo codes actually use a sub - optimal iterative algorithm .",
    "a soft output decoding algorithm such as maximum a posteriori probability ( map)[7 ] is used in the iterative algorithm .",
    "the performance of the iterative decoding improves if the information that is sent to each decoder from the other decoders is less correlated with the input information data sequence .",
    "hokfelt et al .",
    "[ 2 ] proposed the ids criterion for designing an interleaver . in the interleaver design proposed here ,",
    "we recommend the use of the ids criterion with some modifications .",
    "trellis termination of turbo codes is critical , especially when the interleaver is designed to maximize @xmath0 . if this problem is not addressed in the design of the interleaver , it can lead to a very small value for @xmath0 because of the existence of data sequences with no trellis termination and low output weight , resulting in a degradation in the performance of the turbo code . papers [ 8 - 10 ] have addressed this question .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect2 ]",
    "random and s - random interleavers [ 11 ] are described .",
    "our approach is based on s - random interleavers .",
    "the ids [ 2 ] criterion is also briefly discussed . in section [ sect3 ] , a two - step s - random interleaver design is presented .",
    "our approach requires knowing which polynomials are divisible by a primitive polynomial ; this question is addressed in the appendix .",
    "section [ sect4 ] describes a deterministic interleaver design based on the results from section [ sect3 ] .",
    "we conclude the paper by comparing the ber performance of turbo codes utilizing our interleaver design to other interleavers .",
    "an interleaver @xmath1 is a permutation @xmath2 that changes the order of a data sequence of @xmath3 input symbols @xmath4 . if the input data sequence is @xmath5 $ ] , then the permuted data sequence is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an interleaving matrix with a single 1 in each row and column , all other entries being zero .",
    "every interleaver has a corresponding de - interleaver @xmath8 that acts on the interleaved data sequence and restores it to its original order .",
    "the de - interleaving matrix is simply the transpose of the interleaving matrix ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "a random interleaver is simply a random permutation @xmath1 . for large values of @xmath3",
    ", most random interleavers utilized in turbo codes perform well .",
    "however , as the interleaver block size decreases , the performance of a turbo code degrades substantially , up to a point when its ber performance is worse than that of a convolutional code with similar computational complexity .",
    "thus the design of short interleavers for turbo codes is an important problem [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "an @xmath10-random interleaver ( where @xmath11 ) is a `` semi - random '' interleaver constructed as follows .",
    "each randomly selected integer is compared with @xmath10 previously selected random integers .",
    "if the difference between the current selection and s previous selections is smaller than s , the random integer is rejected .",
    "this process is repeated until @xmath3 distinct integers have been selected .",
    "computer simulations have shown that if @xmath12 , then this process converges [ 11 ] in a reasonable time .",
    "this interleaver design assures that short cycle events are avoided .",
    "a short cycle event occurs when two bits are close to each other both before and after interleaving .",
    "a new interleaver design was recently proposed based on the performance of iterative decoding in turbo codes [ 2 ] .",
    "turbo codes utilize an iterative decoding process based on the map or other algorithms that can provide a soft output . at each decoding step",
    ", some information related to the parity bits of one decoder is fed into the other decoder together with the systematic data sequence and the parity bits corresponding to that decoder .",
    "figure 1 shows this iterative decoding scheme .",
    "the inputs to each decoder are the input data sequence , @xmath13 , the parity bits @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and the logarithm of the likelihood ratio ( llr ) associated with the parity bits from the other decoder ( @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) , which is used as _ a priori _ information .",
    "all these inputs are utilized by the decoder to create three outputs corresponding to the weighted version of these inputs . in figure 1 , @xmath18 represents the weighted version of the input data sequence , @xmath13 .",
    "also @xmath19 in the same figure demonstrates the fact that the input data sequence is fed into the second decoder after interleaving .",
    "the input to each decoder from the other decoder is used as _ a priori _ information in the next decoding step and corresponds to the weighted version of the parity bits .",
    "this information will be more effective in the performance of iterative decoding if it is less correlated with the input data sequence ( or interleaved input data sequence ) .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to use this as a criterion for designing the interleaver . for large block size interleavers ,",
    "most random interleavers provide a low correlation between @xmath20 and input data sequence , @xmath13 .",
    "the correlation coefficient , @xmath21 , is defined as the correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it has been shown [ 2 ] that @xmath21 can be analytically approximated by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constants that depend on the encoder feedback and feedforward polynomials .",
    "the correlation coefficient at the output of the second decoder , @xmath27 , is approximated by @xmath28 where the two terms in the right hand side of ( 2 ) correspond to the correlation coefficients between @xmath29 and the input data , i.e. , @xmath30 and @xmath31 [ 2 ] . in our notation",
    ", @xmath32 represents the correlation coefficient matrix and @xmath33 represents one element of this matrix .",
    "similar correlation coefficients can be computed for the de - interleaver .",
    "the correlation matrix corresponding to de - interleaver , @xmath34 , is the same as ( 2 ) except that @xmath7 is replaced by @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath36 is defined to be @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xmath39 is defined in a similar way using @xmath40 .",
    "the iterative decoding suitability ( ids ) measure is then defined as @xmath41 a low value of ids is an indication that the correlation properties between @xmath31 and @xmath30 are equally spread along the data sequence of length n. an interleaver design based on the ids condition is proposed in [ 12 ] .",
    "a new interleaver design , a two - step s - random interleaver , is presented here . the goal is to increase the minimum effective free distance , @xmath0 , of the turbo code while decreasing or at least not increasing the correlation properties between the information input data sequence and @xmath20 .",
    "hokfelt et al .",
    "[ 2,12 ] introduced the ids criterion to evaluate the correlation properties .",
    "the two vectors for the computation of ids in ( 5 ) are very similar and for most interleavers .",
    "thus it is sufficient to only use one of them , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "instead we can define a new criterion based on decreasing the correlation coefficients for the third decoding step , i.e. , the correlation coefficients between extrinsic information from the second decoder and information input data sequence . in this regard ,",
    "the new correlation coefficient matrix , @xmath34 , is defined as @xmath43 @xmath44 can now be computed in a similar way to ( 3 ) by using ( 6 ) .",
    "the new iterative decoding suitability ( @xmath45 ) is then defined as @xmath46 a small value for @xmath45 only guarantees that the correlation properties are spread equally throughout the data sequence .",
    "however , this criterion does not attempt to reduce the power of correlation coefficients , i.e. , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . therefore , we recommend the following additional condition as a second iterative decoding suitability criterion : @xmath49 we then use the average of these two values as a new ids criterion , namely @xmath50 minimizing ( 9 ) is then one of our goals in optimizing the interleaver .    as we described earlier , s - random interleavers avoid short cycle events .",
    "this property guarantees that two bits close to each other before interleaving will have a minimum distance of s after interleaving .",
    "more specifically , for information input data @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and permuted data @xmath53 and @xmath54 , an s - random interleaver will guarantee that if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 .",
    "however , this does not exclude the possibility that @xmath57 , which can degrade the performance of iterative decoding of turbo codes for this particular bit . the larger the distance between @xmath52 and @xmath54 , the smaller the correlation between the information input data sequence and @xmath20 .",
    "we therefore introduce an additional measure , @xmath58 , which is defined to be the minimum permissible distance between @xmath52 and @xmath54 for all @xmath59 .    unlike [ 12 ] , where the interleaver design is based just on the ids criterion ,",
    "our interleaver is designed in two stages . in the first stage , we design an interleaver that satisfies the s - random criterion together with the @xmath58 condition . in the second stage , we try to increase the minimum effective free distance ( @xmath0 ) of the turbo code while considering the @xmath60 constraint .",
    "the design is as follows .",
    "we begin by selecting some values for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . + * step 1 * : each randomly selected integer @xmath53 is compared with the previous selections @xmath54 to check that if @xmath63 then @xmath64 .",
    "we also insist that @xmath1 must satisfy @xmath65 .",
    "+ besides the above conditions , the last @xmath66 tail bits used for trellis termination in the first decoder are chosen to satisfy @xmath67 , and if @xmath68 with @xmath69 then @xmath70 .",
    "this condition will guarantee that trellis termination for the first decoder is sufficient and there will not be any low weight sequence at the output of the second decoder caused by failure of trellis termination . + * step 2 * : choose the maximum pre - determined weight @xmath71 for input data sequences and the minimum permissible effective free distance of the code @xmath72 . find all input data sequences of length n and weight @xmath73 and their corresponding effective free distance @xmath74 for the turbo encoder with an interleaver design based on step 1 such that @xmath75 .",
    "all these input data sequences are divisible before and after interleaving by the feedback polynomial ( usually a primitive polynomial ) of the turbo encoder .",
    "consider the first input data block of weight @xmath76 with non - zero elements in locations @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "compute @xmath60 based on ( 9 ) for the original interleaver designed in step 1 .",
    "set @xmath79 and find the pair @xmath80 .",
    "interchange the interleaver pairs @xmath81 and @xmath80 to create a new interleaver , i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "compute the new ids , @xmath84 , based on the new interleaver design . if @xmath85 , replace the interleaver by the new one .",
    "otherwise , set @xmath86 and continue .",
    "repeat this operation for all input data sequences with a minimum weight of @xmath73 and @xmath75 . after completing this operation , return to step 2 and find all input data sequences of weight @xmath73 with @xmath87 for the new interleaver .",
    "continue this step until it converges and there is no input data sequence of weight @xmath73 with @xmath87 .",
    "obviously if @xmath72 is too large , the second step may never converge , and in this case @xmath72 should be reduced .",
    "an interleaver design proposed in [ 14 ] and [ 15 ] is based on the joint s - random criteria and elimination of all error patterns of weight @xmath88 .",
    "however , in practice the joint optimization criteria will not converge easily and therefore the value of @xmath10 must be reduced and @xmath88 restricted to only weight two inputs . for weights larger than two ,",
    "the convergence of the algorithm is a problem because of the large number of possibilities . by separating these two criteria into two steps",
    ", we can easily find the appropriate interleaver satisfying each step separately .",
    "the two steps in the two - step s - random interleaver design are independent operations .",
    "the second step tries to increase the minimum effective free distance of the code ( based on the interleaver design in the first step ) to a pre - determined value ( @xmath72 ) , while attempting not to increase the correlation between the information input data and the soft output of each decoder corresponding to its parity bits . obviously , if @xmath72 is set to too large a value , the second stage of the design may completely change the interleaver produced by the first step and produce an inferior design .",
    "this possibility will be illustrated later by simulation .",
    "it is shown in [ 13 ] that the feedback polynomials for the recursive systematic convolutional encoder of turbo codes should be chosen to be primitive polynomials .",
    "when used for turbo codes , primitive polynomials exhibit better spectrum distance properties .",
    "the appendix describes how to find all input data sequences of weight @xmath71 that are divisible by a primitive polynomial .",
    "this information is required for the second step in our approach .",
    "the following theorem describes a deterministic interleaver based on step 1 in the previous section .",
    "let @xmath89 and @xmath3 be relatively prime natural numbers such that @xmath90 divides @xmath3 , and let @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "then there is a permutation @xmath93 such that ( a )  if @xmath94 and @xmath95 then @xmath96 , and ( b )  for all @xmath51 , @xmath97 .",
    "* proof : * let @xmath98 and define @xmath99 by @xmath100 , where @xmath53 is to be interpreted as the number @xmath101 that is congruent to @xmath102 modulo @xmath3 . since @xmath103 , @xmath1 is indeed a permutation .",

    "but @xmath120 so @xmath121 , which means @xmath122 is trapped between two successive multiples of @xmath3 , namely @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "therefore @xmath125 again we show both terms are @xmath114",
    ". since we are in case ( ii ) , @xmath126 .",
    "secondly , @xmath127 .",
    "( b )  let @xmath128 .",
    "then @xmath129 since @xmath90 divides @xmath3 , and @xmath98 , the last expression is at least @xmath130 .",
    "+ to maximize the constants @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the number @xmath131 should be close to @xmath132",
    ". then @xmath61 is also about @xmath132 .",
    "the following elementary consideration shows that one can not achieve @xmath133 : assume that @xmath134 . then the @xmath135 values @xmath136 have pairwise distance @xmath137 .",
    "therefore the ` balls ' with radius @xmath138 cover the @xmath139 numbers @xmath140 completely .",
    "so theorem 1 yields a solution where @xmath61 is already optimal .    in some applications such as wireless systems in rayleigh fading channels",
    ", it has been suggested that an additional interleaver be incorporated either before the first encoder or in the path of the systematic data sequence , or alternatively over the entire data sequence ( both the systematic data and the parity bits ) in order to improve the performance of the system [ 17 ] .",
    "the deterministic interleaver proposed here can be used for these applications without adding too much complexity to the system .",

    "for the s - random interleaver , the value of @xmath10 is 9 . from figure",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] it can be concluded that the new interleaver design performs much better than other interleavers at low ber .",
    "it is also obvious that the error floor for turbo codes is much lower with the new interlearver design because of the larger value of @xmath0 .",
    "this figure also shows that choosing a very large value for @xmath72 can degrade the performance of the turbo code . for this particular example , the two - step s - random interleaver with @xmath147 performs better than that with @xmath148 .",
    "the appropriate maximum value for @xmath72 depends on the length of the interleaver and it is usually obtained by trial and simulations .",

    "the two - step s - random interleaver has much better ber performance than the s - random interleaver at low ber and results in a lower error floor for turbo codes . in practice , because the correlation properties of the input data and the parity information are decreasing exponentially , it is sufficient to choose a small value for @xmath62 .    we have also compared the two - step s - random interleaver with hokfelt s interleaver design .",

    "<S> the performance of a turbo code with short block length depends critically on the interleaver design . </S>",
    "<S> there are two major criteria in the design of an interleaver : the distance spectrum of the code and the correlation between the information input data and the soft output of each decoder corresponding to its parity bits . </S>",
    "<S> this paper describes a new interleaver design for turbo codes with short block length based on these two criteria . </S>",
    "<S> a deterministic interleaver suitable for turbo codes is also described . </S>",
