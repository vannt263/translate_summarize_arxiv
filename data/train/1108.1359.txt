    "this linear code has parameters @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 denotes , as usual , the minimum hamming distance of the code .",
    "depending on the situation , @xmath16 ( denoted with @xmath1 ) will be called _ the minimum distance of the matrix @xmath17 _ , or _ the minimum distance of the fat point scheme @xmath2_.    note that in the matrix @xmath17 , if we replace a column @xmath14 with any of its ( nonzero ) scalar multiples , or if we permute in any way the columns of @xmath17 , the parameters of this linear code do not change . as a consequence of this simple observation one can create a fat point scheme @xmath2 from any generating matrix of any linear code , by identifying the columns of this matrix with points ( fat points , if some columns are proportional ) in a projective space .",
    "hansen @xcite , gold , little , and schenck @xcite and the first author @xcite took this approach in the case when @xmath2 is reduced ( i.e. , @xmath18 , or the generating matrix has no proportional columns ) to obtain bounds on the minimum distance using homological algebra .",
    "in particular , it was shown ( @xcite ) that the minimum distance @xmath16 can be bounded below in terms of the graded shifts appearing in the graded minimal free resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "the lower bounds of @xmath20 can be interpreted as upper bounds for the corresponding homological invariants of @xmath2 ; our main goal is to consider the same problem , but we drop the condition that @xmath2 is reduced .",

    "we are abusing terminology slightly in the above definition . since @xmath23 is a cohen - macaulay ring of dimension @xmath28 , we can find a linear form @xmath29 that is a non - zero divisor on @xmath23 .",
    "then , the ring @xmath30 is an artinian ring .",
    "the socle of this ring is @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "the socle is an ideal of @xmath33 ; it can be shown that the degrees of the minimal generators of this ideal are encoded into the graded shifts at the end of the graded minimal resolution of @xmath23 , but shifted by @xmath34 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we call @xmath35 the minimum socle degree to recognize this connection .",
    "when @xmath2 is reduced , the homological lower bounds for the minimum distance mentioned above are expressed in terms of the minimum socle degree , that is , @xmath36 one can observe that the minimum distance puts constraints on the shifts in the graded minimal free resolution of @xmath2 : @xmath37 .",

    "nevertheless , in @xcite it is shown that @xmath38 is attained for a family of examples due to j. migliore .",
    "the goal of this paper is to obtain similar constraints for the graded minimal free resolution of a fat point scheme .",
    "once we add multiplicities to the points , even when the support is as nice as possible ( e.g. , complete intersection ) , the shifts in the resolution change with no visible pattern .    in this paper , we take the point - of - view of describing how @xmath1 , the minimum distance of a linear code constructed from @xmath2 , can be used to bound homological invariants of @xmath3 .",
    "one could invert this point - of - view by studying how homological invariants are related to the minimum distance , and linear codes in general .",
    "the references @xcite took this second approach .",

    "the invariant considered is @xmath41 , the minimal degree of a generator of @xmath3 . in section 3",
    "we present our main result , theorem [ maintheorem ] , which gives an upper bound for the minimum socle degree of the fat points scheme in terms of the minimum distance of its support .",
    "the main tool used is the machinery of separators of fat points developed in @xcite . in section 4 ,",

    "if @xmath386 and @xmath387 are the corresponding matrices ( i.e. , the columns of these matrices will be given by the homogeneous coordinates in the algebraic closure of @xmath4 of the points ) , we see from remark [ geometric ] , that @xmath388 , and @xmath389 .    indeed the bound in theorem [ maintheorem ] , with @xmath390 , is satisfied for both cases , that is , @xmath391 for @xmath392 .",
