    "furthermore , in a series of other experiments , it has become possible to trap atoms in annular / toroidal traps , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite .    motivated by the above experiments , we investigate the lowest - energy states that appear in a spin - orbit - coupled bose - einstein - condensed cloud of atoms that is trapped in an annular potential , using the mean - field approximation .",
    "a lot of work has been done in homogeneous @xcite and in harmonically - trapped systems @xcite . in the presence of an annular potential",
    ", however , this problem becomes surprisingly challenging .",
    "as we show below , even in the absence of interactions the eigenvalue problem due to the spin - orbit coupling is non - trivial .",
    "we proceed in three steps : first of all , we ignore the interactions and consider the case of a very tight annulus , developing an effectively one - dimensional theory . within this model",
    "we integrate over the transverse degrees of freedom , which not only simplifies the problem numerically , but it also gives some additional insight into the properties of the system .",
    "furthermore ( sec.iii ) , the resulting equations have some limiting analytic solutions .",
    "we then solve the eigenvalue problem in an annulus of a finite width ( sec.iv ) .",
    "the interactions are incorporated in the last step ( sec.v ) .",
    "we pay special attention to the interplay between the ( single - particle ) effect of spin - orbit coupling and the atom - atom interactions ; we stress that the parameters that are associated with both of them are realistic and controllable experimentally in atomic systems .",
    "we consider a bose - einstein - condensed cloud of atoms , confined to two dimensions .",
    "thus , the single - particle hamiltonian of the system is @xmath0 .",
    "\\label{hamilt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the external confining potential has the form of an annular potential , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the radial coordinate , @xmath3 is the atom mass , @xmath4 is the frequency of the potential , and @xmath5 is the mean radius of the annulus .",
    "the term @xmath6 associated with the spin - orbit coupling that we consider here is the one that corresponds to the experiments of the spielman group @xcite . in this case",
    "the so - called rashba - like and dresselhaus - like spin - orbit contributions have an equal strength , and thus @xmath6 takes the one - dimensional form @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the wavenumber of the raman laser beams , @xmath9 is the linear momentum of the atoms in the @xmath10 direction , @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) are the pauli matrices , @xmath13 is the rabi frequency and @xmath14 is the detuning .",
    "the experimental studies of spin - orbit coupling generally choose small values of @xmath14 @xcite and thus we ignore the corresponding term in what follows below .",
    "furthermore , we here orient the spin axes as in ref.@xcite , but most recent theoretical work @xcite uses a cyclic spin rotation @xmath15 , etc . therefore , the system is described as an effective pseudo - spin-1/2 , and the condensate wave function is written as a two - component vector @xmath16^t$ ] (  up \" and  down \" ) .",
    "the interactions are modelled via a short - ranged @xmath17-wave potential of the form @xmath18 while in general there are three different interaction strengths between the  up \" and  down \" components , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , in the present problem we set @xmath22 and tune the ratio @xmath23 ( both assumed to be positive ) .",

    ", the density distribution of the gas may be either striped , or homogeneous @xcite .",
    "this is determined by the ratio between @xmath33 and the recoil energy @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "if the ratio @xmath35 is smaller or larger than unity , the system is in the striped , or in the homogeneous phase , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the expectation value of @xmath6 in some state @xmath16^t$ ] is @xmath36 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath37 is constant .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath13 is spatially - independent and is responsible for the population imbalance between the two components .",
    "the most  interesting \" is the spatially - dependent term , which is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "it is this term that gives rise to the striped phase .",
    "for very strong transverse confinement , the atoms reside in the ground state associated with the transverse degrees of freedom for motion along the annulus .",

    "expanding the eigenfunctions in the basis of the plane - wave states , we have also solved the eigenvalue problem numerically .",
    "the eigenfunctions of lowest energy have the general form @xmath66 and @xmath67 , or vice versa , i.e. , with @xmath44 exchanged with @xmath45 . from these expressions",
    "some generic features follow for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which are also valid for the solutions found in eqs.([an1 ] ) and ( [ an2 ] ) : ( i ) these solutions are even ( the hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation @xmath68 and thus the eigenstates are parity eigenstates ) .",
    "( ii ) the density @xmath69 has nodes at @xmath70 and @xmath71 , while at the same points @xmath72 has maxima , or vice versa .",
    "( iii ) the periodicity of @xmath44 is @xmath73 and of @xmath45 it is @xmath74 , or vice versa .",
    "( iv ) finally , the density of both components has a periodicity of @xmath73 .",
    "turning to the degeneracy of these solutions , the lowest - energy eigenstates are even .",
    "for all current experiments , the laser beam has a wavelength of order 1 @xmath29 m , which means that @xmath75 ( @xmath29m)@xmath76 .",
    "for a typical value of @xmath77 @xmath29 m , @xmath52 is thus at least 10 , or larger . in the typical limiting case @xmath78 , the system is in the striped - like phase ,",
    "the density variations are located around opposite ends of the ring , while the density effectively vanishes elsewhere [ see , e.g. , fig .",
    "1(e ) ] . there is thus a corresponding antisymmetric solution which becomes nearly degenerate with the symmetric one in this limit ( with a corresponding two - fold degeneracy ) .",
    "in addition , the transformation @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 leaves the eigenvalue problem unaffected .",
    "this gives rise to another two - fold ( near ) degeneracy for  small \" @xmath13 , which is exact for @xmath82 .",
    "the physical picture that emerges from the above calculation is that for @xmath53 ( and any value of @xmath13 ) , i.e. , for sufficiently small values of @xmath8 and/or of @xmath5 , as well as for @xmath83 , i.e. , for sufficiently small @xmath8 and/or large values of @xmath13 and/or large values of @xmath5 , the density variation of both components is sinusoidal .",
    "as @xmath52 increases ( with all the other parameters fixed ) , the two components start to localize around @xmath70 and @xmath84 , with a pronounced density variation around these two points , which is the analogue of the striped phase .",
    "this transition is seen in fig.1 , where we plot the one - dimensional density of the two components for an increasing value of @xmath8 , @xmath85 ( a ) , 1.5 ( b ) and 1.6 ( c ) , 2.8 ( d ) , and 6 ( e ) , and for a fixed value of @xmath86 .",
    "the population imbalance also decreases with increasing @xmath8 , since the term in the hamiltonian that is proportional to @xmath13 becomes smaller compared to the one that is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "it is also remarkable that an increase of the value of @xmath52 of less than a factor of two results in a rather dramatic change in the density distribution of the two components , as seen , e.g. , between figs.1 ( b ) and 1 ( c ) .",
    "as we show also below , this indicates a very rich structure , which is a generic feature of this problem .    in the first panel",
    "( a ) of fig.2 we have plotted the density @xmath87 are the eigensolutions of eqs.([eig123 ] ) .",
    "the parameters we have chosen are the ones which correspond to the results shown in the lower panels of fig.2 , namely @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 ( first column ) , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath91 ( second column ) , and finally @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath91 ( third column ) .",
    "panel ( a ) of fig.2 also serves as a reference to the lower panels which show solutions of the two - dimensional problem , as we discuss in the following section .",
    "we now investigate the effect of the finiteness of the width of the annulus , still in the absence of interactions . in this case , the width of the annulus ( the oscillator length @xmath41 ) provides an extra length scale , which is a fraction of @xmath5 . for a narrow annulus ( @xmath43 )",
    "one goes back to the problem of quasi - one - dimensional motion discussed above .",
    "when @xmath94 then the problem reduces to that of a harmonic trapping potential @xcite with a small  hole \" in the center of the trap .",
    "the most interesting case is thus the intermediate one when @xmath95 .",
    "we show in panel ( b ) of fig.2 the two - dimensional density distribution of the two components that we have obtained numerically using the method of imaginary - time propagation ( for the details of this calculation see the appendix ) , considering an annular potential with @xmath96 and some representative values of @xmath8 and @xmath13 . in the first column , of  small \" @xmath8 , @xmath90",
    ", there is a large population imbalance between the two components  here @xmath97 .",
    "while the  up \" component has a pronounced axial asymmetry , the dominant  down \" component also lacks axial symmetry with the maximum of the density being at @xmath98 and @xmath73 ( which is very weak , and is hardly visible in the plot ) . in the second column with a  large \" value of @xmath8 , @xmath91 ,",
    "both components show a striped phase and have an almost equal population ; here @xmath99 .",
    "finally the phase shown in the third column with @xmath100 and @xmath91 resembles in a sense the phase with a sinusoidal density distribution found within the quasi - one - dimensional model , with a large population imbalance ( here @xmath101 ) .",
    "having established a rather complete picture about the single - particle eigenvalue problem , we now turn to the effect of the interactions . in a homogeneous system",
    "when @xmath102 the striped phase ( where also the density minima / maxima of the one component coincide with the maxima / minima of the other ) is energetically more favourable , since this configuration minimizes the overlap between the two components [ due to the last term in eq.([avb ] ) below ] .",
    "this may be seen if one writes the interaction energy in the following form @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the total density .",
    "according to the numerical results that we have obtained using the method of imaginary - time propagation , when @xmath105 the interactions ",
    "combine \" with the ( spatially dependent ) term of the spin - orbit hamiltonian that is proportional to @xmath8 ( and favours the formation of stripes , as we argued earlier ) .",
    "both terms make it energetically favourable for the system to form a striped - like phase ( similar to the one that we described in the case of an annular potential with spin - orbit coupling , but without interactions ) .",
    "panel ( c ) of fig.2 shows @xmath72 and @xmath69 , for @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , or @xmath108 in the first column and @xmath109 in the second and in the third column . while in the first two columns the density is slightly affected by the interactions [ i.e. , as compared to the density in fig.2 ( b ) ] , in the third column the interactions expand the two components more around the annulus .    in panel ( d ) of fig.2",
    "we have chosen @xmath110 .",
    "the first column indicates that the density is not affected drastically by the interactions .",
    "on the other hand , in the second column we see that the density is essentially axially symmetric , in contrast to the striped - like phase , which is seen in the absence of interactions in the second column of panel ( b ) .",
    "thus , this phase is strongly affected by the interactions .    at this point",
    "it is interesting to make contact between the results of fig.2 and those of no trapping potential . as we mentioned also above , in the absence of interactions when the ratio @xmath111 is smaller or larger than unity ,",
    "the system is in the striped , or in the homogeneous phase , respectively @xcite .",
    "the actual value of this ratio is 50 ( first column ) , 0.08 ( second column ) , and 0.8 ( third column ) . according to the above criterion ,",
    "the first and the second columns of fig.2 ( b ) are in the homogeneous and in the striped phases , respectively , which is consistent with our data . for the interacting problem ,",
    "the critical value for the ratio @xmath35 is @xmath112 in this case @xcite .",
    "therefore , the first and the third columns of fig.2(c ) and ( d ) are clearly in the homogeneous phase , which again is consistent with our data .    in the third column of fig.2 ( d )",
    "we show a solution of nonzero circulation , which is only possible in the presence of interactions and for a wide enough annulus . for the same data",
    ", fig.3 shows the phase of the two order parameters along with the corresponding density . as seen in this plot",
    ", there are two phase singularities in the  down \" component and three in the  up \" . in the  down",
    "\" component the corresponding vortices reside in the central region of exponentially small density , while in the  up \" component one of the three is in the central region and two in the region of nonzero density ( for this reason the deviation of the density of the  up \" component from axial symmetry is more pronounced than that of the  down \" component ) .",
    "for the same reason , while all the other plots of fig.2 have a mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath10 axis , this symmetry is broken .",
    "we should also mention that the sense of circulation of the state of the third column of fig.2 ( d ) is determined by the initial condition that is given in the ( iterative ) method of imaginary - time propagation .",
    "furthermore , with a  mean \" density @xmath113 , for the healing length @xmath114 that corresponds to the coupling constant @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , @xmath114 is roughly one half of the width of the annulus , since @xmath41 sets this scale .",
    "clearly these length scales play a crucial role , since the vortex states we have found have to  fit \" within the annulus and this becomes possible provided that the width of the annulus is wide enough , i.e. , it is comparable , or larger than the coherence length @xmath114 .",
    "the vortex states we have found in fig.3 involve two large parameters : rabi coupling @xmath117 and raman wavenumber @xmath91 , as well and the important effect of interactions with @xmath118 .",
    "each of these plays an important role , since the vortex states appear only in the right column of fig.2(d ) .",
    "as seen in fig.3 , there are persistent currents in both the upper component ( arising from the phase singularity in the central region ) and the lower component ( arising from the two phase singularities in the central region ) .",
    "in addition , the upper component has two vortices in the annular region with finite number density .",
    "such states @xcite have the potential to serve as cold - atom analogs of ring currents and definitely merit further more detailed investigation .",
    "spin - orbit coupled bose - einstein - condensed atoms confined in an annular potential show a variety of phases as a result of the ( single - particle effect of the ) spin - orbit coupling and of the ( many - body effect of the ) coupling between the two atoms , while the non - trivial topology of the annular potential is another novel aspect of the problem that we have solved .",
    "figure 1 summarizes the results for the solutions of the eigenvalue problem in the case of a very narrow annulus , as @xmath8 increases ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the homogeneous phase that is present in an untrapped system is replaced by a sinusoidal density variation in the case of a very narrow annulus , which evolves continuously into a striped - like phase as @xmath8 increases . as the width of the annulus increases ,",
    "this picture persists qualitatively , as seen in fig.2 , where interactions have also been included .",
    "depending on the relative strength of @xmath115 and @xmath119 the interactions either favor the striped phase , or suppress it , while they may also give rise to nonlinear solutions with a nonzero circulation that require nonzero interactions .",
    "the very interesting implication of these solutions is that in a spin - orbit coupled system vortex states might spontaneously be created in one or both components , sometimes in the physical region with nonzero density and sometimes in the central region with zero density ( these latter vortices lead to quantized circulation around the annulus ) .    while our study does not in any way exhaust all the possible phases , it gives a sense of the richness of this problem .",
    "a natural future project is a more systematic study of the solutions presented in fig.2 ( d ) and fig.3 .",
    "finally , the dimensional reduction we have performed provides a general method , which ( with the trivial inclusion of interactions ) may be useful in investigating questions related with e.g. , nonlinear , solitary - wave solutions in quasi - one - dimensional spin - orbit coupled systems .",
    "e. . k. , g. m. k. , and f. m. acknowledge the hospitality of lund university .",
    "this work was partially financed by the swedish research council and  nanolund \" .",
    "the numerical method used to solve the two coupled gross - pitaevskii - like equations for the two pseudospin components of the order parameter , given by eq .",
    "( [ 2gp ] ) of the main text , is based on a fourth - order split - step fourier method within an imaginary - time propagation technique .",
    "the details of the method were previously discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore here we give only a brief overview of the method .",
    "the starting point , which forms the basis of the imaginary - time propagation method , is to consider the time - dependent schrdinger equation in imaginary time , i.e. , @xmath120 ( in the expressions below we use atomic units for convenience ) @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the hamiltonian , and to propagate the wave function @xmath123 under the action of a time evolution operator @xmath124 , @xmath125 if the initial state @xmath126 is expanded in the eigenstates @xmath127 of the hamiltonian , with eigenvalues @xmath128 , then @xmath129 therefore , the time - evolution operator leads to an exponential decay of the eigenstates , where the one with the lowest energy @xmath130 decays with the slowest rate and @xmath131 eventually converges to the ground state @xmath132 as @xmath133 .    to evaluate the time evolution given in eq.([eq : expansion ] ) , we use a forward fourth - order algorithm called split - step fourier method : @xmath134 in our study @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the kinetic energy , serves as an effective potential and it consists of the external trapping potential , the interaction and the spin - orbit coupling terms . the mid - point effective potential in eq.([eq : fourthorder ] )",
    "is given by @xmath137.\\ ] ] the order parameter is discretized on a square mesh of @xmath138 points ( @xmath139 is an integer ) in both @xmath10 and @xmath140 directions with separation @xmath141 and its fourier transform is computed using the discretized fast fourier transform ( fft ) .    in our calculations",
    "we have used @xmath142 grid points with @xmath143 , where we have observed that larger grid sizes do not have a significant effect on the obtained results .",
    "the time step @xmath144 had to be chosen small enough to ensure that the hamiltonian of the system does not change dramatically between the iterations .",
    "the optimum value of @xmath144 , which satisfies this condition and also provides a good convergence in our study , has been determined as 0.01 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have observed that the use of smaller time steps does not improve the accuracy of our results .",
    "the time evolution procedure requires an initial condition for the wave function that is propagated in imaginary time until a steady - state solution with the ( local or absolute ) minimum of energy is reached after a sufficiently large number of iterations .",
    "for example , to obtain the solution with nonzero circulation given in the third column of fig .",
    "2 ( d ) and in fig.3 , we have performed calculations using ten different initial states .",
    "we have found that all the results exhibit density distributions with a nonzero circulation and the result presented in fig.2 ( d ) and in fig.3 is the energetically most favorable state .",
