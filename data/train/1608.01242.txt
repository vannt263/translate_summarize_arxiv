    "this paper presents new or updated orbits for 55 binary systems or subsystems .",
    "it is based on speckle interferometric measurements made at the 4.1-m southern astrophyisical research ( soar ) telescope @xcite combined with archival data collected in the washington double star catalog , wds @xcite .",
    "it continues previous work on binary orbits resulting from the soar speckle program .",
    "the sixth catalog of visual binary orbits , vb6 @xcite , presently contains orbital elements of more than 2600 pairs .",
    "knowledge of binary orbits is needed in various areas such as : ( i ) measurement of stellar masses ( especially for stars of very low or high mass , unusual chemical composition or at various evolutionary stages ) ; ( ii ) statistics of orbital elements in relation to mechanisms of binary formation and evolution ; ( iii ) accurate models of stellar motion for astrometry ; ( iv ) binary systems of special interest , for example exohosts or young binaries with circumstellar material .",
    "the latter class is poorly defined , given that a common `` uninteresting '' binary may suddenly become important in the light of new discoveries , e.g. the visual triple star hd  131399 hosting an unusual planet @xcite .",
    "accurate parallaxes soon to be available from _ gaia _ will greatly enhance the value of binary orbits for calibration of stellar masses . during five years of this mission , only portions of long binary periods will be covered , making the ground - based monitoring an essential complement .",
    "these arguments indicate that the work on binary orbits is part of the astronomical infrastructure and has its own value .",
    "most binaries studied here consist of late - type dwarfs in the solar neighborhood , including close pairs first resolved by _",
    "these pairs have orbital periods measured in years and decades , while wider classical visual binaries have periods of a few centuries or millenia .",
    "efforts to monitor the motion of these fast binaries by speckle interferometry have been made by @xcite , @xcite , and others mostly on the northern sky .",
    "the soar data on their southern counterparts reveal a fast motion and the lack of coverage after the _ hipparcos _ discovery in 1991 .",
    "first , still preliminary orbits of several such pairs are presented here .",
    "another class of preliminary orbits have long periods and incomplete orbit coverage , so typical for visual orbits . unlike spectroscopists who accumulate data for one or several orbital revolutions before publishing the orbit",
    ", the visual binary community has a tradition of sharing the observations , because the time needed for an orbit calculation may exceed the human life span .",
    "the downside of this tradition is publication of premature orbits and frequent , sometimes poorly justified orbit revisions .",
    "one of the reasons for publishing here uncertain first - time orbits is the need to understand the orbital motion and to plan further observations for their improvement .    compared to visual micrometer measures ,",
    "speckle interferometry has a much improved accuracy ( the soar data have random and systematic errors of a few mas ) .",
    "some classical binaries discovered and measured at the limit of visual techniques have now reliable and accurate orbits based on speckle interferometry .",
    "large resolving power of the 4.1-m soar telescope allows to map previously inaccessible portions of their orbits near periastron .",
    "this is particularly important for difficult orbits with high eccentricity or oriented edge - on .",
    "such orbits are under - represented in the vb6 and hence distort the statistics .",
    "traditionally , visual binary orbits were mostly computed by the observers themselves who had a deep understanding of the underlying data and its reliability .",
    "speckle interferometry is more reliable than micrometer measures ; however , measures of close or very unequal pairs near the limit of the technique can also be unreliable or distorted by instrumental artifacts .",
    "access to the original soar data and the possibility to reprocess doubtful measures distinguishes this work from orbit calculation made by others .",
    "orbital elements and their errors are determined by least - squares fitting using the idl code orbit .",
    "] when no prior orbit is available , the initial approximation is chosen interactively , considering the observed motion of each pair .",
    "this step is non - trivial because position angles are determined by speckle interferometry only modulo 180 , allowing quadrant `` flips '' , the orbit coverage often has large gaps , and some measurements are simply erroneous . sometimes the same data can be represented by several very different orbits .",
    "the least - squares method implies that the measurement errors are known and normally distributed ; in such case the optimum weights are inversely proportional to the squares of the errors .",
    "visual measurements do not match this model , having random and/or systematic errors that are difficult to quantify .",
    "the errors of speckle interferometry behave better , but depend on the instrument , telescope aperture , magnitude difference , wavelength , data quality , etc .",
    ", so there are no simple prescriptions for their evaluation . here the errors are assigned subjectively based on these considerations and are corrected iteratively by assigning larger errors ( hence smaller weights ) to the outliers .",
    "the result is checked by computing the @xmath0 metric , where @xmath1 is the number of degrees of freedom . in the ideal case , @xmath2 . the same error in the radial and tangential directions is adopted for each observation .",
    "this is true for speckle interferometry , while the known tendency of visual observers to measure angles more accurately than separations is ignored here , considering low weight of the visual data . for many pairs observed at soar ,",
    "the rms residuals from the orbits are on the order of 1mas . the weighting scheme adopted in the vb6 does not fully account for the high accuracy of soar data ; as a result , some recent orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are `` pulled away '' by inaccurate old measures and leave systematic residuals to the soar data .    as mentioned above , for some binaries the scarce available observations",
    "do not fully constrain their orbital elements and are compatible with a wide range of orbits . in such cases , the mass sum calculated using the hip2 parallax @xcite provides a guidance on selecting the most plausible orbit .",
    "some orbital elements can be fixed while fitting the remaining elements , so that the resulting mass sum takes a reasonable value .",
    "this approach does not work for binaries with unknown or small parallax .",
    "table  [ tab : orb ] lists the orbital elements and their errors in common notation ( @xmath3  orbital period , @xmath4  epoch of periastron , @xmath5  eccentricity , @xmath6  semimajor axis , @xmath7  position angle of the node for the equinox j2000.0 , @xmath8  argument of periastron , @xmath9  inclination ) .",

    "unrealistically large errors are assigned to the discarded observations , so that they have no influence on the fitted elements but are still kept in the table .",
    "the last two columns of table  [ tab : obs ] contain the residuals o@xmath14c in angle and separation .",
    "table  [ tab : ptm ] provides additional information , namely the the spectral type as given in _ hipparcos _ or simbad and the hip2 parallax @xmath15 , to be compared to the dynamical parallax @xmath16 in the next column .",
    "the latter is evaluated by the baize - romani method , applicable when binary components follow the standard main - sequence relation between mass and absolute magnitude .",
    "taking the initial mass sum @xmath17 , i compute the dynamical parallax @xmath18 , use it to evaluate the absolute @xmath19 magnitudes of both components , and estimate their masses @xmath20 and @xmath21 by means of the standard relation by @xcite , valid for @xmath22 and extrapolated to larger masses in a few cases .",

    ", the combined magnitudes refer to the secondary subsystems , while @xmath25 mag is assumed to match the estimated spectral type k0v of both pairs .",
    "the last four columns of table  [ tab : ptm ] provide differential photometry resulting from the soar speckle interferometry , where the filters @xmath26 and @xmath27 have central wavelengths and bandwidths of 543/22 and 788/132 nm , respectively .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath29 are average values , while @xmath30 and @xmath31 stand for the rms scatter of magnitude difference in each filter if measured several times , indicating internal consistency of the differential photometry .",
    "for some pairs this scatter is as good as 0.1 mag , but it can be up to @xmath320.5 mag .",
    "speckle differential photometry is unreliable for very close pairs at or below the diffraction limit . for faint or wide binaries ,",
    "@xmath33 can be systematically overestimated . despite these caveats ,",
    "speckle interferometry at soar is the only source of differential photometry for some close binaries .    when both @xmath28 and @xmath29 are measured , the empirical linear relation @xmath34 holds , allowing to estimate differential magnitudes in both filters even when measurements in only one filter are available .",
