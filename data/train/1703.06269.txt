    "recent observational data are in the favor of an accelerating phase of the universe expansion . to explain this late time cosmic speed up , one can follow two main approaches .",
    "the first approach is to add some mysterious components ( dubbed dark energy ) in the energy - momentum sector of the einstein field equations .",
    "the cosmological constant is a possible candidate for dark energy .",
    "however , some yet unsolved problems such as unknown origin , lake of dynamics and a huge amount of fine tuning for its magnitude , have led cosmologist to propose other candidates for a dynamical dark energy component . in this respect ,",
    "several types of scalar fields such as quintessence , phantom , tachyon and k - essence are considered as possible candidates for dark energy so far ; see for instance  @xcite .",
    "the second approach is modification of the geometric ( gravitational ) sector of the einstein field equations . in comparison with `` dark energy '' , this modification is called usually as the `` dark geometry '' .",
    "modification of the geometric sector is accomplished in several ways like as modification of the einstein - hilbert action by replacing the ricci scalar with a generic function of this scalar as @xmath4  @xcite , considering the gauss - bonnet term or even higher order derivative terms in the spirit of general scalar - tensor theories in the action of the model  @xcite and adopting braneworld scenarios  @xcite .",
    "our attention in this paper is paid to an extension of the braneworld scenarios in the spirit of recently proposed mimetic gravity .    from superstring theories , to have a worthwhile theory our observed universe should be a membrane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime called the bulk .",
    "extra spatial dimensions should be compactified on the scales that compared to usual four spatial dimensions are so small  @xcite . in this framework",
    ", gravity propagates through the entire spacetime , whereas the ordinary matters are trapped on the brane .",
    "dgp ( dvali - gabadadze - porrati )  @xcite and randall - sundrum ( rs ) ( i and ii )  @xcite braneworld models are the ones in which the universe is considered to be a 5d spacetime and our 4d world is embedded in a 5d bulk .",
    "the dgp setup is based on the modification of the gravitational sector of the theory over large distances in an induced gravity perspective . in this model ,",
    "the bulk is a flat minkowski spacetime . on the other hand , in rs ( i and ii ) models",
    "the bulk is @xmath5 .",
    "rs i model , which was proposed to solve the hierarchy problem , consists of two minkowski brane embedded in @xmath5 bulk . in this model ,",
    "the standard matters are confined on the brane with negative tension ( embedded at @xmath6 ) and then gravity is confined on the hidden brane with positive tension ( embedded at @xmath7 ) .",
    "gravity leaks off the brane and through the bulk reaches to our brane .",
    "however , in this model there are some problems like as the stabilization of the radion and the lack of the acceptable cosmology . in the second rs model ( rs ii model )",
    "@xmath8 is considered to be infinite and our observed universe is located on the brane with positive tension , embedded at @xmath7  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the spacetime is effectively compactified within the curvature radius @xmath9 of the @xmath5 bulk and in length scale larger than @xmath9 , the 4-dimensional einstein gravity is effectively recovered on the brane . actually , in this model since there are a negative cosmological constant in the bulk and a positive tension on the brane ( in addition to the ordinary matter ) , it is possible to cancel out the bulk energy s contribution on the brane and get the standard 4-dimensional friedmann equation at late time , corresponding to the low energy scales  @xcite .",
    "rs ii model is one of the interesting barneworld models ( specially for a viable initial time cosmology ) and some authors have studied its cosmological aspects in details ( see for instance  @xcite ) . in this regard ,",
    "the authors of paper  @xcite have studied an evolving universe with any types of matter on the brane and a cosmological constant in the bulk , and solved the 5d einstein s field equations . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors have considered a scalar field in the bulk and studied the cosmological solutions both in bulk and brane in their setup .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have studied the cosmological inflation driven by a dilaton - like gravitational field in the bulk . by modeling the effective potential of the gravitational scalar field ,",
    "they have obtained the solution of the bulk field s equation and found that the solution gives slow - roll inflation on the brane . in ref .",
    "@xcite the dynamics of the bulk scalar field in more general situations has been discussed and it has been shown that there is a simple relation between the 5d potential and the effective 4d potential on the brane . this feature is an essential preliminary in our work .    in 2013 , an interesting model for gravity ( the so called _ mimetic gravity _ ) has been proposed which can explain the origin of the dark sectors in a fascinating manner  @xcite . in the original model , a free and non - dynamical scalar field @xmath10 and an auxiliary metric @xmath11",
    "are ingredients of the physical metric @xmath12 with the following definition @xmath13 this model respects the conformal symmetry as an internal degree of freedom and the scalar field encodes the conformal mode of the gravity .",
    "if we perform a weyl transformation of the auxiliary metric , the physical metric is invariant .",
    "when we define the physical metric as in ( [ eq1 ] ) , an extra longitudinal mode of the gravitational field would be appeared in the equations of motion which ensures the weyl invariance .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have shown that this longitudinal mode can reproduce dark matter and can be considered as a source of the cold dark matter .",
    "then in  @xcite chamseddine _",
    "_ have investigated the mimetic matter in the presence of an arbitrary potential @xmath14 , by using the lagrange multipliers approach proposed in  @xcite . by adopting the appropriate potentials , they have obtained various cosmological solutions and found that depending on the choice of the potential , the mimetic matter can behaves as quintessence , phantom or inflaton fields .",

    "we show that the footprint of this scalar field can play the role of a mimetic matter on the brane .",
    "in fact we suppose that the scalar degree of freedom which mimics the dark sectors on the brane has its origin on a bulk scalar field , @xmath0 . by writing the effective 4d einstein equations induced on the brane , we find the effective fridmann equation on the brane . by regarding the relation between the 5d potential and the effective 4d potential and by considering the effective scalar field on the brane to be @xmath10 ( the scalar field defined in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) ) , we present the equation for potential of the brane mimetic scalar field . in this regard",
    ", we obtain the friedmann equation , the scale factor and the equation of state parameter for some specific potentials in this setup . by numerical analysis on the models parameters space",
    "we investigate the late time accelerating phase of the universe expansion as well as initial inflation in this setup .",
    "we show that it is possible to realize cosmological inflation in this setup .",
    "we show also that equation of state parameter of the induced mimetic field on the brane crosses the phantom divide line in the same way as observations show : it evolves from quintessence to phantom phase by crossing the phantom divide in a redshift that is compatible with observation such as planck2015 data .",
    "in mimetic gravity  @xcite , the physical metric is given by eq .",

    "we obtain @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "finally , in the absence of ordinary matter the following friedmann equation gives the cosmological dynamics in this setup @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the amount of the mimetic dark matter is determined by the constant of integration in ( [ eq11 ] ) since it behaves like matter as @xmath33 .",
    "another mimetic component contributes in ( [ eq11 ] ) which depends on the types of various potentials that are used in this setup .    in the next step we focus briefly on the cosmological dynamics of a bulk scalar field in the rs ii braneworld scenario ( see refs .",

    "that is , the mimetic scalar field is the effective 4d scalar field evaluated on the brane .",
    "we assume that the scalar field @xmath10 to be identical with time @xmath90 on the brane and there is no contribution from the ordinary matter fields in the energy - momentum tensor on the brane . by neglecting the non - trivial contribution of bulk weyl tensor as @xmath53 in equation ( [ eq26 ] ) and adopting @xmath91 , we obtain the effective energy density of the mimetic field on the brane as follows @xmath92 now from this equation and also equations ( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq324 ] ) we find the potential of the bulk scalar field in terms of the mimetic potential on the brane as @xmath93 on the other hand , from equation ( [ eq28 ] ) we have @xmath94 where @xmath90 is the brane time coordinate .",

    "so , this brane mimetic scenario essentially has the capability to realize initial time cosmic inflation .",
    "figure [ fig0 ] shows the behavior of the scale factor ( [ scale0 ] ) versus cosmic time and the parameter @xmath101 . for large values of @xmath101 ,",
    "possibility of realization of exponential expansion is evident by the slope of the curves .    as the second case , we adopt the following mimetic potential after ref .",

    "on the other hand , the equation of state parameter is a dynamical parameter which its value changes by evolution of the universe . according to the observational data ,",
    "@xmath115 has crossed the phantom divide line ( @xmath117 ) at the near past .",
    "in fact , observations show that the universe had a transition from a quintessence phase to a phantom phase .",
    "so , a successful dark energy model should realize a crossing of the phantom divide in the past .",
    "in this regard , we study the evolution of @xmath115 versus the the cosmic time to see its capability to realize a phantom divide crossing .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig3 ] . as this figure shows , depending on the value of @xmath101 ( specially for sufficiently small @xmath101 such as @xmath118 ) , the equation of state parameter in this model starts from @xmath119 and then crosses the phantom divide at a redshift which depends on the value of @xmath101 .",
    "so , this model is successful to address the late time cosmic dynamics in a fascinating manner .    as the third and even richer example",
    ", we consider the following potential @xmath120 where with @xmath30 gives the following scale factor @xmath121 for simplicity in our numerical analysis , in what follows we set @xmath122 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the behavior of this scale factor .",
    "as this figure shows , the adopted potential has the capability to realize initial inflation as well as the late time accelerated expansion .",
    "these features can be seen via the slope of the curves which depends on the value of @xmath122 .",
    "the equation of state parameter in this case is as follows    @xmath123    figure [ fig5 ] gives the constraint on @xmath101 and @xmath105 from the planck2015 observational data in this case .",
    "finally , figure [ fig6 ] gives the evolution of the equation of state parameter .",
    "as this figure shows , late time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing can be addressed in this case successfully .",
    "it is interesting to note that the case with @xmath117 as a late time cosmological dominated universe is well in the parameter space of the model .",
    "this work has been devoted to an extension of the idea of mimetic gravity to braneworld scenario . in the original mimetic matter scenario , chamseddine and mukhanov",
