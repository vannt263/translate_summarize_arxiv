    "at high temperature and baryon densities , qcd predicts strongly interacting matter to undergo a phase transition from hadronic constituents to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons . at the same time",
    "chiral symmetry , spontaneously broken in the hadronic world , is restored .",
    "high - energy nuclear collisions provide the only way to investigate this issue in the laboratory . among the different observables used in this context , lepton pairs are particularly attractive .",
    "in contrast to hadrons , they directly probe the entire space - time evolution of the expanding fireball formed in such a collision , escaping freely without final - state interactions . at low invariant masses m@xmath01",
    "gev ( lmr ) , thermal dilepton production is largely mediated by the light vector mesons @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . among these ,",
    "the broad @xmath3 ( 770 ) is by far the most important , due to its strong coupling to the @xmath8 channel and its life time of only 1.3 fm , making it subject to regeneration in the much longer - lived fireball .",
    "it has therefore been considered since long as the prime probe for `` in - medium modifications '' of hadron properties , including even the qcd phase boundary itself  [ 1 - 5 ] . at intermediate masses m@xmath91 gev ( imr ) , where hadronic spectral functions become increasingly uniform , planck - like thermal radiation is expected from both hadronic and partonic sources .",
    "dileptons with their independent variables mass and transverse momentum should be able to unambiguously differentiate between the two ( unlike real photons ) .    experimentally , excess dileptons above the known sources have been found and reported upon before  [ 6 - 9 ] , starting around 1995 .",
    "a short review , including also the preceding ( very influential ) pp era and theoretical milestones , has been published in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , insufficient data quality in terms of statistics and mass resolution as well as the unclear role of non - thermal sources like open charm hindered final clarification on all fronts up to recently .",
    "a large step forward in technology , leading to completely new standards of the data quality in this field , has now been achieved by the `` third - generation '' experiment na60 at the cern sps .",
    "the central results have already been published  [ 11 - 17 ] .",
    "the present paper shortly reviews them , but places also particular emphasis on the quantitative understanding of the thermal - radiation part in connection with the medium modification of hadrons ( one of the main topics of the workshop ) , just to create confidence towards a community which is usually exposed to `` elementary '' reactions rather than heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the na60 apparatus @xcite combines the muon spectrometer previously used by na10/na38/na50 with a novel radiation - hard , silicon - pixel vertex telescope , placed inside a 2.5 t dipole magnet between the target region and the hadron absorber .",
    "the matching of the muon tracks in the two spectrometers , both in coordinate and momentum space , greatly improves the dimuon mass resolution , reduces the combinatorial background from @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays , and allows to measure the dimuon offset with respect to the primary interaction vertex to tag open charm decays .",
    "the traditional high luminosity of dimuon in contrast to dielectron experiments is still conserved .",
    "the data presented in this paper were taken for 158a gev in - in collisions .",
    "the analysis was done in three major steps : assessment and subtraction of the background , identification of excess dimuons above the known sources and their subtraction from the latter , and full correction for experimental acceptance in all variables .",
    "the last two steps were never done in this field before and are thus unique to na60 .",
    "the left panel of fig.1  @xcite shows the opposite - sign , background and signal dimuon mass spectra , integrated over all collision centralities ( determined by the track multiplicity in the si telescope ) .",
    "the combinatorial background has been determined with an accuracy of about 1% by using a mixed - event technique  @xcite , the much weaker background of incorrect ( `` fake '' ) matches between the two spectrometers by an overlay monte carlo method .",
    "after subtraction of the total background , the resulting net spectrum contains about 440000 events , exceeding previous results by up to 3 orders of magnitude in effective statistics , depending on mass .",
    "the enlarged lmr part of the net spectrum is shown in the middle panel of fig.1  [ 11 - 14,16 ] .",
    "it is dominated by the known sources : the electromagnetic two - body decays of the completely resolved @xmath12 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 resonances , and the dalitz decays of the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath4 . while the peripheral `` pp - like '' data are quantitatively described by the sum of a `` cocktail '' of these contributions together with the @xmath3 and open charm  @xcite , this is not true for the more centrally weighted total data shown in fig.1 , due to the existence of a strong excess of pairs .",
    "the high data quality allows to isolate this excess with a priori _ unknown characteristics _ without any fits : the cocktail of the decay sources is subtracted from the total using _ local _ criteria which are solely based on the measured mass distribution itself .",
    "the @xmath3 is not subtracted .",
    "the excess resulting from this difference formation is illustrated in the same figure .",
    "for p@xmath1 spectra , angular distributions and centrality dependences , the subtraction procedure is done in narrow slices of the respective variables ( see [ 11 - 14 ] for details and error discussion ) .",
    "the subtracted data for the @xmath12 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 themselves are subject to the same further steps as the excess data .",
    "the ( extended ) imr part is shown in the right panel of fig.1  @xcite .",
    "the use of the silicon vertex tracker has allowed to disentangle prompt and offset dimuons resulting from simultaneous semi - muonic decays of ( correlated ) d and @xmath14 mesons .",
    "the results are perfectly consistent with no enhancement of open charm , but rather match the level expected from upscaling the na50 results on charm in pa collisions .",
    "the excess observed in the imr , confirming the result previously found by na50 , is really prompt , with an enhancement over drell - yan production of dimuons by a factor of 2.4@xmath150.08  @xcite .",
    "the excess can now be isolated in the same way as done in the lmr , by subtracting the expected known sources , here drell - yan and open charm as plotted in fig.1 , from the total data .         in the last step ,",
    "the data are corrected for the acceptance of the na60 apparatus and for the centrality - dependent pair reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "the acceptance shows strong variations with mass and p@xmath1 in the low - mass / low - p@xmath1 region  @xcite , but is understood on the level of @xmath010% , based on a detailed study of the peripheral data  @xcite and a number of further investigations . in principle , the correction requires a 5-dimensional grid in m - p@xmath1-y - cos@xmath16-cos@xmath5 space ( @xmath16 , @xmath5 being the angles describing the dilepton angular distributions ) .",
    "this is neither realistic nor optimal .",
    "to avoid the large statistical errors connected with low - acceptance bins , the correction is usually done in 2-dimensional grids , using the measured distributions in the other variables as an input ( examples m - p@xmath1  @xcite or y - p@xmath1  @xcite or @xmath16-@xmath5  @xcite ) .",
    "this clearly requires an iteration procedure to become self - consistent , fortunately eased by an often only small sensitivity .",
    "it is of great importance , however , to treat the different sources separately , i.e. _ after _ the subtraction procedure , due to differences in the distributions ( open charm , e.g. , is completely different ) .",
    "the prime results on the excess data are summarized in figs.2 - 4 .",
    "the pure data aspects will be discussed first , followed by a coherent interpretation of all results in terms of thermal radiation further below .",
    "the left panel of fig.2 shows the inclusive invariant mass spectrum of the excess dimuons for the complete range 0.2@xmath0m@xmath02.5 gev , with all known sources subtracted ( except for the @xmath3 ) , integrated over p@xmath1 , corrected for experimental acceptance and normalized absolutely to the charged - particle rapidity density  @xcite .",
    "compared to an earlier version of the figure  @xcite , the errors have significantly decreased at low masses , using a 1-dimensional acceptance correction in m based on the measured correlated m - p@xmath1 information  ( @xcite and fig.3 ) .",
    "in addition , the subtraction of the narrow resonances is now based on an improved modeling of the experimental resolution  @xcite , leading to a smoother spectral shape in the region of the @xmath5 .",
    "the left panel of fig.3 shows the associated m@xmath1 spectra for the lmr part , where m@xmath1=(p@xmath17+m@xmath18)@xmath19 .",
    "the normalization is arbitrary , allowing for an even spacing of the 10 spectra , but the absolute normalization of their integrals can directly be taken from the mass spectrum .",
    "in contrast to an earlier version of the figure  @xcite , the p@xmath1 coverage has mostly been extended to about 3 gev .",
    "the m@xmath1 spectra for the imr part are shown in the right panel of fig.3  @xcite .",
    "all m@xmath1 spectra are , to a very high degree of accuracy  @xcite , pure exponentials for ( m@xmath1-m)@xmath200.2 gev  @xcite .",
    "the complete information can therefore be condensed into one single parameter for each spectrum ( determined with a very high accuracy ) , the inverse slope parameter t@xmath21 , obtained by fitting the m@xmath1 data with the usual `` m@xmath1-scaling '' expression @xmath22@xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the resulting values of t@xmath21 are plotted in the right panel of fig.2 vs. dimuon mass . above 1 gev",
    ", the lmr data are corrected for dy to be consistent with the ( independent ) imr analysis . to complement the information on m and p@xmath1",
    ", fig.4 finally shows the results from a systematic study of the dimuon angular distributions  @xcite , another first in the field .",
    "using the collins - soper reference frame ( but the results are independent of that choice ) , all structure function parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( related to the spin - density matrix of the virtual photon ) are found to be zero , and the projected distributions in |cos@xmath16| and |@xmath5| are seen in fig.4 to be uniform .",
    "this is a nontrivial result : the annihilation of quarks or pions along the beam direction , e.g. , would lead to @xmath25=+1 , @xmath26=@xmath27=0 ( lowest - order dy ) or @xmath25=-1 , @xmath26=@xmath27=0 , corresponding to transverse and longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon , respectively .         without resorting to any detailed theoretical modeling ,",
    "the data themselves allow for a consistent global interpretation of the observed excess dimuons in terms of thermal radiation from the fireball .",
    "three necessary prerequisites to justify the term are clearly fulfilled : ( i ) a planck - like ( nearly exponential ) shape of the mass spectrum above 1 gev , where the underlying spectral functions are expected to be uniform ( as in the black - body case ) , ( ii ) purely exponential m@xmath1 spectra , and ( iii ) the absence of any polarization as expected for radiation from a randomized system .",
    "turning next to a more detailed discussion , the large drop of t@xmath21 around masses of 1 gev as seen in the right panel of fig.2 is a strong hint for a qualitative change of the radiation from the lmr to the imr .",
    "the mass region @xmath01 gev has traditionally been associated with the process @xmath2 as the dominant dilepton source .",
    "indeed , the mass spectrum shows a considerable modulation , with clear signs for a ( broadened ) @xmath3 . in the same region",
    ", t@xmath21 shows a monotonic rise with mass all the way up to the nominal pole position of the @xmath3 . this is a strong indication for radial flow of a `` hadron - like '' dilepton source , as confirmed by the genuine na60 hadron data plotted in the same figure .",
    "the parameter t@xmath21 can roughly be described by a superposition of a thermal and a flow part in the form t@xmath21@xmath23t+m@xmath28@xmath18 , where @xmath28 is the average flow velocity .",
    "maximal flow is reached for the point with t@xmath21@xmath23300 mev , obtained by isolating the peak part in the mass spectrum by a side - window subtraction method  @xcite and interpreted as the freeze - out @xmath3 at the end of the fireball evolution , synonymous to the other hadrons .",
    "the maximal flow then mirrors the expected maximal coupling of the @xmath3 to pions , while all other hadrons freeze out earlier , in quantitative support by a na60 blast - wave analysis  @xcite . extrapolating the trend of t@xmath21 vs. m down to zero mass ( and taking account of relativistic corrections for m@xmath0p@xmath1 )",
    ", the average temperature is found to be about 130 - 140 mev in this region , considerably below t@xmath7@xmath23170 mev .",
    "the interpretation of the mass region @xmath91 gev is quite straightforward , eased by an argument not placed before . assuming flat spectral functions in the spirit of parton - hadron duality in the dilepton rates , the momentum - integrated yield is given by @xmath29 , where t reflects some space - time average over the system evolution .",
    "a fit of the mass spectrum with this expression over the range 1.2@xmath0m@xmath02.0 gev gives t=205@xmath1512 mev . since m is by construction a lorentz - invariant , the mass spectrum is immune to any motion of the emitting sources , unlike m@xmath1 spectra or planck s law itself .",
    "the parameter t in the spectral shape of the mass spectrum is therefore purely thermal .",
    "the fit value of about 200 mev , considerably above t@xmath7@xmath23170 mev , thus directly implies partonic emission sources to dominate in the imr .",
    "this is fully consistent with an independent argument placed by na60 from the beginning  @xcite : the striking jump - like drop in t@xmath21 around 1 gev visible in fig.2 can never be created by a continued hadronic scenario , but reflects early emission with a possible connection to the soft point in the equation - of - state as obtained from lattice qcd ( most relevant at sps energies ) . in the partonic scenario ,",
    "flow can hardly develop up to t@xmath7 .",
    "this is reflected by the same average value of about 200 mev seen in the t@xmath21 plot beyond 1 gev , with no margin left for flow within the errors of 10 - 20 mev , not to speak about any rising mass dependence in this region .",
    "these rather clear conclusions also end the years - long discussion on hadron - parton duality , where duality in the rates has been incorrectly taken over as duality in the yields , ignoring the differences in the space - time integration for partons and hadrons .",
    "the three sets of thermal model results [ 21 - 23 ] which are also plotted in the left panel of fig.2 largely confirm the above observations . to the extent that they roughly agree both with the shape and the absolute magnitude of the data , they present a fourth strong argument supporting the interpretation of the excess dimuons as thermal radiation .",
    "in particular , the agreement of the hees / rapp scenario  @xcite with the data in the region of the @xmath3 spectral function is really spectacular , as shown even more clearly in a paper by rapp presented at this workshop  @xcite . in the region above 1 gev , all three models explicitly differentiate between partonic and hadronic processes . in case of  @xcite , partons dominate , and the data are fully described up to 2.5 gev .",
    "the average temperature associated with these two scenarios is 217 mev ( compared to the measured 205@xmath1512 mev ) , with a small increase of the local values by about 10% towards higher masses .",
    "partons also dominate in a further scenario not contained in fig.2  @xcite . in case of  @xcite",
    "however , hadrons dominate , with corresponding lower values of t , but the predictions stop at 1.5 gev , too low to completely bear out the resulting conflict with the data in the region up to 2.5 gev .",
    "the mediation of thermal radiation in the lmr by the vector mesons implies a convolution of the dilepton rate over the space - time evolution of the fireball , where the rate is given by the photon propagator , phase space factors and the vector meson spectral functions  @xcite . in case of the narrow @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ", the convolution hardly affects the line shape , and these mesons can therefore be isolated in a straightforward way . in case of the broad @xmath3 , however , in particular if further broadened in the medium , the spectral shape is completely masked by the convolution procedure as seen in fig.2 , where the dilepton yield even increases further below the nominal pole of the @xmath3 .",
    "unfolding the final result is plainly impossible . a realistic way to at least project out the space - time averaged @xmath3 spectral function is the use of a suitable correction function in 2-dimensional m - p@xmath1 space . by a strange coincidence of suitable conditions , the experimental acceptance of na60 ,",
    "being strongly reduced in the low - mass / low - p@xmath1 region  @xcite , provides such a correction function in an unexpectedly perfect way .",
    "the left panel of fig.5 proves the point  @xcite . thermal radiation with an underlying uniform spectral function , using a full ( uncut ) p@xmath1 spectrum with an inverse slope parameter t@xmath21 representative for the average ,",
    "is transformed after propagation through the acceptance into again a uniform spectrum up to about 1 gev , within 10% . in other words ,",
    "the steep rise of the thermal spectrum due to the photon propagator and the boltzmann factor is just about compensated by the falling acceptance in this region .",
    "variations of the input p@xmath1 spectrum within reasonable physics limits affect the flatness of the output by at most 20% .",
    "the right panel of fig.5 shows the excess data in the lmr as directly measured , i.e. before correction for acceptance  @xcite .",
    "this then can be interpreted as the in - medium @xmath3 spectral function , averaged over space - time and momenta .",
    "in order to compare to theory , a centrality selection of 110@xmath0@xmath30@xmath0170 has been applied , but the data are very close to the inclusive data ( @xmath31=120 ) with their much better statistics , contained in the middle panel of fig.1 .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath3 spectral function with centrality is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "a peaked structure is always seen , broadening strongly with centrality , but remaining essentially centered around the nominal pole position of the @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath32 of the distributions increases monotonically from that of a free @xmath3 to almost the value of a uniform spectrum .",
    "the total yield relative to the ( estimated ) cocktail @xmath3 increases by a factor of 6 - 7 , reflecting the `` @xmath3-clock ''  @xcite , i.e. the number of @xmath3 generations created during the fireball evolution .",
    "fig.5 also contains the two main theoretical scenarios developed historically for the in - medium spectral properties of the @xmath3 , dropping mass  @xcite and broadening  @xcite , evaluated here for the same fireball evolution  @xcite .",
    "the model results are normalized to the data in the mass interval m@xmath00.9 gev , just to be independent of the fireball evolution .",
    "the unmodified @xmath3 is clearly ruled out .",
    "the broadening scenario gets remarkably close , while the dropping mass scenario completely fails .",
    "this ends a decades - long controversy about the spectral properties of hadrons close to the qcd phase boundary , kept active solely through insufficient data quality .",
    "the connection to chiral symmetry restoration remains an open theoretical issue , but the way chiral partners ultimately mix is probably answered with `` complete melting '' .         in nuclear collisions , the longer - lived @xmath4 ( 23 fm ) and @xmath5 ( 46 fm )",
    "have historically received much less attention than the @xmath3 , since most of their dilepton decays occur after thermal freeze - out .",
    "the @xmath4 suffers , on top , from the strong masking by the much more abundant ( regenerated ) @xmath3 , leaving precision work rather to cold nuclear matter experiments .",
    "na60 has addressed the @xmath4 in a way directly coupled to the cocktail subtraction procedure . due to the high mass resolution , the _ disappearance _ of the yield at low p@xmath1 out of the narrow @xmath4 peak in the nominal pole position can sensitively be detected .",
    "the _ appearance _ of the yield elsewhere in the mass spectrum , originating from a mass shift or broadening or both is practically inaccessible , due to the masking by the @xmath3 .",
    "evidence for the disappearance of the @xmath4 has been found by the following procedure  @xcite .",
    "the m@xmath1 spectrum , measured to be a pure exponential for ( m@xmath1-m)@xmath200.6 gev , is fit with the usual m@xmath1-scaling expression used before , defining a reference line .",
    "the line is extrapolated to ( m@xmath1-m)=0 , and the ratio data / reference line is then used to monitor shape changes over the complete range in m@xmath1 .",
    "the procedure is done separately for four centrality bins .",
    "the results are shown in the left panel of fig.6  @xcite , absolutely normalized to the full phase space ratio @xmath4/n@xmath33 .",
    "the effects of disappearance are quite striking : ( i ) a suppression of the relative yield below the reference line only occurs for p@xmath1@xmath341 gev ; ( ii ) there is a very strong centrality dependence of the suppression , reaching down to @xmath340.5 of the reference line ( the large errors reflect the increasing masking by the @xmath3 ) ; ( iii ) the suppression effects are much larger than expected for the spectral distortions due to the blue shift from radial flow at low m@xmath1 ; a simulation on the basis of the blast wave analysis  @xcite shows at most 10% effects for central collisions .",
    "thus , strong in - medium effects also exist for the @xmath4 , but it seems impossible to clarify their nature within the na60 frame .",
    "the results from the same procedure applied to the @xmath5 are shown in the right panel of fig.6 .",
    "no effects are seen beyond the limit set by the blast wave analysis .",
    "a precision analysis of the position and line shape of the @xmath5 , the most isolated and therefore `` easiest '' hadron case in the na60 data , has also been performed  @xcite .",
    "the mass and width are found to be compatible with the pdg values at any centrality and at any p@xmath1 ; no evidence for in - medium modifications is observed .",
    "the precision of the na60 data has set new standards in this field .",
    "this has allowed to consistently interpret the results in terms of thermal radiation , including identification of the two major sources .",
    "theoretical modeling has matched this precision for the in - medium @xmath3 spectral function , but not yet for a description of the dynamics .",
    "it is hoped that the strong constraints placed by these aspects of the data will contribute towards convergence , including the ( theoretically ) still controversial dominance of partons in the imr already at sps energies .",
