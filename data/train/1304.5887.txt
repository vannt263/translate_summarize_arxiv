    "since the discovery of superconductivity in doped cuprtes , a significant body of reliable and reproducible data has been accumulated by using many probes @xcite , which show that the most remarkable expression of the nonconventional physics is found in the normal - state .",
    "the normal - state properties in the underdoped regime exhibit a number of anomalous properties in sense that they do not fit in the conventional fermi - liquid theory .",
    "in particular , it is widely believed that the anomalous normal - state properties in the underdoped regime are closely related to a normal - state pseudogap @xcite , since this normal - state pseudogap observed in the excitation spectrum as a suppression of the spectral weight is particular large in the underdoped regime , then it smoothly decreases with increasing doping @xcite .    after intensive investigations over more than two decades , many ideas have been proposed to understand the origin of the ubiquitous normal - state pseudogap and its connection to the anomalous normal - state properties . because early experiments indicate a dominated d - wave normal - state pseudogap compatible with the superconducting gap",
    ", some authors argued that the normal - state pseudogap is related to some form of the preformed pairing @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there are many reports suggesting that the normal - state pseudogap crossover temperature is associated with a broken symmetry @xcite , and thus another competing order parameter , such as a density wave order @xcite .",
    "moreover , a phenomenological theory of the normal - state pseudogap state has been developed @xcite , where a new feature is the presence of an additional energy scale , i.e. , the normal - state pseudogap in a doped resonant valence bond state .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued that the pseudogap is a combination of a quantum disordered d - wave superconductor and an entirely different form of competing order , originating from the particle - hole channel @xcite .",
    "recently , the interplay between the normal - state pseudogap state and superconductivity in doped cuprates has been discussed based on the kinetic energy driven superconducting mechanism @xcite , where the charge carriers interaction directly through the kinetic energy by exchanging spin excitations induces the normal - state pseudogap state in the particle - hole channel and superconducting - state in the particle - particle channel , therefore both the normal - state pseudogap and superconducting gap are dominated by one energy scale , and they are the result of the strong electron correlation . in particular ,",
    "this normal - state pseudogap is closely related to the quasiparticle coherent weight , and therefore it suppresses the spectral weight .",
    "this microscopic normal - state pseudogap theory gives a consistent description of the physical properties of doped cuprates in the pseudogap phase @xcite , including the humplike anomaly of the specific - heat and the unusual evolution of the fermi arc length with doping and temperature .",
    "in particular , it has been shown within this theoretical framework that the particle - hole asymmetry electronic state in doped cuprates is a natural consequence due to the presence of the normal - state pseudogap @xcite .    among the striking features of the normal - state properties in doped cuprates in the underdoped regime ,",
    "the physical quantity which most evidently displays the signature for the normal - state pseudogap is the charge transport @xcite , which is manifested by the optical conductivity and resistivity .",
    "the optical studies of the electron excitations have revealed much about the nature of the charge carriers in doped cuprates . in particular , the normal - state pseudogap can be observed directly by the infrared measurements of the optical conductivity .",
    "experimentally , it has been shown that the charge dynamics is rather universal within the whole cuprates @xcite , where the optical conductivity for the same doping is nearly materials independent both in the magnitude and energy dependence , and in the underdoped regime it shows the low - energy non - drude behavior ( the conductivity decays as @xmath0 at low energies ) and unusual midinfrared band at higher energies .",
    "although the optical conductivity of doped cuprates is well - established by now @xcite , its full understanding is still a challenging issue . in our early studies @xcite ,",
    "the charge transport of doped cuprates in the underdoped regime has been discussed by considering the second - order correction for the charge carriers , and the results are qualitatively consistent with the corresponding experimental data . in this paper , as a complement of our previous analysis of the charge transport in doped cuprates , we start from the microscopic theory of the normal - state pseudogap state @xcite to discuss the doping and temperature dependence of the normal - state optical properties in the whole doping range from the underdoped to heavily overdoped , and qualitatively reproduce all main features of the optical measurements on doped cuprates @xcite . in particular , we show that the anomalous behavior of the optical conductivity in the underdoped regime can be attributed to the emergence of the normal - state pseudogap .",

    "in doped cuprates , the single common feature is the presence of the two - dimensional cuo@xmath1 plane , and it is believed that the unconventional physical properties of doped cuprates are closely related to the doped cuo@xmath1 planes @xcite . in this case , it has been argued that the @xmath2-@xmath3 model on a square lattice captures the essential physics of the doped cuo@xmath1 plane @xcite , @xmath4 where the summation is over all sites @xmath5 , and for each @xmath5 , over its nearest - neighbors ( nn ) @xmath6 or the next nn @xmath7 , @xmath8 are spin operators , and @xmath9 is the chemical potential .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 model ( [ tjham ] ) is subject to an important on - site local constraint to avoid the double occupancy , i.e. , @xmath10 . in this @xmath2-@xmath3 model ( [ tjham ] )",
    ", the strong electron correlation manifests itself by this single occupancy local constraint , and therefore the crucial requirement is to impose this local constraint .",
    "it has been shown that this constraint can be treated properly in analytical calculations within the charge - spin separation ( css ) fermion - spin theory @xcite , where the physics of no double occupancy is taken into account by representing the electron as a composite object created by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with the spinful fermion operator @xmath13 that describes the charge degree of freedom of the electron together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped hole itself ( charge carrier ) , while the spin operator @xmath14 represents the spin degree of freedom of the electron , then the electron single occupancy local constraint is satisfied in analytical calculations . in particular , it has been shown that under the decoupling scheme , this css fermion - spin representation is a natural representation of the constrained electron defined in the hilbert subspace without double electron occupancy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these charge carrier and spin are gauge invariant @xcite , and in this sense they are real and can be interpreted as physical excitations @xcite . in this css fermion - spin representation , the @xmath2-@xmath3 model ( [ tjham ] ) can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the charge carrier doping concentration . as an important consequence ,",
    "the kinetic energy term in the @xmath2-@xmath3 model has been transferred as the interaction between charge carriers and spins , which reflects that even the kinetic energy term in the @xmath2-@xmath3 model has a strong coulombic contribution due to the restriction of no double occupancy of a given site .",
    "the interaction between charge carriers and spins in the @xmath2-@xmath3 model ( [ cssham ] ) is quite strong , and therefore it dominates the essential physics in doped cuprates in the doped regime without an antiferromagnetic long - range order . for the qualitative comparison with the experimental results of doped cuprates , the charge dynamics should be treated by considering the charge carrier and spin fluctuations . in this case , we follow the previous discussions @xcite , and obtain the full charge carrier green s function as , @xmath18 where the mean - field ( mf ) charge carrier spectrum @xmath19 , the spin correlation functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the number of the nn or next nn sites , while the self - energy @xmath25 can be evaluated in terms of the spin bubble as @xcite , @xmath26 with @xmath27 , and the spin bubble , @xmath28 in the following discussions , we limit the spin part to the mf level , since the electronic structure of doped cuprates in the normal - state can be well described at this level @xcite . in this case , the full spin green s function , @xmath29 in the spin bubble ( [ spin - bubble ] ) can be replaced by the mf spin green s function , @xmath30 $ ] , with the mf spin excitation spectrum @xmath31 and @xmath32 have been given in ref .",

    "<S> within the microscopic theory of the normal - state pseudogap state , the doping and temperature dependence of the charge dynamics in doped cuprates is studied in the whole doping range from the underdoped to heavily overdoped . </S>",
    "<S> the conductivity spectrum in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes contains the low - energy non - drude peak and unusual midinfrared band . </S>",
    "<S> however , the position of the midinfrared band shifts towards to the low - energy non - drude peak with increasing doping . in particular , the low - energy non - drude peak incorporates with the midinfrared band in the heavily overdoped regime , and then the low - energy drude behavior recovers . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the striking behavior of the low - energy non - drude peak and unusual midinfrared band in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes is closely related to the emergence of the doping and temperature dependence of the normal - state pseudogap . </S>"
