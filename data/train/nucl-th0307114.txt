    "due to isospin suppression of the otherwise dominant low - energy isovector weinberg - tomosawa @xmath3n term in the re - scattering diagram , and the negative interference between the remaining impulse and isoscalar pion re - scattering terms@xcite , the empirical data for @xmath4 near threshold is only explained by phenomenological non - pionic , short - range , two - body mechanisms@xcite , or alternatively by an off - shell extrapolation of the @xmath1 amplitude@xcite .",
    "the high quality data for @xmath4 becomes therefore specially interesting by allowing to establish the importance of the short - range mechanisms , which are difficult to constrain : they are subsumed in the low energy constants appearing also in the two- and three - nucleon potentials , but so far these constants have not yet been precisely determined@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , any conclusion to be read off from the @xmath5 production data is only meaningful and quantitative provided that the calculation of the re - scattering diagram@xcite is under absolute control .",
    "this is not the case in calculations performed till now , where approximations at the level of the energy integration of the corresponding feynman diagram were considered .",
    "namely , non - relativistic reductions of the feynman @xmath3-exchange diagram were done , through choices for the energy of the exchanged pion , both for its propagator and for the @xmath6 amplitude at the re - scattering vertex .",
    "this work investigates the validity of the mostly used approximations .",
    "it generalizes the work of refs.@xcite which considers a toy model for scalar particles and interactions .",
    "our calculation employs a physical model for nucleons and pions , with a pseudo - vector coupling for the @xmath7 vertex ; the @xmath8pt @xmath9 re - scattering amplitude@xcite and the bonn b potential for the nucleon - nucleon interaction in the final state .",
    "starting with the feynman diagram , the energy integration in the energy @xmath10 of the exchanged pion was done after a partial fraction decomposition , which isolates the poles of the pion propagator . this way we separated the dwba amplitude from the stretched boxes ( where two exchanged particles may be in flight simultaneously ) contribution .",
    "then , @xmath11 \\frac{1}{\\left(e_1+e_2-e_{\\pi}-\\omega_1-\\omega_2 \\right ) } t_{nn}^{fsi } \\label{dwbafsi}\\ ] ] is the exact expression for the dwba amplitude , where @xmath12 stands for the transition - matrix of the final - state interaction and @xmath13 is the product of the @xmath9 amplitude with the @xmath7 vertex .",
    "the pion propagator turned to be exactly given by @xmath14 ^ 2- \\left[\\left ( e_{tot}-e-\\frac{e_{\\pi}}{2}\\right)-\\frac{\\omega_1+\\omega_2}{2}-\\omega_{\\pi } \\right]^2},\\ ] ] thus , eq.([dwbafsi ] ) is taken as the reference result , in order to investigate the effect of the most common approximations hitherto used for the pion propagator in a dwba final - state calculation .",
    "these approximations correspond to the following three different choices : @xmath15 the `` fixed kinematics '' approximation `` freezes '' the energy for the exchanged pion as the difference between the two on - mass - shell energies of the nucleon , before and after re - scattering , at @xmath16 , its value at threshold ; the `` on - shell approximation '' considers for the energy of the pion the difference between the same on - mass - shell energies of the nucleon , but it varies with the energy available for the production process , and is not frozen at the threshold point .",
    "naturally , the two approximations coincide at threshold and the deviation between them increases with energy .",
    "the `` static approximation '' makes the pion exchange instantaneous and therefore neglects energy transfer .",
    "it is part of the usual non - relativistic approximation for exchange feynman diagrams .",
    "for the toy model case of scalar particles and scalar interactions , we verified the dominance of the dwba amplitude over the stretched boxes amplitude , as obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , our calculations show that the dwba keeps being dominant , as seen on the left panel of fig.[segfsi ] , even in a more pronounced way for the physical case considered here .",
    "we found also that within the scalar toy model all the approximations for the pion energy taken at the @xmath9 re - scattering amplitude overestimate the cross section , as found in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , on the right panel of fig.[segfsi ] , where we describe the nucleon - nucleon interaction by the bonn b potential t - matrix , only the on - shell @xmath17 approximation to the exact pion propagator gives a larger cross section ( on the right panel of fig.[segfsi ] this curve practically coincides with the reference result ) .",
    "the choice for the energy in the pion propagator is not very decisive , justifying the usual low - energy static or instantaneous approximation for exchange feynman diagrams .",
    "however , the choice for the energy of the exchanged pion for the re - scattering vertex , as prescribed from the 4-dimensional feynman diagram , is crucial for the cross section strength . as shown on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ segfsi ] , the fixed kinematics and the on - shell prescriptions for the re - scattering vertex are not suitable for combination with an energy independent @xmath2 potential .    both for the final- and initial - state interaction , our results show that the dwba formalism is quite adequate at threshold since this part of the full amplitude is clearly dominant over the stretched boxes . also , the effect of the usual choices for the @xmath1 re - scattering energy , which is not fixed by a non - relativistic formalism , can be significant .    in order to extract quantitatively from the data the unknown strength of the short - range mechanisms for the process @xmath18",
    ", one has to use for the pion exchange diagram the reference amplitudes .",
    "the latter were obtained as non - relativistic reductions of the corresponding feynman diagrams for the final- and initial - state interactions , respectively .",
