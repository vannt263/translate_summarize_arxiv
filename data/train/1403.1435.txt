    "the powerful star formation and nuclear activity that led to the buildup of massive galaxies through cosmic time have been the subject of many studies .",
    "most of these have focused on the cosmic time period elapsed between redshifts @xmath9 and 3 , when the cosmic star formation rate density had an overall peak @xcite , and the massive galaxy number density had a fast increase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at that time , stellar and nuclear activity were mostly obscured by dust , resulting in a high incidence of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "indeed , a substantial fraction of the most massive galaxies were ulirgs at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the study of powerful star formation activity over the first few billion years of cosmic time ( @xmath1 ) has proven to be more challenging , due to galaxy fainter fluxes , and the gradual decline of the cosmic star formation activity at high @xmath11 . a notable exception to this challenge",
    "is offered by the study of bright sub-/millimetre selected galaxies , whose redshift distribution has a significant tail at @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the sensitivity limits of current sub-/millimetre surveys only allows for the study of the most extreme examples of early dust - obscured star formation , while a plausible population of more typical star - forming ulirgs at @xmath1 is still to be found .",
    "an alternative approach for finding massive , dust - obscured starbursts at high @xmath11 consists of selecting bright mid - ir galaxies that are characterised by significantly red colours in their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "these red colours are the result of a redshifted 4000  @xmath12 break and/or significant dust extinction .",
    "for example , different works have shown that optically faint , mid - ir bright galaxies are mostly dusty starbursts lying at @xmath13 $ \\sim$}}~}2 $ ] , and some also host active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "restricting this selection to those sources in which the significant flux drop occurs at near - ir wavelengths ( observed @xmath14 ) should produce a redshift distribution biased towards even higher redshifts .",

    "the total times on - source were 11.9 and 2.6 hours for targets # 27564 and # 26857 , which produced maps with @xmath52 depths of 0.18 and 0.53  mjy / beam , respectively .",
    "the relative integration times have been decided based on the preliminary scuba2 source fluxes / positions available at the time of writing the pdbi proposal .",

    "the pdbi map shows a robust @xmath2 detection centred @xmath56  arcsec apart from the irac source centroid , which we can unambiguously identify with our @xmath0>4 $ ] target .",
    "figure  [ fig_maps26857 ] shows the corresponding maps for target # 26857 . on the pdbi 1.1  mm map a single source appears , with a marginal @xmath57 detection , located at a distance of 3.7  arcsec from our target centroid .",
    "note that this pdbi source is actually twice as bright as source # 27564 at 1.1  mm , but its detection is less significant due to the considerably shorter integration times .",
    "a @xmath57 detection on the pdbi map is below the threshold typically considered for robust detections at sub-/millimetre wavelengths ( i.e. , @xmath58 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the presence of a @xmath59 scuba2 source @xmath60  arcsec away , suggests that the pdbi detection could be the counterpart of the scuba2 source ( as the positions are consistent within the scuba2 positional uncertainty ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_maps26857 ] ) .",
    "note that the probability associated with a @xmath57 peak is approximately given by @xmath61 .",
    "about 17 independent pdbi beams are contained within the scuba2 positional error circle , which implies that the random probability that a pdbi @xmath57 peak lies within that area is only of @xmath62 . assuming a scuba2 positional uncertainty radius twice as large as that assumed here would still yield a small probability ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "therefore , these simple statistical arguments suggest that our pdbi @xmath57 detection is very likely real .",
    "however , we note that these arguments are not totally conclusive , as the probability associated with the s / n ratio given by @xmath64 should only be considered as an approximation .",
    "in any case , the significant separation between the pdbi @xmath57 source and our target centroid means that it is very unlikely that the millimetre ( and sub - millimetre ) emission is produced by our @xmath0>4 $ ] irac source .",
    "we discuss the possibilities for this pdbi detection in detail in section  [ sec - targ26 ] .        as for target # 27564",
    "the identification with the pdbi detection is unambiguous , we can combine the multi - wavelength information to investigate the dust emission properties of this source .",
    "figure  [ fig_sedi ] shows the dust ir sed for this target . to acknowledge the uncertainties in the redshift determination of this source , we analyse the two extreme values of the redshift interval with maximum probability , i.e. @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "note that , although there is a non - negligible probability that this source is at higher redshift , we deem that unlikely , as it is detected in the optical @xmath67 band with @xmath68  mag ( but is not detected in the uds deep @xmath45-band images ) .",
    "with photometry measured in only three bands in the wavelength range @xmath69 , and flux density upper limits in other two bands , we are unable to do a full spectral modelling of our target dust emission . however , from fig .  [ fig_sedi ] it is clear that a simple star - forming galaxy model can not reproduce the sub-/millimetre and mid - ir flux densities altogether .",
    "an additional dusty torus component is necessary to reproduce the total ir sed .",
    "we have performed an independent , self - consistent sed fitting from the uv through 1.1  mm using the grasil code @xcite , and obtained a similar result : at any of the possible redshifts , no pure star - forming galaxy model can account for the significant excess at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our target # 27564 is a composite agn / star - forming galaxy",
    ".    visual inspection of the _ hst _ images for this source in different bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig_hstzoom ] ) indicates that this galaxy has a more extended morphology towards longer wavelengths .",
    "this suggests the presence of an extended structure with dust - obscured star formation , in correspondence with the millimetre detection .",
    "note that this is not an apparent effect of the lack of sensitivity in the _ hst _ images at short wavelengths .",
    "target # 27564 has magnitudes @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath72 depth of the candels / uds f606w map is @xmath73  mag , so the source is well detected in this image , but considerably fainter than in the f160w map .",
    "based on our pdbi observed flux density at 1.1  mm , we can estimate the total infrared luminosity @xmath74 produced by star formation in our target .",
    "the obtained value depends on the adopted ir galaxy template .",
    "following michaowski et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , we scaled different , typical ir galaxy templates to the observed 1.1  mm flux density , obtaining @xmath75 .",
    "for any given template , the derived luminosities @xmath74 are similar at @xmath65 and @xmath66 , given that the flux dimming at higher @xmath11 is compensated by the negative @xmath76 correction . considering this range of @xmath74 values , and using the @xmath77 relation derived by kennicutt  ( 1998 ) , we estimate that the obscured sfr of our target is @xmath78 .",
    "note that this sfr would have been largely overestimated if it had been computed starting from the @xmath4 flux density , which is dominated by the dusty torus emission .",
    "the stellar mass derived for # 27564 is of @xmath79 at @xmath65 , and @xmath80 at @xmath66 , after correcting for the agn contamination , using a simple power - law component subtraction from the optical through irac band photometry ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these stellar - mass corrected values are @xmath81 of the uncorrected ones .",
    "note that , especially the value at @xmath66 , should still be considered as an upper limit of the real stellar mass . at this redshift , the irac",
    "bands only trace rest - frame wavelengths @xmath82 , and the hot - dust power - law component increasingly contaminates the normal galaxy sed up to rest - frame @xmath83 .",
    "thus , observing # 27564 at different wavelengths between observed 8 and @xmath4 is necessary to really weigh the impact of the agn power - law component , and derive a fully corrected stellar - mass value .",
    "target # 26857 is not detected on the pdbi map , but we can still attempt to constrain its ir dust sed from the photometric upper limits .",
    "figure  [ fig_sedii ] shows this sed at the minimum and maximum most likely redshifts for this source .",
    "this source is not detected in any of the uv / optical bands , so in this case we consider @xmath84 as the upper limit for the redshift ( note that a higher upper limit will not change the following analysis ) . at both extreme redshifts ,",
    "we have normalised the dusty star - forming galaxy template to the pdbi 1.1  mm flux density upper limit , which is the most restrictive one in the far - ir .    from fig .",
    "[ fig_sedii ] it is evident that the pure star - forming galaxy template adjusted to the 1.1  mm photometry could just be sufficient to reproduce the mid - ir ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) flux densities , if the galaxy were at @xmath65 .",
    "of course , this could have variations depending on the chosen star - forming galaxy template , but in any case a dusty torus component would be of minor importance ( unless , of course , the real flux densities at millimetre wavelengths are much lower than the upper limits ) . at higher redshifts ,",
    "a pure star - forming galaxy template is increasingly unable to adjust both the mid- and far - ir photometry , even for the 1.1  mm the flux density upper limit .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that it is likely that source # 26857 is also a composite agn / star - forming system .    as we have discussed in section [ sec - maps ] ,",
    "there is a tentative @xmath57 detection in the field of this source , but located at 3.7  arcsec from our target .",
    "so our target does not appear to be the counterpart of the pdbi / scuba2 source .",
    "the presence of a @xmath59 scuba2 @xmath43 source , whose position is consistent with that of our pdbi source within the error bars , suggests that the pdbi detection is likely real ( see discussion in  [ sec - maps ] ) .",
    "note that the scuba2 and pdbi flux densities are consistent with each other , considering a typical dust spectral slope of 3.5 - 4.0 .",
    "interestingly , no counterpart is found at the position of the pdbi detection on the candels @xmath55-band image , which is remarkable given the depth of the candels uds maps ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "even more surprisingly , no counterpart is found on the deep seds @xmath88 map .",
    "so , if the pdbi source is indeed real , then it will be similar in nature to the presumably rare source gn10 @xcite , which is very bright at sub - millimetre wavelengths , but extremely faint in the near - ir , and which has been confirmed to be at @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the pdbi flux density , along with all the photometric upper limits from the @xmath45 through the @xmath90 bands , are consistent with a gn10 sed .",
    "we note that these kinds of sources are probably not so rare as initially thought , given that another sub - millimetre source ( hdf 850.1 ) on the same field has been found to have similar properties to those of gn10 @xcite .",
    "another possibility could be that the pdbi source is a cold , dusty gas cloud that is associated with our target # 26857 .",
    "other cases similar to this have been reported in the literature .",
    "for example , ivison et al .  (",
    "2008 ) have found two sub - millimetre sources associated with a radio galaxy at @xmath91 , one of which does not have a counterpart in the irac bands or shorter wavelengths .",
    "they proposed that this sub - millimetre source could be a plume of cold , dusty gas tidally stripped from one of two merging agn . however , this plume of cold gas was much closer to its associated agn ( @xmath92 ) than what our pdbi detection would be from target # 26857 if it were at the same redshift ( @xmath93 at @xmath94 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the hypothesis that our pdbi detection and target # 26857 are physically associated is much less likely than the possibility that they are different sources .",
    "four additional @xmath0>4 $ ] sources in the c12 sample are detected at @xmath4 , albeit with fainter fluxes @xmath95 .",
    "we do not have pdbi observations for them , but we can nevertheless try to constrain their dust ir seds , using the scuba2 maps , and existing aztec 1.1  mm maps for the uds field @xcite .",
    "all of these sources lie in the coverage area of the scuba2 @xmath96 maps , and two of them in the @xmath97 coverage region .",
    "for the two sources with only @xmath96 coverage , no @xmath98 scuba2 detection is found within an 8  arcsec radius . in the fields of the other two sources , with coverage in both scuba2 bands ,",
    "there are respective scuba2 @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) detections with 4.8 ( 3.4@xmath99 ) , and 3.4 ( @xmath100 ) significance .",
    "however , in each case , the scuba2 centroid is more than 6  arcsec away from our @xmath0>4 $ ] source centroid ( fig .",
    "[ fig_othstamps ] ) , so it is very unlikely that any of these scuba2 sources corresponds to an irac @xmath0>4 $ ] source .",
    "note that in the case of the scuba2 @xmath96 detection with @xmath101 confidence ( upper panels in fig .",
    "[ fig_othstamps ] ) , there are two other clear irac / wfc3 sources within the sub - millimetre positional uncertainty circle , so one of them ( or both ) are the likely correct counterparts . in the case of the scuba2 @xmath96 detection with @xmath102 confidence ( bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig_othstamps ] ) , one would be tempted to associate the scuba2 source with the @xmath0>4 $ ] galaxy . however , given the results of our pdbi observations towards target # 26857 , we suspect that this association would likely be wrong .",
    "therefore , for the study of the ir dust seds of all our four additional @xmath0>4 $ ] sources with @xmath4 detections , we consider that none of them is detected in the scuba2 maps , and we use flux density upper limits for the scuba2 bands that cover the field of our sources .",
    "figure  [ fig_sedoth ] shows the dust ir seds for these four sources altogether .",
    "we only include here a pure dusty star - forming ir galaxy model , normalised to the most restrictive of the sub - millimetre photometric upper limits .",
    "these plots illustrate that , for any of these @xmath0>4 $ ] sources , such a model is sufficient to account for both the mid - ir photometry and sub-/millimetre upper limits at @xmath65 .",
    "if the sources were at much higher redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath103 ) , and/or the sub - millimetre fluxes were significantly lower than the scuba2 upper limits , then a dusty torus component would be needed . in conclusion , even when we can not completely exclude the need for a dusty torus , the existing ir photometry indicates that not all of the @xmath0>4 $ ] sources are expected to have an important agn component , as it is the case for our pdbi target # 27564 , and also likely for # 26857 .",
    "our pdbi detections towards two extremely red @xmath0>4 $ ] galaxies at @xmath1 are important for the following reasons .",
    "@xmath104 target # 27564 has a clear , @xmath2-confidence millimetre counterpart , which confirms that this is a massive , agn / star - forming composite galaxy at high redshifts .",
    "the millimetre flux density , which is completely dominated by star formation , indicates that this galaxy has an ir luminosity due to star formation @xmath105 , corresponding to @xmath106 .",
    "this implies that , from the star - formation point of view , this source is not like the typical hyper - luminous sub-/millimetre sources discovered thus far with single - dish millimetre telescopes at @xmath107 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "rather , it is a modest ulirg at @xmath1 , such as those more commonly found by ir galaxy surveys at @xmath108 .",
    "preliminary results on sub - millimetre number counts in deep alma observations @xcite suggest that , if the redshift distribution of faint sub - millimetre galaxies is comparable to that of the brighter sources currently known , then many more examples of these ordinary ulirgs should be discovered at @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath104 there is a tentative pdbi @xmath7 detection at a distance of 3.7  arcsec of our target # 26857 .",
    "the most likely scenario is that the two sources are unrelated , and the lack of another _ spitzer _ or _ hst _ counterpart suggests that the pdbi detection corresponds to a new example of a very dusty starburst , like gn10 , at high @xmath11 .",
    "our pdbi source also reveals that our @xmath0>4 $ ] galaxy is not the counterpart of the scuba2 detection in the same field , as a simple identification of the scuba2 source with the brightest irac source in the field would suggest .",
    "one could wonder whether the discovery of this new dusty source in the field of our target # 26857 is simply fortuitous .",
    "we believe that it likely is not : these red high-@xmath11 sources tend to be highly clustered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so our finding of a gn10-like candidate source close to our @xmath0>4 $ ] target should perhaps not come as a surprise .",
    "however , this is not necessarily expected for all @xmath0>4 $ ] galaxies , as some of them do not have any close scuba2 detection ( neither robust nor tentative ) .",
    "the analysis of the dusty ir seds of other @xmath0>4 $ ] galaxies suggests that not all of them are characterised by an important agn component . at redshifts @xmath109 ,",
    "a pure dusty ir star - forming galaxy model is able to reproduce the mid - ir photometry and the sub-/millimetre photometric upper limits in all cases .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our pdbi targets # 27564 and # 26857 could be prototypical of the brightest irac @xmath0>4 $ ] galaxies , but not all of them .    as a general conclusion",
    ", we argue that the analysis of ultra - deep near and mid - ir data offers an alternative route to discover new sites of powerful star - formation activity over the first few billion years of cosmic time .",
    "we also conclude that associations between single - dish sub - millimetre sources and bright irac galaxies can be quite uncertain in some cases , and interferometric observations are necessary to study the dust - obscured star formation properties of the @xmath0>4 $ ] galaxies .    based on observations carried out with the iram pdbi .",

    "<S> we report plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) 1.1  mm continuum imaging towards two extremely red @xmath0>4 $ ]  ( ab ) galaxies at @xmath1 , which we have previously discovered making use of _ spitzer _ seds and _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",

    "<S> one of our objects is detected on the pdbi map with a @xmath2 significance , corresponding to @xmath3 . by combining this detection with </S>",
    "<S> the _ spitzer _ 8 and @xmath4 photometry for this source , and scuba2 flux density upper limits , we infer that this galaxy is a composite active galactic nucleus / star - forming system . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared ( ir)-derived star formation rate is @xmath5 , which implies that this galaxy is a higher - redshift analogue of the ordinary ultra - luminous infrared galaxies more commonly found at @xmath6 . in the field of the other target , we find a tentative @xmath7 detection on the pdbi 1.1  mm map , but 3.7  arcsec away of our target position , so it likely corresponds to a different object . in spite of the lower significance , the pdbi detection is supported by a close scuba2 @xmath8 detection . </S>",
    "<S> no counterpart is found on either the deep seds or candels maps , so , if real , the pdbi source could be similar in nature to the sub - millimetre source gn10 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the analysis of ultra - deep near- and mid - ir images offers an efficient , alternative route to discover new sites of powerful star formation activity at high redshifts . </S>"
