    "astrophysics and cosmology provide a natural testing ground for virtually any new idea in the area of elementary particle physics .",
    "usually one may first think of the early universe or perhaps high - energy cosmic rays when searching for astrophysical arguments in favor or against a new particle - physics model . however , there are a number of interesting cases where the low energies available in stars are quite sufficient for rather useful and restrictive tests of high - energy physics phenomena .",
    "the basic idea is very simple .",
    "stars are powerful sources for weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos , gravitons , hypothetical axions , and other new particles that can be produced by nuclear reactions or by thermal processes in the hot stellar interior .",
    "the solar neutrino flux is now routinely measured with such precision that compelling evidence for neutrino oscillations has accumulated . the measured neutrino burst from supernova ( sn )",
    "1987a has been used to derive many useful limits . even when the particle flux can not be measured directly",
    ", the absence of visible decay products , notably x- or @xmath0-rays , can provide important information .",
    "the properties of stars themselves would change if they lost too much energy into a new channel .",
    "this `` energy - loss argument '' has been widely used to constrain a long list of particles and particle properties .",
    "all of this has been extensively reviewed  @xcite and is now widely appreciated among particle physicists  @xcite .",
    "therefore , instead of reviewing once more the general ideas i will rather focus on two topical examples of current interest that nicely illustrate the overall methods .",
    "one is the search for solar axions by the cast experiment at cern ( sec .  2 ) .",
    "the other is the possibility that space - time has large extra dimensions .",
    "this hypothesis predicts a `` tower '' of graviton modes that can be produced in stars , notably in sn cores or neutron stars .",
    "the most restrictive limits on the size of the extra dimensions arises from the astrophysical arguments presented in sec .",
    "a brief summary and outlook is given in sec .",
    "axions are hypothetical particles that are predicted in the context of a theoretical scheme to solve the cp problem of strong interactions  @xcite .",
    "this is the problem that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ought to violate the cp symmetry in that the neutron should have a large electric dipole moment , contrary to experimental evidence .",
    "this observation can be explained by a new symmetry , the peccei - quinn symmetry , that is spontaneously broken at some large energy scale @xmath1 , the peccei - quinn scale or axion decay constant .",
    "axions are the `` almost '' nambu - goldstone bosons of this new symmetry and as such nearly massless .",
    "phenomenologically one should think of axions as the neutral pion s little brother .",
    "model - dependent details aside , the axion s mass and couplings are given by those of the @xmath2 , scaled with @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pion decay constant .",
    "the axion decay constant @xmath1 is a free parameter and thus can be very large .",
    "therefore , axions can be very light and very weakly interacting even though they are fundamentally a qcd phenomenon .",
    "there are other plausible solutions of the strong cp problem",
    ". however , the peccei - quinn approach is particularly elegant and predicts something new  in the guise of axions it provides a handle for a possible experimental verification .",
    "moreover , axions can play the role of the cosmic cold dark matter  @xcite . therefore",
    ", two fundamental problems would be solved by the existence of one new particle .",
    "the experimental search for axions has focused on their predicted interaction with the electromagnetic field that would be of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electromagnetic field - strength tensor , @xmath7 its dual , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 the electric and magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "the coupling strength is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ratio of the electromagnetic and color anomalies , a model - dependent ratio of small integers .",
    "one popular case is the dfsz model where @xmath12 , another the ksvs model where @xmath13 , but there are more general examples  @xcite .    assuming @xmath14 for the axion mass , fig .",
    "[ fig : axgam ] shows @xmath15 as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "the diagonal band marked `` axion models '' is somewhat arbitrarily delimited by the dfsz and ksvz models .",
    "the role of axions or axion - like particles is frequently assessed in the full two - dimensional @xmath15-@xmath16-space rather than the narrow band defined by conventional axion models , although this band remains the best - motivated location in this parameter space .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction allows for the two - photon decay @xmath17 with a rate @xmath18 .",
    "this process is very slow if the axion mass is small and the coupling strength is weak .",
    "therefore , it is more promising to consider the analogous process where one of the photons is virtual , i.e.  an external electric or magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath19 conversion in the presence of an external @xmath20 or @xmath21 field is known as the primakoff process ; it was first considered for neutral pions half a century ago  @xcite .",
    "if axions are the galactic dark matter , they can be detected in the laboratory by the `` haloscope '' technique  @xcite .",
    "one places a tunable high - q microwave cavity in a strong magnetic field and measures the power output .",
    "if the resonance frequency matches @xmath16 , the primakoff - conversion can produce a measurable signal .",
    "two pilot experiments  @xcite and a first full - scale search  @xcite exclude a range of coupling strength shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : axgam ] that is marked `` haloscope . ''",
    "the new generation of experiments in livermore  @xcite and kyoto  @xcite should cover the dashed area in fig .  [",
    "fig : axgam ] , perhaps leading to the discovery of axion dark matter .     as a function of axion mass @xmath16 .",
    "the limits apply to any axion - like particle except for the `` haloscope '' search which assumes that axions are the galactic dark matter ; the dotted region marks the projected sensitivity range of the ongoing full - scale searches .",
    "limits for higher masses than shown here are reviewed in ref .",
    "the light - grey region marks the foreseen cast sensitivity.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in a different region of masses and couplings axions are detectable with a related technique called the `` helioscope ''  @xcite .",
    "thermal photons in the solar interior convert to axions by the primakoff process in the microscopic electric fields of charged particles , producing a solar axion flux which peaks at energies of a few kev .",
    "if one views the sun through a long dipole magnet , the axions partially back - convert into photons and become visible as x - rays at the far end of the magnet . a dedicated search for this effect by the tokyo axion helioscope  @xcite excludes the dark - grey region in fig .",
    "[ fig : axgam ] .    the conversion rate in the helioscope scales quadratically with the length @xmath22 and field - strength @xmath21 of the conversion region .",
    "therefore , one can do much better in the new cast project at cern where a de - commissioned lhc test magnet is used as a `` magnetic telescope '' to search for solar axions  @xcite . mounted on a movable platform ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cast ] ) allowing @xmath23 horizontal and @xmath24 vertical tracking , this instrument can achieve about 33 full days of alignment with the sun per year . if we express the coupling strength as @xmath25 , the solar axion flux at earth",
    "is @xmath26 .",
    "the conversion probability in the magnet is @xmath27 .",
    "for the two magnet bores with a cross section of @xmath28 we thus expect an x - ray event rate of @xmath29 per day of exposure time .    in order to reach the sensitivity shown as a light - grey area in fig .",
    "[ fig : axgam ] one needs to make great efforts to suppress background counts .",
    "one way is to focus the x - rays to a small detector region .",
    "specifically , an engineering model for the seven x - ray telescopes of the abrixas satellite has become available for this purpose and has been tested to be in good working condition .",
    "cast should be able to take first data shortly , i.e.  in the summer or fall of 2002 .",
    "figure  [ fig : axgam ] shows a loss of sensitivity for about @xmath30 .",
    "the axion - photon conversion should be pictured as a phenomenon similar to neutrino oscillations  @xcite . for larger @xmath16 the oscillation length becomes shorter than the magnet and the effective mixing angle is suppressed .",
    "this `` momentum mismatch '' between axions and photons can be overcome by giving the photons a refractive mass by virtue of a low-@xmath31 gas such as helium .",
    "this approach was successfully employed in the tokyo helioscope  @xcite and will be used in cast as well .",
    "we may extend the sensitivity range to larger masses as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : axgam ] and in the neighborhood of @xmath32 actually bite into the parameter range of conventional axion models .    at somewhat larger masses axions",
    "are already ruled out by a telescope search for spectral lines from @xmath17 decay in galaxy clusters @xcite . in the few - ev mass range axions would have been in thermal equilibrium in the early universe and contribute a small hot - dark matter component .",
    "if we use the sun as an axion source we must be sure that our sensitivity range is not excluded by an excessive modification of stellar properties by the axionic energy loss .",
    "an observable modification of the solar p - mode frequencies excludes @xmath15 values above the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig : axgam ] marked `` sun ''  @xcite .",
    "significantly smaller couplings are excluded because the energy - loss of horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars would shorten their helium - burning lifetime , reducing the relative number of hb stars observed in globular clusters  @xcite ; see the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig : axgam ] marked `` hb stars . ''",
    "the cast experiment advances into uncharted territory .    for very small axion masses ,",
    "however , the cast sensitivity range is already excluded by an argument involving sn  1987a .",
    "axions would have been produced in the hot sn core by the primakoff effect , and then would have back - converted into @xmath0-rays in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the non - observation of a @xmath0-ray burst in the smm instrument in coincidence with the observed sn  1987a neutrinos excludes @xmath15 values above the line marked sn  1987a @xcite .",
    "this limit applies only for about @xmath33 ; for larger masses the conversion is suppressed by the mass difference relative to photons .",
    "the magnetically induced transition from photons to axion - like particles in intergalactic space has been proposed as a mechanism that would make distant photon sources look dimmer , with important consequences for the interpretation of the sn ia hubble diagram @xcite .",
    "the relevant masses are very small , again to avoid suppressing the transition by a large axion - photon mass difference .",
    "therefore , the relevant @xmath15 range is limited by the sn  1987a argument and thus falls outside the cast sensitivity range .",
    "the planck scale of about @xmath34  gev , relevant for gravitation , is very much larger than the electroweak scale of about 1  tev of the particle - physics standard model .",
    "a radical new approach to solving this notorious hierarchy problem holds that there could be large extra dimensions , the main idea being that the standard - model fields are confined to a 3 + 1 dimensional brane embedded in a higher dimensional bulk where only gravity is allowed to propagate  @xcite .",
    "this concept immediately puts stringent constraints on the size of the extra dimensions because newton s law holds at any scale which has thus far been observed , i.e.  down to about 1  mm .",
    "extra dimensions can only appear at a smaller scale .",
    "following common practice the new dimensions are taken to form an @xmath35-torus of the same radius @xmath36 in each direction . the planck scale of the full higher dimensional space , @xmath37 , can be related to the normal planck scale , .",
    "limits on @xmath37 in this system of units have been reviewed in ref .",
    "@xmath38 , by gauss law  @xcite @xmath39 therefore , if @xmath36 is large then @xmath37 can be much smaller than @xmath40 .",
    "if this scenario is to solve the hierarchy problem then @xmath37 must be close to the electroweak scale , i.e.  @xmath41100  tev .",
    "this requirement already excludes @xmath42 because @xmath43  tev corresponds to @xmath44  cm .",
    "however , @xmath45 remains possible , and particularly for @xmath46 there is the intriguing perspective that the extra dimensions could be accessible to experiments probing gravity at scales below 1  mm .    the most restrictive limits on @xmath47 obtain from supernovae and neutron stars .",
    "the first example is the sn  1987a energy - loss argument .",
    "if large extra dimensions exist , the usual 4d graviton is complemented by a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states , corresponding to new phase space in the bulk .",
    "these kk gravitons would be emitted from the sn core after collapse by nucleon bremsstrahlung @xmath48 .",
    "the kk gravitons interact with the strength of ordinary gravitons and thus are not trapped in the sn core .",
    "however , this energy - loss channel can compete with neutrino cooling because of the large multiplicity of kk modes and shorten the observable signal  @xcite .",
    "this argument has led to the tight bound @xmath49 m ( @xmath50  tev ) for @xmath46 and @xmath51  nm ( @xmath52  tev ) for @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "the kk gravitons emitted by all core - collapse sne over the age of the universe produce a cosmological background of these particles .",
    "later they decay into all standard - model particles which are kinematically allowed ; for the relatively low - mass modes produced by a sn the only channels are @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the relevant decay rates are @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "therefore , over the age of the universe a significant fraction of the produced kk modes has decayed into photons , contributing to the diffuse cosmic @xmath0-ray background observed by egret .",
    "this argument implies that if the number of extra dimensions @xmath46 or 3 , their radius @xmath36 must be about a factor of 10 smaller than implied by the sn  1987a cooling limit , i.e.  for @xmath46 one finds @xmath58  mm or @xmath59  tev .",
    "for @xmath53 the new limit is @xmath60  mm or @xmath61  tev @xcite .",
    "this , however , is not the end of the story .",
    "we later realized that the kk gravitons emitted by the sn core will stay gravitationally trapped because most of them are produced near their kinematical threshold , i.e.  with barely relativistic velocities  @xcite .",
    "therefore , every neutron star is surrounded by a halo of kk gravitons which is dark except for the decays into @xmath62 neutrinos , @xmath55 pairs and @xmath0-rays . in principle , this radiation can be directly observed .",
    "conversely , the non - observation allows one to set stringent limits .",
    "in addition , the radiation impinges on the neutron star , keeping it hot , above the observed temperature in some cases such as the pulsar psr j0953 + 0755 .",
    "one obtains the limit @xmath63 for @xmath46 and @xmath64 for @xmath53 . in view of these limits",
    "one expects that if large extra dimensions solve the hierarchy problem , their number @xmath35 should probably exceed  4 .",
    "similar arguments can be applied to other particles than gravitons that may exist and may be able to propagate in the bulk of the larger - dimensional space .",
    "the hypothetical majorons are one case in point  @xcite .",
    "of course , there are loop holes to such limits .",
    "the size of the extra dimensions need not be equal , or there can be other than toroidal compactifications .",
    "the kk gravitons may be able to decay fast into invisible channels , and so forth",
    ". however , our main point is that straightforward astrophysical arguments lead to non - trivial and restrictive limits on the structure of this new theory .",
    "stars continue to provide some of the most restrictive limits on new particle - physics ideas .",
    "the much - discussed hypothesis that our space - time has extra dimensions that are compactified on the sub - millimeter scale is a recent case in point .",
    "in addition to deriving limits , there are opportunities for new discoveries .",
    "the cast experiment at cern searching for solar axions will have a sensitivity range that for the first time pushes beyond stellar - evolution limits and thus has a realistic chance of actually finding axion - like particles emitted by the sun .    in future the observation of solar neutrinos",
    "will continue to provide valuable information .",
    "the ongoing efforts in neutrino physics virtually guarantee that large detectors will operate for many years to come ; even a megatonne detector may be built to search for proton decay and to perform precision measurements at laboratory neutrino beams .",
    "therefore , chances are that one will measure the neutrino burst from a galactic supernova , providing high - statistics information both on the sn event and a host of information of particle physics interest .",
    "the recent excitement about the possible discovery of strange - matter stars @xcite , even though not conclusive , illustrates that compact stars offer one of the few opportunities to discover the true ground state of nuclear matter .",
    "astroparticle physics is now an established research activity at the interface between inner space and outer space .",
    "the physics and observationd of stellar objects continue to offer a number of intriguing opportunities in this multi - faceted and interdisciplinary field .",
