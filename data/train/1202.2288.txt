    "recent progress in single - electron tunneling spectroscopy have revealed the persistence of pairing effect even at very small number of particles @xcite .",
    "the tremendous experimental work in ultra - small metallic grains @xcite has enabled to systematically investigate the transition from large systems , the bulk limit , up to very small systems . by varying the number of particles , thermal excitations or adding external magnetic fields , the smearing of superfluid - to - normal phase transition , the survival of pairing correlations , the odd - even staggering @xcite and/or possible re - entrant effects @xcite have been carefully analyzed .",
    "these studies have underlined the importance of finite size effect on pairing correlations and the necessity to develop theories beyond the bardeen - cooper - schieffer ( bcs ) or the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) ones that properly account for particle number conservation .",
    "some of these studies are at the crossroad with nuclear physics where systems contain very few to several hundreds of nucleons @xcite and some of the approaches that are used nowadays to deal with particle number conservation , like projection techniques @xcite have been imported in condensed matter @xcite . in this case ,",
    "improvement beyond the bcs and/or hfb , is obtained by considering a state with good particle @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the projector on @xmath2 particles while @xmath3 denotes a quasi - particle ( bcs or hfb ) state .",
    "the explicitly breaking of the symmetry , the @xmath4 one in the present case , allows to grasp the physics of pairing while its restoration is required to describe the onset of pairing in very small systems ( see for instance fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a natural extension of this approach able to provide a canonical description of finite system at thermal equilibrium has been proposed already some times ago @xcite by considering a many - body projected density @xmath5 written as ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the quasi - particle effective bcs or hfb hamiltonian . in view of the complexity of this approach , approximations or alternative theories",
    "have been proposed . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a general projection formalism was developed and largely applied in the static - path - approximation .",
    "the problem of particle number projection at finite temperature was also addressed in the context of the thermofield dynamic @xcite but no applications have been done till now .",
    "starting from a mean - field plus pairing description in the grand - canonical ensemble , several improvements of increasing complexity have been proposed to correct from particle number explicit non - conservation . along this line ,",
    "a modified bcs theory @xcite has been introduced where part of the statistical fluctuations is directly incorporated in the quasi - particle transformation .",
    "this approach has been further improved by extending the lipkin - nogami approach to finite temperature , projecting onto good particle number after variation or adding quantum fluctuation associated to rpa modes @xcite .",
    "note however that its justification and applicability especially at high temperature remain to be clarified @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "starting from a functional integral formulation and treating approximately the collective fluctuations around the mean - field path , is shown to provide a suitable tool over a wide range of temperatures but breaks down at very low temperature @xcite .",
    "an approximate scheme to deal with quantal fluctuations consists in the use of a grand - canonical plus a parity - projected technique @xcite which allows to describe qualitatively odd - even effects but still suffers from of abrupt and/or spurious phase transitions @xcite .",
    "even in very schematic models @xcite , unless an exact treatment is made either by direct diagonalization @xcite or by quantum monte - carlo techniques @xcite , a canonical finite - t method based on mean - field theory and valid at arbitrary small or high temperature remains problematic and appears as a challenge in this field @xcite .    while the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite were very promising , this method has never been applied due to its complexity . here , we apply for the first time the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to the richardson hamiltonian at thermal equilibrium and show that this approach provides a proper description of both thermal and quantal fluctuations from very low to high temperature",
    ". the canonical description of a quantum finite system can be obtained by minimizing the helmholtz free energy @xmath10 @xmath11 - t s ) = 0 , \\label{eq : varia}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denotes the entropy associated to the projected density ( [ eq : dn ] ) , i.e. @xmath13 . the approach is applied to the pairing hamiltonian written as @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an external magnetic field . for not too big systems , thermodynamic quantities can be studied in different statistical ensembles without approximation by direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian in different seniority spaces@xcite .    the results discussed below are obtained for a system of @xmath16 doubly - folded equidistant levels whose energies are @xmath17 and a pairing strength @xmath18 . in the following , the total energy , pairing gap and the temperature",
    "are given in units of @xmath19 .",
    "to take advantage of the @xmath4 symmetry breaking , the hamiltonian @xmath9 is written as a sum of quasi - particle excitations @xmath20 , where the @xmath21 denotes the eigenvalues of the underlying hfb hamiltonian , while the quasi - particle creation operators write @xmath22 similarly to what is done in nuclear physics , two levels of complexity exist in the application of projection techniques .",
    "the projection can be made either before ( variation after projection [ vap ] ) or after ( projection after variation [ pav ] ) variation@xcite .",
    "the latter is much less demanding since it only requires to solve finite temperature bcs ( ft - bcs ) equations and make projection without minimizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : varia ] ) . as an illustration ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the energy @xmath23 and the associated heat capacity defined through @xmath24 obtained with ft - bcs ( dashed line ) and ft - pav ( dotted line ) are compared to the exact result ( thick line ) in figure [ fig1:vapt ] for @xmath25 particles .",
    "the exact solution is obtained following ref .",
    "@xcite .     particles . ]    as it is well know , in addition to the systematic overestimation of the energy , the ft - bcs theory suffers from the sharp superfluid to normal phase transition as the temperature increases . on opposite , the exact solution display a much smoother behaviour .",
    "it is clearly seen in this figure that , except in the very small temperature case , the ft - bcs+pav does even a worse job and does not cure the threshold effect .    extrapolating the improvement generally observed at @xmath26 @xcite to the finite temperature case",
    ", one can anticipate a much better description if vap is performed . in that case , the variational principle ( [ eq : varia ] ) should be minimized by both varying the components @xmath27 and the energy @xmath21 consistently @xcite .",
    "while in principle possible , such minimization has never been performed due to the fact that the hamiltonian @xmath9 and the operator @xmath28 do not commute and therefore can not be diagonalized simultaneously . as a consequence , while a guideline of practical implementation has been proposed long ago in @xcite , except in the case of the two - level degenerate system , the predictive power of vap at finite temperature ( called hereafter ft - vap ) has never been attested .    in the present work , we applied the ft - vap following the strategy proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in practice ,",
    "the variational principle is minimized by writing first the energy in terms of the one- and two - body density of the projected density , both of them written as a non - trivial function of the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath21 ( see eq .",
    "( 36 ) in ref .",
    "the minimization is carried out via a sequential quadratic programming method by using the @xmath30 and @xmath21 as variational parameters . to compute the free energy without approximation , at each iteration of the minimization ,",
    "the entropy is calculated by @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the eigenvalues of the statistical operator @xmath33 in the fock space composed by all the many - body configurations with @xmath2 particles .",
    "each configuration is characterized by @xmath34 pairs and @xmath35 unpaired particles , with 2@xmath36 . moreover , since states with a different number of unpaired particles can not be connected by the operator @xmath37 , the problem is reduced to the diagonalization of block matrices for each allowed seniority i. the required computational cost is thus given essentially by two operations , i.e. the calculation of the matrix elements of the statistical operators and the diagonalization itself .",
    "for the latter , a standard qr algorithm is used .",
    "the calculation of the matrix elements is done by using the bit representation of the many - body states ( see for example ref .",
    "each configuration is identified by an integer word whose bits correspond to the single particle levels and have value 1 or 0 depending on whether the level is occupied or empty .",
    "in such a way all the matrix elements can be obtained by using very simple logical operations which allow to perform calculations much faster .    in figure",
    "[ fig2:vapt ] , the result obtained in ft - vap is compared to the exact solution for a system of @xmath25 particles at various temperature . in ft - vap",
    ", the gap is given by eq .",
    "( 42 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite while in the exact case it is computed through : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total exact energy and @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 containing both the single - particle and the self - energy terms , @xmath42 being the occupation numbers . in this figure , we see that , except for the small systematic difference observed for the gap , the ft - vap approach provides a perfect description of the thermodynamics of a system with fixed particle number in any range of temperature .",
    "none of the limitations @xcite appearing in other mean - field based theories are seen .",
    "in particular , the entropy , that is an approximation in ft - vap , perfectly matches the exact one . the same quality of agreement",
    "is found also at higher temperature ( up to t= 10 ) .    , the entropy , the heat capacity and the average gap obtained with the ft - vap ( filled circles ) are compared to the exact ( thick line ) and ft - bcs case ( dashed line ) for a system of @xmath25 particles . ]",
    "we further investigated the applicability of ft - vap for odd number of particles .",
    "taking advantage of the fact that the ft - bcs density mixes up odd and even parities as soon as a non - zero temperature is applied , we used the same technique as in the even case .",
    "the only difference is that now the projector entering in the density ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn ] ) ) corresponds to an odd number of particles . in top panel of figure",
    "[ fig3:vapt ] , the pairing gap obtained in ft - vap for @xmath25 and @xmath43 particles is compared to the exact case . in bottom panel of this figure ,",
    "the spin susceptibility @xmath44 defined as @xcite    @xmath45    is shown for the two cases .    in the limit of small magnetic field",
    ", the susceptibility identifies with the fluctuation of the magnetization @xmath46 @xcite , i.e. @xmath47 in small systems , large differences are observed in the thermodynamics of odd and even systems @xcite .",
    "this is clearly seen especially at low temperature for the gap .",
    "the spin susceptibility further underlines the differences .",
    "the ft - vap perfectly grasps the thermodynamics of odd systems and one can not distinguish its result from the exact solution .",
    "( filled circles ) and @xmath43 ( open squares ) particles as a function of @xmath48 obtained with the ft - vap .",
    "the corresponding exact result for the even and odd systems are presented respectively with solid and dashed lines . in this figure",
    ", the spin susceptibility is normalized by the bulk high temperature value @xmath49 . ]    in the present letter , we applied for the first time the variation after projection approach to describe the canonical properties of a superconducting system .",
    "the minimization of the free energy is made with no approximation on the entropy .",
    "the ft - vap provides a perfect reproduction of the exact result in the richardson hamiltonian case both in the low and high temperature limit and does not have the limitation of other mean - field based approaches .",
    "due to the necessity to make use of explicit diagonalization for the entropy , the present approach is still restricted to rather small number of particles .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the result obtained here is sufficiently promising that in the near future , an effort should be made to promote the ft - vap and make it more versatile .",
    "it should be mentioned that the present method provides a natural extension of the ft - bcs or ft - hfb theory presently used to describe nuclei within the energy density functional framework applied at finite temperature @xcite .",
