    "rubble piles are bodies composed of smaller elements separated by voids .",
    "there is compelling evidence that at least some small solar system bodies are rubble piles bound by gravity .",
    "their telltale signature is a mean density below that of their constituent elements .",
    "examples include : four icy satellites of saturn , the coorbitals , janus and epimetheus , and the f - ring shepherds , prometheus and pandora @xcite , the rocky main belt asteroids , c - type 253 mathilde @xcite and m - type 22 kalliope @xcite , and the binary near - earth asteroid 1999 kw4 @xcite .",
    "the largest of these bodies , janus and kalliope , have dimensions of order @xmath7 .",
    "it is unclear whether larger rubble piles exist or whether all smaller bodies are rubble piles .",
    "intuitively we expect a rubble pile to be weaker than a monolithic body of the same composition .",
    "thus tidal dissipation at a rate that is more rapid than typical for a monolith is considered evidence for a rubble pile @xcite .",
    "the orbits of binary near - earth asteroids are prime examples ; the sizes of their semimajor axes and their low orbital eccentricities suggest that they are evolving tidally at rates between @xmath5 and @xmath6 times faster than estimates for monolithic bodies of similar size would predict @xcite . in what follows , we provide a theoretical basis for estimating tidal dissipation rates in rubble piles and show that it can account for this large speedup of tidal evolution .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in  [ sec : modulus ] , we formulate a quantitative theory for the effective rigidity of a self - gravitating rubble pile and demonstrate that it is due to voids rather than cracks .",
    "limits on the sizes of rubble piles are derived in  [ sec : sizes ] . in  [ sec : tides ] , we apply our theory to the tidal evolution of binary near - earth asteroids .",
    "we begin by reviewing the tidal response of a uniform body of density @xmath8 , rigidity @xmath9 , and radius @xmath10 .",
    "as is customary , we define the dimensionless rigidity by @xmath1 ; @xmath11 next we show that @xmath1 is the ratio of the fluid strain to the elastic strain .",
    "we assume that the tidal force , @xmath12 , is weak in comparison to the cohesive force of the body s self gravity , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "if the body were fluid , @xmath15 , it would suffer a strain @xmath16 whereas if it were elastic but lacked self - gravity , @xmath17 , the strain would be @xmath18 to order of magnitude , the ratio between expressions and reproduces @xmath1 given by equation .",
    "how does the tidal response of a rubble pile differ from that of a monolith ? to answer this question , we investigate some simple models .",
    "normal stresses are seamlessly transmitted across cracks , so a body s response to weak tides is unaffected by cracks .",
    "consider a body of radius @xmath10 composed of cubical elements whose sides have length @xmath19 .",
    "the ratio of the weight of a single cube , @xmath20 , to the divergence of tidal stress acting on its volume , @xmath21 , is just @xmath22 .",
    "thus a coefficient of static friction larger than @xmath23 would suffice to prevent the cubes from slipping relative to each other .",
    "coefficients of static friction for rocks and dry ice are of order unity , and @xmath24 for an equal mass binary with semi - major axis @xmath25 .",
    "next we consider a body of radius @xmath10 composed of identical spheres of radius @xmath26 .",
    "its mean density @xmath27 .",
    "a typical cross section cuts @xmath28 small spheres each of which transmits forces @xmath29 to its neighbors , where @xmath30 includes both tidal forces and self gravity . in so doing ,",
    "each small sphere undergoes a linear distortion @xmath31 and forms contact surfaces with its neighbors of area @xmath32 . within @xmath33 of each contact , the strain is of order @xmath34 so @xmath35 the average strain is just @xmath36 , where from equation @xmath37 most of this strain is due to the body s self - gravity . to isolate the tidal strain , we expand @xmath38 in equation around @xmath39 to obtain @xmath40 thus the effective dimensionless tidal rigidity of a body composed of identical spheres is @xmath41 this result is equivalent to that originally established by @xcite .",
    "natural rubble piles are likely to be composed of irregularly shaped elements whose surfaces have local radii of curvature , @xmath42 , that are much smaller than the elements sizes , @xmath43 .",
    "compared to rubble piles composes of spheres , contact areas would be reduced , stress concentrations increased , and the effective rigidity lowered .",
    "a simple modification of the derivation given in [ subsubsec : spheres ] suffices to evaluate the effective rigidity of a rubble pile , @xmath0 .",
    "each element still transmits its share of the total force .",
    "however , @xmath42 must replace @xmath43 on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : balance ] ) .",
    "thus now @xmath44 continuing as before , we find that the average strain across the rubble pile is increased by the factor @xmath45 with the consequence that the effective rigidity now reads @xmath46 the sharper the contact points , the softer the rubble pile , up to a limit at which the stress near the contact surfaces reaches the material s yield stress @xmath47 , or yield strain @xmath48 .",
    "this limit is met at @xmath49 sharper contact points than allowed by equation would be dulled by material flow or failure . therefore , @xmath50 experimentally it is generally found that the effective rigidity of a granular material scales in direct proportion to the square root of the confining pressure .",
    "@xcite provides an explanation for this scaling which is similar to ours .",
    "equations ( [ eq : muspheres ] ) and demonstrate that the effective rigidity of a rubble pile is smaller than that of a monolithic body of the same size .",
    "the reduction in rigidity is independent of the sizes of the elements into which the body is divided .",
    "it arises from the concentration of stresses due to the presence of voids .",
    "we re - derive equation based on energy considerations .",
    "strains of order @xmath51 are attained within a distance @xmath52 of the contacts between individual elements .",
    "thus the elastic energy stored within the rubble pile satisfies @xmath53 we can also express @xmath54 in terms of the effective dimensionless rigidity , @xmath55 and the average strain in the rubble pile , @xmath36 as @xmath56 equating the expressions for @xmath54 given in equations and , we arrive at @xmath57 finally , by using equation to eliminate @xmath58 , we recover equation .",
    "at @xmath59 which corresponds to @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for nominal values of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 for rubble piles composed of either rock or ice",
    ". moreover , @xmath67 as compared to @xmath68 for a monolith of radius @xmath69 . at @xmath70 which corresponds to @xmath71 and @xmath72 ,",
    "the contact areas are comparable to the surface areas of individual elements so @xmath73 . with nominal parameters , @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    ".    a body with @xmath76 would avoid elastic failure if it were composed of identical spheres . for @xmath77",
    ", elastic failure would occur at points of contact among spheres .",
    "more generally , we would expect the voids in rubble piles to occupy a decreasing fraction of the volume with increasing @xmath10 up to @xmath78 . at @xmath79",
    ", the average interior pressure @xmath80 , so voids could only exist near the surface .",
    "rubble piles should be more common among smaller bodies because they cool more rapidly than larger ones and therefore are less likely to have been melted .",
    "thermal diffusivities of rock and ice are of order @xmath81 , which implies @xmath82 even bodies as small as @xmath66 might have been melted if they formed early and were endowed with short lived radioactive nuclides . on the other hand , bodies as large as @xmath83 which were fragmented by collisions after the short lived radioactive nuclides had decayed could have avoided melting .",
    "tides play crucial role in orbital and spin evolution of binaries . here",
    "we focus on the evolution after the secondary s spin has become synchronous with the mean orbital angular velocity while the primary s spin remains much faster . in this case",
    ", tides raised on the primary cause both the semimajor axis , @xmath25 , and the orbital eccentricity , @xmath84 , to grow while those raised on the secondary have negligible effect on the semimajor axis and cause the eccentricity to decay @xcite .",
    "relevant expressions for @xmath85 are : @xmath86 and @xmath87 for tides raised on the primary , and @xmath88 for tides raised on the secondary and @xmath89 denote primary and secondary .",
    "we adopt standard notations for tidal love number , @xmath90 , and quality factor , @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "@xmath92 is a stand - in for @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the tidal phase lag . ]",
    "tidal evolution rates depend on two parameters , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath90 for monoliths involves little uncertainty . for a body of uniform density",
    ", @xmath95 the estimation of @xmath91 is more uncertain .",
    "available evidence suggests that @xmath96 for monolithic bodies @xcite .",
    "semimajor axis evolution is driven by the transfer of angular momentum from the spin of the primary to the orbit .",
    "below , we estimate timescales for the semimajor axes of some well observed binary neas to have evolved from much smaller initial values to their current ones . integrating equation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath97 we compare timescales for models in which the bodies are assumed to be monolithic solids , fluids , and rubble piles .",
    "we set @xmath98 in each case .",
    "as the entries in table [ table ] demonstrate , the timescale for semimajor axis evolution is measured in gyrs for monoliths , years for fluids , and myrs for rubble piles .",
    "only the latter is consistent with estimates of @xmath99myr for the dynamical life time of neas @xcite . since it is plausible that the stress concentration in rubble piles results in @xmath100 , the ages we estimate for rubble piles should be viewed as upper limits .",
    ".[table ] ages of nea binaries based on assuming their semimajor axes have evolved from much smaller initial values [ eq . ] .",
    "comparison for monolithic ( @xmath101 ) , fluid ( @xmath102 ) , and rubble pile ( @xmath103 ) strength for primary .",
    "binary parameters from compilation by @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the effective rigidity of our model rubble pile , @xmath104 , is proportional to the square root of the confining pressure and independent of the size of the individual elements . laboratory measurements of the shear velocity , @xmath105 , in sand as a function of pressure provide a useful calibration .",
    "the data on @xmath106 plotted in figure 1 of @xcite are replotted in our figure 2 . on the figure s",
    "upper boundary we display the radius of an asteroid whose average internal pressure @xmath107 with @xmath108 corresponds to that given on the lower boundary .",
    "the range of pressures covered in the experiments on sand correspond to those inside asteroids with radii from 10 - 40@xmath109 .",
    "the right - hand boundary of the figure shows the effective rigidity corresponding to the shear velocity .",
    "it is well - fit by the solid line which is derived from our expression for effective rigidity with @xmath110 .",
    "this should not be taken as evidence that the yield stain of sand is @xmath111 since our formula is only accurate to order of magnitude .",
    "however , it does suggest that the ages we estimate in table [ table ] may be a factor of a few too large .",
    "the dashed line indicates the higher effective rigidity of a body composed of uniform quartz spheres .",
    "next we compare data on the rigidity of sand with that on the effective rigidity of neas .",
    "to do so , we assume that the semimajor axes of binary neas have evolved from much smaller initial values over @xmath112myr with a tidal @xmath98 .",
    "then we use equations , , and to evaluate the effective tidal rigidity of the primary for each of the binaries in table [ table ] .",
    "these rigidities are plotted as x s on figure [ fig : experiment ] .",
    "although the scatter is large , probably dominated by our assumption of a uniform age , the data fit nicely on the extrapolation to low pressure of the data from the experiments on sand .",
    "binary near - earth asteroids are thought to form by yorp spin up and/or tidal disruption and consequently be rubble piles @xcite .",
    "most have nearly circular orbits from which @xcite argue that tidal damping of their orbital eccentricities proceeds 3 to 4 orders of magnitude faster than would be expected for binary monoliths of comparable size .",
    "a significant fraction of this increase must be due to the reduced rigidity of a rubble pile as compared to a monolith since @xmath91 can not be smaller than unity .    for rocky bodies , scaling from the tidal love number of the moon , @xmath113 , @xmath114 which corresponds to @xmath115 .",
    "thus from equation with @xmath116 , we obtain @xmath117 since typical secondaries among near earth asteroid binaries have radii of a few tenths of a kilometer , much if not all of the increase in the inferred rates of eccentricity damping might be due to an increase of @xmath90 . however , it would not be surprising if a contribution came from a reduction of @xmath91 .",
    "we note that close encounters with earth or other planets might reset the eccentricities of binary neas on timescales comparable to those at which they evolve under tides .",
    "this issue deserves investigation .",
    "if both primary and secondary were strength rather than gravity dominated ( @xmath118 ) , then the ratio of the rates of eccentricity excitation and damping would be @xmath119 for monoliths of identical composition , this ratio reduces to @xmath120 thus for @xmath121,s , because the latter may also depend on strain , strain rate , temperature , and pressure . ]",
    "eccentricity damping would require @xmath122 corresponding to a mass ratio less than 3.20 . for primary and secondary composed of spherical elements with identical compositions and @xmath91 s",
    ", the ratio reads @xmath123 so eccentricity would damp for @xmath124 corresponding to a mass ratio below 33 . finally , for rubble piles composed of irregular elements of identical compositions and @xmath91 s , @xmath125 so eccentricity would damp for all mass ratios .",
    "it is clear that eccentricity damping is more likely for binary rubble piles than for binary monoliths especially when the mass ratio is not large .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in the relative values of the primary s and secondary s @xmath0 and @xmath91 , eccentricity growth remains a possibility , in particular for large mass ratios .",
