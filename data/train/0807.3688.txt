    "over the past decades already much information on the nucleon s quark and anti - quark helicity distributions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , has been collected .",
    "the key processes exploited so far are inclusive and semi - inclusive deep - inelastic lepton nucleon scattering ( dis ) ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent experimental work ) .",
    "inclusive dis only measures the combinations @xmath2 , while semi - inclusive dis allows to separate the quark and anti - quark distributions , albeit with relatively large uncertainties associated with fragmentation .",
    "entirely independent and complementary information on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be obtained from the study of parity - violating single - spin asymmetries ( ssas ) in proton - proton scattering at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the main focus of the measurements of parity - violating spin asymmetries planned at rhic is on the production of @xmath3-bosons and their subsequent decay into a charged lepton and the corresponding unobserved ( anti-)neutrino .",
    "this process can lead to large longitudinal ssas , of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the process is `` clean '' in the sense that only the single generic subprocess @xmath5 contributes to lowest perturbative order ( lo ) , which in principle allows a direct study of a particular quark or anti - quark helicity distribution  @xcite .",
    "also , as the final state is generated by the electroweak interaction , qcd radiative corrections to the process are relatively simple to calculate and well understood  @xcite . on the other hand , the counting rates for lepton final states are low . in the present note , we discuss parity - violating ssas with a hadronic final state , such as a jet at large transverse momentum @xmath6 .",
    "this potentially provides an interesting alternative to the leptonic signal , foremost because jets are produced much more copiously than leptons .",
    "the idea to use parity - violating ssas to see hadronic @xmath3 decays  @xcite actually predates the discovery of the @xmath3s .",
    "the specific application to rhic with the aim of obtaining information on the spin - dependent quark and anti - quark distributions was discussed in  @xcite , where also the results for all the associated lo subprocess cross sections were presented .",
    "first - order qcd corrections were computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and turn out to be quite significant .",
    "apart from updating the expectations for the lo parity - violating ssa by using a more recent set of polarized parton distributions , we extend the theoretical status of higher - order qcd corrections by taking into account the resummation of large leading threshold logarithms to the cross sections .",
    "we also discuss the special case of jets that contain a charm quark .",
    "we find that in this case a much more favorable ssa is obtained than for the single - inclusive jet case .",
    "a non - vanishing longitudinal ssa in the process @xmath7 is parity - violating and can only arise through participation of the weak interactions .",
    "here we consider this reaction at the lowest order of perturbation theory .",
    "all the involved partonic cross sections for the process have been known for a long time  @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed the corresponding results .",
    "there are five different helicity structures for these cross sections , +    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     ignoring intrinsic charm in the nucleon , only two of the pure - qcd channels survive for charm production , namely @xmath8 and @xmath9 , leading to an enormously reduced unpolarized cross section in comparison to jet production . unfortunately , however , also the contribution of @xmath10 becomes much smaller .",
    "the only partonic subprocesses for this are @xmath11 , which are either ckm - suppressed or enter with the strange quark distribution .",
    "therefore , the main contributions to @xmath12 are of @xmath13 , as shown in fig .  [",
    "f : charm ] , similar to the lepton decay channel .",
    "nonetheless , one can see from the figure that the asymmetry @xmath14 integrated over the charm s pseudo - rapidity @xmath15 reaches up to about @xmath16 for @xmath17 , and up to @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "the pronounced peaks at both energies are generated by @xmath20-channel production of the weak gauge bosons , most notably the @xmath3 .",
    "the statistical errors of the asymmetry , which have been estimated under our earlier assumptions without including a charm detection efficiency , are reasonably small in the peak - region . in fig .",
    "[ f : charm_eta ] , @xmath14 is shown as a function of @xmath21 , for different values of @xmath6 .",
    "the effects can become of the order of @xmath22 , i.e. , as large as in the case of the production of a lepton pair .",
    "charm production probes in particular the large-@xmath23 @xmath24-quark distribution in the proton , and the @xmath25 distribution at moderately low @xmath23 .",
    "we have studied parity - violating single spin asymmetries in proton - proton scattering with hadronic final states for rhic kinematics . in general , measuring such parity - violating observables can provide new , complementary information on the quark helicity distributions of the nucleon .",
    "inclusive jets are produced copiously , but suffer from a very small spin asymmetry @xmath14 ( typically below @xmath26 ) .",
    "also , because of the many partonic channels that contribute to jets , the information on the polarized parton distributions from @xmath14 for jets is not as clear - cut as for the usually considered lepton final state . still , the jet @xmath14 should be accessible at rhic with the projected luminosity and might be a tool for an early detection of a parity - violating signal .",
    "we have estimated the role of qcd higher - order effects by implementing leading - logarithm threshold resummation and found that the cross sections are increased by resummation , but that the asymmetry is decreased further . for a charm final state ,",
    "rates are reduced , but the asymmetry can become much larger .",
