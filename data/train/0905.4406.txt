    "the development of _ ab initio _ theoretical descriptions of the low - energy dynamical behavior of quantum interacting models is naturally a very important issue in a huge variety of physical studies , ranging from statistical physics to quantum field theory . in the realm of condensed matter physics , this requires to start from the hamiltonian operator @xmath4 of a many - body system and to investigate dynamical properties via the study of _ spectral functions _ : @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 being given operators acting on the hilbert space of the system , and the brackets indicating expectation value on the ground state or thermal average . in this work",
    "we will address this topic in the case of bulk @xmath0he , which , during last decades , has gained extreme interest since it provides the simplest scenario in which quantum fluctuations and the statistics obeyed by the involved degrees of freedom govern the physics of a macroscopic sample , giving rise to a big deal of fascinating phenomena@xcite .",
    "the simple hamiltonian of the system displays all the complexities related to strong correlations among particles and has been a very important test - ground both for many body theories and for numerical simulations . in particular , the absence of the additional difficulties connected with fermi statistics has allowed quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods to provide _ exact _ descriptions of _ equilibrium _ phases of @xmath0he , opening the possibility of putting light into the intriguing physical mechanisms underlying superfluidity and bose einstein condensation on a quantitative basis@xcite .",
    "the natural idea of extending such approaches to _ dynamical properties _",
    "( excitation spectra , transport coefficients etc . ) is highly not trivial : a _ direct _ qmc computation of faces the problem of obtaining exact real time evolution , and general solutions are not known .",
    "nevertheless , we can try to partially fill this _ lack of knowledge _ using qmc techniques themselves . the stochastic processes related to imaginary time schroedinger equation",
    "underlying qmc simulations allow to perform _ observations _ on the system , resembling actual measurements on an experimental sample ; in particular in a qmc simulation it is straightforward to collect a set of _ observations _ : @xmath8 which are estimations of imaginary time correlation functions : @xmath9 in correspondence with a ( unavoidably ) finite number of imaginary time values @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the time step of the qmc algorithm employed . in general @xmath12",
    "is obtained as an average of several qmc calculations of @xmath1 , each affected by statistical noise and which are used to estimate the _ statistical uncertainties _ @xmath13 associated with @xmath12 .",
    "such observations can provide information to _ infer _ an estimation of @xmath2 , through the exact relation :    @xmath14    where for example , at zero temperature , @xmath15 , @xmath16 being the heaviside distribution .",
    "we have thus to face the _",
    "inverse problem_@xcite of _ deducing _ the spectral function @xmath2 , inverting starting from limited and noisy data . at a first glance ,",
    "one immediately convinces himself that such an inverse procedure in most realistic situations is unavoidably _ ill  posed _ , since any set of observations is limited and noisy and the situation is even worse since the kernel @xmath17 is a smoothing operator : the possibility of finding out one and only one @xmath2 _ solving our problem _ is excluded .",
    "often sum rules provide useful help , either imposing exact constraints on @xmath2 or allowing to perform additional qmc measurements : @xmath18 which provide estimations for some moments of @xmath2 : @xmath19 for example @xmath20 is an estimation of @xmath21 which may be easily obtained in equilibrium qmc simulations together with an associated statistical uncertainty .",
    "moreover some _ a priori knowledge _ may be assumed such as the support , non  negativity or some further properties .",
    "we would like to stress that the problem we have to face belongs to the huge class of the _ inverse problems _ , which , since the earliest days of research in physics , have always provided challenges in a huge variety of physical or even more generally scientific studies@xcite . at the most general level",
    ", an inverse problem emerges whenever one is building up a theoretical description of a natural phenomenon and ought to fill some _ lack _ of knowledge . typically one could need to infer some parameters of the theory , and this could be achieved borrowing information from experimental data or , as in our specific case , numerical _ observations _ , i.e. computer simulations .",
    "the task of facing the problem in equation , typically referred in literature as an _ analytic continuation _ problem , has already been investigated : the maximum entropy method@xcite ( mem ) is the most widely popular strategy developed ; in the realm of bulk quantum fluids it has provided only qualitatively interesting results@xcite .",
    "other methods have been proposed : the average spectrum method@xcite ( asm ) , which has been recently applied to lattice spin models@xcite but also to realistic off ",
    "lattice systems@xcite , the stochastic analytic continuation ( sac ) method@xcite and also the spectral analysis described in ref .. asm and sac are very similar approaches and it has been proposed that mem can be identified as a special limit of sac@xcite . along this way , very recently a new algorithm strictly based on principles of bayesian statistical inference has been proposed@xcite .",
    "all these new approaches have been found able to reaveal some fine details of the spectral functions but none of them has been applied to superfluid @xmath0he which is the case study of this work .",
    "we have used an inversion strategy which shares some features with the approaches cited above , but possesses also some peculiar features : a novel way to deal with the statistical uncertainties in the observations and the use of genetic algorithms to find spectral functions compatible with observations .",
    "a preliminary application of this strategy to the determination of the dynamical structure factor @xmath22 of liquid @xmath0he was presented in ref . ; here we explain it in detail and we present several applications to the helium system .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "in section ii we describe the strategy which we have used ; in section iii we show applications of this strategy on several helium systems ; section iv contains our conclusions .",
    "appendix a contains some details of the used strategy , while in appendix b we present tests on the reliability of this strategy on known spectral models .",
    "when considering ill - posed inverse problems some important questions naturally arise : what can we really learn when facing an inverse problem ?",
    "what do we mean when we speak about a _ solution _ ?",
    "in our opinion , a key proposition is brilliantly put forward in ref .",
    ", following popper@xcite : _ observations may be used only to falsify a theory_. translating this idea into the language of our problem , we can not expect to find out a recipe that will allow to _ deduce _ all what is needed to build up a unique function @xmath2 from a given set of observed _ data _ , maybe together with additional informations , @xmath23 .",
    "nevertheless , provided that we are able to construct a suitable parametrization of the abstract space @xmath24 containing all the possible spectral functions , we may use observations to provide a `` falsification test '' , aimed to exclude the functions @xmath2 which fail to fit the data @xmath23 via and . in this way",
    "we will be able to collect a ( maybe very big ) class of spectral functions , which have been not falsified by the measured data . in our opinion , the best way to achieve this is to fully exploit all the information related to the observations : that is , since any set of experimental data appears together with statistical uncertainties evaluated starting from suitable measurements , _ any _ set of data compatible with the original one has to take part to the falsification test , in order to suppress the possibility of unphysical effects arising from statistical fluctuations .",
    "once we remain with a set of equivalent spectral functions `` survived '' to the falsification test , depending on the mathematical details of the space @xmath24 , a natural idea appears to be that of devising a procedure allowing to capture what do the `` survived '' ones have in common . in this way , even if we wo nt succeed in finding out a unique @xmath25 , we will be able nevertheless to find out a class of features , providing physical properties , that @xmath26 has to possess not to be falsified by the limited set of observations . as explained below , to implement this",
    "we need a space of models @xmath24 , containing a wide collection of spectral functions consistent with any _ prior knowledge _ about @xmath2 , a falsification procedure relying on the qmc `` measurements '' @xmath27 and a strategy to capture the accessible physical properties of @xmath2 .",
    "the strategy we are going to describe in the following relies on genetic algorithms@xcite to explore @xmath24 and falsify its elements ; for this reason in the text we will refer to it as the genetic inversion via falsification of theories ( gift ) strategy .",
    "in our mathematical framework @xmath24 contains a wide class of step functions , providing a compromise between the possibility of suitably approximating _ any _ model of spectral function and the feasibility of numerical operations inside it . in the typical case ( @xmath28 )",
    "when @xmath2 is known to be real - valued , non - negative and the zero - moment sum - rule holds , we rely on models @xmath29 of the form : @xmath30 @xmath31 differs from the physical spectral functions by a factor @xmath20 , the zero  moment sum rule , which belongs to the set of observations and its role will become evident below .",
    "we introduce a discretization of the codomain :    @xmath32    to make the space finite , and we use the characteristic function @xmath33 of the intervals @xmath34 , @xmath35 being a partition of width @xmath36 of an interval of the real line larger than the hypothesized support of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath37 provides the maximum number of quanta of spectral weight available for the ensemble of the intervals @xmath38 .",
    "once we have defined the space of model spectral functions , we have to devise a practical strategy to implement the falsification principle .",
    "we have to rely on the qmc estimations @xmath27 . to keep the description simpler we now concentrate only on @xmath12 ; naturally all what we will say refers also to @xmath39 with obvious modifications .",
    "the numbers @xmath40 are averages evaluated during a simulation and appear together with their estimated statistical uncertainties @xmath13 . in typical approaches , such information are dealt with inside the framework of bayes theorem ; they provide the key ingredients to build up the _ a posteriori _",
    "probability@xcite to be maximized , together with some _ a priori _ probability , to extract the _ most probable _ spectral function .    on the other hand , we find natural to suggest a novel way of exploiting the information contained in @xmath13 : any set @xmath41 _ equivalent _ to , i.e. such that @xmath42 is of the same order as @xmath43",
    ", could be a result of another simulation . falsifying the elements of @xmath24",
    "should require not only compatibility with @xmath12 but also compatibility with a vast population of @xmath41 equivalent to the set of data . in general",
    ", relying on independent simulations to generate _ equivalent _ sets @xmath41 could represent a very demanding computational task ; thus , when this is not sistematically practicable , we need a recipe to generate _ equivalent _ sets @xmath41 , and then we have to use the generated @xmath41 to falsify the elements of @xmath24 . at the simplest level",
    "we have addressed the generation of the sets @xmath41 by sampling independent gaussian distributions centered on the original observations , with variances corresponding to the estimated statistical uncertainties . a generic element",
    "@xmath41 is then : @xmath44 being @xmath45 random numbers sampled from gaussian distributions with zero mean and variances equal to @xmath46 .",
    "see the end of appendix a to read about possible extensions related to this point .",
    "when the procedure in has been used , a posteriori , in some selected cases , one can check the accuracy of the results obtained by comparing these with models coming from the analysis of independent qmc observations .",
    "we stress that the very idea of exploiting the statistical uncertainties in the observations for generating _ equivalent _ sets @xmath41 is the main difference with respect to preexisting statistical approaches to inverse problems .",
    "the key point is then to falsify the elements of @xmath24 relying on each one of these sets : compatibility means small deviations from the observations .",
    "thus , given the set @xmath41 , a very simple measure of the compatibility of a model with this set of observations can be obtained by computing @xmath47 ^ 2 \\quad .",
    "\\label{deviation}\\ ] ] the normalization of our models requires the multiplication of @xmath31 by the estimation , @xmath20 , of the zero moment , which belongs to the set of observations @xmath48 ; consistently , we sample also its value analogously to how we treat @xmath12 .",
    "this is the reason why a factor @xmath49 appears in .",
    "each member @xmath41 of equivalent data leads to a different model ; let us call @xmath50 the model found with the @xmath51-th member @xmath41 .",
    "each one of these models can not be trusted to be the solution of the inverse problem , being at least partially biased by the particular @xmath41 ; in other terms we can say that each one of these models will posses spurious information , presumably different in each model , together with some physical information .",
    "an averaging procedure is therefore the simplest way to filter out the spurious information and to reveal physical information , which consist in the common features among the models which have not been falsified : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of equivalent random set of @xmath41 used in the computation and @xmath54 is the @xmath49 used in the @xmath51-th reconstruction .",
    "we stress again that the averaging procedure in does not represent the absence of a sensible strategy for the choice among the generated @xmath50 ; in fact , as explained in ref . , the whole collection of the not falsified models should be considered .",
    "contrarily , we have a sensible strategy : we must not make any choice , all the models that have not been falsified are equivalent ; as a consequence we are interested only in their common features , an information that we extract via the averaging procedure in .    the average procedure in the definition of @xmath55 points toward some similarities between our strategy and that of asm or sac and also that of ref .. however , in the light of the falsification principle , these approaches are fairly different : in order to obtain their `` solution '' , asm and sac average over spectral functions obtained by exploring model - space regions via a local metropolis random walk based on a probability distribution;@xcite in these approaches the statistical uncertainties in the observations play a different role , appearing only in the definition of the probability ( asm and sac ) or in the definition of the _ minimal deviation _ in ref .. another issue is the algorithm used to explore the space of models ; as explained below , gift uses a _",
    "non - local _ dynamics induced by a stochastic evolutionary process instead of a local metropolis random walk which , in principle , could suffer from ergodicity problems , being the high probability model - space regions not guaranteed to be connected .    at this point",
    "the following question urges an answer : how can we practically explore @xmath24 ?",
    "we have implemented genetic algorithms as efficient algorithms to explore our huge space of models , @xmath24",
    ". there could be inverse problems and different space of models which could be more efficiently explored with other algorithms ; obviously , the `` inversion via falsification of theories '' approach , which consists mainly in the novel treatment of the statistical uncertainties of observations , can be applied also using a `` dynamics '' in the space of models different from the genetic one .",
    "genetic algorithms ( ga ) provide an extremely efficient tool to explore a sample space by a _",
    "non - local _ stochastic dynamics , via a survival  to  fitness evolutionary process mimicking the natural selection we observe in natural world ; such evolution aims toward `` good '' _ building blocks_@xcite which , in our case , should recover information on physical spectral functions . the fitness of one particular @xmath31 should be based on the observations , i.e. , on the noisy measured set @xmath27 .",
    "but as explained before , taking into account the estimated statistical noise of @xmath48 , any set @xmath56 compatible with @xmath48 provides equivalent information to build a fitness function .",
    "thus in our ga any random set @xmath57@xcite gives rise to a fitness , which simply compares `` predictions '' of theories and `` observations '' : @xmath58 ^ 2 \\label{fitness}\\ ] ] in the free parameters @xmath59 are adjusted in order to make the contributions to @xmath60 coming from @xmath41 and from @xmath61 of the same order of magnitude : the idea is that we are not allowed to prefer some particular observation among the others , thus they should have the same weight in the fitness . if it happens that one moment is exactly known , no error is added making @xmath62 .",
    "we stress that provides the simplest and the most natural definition ; moreover , as explained below , our ga uses @xmath60 only to order models in ascending fitness , thus any alternative definition of @xmath60 which provides the same ordering will give rise to an identical genetic dynamics .",
    "ga are well know procedures characterized by well defined ( genetic  like ) operations on populations of candidate solution to optimization problems in applied mathematics . for basic nomenclature and standard implementations",
    "one can refer to textbooks ( e.g. see ref . ) . in appendix",
    "a we present our particular realization related to the space of models we have defined . in our ga , we start randomly constructing a collection of @xmath31 ; each @xmath31 is coded by @xmath63 integers , @xmath64 in equation . the genetic dynamics then consists in a succession of _ generations _ during which an initial _ population _ , consisting of @xmath65 _ individuals _ , is replaced with new ones in order to reach regions of @xmath24 where high values of the _ fitness _ exist , for a given @xmath56 . in practice , in the passage between two generations a succession of `` biological  like '' processes",
    "takes place , and namely _ selection _ , _ crossover _ and _ mutation_. the _ selection _ procedure is meant to choose preferentially individuals with large fitness in the process of producing the next generation ( see appendix a for more details ) .    in our context",
    "the ga dynamics performs the falsification procedure : only the @xmath31 with the highest fitness in the last generation provides a model , @xmath66 , which has not been falsified by @xmath56 .",
    "the maximum amount of generations , @xmath67 , is chosen in order to reach the condition @xmath68 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "many independent evolutionary processes are generated by sampling different @xmath56 , thus obtaining a set made of the elements @xmath69 ; at this point , as explained above , the averaging procedure extracts the common features in this set and this produces the gift estimate of the spectral function .",
    "we are ready now to present applications of our approach on physical systems .",
