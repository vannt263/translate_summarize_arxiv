    "the presence of point - like , non - nuclear and extremely luminous x - ray sources in local galaxies has been recognised for some time @xcite .",
    "these ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulx ) can have luminosities @xmath0ergs s@xmath1 , and their true nature is yet to be understood .",
    "this luminosity greatly exceeds the eddington luminosity @xmath2 of a 10 m@xmath3 black hole ( bh ) if the emission is isotropic . this has led to the suggestion that the accreting object could be an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) with mass @xmath4 m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if so , these objects are a link between the established population of stellar mass black holes , and the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei .",
    "the presence of cool x - ray spectral components , and the timescales of rapid variability in some systems ( e.g. ngc 4559 x-7 , @xcite ) is consistent with the imbh scenario .",
    "however , the existence of imbh is still under debate , as some observations appear contradictory .",
    "for example , some systems require high accretion disk temperatures in model fits to the x - ray data @xcite .",
    "it has also been noted that the emission is not likely to be isotropic , but collimated after to a greater or lesser extent @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has also been argued by @xcite that an accretion disk dominated by radiation pressure would exhibit strong density inhomogeneities on scales much smaller than the disk scale height , so that an inhomogeneous accretion disk could permit escaping flux to exceed @xmath2 by a factor of up to @xmath5 .",
    "it seems increasingly likely that the ulx population is heterogeneous , with evidence to support beaming with stellar mass bhs in some cases and imbh in others @xcite .",
    "the qpo reported by @xcite is incompatible with the beaming hypothesis , for example , as is the association of some ulxs with diffuse h@xmath6 nebulae , suggesting isotropic illumination of the interstellar medium by the ulx @xcite . in this paper",
    "we assume an imbh interpretation for ulx .",
    "furthermore , we seek to describe the very brightest objects in the ulx population  specifically , those that have luminosities of @xmath7ergs s@xmath1  or greater ( e.g. in m82 , @xcite ) .",
    "we find that wind accretion from a companion star is insufficient to supply the accretion rate required for this luminosity .",
    "we therefore assume the bh accretes via roche lobe overflow from a necessarily massive or giant companion .",
    "the imbh interpretion depends on the x - ray emission from the disk in the immediate environment of the ulx , which is model dependent .",
    "moreover , the physics at these high accretion rates near the event horizon is far from understood .",
    "we therefore seek an alternative channel to x - rays by which the nature of the ulx can be explored , using optical / infrared ( optical / ir ) properties .",
    "we argue that these properties will be strongly influenced by the proximity of such an intense x - ray radiation field , and this can be used as a diagnostic .",
    "if the ulx is in a binary system , the x - ray emission will modify the optical / ir characteristics of the companion star and accretion disk .",
    "in particular , this will induce intensity and colour shifts compared to normal stars , and these will vary at orbital periods .",
    "these both identify the true optical counterpart and also provide relatively direct indications of the masses of the components .",
    "x - ray irradiation can drive evolution in xrb @xcite , and cause significant colour and magnitude changes of the optical counterpart .",
    "this has been observed in the sub - eddington regime .",
    "one example is the her x-1 system , an x - ray binary consisting of a neutron star accreting matter from a non - degenerate stellar companion .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is a third of the eddington luminosity @xcite , and the binary period is @xmath8 days .",
    "the neutron star accretes matter via roche lobe overflow through an accretion disk @xcite , and so is a good analogy to the ulx systems described in this paper .",
    "the star has been observed to change spectral type from a to b over the binary period .",
    "@xcite observed a b magnitude amplitude of @xmath9 mag and interpreted this variation as a result of x - ray heating of a late a - type star .",
    "other authors interpret the variation in terms of heating of the star and a tilted , precessing accretion disk @xcite .",
    "we consider a binary model for ulx to investigate the radiation effects .",
    "we calculate the optical / ir observables from the companion star and accretion disk and discuss the implications of the results .",
    "we apply the results to the ngc 4559 candidates to either eliminate them as possibilities or constrain the parameters of any binary system of which they may be part .",
    "we also predict the ir properties for future observations .",
    "we describe our model in section [ sec : model ] , and examine the results of this model in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec:4559 ]",
    "we compare the model to observations of ulx x-7 in ngc 4559 .",
    "the accretion rate required by the brightest ulxs exceeds that which could be supplied by a stellar wind .",
    "we therefore assume the matter is transferred onto the compact object through roche lobe overflow .",
    "we will use this assumption to constrain the geometry of the system .",
    "we assume that the system is in a quasi - steady state , and the irradiated surfaces are in thermal , radiative , and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this requires that the irradiated layers necessarily re - emit all of the radiation falling on them .",
    "we consider the effects of radiative transport and radiative equilibrium in the irradiated surface under x - ray illumination .",
    "we consider a plane - parallel model and adopt the radiative transport formulation of @xcite and @xcite to describe the heated stellar surface and accretion disk .",
    "we detail this formulation in appendix [ sec : ppmodel ] .",
    "the heating of any point on the stellar surface is described by the equations in appendix [ sec : ppmodel ] .",
    "we calculated the total heating by dividing the surface of the star into discrete cells and calculating the magnitude of the effect for each cell .",
    "the roche surface for a given mass ratio was calculated over a grid of cells .",
    "each cell has a flat surface , the size of which is dependent on the distance to neighbouring points .",
    "the angles @xmath6 and @xmath10 ( required components of the heating equations ) can be calculated through appeal to the angle between the normal vector to the surface at the point in question , and the vector incident on the point originating at the bh ( @xmath6 ) or the observer ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the irradiation temperature is calculated at this point , and taken to be the temperature over the entire surface of the cell .",
    "the shape of the roche lobe is determined solely by the mass ratio @xmath11 , so the angles and relative positions of the points are independent of the scale of the system .",
    "the system can therefore be easily scaled appropriately to calculate the heating , according to the binary separation @xmath12 .",
    "this in turn is directly inferred from the binary period when the mass ratio is known .",
    "if the system is semi - detached then the size of the star itself is also determined by the scale of the system .",
    "we calculate the luminosity of the star by summing the emergent radiation in the direction of the observer for each cell .",
    "this includes a component as a result of irradiation , as well as the original stellar luminosity , which includes both limb darkening and gravity darkening @xcite effects .",
    "we also include the emission from an irradiated accretion disk as an additional optical source .",
    "we have considered two models .",
    "the first follows @xcite to describe this disk .",
    "there , the irradiation temperature @xmath13 varies as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the accretion rate and @xmath16 is the distance from the accreting source .    for accreting black holes , @xmath17 where the efficiency parameter @xmath18 . if we take an x - ray albedo of @xmath19 and assume that @xmath20 , then the value of @xmath21 in equation [ eqn : dubtemp ] would be @xmath22 , with the geometry of a thin disk @xcite . here",
    "and hereafter we use equation [ eqn : accrate ] with @xmath20 to determine the value of @xmath15 from @xmath23 .    using the fact that the radiation - transfer equations are linear",
    ", we can use the principle of superposition to calculate the disk temperature from the combination of the irradiative heating and the viscous heating in the disk in the absence of x - ray irradiation .",
    "we calculate the temperature as a function of disk radius , and then sum the flux from a series of blackbody annuli to describe the overall disk flux .",
    "we take the inner disk radius to be the last stable circular orbit around the bh we are describing .",
    "we take the outer disk radius to be the ` tidal truncation radius ' , beyond which keplerian orbits intersect .",
    "this is weakly dependent on the mass ratio @xcite but is generally taken to be between @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the roche lobe radius .",
    "we consider it sufficient in our model to fix the outer disk radius to be @xmath24 of the roche lobe radius .",
    "the alternative description of the accretion disk directly applies the radiative transfer formulation of @xcite that we have modified for for the star ( see appendix [ sec : ppmodel ] ) .",
    "we consider a thin disk and determine a radial temperature profile in absence of irradiation using the @xcite prescription .",
    "we assume the local flare angle is given by @xmath26 @xcite , where @xmath27 is the disk scale height .",
    "we calculate the luminosity of the disk in a manner identical to that of the star .",
    "we divide the disk surface into cells and calculate the heating effect on each as determined by the incident flux and the angle of incidence @xmath6 .",
    "we sum the emergent radiation from each cell in the direction of the observer in order to calculate the disk luminosity",
    ".    we will refer to both disk models throughout this paper .",
    "the prescription of @xcite will be referred to as the first model , and the radiative transfer formulation will be referred to as the second .",
    ".the set of parameters used in sections [ sec : results ] and [ sec:4559 ] to describe stars of different spectral type and luminosity class .",
    "values are taken from @xcite [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this section we examine the dependence of our model on various parameters . table [ tab : stars ] contains masses , radii and luminosities for some early - type main sequence ( ms ) stars and some supergiants .",
    "we use these stellar parameters in our model .",
    "we keep the primary ( bh ) mass as an input parameter , and we constrain the scale of the roche lobes by setting the volume radius of the secondary lobe equal to the radius of the star in table [ tab : stars ] , hence fulfilling the condition for roche lobe overflow .",
    "we take the x - ray luminosity of the bh to be a constant @xmath7ergs s@xmath1  emitted isotropically .",
    "the soft x - rays are easily absorbed at the disk surface , whereas the hard x - rays are less easily absorbed but are scattered .",
    "they penetrate the star to greater optical depths until the photons are down scattered to lower energies . in our model , we parametrise the absorption coefficients for the hard and soft x - rays by means of two parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 and denote the hard and soft components of the x - ray flux as @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "we also define a hardness - ratio parameter @xmath32 .",
    "we choose values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the two parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively throughout and allow the band boundary of the hard and soft x - ray bands as parameters to be determined . for an input spectrum consisting of a blackbody and a power law component",
    ", we find the boundary of the soft and hard band to be @xmath9kev .",
    "we set the gravity darkening parameter @xmath35 to be @xmath36 , representing a star with a purely radiative outer envelope .                    in figure",
    "[ fig : intmap_ms ] we show the intensity variation over the surface of an o5v star and disk when we take the bh mass to be @xmath37@xmath38 . in figure",
    "[ fig : intmap_sg ] we use the same bh mass with a g0i star .",
    "we use the quantity @xmath39 as a measure of intensity ( equation [ eqn : btau ] ) , setting @xmath40 to @xmath41 , and we show projections of the star and disk in the orbital plane .",
    "the stellar maps show both the irradiative and darkening effects .",
    "we use the dubus prescription of section [ sec : diskmodel ] to describe the disk .",
    "we see that the combined surface intensity is significantly higher than would be expected for an unirradiated star .",
    "there is however a noticeable difference between the two figures .",
    "the stellar intensity of the g0i star increases in the direction of the l1 point , reaching a peak there . on the other hand , in the o5v figure",
    "the darkening effects dominate at the l1 point , so that the intensity at that point is less than the surrounding surface . here",
    "we are using a low hardness ratio of @xmath42 , and so little flux penetrates to an optical depth of @xmath43 .",
    "we find that if we increase the hardness ratio the intensity distribution becomes similar to that of the g0i star . as the bh mass increases , the separation increases , the irradiating flux decreases and the intensity distribution over the surface of both stars tends towards that shown in figure [ fig : intmap_ms](b ) .",
    "note that we have not included here any shadowing of the accretion disk on the stellar surface , which should magnify any darkening at the l1 point .            in figure",
    "[ fig : models](a ) we illustrate the change in effective luminosity of an o5v star .",
    "we show the @xmath44 band absolute magnitude against the bh mass for an unirradiated star and three different sets of irradiated star calculations . as well as our model described above",
    ", we shows the results from an extension to our model where we have included the effect of a disk which is completely opaque to the radiation incident on it and is hence shadowed on the stellar surface .",
    "we also show the effects of in addition taking into account the irradiation pressure on the star  we will discuss this in section [ sec : radp ] . the disk height at the outer disk radius @xmath45 is taken to be @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this shielding effect results in a reduced stellar magnitude . in this figure",
    "we have set the phase angle to be zero ( so the star is in superior conjunction ) and set the inclination of the system such that @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ fig : models](a ) shows that the heating effect on the star decreases with increasing bh mass , which may be counter - intuitive . this relationship is a consequence of constraining the volume radius of the secondary roche lobe to the radius of the undistorted star . as the mass ratio decreases",
    ", the roche lobe geometry requires the binary separation @xmath12 to increase .",
    "the result is a decrease in the amount of flux incident on the stellar surface .",
    "figure [ fig : models](b ) is a sample lightcurve for the o5v star .",
    "here we use a bh mass of @xmath48@xmath38  and an inclination such that @xmath47 .",
    "this figure shows both the ellipsoidal variation of an unirradiated star , as well as the combination of both ellipsoidal and irradiative effects .",
    "we include a third line showing the magnitude when the irradiated accretion disk is included .",
    "we will discuss the effect of the disk on the lightcurve in section [ sec : diskresults ] .",
    "we now consider the effect of the x - ray irradiation on the geometrical shape of the secondary .",
    "we apply the prescription of @xcite , which involves a modification of the roche potential in which the radiation pressure force is parameterised using the ratio of the radiation to the gravitational force .",
    "equation 6 of @xcite shows how we can combine the gravitational and radiation pressure forces from the bh as a reduced gravitational force equal to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the gravitational force .",
    "@xmath51 is the product of a parameter dependent on the x - ray luminosity and binary mass ratio ( calculated using equation 25 of @xcite ) and the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the direction of the flux vector .    after calculating the position of each cell on the roche surface in our usual way",
    ", we calculate a @xmath51 value for each cell , replace the gravitational force in the roche potential with the reduced gravitational force and recalculate the position of each cell .",
    "this needs to be repeated for a number of iterations in order to find the solution since the surface normal for each cell changes for each calculation .",
    "when the surface has been determined we calculate the heating at each point in our normal way .",
    "we take the accretion disk to be opaque to the radiation , so the inner lagrangian point is shadowed and therefore the radiation pressure will not cause the star to become detached from this point .",
    "the greater the flux incident on the stellar surface , the greater the pressure effect .",
    "we therefore see the most significant distortion when the binary separation is at its lowest , which occurs when we use a ms star and a low bh mass .",
    "we illustrate this effect in figure [ fig : intmap_rp ] , in which we use a @xmath52@xmath38  bh and an o5v star .",
    "we show the @xmath44 magnitude dependence on increasing bh mass in figure [ fig : models](a ) .",
    "note that we plot values only for bh masses of @xmath48  @xmath53@xmath38 .",
    "this is because we observe that for a bh mass of less than @xmath48@xmath38  the flux incident on the surface is extremely high and the @xcite formulation becomes inappropriate to describe the stellar shape , since the formulation does not allow for any surface motion . in reality",
    "the external irradiation will drive circulatory currents in the stellar surface .",
    "a full treatment will require hydrodynamical motions to be considered .",
    "with @xmath43 for an irradiated o5v star with a bh mass of 150@xmath38  and with disk shadowing .",
    "we include the formulation of @xcite in order to show the effect of irradiation pressure on the star .",
    "the solid outline shows the stellar shape when we neglect this effect .",
    "we plot a projection perpendicular to the orbital plane with the labelled distances in units of @xmath54.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      we now investigate further the additional flux from the accretion disk .",
    "an increased bh mass leads to a larger binary separation and thus to a corresponding increase in the size of the accretion disk , since the outer disk radius is constrained by the roche lobe size through tidal effects .",
    "the net result is that the disk total luminosity increases with bh mass , and hence compensates for the decreasing stellar total luminosity .",
    "we find that the luminosity class of the irradiated star is the most important factor in determining which component dominates . to illustrate this we show in figure [ fig : massmags ] the absolute magnitude dependence on bh mass for a o5v and a g0i star , along with the corresponding disk magnitudes .",
    "we use the @xcite disk prescription for figure [ fig : massmags](a , b ) , and the @xcite disk model for figure [ fig : massmags](c , d ) .",
    "we find the magnitude of this second disk model is strongly dependent on the hardness parameter @xmath55 .",
    "a low value of @xmath42 produces a disk almost identical to the dubus disk in terms of magnitude and colour .",
    "we use a value of @xmath56 in ( c ) and ( d ) to illustrate the effect of a harder x - ray spectrum . in figure",
    "[ fig : chiplots ] we further illustrate the effect of varying disk hardness on the disk magnitude for different combinations of star and bh .",
    "if we examine the stellar luminosity change as a function of bh mass in figure [ fig : massmags ] first , we note that while the bh + ms star changes by a few tenths of a magnitude over the bh mass range , the bh + supergiant decreases by two magnitudes over that same range .",
    "the supergiant has a much larger radius , and so for a low binary separation the flux incident on the stellar surface will be high .",
    "however , when the mass ratio is decreased , this larger radius leads to a correspondingly larger binary separation than we see in the ms systems .    if we now examine the disk intensity dependence on bh mass , we find the reverse is true .",
    "if the donor is a ms star , the dubus disk ( a ) increases in @xmath44 magnitude by more than 2.5 magnitudes over the mass range .",
    "when we use harder x - ray radiation ( c ) the result is a more luminous disk , with approximately the same increase in magnitude over the mass range .",
    "in contrast , the dubus disk accompanying the supergiant ( b ) increases in @xmath44 magnitude by less than a magnitude over the mass range ( the exact increase depends on the method we use to determine @xmath45 ) . the disk irradiated by the harder x - rays ( d ) increases by about 1.5 magnitudes . these can be explained by the fact that the large supergiant leads to a large roche lobe for all bh masses .",
    "hence even a low bh mass results in a very bright disk , and since the temperature of the disk decreases with increasing disk radius , the effect of making a large disk larger still has a smaller effect in terms of total disk luminosity . in constrast , when the companion star is on the main sequence , the smaller size of the system at low bh masses results in a small and faint disk .",
    "when the bh mass is increased and the disk grows , the effect on its magnitude is much more significant .",
    "we also show on figure [ fig : massmags ] the @xmath44 magnitude dependence on bh mass of the disk and star combined .",
    "it is interesting to note that were we actually observing an o5v system , it would be much easier to constrain the bh mass with the disk component included .",
    "the same can not be said for the system with the g0 supergiant .",
    "the gradient of the luminosity change with increasing bh mass is still dictated by the decreasing stellar luminosity , but the curve is rendered shallower by the disk component .",
    "we now investigate the effect of the accretion disk on the amplitude of the lightcurve .",
    "we include a line in figure [ fig : models](b ) showing the magnitude when the irradiated accretion disk is included . in our thin disk approximation",
    "the contribution of the disk will be constant for any phase , so the shape of the lightcurve will not be affected .",
    "the exception to this will be when the inclination is such that the disk is partially or fully eclipsed by the star .",
    "the relative amplitude of the lightcurve will be affected , depending on the luminosity of the disk . in figure",
    "[ fig : models](b ) for example , the amplitude decreases from @xmath57 v magnitudes to @xmath58 . for any given star the magnitude of the disk will increase with bh mass , and",
    "so the lightcurve relative amplitude will decrease .",
    "the lightcurve of the star alone will decrease in amplitude with increasing bh mass due to the decrease in x - ray flux incident on the star ",
    "the addition of the disk will reinforce this .",
    "we found that the amplitude of the lightcurve for a g0i star with @xmath59ergs s@xmath1 , @xmath60 and @xmath42 drops from @xmath61 mag to @xmath62 mag as we increase the bh mass from @xmath37 to @xmath53@xmath38 .",
    "an o5v star under the same set of conditions produces a lightcurve with an amplitude of @xmath63 mag for a bh mass of @xmath37@xmath38 .",
    "this drops below @xmath64 mag as the mass is increased to @xmath48@xmath38  as shown in figure [ fig : models](b ) , and at a mass of @xmath53@xmath38  the lightcurve is dominated by the ellipsoidal variation and has an amplitude of @xmath65 mag .",
    "figure [ fig : chiplots ] shows the disk magnitude for a hardness ratio over the range of @xmath66  @xmath67 using the @xcite formulation .",
    "we show the magnitude for a combination of a @xmath37 , @xmath48 and @xmath53@xmath38  bh with a o5v ( a ) and a g0i ( b ) star .",
    "the change in disk luminosity over this hardness range is large , demonstrating the importance of this factor .    to summarise this section ,",
    "we find that the stellar luminosity component is at its greatest for low bh masses and the disk component is at its greatest for high bh masses . if we consider separately a ms star , a supergiant star , a disk in a bh / ms system and a disk in a bh / supergiant system , we find the biggest changes in magnitude over the bh mass range occur for a supergiant star or a bh / ms disk . in general then ,",
    "while the emission will always consist of a disk and a star component , the stellar component will dominate for a ms star / low mass bh combination , and the disk component will dominate in the case of a supergiant / high mass bh .",
    "this assumes the x - ray radiation is soft  when the hardness of the x - rays is increased , the contribution of the disk component will increase for all bh masses , and in the supergiant systems in particular we begin to see domination by the disk component over the entire mass range .",
    "we now use our model to examine the change in the parameters of a ulx system by making predictions at other wavelengths , extending into the infrared .",

    "we take the inclination to be @xmath82 in figure [ fig:4559](a ) and @xmath60 in figure [ fig:4559](b , c ) . as before we use two disk models ",
    "the first of which describes both the prescription of section [ sec : diskmodel ] and the model of section [ sec : wudiskmodel ] when @xmath42 .",
    "the second disk model uses the formulation of section [ sec : wudiskmodel ] but with @xmath56 , giving a brighter disk .",
    "we have again taken the phase angle of the binary to be such that the star is at superior conjunction .",
    "we have examined other phase angles but we find that this does not affect the general results described in this section .",
    "we also find that the effect of including radiation pressure for bh masses of @xmath48 ",
    "@xmath53@xmath38  is small .",
    "we incorporate shadowing of the star by the disk into our stellar irradiation model .",
    "we first examine figure [ fig:4559](a ) .",
    "this describes the case where @xmath82 , so we see no accretion disk component . examining the lines for the table [ tab : stars ] stars , we see a clear distinction between the supergiants and the ms stars .",
    "the ms stars occupy the left hand side of the plot only , and show much less change in colour and magnitude over the bh mass range .",
    "if we now look at the observed stars , we can see most of the candidate stars seem to fit into one of the two regimes .",
    "it is possible that either star 5 or 8 could be an irradiated ms star .",
    "stars 2 , 3 and 4 could all be irradiated supergiants ( albeit for a very large bh mass ) .",
    "star 1 could be an irradiated supergiant , or an irradiate , evolved ms star ( track 1 ) .",
    "the picture changes significantly when we consider the case where @xmath60 . as well as the irradiated star",
    ", there is a disk component present .",
    "we look first at the fainter disk as described in figure [ fig:4559](b ) . as in figure",
    "[ fig : massmags ] , we see that the inclusion of the disk results in an increase in @xmath44 magnitude with increasing bh mass .",
    "stars 1 , 5 and 8 can still be described by our models .. however , the addition of the disk flux has a large effect on the magnitude of the supergiant and high - mass bh systems .",
    "the large luminosity decrease with increasing bh mass is curtailed , and the observations of stars 2 , 3 and 4 are too faint for supergiants to be candidates .",
    "we additionally examined the case where @xmath83 , and found the difference between this and the @xmath60 case to be minor .",
    "again , stars 1 , 5 and 8 fit with predictions of a star and disk . stars 2 , 3 and 4 are too faint to fit with the predictions of the model .",
    "we now consider the brighter disk caused by increasing @xmath55 by an order of magnitude , as described in figure [ fig:4559](c ) .",
    "this disk completely dominates the optical emission  the only role the star plays is to constrain the disk brightness by determining the roche lobe geometry .",
    "we draw the same conclusions from these plots as we did from figure [ fig:4559](b )  stars 1 , 5 and 8 fit within the predictions of these star and disk combinations .",
    "stars 2 , 3 and 4 do not .",
    "we find therefore that the observed colours of stars 2 , 3 and 4 are marginally consistent with irradiated red supergiants when we assume a large bh mass and set @xmath82 . in this case",
    "there will be temporal variations which will act as the candidate signature .",
    "when we move to lower inclinations the increased flux from the accretion disk in our models indicates that the optical counterpart can not be a red star ( redder than @xmath84 ) , and so we suggest that star 1 , 5 or 8 is more likely to be the counterpart . in this case , the optical observations are unable to discriminate between different bh masses .",
    "we note that @xcite suggested without taking the effects of a disk or irradiated companion into account that star 1 is the most likely candidate for the optical counterpart of x-7 in ngc 4559 . in addition , taking the results of section [ sec : ir ] into account , we note that the irradiated system could be very bright in the ir",
    ". observations at these wavelengths could be useful in determining the counterpart .",
    "we have constructed a model describing the heating effect of a ulx on a roche lobe filling companion star .",
    "we plan to apply this model to the problem of positively identifying ulx optical counterparts , and then use observations of that counterpart to constrain the bh mass and the nature of the companion .",
    "our model uses a radiative transfer formulation to account for the x - ray nature of the incident radiation and the distribution of the re - radiated emission .",
    "we incorporate the distorted roche lobe filling geometry of the star and account for the limb and gravity darkening effects .",
    "we also include the additional luminosity from an irradiated accretion disk , for two different disk models .",
    "we have illustrated how our model can be applied in a number of different ways .",
    "first , we assume that the donor star is filling its roche lobe , as suggested by the high x - ray luminosity .",
    "we have then shown that for a given spectral type , the effects of irradiation decrease as the mass of the black hole in the system ( and hence binary separation ) is increased .",
    "measurement of the amplitude and period of the lightcurve of a counterpart will allow us to determine many of the free parameters of the system  we have shown how our model incorporates both the ellipsoidal and irradiative effects and that we can separate out these components .",
    "we have discussed how the accretion disk can be the dominant component in some systems and have shown that measurement of the periodicity of the binary can distinguish between these regimes .",
    "we have shown how the importance of the disk is linked with the luminosity class of the companion star , and predict that observations at infrared wavelengths makes it easier to distinguish between different systems without the need for temporal observations .",
    "finally , we have applied our model to a set of observations of potential candidates for the counterpart of ulx x-7 in ngc 4559 . while the available data is not sufficient to draw any firm conclusions",
    ", we see that if the observations contain any appreciable accretion disk component then only three of the possible candidates fit our model .",
    "these candidates imply the donor star is an early - type ms star .",
    "supergiant companions are only possible for a high inclination and a bh mass of @xmath85@xmath38 .",
