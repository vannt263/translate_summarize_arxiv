    "turbulence with a large - scale velocity shear is a universal feature in astrophysical plasmas .",
    "it has been recently recognized that in a sheared turbulent plasma with high hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers a mean - field dynamo is possible even in a nonhelical and nonrotating homogeneous turbulence whereby a kinetic helicity and @xmath1 effect vanish ( see rogachevskii and kleeorin 2003 ; 2004 ; 2007 ; brandenburg 2005 ; brandenburg and subramanian 2005c ; rogachevskii et al . 2006a ; 2006b ) .",
    "the large - scale velocity shear produces anisotropy of turbulence with a nonzero background mean vorticity @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean velocity .",
    "the dynamo instability in a sheared turbulent plasma is related to the @xmath8-term in the mean electromotive force , and it can be written in the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the maximum scale of turbulent motions ( the integral turbulent scale ) and @xmath11 determines the inhomogeneity of the mean original magnetic field @xmath12 . in a sheared turbulent plasma the deformations of the original magnetic field lines are caused by the upward and downward turbulent eddies , and the inhomogeneity of the original mean magnetic field in the shear - current dynamo breaks a symmetry between the influence of upward and downward turbulent eddies on the mean magnetic field .",
    "this creates the mean electric current @xmath3 along the mean magnetic field and produces the mean - field dynamo due to the shear - current effect .",
    "the goal of this communication is to review recent studies on the new mechanism of generation of large - scale magnetic field due to the shear - current effect in a sheared turbulent plasma .",
    "the mean - field dynamo instability is saturated by the nonlinear effects .",
    "there are two types of the nonlinear effects caused by algebraic and dynamic nonlinearities .",
    "the effects of the mean magnetic field on the motion of fluid and on the cross - helicity result in quenching of the mean electromotive force which determines the algebraic nonlinearity .",
    "the dynamical nonlinearity in the mean - field dynamo is caused by the evolution of small - scale magnetic helicity , and it is of a great importance due to the conservation law for the magnetic helicity in turbulent plasma with very large magnetic reynolds numbers ( see , e.g. , kleeorin and rogachevskii 1999 ; brandenburg and subramanian 2005a ; rogachevskii et al .",
    "2006b , and references therein ) .",
    "the combined effect of the dynamic and algebraic nonlinearities saturates the growth of the mean magnetic field .",
    "the shear - current effect has been studied by rogachevskii and kleeorin ( 2003 ; 2004 ; 2007 ) for large hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers using two different approaches : the spectral @xmath13 approximation ( the third - order closure procedure ) and the stochastic calculus ( the path integral approach in a turbulence with a finite correlation time ) .",

    "let us consider a nonhelical and nonrotating homogeneous turbulent plasma with a weak mean velocity shear , @xmath14 and mean vorticity @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the velocity fluctuations .",
    "the mean magnetic field @xmath19 in the kinematic approximation is determined by the following equations @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the coefficient of turbulent magnetic diffusion and the dimensionless parameter @xmath23 determines the shear - current effect ( rogachevskii and kleeorin 2003 , 2004 ) . in eqs .",

    "the first term @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) determines the stretching of the magnetic field @xmath26 by the shear motions , which produces the field @xmath27 .",
    "the interaction of the non - uniform magnetic field @xmath27 with the background vorticity @xmath2 produces the electric current along the field @xmath27 .",
    "this implies generation the field component @xmath26 due to the shear - current effect , which is determined by the first term @xmath28 in eq .",

    "this effect results in the large - scale dynamo instability .",

    "the necessary condition for the dynamo instability is @xmath32 .",
    "the shear - current dynamo instability depends on the spatial scaling of the correlation time @xmath33 of the turbulent velocity field , where @xmath5 is the small - scale wave number .",
    "in particular , the shear - current dynamo in a non - convective turbulence occurs when the exponent @xmath34 . for the kolmogorov s type turbulent convection , the exponent @xmath35 and @xmath36 $ ] , where the convective contribution to the dynamo instability due to the shear - current effect depends on the parameter @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 is an imposed vertical heat flux which maintains the turbulent convection and @xmath39 is the acceleration of gravity . for a turbulent convection with a scale - independent correlation time , the exponent @xmath40 and the parameter @xmath23 is given by @xmath41 $ ] , where @xmath42 is the angle between the background mean vorticity @xmath2 and @xmath39 .",
    "note that the turbulent convection promotes the shear - current dynamo instability .",
    "in particular , the heat flux causes positive contribution to the shear - current effect when @xmath43 ( see rogachevskii and kleeorin , 2007 ) .    however , for small hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers , the turbulent correlation time is of the order of @xmath44 or @xmath45 depending on the magnetic prandtl number , i.e. , @xmath4 , where @xmath46 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath47 is the magnetic diffusion due to the electrical conductivity of the plasma . in this case @xmath48 , and the parameter @xmath49 even in a turbulent convection .",
    "this implies that for small hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers there is no dynamo action due to the shear - current effect .",
    "this result is in agreement with the recent studies by rdler and stepanov ( 2006 ) and rdiger and kitchatinov ( 2006 ) , where the dynamo action have not been found in non - helical and non - rotating sheared non - convective turbulent plasma in the framework of the second - order correlation approximation ( soca ) or the first - order smoothing approximation ( fosa ) .",
    "this approximation is valid only for small hydrodynamic reynolds numbers . even in a highly conductivity limit ( large magnetic reynolds numbers )",
    ", soca can be valid only for small strouhal numbers , while for large hydrodynamic reynolds numbers ( for a developed turbulence ) , the strouhal number is 1 .",
    "note that the standard approach ( i.e. , soca ) can not describe the situation in principle .",
    "the reason is that the shear - current dynamo requires a finite correlation time of turbulent velocity field , so the delta - correlated version of soca fails .",
    "the application of the path integral approach for the study of the shear - current dynamo requires a finite correlation time of turbulent velocity field .",
    "the shear - current dynamo is a phenomenon that results from the interaction of the energy - containing - scale of turbulence with large - scale shear , and the constraint is that the hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers should be not small at least .",
    "therefore , the soca - based approaches do not work properly to describe the shear - current dynamo .",
    "probably , the hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers can be of the order of unity and there is no need for a developed inertial range in order to maintain the shear - current dynamo .",
    "in order to find the magnitude of the magnetic field , the nonlinear effects must be taken into account .",
