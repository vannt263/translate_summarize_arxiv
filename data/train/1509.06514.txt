    "possible physical mechanisms for such direct forces involve the solvent ( water ) binding properties with the bilayer surfaces  @xcite , or solvent structural properties  @xcite through a mechanism similar to wetting  @xcite in this latter case : with _ anti - symmetric _ boundary conditions at the bilayer ",
    "solvent interface , the order parameter profile of a ( non scalar ) property associated to solvent across the water channel , electric polarisation typically , would lead indeed to an effective _ repulsive _ interaction in the lamellar stack .",
    "interactions would nevertheless remain essentially attractive in the case of symmetric boundary conditions , as shown by richetti _",
    "_ in their study of a structure - prone ( pre - smectic ) solvent confined between solid surfaces  @xcite . in any case , `` hydration forces '' if they exist in this restricted sense would merely affect the _ magnitude _ of the second virial coefficient in the van der waals fluid analogy , increasing @xmath78 ( if attractive  more cohesion ) or decreasing @xmath78 ( if repulsive  less cohesion ) , which would only slightly displace the location of the critical temperature in the phase diagram .",

    "equilibrium is reached when water activity is the same in coexisting lamellar and polymer phases , which is easily deduced by observing the tubes characterised by a viscous and slightly turbid solution on top of a transparent polymer solution .",
    "osmotic equilibrium also implies that _ some _ lecithin or simulsol species are to be found in the polymer solution .",
    "the corresponding concentrations are , however , expected to be in the order of their respective critical micellar  aggregation  concentrations , viz . quite low . neglecting the amount of `` lost '' material in computing the lamellar phase lipid fraction , as well as neglecting the contribution of lipid aggregates to osmotic pressure are therefore safe approximations .",
    "the small - angle scattering experiments were carried out at the institute of physics , university of so paulo , brazil , with the xeuss instrument form xenocs equipped with a pilatus 300k detector ( dectris ) .",
    "radiation produced by the microfocus copper source is collected with a single - reflection multilayer optic producing a low - divergence , monochromatic beam with wavelength @xmath114  nm that is further collimated by a pair of scatterless slits ",
    "upstream slits 0.6@xmath1150.6  mm , downstream slits 0.5@xmath1150.5  mm .",
    "the sample - to - detector distance , calibrated with a silver behenate standard , is 0.77  m. detector images span in practice a scattering wave vector range extending from 0.04  nm@xmath116 to 3.5  nm@xmath116 .",
    "samples are held in glass capillaries with a nominal diameter of 1.5  mm , and the scattering intensity is corrected for background by subtracting the properly normalised signal of a capillary filled with pure water .",
    "exposure time varies from 15 up to 30 minutes , depending on the polymer solution concentration ."
