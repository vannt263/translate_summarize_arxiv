    "everyday experience seems to suggest that our world consists of four space - time dimensions .",
    "however , at the beginning of the @xmath0 century nordstrm , kaluza , and klein ( kk ) already realized that this may in fact not be the case @xcite . in the last few years there has again been a great deal of interest in models with extra dimensions , most notably due to the influence of string ( or m ) theory which in its usual formulation requires more than four dimensions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , this has led to a number of brane - world scenarios where all , or only some , of the gauge bosons are allowed to propagate in the extra dimensions while matter fields are restricted to -dimensional branes . for a review of different models with extra dimensions ,",
    "see , for example , @xcite and references therein .    in this context , a specific model of so - called universal extra dimensions ( ued )",
    "has recently been proposed by appelquist _",
    "@xcite , in which _ all _ standard model fields are allowed to propagate in the extra dimensions . as usual , quantization of the extra - dimensional momentum leads to a tower of kk states that appear as new massive particles in the effective four - dimensional theory .",
    "the existing constraints on electroweak observables translate into bounds on the compactification scale @xmath1 , which is related to the mass of the lowest excitations by @xmath2 . for one or two ued these bounds are of the order of a few hundred gev and thus within reach of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) or the fermilab tevatron run ii @xcite .",
    "the ued model is not only of great interest from the point of view of particle physics @xcite , but might also provide a solution to one of the most outstanding puzzles in modern cosmology  the nature of dark matter @xcite . in the ued scenario the lightest kk particle ( lkp ) is stable because of kk parity conservation and could therefore still be present today as a thermal relic .",
    "furthermore , if it is also neutral and nonbaryonic it has all the properties of a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , one of the most promising dark matter candidates ( see @xcite for a nice introduction to wimp dark matter ) . according to @xcite , both",
    "the kk photon ( @xmath3 ) and the kk neutrino could account for dark matter with @xmath4 , as suggested by the current cosmological concordance model @xcite , if one assumes a compactification scale of about @xmath5 size .",
    "indirect and direct detection properties of such kk dark matter candidates are promising for the next generation detectors @xcite .",
    "in fact , the kk neutrino seems to be ruled out already by present data @xcite .    however , when considering the freeze - out process and the further cosmological evolution of thermally produced lkps , the size of the extra dimensions has so far been assumed to stay constant  although no explicit stabilization mechanism has been given .",
    "as already noted in @xcite , the resulting relic density today depends crucially on this assumption , and it is therefore important to investigate whether it can be justified within the ued framework .",
    "since the ued may be relatively large ( in fact , they must be if the lkps are not to overclose the universe ) , their evolution should be governed by einstein s field equations .",
    "the aim of this work is therefore to carefully study the dynamics of the universe as described by an appropriate extension of the usual friedmann equations that results from the field equations in higher dimensions .",
    "specifically , we focus on solutions with constant or only slowly varying extra dimensions in the absence of any explicit stabilization mechanism .",
    "however , our analysis is more general in that we investigate whether there is _ any _ time evolution of the extra dimensions that corresponds to standard cosmology in four dimensions ; in this context , we also include a numerical study of the transition regime between the radiation- and matter - dominated eras . for earlier work on",
    "the stability properties of higher - dimensional cosmologies , often referred to as kaluza - klein or multidimensional cosmology , see , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ ued ]",
    "we introduce the cosmological solutions to einstein s field equations for a -dimensional homogeneous , but in general anisotropic , universe . here",
    ", we also comment on the interpretation of pressure in higher dimensions and derive a general relation between pressure and energy density in ued cosmology .",
    "necessary conditions that every solution with static extra dimensions in such a model must satisfy are then derived in sec .",
    "[ static ] . in the next two sections we study the existence of solutions with ( nearly ) constant extra dimensions during radiation and matter domination , respectively . a possible transition between these two regimes",
    "is then outlined in sec .",
    "[ trans ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ conc ] discusses the implications for the ued scenario and concludes .",
    "we introduce @xmath6 universal extra dimensions and adopt coordinates @xmath7 , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 being the coordinates for ordinary four - dimensional spacetime and three - dimensional ( 3d ) space respectively , and @xmath11 the coordinates for the ued . in the absence of a cosmological constant ,",
    "einstein s field equations are given by @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the higher - dimensional planck mass . in the case of compactified extra dimensions with volume",
    "@xmath16 it is related to the usual planck mass by @xcite @xmath17    in the ued scenario , there is no localization mechanism that confines particles to a brane , so we assume that the energy density is distributed homogeneously throughout all dimensions .",
    "thus , we are looking for homogeneous solutions to the field equations that are isotropic in ordinary three - dimensional space and also  but separately  in the space of extra dimensions .",
    "this can be described by the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric if we allow for different scale factors in 3d and the ued : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are maximally symmetric metrics in three and @xmath6 dimensions , respectively .",
    "spatial curvature is thus parametrized in the usual way by @xmath21 in ordinary space and @xmath22 in the ued .",
    "of course , one could imagine a model that is not described by the metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "for instance , there is no theoretical or observational argument against having separate scale factors for each extra dimension .",
    "we choose this metric because it is the simplest realistic alternative for studying dynamical extra dimensions .    with our choice of metric",
    ", the energy - momentum tensor must take the following form : @xmath23 which describes a homogeneous but in general anisotropic perfect fluid in its rest frame .",

    "we find , furthermore , @xmath29 for constant equations of state this can be integrated to give @xmath30 we will use a subscript @xmath31 to indicate arbitrary initial values throughout .",
    "the energy density and pressure appearing in the above equations are not the usual three - dimensional quantities but their higher - dimensional analogues . the pressure in some direction @xmath7",
    "is conventionally defined as the momentum flux through hypersurfaces of constant @xmath7 .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the momentum in direction @xmath7 , @xmath34 is the statistical weight and @xmath35 gives the phase space probability distribution .",
    "isotropy in our model means that @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "therefore we find @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the mass of the particles producing the pressure . in the case of different particle species one has to sum over all of them in eq .",

    "how can we recover standard cosmology with this setup ?",
    "let us first consider the case of highly relativistic particles and static , compact extra dimensions .",
    "equations ( [ fe00 ] ) and ( [ feij ] ) are then equivalent to the ordinary friedmann equations with three - dimensional energy density @xmath45 , pressure @xmath46 , and an effective cosmological constant @xmath47 given by    @xmath48    moreover , from eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) we then find the standard cosmological evolution of @xmath49 . for vanishing extra - dimensional curvature ,",
    "all we need in order to recover the familiar case of -dimensional radiation domination is to set @xmath50 .",
    "however , this forces us to allow for different pressures in ordinary space and the ued , since according to eq .",
    "( [ eos ] ) @xmath51 _ must _ then be close to zero .",
    "that is , the extra dimensional pressure ( and momentum ) must be negligible , and thus the kk tower must be largely unpopulated compared to the 3d radiation in order to reproduce standard cosmology for a radiation - dominated stage with @xmath52 .",
    "we also note that if lkps do form a substantial part of the dark matter , then from a -dimensional point of view ( ignoring a possible epoch of vacuum energy domination ) the universe is _ always _ dominated by relativistic particles .",
    "this is because any standard model particle with extra - dimensional momentum is automatically relativistic since @xmath53 . during ordinary radiation domination ,",
    "on the other hand , the contribution from dark matter is negligible  but then the dominant part of the energy density is relativistic anyway .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eos ] ) is always valid in our model .",
    "of course , we still want @xmath54 in order to describe what looks like a 3d matter dominated universe , so we have to set @xmath55 in that case .    on the other hand , for a time - dependent scale factor @xmath56 , eqs .",
    "( [ fe00 ] ) and  ( [ feij ] ) can still be cast in the standard cosmological form by absorbing all terms containing factors of @xmath56 and its derivatives into an _ effective _ three - dimensional energy density and pressure :    [ effective ] @xmath57 \\right\\ } \\ , , \\\\     p_{\\textrm{eff}}^{(3 ) } & \\equiv &   w_{\\textrm{eff } }    \\rho_{\\textrm{eff}}^{(3 ) } = \\frac{m_{pl}^2}{8     \\pi } \\left\\ { \\kappa^2 w_a \\rho + n { \\frac{{\\ddot{b}}}{b}}+ 2n { \\frac{{\\dot{a}}}{a}}{\\frac{{\\dot{b}}}{b}}+    \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2 } \\left [ \\left ( { \\frac{{\\dot{b}}}{b}}\\right)^2 + { \\frac{k_b}{b^2}}\\right ]    \\right\\ } \\ , . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note , however , that the actual three - dimensional energy density does _ not _ evolve in the standard manner : @xmath58 and there is no reason to expect that @xmath59 would either , if at the same time we want to keep the standard behavior of @xmath60 .",
    "finally , an era of effective radiation ( matter ) domination corresponding to @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) need not correspond to actual radiation ( matter ) domination , i.e.  @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that according to eq .",
    "( [ mpl ] ) one expects the gravitational coupling constant @xmath67 to vary with a time - dependent @xmath68 .",
    "since in the ued model all particles are allowed to propagate in all dimensions , a similar case can be made for other interactions .",
    "therefore , any nonstatic solution for @xmath56 must obey the tight observational bounds on the allowed cosmological variation of the gravitational and electromagnetic coupling constants ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "static extra dimensions is the only case considered so far in the ued context and we saw above that there may be severe problems reproducing standard cosmology otherwise .",
    "let us therefore study whether the field equations ( [ allfe ] ) admit static solutions for @xmath56 .",
    "taking the difference of twice eq .",
    "( [ fepq ] ) and the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ fe00 ] ) and three times  ( [ feij ] ) gives @xmath69 from this we can immediately read off a necessary condition for exactly static extra dimensions : @xmath70    if the extra dimensions are flat ( for @xmath71 , the curvature is automatically zero ) , this requires the universe to be empty ( @xmath72 ) or the equations of state to satisfy the following constraint : @xmath73 which agrees with the five - dimensional models considered in @xcite . in both cases , setting @xmath74 reduces eqs .",

    "( [ econserv ] ) then implies @xmath78 .",
    "the origin of such an energy density could , for example , be a -dimensional cosmological constant @xmath79 , for which @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "setting @xmath74 then reduces eqs .",

    "( [ staticcondition ] ) .",
    "curved , static extra dimensions are thus possible in principle , but only for constant @xmath76 .",
    "recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe is flat to a high degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "we therefore set the 3d curvature to zero .",
    "moreover , we have shown that static extra dimensions are incompatible with extra - dimensional curvature in the case of non - negative pressure in 3d .",
    "although the latest results from type ia supernovae observations strongly suggest that the presently dominating energy component indeed _ does _ have negative pressure @xcite , such a component , be it a cosmological constant or a quintessence field , is believed to be negligible until relatively recently and it therefore can not provide static , curved extra dimensions at earlier times . thus we take @xmath83 from here on .",
    "shortly after freeze - out the lkp contribution should be negligible and the total energy density of the universe is therefore dominated by ordinary radiation , i.e. ,  the kk tower is largely unpopulated compared to relativistic particles with no extra - dimensional momentum .",
    "equation ( [ eos ] ) then implies that the extra - dimensional pressure should be negligible .",
    "now , combining eqs .",
    "( [ eos ] ) and ( [ flatstat ] ) we find that @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the _ only _ choice for the equations of state in a universe that is dominated by relativistic particles and has exactly static ued : @xmath86 furthermore , we have already seen that this choice reproduces standard cosmological radiation domination in that the scale factor and energy density evolve as @xmath87 thus in the ued scenario , static extra dimensions arise naturally during radiation domination .",
    "however , from our discussion on pressure , we do not expect @xmath77 and @xmath51 to take exactly these values and we must therefore consider perturbations of the static solution .",
    "so let us assume that @xmath88 and look for solutions of the form    [ pert ] @xmath89    where a star denotes the unperturbed solutions ( [ b0])([rho0 ] ) and @xmath90 , with corresponding relations for the time derivatives of these quantities . the linearized versions of the field equations  ( [ allfe ] ) are then given by    @xmath91    subtracting the unperturbed equations this can be rewritten as    @xmath92    equations  ( [ uncoupled2 ] ) and  ( [ uncoupled3 ] ) are uncoupled differential equations for @xmath93 and @xmath94 which can be solved after inserting the unperturbed solutions ( [ a0 ] ) , ( [ rho0 ] ) . equation ( [ uncoupled1 ] ) can be interpreted as defining @xmath95 and is thus automatically satisfied .",
    "the general solutions are found to be :    [ general ] @xmath96    where @xmath97,@xmath98,@xmath99,@xmath100 are integration constants fixed by the initial conditions at time @xmath101 .",
    "note that @xmath97 and @xmath99 can just as well be regarded as part of the initial conditions for the unperturbed solutions @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "thus for @xmath75 we find only decaying solutions for the perturbations in both scale factors ",
    "i.e.  the static solution given by eqs .",
    "( [ b0]),([a0 ] ) is stable under small perturbations , as claimed previously ( without proof ) in @xcite .    in the case of @xmath104 , however , there might also exist a growing solution .",
    "for example , a constant @xmath51 gives is considered in sec .",
    "[ trans ] , where we find a more rapid growth of @xmath94 . ]",
    "@xmath105    since the relative perturbations of the scale factors grow only logarithmically in both cases , @xmath106 these perturbations can still be expected to remain relatively small during radiation domination after lkp freeze - out .",
    "we have shown that there are approximately static solutions for the ued during radiation domination .",
    "in fact , we found that @xmath84 and @xmath75 is the only possible choice for the equations of state that can give exactly static , flat extra dimensions in a universe dominated by relativistic particles .",
    "however , as we remarked before , the universe is _ always _ dominated by relativistic particles if a significant amount of the dark matter is made up of lkps .",
    "it is therefore clear that there are _ no _ exactly static solutions for the ued during matter domination , i.e.  @xmath107 .    having excluded exactly static extra dimensions , the next case of interest would be slowly evolving solutions : @xmath108 but what ansatz should we make for @xmath60 ?",
    "a significant , long - term deviation from the usual time evolution during matter domination would most likely alter the predictions of standard cosmology concerning , e.g. , large - scale structure formation .",
    "let us therefore first examine whether there are any solutions to the field equations that give @xmath109 we noted before that @xmath110 implies @xmath111 .",
    "the field equations  ( [ allfe ] ) can then be rewritten as two homogeneous equations for @xmath112 and @xmath113 and one defining equation for @xmath76 . with the above expression for @xmath60 we get    @xmath114    differentiating eq .",
    "( [ md_fe3 ] ) , one finds that the last two equations are inconsistent with each other for @xmath115 , so there are _ no _ solutions with @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "neither can there be any solutions with @xmath107 and @xmath60 of the form @xmath118 where @xmath119 then @xmath120 and @xmath121 need not be small .",
    "we do not consider such behavior here .",
    "so are there any solutions to the field equations at all during matter domination ? with the quite general ansatz @xmath122 we find that all solutions are of the form @xmath123 some of these , namely @xmath124 are vacuum solutions .",
    "in fact , they are known as kasner - type solutions and have been found before under the _ assumption _ of an empty universe and a power - law behaviour of both scale factors @xcite .",
    "the only additional solutions appear when @xmath125 and are given by @xmath126 with @xmath127 being an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "although they describe a nonempty universe they have a static scale factor @xmath60 .",
    "of course , for @xmath128 we knew of this solution beforehand , since @xmath110 and @xmath129 is the static , radiation dominated solution with @xmath60 and @xmath56 interchanged .    with no suitable solutions describing actual matter domination ( @xmath130 ) , we turn to the possibility of an era of effective matter domination , i.e. ,  @xmath131 . inserting the defining eqs .",
    "( [ effective ] ) into the field equations  ( [ allfe ] ) then yields the familiar result @xmath132 by construction . using eq .",

    "we find that a natural  and in fact the only  way to get exactly static extra dimensions in this scenario is to set @xmath176 and @xmath75 .",
    "this also reproduces the usual radiation - dominated behavior of the scale factor in 3d . allowing for @xmath177 ,",
    "which is much more realistic in the ued scenario , we still find approximately constant extra dimensions and @xmath178 .",
    "however , during matter domination ( @xmath110 ) there are no static solutions for the extra dimensions .",
    "even worse , there are no solutions at all that are consistent with the standard matter dominated behavior of the scale factor in 3d , @xmath179 . with a more general ansatz @xmath180 we do find solutions , but for @xmath181 they all describe an empty universe .",
    "demanding @xmath182 instead of @xmath183 we get the usual behavior of @xmath184 by construction , but the corresponding solutions for @xmath185 and @xmath186 are unphysical .    in the reasonable approximation that the lkps have only extra - dimensional momentum ,",
    "we have also performed a numerical analysis of the transition from a radiation dominated universe with approximately static ued to one with a sizable energy density contribution from lkps .",
    "the evolution of @xmath56 is generically found to be much too rapid given the present bounds on the time variation of the electromagnetic and gravitational coupling constants , and @xmath60 does not show the standard behavior either .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that , within our framework , an explicit mechanism is needed not only to stabilize the ued but also to reproduce standard cosmology in 3d during matter domination . although one could consider more complex models , e.g. ,  with different scale factors for each extra dimension , we believe that finding static solutions  or indeed any solutions which give standard cosmology for both radiation and matter domination without obviously violating experimental bounds on the evolution of the extra dimensions  is a generic difficulty of this scenario .",
