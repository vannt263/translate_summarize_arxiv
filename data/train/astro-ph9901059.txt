    "the extraction of the cosmic far infrared background ( cfirb ) , induced by the emission of light from distant galaxies ( partridge & peebles , 1967 ; bond et al . , 1986 and references therein ) , requires an accurate subtraction of the interstellar medium ( ism ) foreground emissions .",
    "the two instruments dirbe and firas on board the cobe satellite provide actually the best available data to study , on the whole sky , the distribution and properties of the ism far infrared ( far - ir ) emission .",
    "+ boulanger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have extensively studied the emission of the dust associated with the hi component using the spatial correlation between the far - ir dust emission as measured by dirbe and firas and the 21 cm hi emission as measured by the leiden / dwingeloo survey of the northern hemisphere .",
    "the dust emission spectrum derived from this correlation ( for n@xmath10  4.5  10@xmath11  @xmath12 ) can be quite well represented by a single modified planck curve characterized by t=17.5  k and @xmath13  @xmath8 .",
    "this emissivity law is very close to the one predicted by the draine @xmath14 lee ( 1984 ) dust model .",
    "+ dust emission associated with molecular clouds has been recently studied through far - ir and submillimeter ( submm ) observations with the dirbe , firas and spm / pronaos instruments . in a previous paper ( lagache et al . , 1998 ) , we have extensively studied the spatial distribution of the temperature of the dust at thermal equilibrium using the dirbe and firas experiment .",
    "we have found at large angular scale the presence of a cold dust component ( with a median temperature of 15 k ) , very well correlated with molecular complexes with low star forming activity such as taurus .",
    "the lowest values of the temperature found in the cold regions ( @xmath15  k ) are comparable with that obtained for dense clouds in star forming regions by the balloon - borne experiment spm / pronaos ( ristorcelli et al . , 1996 , 1998 , serra et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the association between the cold dust component and molecular clouds is further demonstrated by the fact that all sky pixels with significant cold emission have an excess ir emission with respect to the high latitude ir / hi correlation .",
    "a threshold value of the column density , n@xmath16=2.5  @xmath17  h  @xmath12 , below which cold dust is not detected within the firas beam of @xmath18 has been deduced .",
    "this knowledge on the spatial distribution of the dust associated with cold molecular clouds is important for the search of the cfirb since it allows to select parts of the sky for which cold dust is not detected .",
    "+ on the other hand , the knowledge of the dust emission associated with the h@xmath0 component is very poor .",
    "observations of h@xmath19 emission at high galactic latitudes and of dispersion measures in the direction of pulsars at high @xmath20 indicate that the low - density ionised gas ( the warm interstellar medium , wim ) accounts for some 30@xmath2 of the gas in the solar neighborhood ( reynolds , 1989 ) .",
    "there is also evidence that part of the wim is spatially correlated with the hi gas ( reynolds et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "consequently , a significant fraction of the far - ir emission associated with the wim may contribute to the spectrum of the dust associated with the hi gas .",
    "however , the scale height of the h@xmath0 medium is much larger than the hi one , so a significant part of the h@xmath0 is completely uncorrelated with the hi .",
    "since most of the grain destruction is expected to occur in the low - density component of the ism ( mc kee 1989 ) , the wim could also be dust poor .",
    "depletion studies of elements that form the grains show that grains are indeed partly destroyed in the low density phases of the ism ( review by savage & sembach , 1996 ) . measuring",
    "the dust emission from the wim could allow to understand the evolution of the dust in the low - density gas . however , this measure is difficult because one can not easily separate the contribution of the h@xmath0 gas from that of the hi .",
    "boulanger & perault ( 1988 ) unsuccessfully searched in the 100  @xmath4 iras all - sky map for such a contribution .",
    "the unfruitful analysis may be due to the spatial correlation between the hi and h@xmath0 emissions .",
    "boulanger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have searched for such a component in the residual firas emission after the removal of the hi component .",
    "they found that the residual emission is consistent with an emission spectrum like that of the hi gas for n@xmath21  4  10@xmath22  @xmath12 .",
    "however , they consider this as an upper limit for the contribution of the h@xmath0 component since they could have measured emission from low contrasted molecular clouds .",
    "arendt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have also investigated potential ir wim dust emission .",
    "they conclude that they were unable to detect any ir emission associated with low density ionised gas at high galactic latitude ( the fraction of the sky used is less than 0.3@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , very recently , howk & savage ( 1999 ) have pointed out , for the first time , the existence of al- and fe - bearing dust grains towards two high - z stars .",
    "they have shown that the degree of grain destruction in the ionised medium , through these two stars , is not much higher than in the warm neutral medium .",
    "if dust is present in the wim , one should detect its infrared emission .",
    "+ the cfirb is expected to have two components : direct starlight redshifted in the far - ir and submm , and the stellar radiation absorbed by dust .",
    "we concentrate here on the submm part of this background .",
    "its detection is very difficult because of the strong and fluctuating galactic foregrounds .",
    "first , upper limits have been reported : hauser et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from dirbe data and mather et al .",
    "( 1994 ) from firas data .",
    "lower limits on the cfirb have been obtained from the deepest iras and k galaxy counts ( hauser et al . , 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "the first direct detection of the cfirb has been reported by puget et al .",
    "all the galactic foregrounds were modeled and removed using independant dataset in addition to the firas data .",
    "its spectrum indicates the presence of sources at large redshift . the main uncertainty on the cfirb comes from galactic foregrounds .",
    "therefore , we stress that the puget et al . ( 1996 ) results were confirmed in the cleanest parts ( n@xmath23  @xmath12 in a 7@xmath24 beam ) of the sky ( guiderdoni et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , fixsen et al . ( 1998 ) and hauser et al . (",
    "1998 ) have also confirmed the detection of the cfirb using firas and dirbe data . +",
    "a general problem with all these determinations of the cfirb comes from a potential far - ir emission from the wim which has never been determined .",
    "the goal of this paper is to push our knowledge of the galactic emission one step forward by deriving the far - ir spectrum of the wim dust emission .",
    "then , we use our understanding of the interstellar dust emissions associated with the hi and h@xmath0 components to give a more accurate estimate of the cfirb spectrum .",

    "the present study is based on `` pass 2 '' data .",
    "+ since in our analysis we combine the firas and dirbe data at 140 and 240  @xmath4 , we convolve the dirbe maps with the firas point spread function ( psf ) . the psf is not precisely known for all wavelengths , so we use the approximation suggested by mather ( private communication ) of a @xmath25 diameter circle convolved with a line of @xmath30 length perpendicular to the ecliptic plane ( mather et al .",
    "+ before studying the far - ir emission , we have subtracted the cmb and its dipole emission from the firas data using the parameters given by mather et al .",

    "( 1998 ) . to remove molecular clouds and hii regions , we use the dirbe map of the 240  @xmath4 excess with respect to the 60@xmath4 emission : @xmath38s = s@xmath39(240)-  c@xmath40s@xmath39(60 ) with c=4@xmath60.7 .",

    "<S> we present a new analysis of the far - ir emission at high galactic latitude based on cobe and hi data . </S>",
    "<S> a decomposition of the far - ir emission over the hi , h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 galactic gas components and the cosmic far infrared background ( cfirb ) is described . </S>",
    "<S> + for the first time the far - ir emission of dust associated with the warm ionised medium ( wim ) is evidenced . </S>",
    "<S> this component determined on about 25@xmath2 of the sky is detected at a 10@xmath3 level in the [ 200 , 350 ]  @xmath4 band . </S>",
    "<S> the best representation of the wim dust spectrum is obtained for a temperature of 29.1 k and an emissivity law @xmath5  3.8  @xmath6  0.8  @xmath7  @xmath8 . with a spectral index equal to 2 </S>",
    "<S> , the emissivity law becomes @xmath5  1.0  @xmath6  0.2  @xmath9  @xmath8 , with a temperature of 20  k , which is significantly higher than the temperature of dust associated with hi gas . </S>",
    "<S> the variation in the dust spectrum from the hi to the wim component can be explained by only changing the upper cutoff of the big grain size distribution from 0.1  @xmath4 to 30 nm . </S>",
    "<S> + the detection of ir emission of dust in the wim significantly decreases the intensity of the cfirb , especially around 200  @xmath4 which corresponds to the peak of energy . + </S>"
