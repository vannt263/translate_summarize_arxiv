    "there is now compelling evidence to suggest that a substantial fraction of all gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) occur at cosmological distances ( red shift @xmath2 ) . in particular ,",
    "the measured red shift @xmath3 for grb  971214 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) , and @xmath4 for grb  990123 ( kulkarni et al . 1999 ) implies an energy release of @xmath5erg and @xmath6erg respectively , in the @xmath0-rays alone , assuming isotropic emission .",
    "the latter energy estimate could be substantially reduced if the energy emission is not isotropic , but displays a jet - like geometry ( dar 1998 ; kulkarni et al . 1999 ) .",
    "models in which the burst is produced by a narrow jet are able to explain the complex temporal structure observed in many grbs ( sari et al . 1997 ; 1999 ) . in any case , a cosmological origin of grbs leads to the conclusion of a huge energy output . depending on the degree of burst beaming and on the efficiency of @xmath0-ray production , the central engine powering these extraordinary events should be capable of releasing a total energy of a few @xmath7erg .    many cosmological models for grbs have been proposed . among the most popular",
    "is the merging of two neutron stars ( or a neutron star and a black hole ) in a binary system ( paczynski 1998 ) .",
    "recent results ( janka & ruffert 1996 ) within this model , indicate that , even under the most favorable conditions , the energy provided by @xmath8 annihilation during the merger is too small by at least an order of magnitude , and more probably two or three orders of magnitude , to power typical grbs at cosmological distances .",
    "an alternative model is the so  called `` failed supernova '' ( woosley 1993 ) , or `` hypernova '' model ( paczynski 1998 ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider the conversion of a neutron star to a strange star ( hereafter ns@xmath9ss conversion ) as a possible central engine for grbs .",
    "in particular , we focus on the energetics of the ns@xmath9ss conversion , and not on the mechanism by which @xmath0-rays are produced . previous estimate of the total energy @xmath10 released in the ns@xmath9ss conversion ( olinto 1987 ; cheng & dai 1996 ) or in the conversion of a neutron star to hybrid star ( ma & xie 1996 ) gave @xmath11erg , too low to power grbs at cosmological distances .",
    "these calculations did not include the various details of the neutron star and strange star structural properties , which go into the binding energy release considerations . here",
    ", we present accurate and systematic calculations of the total energy released in the ns@xmath9ss conversion using different models for the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron star matter ( nsm ) and strange quark matter ( sqm ) . we show that the total amount of energy liberated in the conversion is in the range @xmath12(14)@xmath1erg , in agreement with the energy required to power @xmath0-ray burst sources at cosmological distances .",
    "the existence of strange stars ( made up of degenerate u , d , and s quarks in equilibrium with respect to the weak interactions ) is allowable within uncertainties inherent in our present theoretical understanding of the physics of strongly interacting matter ( bodmer 1971 ; witten 1984 ; farhi & jaffe 1984 ) .",
    "thus , strange stars may exist in the universe , but until now , these have remained purely speculative entities .",
    "this situation changed in the last few years , thanks to the large amount of new observational data collected by the new generation of x - ray satellites .",
    "in fact , recent studies have shown that the compact objects associated with the x - ray bursters gro j1744 - 28 ( cheng et al .",
    "1998 ) , sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( li et al .",
    "1999a ) , and with the x - ray pulsar her x-1 ( dey et al .",
    "1998 ) are good strange star candidates .",
    "recently , li et al .",
    "( 1999b ) have shown that the observed high and low  frequency quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the atoll source 4u 1728 - 34 ( mndez & van der klis 1999 ) , are more consistent with a strange star compared to a neutron star , if the model of osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) correctly interprets the qpo phenomena .    originally , the idea that grbs could be powered by the conversion of a neutron star to a strange star was proposed by alcock _",
    "( 1986 ) ( see also olinto ( 1987 ) ) , and recently reconsidered by other authors ( cheng & dai 1996 ) .",
    "a similar model has been discussed by ma and xie ( 1996 ) for the conversion of a neutron star to a so  called hybrid star ( a neutron star with a strange quark matter core ) .",
    "a number of different mechanisms have been proposed for the ns@xmath9ss conversion .",
    "all of them are based on the formation of a `` seed '' of sqm inside the neutron star .",
    "for example , ( i ) a seed of sqm enters in a ns and converts it to a ss ( olinto 1987 ) .",
    "these seeds of sqm , according to witten ( 1984 ) , are relics of the primordial quark ",
    "hadron phase transition microseconds after the big bang .",
    "( ii ) a seed of sqm forms in the core of a neutron star as a result of a phase transition from neutron star matter to deconfined strange quark matter ( nsm@xmath9sqm phase transition ) .",
    "this could possibly happen when a neutron star ( ns ) is a member of a binary stellar system .",
    "the ns accretes matter from the companion star .",
    "the central density of the ns increases and it may overcome the critical density for the nsm@xmath9sqm phase transition .",
    "the ns is then converted to a ss . in the case of accretion induced conversion in a binary stellar system , the conversion rate has been estimated ( cheng & dai 1996 ) to be in the range ( 330)@xmath13 conversions per day per galaxy .",
    "this rate is consistent with the observed grbs rate .",
    "however , once there is a seed of sqm inside a neutron star , it is possible to calculate the rate of growth ( olinto 1987 ; horvath & benvenuto 1988 ) .",
    "the sqm front absorbs neutrons , protons , and hyperons ( if present ) , liberating their constituent quarks .",
    "weak equilibrium is then re - established by the weak interactions . as shown by horvath and benvenuto ( 1988 )",
    ", the conversion of the whole star will then occur in a very short time ( detonation mode ) , in the range 1  ms  1",
    "s , which is in agreement with the typical observed duration of grbs .",
    "a detailed simulation of the conversion process is still lacking , and only rough estimates of the total energy liberated in the conversion have been made .    as we show below , the dominant contribution to @xmath10 arises from the internal energy released in the conversion , _",
    "i.e. _ in the nsm@xmath9sqm phase transition",
    ". moreover , the gravitational mass of the star will change during the conversion process , even under the assumption that the total number of baryons in the star is conserved .    the total energy released in the ns@xmath9ss conversion is given by the difference between the total binding energy of the strange star be(ss ) and the total binding energy of the neutron star be(ns ) e^conv = be(ss ) - be(ns ) in the present work we assume that the baryonic mass @xmath14 of the compact object is conserved in the conversion process , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath10 is given in terms of the difference between the gravitational mass of the ns and ss :   @xmath16c^2 $ ] .",
    "in general the total binding energy for a compact object can be written @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the internal and gravitational binding energies respectively , and @xmath20 is the proper mass of the compact object defined as m_p = _ 0^r dr 4r^2 ^-1/2 ( r )  , [ eq : pmass ] @xmath21 being the total mass  energy density and @xmath22 the gravitational mass enclosed within a spherical volume of radius @xmath23 .",
    "the proper mass is equal to the sum of the mass elements on the whole volume of the star ; it includes the contributions of rest mass and internal energy ( kinetic and interactions ( other than gravitation ) ) of the constituents of the star .",
    "the total conversion energy can then be written as the sum of two contributions e^conv = e^conv_i + e^conv_g related to the internal and gravitational energy changes in the conversion .",
    "these two contributions can be written as : e^conv_i = be_i(ss ) - be_i(ns ) = [ m_p(ns ) - m_p(ss)]c^2 , e^conv_g = be_g(ss ) - be_g(ns ) = [ m_p(ss ) - m_g(ss ) - m_p(ns ) + m_g(ns)]c^2 , and these can be evaluated solving the structural equations for non - rotating compact objects ( oppenheimer & volkoff 1939 ) . to highlight the dependence of @xmath10 upon the present uncertainties in the microphysics",
    ", we employed different models for the eos of both nsm and sqm .",
    "recently , a microscopic eos of dense stellar matter has been calculated by baldo et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and used to compute the structure of static ( baldo et al . 1997 ) as well as rapidly rotating neutron stars ( datta et al . 1998 ) . in this model for the eos ,",
    "the neutron star core is composed of asymmetric nuclear matter in equilibrium , with respect to the weak interactions , with electrons and muons ( @xmath24-stable matter ) .",
    "in particular , we consider their eos based on the argonne @xmath2514 nucleon - nucleon interaction implemented by nuclear three - body forces ( hereafter bbb1 eos ) .    at the high densities expected in the core of a neutron star , additional baryonic states besides",
    "the neutron and the proton may be present , including the hyperons @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the isospin 3/2 nucleon resonance @xmath30 .",
    "the equation of state of this hyperonic matter is traditionally investigated in the framework of lagrangian field theory in the mean field approximation ( glendenning 1985 ; schaffner & mishustin 1996 ; prakash et al .",
    "according to this model , the onset for hyperon formation in @xmath24-stable  charged neutral dense matter is about 23 times the normal nuclear matter density ( @xmath31  @xmath32 ) .",
    "the latter result has been confirmed by recent microscopic calculations based on the brueckner - hartree - fock theory ( baldo et al .",
    "the appearance of hyperons , in general , gives a softening of the eos with respect to the pure nucleonic case . in the present work we considered one of the eos for hyperonic matter given in prakash et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    for strange quark matter , we consider a simple eos ( farhi and jaffe 1984 ) based on the mit bag model for hadrons",
    "we begin with the case of massless non - interacting ( @xmath33 ) quarks and with a bag constant @xmath34 mev/@xmath35 : we denote the corresponding eos as @xmath36 .",
    "next we consider a finite value for the mass of the strange quark within the same mit bag model eos .",
    "we take @xmath37  mev ( and @xmath38 , @xmath34 mev/@xmath35 , and @xmath33 ; hereafter eos @xmath39 ) . to investigate the effect of the bag constant on the energy released in the ns@xmath9ss conversion , we take ( almost ) the largest possible value of @xmath40 for which sqm is still the ground state of strongly interacting matter , according to the so  called _ strange matter hypothesis _ ( witten 1984 ) . for massless",
    "non - interacting quarks this gives @xmath41 mev/@xmath35 ; we denote the corresponding eos as @xmath42 .",
    "recently , dey _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) derived an eos for sqm using a different quark model with respect to the mit bag model .",
    "the eos by dey _",
    "_ has asymptotic freedom built in , shows confinement at zero baryon density , deconfinement at high density , and , for an appropriate choice of the eos parameters entering in the model , gives absolutely stable sqm according to the strange matter hypothesis . in this model , the quark interaction is described by a screened inter ",
    "quark vector potential originating from gluon exchange , and by a density - dependent scalar potential which restores the chiral symmetry at high density .",
    "the density - dependent scalar potential arises from the density dependence of the in - medium effective quark masses @xmath43 , which , in the model by dey et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , are taken to depend upon the baryon number density @xmath44 according to @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the normal nuclear matter density , @xmath47 is the flavor index , and @xmath48 is a parameter .",
    "the effective quark mass @xmath49 goes from its constituent masses at zero density , to its current mass @xmath50 , as @xmath44 goes to infinity .",
    "here we consider two different parameterizations of the eos by dey _ et al .",
    "_ , which correspond to a different choice for the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the equation of state ss1 ( ss2 ) corresponds to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "to begin with , we fix as a `` standard '' eos for neutron star matter the bbb1 eos ( baldo et al .",
    "1997 ) , to explore how the energy budget in the ns@xmath9ss conversion depends on the details of the eos for strange quark matter .",
    "first we consider the @xmath36 equation of state . the ns@xmath9ss conversion based on this couple of eoss ,",
    "will be referred to as the bbb1@xmath53 conversion model .",
    "similar notation will be employed according to the eos of nsm and sqm .",
    "the total conversion energy , together with the partial contributions , is shown in the upper panel of fig .  1 .",
    "as we can see , for @xmath14 larger than @xmath54 ( _ i.e. _ values of the baryonic mass compatible with the measured neutron star gravitational masses ) the total energy released in the ns@xmath9ss conversion is in the range ( 13)@xmath1erg , one order of magnitude larger than previous estimates ( olinto 1987 ; cheng & dai 1996 ; ma & xie 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , contrary to a common expectation , the gravitational conversion energy @xmath55 is negative for this couple of eoss . to make a more quantitative analysis",
    ", we consider a neutron star with a baryonic mass @xmath56 ( see tab .",
    "1 ) , which has a gravitational mass @xmath57 , a radius r(ns ) = 11.0  km , and a gravitational binding energy be@xmath58(ns ) = 4.497 @xmath1  erg . after conversion",
    ", the corresponding strange star has @xmath59 , r(ss ) = 10.5  km , and be@xmath58(ss ) = 3.061 @xmath1  erg .",
    "the ns@xmath9ss conversion is energetically possible in this case , thanks to the large amount of ( internal ) energy liberated in the nsm@xmath9sqm phase transition .",
    "similar qualitative results for the total conversion energy are obtained for other choices of the two eoss , but as we show below the magnitude of the two partial contributions are strongly dependent on the underlying eos for nsm and sqm .",
    "the total conversion energy for the bbb1@xmath60 model is plotted in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "1 . comparing with the previous case , we notice that the strange quark mass produces a large modification of the conversion energy , which is reduced by a factor between 23 with respect to the case @xmath61 .",
    "the bag constant @xmath40 has also a sizeable influence on the conversion energy .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath40 reduces @xmath10 and strongly modifies @xmath55 .",
    "this can be seen comparing the results for the bbb1@xmath53 conversion model with those in the lower right panel of fig .  1 for the bbb1@xmath62 model",
    ". these results are a consequence of the sizeable effects of the strange quark mass and of the bag constant mainly on the internal binding energy @xmath63 for strange stars ( see _ e.g. _ bombaci 1999 ) .",
    "in fact , all strange stars configurations within the @xmath36 eos are self  bound objects ( _ i.e. _ @xmath64 ) .",
    "strange star configurations within the @xmath65 ( @xmath39 ) eos are self  bound objects up to @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , to compare with the corresponding maximum gravitational mass @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the results depicted in the two upper panels of fig .",
    "2 have been obtained using the eos of dey _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) for sqm , for two different choices of the parameter @xmath48 which controls the rate at which chiral symmetry is restored to the quark masses at high density . for @xmath52 ( ss2 ) ,",
    "chiral symmetry is broken up to larger densities with respect to the case @xmath51 ( ss1 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 has a strong influence on the internal binding energy of the strange star .",
    "in fact , we found that strange stars within the ss2 ( ss1 ) eos are self  bound objects up to @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , to compare with the maximum gravitational mass @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "this effect is the main source for the differences in the calculated conversion energies for the two conversion models bbb1@xmath9ss1 and bbb1@xmath9ss2 .",
    "the next step in our study is to consider a different neutron star matter eos , which allows for the presence of hyperons in the neutron star core .",
    "we consider one of the eos ( hereafter hyp ) for hyperonic matter given in prakash et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in the two lower panels of fig .  2 we plot the total conversion energy , together with the partial contributions , for the hyp@xmath74 and for the hyp@xmath9ss1 conversion models .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with those reported in the previous figures .      in the present work , we considered the conversion of a neutron star to a strange star as a possible energy source for @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "our main focus was to perform an accurate calculation of the total released energy compatible with our current understanding of the microphysics of strong interacting matter .",
