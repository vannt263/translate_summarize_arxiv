    "antimatter search in cosmic rays ( crs ) are especially important for astrophysics and dark matter signal study . in recent years , there were great progresses in the measurements of cr antimatter particles .",
    "in particular , the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams-02 ) launched in 2011 has provided unprecedentedly precise measurement of crs .",
    "based on the results from ams-02 and previous experiments , such as pamela and fermi - lat , the properties of cr antimatter particles have been extensively studied in a quantitative way in the literature .    recently , the ams-02 collaboration has reported their measurement of the @xmath0 ratio up to @xmath1  gev with a high precision  @xcite .",
    "the previous pamela @xmath0 ratio data  @xcite seemed to be compatible with the conventional cr prediction in the energy range of @xmath4  gev , and can be used to set limits on the dm annihilation cross section or lifetime  @xcite .",
    "however , it is very interesting to note that the ams-02 @xmath0 ratio becomes almost flat from @xmath5  gev to several hundred gev .",
    "this behavior is not expected from the cr secondary production since the measured b / c ratio decreases with energy as a power - law spectrum without any structure .",
    "therefore it is necessary to perform a careful study on the secondary production of antiprotons taking all the uncertainties into account .",
    "the major challenge to interpret the ams-02 data is how to give an accurate prediction of the secondary antiprotons .",
    "although the ams-02 collaboration has provided precise measurements of the proton and helium spectra , there are still large uncertainties from cr propagation processes",
    ". the complicated cr propagation in the galaxy may involve diffusion , energy loss , convection , and reacceleration effects .",
    "the propagation parameters describing these effects can be determined by fitting the secondary - to - primary ratios , such as b / c and ( sc+ti+v)/fe , and unstable - to - stable ratios of secondary particles , such as @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "however , current measurements of these ratios are still not sufficient to distinguish different propagation models .",
    "another important uncertainty comes from the solar modulation , which significantly affects low energy cr spectra , but it is not easy to quantify the effects .    in this work , we give first a careful analysis of the secondary antiproton production .",
    "the galprop package is used to solve the cr propagation equation  @xcite .",
    "we adopt two kinds of propagation models , namely the diffusion - reacceleration ( dr ) model and diffusion - convection ( dc ) model .",
    "propagation parameters are determined by fitting the available b / c data with a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc , @xcite ) algorithm  @xcite , which is powerful for surveying high dimensional parameter space .",
    "secondary antiprotons from cr interactions with the ism are calculated and the uncertainties from propagation effects are obtained .",
    "taking all the uncertainties into account , the secondary antiprotons seem marginally consistent with ams-02 results , but show clearly different slope with energy",
    ".    then we study the implications of the ams-02 @xmath8 data on dm annihilation signals .",
    "since the ams-02 data do not unambiguously indicate an excess , we derive upper limits on the dm annihilation rate and signal regions where the background plus dm signals give a good fit to the ams-02 data . in order to derive upper limits or signals regions ,",
    "we carry out a global fitting to the ams-02 data with the mcmc method . based on the ams-02 @xmath0 data , upper limits on the dm annihilation rate and favored dm annihilation parameters",
    "have also been given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the cr propagation processes . in sec .",
    "iii , we first determine the propagation parameters from the ams-02 b / c ratio data and then calculate the secondary antiproton flux . in sec .",
    "iv , we study implication on dm annihilation by the ams-02 @xmath0 ratio data .",
    "finally , we give the discussions and conclusions in sec .  v.",
    "after accelerated in sources , galactic crs are injected and diffuse in the interstellar space and suffer from several propagation effects before they arrive at the earth .",
    "a conventional assumption is that crs propagate in a cylindrical halo with a half height @xmath9 , beyond which crs escape freely .",
    "the propagation equation can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath10 \\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\\left [ \\dot{p}\\psi - \\frac{p}{3}(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{v}_c)\\psi \\right ] - \\frac{\\psi}{\\tau_f } - \\frac{\\psi}{\\tau_r } , \\label{propagation_equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the cr density per momentum interval , @xmath12 is the source term , @xmath13 is the momentum loss rate , and the time scales @xmath14 and @xmath15 characterize fragmentation processes and radioactive decays , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]            fig .  [",
    "fig : dm_sv ] also shows the favored regions at 68% and 95% c.l . in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane .",
    "the favored values of @xmath17 are highly correlated with the values of @xmath16 , since the dm source term is proportional to @xmath18 , as indicated in eq .  .",
    "since the dm annihilations into quarks or gauge bosons also produce high energy photons , @xmath19-ray observations , such as those from fermi - lat , would set strong constraints on the dm annihilation cross section .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm_sv ] are the upper limits from the observations of spheroidal dwarf galaxies with six - year fermi - lat gamma - ray data @xcite .",
    "it can be found that the constraint from ams-02 is similar to that derived from fermi - lat dwarf galaxy observation .",
    "in this work we investigate the new ams-02 results of @xmath0 ratio . in order to understand the data ,",
    "the crucial step is to perform a reliable study on the secondary antiproton flux generated by cr interactions with the ism .",
    "we consider three propagation models , namely the dr , dr-2 and dc models defined in tab .",
    "[ tab : propmodel ] .",
    "the prorogation parameters are constrained by the b / c data using a mcmc algorithm .",
    "we find that all the models can provide very good fit to the b / c data .    within @xmath20 ranges of the fitted propagation parameters ,",
    "we give the predictions of the secondary antiprotons in the three propagation models and compared them with the ams-02 @xmath0 data .",
    "it is found that the dr model underproduces antiprotons at low energies , which has already been noticed for a long time",
    ". the dr-2 and dc models can give a quite good fit to the ams-02 data below @xmath21  gev .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the predicted secondary @xmath0 ratio above @xmath21 gev has a different slop from the ams-02 data .",
    "the data keep flat up to @xmath1  gev , but the predictions of all the three models decrease with the energy .",
    "the key factor is that the diffusion coefficient is in a form of single power law , namely @xmath22 , which is determined by the b / c data .",
    "if the diffusion coefficient @xmath23 permits a flatter behavior at high energies within the allowance of the b / c data , a flatter behavior of @xmath0 could also be expected  @xcite .",
    "if we consider an extra source of antiprotons from the galactic dm annihilation , the fitting to the ams-02 data can be significantly improved .",
    "the data can be well explained by a dm particle with a mass of @xmath24 and an annihilation cross section of @xmath25 into the @xmath26 or @xmath27 final states .",
    "if we assume that there is no obvious excess in the @xmath0 ratio , the ams-02 data can be used to set upper limits on the dm annihilation cross section into @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "we find that the constraints given by the dr-2 model are slightly stricter than those given by the dc model . for small @xmath16 ,",
    "the constraints from ams-02 are even stronger than the constraints from fermi - lat .",
