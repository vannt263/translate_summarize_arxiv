    "if the gas is of secondary origin , produced from icy planetesimals / grains , then the total gas mass is of the same order of magnitude as the co mass .",

    "our extended model gives a fractional luminosity of 4.8@xmath310@xmath44 and dust temperature range between 20 and 100  k. thus , the fundamental properties of the hd  21997 disk are similar to those of other young debris disks .",
    "the primordial gas scenario , however , raises the question whether the dust grains are really secondary , since gas could dampen impact velocities between dust particles , thereby increasing their lifetime in regions where both gas and dust are present .",
    "gas in such a disk is orbiting at sub - keplerian velocities due to a radial pressure gradient .",

    "velocity difference between gas and dust induces grain migration within the disk @xcite .",
    "grains with angular velocities larger / smaller than that of the gas lose / gain angular momentum and drift inward / outward until they are in corotation with the gas .",
    "based on their models , @xcite found that even in gaseous debris disks with gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 , the grains lifetime will be very limited  typically less than 2@xmath310@xmath45yr  because collisions occur between radially drifting grains with unequal sizes . applying these findings for the case of hd  21997 , we conclude that the grains must be replenished and are of secondary origin . the lack of spectral features from small particles in the irs spectrum  unlike in herbig ae and transitional disks where grains are mainly primordial  and the dominance of large grains ( @xmath466 , sect",
    ".  [ modelling ] ) similarly to other debris disks also supports this conclusion .",
    "emission at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths predominantly comes from large grains with size of @xmath47100 . in a gas - free debris disk , such large grains are little affected by radiative forces , thus , they trace the distribution of the parent planetesimals @xcite . in the secondary gas scenario of hd  21997",
    "the models of @xcite predict only weak coupling between gas and grains of @xmath47100 , thus , grain migration is negligible .",
    "this implies a radially broad planetesimal belt in the hd  21997 system . for destructive collisions between planetesimals ,",

    "model @xcite , the formation of @xmath471000  km ",
    "sized planetesimals can initiate a collisional cascade in those disk regions where they appeared .",
    "since the formation of such oligarchs takes longer at larger radii , the site where active dust production occurs is expected to propagate outward .",
    "based on formulae from @xcite , even in a disk with a surface density ten times higher than the minimum - mass solar nebula , the formation of large oligarchs can spread out only to @xmath090  au within 30  myr .",
    "the dust disk ( and the planetesimal belt ) of hd  21997 extends out to @xmath4890au , which can not be explained via self - stirring . in this case",
    ", planetary stirring @xcite may be a viable alternative stirring mechanism to explain the dynamical excitation in the outer regions .",
    "if a large amount of primordial gas is present ( our favored scenario ) , the gas  dust coupling is stronger and it might induce radial migration of grains .",
    "therefore , in the primordial gas scenario , it is possible that hd  21997 has a narrower planetesimal ring , and the extended morphology of the dust is explained by efficient grain migration .",
    "however , the details of grain migration ( e.g. the magnitude of migration ) can not be reliably constrained by the available data , therefore we can not judge the viability of this scenario .",
    "our study indicates that the dust content of the disk is of secondary origin while @xcite claims that the gas component is more likely primordial .",

    "<S> circumstellar disks around stars older than 10  myr are expected to be gas - poor . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , two examples of old ( 3040  myr ) debris - like disks containing a detectable amount of cold co gas . here </S>",
    "<S> we present alma and _ herschel space observatory _ observations of one of these disks , around hd  21997 , and study the distribution and origin of the dust and its connection to the gas . </S>",
    "<S> our alma continuum images at 886   clearly resolve a broad ring of emission within a diameter of @xmath045 , adding hd  21997 to the dozen debris disks resolved at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> modeling the morphology of the alma image with a radiative transfer code suggests inner and outer radii of @xmath055 and @xmath0150  au , and a dust mass of 0.09  m@xmath1 . our data and modeling hints at an extended cold outskirt of the ring . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the morphology of the co gas in the disk reveals an inner dust - free hole where gas nevertheless can be detected . </S>",
    "<S> based on dust grain lifetimes , we propose that the dust content of this gaseous disk is of secondary origin produced by planetesimals . </S>",
    "<S> since the gas component is probably primordial , hd  21997 is one of the first known examples of a hybrid circumstellar disk , a so - far little studied late phase of circumstellar disk evolution . </S>"
