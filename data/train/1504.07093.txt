    "over the last three decades , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite has emerged as a way to ensure the security of a secret key through the very nature of quantum states distributed between trusted parties .",
    "recent developments in this field are concerned with the continuous - variables ( cv ) coding of key bits , @xcite in particular , the gaussian modulation of the field quadratures of squeezed @xcite and coherent states of light @xcite .",
    "coherent state protocols are more promising experimentally @xcite , and the main goal of the present paper is to propose their further simplification . in particular , all published coherent - state protocols suppose a symmetrical amplitude and phase quadrature modulation [ with the exception of the binary zhao - heid - rigas - ltkenhaus 2009 ( zhrl09 ) protocol @xcite however , an asymmetric protocol allows alice to use one modulator ( e.g. an amplitude modulator ) instead of two .",
    "this would reduce the complexity and the cost of alice s apparatus .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude modulator used in a symmetric cv qkd apparatus needs to have a strong extinction ratio , in order to avoid creating a \" hole  in the center of the gaussian probability distribution @xcite . on the other hand , a simple single - quadrature amplitude modulation does not have this need , and the use of more standard ( and cheaper ) modulators becomes possible .",
    "thus , in the present paper we propose the unidimensional ( ud ) cv qkd protocol based on the gaussian single - quadrature modulation of coherent states of light .",
    "we show the security of the protocol in a general phase - sensitive channel restricting eavesdropper only by the physicality constraints and keeping to the pessimistic worst - case assumptions .",
    "then we compare the ud protocol to the standard coherent - state protocol and discuss the possible extensions .",
    "our paper thus continues the tendency of technical simplification of the qkd protocols which was started in @xcite , where the low cost and compact discrete variable qkd system was proposed .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : protocol ] , we present the ud cv qkd protocol , and we analyze its security in sec . [ sec : security ] .",
    "we then look at its performance in the common case of symmetric quantum channels and compare it to the usual symmetric protocol in sec .",
    "[ sec : performance ] .",
    "the central idea of the protocol is to modulate a single quadrature of coherent states , in contrast to the usual coherent - state protocols , where two quadratures are simultaneously modulated .",
    "this should provide simplified implementation , at the price of slightly degraded performances , as we show below .",
    "the scheme of the protocol is given in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "one of the trusted sides , alice , produces coherent states , _",
    "e.g. _ with a laser source .",
    "then she applies modulation in one of the quadratures ( denoted as x ) , using modulator m , and displaces each coherent state according to a random gaussian variable with displacement variance @xmath0 . with no loss of generality we further assume the modulated quadrature @xmath1 to be the amplitude quadrature . in this case",
    "the displacement can be performed by an intensity modulator .",
    "the mixture of the modulated states thus forms a `` sausage '' on a phase - space [ see fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ( a ) ] .",
    "its thickness is the quadrature variance of a coherent state , _",
    "i.e. _ 1 shot noise unit ( snu ) , and its length is @xmath2 snu .",
    "the states are then sent to the remote trusted party bob through a generally phase - sensitive channel with transmittance @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and excess noise @xmath5 , @xmath6 in @xmath1 , and @xmath7 quadrature , respectively .",
    "bob performs a homodyne measurement of the modulated quadrature , using a homodyne detector , measuring most of the time the @xmath1quadrature , and sometimes measuring the @xmath7quadrature .",
    "this basis switching should be performed often enough to gather statistics on the properties of the channel in the @xmath7-quadrature . however , in the asymptotic limit of many repetitions studied here , these measurements can be a vanishing fraction of the total data set and have a negligible impact on the key rate @xcite . after a sufficient number of runs , alice and",
    "bob analyze the security and extract a secret key from the @xmath1-quadrature data using a reverse - reconciliation procedure @xcite .    .",
    "the states travel through an untrusted generally phase - sensitive channel to a remote party bob , who performs homodyne measurement of the modulated quadrature .",
    "( a ) mixture of modulated coherent states on a phase space ( assuming @xmath1 quadrature was modulated ) .",
    "( b ) equivalent entanglement - based scheme using a two - mode squeezed vacuum source , mode a is measured by alice using a homodyne detector , mode b is squeezed on the squeezer s and sent to the channel . [ scheme ] ]    in the following section we estimate the security region of the ud protocol and compare it to the standard coherent - state based protocol .",
    "let us study the protocol in detail and estimate its applicability .",
    "the study of security of cv qkd protocols including finite size effects @xcite and coherent attacks is an ongoing research program@xcite . very recently",
    "@xcite , leverrier has shown for the first time the composable security against general attacks for a cv qkd coherent - state protocol . it was shown that for the symmetrically modulated coherent - state protocol , the optimal attacks are the gaussian attacks and the corresponding secret key rate tends to the one obtained for gaussian collective attacks @xcite for high number of pulses",
    ".    we will compute the asymptotic key rate of our protocol against collective attacks .",
    "an approach similar to @xcite can likely be applied to extend this security to a general attack , but this work is kept for future research .",
    "the extremality of gaussian states @xcite and subsequent optimality of gaussian attacks @xcite allows one to use the powerful covariance matrix formalism to estimate the amounts of information leaking to a potential eavesdropper under given channel conditions .    in the case of collective attacks",
    "the lower bound on the key rate is given by the difference between classical ( shannon ) mutual information , available to the trusted parties ( a and b ) , and the upper bound on the information extractable from the state possessed by an eavesdropper ( e ) and conditioned by the measurement results of the reference side of the classical post processing algorithms , i.e. , in the case of reverse reconciliation the lower bound reads : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the holevo quantity @xcite , being the capacity of a bosonic channel between an eavesdropper ( e ) and the reference side of the information reconciliation ( b ) , quantified as the difference of von neumann entropy @xmath10 of the state , available to an eavesdropper , and the entropy @xmath11 of the eavesdropper state , conditioned by the measurement results of the remote trusted party b @xcite .",
    "the positivity of the lower bound ( [ kr ] ) means that the post - processing algorithms are able to distill the secure key @xcite , i.e. , that the protocol is secure under given channel conditions . in the cases where channel noise is present",
    ", the collective attack can be accessed through the assumption that the eavesdropper holds the purification of the state , shared between a and b , thus the entropies of the sub states of the generally pure state are equal : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the calculation of the von neumann entropies , contributing to the holevo quantity , is done , using the covariance matrix formalism , explicitly describing the gaussian states , through the symplectic eigenvalues @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the respective covariance matrices @xmath16 prior to and @xmath17 after the measurement so that @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xcite is the bosonic entropic function @xcite .      to analyze the security of the protocol we switch to the equivalent entanglement - based ( epr ) scheme @xcite , which allows the explicit description of trusted modes and their correlations . for the ud protocol",
    "such a scheme can be built , by taking a two - mode squeezed vacuum state of variance @xmath20 and squeezing one of its modes with the squeezing parameter @xmath21 , resulting in the covariance matrix : @xmath22 as stated above , the modulated quadrature is the intensity quadrature @xmath1 . if alice performs a homodyne measurement on the mode a , then the coherent state is conditionally prepared and is effectively sent to the remote party bob .",
    "the epr - scheme is then equivalent to the gaussian displacement of coherent states along the @xmath1 quadrature with the variance @xmath23 .",
    "as the states travel through the noisy and lossy channel , the covariance matrix is transformed according to the channel parameters . however , since there is no modulation in the @xmath7 quadrature , the correlation , and , respectively , the channel transmittance in @xmath7 can not be estimated .",
    "the remote party can therefore only measure the variance of the channel output in @xmath7 .",
    "thus , generally , the covariance matrix after the channel in terms of the modulation variance @xmath0 has the form : @xmath24 where @xmath3 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the channel transmittance and excess noise , estimated by the trusted parties through the measurement of the @xmath1 quadrature ; @xmath25 is the output variance of the mode b in the @xmath7 quadrature , which is measured at the remote side , and @xmath26 is the correlation between trusted modes in the @xmath7 quadrature , being unknown due to the fact that the quadrature is not modulated , which means that the channel transmittance is not estimated in @xmath7 .",
    "the covariance matrix of the state , conditioned by bob s measurement in @xmath1 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the submatrices of the covariance matrix @xmath30 ( [ outputstate ] ) , describing the modes a and b individually ; @xmath31 is the submatrix of ( [ outputstate ] ) , which characterizes correlation between modes a and b ; @xmath32 stands for moore penrose ( pseudo- ) inverse of a matrix , and @xmath33 in the general case the conditional matrix is thus given by @xmath34 now let us estimate the lower bound on the key rate ( [ kr ] ) for our single quadrature protocol .",
    "shannon mutual information between the trusted parties is easily calculated from the first diagonal elements of the matrices @xmath28 and @xmath17 : @xmath35    on the other hand , the estimation of the holevo quantity @xmath36 , representing the upper bound on information , available to an eavesdropper , should be done from the whole state and , thus , depends on the unknown correlation parameter @xmath26 . however , this unknown parameter is bounded by the requirement of the physicality of the state , which is given by the heisenberg uncertainty principle , in terms of the covariance matrices being @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the symplectic form @xmath39 this equation imposes physical constraints on the possible values of @xmath26 . such constraint in the general case of noise present in both quadratures",
    "is given by the parabolic equation on the @xmath40 plane : @xmath41 with vertex @xmath42 , defined as : @xmath43 and @xmath44    the first part of the holevo quantity , @xmath45 , can be calculated from the symplectic eigenvalues @xmath14 that are given by the square roots of the solutions of equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the second symplectic invariant , the first one being @xmath48 .",
    "the second part , @xmath49 , is calculated from @xmath50 .",
    "this allows one to analytically derive the lower bound on the key rate and find the security bounds in terms of the unknown correlation @xmath26 upon given ( measured ) @xmath25 .",

    "for comparison the line corresponding to @xmath55 is given as dashed , demonstrating the particular case when security is lost and then restored . [ krvscp ] ]    it is evident from the graph , that there exists a region of @xmath25 , when the protocol is secure for any @xmath26 . in this region",
    "the ud protocol can be indeed implemented without the necessity of the correlation estimation in @xmath7 , since no physically valid collective attack can break the security . for higher values of @xmath25 the protocol",
    "can not be implemented , since it would only be secure for some values of @xmath26 , but alice and bob can not estimate the latter quantity .",
    "such a behavior can be clearly observed at the graphs in fig .",

    "indeed , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ krvscp ] that upon certain values of variance @xmath25 the lower bound on the key rate can have a local minimum within the security region .",
    "moreover , the security can be even lost and restored ( see the dashed line at the inset in fig .",
    "[ krvscp ] ) .    however , when the channel excess noise added in @xmath7-quadrature is small ( i.e. , when @xmath25 is close to 1 ) , the key rate is a monotonously decreasing function of the correlation @xmath57 ( as can be also seen in fig .",
    "[ krvscp ] ) in most of the physicality region , and the pessimistic value for @xmath26 is typically the highest physically valid negative value @xmath58 , which saturates inequality ( [ cpmax ] ) .    as the noise increases , the pessimistic value of @xmath59 gets lower than @xmath58 and must be found numerically .",
    "we thus consider the security region of our protocol as laying along the pessimistic value of @xmath26 ( given as a bold line in fig .",
    "[ cbounds ] ) from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , where physicality and security regions cross . in this case ,",
    "a key rate computed at @xmath58 is greater than the lower bound on the real key rate and is therefore too optimistic .",
    "however , when the pessimistic value of @xmath26 is inside the parabola , the @xmath62 at this point and the pessimistic value is usually close to @xmath58 .",
    "this explains why this upper bound , computed below , is often a good approximation .",
    "the parabola bounding the physicality region corresponds to a state saturating the heisenberg inequality .",
    "therefore , one of the symplectic eigenvalues @xmath63 and @xmath64 and eq",
    ". becomes @xmath65 when @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath67 , i.e. , in the strong - modulation limit , @xmath68 and one can use the expansion of the bosonic function @xmath69 , to derive the following expression for the key rate upper bound : @xmath70     \\lesssim\\tfrac12\\log\\tfrac{\\eta_x}{1 - 2\\eta_x+\\eta_xv_p^b+\\eta_x\\epsilon_x+2\\sqrt{d } }       -\\log\\tfrac e2\\\\+g\\left(\\tfrac12(\\sqrt{\\tfrac1{\\eta_x}+\\epsilon_x}-1)\\right )       + o(\\tfrac1{\\sqrt{\\eta_x}v_m } )     \\end{multlined}\\\\   \\text{with } d&=\\eta_x(1+\\eta_x\\epsilon_x-\\eta_x)(v_p^b(1+\\eta_x\\epsilon_x)-1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 can be replaced by @xmath72 when @xmath58 is indeed the worst @xmath26 .",

    "[ comparison2 ] .",
    "it is evident from the plot that the optimistic assumption of the physicality - bounded @xmath88 gives the same security bounds as the pessimistic one when the channel attenuation goes below few db . in this regime",

    "this intermediate protocol provides the security region , which lays in between the symmetrical and completely asymmetrical counterparts , but requires modulation in both quadratures .",
    "its main interest it theoretical , since it allows one to split the origin of the performance degradation of our protocol compared to gg02 between the degradation due to the asymmetric modulation and the one due to incomplete channel estimation .",
    "another possible option to improve the ud protocol could be the noise addition in @xmath7 to decouple the eavesdropper from the remote trusted party .",
    "however , it widens the physicality region , allowing for the stronger collective attacks , and thus , if the noise is strong enough , security is always broken before the physicality bound , meaning that additional noise in @xmath7 makes the protocol inapplicable .",
    "additionally , if the channel estimation in @xmath7 is performed , then the protocol shows the same performance as the standard squeezed - based protocol @xcite , since the homodyne detection on a projects the two - mode state on the single - mode squeezed state , getting more squeezed as the noise in @xmath7 increases .",
    "further analysis of the protocol will include consideration of reduced post - processing efficiency @xcite , composable security @xcite , and finite - size effects @xcite , which , however , depend on the signal - to - noise ratio and number of samples , rather than the gaussian modulation profile and thus would affect the symmetrical and asymmetrical protocols similarly .",
    "the position of the pessimistic bound for the unmeasured correlation in @xmath7 in particular does not depend on the post - processing efficiency .",
    "we have proposed and investigated the unidimensional continuous - variable quantum key distribution protocol based on the gaussian modulation of a single quadrature of coherent states of light , in which physicality bounds enable to limit the eavesdropping attacks and assess the security region .",
    "the protocol allows simpler technical realization with no need of phase quadrature modulation and full channel estimation at the cost of lower key rate and higher sensitivity to channel excess noise , compared to the symmetrical coherent - state protocol .",
