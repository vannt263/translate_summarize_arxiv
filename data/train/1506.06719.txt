    "energetic charged particles traveling through a crystal can produce x - rays by several mechanisms .",
    "incoherent bremsstrahlung and transition radiation give rise to a continuous spectrum while channeling radiation ( cr ) and parametric x - ray ( pxr ) radiation produce quasi - monochromatic discrete x - ray spectra .",
    "one of the main advantages of using crystals is that cr and pxr produce hard x - rays with much lower energy electrons compared to , for example , synchrotron radiation produced x - rays in circular rings , .",
    "it takes a 3 gev electron beam ( assuming a bend field of 1 t ) to generate x - rays with a critical energy of 10kev via synchrotron radiation while 10 mev electrons have sufficed with channeling and parametric radiation at the same energy .",
    "hard x - ray generation using crystals and 50 mev electrons is one of the planned set of experiments at fermilab s l - band photoinjector in the fast facility ( formerly called asta ) @xcite , currently being commissioned .",
    "the major goal of these experiments is to demonstrate that such a photoinjector with a low emittance electron beam can serve as a model for a brilliant compact x - ray source when scaled to a higher gradient x - band photoinjector .",
    "the detailed characteristics of cr expected at fast was discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will consider the spectral brilliance of pxr under various conditions at fast .",
    "the pxr mechanism was first discussed several decades ago @xcite , experimentally measured first with electrons in 1985 @xcite and since then observed at many laboratories ; several reviews are now available @xcite .",
    "pxr has also been observed from 400 gev protons using a bent crystal at cern s sps accelerator @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of pxr differ from cr in several ways . in cr emission ,",
    "the x - ray energy spectra is discrete at electron energies below 100 mev and the frequencies depend on the particle energy , while in pxr they are independent of particle energy at relativistic particle speeds .",
    "pxr can be generated at large angles from the particle s direction which differentiates it from both cr and bremsstrahlung making the background contribution significantly less than the signal .",
    "the pxr spectral lines are also more monochromatic than cr , the width is at least an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the disadvantage of pxr is that the photon yield is about two to three orders of magnitude smaller than that of cr . on the other hand",
    ", pxr can be generated simultaneously with cr generation thus potentially allowing multiple x - ray beams with different spectra and in different directions .",
    "the crystal requirements for pxr and cr production are similar , namely high thermal conductivity , low photon absorption length , high dielectric susceptibility and large lattice spacing . in this article",
    "we will consider the spectral brilliance from a pxr source under different conditions .",
    "in general , the brilliance will be several orders of magnitude lower than that from the brightest x - ray sources such as xfels or inverse compton scattering .",
    "however , compared to those sources , a pxr source can deliver x - rays suitable for industrial and medical applications with significantly lower cost , complexity and size .",
    "the special feature of the photoinjector at fast for generating brilliant x - rays using crystals is that low emittances can be generated by shaping the laser spot size on the cathode and even lower emittances have been obtained with field emission ( fe ) nanotip cathodes @xcite .",
    "in addition , the photocathode and fe cathodes operate at ghz frequencies , so the high repetition rate allows for low bunch charge required for these low emittances .    in section 2",
    ", we discuss the pxr spectrum , notably the photon energy and the spectral distribution dependence on the crystal geometry . in section 3 ,",
    "we present calculations of the energy width with contributions from geometrical effects and multiple coulomb scattering , while in section 4 we consider angular broadening and in section 5 the spectral brilliance .",
    "section 6 contains specific calculations for the photoinjector at fast ; this includes cases with the use of the present goniometer holding the crystal , the options with a new goniometer , and finally pxr emission under channeling conditions .",
    "we conclude with a summary of results in section 7 .",
    "pxr emission occurs when the virtual photons accompanying the charged particle scatter off the atomic electrons in the crystal and interfere constructively along certain directions .",
    "the incoming virtual photon s wave - vector @xmath0 and the outgoing real photon s wave vector @xmath1 are related by the bragg condition for momentum transfer _ f = * k*_i + m * g * where @xmath2 is the reciprocal lattice vector of the scattering planes and @xmath3 is an integer .",
    "writing @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and taking the scalar product of the above equation with @xmath6 yields the outgoing pxr photon energy as e = = m here @xmath7 is the velocity vector of the particle , @xmath8 is the unit velocity vector . for electron energies in the range of tens of mev , we can approximate @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the unit vector along the direction of the emitted photon and @xmath11 is the real part of the permittivity .",
    "if the first order spectrum is obtained by reflection from a plane with miller indices @xmath12 , multiples of this frequency occur from reflections off planes with indices @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the above equation can also be derived by requiring that the phase difference between photons reflected from adjacent lattice planes be an integer multiple of 2@xmath15 . at x - ray energies , the frequency dependent real part of the dielectric function can be written as @xmath16 the plasma frequency @xmath17 for most crystals is in the range 10 - 90 ev while x rays have kev range energies .",
    "approximating @xmath18 , the first order ( @xmath19 ) pxr energy can be written as e = c c [ eq : ephoton ] where @xmath20 is the angle of the crystal plane with the beam direction , @xmath21 is the angle of the electron with the central electron beam direction , and @xmath22 is the observation angle of the emitted radiation with the beam direction .",

    "the two terms in the numerator of the angular factor describe the contributions from the two polarizations .",
    "if the observation angle @xmath43 , the horizontal contribution vanishes and the observed spectrum is completely vertically polarized at all angles @xmath23 . when projected onto one of the two angles the angular distribution can be either single peaked or double peaked , depending on the value of the orthogonal angle .",
    "the extrema of the angular distribution in @xmath44 are at @xmath45 while those in @xmath46 are at @xmath47 .",

    ", we will primarily consider pxr from this plane .    when beam energies are under 100 mev , the channeling radiation spectrum consists of a few well defined lines and is best understood as arising from transitions between bound states of the transverse potential .",

    "since the spectral brilliance is inversely proportional to the square of the spot size and assuming the emittance is conserved , a larger beam divergence implies a smaller spot size .",
    "the increase in brilliance with the smaller spot size dominates the decrease due to channeling .",
    "one of the primary foreseen uses of pxr is in phase contrast imaging ( pci ) of low z materials , specially biological samples .",
    "there are many pci methods , we plan to use the free space propagation method which does not need any additional optical elements .",
    "the principle of pci is that phase shifts undergone by hard x - rays when traversing low z samples are orders of magnitude larger than absorption effects .",

    "the quality of the image with the free space propagation method depends on the source size , the geometric magnification and the resolution of the detector .",
    "th special feature of fast that makes it suitable for pci is the very low emittance of the electron beam , and hence the small x - ray source size after the crystal . with electron emittances around 100 nm using a conventional photocathode , beam sizes at the crystal around 1 - 5 @xmath154 m",
    "can be achieved @xcite .",
    "this compares very favorably with recent pci experiments using pxr @xcite which had beam sizes of 0.5 - 2 mm ( fwhm ) at the target . with the use of field emitter nanotips as the cathode",
    ", the beam emittance could be improved another order of magnitude @xcite implying a further improvement in image resolution .",
    "the use of the new goniometer , discussed in section [ subsec : newgon ] will enable imaging at multiple x - ray energies .    finally , we mention a proposal @xcite to generate short electron bunches at fast using a slit mask placed in the middle of the bunch compressor chicane .",
    "sub - picosecond electron bunches could be produced without the need of an undulator or an additional complex laser system . due to scattering in the mask",
    ", the final beam intensity will only be about 10% of the initial intensity .",
    "however , starting from initial intensities of 1 - 3 nc , the final bunch intensities within the bunch train will be low enough ( about 20 pc ) for pxr generation .",
    "the resulting sub - picosecond x - ray pulses will have a higher peak brilliance and could be used for time resolved x - ray studies in materials science , chemistry and biology .",
    "in this paper we considered the prospect of generating pxr using diamond crystals with 50 mev electron beams from the photoinjector at the fast facility at fermilab .",
    "we revisited calculations of the energy width from both geometric and multiple scattering .",
    "comparisons with earlier experiments were found to yield reasonable agreement the pxr spectrum model calculation was applied to the conditions at fast . using the presently available",
    "goniometer restricts the bragg angle to 45@xmath155 but allows a clear separation from the electron beam .",
    "the pxr energies from the planes studied fall in the range 4 - 10 kev with a spectral energy widths of @xmath251% . with a diamond crystal thickness of 168@xmath154 m , maximum angular yields",
    "are about 10@xmath252 photons / e@xmath175-sr , taking into account attenuation in air from the crystal to the detector . using crystals of different thicknesses , the pxr yield was found to saturate at a thickness of about 1.2@xmath26 , the photon attenuation length at two different energies .",
    "the spectral brilliance on the other hand attained a maximum value at around 0.2@xmath26 for these same energies .",
    "this is mainly because the emittance growth over larger thicknesses reduces the brilliance more than the yield increases it .",
    "next , pxr emission with a new goniometer with five possible ports was studied .",
    "the range of energies now spans 3 - 18 kev .",
    "the spectral brilliance , around 10@xmath253 photons/(mm - mrad)@xmath254 - 0.1% bw , is reached with a fixed crystal thickness which is less than 0.2@xmath26 for most energies , so higher brilliance is feasible with thicker crystals .",
    "use of this goniometer would open up the possibility of extracting pxr at multiple energies simultaneously .",
    "finally , pxrc or pxr under channeling conditions was studied and the yield with quantum corrections from channeling was calculated for three beam divergences . while the reduction in pxr yield during channeling was smallest for the lowest divergence , higher brilliance favors the smallest beam spot size or equivalently the largest divergence under conditions of equal emittances .",
    "this pxrc emission makes possible simultaneous x - ray emission from channeling and pxr at 90 degrees to each other .",
    "the brilliance of pxr appears to be sufficient for phase contrast imaging and the fast facility with ( 10 - 100 ) nm scale electron emittances should enable imaging with very good resolution .",
