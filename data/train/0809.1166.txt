    "this paper is an overview of the information - geometric description of vapour - liquid phase transitions in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the present section begins with a reasonably self - contained account of the relevant background material on information geometry . as an illustrative example we shall examine in some detail the geometry of the space of gaussian density functions .",
    "the relation between the information measure of fisher and that of shannon and wiener is also briefly discussed . in later sections these ideas",
    "are applied to the information - geometric characterisation of the equilibrium properties of noninteracting and interacting gas molecules .",
    "the relevant references are provided in the bibliographical notes in section  [ sec:4 ] , where we also provide a brief and perhaps incomplete history of information geometry .",
    "the concept of ` information geometry ' is a simple one which emerged from an attempt to discriminate among different probabilities in statistical analysis .",
    "the idea can be sketched as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 denote a set of probabilities satisfying @xmath7 we introduce the following _ square - root map _ : @xmath8 by construction , the square - root probabilities @xmath9 satisfy the normalisation condition @xmath10 if we regard the variables @xmath11 as the coordinates of a vector in an @xmath12-dimensional euclidean space @xmath13 , then the normalisation condition ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) implies that the endpoint of the vector @xmath9 lies on the unit sphere @xmath2 in @xmath13 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath14 corresponds to a second set of square - root probabilities .",
    "then the vector @xmath15 also lies on the unit sphere in @xmath13 .",
    "hence , we can measure the _ relative separation _ or _",
    "overlap _ of two sets of probabilities in terms of the angle @xmath16 between the associated square - root probability vectors .",
    "the angular separation @xmath17 clearly vanishes if @xmath9 and @xmath15 are equal .",
    "conversely , if @xmath9 and @xmath15 are orthogonal then @xmath17 achieves its maximum value @xmath18 .",
    "the angular separation @xmath17 defined in ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) is known as the _ bhattacharyya spherical distance_. note that the cosine square of the spherical distance resembles the transition probability in quantum mechanics modelled on a finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we turn to the notion of so - called _ statistical geometry _ , which arises from the embedding of probability density functions in the hilbert space of square - integrable functions . in probability theory one",
    "typically deals with a probability density function @xmath19 on , say , the real line @xmath20 . for the function @xmath21 to represent the density of some random variable @xmath22 we require that @xmath23 for all @xmath24 and that @xmath25 . if we consider the _ square - root map",
    "@xmath26 then the function @xmath27 defined in this way belongs to the space @xmath28 of square - integrable functions on the real line . in other words , we _ embed _ the density functions in hilbert space via the square - root map ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) . in particular , since the square - root density functions satisfy the normalisation condition @xmath29 the images of the map lie on the unit sphere @xmath30 .",
    "_ bhattacharyya s spherical distance_. two vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 , corresponding to a pair of probability density functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , lie on the surface of the positive orthant of the unit sphere @xmath35 in hilbert space .",
    "the spherical distance between two unit vectors is given by the angle @xmath17 defined in equation ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) . ]",
    "the advantage of working in hilbert space @xmath36 rather than the space of density functions is that @xmath36 is a vector space endowed with various geometric features that are familiar from other branches of physics , such as quantum mechanics or general relativity .",
    "suppose we have a pair of density functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and wish to compare the overlap or separation of these two density functions .",
    "if the associated hilbert space vectors are given respectively by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , then the overlap is measured in terms of the inner product @xmath37 . since @xmath38",
    ", i.e. both vectors have unit norm , this overlap is given by the cosine of the angular separation .",
    "it follows that the bhattacharyya spherical distance between two square - root density functions is @xmath39 this idea is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:1.0 ] .      in theoretical statistics",
    "one typically deals with a parametric family of probability density functions @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 denotes one or more real parameters .",
    "for example , a gaussian density function is characterised by two parameters , i.e. the mean @xmath42 and the variance @xmath43 . for each value , or set of values , of @xmath41 we have the normalisation condition @xmath44 .    in problems of statistical inference ,",
    "it is often convenient to consider the _ log - likelihood function _",
    "@xmath45 however , in physics it is more natural to work with the square - root density function @xmath46 since , as indicated above , this permits formulation of the problem in a real hilbert - space context . as before , for each given @xmath41 the density function is mapped to a point on the unit sphere @xmath47 by the prescription ( [ eq:1.1.9 ] ) .",
    "if the value of @xmath41 is changed , the image under the map in general also varies on @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the density function is at least twice differentiable with respect to the parameters .",
    "then as the parameters change continuously , the image point on @xmath2 will vary smoothly over a parametric subspace @xmath4 of the sphere @xmath2 .",
    "given a parametric subspace @xmath48 the metric of the ambient sphere @xmath2 induces a riemannian metric on the subspace in the usual way .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "recall that the hilbert space inner product is defined by @xmath49 therefore , if we set @xmath50 where @xmath51 , then the squared distance @xmath52 of the difference vector @xmath53 is given by @xmath54    before we proceed further with the derivation of the metric , let us introduce the statistical notion of the _ fisher information matrix _ , which is usually defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the log - likelihood density ( [ eq:1.1.8 ] ) .",
    "the fisher information matrix is important in statistics because it provides a lower bound for the variance of a parameter estimate.consider , for example , the case of a one - parameter family of density functions . that is",
    ", we have a density function @xmath57 that depends upon a single unknown parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the objective is thus to estimate the parameter by performing observations . if @xmath58 is an unbiased estimator for @xmath41 , i.e. if the expectation of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath57 yields @xmath41 , then we have @xmath59 differentiating with respect to @xmath41 we obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 . by the schwarz inequality @xmath62",
    "we thus find @xmath63 note that the left side is the variance of the estimator , whereas the denominator of the right side is the one - parameter form of the fisher information matrix .",
    "the relation ( [ eq:1.15 ] ) provides a lower bound for the variance , and is known as the _ cramr - rao inequality_. the inequality in ( [ eq:1.16a ] ) is attained only when the two vectors are proportional , that is , @xmath64 for some constant @xmath65 . by scaling @xmath41 we can set @xmath66 without loss of generality .",
    "hence , the lower bound of the variance is attained only if the square - root density assumes an exponential form : @xmath67 the exponential family ( [ eq:1.18 ] ) plays an important role in the applications to statistical mechanics considered below .    in a multi - parameter context",
    "the reciprocal of the fisher information matrix determines lower bounds for the variance in an analogous manner . from the geometrical viewpoint ,",
    "the significance of the fisher information matrix is that it defines the induced riemannian metric on the parametric subspace @xmath4 of the unit sphere @xmath2 in @xmath36 .",
    "specifically , comparing ( [ eq:1.12 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.13 ] ) we see that @xmath68 the metric @xmath69 on @xmath4 will be referred to as the _ fisher - rao metric_. the factor of a quarter is purely a matter of convention , and the fisher - rao metric is thus given by a quarter of the fisher information matrix .",
    "we introduce here some elementary concepts in riemannian geometry that are relevant to the ensuring discussion .",
    "we note first that all equilibrium distributions that we consider here are represented in the exponential form @xmath70 where @xmath71 are parameters , @xmath72 represents the prescribed equilibrium state at @xmath73 for all @xmath74 , and the functions @xmath75 determine the form of the energy . in other words , we shall only consider equilibrium states represented in the _ canonical _ form .",
    "the parameters @xmath76 may include inverse temperature , chemical potential , pressure , magnetic field , and so on , whereas the functions @xmath77 may represent system energy , particle number , system volume , magnetisation , and so on .",
    "the variable @xmath78 ranges over the phase space @xmath79 of the system .",
    "the function @xmath80 determines the overall normalisation .",
    "we refer to @xmath81 as the _ thermodynamic potential _ of the system .",
    "it should be evident by inspection that @xmath82 in other words , the first derivative of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath83 determines the expectation value of @xmath77 in the equilibrium state ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) . as we shall indicate below",
    ", analogous calculations show that higher derivatives of the thermodynamic potential @xmath81 determine higher moments of the functions @xmath84 .",
    "if the equilibrium density function assumes the form ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) , then the expressions for the corresponding fisher - rao metric and the coefficients of the associated metric connection on the statistical manifold @xmath4 are simplified .",
    "let us state the results first .    for a density function of the exponential form ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) the fisher - rao metric @xmath85 and the christoffel symbols",

    "geodesic equations do not generally admit elementary analytic solutions , although in some cases one can solve ( [ eq:1.31 ] ) in closed form , as in the gaussian example discussed below .",
    "_ proof of proposition  [ prop:1]_. from ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) we have @xmath102 on the other hand , differentiating the normalisation condition @xmath103 once with respect to @xmath83 and using @xmath104 we obtain @xmath105 whence it follows that the expectation of @xmath77 with respect to @xmath57 is given by @xmath106 , as shown in ( [ eq:3.2b ] ) .",
    "differentiating ( [ eq:3.6 ] ) with respect to @xmath107 , we find that @xmath108 in view of ( [ eq:1.32 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.13 ] ) , this implies that the fisher - rao metric @xmath85 is given by ( [ eq:1.23 ] ) . from ( [ eq:1.30 ] )",
    "we have @xmath109 but since the metric is given by ( [ eq:1.23 ] ) we immediately deduce the expression ( [ eq:1.24 ] ) for the christoffel symbols .",
    "@xmath110    it is important to note that if we choose an alternative parametrisation for @xmath4 , then the components of the metric tensor and the christoffel symbol can not be calculated using the simple expressions given in proposition  [ prop:1 ] , and we must use the defining equations ( [ eq:1.13 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.30 ] ) to determine these quantities .",
    "also note that the metric tensor is the covariance matrix of the functions @xmath84 , whereas the components of @xmath111 are third - order cross - moments of @xmath84 .    in terms of the christoffel symbols",

    "this is because the metric of such a space satisfies the vacuum einstein equation @xmath133 where @xmath134 .",
    "the significance of the einstein equation in statistics or statistical mechanics can be seen if we relax the normalisation condition on the square - root density function @xmath27 and thus eliminate the physically irrelevant degree of freedom associated with the norm @xmath135 .",
    "specifically , if @xmath58 represents an observable function on the phase space @xmath79 then its expectation value in the generic ` state ' @xmath27 is @xmath136 evidently , the expectation so defined is invariant under the scale transformation @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is an arbitrary nonzero number .",
    "thus , all the relevant statistical information is encoded in the direction of the vector @xmath139 , irrespective of its length . via the identification",
    "@xmath140 we obtain a space of rays in @xmath141 , which is known as the real projective hilbert space .",
    "suppose now that we consider the einstein equation ( [ eq:1.401 ] ) for the metric on the projective hilbert space .",

    "specifically , this is obtained by setting @xmath142 and @xmath143 in @xmath144 taylor expanding each side , and retaining terms of quadratic order . then with the notation of ( [ eq:1.11 ] ) we can write @xmath145 which defines a metric on the projective hilbert space .",
    "it follows that the einstein equation uniquely determines the probabilistic properties of the space of densities .    for a statistical manifold",
    "@xmath4 associated with a distribution of the exponential type ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) , the riemann tensor assumes a simple form because the first two terms in ( [ eq:3.8 ] ) cancel , and only the contractions of the christoffel symbols remain .",
    "the examples of statistical mechanical systems considered here are parameterised by a pair of external variables , so that the statistical manifold @xmath4 is two - dimensional . in this case , the expression for the scalar curvature admits further simplifications .",

    "mahalanobis was a physicist and statistician who taught relativity and wrote an introduction to the translation by m.  saha of minkowski s work on relativity .",
    "his articles on relativity , written jointly with s.  n.  bose were published by the calcutta university .",
    "he introduced a measure of mutual separation in the study of statistical data arising from anthropometric measurements .",
    "an alternative measure of separation was subsequently introduced by bhattacharyya ( 1943 , 1946 ) , and was defined in section  [ sec:1 ] as the bhattacharyya spherical distance between two probability densities .",
    "the geometric description of the parameter - space manifold was initiated at around the same time by rao ( 1945 , 1947 , 1954 ) .",
    "the seminal paper by rao ( 1945 ) is significant in two respects : on the one hand , it introduced the so - called cramr - rao inequality as a lower bound for the variance , while on the other hand it pointed out that the information measure introduced previously by fisher ( 1925 ) defines a riemannian metric on the parameter - space manifold of a statistical model .",
    "rao then proposed the associated geodesic distance as a measure of dissimilarity between probability distributions .",
    "the formulation considered by rao was based on the hilbert space embedding @xmath456 . as a consequence , many of the constructions in rao ( 1945 ) bear a formal resemblance to the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics , developed by physicists some time later in the 1980 s and 1990 s .",
    "concurrently with rao s work on the application of geometry in statistics , jeffreys ( 1946 ) also introduced the concept of uninformative priors based on the use of a riemannian metric .",
    "it is worth noting incidentally that the inner product of probability measures via the square - root embedding was introduced earlier by hellinger ( 1909 ) in connection with unitary invariants of self - adjoint operators in hilbert space .",
    "the distance measure of hellinger was subsequently extended by von neumann and kakutani ( see kakutani 1946 ) , who introduced an inner product of probability measures in an abstract measure - theoretic context and applied this to investigate equivalence and orthogonality relations between product measures .",
    "the kakutani inner product was used by brody ( 1971 ) to provide a simple proof of the gaussian dichotomy theorem , and has also been extended by bures ( 1969 ) in the context of operator algebras .",
    "interest in the application of geometrical techniques to statistical inference appear to have somewhat diminished subsequently , but reemerged with the appearance of efron s seminal paper ( 1975 ) on information loss and statistical curvature .",
    "efron considered the logarithmic embedding @xmath457 and demonstrated that in the space of log - likelihood density functions the curvature of the curve @xmath458 measures the deviation of the density function from the exponential family .",
    "furthermore , the squared statistical curvature was shown to determine the loss of information resulting from the use of the maximum likelihood estimator for the unknown parameter @xmath41 .    the work of efron ( 1975 , 1978)and to some extent that of encov ( 1982 ) who showed that the fisher information metric is unique under certain assumptions including invariance  evoked considerable interest in the geometrical approach to asymptotic inference and related topics in statistics . numerous research papers ( for example , atkinson & mitchell 1981 ) , as well as review papers ( for example , kass 1989 ) and monographs ( for example , amari 1985 , amari _",
    "et al_. 1987 , murray & rice 1993 , and amari & nagaoka 2000 ) , were subsequently published .    in parallel with these developments in statistics ,",
    "the application of information geometry to the description of the equilibrium properties of thermodynamic systems was considered by a number of authors .",
    "one of the initiators was ingarden ( 1981 ) , who considered various banach space embeddings of probability density functions and their relation to the concepts of entropy and fisher information , and suggested their application to statistical physics .",
    "the works of ingarden and his collaborators led to the establishment of a polish school of researchers systematically investigating various geometric aspects of physical systems described by equilibrium distributions .",
    "janyszek & mrugaa ( 1989a ) , for instance , clarified the relation of the fisher - rao geometry to contact geometry ( the latter characterises the geometry of legendre transformations ) , and investigated the physical interpretation of the metric tensor for a system of gas molecules characterised by the pressure - temperature distribution .",
    "janyszek & mrugaa ( 1989b ) calculated the scalar curvatures of the parameter space manifolds of the one - dimensional ising model in the thermodynamic limit and of the mean - field model .",
    "janyszek & mrugaa ( 1990 ) also extended information geometric analysis to the investigation of the stability of ideal quantum gases .",
    "some of these ideas were further extended by others in the context of various spin models in statistical mechanics ( see , for example , janke _",
    "et al_. 2002 , brody & ritz 2003 , johnston _ et al_. 2003 ) .",
    "an independent line of investigation on the various geometric properties of thermodynamic state spaces was initiated by weinhold ( 1975 ) and also by ruppeiner ( 1979 ) .",
    "weinhold proposed the existence of a metric structure for the thermodynamic state space arising from empirical laws of thermodynamics .",
    "this line of thinking , which led to the notion of the so - called _ thermodynamic length _ , was extended in a variety of ways by various authors ( see , for example , salamon & berry 1983 , schlgl 1985 , mrugaa _ et al_. 1990 ) .",
    "ruppeiner went a step further and considered the second derivative of the entropy , discussed briefly here in section  [ sec:1.5 ] , as a riemannian metric on the thermodynamic state space .",
    "the metric considered by ruppeiner , based upon the shannon - wiener entropy , agrees with rao s entropy derivative metric ( cf .",
    "rao 1984 ) , and is also related to the fisher - rao metric through a legendre transformation .",
    "the key idea is that the convexity of entropy implies the positive - definiteness of the associated hessian matrix , which can therefore be used to define a riemannian metric on the thermodynamic state space .",
    "the simplest system to consider in this respect is naturally that of a noninteracting gas of classical particles .",
    "this was investigated by ruppeiner ( 1979 ) , and also by mijatovi _ et al_. ( 1987 ) .",
    "geometric aspects of various other physical systems have also been investigated along these lines ( ruppeiner 1990 , 1991 ) . for a comprehensive bibliography on this topic ,",
    "see the reference list in the review article by ruppeiner ( 1995 ) .",
    "ingarden & tamassy ( 1993 ) also applied an entropic measure of divergence to explain the thermodynamic arrow of time .",
    "while the infinitesimal form of the entropic measure of divergence ( relative entropy ) gives rise to a riemannian structure characterised in general by the burbea - rao metric ( [ eq:1.85 ] ) , the metrics arising from entropies generally possess finslerian structure .",
    "in particular , the finsler metric arising from relative entropy is not symmetric .",
    "the idea of ingarden & tamassy ( 1993 ) consists in exploiting the lack of symmetry in such metrics to explain the thermodynamic arrow of time , without the introduction of dissipation .",
    "an important application of information geometry to the properties of renormalisation group flow in statistical physics  motivated in part by the observation of dawid ( 1975 ) that efron s results might be represented more concisely in terms of hilbert space geometry  was proposed by brody ( 1987 ) .",
    "closely related ideas were developed further by oconnor & stephens ( 1993 ) , dolan ( 1998 ) , brody & ritz ( 1998 ) , and brody ( 2000 ) .",
    "( see also disi _",
    "et al_. ( 1984 ) for an alternative approach to analysis of renormalisation group flow using rao s entropy derivative metric . )",
    "the ideas of information geometry have also been extended to the quantum domain by replacing the density functions of classical probability theory by density matrices .",
    "substantial work has been done on quantum information geometry ( for example , petz & sudar 1996 , uhlmann 1996 , grasselli & streater 2001 , petz 2002 , streater 2004 , jenov & petz 2006 , gibilisco & isola 2007 , and gibilisco _ et al_. 2007 ) , as well as its application to quantum statistical inference ( brody & hughston 1998 , barndorff - nielsen & gill 2000 ) .    turning more specifically to the subject matter of the present review , as indicated above , the spherical distance ( [ eq:1.7 ] ) representing the dissimilarity of probability densities",
    "was introduced by bhattacharyya ( 1943 ) , and the concept of a statistical manifold represented by the metric ( [ eq:1.23 ] ) was introduced by rao ( 1945 ) .",
    "the uniqueness of the einstein metric on a complex projective space was conjectured by calabi , and later proven by yau ( 1977 ) .",
    "the implication of this result in quantum mechanics  that the solution to the vacuum einstein equation in the space of pure quantum states determines transition probabilities  was pointed out to the first author by g.  w.  gibbons in the late 1990 s .",
    "the relevance of the projective space and the associated metric ( [ eq:1.47 ] ) to statistical mechanics was demonstrated by brody & hughston ( 1999 ) .",
    "the expression in proposition  [ prop:2 ] for the scalar curvature in terms of the determinant of a @xmath459 matrix , valid for the two - dimensional statistical manifold associated with a canonical density function , is given in janyszek & mrugaa ( 1989b ) .",
    "the fact that the statistical manifold associated with the normal density function possesses constant negative curvature , shown in equation ( [ eq:1.57 ] ) , was observed by amari ( 1982 ) .",
    "however , the significance of the scalar curvature ( or in fact the riemann tensor itself ) in statistical analysis remains somewhat obscure .",
    "a survey article by burbea ( 1986 ) deals systematically with expressions for geodesic curves associated with a number of standard density functions used in statistics ( see also the article by rao in amari _ et al_. 1987 ) .",
    "this includes , in particular , the distance between gaussian density functions as given in ( [ eq:1.69 ] ) and ( [ eq:1.71 ] ) .",
    "analogous results for gamma - distributed densities have been calculated in some detail by burbea _ et al_. ( 2002 ) .",
    "the fact that the leading order term in the taylor expansion of the relative entropy of a neighbouring pair of parametric density functions gives rise to the fisher - rao metric was observed by ingarden ( 1981 ) .",
    "a more detailed and thorough analysis was given by burbea & rao ( 1984 ) , and constitutes the basis for the discussion in section  [ sec:1.5 ] .",
    "the specific form of entropy defined in ( [ eq:1.80 ] ) , sometimes referred to as the @xmath237-order entropy , was introduced by havrad & charvt ( 1967 ) in the context of quantifying classification schemes .",
    "see also burbea & rao ( 1982a , 1982b ) for details concerning various properties of this entropy .",
    "the use of the @xmath237-order entropy in statistical mechanics has been proposed by tsallis ( 1988 ) .    in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we considered the information geometry of the pressure - temperature distribution representing the equilibrium state of a gas of noninteracting particles ( classical ideal gas ) .",
    "the flatness of the information manifold of a classical ideal gas was pointed out by ruppeiner ( 1979 ) using the entropy derivative metric .",
    "the solution to the associated geodesic equations , in the form expressed in proposition  [ prop:5 ] , does not seem to appear elsewhere .",
    "( an alternative representation of the geodesics appears in mijatovi _",
    "et al_. 1987 . )    in sections  [ sec:3.1]@xmath460[sec:3.4 ] we have provided a brief account of the classical theory of the van der waals gas , as a background for the subsequent geometric description .",
    "our exposition follows closely the classic treatise of mayer & mayer ( 1940 ) .",
    "there is a series of inspiring papers by kac _ et al_. ( 1963 ) , uhlenbeck _",
    "et al_. ( 1963 ) , hemmer _",
    "et al_. ( 1964 ) , and also hemmer ( 1964 ) , analysing the vapour - liquid equilibrium of the van der waals gas in great detail .",
    "these papers extend the earlier work of kac ( 1959 ) , which provides a method for determining the partition function of interacting gas molecules .",
    "other related work on systems of interacting gas molecules includes the following : tonks ( 1936 ) determined the equations of state for gases composed of hard elastic spheres with finite radius .",
    "van hove ( 1950 ) calculated the free energy of a system of molecules with nonvanishing incompressible radii , interacting according to a finite range force .",
    "he showed that in one dimension the system exhibits no phase transition .",
    "lebowitz & percus ( 1963 ) studied the properties of the correlation functions .",
    "van kampen ( 1964 ) showed that a gas of molecules with hard sphere repulsive forces and long - range attractive interactions exhibits condensation , and calculated the density fluctuations .",
    "rigourous bounds for the free energy of the van der waals gas were derived by lebowitz & penrose ( 1966 ) .",
    "detailed analyses of the curvature of some of these classical systems of interacting molecules were presented by ruppeiner & chance ( 1990 ) .",
    "the geometry of the van der waals gas associated with the entropy derivative metric is considered in papers by disi & lukcs ( 1986 ) and in disi _",
    "et al_. ( 1989 ) , wherein the authors determine the scalar curvature using the density and temperature as coordinates . using these coordinates",
    ", they have also shown that on this statistical manifold there exists no solution to the killing equations ( i.e. no vector field such that the associated flow preserves geodesic distances ) .",
    "the description of the geometry of the van der waals manifold presented in section  [ sec:3.5 ] follows closely the analysis outlined by janyszek ( 1990 ) and also by brody & rivier ( 1995 ) . in particular , the expressions for the metric tensor in proposition  [ prop:7 ] and for the scalar curvature in proposition  [ prop:8 ] were derived by brody & rivier ( 1995 ) , who also suggested that the curvature of the statistical manifold might play a role in statistical mechanics analogous to that of geometric phases in quantum mechanics .",
    "this remains an open issue , although recent work on quantum phase transitions indicate that there is indeed a close analogy between these two concepts .",
