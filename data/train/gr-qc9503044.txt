    "the decay time scale for non - superconducting matter computed by the above authors is @xmath227 yr for @xmath228 and @xmath229 yr for @xmath230 .",
    "according to our study , the influence of the magnetic field on the star s structure is mostly due to lorentz forces and not to the gravitational field generated by the electromagnetic stress - energy .",
    "this may be understood once it has been realized that a magnetic field of @xmath231 has an energy density of @xmath232 , whereas the matter density at the centre of neutron stars is between @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "although the electromagnetic energy is much lower than the fluid mass - energy , the deformation of the star can be as dramatic as that of fig .",
    "[ f : static , isoener , mmax ] because of the _ anisotropic _ character of the magnetic pressure , just as the anisotropic centrifugal forces can highly deform the star in the rotating case though the kinetic energy is much lower than the fluid rest mass .    in static and slowly rotating cases ,",
    "lorentz forces stretch the star away from the symmetry axis .",
    "the deformation is appreciable only for @xmath235 . in highly relativistic situations ( supramassive sequences ) ,",
    "the effect of the magnetic field is instead to reduce the star s equatorial radius ( at fixed baryon number ) .",
    "the maximum poloidal magnetic field supported by neutron stars has a polar value between @xmath236 and @xmath237 depending upon the eos and the rotation state of the star .",
    "let us recall that the magnetic field at the star s centre is two to four times higher than at the poles .",
    "the impact of the magnetic field on the maximum mass of neutron stars is very limited for magnetic fields of the order of 1 gt , whereas it is important for the magnetic fields near the maximum value ( @xmath238 ) : in the static case , @xmath147 is increased by @xmath239 to @xmath4  depending upon the eos  with respect to non - magnetized configurations .",
    "in fact , the magnetic field reveals to be more efficient in increasing @xmath147 than the rotation , except for the eos hkp , where the maximum mass in rotation ( without any magnetic field ) is @xmath240 higher than @xmath147 for stationary configurations ( salgado et al .",
    "1994a ) , whereas the static magnetized @xmath147 is only @xmath156 higher . for the pandn eos ,",
    "the @xmath147 increase by both mecanisms are similar ( @xmath241 ) , whereas for the pol2 , bji and diaz ii eos , the static magnetized @xmath147 lies above the rotating non - magnetized @xmath147 .    in the future",
    ", we plan to study the stability of the magnetized configurations presented in this article .",
    "two types of instabilities may be expected to occur for high values of @xmath0 : ( i ) a pure electromagnetic instability towards another electric current - magnetic field distribution ( of lower energy ) and ( ii ) a non - axisymmetric instability resulting in a triaxial stellar equilibirum shape , which would be the magnetic analog of the transition from the maclaurin spheroids to the tri - axial jacobi ellipsoids for high rotational velocities of newtonian incompressible bodies .",
    "we thank pawel haensel for his careful reading of the manuscript and many remarks about the physics of the magnetic field in neutron star interiors .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for useful comments that helped us to improve the paper .",
