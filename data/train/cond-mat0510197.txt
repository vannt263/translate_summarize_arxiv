    "carbon nanotubes are indubitably among of the most interesting materials discovered in the past years@xcite . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", their quasi one - dimensional character imposes quite exotic electronic properties .",
    "in fact , some time ago it was proposed that carbon nanotubes might be good candidates for the elusive luttinger liquids@xcite . from a more practical point of view ,",
    "carbon nanotubes turned out to be extraordinary materials , as they possess remarkable mechanical and electronic properties .",
    "this makes them probable building blocks for future high - stiffness materials and molecular nanodevices@xcite .",
    "the electronic properties of single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnt ) can be tuned by varying the two integers @xmath3 which determine the chirality of the tube .",
    "for instance nanotubes are either metallic ( for @xmath4 ) or semiconducting . in the latter case ,",
    "the band gap can range from more than 1ev [ e.g. , 1.31ev for the ( 4,3 ) tube@xcite ] to nearly zero [ e.g. , for tubes with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 labels the `` family '' to which the swcnt belongs ]",
    ".    among various experimental techniques that can be used to study and characterize materials , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) stands out as being particularly suited to study local electronic structures@xcite .",
    "nmr is widely used in structural chemistry and in material science .",
    "it measures the local magnetic fields on the nuclei generated by the response of the electrons to an external uniform magnetic field . in nonmagnetic insulators",
    "this response ( the chemical shift ) is determined by the orbital motion of the electrons , and provides information about the local atomic environment ( coordination and geometry ) around each nucleus .    in spite of the usefullness of the technique ,",
    "only a few groups have up to now used nmr to study carbon nanotubes .",
    "the reason is that these experiments are quite difficult to perform , due to the presence of magnetic impurities ( like rh , pt , ni , etc . ) in the samples",
    ". these impurities , which are added as a catalyst during the production of the nanotubes , lead to very broad magic - spinning angle ( mas ) spectra , with widths of about 3050ppm@xcite .",
    "however , we expect this situation to change soon , due to new production techniques that use water@xcite or alcohol@xcite to enhance the activity and the lifetime of the catalysts . in this way , it is possible to produce samples with a swcnt / catalyst weight ratio 100 times higher than previous techniques@xcite , which will clearly allow the measurement of nmr spectra to unprecedented accuracy .",
    "another possible approach involves the removal of the ferromagnetic impurities in solution .",
    "this very promising path has been used recently to study the nmr response of functionalized ( soluble ) nanotubes@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a _ ab initio _ study of the magnetic response properties of _ infinite _ carbon nanotubes .",
    "in particular , we provide benchmark calculations of the magnetic susceptibility and nmr @xmath0c chemical shift of semiconducting swcnt , both isolated and in bundles .",
    "furthermore , we present results for double - wall tubes .",
    "we use the recently proposed gauge - including projector augmented - wave ( gipaw ) approach for the calculation of nmr response in periodic systems@xcite .",
    "this approach is based on a linear response formulation of density functional theory ( dft ) , as implemented in the plane - wave pseudo - potential code paratec@xcite .",
    "contributions to the nmr spectra from the core regions are taken into account using the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) electronic structure method@xcite .",
    "we would like to remark that the current implementation of the gipaw method only allows the study of semiconducting systems .",
    "the extension to metals is currently on the way , and first results are expected shortly .",
    "we restrict our study to @xmath7 ( zigzag ) nanotubes , belonging to the two families characterized by @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , 13 , 16 , 19 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , 11 , 14 , 17 , 20 ) . for each of these families ,",
    "the band gap decreases as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the diameter of the tube .",
    "( note that zigzag tubes have a relatively small number of atoms in the unit cell , which eases the computational burden . ) in all calculations , wave - functions were expanded in plane - waves with a cutoff of 40ry , and we used the pbe generalized gradient approximation to the exchange and correlation functional of dft . for carbon , we used a norm conserving troullier - martins@xcite pseudo - potential with a core radius of 1.75a.u .",
    "the gipaw reconstruction included two projectors per angular momentum for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 electrons .",
    "the `` isolated '' tubes were rolled from a graphene sheet with @xmath16  and were set in a tetragonal super - lattice , with a minimum separation of 5.5  between neighboring tubes . for the smaller tubes a sampling of 20 k - points in the periodic dimension proved sufficient to converge our results to better than 0.25ppm , while larger tubes required 40 k - points at most .",
    "we modeled bundles by arranging nanotubes on a hexagonal lattice , with an inter - tube spacing of 3.3 . in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the tube axis , we used a @xmath17 sampling of the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "overall , we believe that our numerical procedure yields magnetic susceptibilities to a couple of percent and isotropic shifts with a precision better than 1ppm .    when calculating the chemical shift tensor , special care has to be taken with its macroscopic component @xmath18 .",
    "this is not a bulk quantity , and its value depends on the shape of the macroscopic sample . for example , for a spherical or cylindrical sample , and for a susceptibility tensor diagonal in the cartesian axis , this quantity can be related to the volumetric macroscopic susceptibility @xmath19 through the relation ( in cgs units ) @xmath20 where @xmath2 is a diagonal matrix with values @xmath21 for a sphere and @xmath22 and @xmath23 for a cylinder ( in this latter case @xmath24 denotes the direction of the axis of the cylinder ) . in the case of a bundle of nanotubes , we believe that the most correct choice is the cylinder . for the isolated tubes the volumetric macroscopic susceptibility decays as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the distance between the centers of two adjacent tubes .",
    "we are therefore free to choose the matrix @xmath2 in order to speed up the convergence of the chemical shift with @xmath26 .",
    "we found empirically that the choice @xmath22 and @xmath27 provided a faster convergence rate than either the sphere or the cylinder .",
    "experimental results for the chemical shift are usually given relatively to the isotropic shift of tetramethylsilane ( tms ) .",
    "the reference tms shielding tensor @xmath28 is usually calculated within the same numerical framework used for the systems under study .",
    "this is , e.g. , the method used in ref .  .",
    "in this work , we follow a slightly different approach . within our gipaw method",
    "we calculate the @xmath0c shielding tensor of benzene , and use the formula @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the _ calculated _ shielding tensor of the tube and @xmath31 is the average value of the diagonal of the _ calculated _ shielding tensor of benzene .",
    "finally , @xmath32 is the _ experimental _ isotropic chemical shift in the gas - phase of benzene relative to tms . as the magnetic response of the tubes is very similar to the response of benzene",
    ", we expect in this way to minimize the systematic errors in our calculations .",
    "the experimental @xmath32 was taken to be 126.9ppm@xcite , while @xmath33 calculated at the equilibrium geometry was 40.0ppm .",

    "it was found that @xmath39 increases linearly with the nanotube diameter .",
    "furthermore , for an applied magnetic field parallel to the tube axis , the response @xmath41 was paramagnetic for tubes with @xmath42 , while for tubes with @xmath43 or 2 the response was diamagnetic .",

    "finally , it was found that the response of the tubes with @xmath43 and @xmath10 was almost identical .",
    "the experimental situation is somehow more complicated , as the experimental samples normally contain a mixture of tubes of different chiralities , including both metallic and semiconducting tubes .",
    "however , a recent experiment@xcite estimated the magnitude of the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy @xmath44 to be @xmath45cgs / mol for 1 nm diameter semiconducting tubes , similar to the predicted values of @xmath46cgs / mol ( ref .  ) and @xmath47cgs / mol ( ref .  ) .    in fig .",

    "for @xmath50 the situation is reversed : this quantity is almost independent of @xmath49 for @xmath43 , and its absolute value decreases monotonically for @xmath10 .",
    "note that , if we extrapolate our results to @xmath51 , we find values quite consistent with ref .  .",

    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the isotropic peak is fairly large , being around 50ppm@xcite or 30ppm@xcite .",
    "this width was interpreted as a distribution of isotropic lines , resulting in part from the presence of both semiconducting and metallic tubes in the sample .",
    "the static spectra are quite broad , spawning more than 200ppm .",
    "it was also noted that the presence of residual ni and co magnetic particles can contribute to the further broadening of the spectra .",
    "the principal values of the chemical shift tensor can be obtained from the nmr spectra through a fitting procedure . in this way ,",
    "ref .   found @xmath62ppm , @xmath63ppm , and @xmath64ppm ( which leads to @xmath65ppm and @xmath66 ) , while in ref .",

    "the large difference between the two experiments ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : static ] ) can be understood from the difficulty of obtaining good samples .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the first attempt at describing the nmr response of carbon nanotubes@xcite was performed within a tight - binding scheme and using the london approximation ( i.e. , retaining only the london ring - current contribution to the chemical shift and neglecting the pople correction@xcite ) . to justify this approximation",
    "it was argued that the pople contribution gave rise to a global shift , independent of chirality , that could not be used to distinguish between different tubes .",
    "within this framework , it was estimated that the difference in the isotopic chemical shift between metallic and semiconducting tubes amounted to 12ppm .",
    "( absolute shifts were not given due to the neglection of the pople correction . )",
    "furthermore , it was found that the nmr of both metallic and semiconducting is mostly insensitive to diameter and chirality .",
    "more recently the @xmath0c chemical shift of finite - size ( 9,0 ) single wall carbon nanotubes was investigated@xcite .",
    "the tube fragments studied were capped by either c@xmath72 or hydrogen . for the longest fragment",
    "it was found @xmath73ppm for carbon atoms at the center of tube , in reasonably good agreement with experimental data . for the c@xmath72-capped tubes , apparently the best models for the infinite systems , the shifts in the middle of the fragment were invariably smaller than those at the end ( where they reached @xmath74ppm ) .",
    "our results for the isolated tubes are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra1 ] .",
    "the two families can be clearly identified : the family with @xmath43 has a slightly larger chemical shift than the family with @xmath10 .",
    "the results can be fitted by the relation @xmath75 where @xmath13 is the diameter of the nanotube in nanometers , and @xmath76 is the isotropic chemical shift relative to tms in ppm . according to this formula",
    ", in the limit of infinite radius the isotropic chemical shift tends to 116.0ppm .",
    "this value compares reasonably well with the estimate of 128ppm for @xmath77 of a perfect graphene layer ( with zero density of states at the fermi level)@xcite . for a nanotube with a diameter of 1.2 nm , like the ones common in experimental samples , we obtain a @xmath78ppm , in excellent agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "note that , as already indicated in refs .   and  , the nmr chemical shift depends very weakly on the diameter and on the chirality of the semiconducting nanotubes : the isotropic shifts of the zigzag tubes studied in this work lie between 122ppm for the smallest tube [ the @xmath79 to 132ppm for the @xmath80 tube .",
    "the isotropic shifts of the bundles are represented by red crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra2 ] . since the hexagonal lattice breaks the chiral symmetry of the tubes , the carbon atoms around the circumference of the tube are no longer equivalent , resulting in a slight spread of @xmath81 in the unit cell . for the nanotubes studied here , this spread of the isotropic shift was quite small ( around 3ppm ) , and fairly independent of the radius of the tube .",
    "it can also be seen that the average shift in a bundle is nearly equal to the isotropic value of the isolated tube@xcite .",
    "we are now in condition to discuss the large width mas spectra , that amounts to 3050ppm .",
    "several effects can contribute to this width :    ( i )  experimental samples are composed of nanotubes of different diameters and chiralities .",
    "assuming that the spread of diameters is around 0.5 nm , and the distribution is centered around 1.2 nm , from fig  [ fig : spectra1 ] we obtain a spread of around 4ppm .",
    "furthermore , the difference in chemical shift between semiconducting and metallic tubes was estimate to be 12ppm@xcite .",
    "( ii )  as experiments are usually performed with samples of swcnts arranged in bundles , we have to take into account the spread of isotropic chemical shifts due to the breaking of chiral symmetry . as we saw from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra2 ] this amounts to around 3ppm for zigzag tubes .",
    "( iii )  as mentioned before , in order to obtain the macroscopic component of the chemical shift tensor , we assumed that the bundle was of cylindrical shape .",
    "however , in a real sample , the bundle can assume shapes quite different from a perfect cylinder . to address this issue , we performed calculations assuming a spherical shape for the bundle . for the ( 14,0 ) tube , a typical nanotube of 1.1 nm diameter , the isotropic shift calculated for the cylinder was 125.3ppm , while the sphere gave 122.4ppm .",
    "note that , even if the difference , 3ppm , is much smaller than the experimental width of the mas spectrum , it has nevertheless the same magnitude as the difference between nanotubes of similar diameter .",
    "( iv )  finite - size swcnts can be either open , or capped by fullerene - like structures .",
    "it was found in ref .   that the carbon atoms close to the ends of these ( finite ) tubes can have an isotropic shift up to 20ppm larger than the atoms far from the ends . however , although not infinite , the swcnts present in experiment are quite long , so we do not expect this effect to contribute significantly to the nmr spectra .    (",
    "v )  other effects : clearly every experimental sample of swcnts contains defects and magnetic impurities which will contribute to the broadening of the mas peak .",
    "furthermore , there may be interactions of the semiconducting nanotubes with the conduction electrons of metallic tubes contained in the bundle , etc .",
    "we can see that effects ( i)(iii ) can contribute around @xmath82ppm to the width of the mas peak .",
    "we therefore expect that the remaining @xmath831030ppm of the experimental width@xcite are due to ( v ) .",
    "this means that by using better samples with a much lower concentration of magnetic impurities@xcite the resolution of @xmath0c nmr spectra can be improved by at most a factor of 2 .      also in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra2 ] we show the principal values of the chemical shift tensor for the bundles .",
    "the first principal value , @xmath84 corresponds to the longitudinal ( along the tube axis ) direction , @xmath85 lies on the orthoradial direction , and @xmath86 is the radial component of the chemical shift tensor . as expected",
    ", the chemical shift is extremely anisotropic , with the longitudinal and orthoradial directions corresponding to the in - plane directions of a graphene sheet ( or of a benzene molecule ) , and the radial component corresponding to the direction perpendicular to the sheet . as for the isotropic shift",
    ", the individual principal values are spread due to the interaction between the tubes in the bundle , but this time by as much as 10ppm .",
    "note that ref .   found a value of 20ppm for the broadening of the tensor due to the influence of the first neighbor tube ( and quasi - independent on the electronic properties of this first neighbor ) .",
    "there is , therefore , a partial cancellation when we include all the six neighbors in the hexagonal lattice .",
    "note that this 10ppm spread is much larger than the 3ppm spread of the isotropic line .",
    "it is also much larger than the difference between the two families of nanotubes we have studied .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : static ] we compare a simulation of the static spectrum of a @xmath87 tube with experimental results .",
    "the theoretical spectrum shows a typical powder line - shape with principal values @xmath88ppm , @xmath89ppm , and @xmath90ppm ( @xmath91ppm and @xmath92 ) .",
    "the two experimental curves are quite different from each other , so care must be taken when comparing theoretical to experimental spectra .",
    "in general , we believe that our results are in quite good agreement with experiments .",
    "the main difference turns out to be the value for the asymmetry factor , which is considerably smaller in our calculations than in the experimental works .",
    "recently , simon _ et al . _ studied double - wall nanotubes using nmr  @xcite .",
    "their samples were produced through the high - temperature annealing of isotope enriched fullerenes encapsulated in single - wall tubes . in this way",
    ", they were able to measure directly the chemical shift of the inner tube .",
    "they found an isotropic shift of 111ppm , which is significantly smaller than the isotropic shift of larger single wall tubes .",
    "the authors pointed out two possible reasons for this difference : ( i )  the stronger curvature of the inner tube , or ( ii )  diamagnetic shielding due to the outer tube .",
    "note that in our calculations the chemical shift _ increases _ with decreasing radius ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectra1 ] ) , which rules out ( i ) .    to study this problem",
    ", we performed _",
    "ab initio _ calculations of the isolated double - wall tube ( 8,0)@(16,0 ) .",
    "we obtained for the isotropic chemical shift of the atoms composing the inner tube a value of 111ppm [ to be compared with 132ppm for the isolated ( 8,0 ) tube ] , implying a diamagnetic shift due to the outer tube of 21ppm . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer tube had an isotropic chemical shift of 126ppm [ to be compared to 124ppm of the isolated ( 16,0 ) tube ] .",
    "note that our _ ab initio _",
    "result for the inner tube ( 111ppm ) coincides with the value measured in ref .  .",
    "in order to understand our results , and to study the effect of diamagnetic shielding , we will resort to a simple classical model .",
    "let us imagine that the outer nanotube has the form of a long hollow cylinder with axis parallel to @xmath93 .",
    "we will distinguish two cases , when the probing magnetic field @xmath94 and when @xmath95 .",
    "in the former case , the induced current @xmath96 on the surface of the cylinder can be written ( in linear response ) as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a constant .",
    "the magnetization per unit length can then be calculated from ( in cgs units ) @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the speed of light , @xmath101 is the lattice parameter in the periodic direction , @xmath13 is the diameter of the cylinder , and @xmath102 is the unit vector of direction @xmath24 .",
    "the volume of integration is one unit cell . remembering that @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the molar susceptibility parallel to the axis of the cylinder , @xmath105 is the avogadro number , and @xmath106 is the density of carbon atoms per unit area of the nanotube ( @xmath107nm@xmath108 ) , we can obtain the induced current @xmath109 on the other hand , it is a simple excercise of magnetostatics to calculate the magnetic field generated by @xmath110 and by the induced current .",
    "the total magnetic field ( @xmath111 ) inside the cylinder ( i.e. , the field felt by the inner nanotube ) is constant .",
    "furthermore @xmath112 note that as @xmath113 is negative for our nanotubes , eq .",
    "gives rise to a _",
    "diamagnetic shift_. the same derivation can be done for an external field perpendicular to the tube axis . in this case , the current is , for a magnetization in the @xmath114 direction , @xmath115 on the sides of the cylinder , and @xmath116 on its bases .",
    "the total ( external plus induced ) field inside the tube is still constant , and it reads @xmath117 we can now calculate the diamagnetic shift in the inner tube due to the presence of the outer tube . as a typical example we chose the double - wall tube ( 8,0)@(16,0 ) . inserting its diameter ( 1.26 nm ) and the calculated susceptibility ( @xmath118cgs / mol and @xmath119cgs / mol ) of the ( 16,0 ) tube in eqs .",
    "and   we obtain that the shift due to the shielding is @xmath120ppm and @xmath121ppm .",
    "this leads to an isotropic shift of @xmath122ppm . from our calculations ,",
    "the isotropic shift of the isolated ( 8,0 ) tube is 131ppm , which leads to a total chemical shift for the inner tube of @xmath123ppm .",
    "this is a fairly good agreement with our _ ab initio _",

    "we performed calculations of the magnetic susceptibility and @xmath0c chemical shift for semiconducting zigzag carbon nanotubes , both isolated and in bundles .",

    "for all nanotubes studied , the isotropic shift lies between 120ppm and 135ppm .",
    "this interval of 15ppm is quite narrow , and is at the limit of the precision that nmr experiments have obtained for these systems .",
