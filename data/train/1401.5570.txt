    "dust grains play an essential role in some fundamental physical processes in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "first , they dominate the radiative transfer of stellar light in the ism . in particular , the extinction curve , that is , the wavelength dependence of optical depth for dust absorption plus scattering is known to reflect the dust materials ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and grain size distribution ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter mrn ; @xcite ) .",
    "second , the dust surface is the main site for the formation of some molecular species , especially h@xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the rate of dust surface reaction is proportional to the total surface area of dust grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the extinction curve and the total grain surface area both depend strongly on the grain size distribution , clarifying the regulating mechanism of grain size distribution is of particular importance in understanding those important roles of dust in the ism .",
    "mrn showed that a mixture of silicate and graphite with a grain size distribution ( number of grains per grain radius ) proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the grain radius ( @xmath11@xmath12 m ) , reproduces the milky way extinction curve .",
    "this size distribution is referred to as the mrn size distribution . @xcite and @xcite made more detailed models of the milky way extinction curve . in both of these models ,",
    "the abundance of grains whose radii are beyond the maximum in the mrn size distribution ( 0.25  @xmath13 m ) is so low that the contribution of such large grains to the total dust mass is negligible .    the existence of micrometer ( @xmath13m)-sized grains is suggested in dense molecular cloud cores ( called dense cores in this paper ) .",
    "the so - called `` coreshine '' refers to emission in the mid - infrared ( especially the 3.6-@xmath13 m spitzer infrared array camera ( irac ) band ) from deep inside dense cores of molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "it is detected in about half of the cores studied by @xcite .",
    "the emission is interpreted as light scattered by dust grains with typical sizes of @xmath14 m , which is much larger than the maximum grain radius in the diffuse interstellar medium ( @xmath15 m ; mrn ) .",
    "we refer to @xmath13m - sized grains as `` very large grains ( vlgs ) '' in this paper .",
    "formation of vlgs by coagulation in dense cores has been theoretically investigated by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the timescale on which grains grow up to @xmath13 m sizes by coagulation , they argued that dense cores are sustained over several free - fall times . since their main aim was to constrain the lifetime of dense cores , the impact of vlg formation on the grain size distribution in the entire ism was beyond their scope .",
    "a certain fraction of vlgs formed in dense cores may be injected into the diffuse ism when the dense cores disperse .",
    "efficient formation of vlgs would contradict the mrn grain size distribution in which the maximum grain radius is @xmath15 m .",
    "thus , based on an estimation of the total abundance of vlgs in the milky way , we examine the consistency between the formation of vlgs suggested by coreshine and the galactic extinction curve ( or the mrn grain size distribution ) . in this paper ,",
    "the abundance of vlgs stands for the ratio of the total vlg mass to the total dust mass ( including vlgs ) , and is denoted as @xmath16 ( see section [ sec : estimate ] ) . by definition ,",
    "@xmath17 .",
    "there are some indications that vlgs exist in the ism .",
    "one of the indications of interstellar vlgs is provided by meteorites .",
    "large interstellar grains ( @xmath18 m ) are known to exist in chondritic meteorites .",
    "such grains were identified based on their extremely anomalous ( way off from the average solar system isotope ratios ) isotopic compositions @xcite .",
    "this implies that interstellar dust grains must have resided and survived in a dense core that ended up forming the solar system .",
    "another indication of interstellar vlgs comes from direct detection of interstellar grains in the heliosphere by _",
    "ulysses _ and _ galileo_. these experiments have shown that the volume mass density of vlgs is comparable to the total dust volume mass density derived from the typical dust - to - gas ratio in the diffuse ism in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "this seems contradictory to the above grain size distribution derived by mrn , who found that most of the dust grains have radii less than 0.25 @xmath13 m .",
    "thus , it has been argued that the density of vlgs is enhanced in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is still interesting to compare the vlg abundance expected from the formation in dense cores with the measurements , in order to quantify what fraction of the observed vlgs can be explained by the formation in dense cores .",
    "we may also need to consider stellar sources of dust grains , especially asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and supernovae ( sne ) for the production of vlgs .",
    "indeed , the size distribution of grains produced by agb stars is suggested to be biased toward large ( @xmath19 m ) sizes from the observations of spectral energy distributions @xcite , although @xcite showed that the grains are not single - sized .",
    "theoretical studies have also shown that the dust grains formed in the winds of agb stars have typical sizes @xmath19 m @xcite .",
    "sne ( type ii sne ) are also considered to produce relatively large ( @xmath20 m ) grains because small grains are destroyed by reverse shocks before they are ejected into the ism @xcite .",
    "however , the timescale of dust supply from stars is longer than the shattering timescale @xcite by an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , even if vlgs are supplied from stars , they probably fail to survive in the ism . in this paper",
    ", we do not treat the stellar production of vlgs because of the difficulty in their survival , but focus on their formation in dense cores , motivated by the new evidence of vlgs  coreshine .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the abundance of vlgs in the galaxy , assuming that dense cores are the main sites for the formation of vlgs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "we assume that all dense molecular cloud cores ( dense cores ) eventually convert a significant fraction of dust grains into vlgs by coagulation after their lifetimes . the formation rate of vlgs ( the total mass of vlgs is denoted as @xmath21 ) in dense cores in the galaxy , @xmath22_\\mathrm{form}$ ] ,",

    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmdt ] ) _ should not _ be regarded as an ordinary differential equation , but just gives an estimate for the vlg formation rate . since dense cores are also the sites of star formation , the star formation rate of the galaxy is estimated by dividing the total gas mass contained in the dense cores with their lifetime ( i.e. , the timescale of star formation ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total gas mass in the galaxy ( @xmath33 is the total gas mass in dense cores ) .",
    "this equation converts the core formation rate ( @xmath34 ) to the star formation rate , and serves to eliminate the core formation rate , which is unknown observationally compared with the star formation rate . by introducing the dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath35 and using eq .",

    "the timescale of dust enrichment ( i.e. , the timescale of the variation of @xmath25 or @xmath37 ) in the galaxy is roughly the metal - enrichment timescale ( @xmath38 several gyr ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is much longer than the lifetime of vlgs ( typically determined by the shattering timescale @xmath39 yr ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we can assume that @xmath25 and @xmath37 are constant within the lifetime of vlgs .",
    "in such a case , the total mass of vlgs can be approximately estimated as follows .",
    "it is shown that @xmath13m - sized grains are shattered in the diffuse ism by grain ",
    "grain collisions under the grain motion induced by turbulence @xcite .",
    "shattering also occurs in supernova shocks @xcite .",

    "the star formation rate in the galaxy can be estimated from the total luminosity of ob stars .",
    "@xcite obtained a star formation rate of 1.3 m@xmath44 based on the total ob star luminosity derived observationally by @xcite . according to @xcite , almost all the dust mass is in vlgs after coagulation in dense cores . here",

    "the physical mechanism of such an enhancement is still unknown @xcite .    for comparison",
    ", we also show the mrn @xcite grain size distribution ( @xmath78 , with the upper and lower limits of grain radius , 0.001 @xmath13 m and 0.25 @xmath13 m , respectively ) .",
    "the normalization of the mrn grain size distribution is determined so that the total dust mass density is @xmath79 with dust - to - gas ratio @xmath43 .",
    "this mrn size distribution is representative of the grain size distribution in the diffuse ism of the galaxy .",
    "the abundance of vlgs expected from star formation efficiency @xmath690.3 is well below the extrapolation of the mrn grain size distribution to @xmath80 m .",
    "this is consistent with a small vlg - to - total - dust mass ratio , @xmath54 ; that is , vlgs make only a small contribution to the total dust mass in the galaxy .",
    "the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction , the so - called extinction curve , is a viable tool to derive the grain size distribution .",
    "the mrn size distribution was derived by fitting the averaged interstellar extinction curve in the milky way . for the mrn size distribution ,",
    "the upper limit of the grain radius is 0.25 @xmath13 m .",
    "here we examine if the inclusion of vlgs is consistent with the galactic extinction curve or not .",
    "a possible caveat of extinction curve fitting is that the solution is not unique .",
    "for example , mrn adopted graphite for the carbonaceous material because of the strong 2175   bump , while @xcite proposed hydrogenated amorphous carbon .",
    "@xcite used the latter species for the carbonaceous dust component and reproduced both the extinction and emission of dust in the galaxy .",
    "the relative contribution between silicate and carbonaceous dust also depends on the material properties adopted . therefore , strictly speaking , adopting a specific model reproducing the extinction curve means that the following result only serves as an example of the effects of vlgs . however , our results below are valid at least qualitatively as long as large grains tend to show flat extinction curves in the optical and the 2175   bump is produced by small grains .",
    "we assume that grains are composed of two species : silicate and graphite .",
    "extinction curves are calculated by using the same optical properties of silicates and graphite as in @xcite .",
    "that is , we adopt the optical constants from @xcite and calculate extinction cross - sections by the mie theory @xcite .",
    "the cross - sections are weighted by the grain size distributions , and summed up for silicate and graphite .",
    "the fraction of silicate to the total dust mass is assumed to be 0.54 , and the rest is assumed to be graphite @xcite .",
    "the contributions from the mrn size distribution and from the vlgs to the total extinction are proportional to @xmath81 and @xmath16 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : extinc ] , we show the results .",
    "the extinction is normalized to the @xmath82 band ( 0.55 @xmath13 m ) , and the normalized extinction at wavelength @xmath83 is denoted as @xmath84 .",
    "we find that , even for star formation efficiency @xmath69 ( equivalent to vlg - to - total - dust mass ratio @xmath85 ) , there is only a slight difference from the extinction curve for the mrn model and another is the different value of @xmath86 ( note that the mean value of @xmath86 is 3.1 @xcite .",
    "however , the overall shape of the observed mean extinction curve ( shown by filled squares in fig .  [ fig : extinc ] ) is well reproduced by the mrn grain size distribution , and further fine - tuning does not affect the discussions and conclusion in this paper . ] with a little enhancement in infrared extinction , and slightly lower carbon bump and ultraviolet extinction .",
    "all these differences can be explained by the contribution from vlgs , as is clear from the extinction curve of the vlg component ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : extinc ] ) .",
    "however , the difference is negligible compared with the typical variation in the milky way @xcite .",
    "@xmath87 , which is an indicator of the flatness of extinction curve , is 3.6 and 3.7 for mrn and @xmath69 , respectively . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the difference is even smaller .",
    "therefore , our estimate of the vlg abundance is within the acceptable range as far as the variation of extinction curve is concerned .",
    "we also show an extreme case where @xmath88 , considering that the above _ ulysses _ and _ galileo _ data show a mass density of vlgs comparable to the total dust mass density in the diffuse ism ( i.e. , the mrn component in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] ) .",
    "the deviation from the mean galactic extinction curve is clear in this case . for this extinction curve ,",
    "we obtain @xmath89 , which is still in the range of the variation in the milky way extinction curve , but is not typical of the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "this again supports the view that the high vlg abundance is due to local enhancement .",
    "@xcite also calculated the extinction curve based on @xcite s model modified for the _ ulysses _ and _ galileo _ measurements .",

    "they also conclude that the large excess of @xmath13m - sized interstellar grains in the heliosphere is not representing the typical diffuse medium in the milky way but is probably due to local enhancement of vlg abundance .     ( corresponding to @xmath69 ) and @xmath88 ( as an extreme case , based on the _ ulysses _ and _ galileo _ data ) , respectively .",

    "the above estimate of @xmath16 ( the vlg - to - total - dust mass ratio ) is applicable to the milky way .",
    "galaxies in general are expected to have a variety in @xmath16 .",
    "the central hypothesis in this paper is that vlgs form in dense cores .",
    "this is probably true in solar - metallicity environments where dust - to - gas ratio is large enough for coagulation to occur efficiently in dense cores .",
    "in contrast , in a galaxy whose dust - to - gas ration is lower , coagulation in dense cores may not be efficient enough to produce vlgs ; in other words , @xmath3 is smaller if dust - to - gas ratio ( or metallicity ) is lower .",
    "since dust - to - gas ratio has a positive correlation with metallicity @xcite , we expect that @xmath16 is smaller in lower - metallicity galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that the major source of grains with @xmath91 m is stars ( sne and agb stars ) in low - metallicity ( or low - dust - to - gas - ratio ) environments . therefore ,",
    "if coagulation is not efficient , we expect that most of the vlgs ( if they exist ) are of stellar origin . as mentioned in introduction , the size distributions of grains produced by agb stars and sne",
    "are suggested to be biased toward large ( @xmath19 m ) sizes .",
    "however , there is still an uncertainty in the size distribution of dust grains formed in stellar ejecta . for more quantitative estimates of relative importance between stellar vlgs and dense - core vlgs",
    ", we need to construct a framework that takes into account all dust formation and destruction mechanisms as done by @xcite .",
    "since they did not include vlg formation in dense cores , it is necessary to implement it into their framework in the future .",
    "the stellar origin of vlgs is worth considering further . as mentioned in introduction , large interstellar grains ( @xmath92 m )",
    "exist in chondritic meteorites . given their large isotope anomalies that are reflective of stellar nucleosynthesis processes @xcite ,",
    "the grains may have formed in stellar ejecta .",
    "however , it is unlikely that grains formed in stellar ejecta have such a high abundance as observed by the spacecraft , since the timescale of dust supply from stellar sources is likely to be longer than the destruction timescale by shattering @xcite and sputtering @xcite . recently , @xcite have suggested that the lifetime of silicate dust is comparable to the destruction timescale , which means that the possibility of vlg formation in stellar ejecta is still worth investigating .    the existence of vlgs can have a significant influence on the extinction curve if there is local enhancement of vlg abundance as indicated by the spacecraft missions ( see the case of @xmath88 in fig .  [",
    "fig : extinc ] ) .",
    "thus , if we are concerned with the local variation of extinction curves , the contribution from vlgs should be taken into account . on global scales of a galaxy , in contrast , the abundance of vlgs is not high enough to affect the extinction curve , as long as the values of the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) are similar to the galactic values .",
    "the far - infrared spectral energy distribution is also affected by the existence of vlgs .",
    "the equilibrium temperature ( @xmath93 ) of a dust grain depends on the grain radius as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the power - law index of the mass absorption coefficient @xmath96 as a function of frequency @xmath97 , @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "because of this dependence , vlgs tend to be colder than `` normal '' grains with @xmath99 m . if the abundance of vlgs is high , we should consider a significant contribution from such a `` cold '' dust component .",
    "the star formation efficiency in dense cores , @xmath1 , is a key factor for the vlg - to - total - dust mass ratio @xmath16 .",
    "it enters our formulation in two ways .",
    "the first is through eq .",

    "this corresponds to a case in which the total mass of dense cores is large .    the volume density of vlgs measured by _",

    "[ fig : distribution ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath105 corresponds to @xmath106 , indicating an extremely low star formation efficiency . considering that star formation efficiencies observationally estimated for dense cores are @xmath1070.3 ( section [ subsec : estimate ] )",
    ", the high vlg abundance is probably due to local enhancement ( see also section [ subsec : extinc ] ) .      in galaxies ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath4 may also change .",
    "the gas consumption time @xmath2 ranges from @xmath39  yr to @xmath108  yr for nearby galaxies @xcite . in a starburst galaxy with @xmath109",
    "yr , if we adopt @xmath69 , @xmath45 and @xmath110  yr , we obtain @xmath111 .",
    "this large value is due to the enhanced formation rate of dense cores .",
    "therefore , the abundance of vlgs can be enhanced in starburst galaxies .",
    "if the typical dust size in starburst galaxies is really large and vlgs are continuously supplied there , it may have important consequence for the dust destruction efficiency by sputtering .",
    "since the timescale of dust destruction by thermal sputtering is proportional to the grain size @xcite , the vlgs survive longer than smaller grains",
    ". in particular , extreme starbursts at high redshift seems to have more dust than can be produced by stars with a dust lifetime expected for the `` normal - sized '' grains @xcite . the discrepancy is explained by grain growth through accretion of gas - phase metals in the ism @xcite .",
    "however , if the vlgs dominate the total dust mass , their longer survival would make the discrepancy smaller , requiring less grain growth than is thought in previous studies .",
    "this is also true for nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "however , in starburst galaxies , shattering may also be efficient .",
    "grains acquire larger velocities in the ionized medium than in the neutral medium because less dissipative magnetohydrodynamic nature of the ionized medium leads to more efficient gyroresonance ( resonance between the magnetohyrodynamical waves with the gyromotion of a grain ) acceleration of grains @xcite . as a result , @xmath4 is shorter in the ionized medium . therefore , if the ism is highly ionized as a result of high star formation activities in starburst galaxies , @xmath4 may decrease , compensating the decrease of @xmath2 in eq .",

    "@xcite showed that shattering in supernova shocks is as efficient as shattering in turbulence .",
    "they derived the timescale of shattering in supernova shocks @xmath112 , which gives the same order of magnitude as @xmath4 above .",
    "if we adopt this expression , the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath2 cancels out ( eq .  [ eq : phi ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : phi ] ) is useful to understand the dependence of the vlg abundance on star formation activity and shattering timescale .",

    "coreshine in dense molecular cloud cores ( dense cores ) is taken as evidence for such vlgs .",
    "assuming that vlgs are formed in dense cores , we have estimated the abundance of vlgs in the galaxy .",
    "the vlg abundance relative to the total dust mass is estimated as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the star formation efficiency in dense cores , @xmath2 is the timescale of gas consumption by star formation , @xmath3 is the fraction of dust mass eventually coagulated into vlgs in dense clouds , and @xmath4 is the lifetime of vlgs ( determined by shattering ) . adopting typical star formation efficiencies",
    "@xmath1140.3 , we obtain @xmath50.09 for the galaxy . this abundance is well below the value detected by _",
    "ulysses _ and _ galileo_. thus , if the vlgs originate from dense cores , local enhancement of vlg abundance in the solar neighborhood is necessary .",
    "we have also examined the effect of vlgs on the extinction curve , finding that the effect is negligible even with the upper value of the above range , @xmath6 . with @xmath7 , which is near the value of the above spacecraft data ,",
    "the extinction curve is still in the range of the variation in galactic extinction curves , but is not typical of the diffuse ism .",
    "this again supports the idea that the high vlg abundance in the heliosphere is due to local enhancement .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the explicit dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , can be used to estimate the vlg abundance in galaxies as well as in the milky way .",
