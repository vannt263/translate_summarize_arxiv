    "non - nuclear ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) in external galaxies have been known since the _ einstein _ era @xcite with apparent isotropic luminosities above the eddington limit of a 10@xmath3 black hole ( @xmath4 erg / s ) ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",

    "the nature of ulxs is still unclear .",
    "the major dispute arises from our observational ignorance of the angular distribution of the source emission .",
    "if x - rays are emitted isotropically , then the high luminosity indicates that the ulxs might harbor intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) with the mass in the order of @xmath5 or even higher @xcite .",
    "if the emission is beamed , then the ulxs could be stellar mass black holes @xcite .    evidence that the luminosities are truly high for some ulxs has been found from their associations with optical nebula which show indications of x - ray ionization @xcite .",
    "the photoionizing flux required to power the nebula surrounding one ulx requires a luminosity greater than @xmath6 erg / s @xcite .",
    "optical nebulae associated with some ulxs also show shock emission indicative of unusually powerful explosions @xcite .",
    "x - ray spectral analysis has revealed thermal components in the spectra of several ulxs with temperatures of 0.1 - 0.3  kev @xcite , which are lower than that in stellar mass black holes in high states , suggesting accretion onto a black hole with higher mass @xcite . also , a few ulxs exhibit breaks in their timing power spectra at relatively low frequencies which have been interpreted as evidence for high black hole masses @xcite . however , such interpretations are ambiguous due to our lack of understanding of timing power spectra and the fact that some stellar - mass black holes occasionally exhibit breaks at similar frequencies @xcite .",
    "_ xmm _ is more powerful for spectral and timing analysis than previous x - ray telescopes owing to its large effective area .",
    "the goal of this paper is to use _ xmm _ archival data to study the spectral and timing behaviors of ulxs in nearby galaxies . in ",

    "we derive our source sample from previously reported ulx detections .",

    ", e.g.  the ulxs in m82 . starting from these three catalogs and applying the criteria above , which are solely intended to enable us to perform reliable spectral and timing analysis , we produced a final sample of 28 sources , see table [ tab : data ] .",
    "hereafter we refer to sources by their number in table [ tab : data ] since not every ulxs has a common name .",
    "our sample is not meant to constitute an unbiased survey of nearby galaxies for ulxs .",
    "rather , it is intended to provide a sample with which we can examine the spectral and timing properties of sources previously reported as ulxs in the literature .",
    "all data were processed using _ sas _",
    "6.1.0 with the most recent calibration files as of march 2005 .",
    "we extracted single and double events ( pattern @xmath7 4 ) for pn data with the addition of triple events ( pattern @xmath7 12 ) for mos data .",
    "for spectral analysis , we required flag @xmath8 0 and screened for good time intervals without background flares . for timing analysis , we required flag equal to # xmmea_em for mos and # xmmea_ep for pn , and selected a continuous good time interval without background flare contamination or data gaps .",
    "we found that gaps in the _ xmm - newton _ data stream often cause spurious timing signals in the frequency region @xmath9 hz .",
    "therefore it is better to avoid gaps than attempt to fill them , e.g.  with an average count rate .",
    "source counts are generally extracted from a 32-radius circle , following the recommendation in the data analysis threads on the xmm sas web page at http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es / sas / documentation / threads/. for some very bright isolated sources , we used a 40-radius circle ( this results in an increase in luminosity by a few percents but no difference in spectral parameters within errors ) . for sources in crowded regions or with a strong diffuse background",

    "the energy spectra are extracted from individual mos and pn detectors and then grouped for fitting .",
    "the light curves are obtained from the merged events files .",

    "the x - ray source , according to the coordinates ra=13h25m07.45s , dec=-43d04m09.53s ( j2000 ) from chandra @xcite , corresponds to an optical counterpart that is included in the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite with an apparent magnitude @xmath66 mag and @xmath67 mag , corresponding to an absolute magnitude @xmath68 mag and @xmath69 .",

    "one plausible interpretation for the hot diffuse plasma components is that they are young supernova remnants .",
    "the derived density , total energy , and cooling time are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the x - ray luminosities and temperatures of these three sources are similar to recent supernovae ( e.g.  sn 1979c , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high absolute magnitudes of the optical counterparts indicates they are not normal stars .",
    "comparison with the late - time absolute magnitude of sn 1979c ( @xmath80  mag , @xmath81  mag ) , suggests that they may be supernova remnants which are several tens years old .",
    "we do not find supernovae counterparts on the iau supernova list , but the supernova may easily have been missed .",
    "source 22 is found to have noise power above the poisson level , which could not be produced by a spatially extended source .",
    "however , more than 2/3 of the luminosity arises from the power - law emission . the low frequency noise for source 22 ( the first two points in fig .",
    "[ fig : psd ] ) is strongest in the 110 kev band , where the energy spectrum is dominated by the power - law component also .",
    "therefore , the variability appears related to the power - law rather than the mekal component and may arise from a central compact object .",
    "three sources ( 3 , 6 , and 7 ) have spectra which are strongly curved at high energies in strong contrast to most of the other sources . from the mcd",
    "fits , we found that the sources have high temperatures and are either super - eddington for a stationary black hole or near eddington for a rapidly rotating black hole .",

    "@xcite suggested that source 3 ( m33 x-8 ) is a stellar - mass black hole in the high state because its behavior is similar to that of galactic black hole x - ray binaries .",

    "other interpretations for the high temperatures in some ulxs include intermediate mass black holes in the kerr metric @xcite or black holes of several tens of solar masses with slim accretion disks ( advection dominated optically thick disks ) emitting at super - eddington luminosities @xcite .",
    "these interpretations are based on results showing that single multicolor disk blackbody spectrum provide the best fits for high - temperature ulxs @xcite .",
    "our results based on the high quality spectra available from _ xmm - newton _ show that a single mcd provides a significantly worse fit than a comptonization model",
    ". a mcd model with an additional power - law component can provide an equally good fit , but the power - law is dominant at low energies , which is different from the behavior usually seen from galactic black hole binaries where the power - law component is usually weak when then source is in the thermal dominant state which shows prominent mcd emission near 1  kev @xcite .",
    "interpretation of the low - energy part of power - law as due to comptonization would be problematic because the seed photons upscattered by comptonization are usually assumed to arise from the disk emission @xcite .",
    "power - law components extending below the disk emission have been found in the spectra of the black hole candidates lmc x-1 and lmc x-3 @xcite , but are likely better interpreted in terms of physically motivated comptonized mcd models @xcite .",
    "in the comptonization model , a high electron column density @xmath82 , is required to produce the observed optical depths @xcite .",
    "since heavy ions would not be ionized at the inferred temperatures , strong fe k absorption should be observed unless the material has very low metallicity .",
    "no fe k absorption is apparent in the data , but the constraints are weak due to the limited statistics at high energies . adding a smeared edge model to the comptonization spectra with a central energy of 7  kev , optical depths up to @xmath83 are allowed , depending on the edge width .",
