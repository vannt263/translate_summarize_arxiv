    "wall bounded turbulence is highly relevant to a variety of engineering systems and naturally occurring flows .",
    "as such , the importance of the fundamental understanding of the generation of turbulent fluctuations by fluid - solid interactions in the boundary layers and their transport and interaction with the bulk mean flow @xcite is evident . in many geophysical and industrial flows , shear flows and wall turbulence are subjected to either stable or unstable thermal stratifications .",
    "stable stratification is known to inhibit the bursting phenomenon , i.e. depleting the transport of turbulent fluctuations from the wall to the bulk , thus reducing the turbulent drag and increasing the mean flow velocity .",
    "many studies have been devoted to this situation when the stratified scalar field is passive @xcite and active @xcite and even in presence of non - oberbeck - boussinesq effects @xcite .",
    "the unstable configuration is also relevant in a variety of instances , such as the physics of the atmospheric surface layer superposed to an over - heated ground ( as , e.g. , in summer days , determining the generation of thermo - convective storms @xcite ) ; when buoyancy forces are strong enough , thermal convection can occur , altering significantly the unstable boundary layer dynamics .",
    "early theoretical results on turbulent boundary layers under unstable thermal stratification date back to @xcite who pioneered a mixing - length based approach which inspired the later work of @xcite anticipating the monin - obukhov similarity theory @xcite , and subsequently revised and compared with experimental data by @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed an eddy - damped quasi - gaussian closure able to predict the inversion regions of heat flux profiles in strongly buoyant sheared boundary layers .",
    "numerical results @xcite and experimental flume measurements ( combined with a spectral equation model ) @xcite showed that natural thermal convection affects the mechanisms of momentum and heat transport from the wall and tends to flatten the velocity profile in the bulk ; these observation were confirmed by large - eddy simulations of a variable density fluid @xcite , although with non - boussinesq effects , as , e.g. profile asymmetries emerging at large stratifications .    in this work",
    "we perform direct numerical simulations based on the lattice boltzmann ( hereafter lb ) method of an unstably ( thermally ) stratified turbulent channel flow .",
    "our focus is on identifying the effects of buoyancy on the channel flow structure by comparing profiles of mean fields and fluctuations over a wide range of parameters with a pure ( unstratified ) channel flow .",
    "our results show a decreased fluid throughput due to a strongly flattened velocity profile , which could , however , be fitted by a log - law with coefficients depending on the input controlling parameters ( friction reynolds number @xmath2 and rayleigh number @xmath1 , defined below ) , as also derived theoretically .",
    "we simulated a fluid enclosed between two walls , kept at fixed temperatures @xmath3 at @xmath4 and @xmath5 at @xmath6 , and driven by a constant pressure gradient @xmath7 along the streamwise direction @xmath8 ( see figure [ sketch ] ) .",
    "the equations of motion are the incompressible navier - stokes equation for the fluid velocity field @xmath9 in the boussinesq approximation ( namely , the density is assumed to be constant @xmath10 , but for the linearised buoyancy term ) @xmath11 ( @xmath12 being the mean temperature ) coupled with the advection - diffusion equation for the temperature field @xmath13 @xmath14 in the above equations , @xmath15 is the fluctuating pressure field ( rescaled by @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 the acceleration of gravity , @xmath18 a constant acceleration due to the imposed pressure head @xmath7 ; @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the kinematic viscosity , the thermal diffusivity and thermal expansion coefficient , respectively . as a numerical scheme",

    "the method has been extensively used to study both thermal convection @xcite and turbulent channel flow @xcite ; in particular @xcite validated the code and tested grid resolutions against previous studies with different numerical methods .",
    "we used a computational grid @xmath22 of @xmath23 lattice points , with each run longer than @xmath24 time steps ( in lb units ) , in such a way to achieve statistically steady states of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 being the large - scale eddy turnover time ) .",

    "an evident effect of thermal stratification is a decrease of the centreline velocity and a flattening of the profiles at increasing @xmath1 ; indeed , mixing between the bulk and the boundary layer regions due to wall - normal thermal fluctuations ( or `` plumes '' ) results in an increase of the effective wall drag @xcite .",

    "+ applying the reynolds decomposition @xmath71 for the velocity field and averaging the navier - stokes equation for the @xmath8 velocity component , we get , upon integration in @xmath46 , an exact relation @xcite between the mean shear @xmath72 and the reynolds stress @xmath73 namely : @xmath74 or , in wall units : @xmath75 notice that equations ( [ eq : avens1])-([eq : avens2 ] ) remain valid also in the presence of buoyancy , since the forcing term @xmath76 does not act along the streamwise direction . for very large @xmath2 ( in principle @xmath77 ) , equation ( [ eq : avens2 ] ) gives @xmath78 ; close to the wall ( for @xmath70 ) , then , where viscous terms dominate , @xmath79 whence @xmath80 which implies @xmath81 , as anticipated above .",
    "conversely , away from the wall ( typically for @xmath82 ) , turbulent fluctuations dominate over viscous processes and @xmath83 , i.e. @xcite @xmath84 such result alone , however , does not give any further insight on the behaviour of the velocity profile in the corresponding region of the channel . to this aim , we need to consider the budget equation of turbulent kinetic energy @xmath85 @xcite . in the log - law layer",
    "the energy production @xmath86 is balanced by dissipation @xmath87 @xcite ; the latter can not be calculated exactly but only inferred by means of phenomenological arguments : for large reynolds number and outside the viscous boundary layer , the dissipation equals the turbulent energy flux , which can be estimated as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the typical eddy turn - over time at @xmath46 @xcite .",

    "the energy production by buoyancy term , viz .",
    "the heat flux , needs also to be modelled ; although more refined closures can be employed @xcite involving tensorial eddy diffusivities and coupling with gradients of the temperature field in all directions , we adopt a simple standard mixing length _ ansatz _",
