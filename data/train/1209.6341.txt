    "the airy@xmath0 and airy@xmath1 processes are universal processes describing the fluctuation of interfaces for stochastic growth models in the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class .",
    "the persistence probability is the probability that a process stays positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) , or more generally , above ( resp .",
    "below ) a certain threshold during a time interval @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "when the process is stationary , it might be expected that the persistence probability decays exponentially in @xmath3 .",
    "the airy processes were obtained by studying specific models in the kpz universality class  @xcite .",
    "it was only in 2010 that in an amazing experiment with turbulent nematic liquid crystals takeuchi and sano  @xcite were able to verify experimentally the kpz predictions at the level of distribution functions and covariances ( and not only at the level of the scaling exponents ) .",
    "the agreement with the theory is very good .    in a recent paper the same authors  @xcite measured , among others , the spatial persistence coefficients with respect to a threshold given by the average of the process . in the case of the airy@xmath1 process",
    ", the persistence coefficients have been also measured in an off - lattice eden model  @xcite and verified by a numerical simulation of gue dyson s brownian motion  @xcite .    in this short paper",
    "we determine analytic formulas for the persistence probability to stay below a threshold @xmath4 , both for the airy@xmath0 and the airy@xmath1 processes .",
    "the starting point are the two works on the continuum statistics  @xcite .",
    "then we focus on the case of the airy@xmath0 process and determine the associated persistence coefficient and its dependence on the threshold @xmath4 .",
    "this is made by using the numerical approach for computing fredholm determinants developed by bornemann in  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of looking directly at the limit process is that we do not have uncontrolled uncertainties coming from the finite size settings of an experimental setup or of a numerical simulation .",
    "the authors would like to thank k.  takeuchi for early discussions on his results and f.  bornemann for giving advices on how to use his matlab program .",
    "this work was supported by the german research foundation via the sfb611a12 project .",
    "in order to state the results , let us introduce some notations .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the airy@xmath0 process and by @xmath6 the airy@xmath1 process , see the review  @xcite for the definition of these processes . for a threshold @xmath7 and a time interval @xmath2 $ ] with @xmath8 ,",

    "the persistence probabilities decay exponential in @xmath3 with persistence coefficients @xmath11 given by @xmath12 as it can be seen from figure  [ figairy1average ] and figure  [ figairy1zero ] below , the exponential decay of the persistence probabilities for the airy@xmath0 process is already observed at relatively small values of @xmath3 , for instance already at @xmath13 .",
