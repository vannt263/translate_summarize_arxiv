    "the three necessary conditions for explaining the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , suggested several decades ago by sakharov [ 1 ] , are the violation of baryon number conservation , the violation of both c and cp , and the deviation from thermal equilibrium . as is well known , in order to ensure sufficient deviation from thermal equilibrium , the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) that is responsible for the baryogenesis should be strongly first - order , since otherwise the baryon asymmetry generated during the ewpt would subsequently disappear .",
    "the criterion for strength of the ewpt is given by the baryon preservation condition @xmath1 [ 2 ] , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the critical vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and the critical temperature .",
    "in the literature , a large number of articles have been devoted to the possibility of establishing the strongly first - order ewpt in various theoretical models , including the standard model ( sm ) which is naturally the primary candidate .",
    "it has been found however that the sm is inadequate to accommodate the desired ewpt , because it can not produce the cp violation large enough to generate the baryon asymmetry by means of the complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix alone [ 3,4 ] , and it can not make the ewpt strong enough unless the mass of the sm higgs boson is below the present experimental lower bound .",
    "attentions have been paid to alternative models beyond the sm within the context of the electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "those models embedded in the supersymmetry ( susy ) , having at least two higgs doublets , are considered as the most plausible alternatives since they can bring about additional sources of cp violation in their higgs sectors [ 5 ] . among them , it has been shown that the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with a light stop quark , being consistent with the present experimental bounds for both the higgs bosons and the supersymmetric particles , allows the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis [ 6 - 14 ] .",
    "the tree - level higgs potential of the non - minimal supersymmetric standard models , extended from the mssm by introducing an additional higgs singlet , may possess trilinear terms in higgs fields .",
    "it has been studied that these trilinear terms may lead the models to the electroweak baryogenesis satisfying the baryon preservation condition in a wide parameter space , without requiring a light stop quark [ 15 - 21 ] .",
    "we have also studied several models for the possibility of the strongly first - order ewpt [ 22 - 24 ] .",
    "recently , an mssm with @xmath0 gauge symmetry has been our subject [ 24 ] .",
    "this model is found to satisfy the baryon preservation for a wide parameter space , without requiring scalar - pseudoscalar mixing or a light stop quark below top quark mass .",
    "this model may also accommodate new sources of cp violation in its susy soft terms , which allow enough baryon creation .",
    "it is mainly because its tree - level higgs potential possesses the trilinear terms like the non - minimal supersymmetric models .    in this paper",
    ", we continue to study the mssm with @xmath0 , this time including the explicit cp violation . in the explicit cp violation scenario",
    ", we examine carefully whether the strongly first - order ewpt may be realized in the model .",
    "we take into account the radiative corrections due to top and stop quarks , with the scalar - pseudoscalar mixings .",
    "we find that a strongly first - order ewpt is indeed viable for some parameter space of this model in explicit cp violation scenario .",
    "then , we investigate the effects of the cp mixing between scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons , which is produced by the cp phase in the stop quark masses , on the strength of the first - order ewpt .",
    "we find that the cp phase arising from the stop quark masses reduces slightly the strength of the first - order ewpt . on the other hand",
    ", the lightest higgs boson mass does not seriously affect the strength of the first - order ewpt , since it may be either enhanced or reduced by increasing the lightest higgs boson mass , depending on other parameters .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm with @xmath0 consists of two higgs doublets @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and a neutral higgs singlet @xmath6 [ 25 - 34 ] . retaining only the yukawa coupling of top quark",
    ", the superpotential of this model may be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the top yukawa coupling coefficient , @xmath9 is the left - handed quark doublet superfield of the third generation , @xmath10 is the charge conjugate of the right - handed top quark superfield , @xmath11 is the dimensionless coupling constant , and @xmath12 is a @xmath13 antisymmetric matrix defined as @xmath14 .",
    "the tree - level higgs potential of this model at zero temperature may be decomposed into @xmath15-terms , @xmath16-terms , and soft terms as @xmath17 with @xmath18   \\ , \\cr v_d & = & { g_2 ^ 2 \\over 8 } ( h_1^{\\dagger } \\vec\\sigma h_1 + h_2^{\\dagger } \\vec\\sigma h_2)^2 + { g_1 ^ 2 \\over 8 } ( |h_1|^2 - |h_2|^2)^2 \\cr & & \\mbox{}+ { g^{'2}_1 \\over 2 } ( { \\tilde q}_1 |h_1|^2 + { \\tilde q}_2 |h_2|^2 + { \\tilde q}_3 |s|^2)^2 \\ , \\cr v_{\\rm s } & = & m_1 ^ 2 |h_1|^2 + m_2 ^ 2 |h_2|^2 + m_3 ^ 2 |s|^2 - [ \\lambda a_{\\lambda } h_1^t \\epsilon h_2 s + { \\rm h.c . } ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are respectively the gauge coupling coefficients of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath0 , @xmath24 are pauli matrices , @xmath25 is the trilinear soft susy breaking parameter with mass dimension , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 = 1 - 3 ) are soft susy breaking masses , and @xmath28 ( @xmath27 = 1 - 3 ) are respectively the effective @xmath0 charges of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the effective @xmath0 charges of the higgs fields satisfy the identity relation of @xmath31 in order to ensure the @xmath0 gauge invariance .",
    "the soft susy breaking masses are then eliminated by the three minimum conditions of the higgs potential .",
    "the three minimum conditions define the vacuum and the vacuum expectation values of the three neutral higgs fields at zero temperature , namely , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where we assume that the higgs singlet @xmath6 may develop a complex vev .    besides the phase @xmath35 , the higgs potential may explicitly contain complex coefficients .",
    "while other terms can be made real through redefinition of the higgs fields , the trilinear terms , @xmath36 , may remain complex .",
    "thus , we are left with a complex phase @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the phase of @xmath11 and @xmath39 is that of @xmath25 . at the tree level , this complex phase @xmath40 can always be eliminated by rotating suitably the relevant higgs fields .",
    "the higgs potential does not yield any cp mixing among the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs fields [ 33,34 ] .    at the one - loop level ,",
    "a non - trivial complex phase emerges in the stop quark masses , which yields the mixing of the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons . in general",
    ", the contributions from the top and stop quark loops are most dominant at the one - loop level for a wide parameter space .",
    "the one - loop effective potential , at zero temperature , due to the top and stop quark loops is given as [ 35 ] @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the renormalization scale in the modified minimal subtraction scheme , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) are respectively the degrees of freedom for top and stop quarks from color , charge , and spin factors .",
    "we assume that the left - handed and right - handed stop quarks are not degenerate .",
    "then , the stop quark masses are given as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the soft susy breaking mass , @xmath48 is the mass of top quark , @xmath49 is the trilinear susy breaking parameter with mass dimension , and @xmath50 is a phase originating from the phases of @xmath11 , @xmath49 , and @xmath51 .    in case of explicit cp violation , at the one - loop level , the non - trivial tadpole minimum condition with respect to the pseudoscalar component of the higgs field is given as @xmath52 where @xmath40 , which can be eliminated by rotating the neutral higgs fields at the tree level , can not be so at the one - loop level , and the dimensionless function @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 + 1 \\ .\\ ] ]    in the present model , there are four neutral higgs fields .",
    "the physical higgs bosons and their squared masses are given respectively by the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues , denoted as @xmath55 ( @xmath27 = 1 - 4 ) , of the @xmath56 mass matrix for the neutral higgs fields .",
    "we sort these four neutral higgs bosons in the increasing order of their masses such that @xmath57 is the smallest eigenvalue and @xmath58 is the lightest neutral higgs boson .",
    "the explicit expression for the mass matrix may be found elsewhere [ 33,34 ] .",
    "the elements of the mass matrix , which are responsible for the mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons , are proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the cp mixing in the present model at the one - loop level is triggered by @xmath50 , which is practically the only source of cp violation in this model . if @xmath60 , these four neutral higgs bosons may be classified into three scalar and a pseudoscalar higgs bosons .",
    "up to now , we have studied the higgs potential of the mssm with @xmath0 at zero temperature .",
    "we now include the thermal effects to the higgs potential in order to examine its behavior at the finite temperature .",
    "for the thermal effects , we take into account the one - loop contributions due to the top and stop quarks at finite temperature @xmath61 , which is given as [ 36 ] @xmath62 \\cr & & + \\sum_{i = 1 , 2 } { n_{{\\tilde t}_i } t^4 \\over 2 \\pi^2 }              \\int_0^{\\infty } dx \\ x^2 \\              \\log \\left [ 1 - \\exp{\\left ( - \\sqrt { x^2+{{\\cal m}_{{\\tilde t}_i}^2/t^2 } } \\right )   } \\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term represents the thermal effects of top quark , and second term those of the stop quarks , and the temperature dependence is explicitly shown .",
    "the masses of the field - dependent stop quarks in the above expression contain implicitly @xmath50 that triggers the cp violation .",
    "the full effective potential at the one - loop level at finite temperature is therefore @xmath63 .    in order to study the possibility of a strongly first - order ewpt in this model",
    ", we examine if the full effective potential may develop two degenerate vacua at finite temperature , which is the critical temperature for the phase transition , and also examine if it may satisfy the baryon preservation condition .",
    "it is known that the trilinear terms proportional to @xmath25 in the tree - level higgs potential of the present model allows a strongly first - order ewpt for a wide parameter space , if the cp violation is turned off in its higgs sector [ 34 ] .",
    "then , we are mainly interested in the behavior of the present model in the presence of an explicit cp violation in its higgs sector .",
    "in particular , we study the dependence of the strength of the strongly first - order ewpt upon the size of cp violation .    in terms of the vevs at finite temperature , the vacuum is determined by the minimum of the following effective potential , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath51 are now the temperature - dependent vacuum expectation values with @xmath67 \\cr & & \\mbox { } + \\sum_{i=1}^2 { 3 t^4",

    "\\     \\log \\left [ 1 - \\exp{\\left ( - \\sqrt { x^2 + m_{{\\tilde t}_i}^2(v_1 , v_2 , s)/t^2 } \\right )   } \\right ]   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the minimum conditions for the one - loop effective potential at the zero temperature may express the soft susy masses @xmath26 ( @xmath68 ) in @xmath69 as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 are the zero - temperature vacuum expectation values of the three neutral higgs fields . notice the presence of the phase @xmath40 , which is expressible as the other parameters via the tadpole minimum condition at the one - loop level shown in the previous section .    the procedure of exploring the parameter space of the present model starts with reducing the number of variables . by calculating @xmath74 , which is one of the minimum conditions that the first derivatives of the effective potential should satisfy , we obtain the following nonlinear equation , @xmath75 which can be used to express @xmath51 in terms of other variables , @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    "thus , by substituting @xmath51 into @xmath76 , we are left with @xmath77 .    for given set of relevant parameter values",
    ", we search the minima of @xmath77 in the @xmath78-plane , varying the temperature . if two independent but degenerate minima are found for a given temperature , it is the critical temperature , @xmath3 , and the shape of the potential at the temperature allows a first - order ewpt .",
    "let one minimum point in the @xmath78-plane be a , and the other , b. the distance between a and b is given as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are obtained by inverting the above nonlinear equation , by means of the bisection method .",
    "the critical vacuum expectation value , @xmath82 , is defined as the distance between the two degenerate minima .",
    "then , by comparing @xmath82 with the critical temperature , we can check if the baryon preserving condition is satisfied . in this way",
    ", the possibility of a strongly first - order ewpt is established in the mssm with @xmath0 , with explicit cp violation .",
    "now , for numerical analysis , we set the renormalization scale @xmath42 as 300 gev and the mass of top quark as 175 gev .",
    "the effective @xmath0 charges , @xmath28 , may be redefined as @xmath83 , for the sake of convenience , because @xmath28 always go together with the @xmath0 gauge coupling constant [ 34 ] .",
    "like @xmath28 , @xmath84 also satisfy the @xmath0 gauge invariance condition , @xmath85 .",
    "we have established the experimentally allowed region in the ( @xmath86)-plane in ref . [",
    "34 ] , using such constraints as the extra gauge boson mass and the mixing angle between the two neutral gauge boson @xmath87 .",
    "we adopt the results of ref .",
    "[ 34 ] , namely , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "we further set for our numerical analysis @xmath91 , @xmath92 gev , and @xmath93 gev .",
    "then , we are left with four free parameters : @xmath50 , @xmath11 , @xmath25 , and @xmath61 in the full effective potential .    in fig .",
    "1 , the equipotential contours of the effective potential at the one - loop level , @xmath77 , are plotted in the ( @xmath94)-plane for @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 gev , and @xmath98 gev .",
    "we take a very small value for the phase @xmath50 in order to study the case of an almost exact cp conservation . since there are two degenerate minima in fig . 1 , @xmath98 gev is the critical temperature , and a first - order ewpt is possible .",
    "let us examine the strength of the phase transition .",
    "the coordinates of the two minima in the ( @xmath94)-plane determine the vevs at the two degenerate vacua as : @xmath99 and @xmath100 in gev .",
    "note that @xmath51 is obtained indirectly through the nonlinear equation .",
    "the critical vev is then calculated to be about @xmath101 gev for fig .",
    "thus , the baryon preserving condition is satisfied enough since @xmath102 .",
    "it is therefore possible that the present model accommodates a strongly first - order ewpt .",
    "the masses of the four neutral higgs bosons are obtained using the parameter values in fig . 1 as 73 , 792 , 1748 , and 1750 gev .    in fig .",
    "2 , the equipotential contours of @xmath77 are plotted in the ( @xmath94)-plane for @xmath103 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 gev , and @xmath104 gev .",
    "we take the maximal value of the phase @xmath50 for the cp violation , that is , @xmath105 , in order to study the effect of the cp phase on the strength of the phase transition .",
    "the critical temperature in fig .",
    "2 is 147 gev , since there are two degenerate minima .",
    "the coordinates of the minima are the same as fig .",
    "1 , hence the critical vev is the same as fig .",
    "1 . however , the critical temperature is different from fig . 1 , and therefore the strength of the phase transition is different from fig",
    ". 1 : it is @xmath106 .",
    "we find that the strength of the phase transition is reduced .",
    "also , we find that the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson is slightly increased as @xmath50 is changed from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "we continue our numerical analysis for other parameter values . in fig .",
    "3 , the equipotential contours of @xmath77 are plotted in the ( @xmath94)-plane for @xmath95 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 gev , and @xmath98 gev .",
    "the strength of the first - order ewpt is estimated to be about 6.24 .",
    "the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson is about 79 gev . in fig .",
    "4 , for @xmath103 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 gev , the critical temperature is about @xmath111 gev .",
    "we find that the strength of the first - order ewpt is decreased from 6.24 to 4.36 , and the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson is slightly increased from 79 gev to about 80 gev , as @xmath50 is changed from @xmath107 to @xmath108 , comparing the numerical results of fig .",
    "4 with those of fig .",
    "the effect of @xmath50 that accounts for the cp mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons upon the strength of the first - order ewpt seems rather straightforward , if we compare fig . 1 with fig .",
    "2 , or fig .",
    "3 with fig .",
    "4 . increasing the size of the cp mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons would result in decreasing the strength of the phase transition . on the other hand",
    ", the relationship between the strength of the first - order ewpt and the mass of the lightest higgs boson may be seen clearly if we compare fig . 1 with fig . 3 or fig .",
    "2 with fig .",
    "4 , since in this way we can exclude the effect of @xmath50 . comparing fig . 1 with fig .",
    "3 , where @xmath50 is fixed at @xmath107 , it is evident that the strength of the phase transition increases as the mass of the lightest higgs boson increases .",
    "this behavior is also observed if we compare fig .",
    "2 with fig .",
    "4 , where @xmath50 is fixed at @xmath108 . combining these two observations",
    ", one might expect that in the mssm with @xmath0 in explicit cp violation scenario the strength of the phase transition increases if the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson increases or if the size of the cp mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons decreases .",
    "we summarize in table 1 the relevant numbers for figs . 1 - 4 .",
    ".the values of relevant parameters in figs . 1 - 4 which allow a strongly first - order ewpt in the mssm with @xmath0 in explicit cp violation scenario , and the numerical results .",
    "the remaining parameters are set as @xmath112 , @xmath92 gev , and @xmath93 gev .",
    "the arrow in a cell indicates that the values in the cell is equal to those in the adjoining left cell . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the mssm with @xmath0 in explicit cp violation scenario , at the effective one - loop level , we study the possibility of a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition .",
    "the radiative corrections are evaluated by employing the effective potential method , taking into account the top and stop quark loops .",
    "the explicit cp violation is triggered by a phase arising in the stop quark masses .",
    "we have searched for the parameter space of the model to find that some region in the parameter space allows a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition .",
    "four sets of parameter values are selected and plotted in figures in order to show explicitly that a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition is possible indeed .",
    "it is natural that the strength of the phase transition would change if we choose different sets of parameter values .",
    "in particular , it may depend on the size of the phase for the cp mixing between the scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons .",
    "we find that the strength of the strongly first - order electroweak phase transition decreases as the phase for the cp mixing increases .",
    "the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson is also changed as the parameter values are changed .",
    "we find that , for a fixed value of the cp phase , the lightest neutral higgs boson becomes heavier when the strength of the phase transition is enhanced .",
    "in other words , if the phase transition is stronger for a set of parameter values than for another set of parameter values , then the mass of the lightest higgs boson is also larger for the former set of parameter values than for the latter .",
