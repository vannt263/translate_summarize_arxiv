    "there is growing observational evidence that the physical properties of galaxy clusters obey scaling relations .",
    "evrard ( 1997 ) showed that most observed clusters of galaxies have a similar fraction of hot gas , as compared total mass , @xmath12 .",
    "this fraction sets a lower limit on the baryon fraction in these dark matter dominated objects .",
    "furthermore , studies focusing on the relationship between the x - ray luminosity of the hot gas ( or intracluster medium , hereafter icm ) and its x - ray temperature done by markevitch ( 1998 ) , allen & fabian ( 1998 ) and arnaud & evrard ( 1998 ) have revealed a relatively tight correlation between these two parameters .",
    "recently mohr & evrard ( 1997 ) found that there exists a strong correlation between the x - ray isophotal radius and the x - ray temperature of the hot icm .",
    "the study of hjorth , oukbir & van kampen ( 1998 ) , based on a sample of clusters with good x - ray temperature estimates and mass inferred from lensing observations , suggests that there is a tight mass  temperature relation .",
    "such scaling laws are expected if clusters of galaxy form a homologous population and are an indication of an underlying structural regularity in the cluster population .",
    "hence their study can give useful insight into the formation and evolution of clusters and the underlying cosmological scenario .",
    "in addition they can provide an efficient way to estimate some cluster properties , which are difficult to measure directly .",
    "in particular the m ",
    "t relation is of special interest , in view of the cosmological importance of determining cluster masses and the possibility to measure accurately the temperature with current and future x - ray telescopes .",
    "structural regularity is expected on theoretical grounds ( teyssier , chize & alimi 1997 ) .",
    "numerical simulations by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , 1997 ) indicate that cdm - halos with masses spanning several orders of magnitudes follow a universal density profile , whose shape is independent of mass or cosmology .",
    "the corresponding density profile of the hot gas captured in these cluster halos can be reasonably well described by an isothermal , as shown by eke , navarro & frenk ( 1998 ) .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness profile reads , for such a model : @xmath13^{-3\\beta+1/2}\\ ] ] which translates into the gas density distribution : @xmath14^{-3\\beta/2 } \\label{equ : rho}\\ ] ] the is known since the early observations ( jones & forman 1984 ) to provide a good fit to the x - ray profile of galaxy clusters .",
    "however makino , sasaki & suto ( 1998 ) recently found that the gas density profiles deduced from simulations are too steep to match with the typical core radii @xmath15 derived from these x - ray observations .",
    "moreover it is well known that there are large variations , from cluster to cluster , in the observed shape parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath15 .    in this paper",
    "we want to check the regularity of the gas distribution in clusters , described by a .",
    "we selected for this study a sample of nearby clusters observed with and we unravel a relation between the core radius and the slope parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the variations of the gas density profile shape and the existence of a mass  temperature relation .",

    "the redshift range is small enough to avoid to look at major evolutionary effects within the sample and the typical cluster size for these redshifts is well matched to the pspc central field of view - mostly inside the rib structure of the instrument - or to the hri field of view .",
    "furthermore we only selected clusters whose extended emission can be fitted with an isothermal @xmath4-model , i.e. the cluster must show a clear center in the x - ray emission .",

    "[ fig : sx ] ) .",
    "all these clusters have flux greater than @xmath24 .",
    "the spectroscopic sample is @xmath25 complete at that flux limit , when compared to the complete sample derived by ebeling ( 1996 ) from the rosat all - sky survey .",

    "if instead the density profile continuously steepens , the @xmath4 value obtained from the fit will increase with the outermost radius used in the fit ( see for instance the numerical simulations of navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) and as a result probably also the derived core radius . moreover",
    "the magnitude of these effects will depend on the accuracy of the approximation , which is likely to vary from cluster to cluster .",
    "all together this could induce a spurious correlation between the derived parameters , similar to the one observed , i.e .",
    "an apparent increase of @xmath4 with @xmath15 .    to see if this a serious issue we first investigated how the @xmath4@xmath15 relation is affected by the size of the region used for the fit .",
    "we can first compare a and b. we also derived the relation for the half sample of the 13 clusters with the largest @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is the maximum radius at which the x - ray emission is detected with a significance greater than @xmath27 .",
    "second we investigated if the relation is sensitive to the quality of the fit obtained with the .",
    "for this purpose we selected the clusters with the lowest reduced @xmath28 and derived the corresponding @xmath4@xmath15 relation .",

    "the largest discrepancy is actually seen between a and b , i.e if one includes or not the central excess region in the fit .",

    "we added poisson noise to the images and treated these artificial clusters in the same way as our real data and fit the isothermal @xmath4-model to them .",
    "the intrinsic values for @xmath4 and @xmath15 always lie well within the @xmath34-errors of the fit results of the simulated clusters images .",
    "thus , the fit procedure is correct and could not introduce a spurious correlation .",
    "as already discussed above , only two clusters could be affected by the finite instrument psf , namely a780 and a1991 . for the others ,",
    "the psf effects are of the same order than the statistical uncertainties or smaller . excluding these two clusters from the fit changes the results of @xmath29 and @xmath30 by less than @xmath35 .",

    "there is no significant variation in the overall photon distribution when excluding obvious sources : the countrate is flat over the whole field of view of the corresponding detector .",
    "this also validates our implicit assumption of a flat background in the fov .",
    "a perfect similarity between the density profiles is ruled out by the variation of @xmath4 from cluster to cluster . on the other hand the correlation found between the two shape parameters of the density profile",

    "let us first assume a relation between @xmath4 and @xmath15 . at the specific radius @xmath30 the slope is equal to @xmath43 , where @xmath29 is the normalisation factor of the parabolic relation .",

    "[ fig : alphastat ] . the `` average '' slope ( top panels ) and the `` relative dispersion around the mean '' , defined as the spread normalised to the average value ( bottom panels ) are plotted as a function of radius ( left ) for the whole sample and scaled radius ( right ) for the spectroscopic subsample .",

    "for instance , at 2.5 mpc the bi - weight mean slope is 1.96 and the bi - weight relative spread is 17% , very close to the corresponding values for @xmath45 : 1.98 and 18% respectively . at these large radii",
    "the bi - weight mean and dispersion are smaller than the classical estimators , reflecting the non - gaussian @xmath4 distribution which presents a tail at high values ( see sect  [ sec : var ] ) .",
    "these general properties hold both for a and b. they do not depend on the choice of the radial coordinates ( physical or scaled radius ) . however , there are some quantitative differences between the corresponding data sets .",
    "the relative dispersion of the slope @xmath38 is higher for the b than for the a at all radii .",
    "this may result in part from the larger uncertainties on @xmath4 and @xmath15 , which introduce extra scatter .",
    "using the scaled radii instead ( fig .  [ fig : alphastat ] bottom - right panel ) , the relative dispersion of @xmath5 for b decreases .",
    "the minimum dispersion , about 9% , is similar for a and b in this case .",
    "this further supports the idea that it is better to work with scaled coordinates , in agreement with the results of sect.[sec : bestfit ] .",
    "furthermore the bi - weight dispersion for model b now becomes slightly smaller than the dispersion for the model a , beyond the region where the dispersion is minimal ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is more satisfactory since the model b should be a better fit to the data at large radii as model a is expected to introduce extra scatter . from now on we will only work in scaled coordinates .",
    "the mean slope value is smaller at low radii ( the density distribution is flatter on average ) and higher at high radii ( steeper density distribution ) for the b than for the a ( fig .",

    "it is natural to define a standard profile : this density profile follows a in scaled coordinates with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we recall that the cluster physical radius scales as @xmath65 .",

    "we also plotted the mass profile derived from the numerical simulations of evrard , metzler & navarro ( 1996 ; hereafter emn96 ; table 5 ) .",
    "the isothermal yields lower values but the discrepancy decreases with radius and is less than @xmath86 around @xmath87 .",

    "recent observations with asca suggest that the temperature does decrease with radius , although the uncertainties on the temperature profiles are still large ( markevitch 1998 ) . to illustrate the impact of such a temperature gradient we considered the composite projected temperature profile derived by markevitch ( 1998 , figure 7 ) from a sample of bright clusters .",
    "this profile is steeper than most of the profiles derived from available simulations ( markevitch 1998 ) and thus is likely to give an upper limit on the influence of a temperature gradient , at least up to @xmath91 the limit of the observations .",
    "we found that the shape of the projected temperature profile , @xmath92 , can be well approximated by a polytropic model with an index of @xmath93 , a normalisation factor @xmath94 and our mean density profile ( @xmath95 , @xmath63 ) : @xmath96^{-\\frac{3\\beta}{2}\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)}\\ ] ] assuming that the observed temperatures correspond to the emission weighted mean temperatures along the line - of - sight , it is easy to show that the radial temperature profile , @xmath97 , also obeys the same polytropic law with a higher normalisation factor , about @xmath86 higher for the parameters we derived .    for a polytropic gas , the temperature logarithmic slope @xmath98 ,",
    "entering the hydrostatic equation ( eq .  [ equ : mass1 ] ) , is simply related to the corresponding density slope : @xmath99 the corresponding mass profile , plotted on fig .",

    "the differences are drastic : at @xmath104 the isothermal estimate is 1.7 times higher than the estimate using the polytropic model .",
    "whereas in the isothermal case we deduce a mass profile shallower than found in numerical simulation ( emn96 ) , the mass profile is now slightly more peaked than the theoretical one . we must however emphasize that the temperature profile used is based on an extrapolation of the data beyond @xmath91 .",
    "we have studied the shape of the surface brightness profiles of a sample of clusters covering a large variety of morphological types .",
    "the surface brightness distribution in the rosat band hardly depends on temperature and can be directly translated into the gas density distribution .",
    "although the gas density profiles of the clusters are not perfectly similar , our quantitative analysis gives evidence for structural regularity :    * we found converging evidence that there is a scaling radius in clusters which varies as @xmath105 .",
    "the surface brightness profiles appear more similar once the physical radii are scaled .",
    "the @xmath4core radius relation is tightened and the scatter of the density profile slopes is reduced .",
    "however the small range in temperature and redshift of our sample precludes any definitive conclusion , in particular on the exact variation of the scale radius with @xmath17 .",

    "the bi - weight dispersion of the logarithmic slope @xmath54 at a given radius is less than @xmath69 . at the virial radius",
    "the logarithmic slope is close to @xmath107 .",
    "its distribution reflects the distribution of this parameter , which has a bi - weight dispersion of only @xmath108 but presents a tail of rare high values .",
    "the scatter is minimal at @xmath109 where @xmath110 with a gaussian distribution .",
    "this minimum is related to the correlation between @xmath53 and @xmath4 .",
    "these results at @xmath109 are insensitive to the exact treatment of a possible central excess when fitting the profiles .",
    "as the gas evolves in the potential of the dark matter it is unlikely that such regularity in the gas density profile shape can be observed without a comparable regularity in the dark matter profiles .",
    "similarity of the dark matter profiles is naturally expected in hierarchical clustering scenario ( teyssier , chize & alimi 1997 ; navarro , frenk & white , 1997 ) and our results therefore give support to it .",
    "however , the gas density is not the sole tracer of the gravitational potential .",
    "if a universal profile for the dark matter is responsible for the similarity of the x - ray profiles , one also expects that the temperature profiles have similar shapes . both numerical simulations ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; emn96 ) and",
    "recent x - ray observations ( markevitch 1998 ) indicate that this is probably the case .",
    "our results are consistent with a scaling radius which goes as @xmath105 as expected if clusters form at constant overdensity .",
    "however our sample is too small to exclude other scaling laws as , for instance , the slight variation of overdensity with mass obtained by navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) . + similarity breaking in the x - ray properties of clusters is expected if non adiabatic processes play an important role in the evolution of the gas .",
    "these include radiative cooling and possible heating by galactic winds .",
    "radiative cooling is known to be more important in the cluster core where the cooling time , which scales as the gas density , is shorter .",
    "the presence of cooling flows of various strengths most probably explains the variation we observe in the density profiles below @xmath111",
    ". the large scatter could be either due to intrinsic variation in the initial gas density in the core , and thus in the cooling time , or to variation in the cooling flow `` age '' .",
    "the first explanation is unlikely in view of the observed quasi - similarity of the scaled emission measure profiles at large radii .",
    "let consider perfectly similar clusters obeying the assumptions used in the scaling of the profiles .",
    "the mean density of clusters in a given redshift range is a constant ( formation at fixed overdensity ) and since the gas mass fraction does not vary from cluster to cluster , the mean gas density is also a constant . as the density profiles are similar in shape , the central density is also constant and so is the cooling time",
    ". no major break of similarity in the core compared to external regions is thus expected , if clusters have the same `` age '' .",
    "the very large scatter observed in the core properties thus favors a scenario where cooling flows are recurrent phenomena that are periodically erased by strong mergers , a natural feature of hierarchical clustering ( fabian 1994 ) . in that case",
    "the observed variety of core properties in the cluster population would naturally reflect the statistics of the formation process via merger events .",
    "non gravitational heating , such as extra energy inputs by galactic winds , is thought to play an important role in the icm physics . in `` pre - heating '' scenarios , early winds",
    "add roughly a constant entropy to the system and thus affect cooler clusters more strongly , hence breaking the similarity law .",
    "the main expected effect of these winds is to inflate the gas distribution .",
    "preheating scenarios can thus explain the observed steepening of the @xmath112@xmath17 and size - temperature relations relative to the similarity scaling ( arnaud & evrard 1998 , mohr & evrard 1997 , cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1998 ) .",
    "further support to this scenario was recently given by ponman , cannon & navarro ( 1998 ) who showed that the entropy of cool systems is indeed higher than what can be achieved through gravity alone .",
    "they consistently put into evidence similarity breaking in the surface brightness profiles of clusters : cooler clusters have systematically shallower profiles than hotter systems .",
    "the regularity we found in the gas density profiles beyond the core does not contradict such results .",
    "our spectroscopic subsample comprises relatively hot clusters .",
    "our quantitative study simply shows that non gravitational heating is negligible above k@xmath113 .",
    "this is in agreement with the quantitative deviations from similarity laws observed in clusters .",
    "the gas entropy at @xmath114 plotted by ponman , cannon & navarro ( 1998 ) as a function of cluster temperature levels off from the similarity law only below @xmath115  kev .",
    "similarly the variation of the structure parameter @xmath116 , which characterises the concentration of the gas distribution and plays a role in the steepening of the @xmath112@xmath17 relation , has been studied by arnaud & evrard ( 1998 , figure 2 ) .",
    "an increase with temperature has been noted but the effect is again stronger below @xmath117 kev .",
    "the existence of such a `` threshold '' around @xmath118 kev clearly favors scenarios with constant entropy inputs . in turn",
    "it shows that the outer regions of hot clusters are good tracers of purely gravitational processes .",
    "+ the mean gas density profile we derived is shallower than found in cdm simulations without winds . for instance navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , table 2 )",
    "found a mean core radius @xmath119 and a mean @xmath4 of @xmath120 , while eke , navarro & frenk ( 1998 , table 3 ) derived for a low @xmath121 universe average values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "if pre - heating is negligible in our spectroscopic subsample other effects can explain the difference .",
    "first the transfer of entropy from the dark matter to the gas , which has been invoked to explain the segregation between these two components ( eke , navarro & frenk 1998 ; see also teyssier , chize & alimi 1997 ) , may be larger than predicted in the simulation .",
    "we can also speculate that the dark matter distribution itself is actually less concentrated , as , for instance , expected if some hot dark matter is present ( see also below ) . + the gas structural variations throughout the cluster population are small beyond @xmath7 but depend on the radius considered .",
    "the logarithmic slope @xmath54 of the density profile presents a minimum spread at @xmath58 .",
    "this scatter then increases with radius and some clusters present large asymptotic slopes compared to the mean asymptotic slope .",
    "the , used in our study , is reasonably accurate to estimate both the gas density distribution and total mass distribution , as shown by the hydrodynamic simulations of schindler ( 1996 ) or emn96 .",
    "however , by fitting such a model to simulated galaxy clusters , these last authors found that it introduces an extra - scatter in the total mass estimate and that this scatter increases with radius .",
    "we probably see the same effect here . in the hydrostatic isothermal",
    ", the logarithmic slope of the density profile is directly linked to the total mass . for a given dark matter profile ,",
    "scatter in the gas density slope estimate can be introduced by i ) errors in the measure due to the background determination and statistical errors ; ii ) departure from a spherically symmetric for the gas distribution due to imperfection of the model , bimodality , ancient mergers , and high eccentricities ; iii ) departure from the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the first and third effects are expected to be larger in the outer regions . on the contrary",
    ", the signal to noise is very high in the region around @xmath109 and the gas density slope , which is the derivative of the profile at that radius , is tightly constrained .",
    "this probably explains why the scatter in the slope estimate is minimum there and why the derived slope value is insensitive to the exact model used to fit the data ( model a or b ) . in conclusion",
    "the observed variation of the scatter with radius is more likely an artifact due to the modeling of the data , rather than the direct consequence of similar variations in the dark matter profiles .",
    "the slope at @xmath58 is almost the same for all clusters .",
    "since , in the , it depends on both @xmath4 and core radius , the values of these two parameters are correlated throughout the cluster population , as we did observe .",
    "this very correlation between @xmath4 , that controls the outer slope , and @xmath124 , that controls the core size , may indicate that the best model to fit the data is not the two parameter but some other model , involving only one shape parameter ( scaling with the virial radius ) .",
    "+ as a result of the small scatter on @xmath54 , the spread in the scaled mass profiles derived from the hydrostatic isothermal is small .",
    "the uncertainty on the dark mass profile , deduced from the hydrostatic equation , is dominated by the systematic uncertainty on the temperature gradients , rather than by the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles .",
    "the radius at which the scatter of the gas logarithmic slope is lowest is most likely in the region in which the gives the most accurate result on the total mass of clusters .",
    "it is also in the region in which temperature gradients are not expected to play a large role , as indicated both by numerical simulations ( e.g. emn96 ) and by the observed temperature profiles ( see previous section ) .",
    "we thus propose the @xmath16@xmath17 ( @xmath39@xmath17 ) relation , we derived at @xmath109 ( eq .  [ equ : masskt ] ) from the hydrostatic isothermal , as a reference test point for numerical simulations .    in this relation the mass scales classically as @xmath125 .",
    "the normalisation at @xmath109 is however @xmath126 lower than found in the numerical simulations of emn96 , whereas these authors did not observe any significant bias at that radius in the isothermal estimate .",
    "one can speculate again that the dark matter profile is in fact shallower than in cdm simulations , as expected if some hdm is present .",
    "however the discrepancy could also indicate that the temperature spatial variations or bulk motions and residual velocity dispersion of the gas are higher than expected . in that case",
    "the hydrostatic isothermal equation underestimates the real mass .",
    "large velocity fields are naturally associated with recent formation or accretion .",
    "therefore their properties should strongly depend on the specific history of each individual cluster and the corresponding velocity profiles are expected to present a high relative scatter .",
    "if large kinetic energy is common in the cluster population , it would thus be surprising that the gas density profiles remain similar . in conclusion",
    "we think that the regularity of the gas density profiles supports the validity of the hydrostatic equation . on the other hand",
    "quasi - similar temperature profiles corresponding to large temperature gradients could well be present .",
    "it thus is essential to accurately measure the temperature profiles of large sample of clusters to establish firmly the normalisation of the @xmath16@xmath17 relation and the shape of the dark matter profile",
    ". this will be soon possible with xmm and axaf .",
    "we are very grateful for useful discussions with hans bhringer , jean - pierre chieze and alain blanchard .",
    "dmn is supported via an exchange program between the cnrs and the mpg .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ."
