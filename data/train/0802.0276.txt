    "<S> at a critical finite chemical potential and low temperature qcd undergoes the chiral restoration phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the folklore tradition is that simultaneously hadrons are deconfined and there appears the quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that it is possible to have confined but chirally symmetric hadrons at a finite chemical potential and hence beyond the chiral restoration point at a finite chemical potential and low temperature there could exist a chirally symmetric matter consisting of chirally symmetric but confined hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> if it does happen in qcd , then the qcd phase diagram should be reconsidered with obvious implications for heavy ion programs and astrophysics .    </S>",
    "<S> it is generally believed that chiral and deconfinement phase transitions in qcd coincide and hence beyond the semi - circle in the @xmath0 plane one obtains a deconfining and chirally restored matter . at zero temperature and density the t hooft anomaly matching conditions </S>",
    "<S> require that in the confining phase chiral symmetry must be broken in the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is no such a restriction at a finite chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> typically models that give us information about the phase structure in qcd are of the nambu and jona - lasinio type . </S>",
    "<S> these models are not confining , however , and consequently there is no basis to conclude that above the chiral restoration point at finite chemical potential one obtains a chirally symmetric and deconfining quark matter .    </S>",
    "<S> recently mclerran and pisarski presented qualitative large @xmath1 arguments showing that at reasonably large chemical potential and low temperature there might exist a confining but chirally symmetric phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this suggestion is in conflict with the naive intuition that once the hadrons are confined chiral symmetry should be broken . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate that it is not so and that it is possible to have confined but chirally symmetric hadrons at finite density and low temperature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there exists only one known manifestly chirally - symmetric and confining model in four dimensions that is solvable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model can be considered as a generalization of the 1 + 1 dimensional t hooft model , that is qcd in the large @xmath1 limit . </S>",
    "<S> once the gauge is properly chosen in 1 + 1 dimensions the coulomb interaction becomes a linear confining potential . </S>",
    "<S> then this potential properly represents gluonic degrees of freedom in 1 + 1 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> it is postulated that there exists a linear confining potential of the coulomb type in four dimensions either . </S>",
    "<S> this model represents a simplification of large @xmath1 qcd in four dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the model is exactly solvable .    </S>",
    "<S> consider first chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac operator for the dressed quark is @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the bare dirac operator . parametrising the self - energy operator in the form    @xmath4 , \\label{se}\\ ] ]    where functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are yet to be found , the schwinger - dyson equation for the self - energy operator in the rainbow approximation , which is valid in the large @xmath1 limit for the instantaneous interaction , is reduced to the nonlinear gap equation for the chiral angle @xmath7 ,    @xmath8    where    @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the fourier transform of the linear confining potential with the string tension @xmath11 with a proper infrared regularisation . </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath12 i.e. the quark self - energy , are divergent in the infrared limit , which implies that the single quark can not be observed and the system is confined . </S>",
    "<S> however , the infrared divergence cancels exactly in the gap equation so this equation can be solved directly in the infrared limit . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral symmetry breaking is signalled by the nonzero quark condensate and by the dynamical momentum - dependent mass of quarks    @xmath13    the dynamical mass is finite at small momenta and vanishes at large momenta . </S>",
    "<S> both these quantities were first obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and repetedly reconfirmed in all subsequent works on this model . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value of the quark condensate is @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we are in position to include into this model a finite quark chemical potential @xmath15 at zero temperature . denoting the fermi momentum of quarks as @xmath16 one has to remove from the integration in the gap equation all quark momenta below @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> since they are pauli - blocked . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to what is done within the njl type models or within the t hooft model @xcite . at </S>",
    "<S> the critical quark chemical potential one observes a chiral restoration phase transition , as depicted in fig . 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> what crucially distinguishes this model from the njl model is that the system is still confined , even in the chirally restored phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the self - energy integral @xmath6 is still infrared - divergent , even when the chiral angle @xmath7 and dynamical mass @xmath17 identically vanish . </S>",
    "<S> hence the single quark is removed from the spectrum at any chemical potential .    to demonstrate this explicitly </S>",
    "<S> one has to solve the bethe - salpeter equation for the quark - antiquark bound states applying the quark green function obtained from the gap equation . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared divergence of the single - quark green function cancels exactly in the color - singlet quark - antiquark system @xcite and the bound state mesons are finite and well defined quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum below the critical chemical potential is similar to the one previously obtained in the vacuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum exhibits approximate restoration of the chiral symmetry in excited hadrons , for details we refer to @xcite and for a review to ref . @xcite .    the spectrum above the critical chemical potential , i.e. for @xmath18 , is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this spectrum is qualitatively different . </S>",
    "<S> all the states are in _ exact _ chiral multiplets . though the chiral symmetry is manifestly restored in the vacuum , one observes _ </S>",
    "<S> finite - energy well defined hadrons_. obviously the mass generation mechanism in these hadrons has nothing to do with the chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum and is not related with the quark condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the mass generation mechanism for these chirally symmetric hadrons is similar to the high - lying states in the chiral symmetry broken phase .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that it is possible to have a confining but chirally symmetric matter consisting of chirally symmetric hadrons at finite density . </S>",
    "<S> whether such a chirally symmetric but confining phase exists in qcd or not is still an open question , but if it does , then it will imply dramatic modifications of the qcd phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> it will also have significant implications for astrophysics : the interactions of these chirally - symmetric hadrons can be only of short - range as they decouple from the goldstone bosons and their weak decay rate is quite different since their axial charge vanishes @xcite . </S>"
