    "strong and broad line emission is a common feature of quasar spectra in the optical and uv bands . however , since multi - color quasar selection at high redshift in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "2000 ) is mostly based upon the presence of the ly@xmath3 forest and lyman break ( e.g. , richards et  al .",
    "2002 ) , the sdss can also effectively select high - redshift quasars with weak or no emission lines .",
    "about 90 such weak - line quasars ( wlqs ) at high redshift have been found with  rest - frame equivalent widths of ( e.g. , fan et  al .",
    "1999 , 2006 ; anderson et  al .  2001",
    "; collinge et  al .  2005 ; diamond - stanic et  al .",
    "2009 , hereafter ds09 ) .",
    "some of these objects show a hint of weak ly@xmath3 emission but no other lines ; others are completely bereft of detectable emission lines even in high - quality spectra .",
    "high - redshift sdss quasars show an approximately log - normal distribution of  rew with a mean of @xmath5    ( ds09 ) .",
    "the wlqs constitute @xmath6 negative deviations from the mean , and there is no corresponding population with @xmath6 positive deviations .",
    "the majority of these high - redshift wlqs are radio quiet ( @xmath7 ;  is the slope of a nominal power law between 5  ghz and 2500    in the rest frame ; see  [ xray ] for a full definition ) .",
    "wlqs have mainly been studied at high redshifts due to the fact that the ly@xmath3 forest enters into the sdss spectroscopic coverage for quasars at @xmath8 .",
    "however , there is no apparent reason to believe that these objects should not also exist at lower redshifts .",
    "indeed , a few apparent analogs of wlqs at lower redshifts have been found serendipitously over the past @xmath9 years ; e.g. , pg  1407 + 265 ( mcdowell et  al .  1995 ; ) , 2qzj21543056 ( londish et  al .  2004 ; ) , and phl  1811 ( leighly et  al .  2007ab ; ) . as a byproduct of a systematic survey for optically selected bl  lacertae objects ( hereafter bl lacs ) in sdss data release  7 ( dr7 ; abazajian et  al .",
    "2009 ) , plotkin et  al . ( 2010a ) discovered about 60 additional radio - quiet wlq candidates at @xmath10 for which all emission features have .",
    "these objects are perhaps the first sdss counterparts of the previously identified high - redshift sdss wlqs . following the nomenclature that has been established by previous work on wlqs ( e.g. , shemmer et  al .",
    "2009 ) , we define `` high redshift '' as @xmath8 and `` low - redshift '' as @xmath11 , because wlqs are selected with different approaches for these redshift ranges ( see above ) .",
    "although wlqs are rare , their exceptional characteristics constitute a challenge to our overall understanding of quasar geometry and physics , especially the quasar broad emission - line region ( belr ) .",
    "analogously , physical insights have been gained by investigating other minority populations with exceptional emission - line or absorption - line properties , such as narrow - line seyfert  1 ( nls1 ) galaxies and broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars . therefore , extensive studies of the multi - band properties of wlqs should have scientific value .",
    "there are several candidate explanations for the physical nature of wlqs .",
    "their uv emission lines may be weak due to an `` anemic '' belr with a significant deficit of line - emitting gas ( e.g. , shemmer et al .",
    "it has also been speculated that wlqs may represent an early stage of quasar evolution in which an accretion disk has formed and emits a typical continuum , but belr formation is still in progress ( e.g. , hryniewicz et  al .",
    "2010 ; liu & zhang 2011 ) .",
    "the weak uv emission lines may also be a consequence of a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which lacks high - energy ionizing photons .",
    "this soft sed may be a result of unusual accretion rate .",
    "for example , an extremely high accretion rate might produce a uv - peaked sed ( e.g. , leighly et  al . 2007 ) . in this scenario , high - ionization lines , like",
    ", should be suppressed relative to low - ionization lines like h@xmath4 . however , shemmer et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) estimated the normalized accretion rates , @xmath12 , of two high - redshift wlqs via near - infrared spectroscopy and found their accretion rates were within the range for typical quasars with similar luminosities and redshifts .",
    "alternatively , a combination of low accretion rate and large black hole mass may lead to a relatively cold accretion disk that emits few ionizing photons .",
    "laor & davis ( 2011 ) predicted a steeply falling sed at @xmath13  for quasars with cold accretion disks , and such an sed was observed in the wlq sdss  j0945 + 1009 by hryniewicz et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "high - energy ionizing photons ( including ) may be heavily absorbed before they reach the belr .",
    "wu et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) studied a population of  weak quasars with unusual uv emission - line properties like those of  ( weak and highly blueshifted high - ionization lines , weak semi - forbidden lines , and strong uv fe emission ) .",
    "all of their radio - quiet  analogs were found to be  weak by a factor of @xmath14 on average .",
    "these objects also show a harder average  spectrum than those for typical quasars which suggests the presence of absorption .",
    "analogs appear observationally to be a significant subset ( @xmath15 ) of wlqs .",
    "the existence of a class of quasars with high - ionization `` shielding gas '' covering most of the belr , but little more than the belr , could potentially unify the  analogs and wlqs via orientation effects ( see  4.6 of wu et  al .",
    "the shielding gas would absorb high - energy ionizing photons before they reach the belr , resulting in weak high - ionization emission lines .",
    "when such a quasar is observed through the belr and the shielding gas , a  analog would be seen ; when it is observed along other directions , an  normal wlq would be observed .",
    "another possibility is that instead of being intrinsically weak , the uv emission lines of wlqs could in principle be diluted by a relativistically boosted uv / optical continuum as for bl  lac objects .",
    "however , this scenario is not likely for most wlqs .",
    "shemmer et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that the x - ray properties of high - redshift wlqs are inconsistent with those of bl  lac objects .",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence of strong optical variability or polarization for these wlqs ( see ds09 ; meusinger et  al .",
    "the uv - to - infrared seds of high - redshift wlqs are also similar to those of typical quasars , while the seds of bl  lac objects are much different ( ds09 ; lane et  al .",
    "2011 ) . nevertheless , it is possible that the population of bl  lac objects has a small radio - quiet tail ( e.g. , plotkin et  al .",
    "2010b ) and that a small fraction ( @xmath16 ; see lane et  al .",
    "2011 ) of the general wlq population may be bl  lac objects .",

    "our closely related science goals are the following : ( 1 ) enable comparison of the broad - band seds of wlqs to those of high - redshift wlqs , typical radio - quiet quasars , and bl  lac objects ; ( 2 ) provide basic constraints upon spectral properties via band - ratio analysis and joint spectral fitting ; ( 3 ) clarify if there is broad - band sed diversity among wlqs ; and ( 4 ) allow reliable planning of future long , spectroscopic observations .    in  [ sample ]",
