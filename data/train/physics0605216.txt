    "high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) is a process in strong - field physics that occurs when the non - perturbative driving of an electron by an external field makes it leave its parent atom or molecule , propagate in the field and finally when the electron is steered back to its origin , recombine under the emission of a high - energy photon  @xcite .",
    "the process is coherent , so the result of the interaction is the production of high - frequency coherent radiation . the emitted signal can be used to create coherent uv or xuv pulses , and this radiation may then , e.g. , in fundamental science be utilized to probe ultrafast attosecond electron dynamics ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "as compared to atoms , diatomic molecules possess additional degrees of freedom , namely the nuclear separation and the orientation with respect to the laser field .",
    "studies of hhg from the h@xmath1 molecular ion  @xcite along with the molecules n@xmath0 and o@xmath0  @xcite show that the extra parameters of the molecules give rise to additional effects on the harmonic spectrum .",
    "there are two reasons why this complex behavior for molecules is of interest : ( i ) the extra parameters available for manipulating hhg from the molecules may be useful tools for controlling the intensity of the harmonics .",
    "( ii ) the fact that the harmonic spectrum contains features reminiscent of the molecular structure means that the emitted signals provide a way to study the nuclear motion and attosecond electron dynamics of the source of the high - harmonic radiation  @xcite .",
    "the complete theoretical modeling of hhg is computationally very challenging . in _",
    "ab initio _ approaches the time - dependent schrdinger equation has to be propagated in a box much larger than is the case for strong - field ionization studies since in the former case one has to make sure that the electronic wave packet does not engage with an absorbing boundary .",
    "additional complications come from the subsequent propagation of maxwell s equations in the generating medium , and in any case going beyond an effective one - electron model , or other reduced dimensionality models , seems impossible in the foreseeable future .",
    "these complications underline the importance of developing accurate approximate theories .",
    "in particular for molecules , such models , which should be relatively inexpensive to evaluate , are of interest since investigations aiming , e.g. , at an increased degree of control of the harmonic production , require a set of evaluations for different bond - lengths and orientations with respect to the field . in this paper",
    "we present one such theory .",
    "we provide a model to calculate the angular dependence of the harmonic signal from a single diatomic molecule of arbitrary orientation with respect to the laser field .",
    "in particular we include the effect of nuclear motion ( vibration ) , and we test the accuracy of the model by comparison with experiments .",
    "high - harmonic generation from diatomic molecules has already been considered in an extension of the lewenstein model  @xcite in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work depletion from the initial state was considered but the nuclear motion was ignored .",
    "recently , the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) for hhg in diatomic molecules subject to ultrashort laser pulses was presented , again ignoring nuclear motion , but combined with a careful saddle - point analysis and a discussion of the gauge problem  @xcite . here , we are concerned with the response to a monochromatic field , and in parallel with the conventions in the theory of strong - field ionization , we will refer to our theory as the length gauge version of the molecular sfa for hhg .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] we present the theory for hhg from diatomic molecules in monochromatic linearly polarized laser fields . section  [ calcdet ] contains some calculational details . in sec .",
    "[ sectionresults ] we show the hhg yields for n@xmath0 and o@xmath0 as a function of the orientation of the molecules with respect to the laser polarization , and compare with experimental measurements . by discussing hhg signals from the isotopes h@xmath0 and d@xmath0",
    ", we also see how a difference in nuclear mass affects the harmonic spectrum .",
    "the paper ends with a summary and a conclusion in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "appendix  [ appendixa ] contains a discussion of the momentum space wave function of a molecule in the single - active - electron ( sae ) approximation .",
    "in our treatment of the hhg from molecules , we extend the atomic model of ref .",
    "@xcite , and include notions of nuclear motion .",
    "we consider the case , where the laser pulse contains several cycles such that a floquet approach is suitable .",
    "as we shall see below when we compare with experimental results , even for probe pulses of 50 fs  @xcite and 35 fs  @xcite duration this turns out to be an accurate approximation .",
    "hence , using the coulomb gauge and the dipole approximation , a laser field with frequency @xmath2 and period @xmath3 is described by the vector potential @xmath4 . the electric field , @xmath5 , is then @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 with @xmath8 [ atomic units , @xmath9 , are used throughout unless indicated otherwise ] .",
    "the harmonic generation is determined by the dipole moment @xmath10 where the dipole operator is defined by @xmath11 with @xmath12 the polarization vector of the field , and where @xmath13 is the solution to the @xmath14-electron schrdinger equation for the diatomic molecule @xmath15",

    "it is clear , that in order to obtain the dipole moment , we need a solution of eq .  .",
    "the state @xmath22 is determined by using the description of the laser - molecule system given in ref .",
    "here nuclear motion is modelled within the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation , and , assuming negligible electron - electron correlation , the electrons are put into orbitals obtained from hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations .",
    "consequently , the interaction of the molecule can be treated in the sae approximation , where the active electron is the electron in the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) .",
    "we write @xmath22 as a superposition of the field - free state of the molecule and final states , where the active electron is excited to the continuum .",
