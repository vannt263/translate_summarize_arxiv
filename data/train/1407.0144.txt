    "entanglement , a concept introduced in quantum theory nearly eighty years ago by schrdinger @xcite , is one of the main traits of quantum theory ; for some it is even its _ weirdest feature _ @xcite . since the publication of the seminal gedanken experiment by einstein , podoslky , and rosen ( epr ) in their famous 1935 paper @xcite and the appearance of the first comments about it the very same year @xcite",
    ", innumerable theoretical discussions and experiments related to this subject have appeared .",
    "arguably the most relevant contribution to this discussion has been the introduction , now fifty years ago , of the now well - known bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "one of these bell - like inequalities , the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite , which will be used in this work , is the most commonly used one in experiments @xcite .",
    "originally , bell s inequalities were considered for composite systems made up of two separate subsystems , i.e. , two subsystems propagating along different directions that had interacted in the past .",
    "for instance , the two subsystems can be each one of the two photons generated by means of the nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) , when an intense pump beam interacts with the atoms of a noncentrosymmetric nonlinear crystal @xcite .",
    "entanglement can reside in any of the degrees of freedom that characterize each of the photons , with being polarization the most common . in this case ,",
    "one of the quantum states that allows a maximum violation of the chsh inequality can be written as @xmath0 |\\text{vac } \\rangle$ ] , where @xmath1 designates the creation operator of a photon propagating along direction @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) with polarization @xmath4 , similarly for @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the vacuum state .",
    "however , correlations of a nature similar to the ones existing between physically separated photons can also exist considering different degrees of freedom of a single system .",
    "therefore , bell s inequalities can be used as well to characterize these correlations existing between different parts of a single system . the key point",
    "to consider regarding bell s inequalities in this scenario is the capability to perform independent measurements in any of the degrees of freedom involved . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a single photon was generated in the quantum state @xmath7 |\\text{vac } \\rangle$ ] , which violates a bell - like inequality involving two degrees of freedom ( polarization and path ) .",
    "bell - like inequalities can be also used to characterize beams containing many photons , i.e. , intense beams , coherent or not . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors make use of coherent beams whose electric field reads @xmath8 $ ] and use a chsh inequality to characterize their coherence properties in one of the two degrees of freedom involved , i.e. , polarization or the spatial shape .",
    "entanglement , as the inseparability of degrees of freedom , has also been considered @xcite as a fundamental tool to address and shed new light on certain characteristics of classical fields , by applying analysis and techniques usually restricted to entanglement in a quantum scenario .    here",
    "we intend to move further into this analogy and show experimentally that one can generate tunable entanglement between two degrees of freedom of a single photon , going from the generation of coherent correlations to incoherent ones . for the single - photon case ,",
    "the control of the degree of entanglement between degrees of freedom is fully equivalent to tuning the first - order coherence @xcite of one of the degrees of freedom involved , in full analogy with the relationship existing between the degree of entanglement between separate photons and the first - order coherence of one of the photons that forms the pair .",
    "different types of quantum states provide different results in the measurement of the chsh inequality .",
    "this notwithstanding , for any quantum state with any degree of first - order coherence or purity , we demonstrate that the results of a bell s measurement obtained using different degrees of freedom of a single photon , are the same as when using the properties of separate photons .    in our experiments",
    "we make use of single photons where the two degrees of freedom involved are the polarization ( horizontal and vertical linear polarizations ) and spatial modes ( two spatial modes with orbital angular momentum index @xmath9 ) .",
    "the orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states allow for a relatively simple experimental generation , filtering , detection , and control @xcite .",
    "these states are characterized by the index @xmath10 , which can take any integer number , and determines the azimuthal phase dependence of the mode , which is of the form @xmath11 .",
    "each mode carries an oam of @xmath12 per photon .",
    "the feasibility to generate entangled states in the laboratory using polarization and spatial modes with oam is greatly facilitated by the use of the so - called q - plates @xcite : liquid crystal devices which couple together polarization and orbital angular momentum and allow the generation of states that have been recently exploited in fundamental quantum mechanics @xcite , quantum communications @xcite , and metrology @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , nagali et al . generated a single - photon quantum state with the oam and polarization degrees of freedom with high purity .",
    "karimi et al .",
    "@xcite used this same state to demonstrate the violation of the chsh inequality .",

    "paired photons are generated in a @xmath13-mm - long @xmath14-barium borate ( bbo ) nonlinear crystal by means of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "we choose a type - ii source , where the photons generated have orthogonal ( horizontal and vertical ) polarizations in order to generate a polarization - entangled photon pair by postselection with a beam splitter and a coincidence detection .     in a houng - ou - mandel ( hom )",

    "the output light at @xmath17 nm traverses an optical system with five dichroic mirrors and a short - pass filter to filter out the remaining @xmath16-nm light .",
    "a spatial filter tailors the spatial shape of the pump beam to obtain the sought - after gaussian beam profile .",
    "we use a @xmath18-mm focal distance lens to obtain a pump beam with @xmath19-@xmath20 m beam waist that is focused in the middle of the nonlinear crystal . a smaller beam waist",
    "would increase efficiency of the spdc process ; however , the spatial walkoff in the bbo crystal impedes tighter focusing , because it would also introduce harmful spatial distinguishability between the generated photons .",
    "the down - converted photons are collimated with a @xmath19-mm focal distance lens .",
    "another filtering system , formed by two dichroic mirrors , a long - pass filter , and a band - pass filter , removes the residual pump light at @xmath17 nm .",
    "different group velocities result in slightly different spectra of the orthogonal polarizations , thus mixing the polarization and frequency properties of the photons .",

    "concepts such as purity and degree of entanglement or concurrence can be used to describe coherent and noncoherent correlations between properties of a single system .",
