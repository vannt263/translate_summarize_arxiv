    "a first order phase transition from hadronic to exotic matter phases may proceed through the nucleation of droplets of the new phase .",
    "the formation of droplets of quark matter @xcite and antikaon condensed matter @xcite in neutrino - free neutron stars ( ns ) was studied using the homogeneous nucleation theory of langer @xcite .",
    "droplets of new phase may appear in the metastable nuclear matter due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the droplets of the stable phase with radii larger than a critical radius survives and grows if the latent heat is transported from the surface of the droplet to the metastable state .",
    "this heat transportation occurs through thermal dissipation @xcite and viscous damping @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the onset of antikaon condensate influences the shear viscosity of ns matter composed of neutron(n ) , proton(p ) , electron(e ) and muon(@xmath1 ) that can interact by strong or electromagnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "effect of shear viscosity on the nucleation of the antikaon condensed matter was recently been studied @xcite in deleptonised ns , after the neutrinos are emitted . here",
    "we investigate the contribution of neutrinos to the shear viscosity and nucleation of antikaon condensates . in the pns where the temperature is of the order of a few 10s of mev , neutrinos",
    "are trapped because their mean free paths under these conditions are small compared to the radius of the star . on the other hand , they are very effective at transporting both heat and momentum because their mean free paths are orders of magnitude larger than that for other particles .",
    "we adopt the homogeneous nucleation theory of langer @xcite to calculate the thermal fluctuation rate for a first order phase transition from the charge - neutral and beta - equilibrated nuclear matter to @xmath2 condensed matter in a neutrino - trapped pns .",
    "the thermal nucleation rate is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the change in free energy required to activate the formation of the critical droplet .",
    "@xmath5 , is the prefactor of which @xmath6 is the statistical prefactor and @xmath7 $ ] is the dynamical prefactor . here",
    "@xmath8 is the surface tension for the surface separating the two phases , @xmath9 is the correlation length for kaons , @xmath10 is the difference of the enthalpy of the two phases , @xmath11 the thermal conductivity , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the shear and bulk viscosity respectively .",
    "the free energy is maximum at this critical radius given by @xmath14 finally the thermal nucleation time is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the volume of the core , where the thermodynamic variables is assumed to remain constant .    to calculate shear viscosity in the pns , which is mostly contributed by the neutrinos @xcite",
    ", we consider the scattering of neutrinos @xmath17 where n = n , p , e. shear viscosity of neutrinos due to scattering is calculated using the coupled boltzmann transport equation @xcite . for the deleptonised ns",
    ", total shear viscosity is given by @xmath18 as in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in order to calculate the shear viscosity and critical radius ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "we need to know the eos , that we construct at finite temperature using the relativistic mean field model @xcite .",
    "the interaction between baryons is mediated by the exchange of scalar ( @xmath8 ) and vector ( @xmath20 ) mesons .",
    "this picture is consistently extended to include the kaons .",
    "we use the parameter sets of gm1 model @xcite for nucleon - meson coupling constants .",
    "the kaon - meson coupling constants are determined using quark model , isospin counting rule and the real part of @xmath2 potential depth , that we take as -160 mev in our calculation @xcite .",
    "the total shear viscosity is shown as a function of normalised baryon density for different temperatures in fig .",
    "we consider two cases i)the deleptonised ns matter , where the total shear viscosity has contribution from all the species such as n , p , e and @xmath1 ; ii)for the neutrino - trapped pns matter ( lepton fraction @xmath21 ) , where the major contribution comes from neutrinos . in both the cases shear viscosity decreases with rising temperature .    the prefactor @xmath22 is plotted as a function of temperature for pns in fig . 2 and is compared when it is approximated by @xmath23 from dimensional analysis . here",
    "we find the shear viscosity term changes the prefactor by a large order of magnitude compared to @xmath23 approximation .",
    "this difference is much more pronounced in pns compared to ns @xcite .    in fig .",
    "3 we display the nucleation time as a function of temperature for a set of values of surface tension at a fixed baryon density for lepton - trapped pns matter and find that both the droplet radii and the thermal nucleation time strongly depend on the surface tension .",
    "nucleation may not occur in pns for surface tension < 30 mev @xmath24 as the radius of droplet is less than the correlation length ( @xmath25 5 fm ) .",
    "we approximate that the radius of the droplet should be greater than @xmath9 in this calculation@xcite . for ns case",
    ", nucleation is observed to be possible for @xmath26 mev @xmath24 @xcite . larger viscosity there leads to larger value of t which might melt the condensate .",
    "finally in fig .",
    "4 we compare the results of thermal nucleation time taking into account the effect of shear viscosity in the prefactor with that of the prefactor approximated by @xmath23 . for pns we displayed the results for @xmath27 and @xmath28mev @xmath24 .",
    "we find the result of the @xmath23 approximation a few orders of magnitude higher than those of our calculation .",
    "these results demonstrate the importance of including the shear viscosity in the prefactor of eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the calculation of thermal nucleation time .",
    "we already obtained similar results for ns matter @xcite .",
    "also , it may be mentioned that nucleation of antikaon condensates is possible if @xmath29 .",
    "that is possible for pns with @xmath30 mev @xmath24 .",
    "we have investigated the role of shear viscosity on the thermal nucleation rate for the formation of a critical droplet of antikaon condensed matter . for this",
    "we considered a first order phase transition from the nuclear to antikaon condensed matter in pns .",
    "we have seen that the droplet radii increase with increasing surface tension .",
    "we also compare the nucleation times for ns and pns and found that nucleation is possible for a lower value of surface tension @xmath31 20 mev @xmath24 in ns while it may be possible only for higher value in pns ( @xmath32 30 mev @xmath24 ) ."
