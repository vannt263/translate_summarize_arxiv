    "in principle we can use the same technique as above for any @xmath109 using ( [ bluesky ] ) .",
    "this would give explicit - though quite complicated - expressions for @xmath127 for simplicity we use only the fact that we have calculated the leading term of ( [ bluesky ] ) to obtain main term and sharp error estimates for ( [ alternative ] )    to do this we need the following : let @xmath128 have radius of convergence @xmath129 .",
