    "as there are insufficiently many observations available in the extreme failure set @xmath7 to use standard statistical methods , extreme value theory is needed to estimate the failure probability @xmath8 .",
    "the basic idea of multivariate extreme value theory is to assume that the suitably standardized componentwise maxima of the observed random variables converge to a non - degenerate limit distribution .",

    "we discuss a heuristic tool to ensure this balance .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to establish the asymptotic normality of the estimator @xmath92 under conditions on the underlying distribution and the failure set which are easy to interpret and relatively simple to verify . in what follows we outline how to achieve this objective .",
    "recall that , in our asymptotic framework , the failure set @xmath93 must become more extreme in the sense that it moves in the north - east direction as the sample size @xmath49 increases to ensure that it contains at most a few observations . to make both coordinates comparable , we standardize the marginals using @xmath57 and assume that @xmath94 is essentially an increasing multiple of a fixed set @xmath95 . that way",

    "more precisely , we assume that for different sample sizes the failure sets are obtained from one fixed set @xmath96 in that there exist constants @xmath97 tending to @xmath75 such that @xmath98 note that from the analog to where @xmath87 is replaced with @xmath99 one obtains @xmath100 ( see lemma [ lemma : termvi ] for a precise proof of the assertion @xmath101 ) . hence the model constants @xmath99 determine at which rate the failure probabilities tend to 0 .",

    "for this set , we may use the approximation @xmath109 where the random transformation @xmath104 of the marginals is defined by @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 check that by one has @xmath113",
    "( cf.lemma [ lemma : marginalapprox ] ) . using the homogeneity of @xmath37",
    ", we will thus break the estimation error into several parts as follows : @xmath114 it will turn out that , under suitable conditions , part iv dominates all the other terms .",
    "its asymptotic behavior is largely determined by the asymptotics of the marginal estimators if @xmath37 is sufficiently smooth .    under very weak conditions on the set @xmath95",
    ", we will show that the terms @xmath115 and @xmath116 are negligible , if @xmath108 is defined suitably .",
    "if @xmath117 is bounded and bounded away from 0 , then using methods from empirical process theory the second term can be shown to be asymptotically negligible .",
    "part @xmath118 is a bias term which is negligible if @xmath99 is sufficiently large ( depending on the rate of convergence in ) .",
    "similarly , the term @xmath119 , that equals @xmath120 for @xmath121 , describes a bias term which is asymptotically negligible if both the approximation and the marginal approximation @xmath122 are sufficiently accurate .",
    "an estimator related to @xmath92 has been suggested and analyzed by de haan and sinha ( 1999 ) in a much more restrictive framework . in particular , it has been assumed that the same number @xmath123 of largest order statistics is used for both marginal fits , which is inefficient if the gpd approximation ( cf .   below ) is less accurate for one of the marginal distributions .",
    "likewise , the flexibility of the estimator is increased in the present paper by allowing that the blow - up factor @xmath87 deviates from the unknown model constant @xmath99 , while de haan and sinha ( 1999 ) used a consistent estimator of @xmath99 , which was made identifiable by fixing some point on the boundary of @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , the shape of the failure set considered by de haan and sinha is restricted .",
    "e.g.  the case @xmath124 ( in our notation ; cf .  condition ( q2 ) below ) is ruled out by condition ( 2.9 ) of that paper .",
    "the model assumption @xmath125 for some function @xmath126 and sequences of normalizing constants @xmath127 and @xmath128 seems quite restrictive and unnatural , because it allows the failure set to tend towards the `` north - east '' only by a linear scaling of both marginals .",
    "this parametrization does not fit well to extreme value theory if the extreme value indices are not positive , which is usually the case in environmetrics , arguably the most important field of application of our theory .",
    "even more troublesome is the fact that by assumption ( 1.5 ) of de haan and sinha ( 1999 ) the failure set is described in terms of the number @xmath123 of largest order statistics that is picked by the statistician .",
    "hence the model parametrization depends on the statistical procedure used to analyze the model , which makes it extremely difficult to interpret .    finally ,",
    "while the influence of each marginal transformation is clearly separated in the description of the limiting distribution in our main theorem [ theo : main ] , in theorem 4.1 of de haan and sinha ( 1999 ) the marginal parameters are seemingly intermingled .",
    "therefore , the generalization of the present results to higher dimension is much more straightforward than those of de haan and sinha ( see the discussion at the end of section 2 ) .",
    "an alternative to our genuinely multivariate estimator can be constructed by the so - called structural variable approach if the failure set is of the form @xmath129 for some known function @xmath42 and threshold @xmath130",
    ". then one may apply techniques from univariate extreme value theory to the pseudo - observations @xmath131 , @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "coles ( 2001 ) ,  8.2.4 and page 156 , or bruun and tawn ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "however , even for this class of failure sets , an analysis of the dependence structure between the two components of the observed vectors is of independent interest , and it seems more natural to use the same approach for model fitting and for the estimation of quantities like failure probabilities . moreover , often one wants to estimate the failure probability for several different sets ( e.g. , to find the cheapest construction to ensure a certain level of safety ) ; in this case it is both more efficient and more natural to use estimators in a unified framework as considered in the present paper .    in the multivariate approach ,",
    "coles and tawn ( 1994 ) and bruun and tawn ( 1998 ) used parametric models for the dependence structure in the closely related problem to estimate a parameter defining a failure set such that the corresponding failure probability equals a given value .",
    "however , usually there is no physical reason for such parametric models . by using them",
    "nevertheless one trades a modeling error , that is difficult to assess , for an estimation error , which can be quantified at least asymptotically ( see theorem [ theo : main ] below ) .",
    "indeed , davison ( 1994 ) suggested in the discussion to coles and tawn ( 1994 ) that for sufficiently large sample sizes a nonparametric approach may be advisable .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the assumptions used in the present paper rule out that the exponent measure @xmath37 concentrates on the coordinate axes ( i.e. , here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are assumed asymptotically dependent in the sense of multivariate extreme value theory ) . in the case of",
    "asymptotic independent coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 , consistency of an analogous estimator for the failure probability was proved by draisma et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , while its asymptotic normality was established by mller ( 2008 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we first introduce and discuss in detail the framework in which we then prove asymptotic normality of our estimator of the failure probability .",
    "moreover , we propose a consistent estimator of the limiting variance and derive an asymptotic confidence interval . in section 3",
    "we apply the theory to the motivating example given at the beginning . in this context",
    ", we also discuss the roles of @xmath86 and @xmath87 and propose a heuristic approach for choosing those numbers .",

    "secondly , we used the ( slightly old - fashioned ) classical approach to establish asymptotic equicontinuity instead of the often more elegant approach via bracketing numbers ( see van der vaart and wellner ( 2000 ) , theorem 2.11.9 ) , because the same approximation error of order @xmath581 in ( d1 ) always enters the upper bound on @xmath582 , thus impeding the calculation of bracketing numbers for radii of smaller order .",
    "as @xmath584 , the left - hand side of is non - negative with expectation @xmath585 where we have used ( d1 ) and ( s2 ) .",
    "now assertion follows from lemma [ lemma : snstarapprox ] and the proof of corollary [ cor : termivvapprox ] .          with @xmath588 as in lemma [ lemma : marginalapprox ]",
    ", we define for @xmath380 $ ] @xmath589 according to de haan and ferreira ( 2006 ) , theorem 2.3.6 and 2.3.7 one can choose @xmath590 as a multiple of @xmath591 and @xmath592 .",
    "thus , for @xmath593 defined in the proof of lemma [ lemma : marginalapprox ] @xmath594 where in the last step we have used , and the potter bound for the regularly varying function @xmath595 ( de haan and ferreira ( 2006 ) , prop .",

    "we conclude that @xmath596 check that the first remainder term is of smaller order than @xmath597 by condition ( i ) of lemma [ lemma : marginalapprox ]",
    ". moreover , for @xmath373 , and again condition ( i ) of lemma [ lemma : marginalapprox ] imply @xmath598 while for @xmath29 this convergence follows from the conditions ( i ) and ( iii ) of lemma [ lemma : marginalapprox ] , and for @xmath14 it is obvious from condition ( i ) .",
    "this shows that @xmath599 is indeed well defined with @xmath600 uniformly for @xmath380 $ ] .",
    "notice that this representation is of similar type as the approximation derived in lemma [ lemma : marginalapprox ] with all leading terms equal to 0 ( though in the case @xmath373 the second remainder term has a slightly different form ) .",
    "therefore , we may proceed as before to conclude @xmath601 where the last equality follows from lemma [ lemma : marginalapprox ] ( i ) ( cf .",
    "corollary [ cor : termivvapprox ] ) .",

    "first note that , similarly as for @xmath92 , one obtains the representation @xmath604 with @xmath605 , @xmath606 and @xmath607 .",
    "thus lemma [ lemma : marginalapprox ] ( with @xmath87 replaced by @xmath608 ) yields the approximation @xmath609 now the very same arguments as used in the analysis of @xmath92 show that @xmath610 together with an analogous approximation for @xmath611 and our assumption on @xmath232 , we may conclude that @xmath612 in the last step we have used the fact that , on the range of integration , @xmath613 is continuous and bounded by a multiple of @xmath614 ( cf .  ) , so that the integrand of the outer integral can easily be bounded by an integrable function and convergence follows by the dominated convergence theorem .",
