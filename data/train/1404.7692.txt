    "let @xmath0 be a pseudoconvex domain in @xmath1 .",
    "the following lower bound for the bergman kernel in terms of the pluricomplex green function was recently proved in @xcite using methods of the @xmath2-equation : for any @xmath3 and @xmath4 one has @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 the constant in is optimal for every @xmath8 , for example we have the equality if @xmath0 is a ball centered at @xmath9 .",
    "the behaviour of the right - hand side of as @xmath10 seems of particular interest .",
    "for example for @xmath11 we easily have @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the logarithmic capacity of the complement of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "this gave another proof in @xcite of the suita conjecture @xcite @xmath14 originally shown in @xcite .",
    "our first result is a counterpart of in higher dimensions :    [ thm1 ] assume that @xmath0 is a bounded hyperconvex domain in @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the azukawa indicatrix of @xmath0 at @xmath9 .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize this to a bigger class of domains . combining with theorem [ thm1 ] and approximating pseudoconvex domains by hyperconvex ones from inside we obtain the following multidimensional version of the suita conjecture :    [ thm2 ] for a pseudoconvex domain @xmath0 in @xmath1 and @xmath4 we have @xmath17    possible monotonicity of convergence in theorem [ thm1 ] is an interesting problem .",
    "we state the following :    [ conj1 ] if @xmath0 is pseudoconvex in @xmath1 then the function @xmath18 is non - decreasing on @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "we will show the following result :    [ tn1 ] conjecture [ conj1 ] is true for @xmath11",
    ".    the main tool will be the isoperimetric inequality .",
    "in fact , the proof of theorem [ tn1 ] will show that conjecture [ conj1 ] in arbitrary dimension is equivalent to the following _ pluricomplex isoperimetric inequality _ :",
    "@xmath20 for bounded strongly pseudoconvex @xmath0 with smooth boundary ( by @xcite the left - hand side is then well defined ) .",
    "the following conjecture would easily give an affirmative answer to conjecture [ conj1 ] :    [ conj2 ] if @xmath0 is pseudoconvex in @xmath1 then the function @xmath21 is convex on @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know if it is true even for @xmath11 .    in @xcite the question",
    "was raised whether for @xmath11 a reverse inequality to @xmath22 holds for some constant @xmath23 .",
    "we answer it here in the negative :    [ ann ] assume that @xmath24 and let @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath26    it is nevertheless still plausible that there is an upper bound for the bergman kernel in terms of logarithmic capacity which would give a quantitative version of the well known fact that for domains in @xmath27 whose complement is a polar set the bergman kernel vanishes .",
    "the opposite implication is also well known and the quantitative version of this is given by .",
    "there is however a class of domains for which the upper bound does hold :    [ ub ] for a @xmath27-convex domain @xmath0 in @xmath1 and @xmath4 one has @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath0 is convex then the estimate holds with @xmath30 and if it is in addition symmetric with respect to @xmath9 then we can take @xmath31 .",
    "by theorems [ thm2 ] and [ ub ] for @xmath27-convex domains the function @xmath32 defined for @xmath4 with @xmath33 , satisfies @xmath34 one can easily check that @xmath35 is biholomorphically invariant . if @xmath0 is pseudoconvex and balanced with respect to @xmath9 ( that is @xmath36 implies @xmath37 for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the unit disk ) then @xmath40 .",
    "in fact a symmetrized bidisk @xmath41 is an example of a @xmath27-convex domain ( see @xcite ) with @xmath42 .",
    "by @xcite we have @xmath43 and by @xcite @xmath44 therefore @xmath45 and @xmath46    especially interesting is the class of convex domains .",
    "it is well known that then the closure of the azukawa indicatrix is equal to the kobayashi indicatrix @xmath47 this follows from lempert s results @xcite , see @xcite . for such domains",
    "the inequality @xmath48 was proved in @xcite and seems very accurate .",
    "it is in fact much more difficult than for @xmath27-convex domains to compute an example where one does not have equality .",
    "this can be done for some convex complex ellipsoids :    [ ell ] for @xmath49 and @xmath50 define @xmath51 then for @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , one has @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "for example , theorem [ ell ] gives the following graphs of @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 :        one can check numerically that the highest value of @xmath56 is attained for @xmath57 , @xmath59 at @xmath60 , and is equal to @xmath61    using @xcite one can compute numerically @xmath62 for the ellipsoid @xmath63 where @xmath50 .",
    "this has an advantage compared to the ellipsoid given by because using holomorphic automorphisms we can easily show that all values of @xmath35 are attained at @xmath64 , where @xmath53 .",
    "here is the graph of @xmath62 for @xmath65 equal to 1/2 , 2 , 8 , 32 , and 128 :        one can compute that the maximum converges to @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "this is the highest value of @xmath35 for convex @xmath0 we have been able to obtain so far",
    ". it would be interesting to find an optimal upper bound for @xmath35 when @xmath0 is convex , how close to 1 it really is .",
    "we suspect that it is attained for the ellipsoid @xmath68 at a point of the form @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath0 be convex and @xmath4 be such that @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath40 if and only if there exists a balanced domain @xmath70 ( not necessarily convex ) and a biholomorphic mapping @xmath71 such that @xmath72 .",
    "it was recently shown in @xcite that the equality holds in if and only if @xmath0 is biholomorphic to @xmath73 for some closed polar subset @xmath74 , this was also conjectured by suita in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s1 ] we show theorems [ thm1 ] and [ tn1 ] .",
    "upper bounds for the bergman kernel are discussed in section [ s2 ] , we prove proposition [ ann ] and theorem [ ub ] there .",
    "finally , in section [ s3 ] the case of convex complex ellipsoids is treated .",
    "without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath75 .",
    "write @xmath76 and for @xmath3 set @xmath77 we can find @xmath78 such that @xmath79 . then @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in our case by @xcite",
    "the function @xmath82 is continuous on @xmath1 and @xmath83 is equal to @xmath84 .",
    "therefore @xmath85 and by the lebesgue bounded convergence theorem @xmath86 -37pt    set @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "it is enough to show that if @xmath8 is a regular value of @xmath89 then @xmath90 . we have @xmath91 the co - area formula gives @xmath92 and therefore @xmath93 by the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath94 the isoperimetric inequality gives @xmath95 and we obtain @xmath90 .",
    "we first show that the reverse estimate to is not true in general .",
    "since @xmath96 , @xmath97 , is an orthogonal system in @xmath98 and @xmath99 we have @xmath100 and @xmath101 to estimate @xmath102 from above consider the mapping @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the principal branch of the logarithm defined on @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "we have @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "also @xmath108 and therefore @xmath109 combining this with we get .",

    "we may assume that @xmath75 .",
    "we claim that it is enough to show that @xmath111 indeed , since @xmath112 is balanced we would then have @xmath113 the proof of will be similar to the proof of proposition 1 in @xcite . choose @xmath114 and by @xmath115 denote the complex line generated by @xmath116 .",
