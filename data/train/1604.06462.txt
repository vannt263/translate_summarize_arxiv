    "@xmath12 is characterized by a sharp , exponential cutoff that is commonly interpreted as the signature of strongly suppressed cooling in massive halos , as can be achieved ( albeit under rather extreme conditions ) by thermal conduction , high energy expulsion of gas via superwinds , or feedback from active galactic nuclei ( see benson et al .",

    ", @xmath12 is usually parameterized as a power - law , although significant uncertainties remain as to the exact value of its slope , @xmath13 , and its possible dependence on environment and galaxy type . even whether a single , luminosity independent , slope is an adequate description of the data is still subject to debate ( see reference below and , for the mass function , li & white 2009 ; baldry et al 2012 ) .    in the local group , where milky way satellites as faint as @xmath14 mag can be detected ( e.g. mcconnachie 2012 ; laevens et al .",

    "with a gravitating mass of @xmath49  ( durrell et al .",

    "not surprisingly , it has long been a prime target for studies of the luminosity function in cluster environments .",
    "the landmark study of sandage , binggeli & tammann ( 1985 ) , which was based on the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc , binggeli , sandage & tammann 1985 ) , reached a high level of completeness for galaxies as faint as @xmath31 and mean surface brightness within an effective radius of @xmath51 mag arcsec@xmath52 . surveying an area of 140 deg@xmath0",
    ", these authors found a faint - end slope of @xmath53 when including galaxies of all hubble types , and as steep as @xmath54 when the sample was restricted to just early types ( regular and dwarf ellipticals ) .",
    "however , virgo has not been immune from the controversies noted above , and subsequent investigations , some of them reaching fainter magnitudes but at the expense of a reduced spatial coverage , found quite discordant slopes , ranging widely from @xmath55 to @xmath56 ( impey et al . 1988 ; phillipps et al .",
    "1998 ; trentham & hodgkin 2002 ; trentham & tully 2002 ; sabatini et al . 2003 ; rines & geller 2008 ) .",
    "such wide range in the measured slopes can arise , at least in part , from technical issues , such as the detection techniques , the criteria adopted in the determination of cluster membership , the completeness corrections , or even the methodology used and the assumptions made in fitting the faint end slope ",
    "all of which differ amongst the various studies .",
    "however , slope differences could also have a physical origin , for instance they could reflect true variations of the luminosity function as a function of stellar population ( for surveys conducted in different bands ) , environment ( reflected in the field size / location ) , and/or galaxy mass and morphological mix ( which can be sampled differently according to the survey s depth , as well as field placement ) .",
    "the ngvs offers a unique opportunity to explore the virgo luminosity function using a homogeneous , deep ( reaching @xmath57 mag at 50% completeness ) , high resolution ( 055 median seeing full - width - half - maximum in the @xmath58band ) , panchromatic ( @xmath59 to @xmath60band ) dataset covering the entire cluster ( 104 deg@xmath61 ) , with the added benefit of a well understood completeness function .",

    "if they are not , then the simulations presumably also predict the infall halos to be completely disrupted , and therefore not to contribute to the present - day halo mass function , in which case ucds should not be included in the comparison .",
    "a second conclusion is that , because ucd numbers appear to scale with the underlying total gravitating mass ( liu et al .",
    "2015a ) , including ucds will likely lead to an increase in the apparent environmental dependence of the faint - end slope , with steeper slopes associated with deeper potential wells .",
    "we plan to test this hypothesis in a future contribution that uses the galaxy sample over the full cluster .",
    "whether the simulations predict the total disruption of their progenitors halo or not , ucds can still be used to provide a rough estimate of the expected number of disrupted halos under our initial assumption : i.e. , that the original ucd progenitor magnitude can be inferred from the nuclear - to - total galaxy magnitude relation of present - day early - type galaxies .    in the mass range spanned by the ucd progenitors in our sample , @xmath249",
    ", there are 92 ucds in the core of virgo , and 49 galaxies , of which 33 are nucleated . at a minimum , therefore , for every galaxy - hosting halo that survives to the present time , we expect 92/49 = 1.9 halos to have been disrupted  in fact , since ucd can only originate from nucleated galaxies , that estimate is likely closer to 3 ( 92/33 ) . in other words , in this scenario , @xmath260% of all infall halos that reach maximum mass after entering the cluster core will not survive to the present day .",

    "( 2015 ) find that the disruption rate of satellites is largely independent on halo mass down to the resolution of the simulations ( @xmath264 ) , while since the observed fraction of nucleated to non - nucleated galaxies decreases as a function of magnitude ( at the low - mass end ) , our assumptions necessarily imply that the disruption rate should increase at low masses .",
    "we stress , however , that our rough calculation assumes that nucleated and non - nucleated galaxies share the same spatial distribution and orbital properties , an hypothesis whose validity is still under active investigation ( binggeli et al .",

    "2016b ) .      finally , it is interesting to explore the possible contribution of ucds and their progenitors to the globular cluster population in the virgo core .",
    "if ucds are the surviving nuclei of tidally stripped galaxies , then it is expected that the globular cluster population associated with those galaxies now resides in the core of the cluster .",
    "indeed , it has been recognized for some time that the accretion and disruption of low - mass galaxies is likely one of the most important mechanisms by which galaxies assemble their globular cluster systems ( e.g. , ct et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ; beasley et al . 2002 ; jordn et al . 2004 ; tonini 2013 ) . using the extensive ngvs imaging data in the virgo core region , which allows us to assemble complete and homogenous samples of galaxies , ucds and globular clusters in this environment",
    ", we explore this scenario by noting that the globular cluster ` specific frequency ' @xmath265  defined as the number of globular clusters @xmath266 normalized to a @xmath267band magnitude @xmath268  varies as a function of galaxy luminosity , but is @xmath269 ( albeit with large scatter ) in the magnitude range occupied by the presumed progenitors of the existing ucds ( see , e.g. , peng et al . 2008 or",
    "harris et al . 2013 ) .",
    "for this choice of @xmath270 , the ucd progenitors are expected to have contributed a total of roughly @xmath271 globulars to the core of the cluster .",
    "most of these clusters come from the brightest progenitors : e.g. , a @xmath272 mag progenitor will have contributed @xmath273 globulars , while a @xmath274 mag progenitor is expected to have contributed only @xmath275 to 3 globulars . in addition , most accreted clusters are expected to belong to the blue globular cluster population ( ct et al .",
    "1998 ; peng et al . 2006",
    "; tonino 2013 ) .",
    "there is a second way in which the stripping of galaxies can affect the present - day population of globular clusters ( or objects identified as such ) .",
    "as mentioned above , a faint magnitude cutoff of @xmath5 was imposed on the ucd population selected from the ngvs ( liu et al .",
    "this was solely out of necessity : i.e. , one of the criteria used in selecting ucds is their larger size ( compared to globulars ) , and sizes can not be measured reliably fainter than @xmath276 mag using ngvs data ( liu et  al .",
    "fainter objects are therefore excluded _ a priori _ when selecting ucds , but they do exist in the core region and , when detected , would invariably be classified as globular clusters .",
    "the progenitors of such faint ucds are expected to be fainter than the progenitors of the ucds identified by liu et al ( 2015a ) . to estimate their numbers",
    ", we can proceed in two separate ways .",
    "the first , probably incorrect method , is to assume that the luminosity function of the ucd progenitors and galaxies has a schechter - like form , with a slope of @xmath252 ( see table 1 ) , all the way down to the 50% completeness limit of the ngvs , @xmath57 mag .",
    "the integral of this luminosity function over the range @xmath277 mag then yields the total number of existing galaxies plus disrupted ucd progenitors : @xmath278 , where the error reflects the uncertainty in the slope of the luminosity function . from this number ,",
    "we need to subtract the number of existing galaxies in the same magnitude range : correcting the number of observed galaxies ( 297 ) for completeness gives 384 galaxies that have survived to the present day .",
    "this implies that @xmath279 galaxies have been disrupted . using the relation between nuclear and galaxy magnitude from snchez - janssen et al .",
    "( 2016b ) , the nuclei of galaxies in the @xmath280 mag range have magnitudes @xmath281 .",
    "this falls squarely in the magnitude range dominated by globular clusters , whose luminosity function can be described as a gaussian with turnover magnitude @xmath282  mag and dispersion @xmath283 mag ( see , e.g. , villegas et al .",
    "the progenitors of these galaxies are also expected to contribute their globular cluster populations to the core of virgo .",
    "the globular cluster specific frequency is not well quantified for early - type galaxies in this magnitude range ( e.g. georgiev et al . 2010 ) , but assuming @xmath284 would lead to a total of @xmath285 additional globular clusters .",
    "as already noted , the above arguments are likely incorrect at some level , since there is no reason to believe that the combined luminosity function of ucd progenitors and galaxies is well described by a schechter function all the way down to the completeness limit of the survey  a factor 150 beyond the magnitude of the progenitor of the faintest ucd currently detected .",
    "in fact , there are reasons to believe that this luminosity function is _ not _ well described by a schechter function .",
    "all ucd progenitors are , by definition , nucleated , but the present - day fraction of nucleated galaxies decreases dramatically as galaxies become fainter , falling to @xmath286% at @xmath57 mag , the 50% completeness limit of the survey .",
    "if the same nucleation fraction applies to galaxies that have been disrupted ( which it might not ) , then we would expect the luminosity function of the ucd progenitors to have a bell - shaped distribution , following the galaxy luminosity function at the bright end and declining sharply at the faint end .",

    "the red curve is meant to represent the luminosity function of nucleated galaxies that have been disrupted . under the assumption",

    "liu et al . ( 2015a ) , meanwhile , found from their colors that ucds appear to be more closely associated with the blue , rather than the red , globular cluster subpopulation .",
    "using a double gaussian fitted to the observed color distribution allows us to divide the observed globular cluster sample into blue and red components , for a total of 7300 and 2800 objects , respectively .",
    "it then follows that , in this picture , @xmath307% of the blue globular clusters were formerly associated with ( mostly bright and nucleated ) galaxies that have been disrupted .",

    "for each galaxy , a stellar mass - to - light ratio was then estimated as the median value of the marginalized posterior probability distribution function obtained by fitting the observed sed to the grid of synthetic models , with an uncertainty equal to half the interval between the 16th and 84th percentiles ( see figure  14 ) .",
    "we note that the @xmath347 values derived in this paper differ slightly from those presented in grossauer et al .",

    "( 2015 ) , these assumptions tend to produce @xmath347 values that are biased too low .",
    "the outcome of our mcmc fitting to the resulting stellar mass function is shown in figures 15 and 16 , with parameters tabulated in table 7 . as expected , the best - fit slope of @xmath3 is virtually identical to that measured for the luminosity function  a consequence of the nearly constant mass - to - light ratio of galaxies at the low - mass end of our sample . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first measurement of the faint - end slope of the stellar mass function in the virgo cluster that is based directly on sed modeling .",
    ".2 in    it is interesting to compare the mass function in the core of virgo with that measured for field galaxies . using an sdss sample of half a million field galaxies with @xmath348 and mass @xmath349 , li & white ( 2009 ) find that a single schechter function with @xmath350 provides a reasonable representation of the data ( fitting a triple schechter function , which the authors note provides an even better description , leaves the faint - end slope virtually unchanged ) .",
    "a steeper slope is derived by baldry et al .",
    "( 2012 ) using a sample of over 5000 galaxies with @xmath351 observed as part of the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey .",
    "the authors fit a double - schechter to their mass function ; in the range @xmath352   they find a best fitting slope of @xmath353 .",
    "the authors further divide their sample in blue , star forming galaxies , and red , quiescent galaxies , and find that the former dominate at the low - mass end and are largely responsible for the steep slope measured for the combined sample .",
    "the luminosity function of the quiescent galaxies is significantly shallower , with only a hint of a steepening at the lowest masses .",
    "regardless of these differences , the field mass function appears dissimilar from the mass function of the core of virgo .",
    "fitting the virgo sample down to @xmath354   ( the approximate limit reached in the field ) yields a slope @xmath355 .",
    "although slightly shallower than estimated using the full mass range , this slope is still steeper than measured in the field by li & white ( 2009 ) or by baldry et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for quiescent galaxies ( recall that the virgo core sample is composed almost exclusively of galaxies belonging to the red sequence ) .",
    "we will comment on the environmental dependence of the virgo mass function in a future contribution using the full sample of galaxies in virgo , reaching out to one virial radius and including a larger population and late - type systems .",
    "we have used deep and homogenous @xmath1 imaging from the next generation virgo cluster survey ( ferrarese et al . 2012 ) to measure the luminosity and stellar mass functions for galaxies in the core of the virgo cluster .",
    "the analysis is based on our new catalog of 404 certain or probable cluster members found in a 3.71 deg@xmath0 ( 0.3 mpc@xmath0 ) region surrounding m87 , the galaxy at the dynamical center of the cluster ( ferrarese et al .",
    "our analysis takes full advantage of the panchromatic nature , surface brightness sensitivity and exceptional spatial resolution of the ngvs data .",
    "these allow us not only to derive accurate structural and photometric parameters , but also , and perhaps most importantly , to establish robust membership criteria .",
    "an extensive set of simulations , presented in a companion paper ( ferrarese et al .",
    "2016 ) , shows our ngvs catalog to be 50% complete at a @xmath4band magnitude of @xmath356 , which we have adopted as the limiting magnitude for our measurement of the luminosity function .",
    "applying this cutoff reduces our sample from 404 to 352 galaxies ( in the @xmath4band ) , 30% of which are new detections .",
    "the ngvs completeness limit is @xmath357 mag fainter than that of sandage et al .",
    "( 1985 ) who first characterized virgo s luminosity function using the vcc catalog of binggeli et al .",
    "additionally , the ngvs completeness limit is between @xmath358 and @xmath359 mag fainter than that of galaxy samples previously used to measure the luminosity function in this benchmark cluster .",
    "we have employed a bayesian approach that fits a schechter function to individual datapoints and their errors , thus avoiding the loss of information that can result from collapsing the data onto a histogram representation .",
    "the faint - end slope @xmath13 has always been treated as a free parameter , while separate fits were performed by first allowing @xmath132 to vary and then setting it equal to the value measured for field galaxies from sdss data ( equivalent to @xmath360 mag , smith et al .",
    "we find that although @xmath132 is not well constrained by the data , owing to the small number of bright galaxies within our sample , our measurement of @xmath13 is quite robust and insensitive to the precise choice of @xmath132 .",
    "using the same bayesian methodology , we have also provided new measurements for the galaxy luminosity function for the milky way , m31 and local group satellites .      * the faint - end slope of the luminosity function in the core of virgo is @xmath3 , which is significantly shallower than the slope of the @xmath17cdm halo mass function ( @xmath18 , springel et al 2008 ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ; han et al .",
    "this measurement refers to the @xmath4band , but the values measured in @xmath361 , down to the 50% completeness limit appropriate to each band , are all consistent with the @xmath4band measurement to within 1@xmath11 . within the core of virgo , and down to the 50% completeness limit of our survey , @xmath362 mag , the ngvs data firmly rule out slopes as steep as @xmath363 ( impey et al .",

    "* there may be some evidence for a dip in the luminosity function at @xmath364 mag and , possibly , a steepening of the luminosity function fainter than @xmath365 mag .",
    "these claims have been made before ( e.g. , sandage et al .",

    "2009 ) , although they are only marginally significant based on ngvs data .",
    "the significance of these features , as well as the question of whether the luminosity function depends on location within the cluster , will be revisited in a future paper that analyses the full sample of galaxies detected in the ngvs . *",
    "the core region contains 92 known ultra compact dwarfs ( ucds ) . under the assumption that ucds",
    "are the surviving nuclei of tidally disrupted nucleated galaxies ( an assumption we will adopt for all conclusions involving ucds ; e.g. , bekki et al .",
    "2003 ) , we have explored their possible impact on the luminosity function by adding them to the sample of `` surviving '' galaxies observed in the core region .",
    "while their inclusion definitely steepens the luminosity function , it does not increase the slope of the observed luminosity function to the point where it equals that of the subhalo mass function predicted by @xmath17cdm structure formation models if the efficiency of galaxy formation where constant across a wide range of scales . simply adding the ucd magnitudes directly from the catalog of liu et al .",
    "( 2015a ) steepens the slope to @xmath244 , while adding the magnitudes of the ucd _ progenitors _ ( estimated from the relation of nuclear - to - total galaxy magnitude from snchez - janssen et al .",
    "2016b ) increases the slope to @xmath252 .",
    "if we also correct for the expected number of disrupted _ non - nucleated _ galaxies ( and assume that the ratio of nucleated to non - nucleated disrupted galaxies is the same as observed for existing galaxies ) , then the slope steepens further , to @xmath6 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the observed ratio of ucds to galaxies in the virgo core suggests that , for every halo that hosts a galaxy that has survived to the present day , 2 to 3 halos have been tidally disrupted . *",
    "the core region contains @xmath9 11000 globular clusters , of which @xmath9 7300 belonging to the blue population .",
    "if the ucd progenitors hosted populations of globular clusters having properties ( in particular , specific frequency ) similar to those of present - day galaxies  and if the nucleation to non - nucleation fraction among disrupted galaxies is similar to that of surviving galaxies  then we estimate the disrupted galaxies to have contributed @xmath289 ucds and @xmath298 globular clusters to the virgo core .",
    "the disrupted _ nucleated _ galaxies contribute all of the ucds ( by definition ) and @xmath366% of these globular clusters ( due to the fact that the most luminous progenitor galaxies , which contain the largest number of globular clusters , are nearly always nucleated ) . in this picture",
    ", we estimate that as many as one third of the ( mostly blue ) globular clusters in the core of virgo could have originated from disrupted satellites . *",
    "only a fraction of the @xmath367 predicted ucds would be easily recognizable as such : i.e. , the census of ucds in the m87 region includes only 92 objects ( liu et  al .",
    "2015a ; see also zhang et al .",
    "2015 ) down to @xmath368 .",
    "the remaining @xmath7 ucds , which would be expected to have magnitudes in the range @xmath281 , would be classified as globular clusters . * in this scenario , we estimate that the total amount of luminosity contributed by disrupted galaxies in the core region could amount to @xmath9 85% of the luminosity of m87 , the supergiant elliptical galaxy at the dynamical center of virgo .",
    "alternatively , the luminosity associated with disrupted galaxies corresponds to @xmath9 40% of the combined luminosity of all member galaxies in the virgo core region .",
    "all in all , these calculations suggest that the @xmath9 400 galaxies we detect in the core region may represent as little as a quarter of the initial population of ( surviving plus disrupted ) galaxies in this region .",
    "* we present new luminosity function measurements for the m31 , milky way and the local group satellites using updated galaxy catalogs .",
    "these measurements have been computed using the same bayesian approach adopted for virgo ( although we apply no completeness corrections for the local group samples ) . down to the completeness limit of the ngvs ( @xmath57 )",
    ", the luminosity function of the m31 system has slope @xmath334 .",
    "the luminosity function for the milky way has a slightly shallower faint - end slope , @xmath369 , but this would likely steepen if completeness corrections  which are more severe for the milky way rather than for m31  are taken into account .",
    "overall , the luminosity function for local group galaxies is found to be @xmath339 .",
    "this is , somewhat surprisingly , only slightly shallower than that measured in the core of the virgo cluster ( a 1.7@xmath11 difference ) .",
    "* we have derived stellar masses for the virgo core galaxies by fitting their @xmath1 spectral energy distributions .",
    "the resulting stellar mass function , measured over the range @xmath370 , has a faint - end slope of @xmath371 , which is nearly identical to the luminosity functions measured in the various ngvs bandpasses .",

    "<S> we present measurements of the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass function in a 3.71 deg@xmath0 ( 0.3 mpc@xmath0 ) area in the core of the virgo cluster , based on @xmath1 data from the next generation virgo cluster survey ( ngvs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy sample  which consists of 352 objects brighter than @xmath2 mag , the 50% completeness limit of the survey  reaches 2.2 mag deeper than the widely used virgo cluster catalog ( vcc ) and at least 1.2 mag deeper than any sample previously used to measure the luminosity function in virgo . using a bayesian analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we find a best - fit faint end slope of @xmath3 for the @xmath4band luminosity function ; consistent results are found for the stellar mass function as well as the luminosity function in the other four ngvs bandpasses . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications for the faint - end slope of adding 92 ultra compact dwarfs galaxies ( ucds )  previously compiled by the ngvs in this region  to the galaxy sample , assuming that ucds are the stripped remnants of nucleated dwarf galaxies . under this assumption , </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the luminosity function ( down to the ucd faint magnitude limit , @xmath5 mag ) increases dramatically , up to @xmath6 when correcting for the expected number of disrupted non - nucleated galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the total number of ucds and globular clusters that may have been deposited in the core of virgo due to the disruption of satellites , both nucleated and non - nucleated . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that @xmath7 objects with @xmath8 mag and that are currently classified as globular clusters , might , in fact , be the nuclei of disrupted galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we further estimate that as many as 40% of the ( mostly blue ) globular clusters in the virgo core might once have belonged to such satellites ; these same disrupted satellites might have contributed @xmath9 40% of the total luminosity in galaxies observed in the core region today . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we use an updated local group galaxy catalog to provide a new measurement of the luminosity function of local group satellites , @xmath10 , which is only 1.7@xmath11 shallower than measured in the core of the virgo cluster .    based on observations obtained with megaprime / megacam , a joint project of the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) and cea / dapnia . </S>",
