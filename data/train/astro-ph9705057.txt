    "when galaxies formed and how they evolved are among the central issues of cosmology today .",
    "the traditional clue to this problem has been provided by the number count of galaxies as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "early observations in the blue band showed that the number of galaxies per unit angular area increases faster than is expected in simple models for fainter magnitude ( koo & kron 1992 , for a review ) .",
    "it has become clear , however , that the number count alone does not allow an unambiguous interpretation . over the last decade ,",
    "much effort has been expended to obtain redshift of faint galaxies ( broadhurst , ellis & shanks 1988 , hereafter bes ; colless et al . 1990 ; 1993 ; lilly , cowie & gardner 1991 ; koo & kron 1992 ; songaila et al . 1994",
    "; glazebrook et al .",
    "1995a ; lilly et al .",
    "1995 ; ellis et al .",
    "these redshift surveys have revealed , when combined with the count data , that the distribution of galaxies in the universe is much more puzzling than it looked : the excessive number of galaxies observed in the number count seemed to be most simply explained by assuming luminosity evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , koo & kron 1992 ) , but the redshift surveys have indicated that the shape of the redshift distribution appears almost as is predicted with a no - evolution model , with the normalization , however , being larger by a factor of two .",
    "simple models with all galaxies undergoing substantial luminosity evolution , which account for the steep slope of the number count , predict too many galaxies having high redshift to be consistent with the observations ( e.g. , ellis 1990 ; lilly 1993 ) ( though this seems to have been somewhat overstated ) .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to solve this problem : some authors speculated that the excess count is due to a new population of galaxies which have undergone star burst at rather low redshift ( bes ; cowie , songaila and hu 1991 ) .",
    "babul & rees ( 1992 ) and babul & ferguson ( 1996 ) interpreted this new population as dwarf galaxies from collapsed lyman @xmath12 clouds , eventually faded into galaxies making up an invisible population .",
    "some other authors have assumed a heuristic morphology - dependent luminosity evolution so that subluminous galaxies evolve fast to explain high counts while keeping the shape of redshift distribution as is in the no - evolution model , rather than introducing a new population ( bes ; lilly 1993 ; phillips & driver 1995 ) .",
    "another class of explanation invokes mergers of galaxies with a very high merging rate ( guiderdoni & rocca - volmerange 1991 ; broadhurst , ellis & glazebrook 1992 ; carlberg 1992 ) . the required rate to explain the steep slope of the @xmath4 band count is so high that a typical galaxy gains 50% of mass over the past 5 gyr .",
    "more recently , gronwall & koo ( 1995 ) suggested that the presence of an abundant non - evolving very blue dwarf population accounts for both counts and redshift data , although the meaning of this blue population is not clear to us .",
    "observational data have now accumulated for both counts and redshifts over a wide range of colours from @xmath4 to near infrared @xmath6 band , and the deepest redshift reaches beyond @xmath13 ( glazebrook et al .",
    "1995a ; songaila et al .",
    "1994 ; lilly et al .",
    "a large number of redshifts contained in the survey have enabled a direct construction of the @xmath4 band luminosity function as a function of redshift ( lilly et al .",
    "1995 ; ellis et al . 1996",
    "; see also eales 1993 ) .",
    "this prompts us to think that we already have enough data to understand the evolution of galaxies below @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , more varieties of clues have become available to understand the nature of faint galaxies .",
    "sharp images of galaxies obtained with the hst have enabled a study of morphology to @xmath5=24 mag , giving us a direct probe concerning how the faint galaxies look like ( driver , windhorst & griffiths 1995 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "1995b ; abraham et al . 1996 ; driver et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the work has shown that the fraction of irregular galaxies increases sharply with magnitude beyond @xmath15 mag .",
    "the same observations indicate that giant galaxies evolve only slowly , although they do indicate some evolution in colour , brightness and the detail of morphology .",
    "another piece of evidence that giant galaxies evolve only slowly , if at all , comes from a mg ii quasar - absorption - line selected sample ( steidel , dickinson & persson 1994 ) .",
    "the luminosity of galaxies that yield mg ii absorption lines for a quasar in their vicinity is remarkably constant both in the rest - frame @xmath4 and @xmath6 bands from @xmath16 to @xmath171 .",
    "there are also a number of observations that tell us about the content of galaxies .",
    "the information that would directly constrain the model for evolution of galaxies is the estimate of the global star formation rate at @xmath18 ( gallego et al .",
    "1995 ) and high @xmath19 ( cowie , hu & songaila 1995 ; see also madau et al .",
    "1996 for a more recent work ) from the strength of h@xmath12 or [ o ii]@xmath20 emission lines .",
    "this quantifies the inference from early observations concerning the increase of star formation activity in the past ( bes ) .",
    "yet another useful information is given by the measurement of the neutral hydrogen abundance in the universe as a function of redshift ( lanzetta , wolfe & turnshek 1995 ; storrie - lombardi , mcmahon & irwin 1996 ) .",
    "the data show clear depletion of hi gas with time , suggesting that this gas has been used for star formation .",
    "this information can be used to constrain the total volume emissivity of galaxies ( see , pei & fall 1995 ) , on which direct information is also available from galaxy observations ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) .    from accumulating observations we now have a reasonable picture for the evolution of galaxies ( fukugita , hogan & peebles 1996 ) :",
    "giant galaxies were already mature at @xmath21 and evolve only slowly lower than this redshift , whereas subluminous galaxies evolve rapidly in the same redshift range .",
    "the latter are probably young galaxies formed close to @xmath21 .",
    "it has also been speculated that most of elliptical galaxies and bulges of the spiral galaxies , which altogether we call spheroids , formed before @xmath22 , and spiral disks were assembled in the redshift range from @xmath23 to 1 .    in this paper",
    "we present a simple but quantitative model for the history of galaxies , which is broadly consistent with the observations .",
    "the model employs a population synthesis model of stars . in the traditional attempts ,",
    "galaxies are assumed to have fully assembled at an early epoch of the universe ( searle , sargent & bagnuolo 1973 ; sandage 1986 ; yoshii & takahara 1988 ) , and the star formation rates are adjusted to reproduce galaxy colours today . in our attempt it is crucial to properly build in the epoch of the formation of galaxies in the stellar population synthesis model . for this purpose",
    "we first show that one can estimate the age of the galaxies as seen today from a simultaneous consideration of the colour and gas content of galaxies with the aid of moderate assumptions on the star formation history , and infer the age of irregular galaxies and also of disks of spiral galaxies . for elliptical galaxies , and also bulges of spiral galaxies from family resemblance (",
    "both are called spheroids ) , we adopt the conventional view that they formed at high @xmath19 as argued by eggen , lynden - bell and sandage ( 1962 ) .",
    "we assume that the number of galaxies is conserved since they were born , and it is constrained by the local type - dependent luminosity function .",
    "we calculate the evolution of bulges and disks separately and assume delayed formation of disks and irregular galaxies .",
    "the spheroids are supposed to follow the passive evolution to now .",
    "galaxies are grouped into four morphology types : e / s0 , sab , sc , and sdm - irr which is simply referred to as irr in this paper ; low luminosity dwarf galaxies do not play an essential role in our argument . the mix of morphological types of galaxies is not constant , but depends on absolute luminosity .",
    "the predictions of this model are compared with the observation of the galaxy number count and the redshift distribution in @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "we do not discuss the @xmath24 band count , since we can not model reliable @xmath6- and @xmath25-corrections for this band , and @xmath24 band data are too sensitive to the detail of galaxy activity .",
    "we discuss the evolution of gas and star content of galaxies predicted in the model .",
    "through these comparisons with the observations we may conclude that the present model is reasonably well constrained for @xmath26 .",
    "the prediction for @xmath27 , however , is basically an extrapolation , and ill - constrained .",
    "a number of checkpoints are also discussed to prove or disprove the validity of the model and , more importantly , underlying assumptions taken in this paper .",
    "we do not consider the no - evolution model seriously , since it is clearly unphysical .",
    "we know that elliptical galaxies _ must _ evolve even in the absence of new star formation after the burst , since the stars in the main sequence branch continuously evolve to giants , and the total luminosity should decrease with time ( tinsley 1972 ) . this basic feature is a solid prediction of the stellar population synthesis model , although quantitative details depend on models , in particular on assumed initial mass functions . for spiral galaxies , there are more uncertainties : our model corresponds to the case where luminosity changes very little with time : the decrease of light due to evolution of stars is compensated by newly born stars formed from the gas replenished into the disk .",
    "we note that the present model is quite different from `` cdm cosmologies '' , where morphologies of galaxies change from time to time due to mergers down to low redshift ( kauffmann , guiderdoni & white 1994 ; cole et al .",
    "that is , elliptical galaxies are not quite old , but formed by collision of , for instance , two spiral galaxies at rather low redshift ( toomre 1977 ) .",
    "one of the original reasons for interest in faint galaxy counts is that it may offer a chance to test world geometry ( sandage 1961 ) .",
    "a number of attempts have been made aiming at this goal ( e.g. , yoshii & takahara 1988 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1990 ; gardner , cowie & wainscoat 1993 ; gronwall & koo 1995 ) .",
    "the reliability of the results , however , is strongly affected by the uncertainties of the model .",
    "in this paper we discuss where the predictions are reasonably robust . in particular we discuss the possibility to test the presence or absence of the cosmological constant .    in the next section",
    "we discuss how to estimate the ages of galaxies from their colours and gas content .",
    "the details of the model and input assumptions are discussed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present the predictions of the model and compare them with the observations in @xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands , and with the constraint on evolution from a mg ii quasar absorption line selected sample .",
    "the evolution of baryons in stars and in gas is also discussed .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussion and summary of the problems .",
    "the two fundamental parameters that control the evolution of the stellar population are the age of the galaxy @xmath28 and the star formation rate @xmath29 ( gyr@xmath30 ) , provided that the initial mass function is fixed .",
    "we can obtain useful information concerning these parameters by plotting galaxies in the two dimensional plane , integrated galaxy colour versus gas . in fig .",
    "1 we show a diagram for irregular galaxies plotted in @xmath31 versus @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is mass of the neutral atomic gas estimated from the integrated 21 cm hi flux , corrected for helium abundance of 25% in mass , with the aid of the formula given in the _ third reference catalogue of bright galaxies _ ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 , hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "molecular hydrogen is ignored .",
    "the data are taken from buta et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , but a very similar figure can be obtained using the data given in rc3 .",
    "the bars indicate one standard deviation of the distribution .",
    "evolutionary tracks are presented in the figure for a given @xmath29 using a conventional evolution model of galaxies , where star formation is assumed to take place at a constant rate against gas mass .",
    "for the present calculation , we adopt the closed model of arimoto & yoshii ( 1986 ) , but other models also yield similar results .",
    "the track represented by a solid line corresponds to @xmath34 gyr@xmath30 , which is the star formation rate in the solar neighbourhood , and is also consistent with the estimate for sb - sbc galaxies ( roberts 1963 ; smith , biermann & mezger 1978 ; kennicutt 1983 ; sandage 1986 ) .",
    "the ticks on the track indicate the age of galaxies , 1 , 5 , 10 and 15 gyr after star formation began , so that dashed curves represent isochronal contours .",
    "we note that the traditional model , where irregular galaxies formed as old as the universe , assumes a very low @xmath29 ( @xmath35 gyr@xmath30 , say ) in order to obtain their blue colour ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this terminating point of the @xmath37 track is indicated by an open circle .",
    "the family of evolutionary tracks indicates that one can obtain the same colour with a larger @xmath29 if the age of galaxies is younger ; the gas fraction determines the age .",
    "the data point for irregular galaxies shows that they are as young as @xmath38310 gyr and @xmath39 gyr@xmath30 , which is close to the solar neighbourhood value .",
    "the prediction of the traditional model , as presented by the open circle , is clearly inconsistent with the observation .",
    "we emphasize the large `` error bars '' , which indicate that the irregular galaxies observed today have not had a coeval formation at all , with an age spread of well over 4 to 12 gyr .",
    "one attractive feature with a larger @xmath29 , which is consistent with the value for spiral galaxies , is that it supports the validity of the schmidt law , which states that the star formation rate is proportional to the hi gas amount to some power ( schmidt 1959 ) .",
    "the approximate validity of the schmidt law with power law index close to unity is supported by an analysis of emission line features ( kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "the traditional value @xmath37 gyr@xmath30 requires an unusually strong suppression of star formation in irregular galaxies , the surface brightness of which is not necessarily very low .",
    "we do not consider intermittent star bursts , which are often invoked in the literature to account for faint blue galaxies .",
    "we consider that the star formation activity is steady and continuous at least for the majority of galaxies .",
    "the galaxies are highly gaseous shortly after their birth , and the star formation rate _ per galaxy _ can be 4 times than it is today .",
    "those galaxies are seen as if they are undergoing star burst activity .",
    "we conclude that irregular galaxies observed today formed at around @xmath21 , although some irregulars are formed as low as @xmath40 or less , and some others as high as @xmath41 .",
    "we do not mean , however , that the irregular galaxies do not form at high @xmath19 .",
    "most of the galaxies formed at higher @xmath19 , might already have been faded or accreted onto giant galaxies and they do not show up in our local sample of irregulars .      a similar analysis can be applied to disk components of spiral galaxies .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath31 versus @xmath42 plot for spiral disks , where both @xmath31 and @xmath43 are corrected for the light from bulge component by assuming average disk / bulge ratios that depend on morphology ( see section 3.1 below ) .",
    "the data are taken from rc3 .",
    "a plot is also made for irr and sd for comparison .",
    "the tracks are calculated with a closed model .",
    "this figure shows that the disks of late - type spiral galaxies are also young with ages around @xmath175 - 12 gyr allowing for a large scatter , if a slight upward shift of the data due to the neglect of h@xmath44 gas is taken into account .",
    "the plot for sa indicates that some of these might be as old as the spheroids .",
    "the age of the disk of sb - sc galaxies inferred this way is consistent with the age of the oldest disk stars ( 7.511 gyr ) estimated from nearby white dwarfs ( winget et al .",
    "1987 ; wood 1992 ) .    for bulges of spiral galaxies",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that they formed very early , @xmath45 , from family resemblance with elliptical galaxies , if they indeed formed so .",
    "the resulting picture is that spiral disks formed as intergalactic gas accreted onto preexisting bulges and star formation began in the disk at @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that spheroids ( ellipticals and bulges of spiral galaxies ) formed at high @xmath19 ( @xmath8 ) by a single short burst event .",
    "the stars have to be formed from the initially collapsing gas faster than the collapse time to avoid disk formation ( eggen et al .",
    "the duration of the burst is taken to be 0.125 gyr , i.e. , the star formation rate @xmath47 ( hereinafter the star formation rate is denoted as @xmath47 ) being effectively 40 times the solar neighbourhood value ( e.g. , sandage 1986 ) .",
    "these galaxies evolve passively after the burst .",
    "the problem inherent in the presently available stellar population synthesis models is that they do not reproduce the uv spectrum of average elliptical galaxies today .",
    "it shows a significant uv component and frequently an upturn shortward of 2000   ( bertola , capaccioli & oke 1982 ; burstein et al .",
    "1988 ) . in the models of passive evolution",
    "the uv component rapidly dies off a few gyr after the burst .",
    "the uv component of elliptical galaxies , however , plays very little role in the quantities that we discuss in the present paper .",
    "no effect is expected in the @xmath6 band until one samples galaxies above @xmath48 . in this pass band",
    "the effect is visible only in the high redshift tail of the redshift distribution at @xmath49 mag . for the @xmath5 band",
    "the effect appears only above @xmath50 , and a minor change is expected only for @xmath51 . for the @xmath4 band",
    "we expect some effect for redshifts is as low as 0.5 , but the spheroids play only a minor role in this pass band , and the presence or absence of the uv component does not change any predictions , unless elliptical galaxies are specifically selected from the sample . for this reason we can ignore the problem of the disagreement of the passive evolution model with the uv observations .",
    "distribution in the optical pass bands .",
    "a typical example is the `` lyman continuum break galaxies '' recently discovered by steidel and collaborators ( 1996 ) in a sample selected in the @xmath52 band .",
    "such observations just sample those galaxies that are dominantly controlled by the uv components of spheroids . ]",
    "we represent spiral galaxies with two morphological types , sab and sc .",
    "we assume that they consist of old spheroids and disks which formed typically at @xmath53 .",
    "we adopt for the disk components a model where gas continuously accretes onto spheroids , making spiral disks with @xmath54-folding time @xmath55 gyr ( @xmath56 is the inverse of the infall rate ) , which corresponds to @xmath53 .",
    "the star formation rate @xmath47 is set equal to the value in the solar neighbourhood , @xmath57 gyr@xmath30 , irrespective of galaxy types .",
    "we use the stellar population synthesis model of arimoto , yoshii & takahara ( 1992 ) to accommodate gas infall .",
    "this infall model gives evolutionary tracks significantly different from the ones based on a closed model shown in fig .",
    "2 for a high @xmath47 case , but the self - consistency between the input and output is maintained for ( age , star formation rate ) versus ( colour , age ) .",
    "the bulge fraction in the blue light is taken to be 0.3 for sab and 0.1 for sc in agreement with the analysis of kent ( 1985 ) after the colour transformation .",
    "we remark that we adopt here a model of disk formation exponential in time with @xmath54-folding time @xmath58 for simplicity .",
    "the formation epoch of irregular galaxies is taken to be 8 gyr back from the present for simplicity of the model , although the actual formation epoch spreads over a wide range of age .",
    "we assume a universal star formation rate , the same value as that for disks .",
    "we take the age of the universe to be 15 gyr , but only minor modifications are caused if we take it to be 13.5 gyr ( e.g. , e galaxies are slightly bluer , and evolution is a little stronger etc . ) .",
    "the hubble constant enters into our scenario only through the evolution time - scale of stars .",
    "we assume the hubble constant to have the value specified by the assumed age of the universe and the specific cosmology we consider .    .assumed history of star formation in galaxy . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]",
    "the parameters of our model are summarized in table 1 .",
    "some basic predictions for galaxy properties , bulge fraction ( input ) , @xmath59 , gas fraction , @xmath31 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 colours at @xmath18 , are presented in table 2 ( discussion is deferred to later sections ) .",
    "we use the standard johnson - morgan - cousins colour band system , unless otherwise explicitly denoted . the evolution of the light emitted by e , sc and irr galaxies is shown in fig . 3 for the rest frame @xmath4 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "spheroids follow the standard passive evolution for both pass bands .",
    "the brightening of 0.3 mag in @xmath4 between @xmath16 and @xmath63 is consistent with the observation for red galaxies in the lilly et al .",

    ", weak evolution is visible only between @xmath18 and 0.5 , only in the epoch after gas infall has ceased .",
    "the evolution between @xmath18 and 0.5 is about a half mag .",
    "( this is compared to lilly et al .",
    "1995 , who reported 1 mag evolution of @xmath65 from @xmath18 to @xmath66 ; they have not seen a change of @xmath67 above @xmath68 , which is consistent with our model ) .    below @xmath69 , the galaxies that have undergone the fastest evolution are irr , but the total increment in the @xmath4 band luminosity is only 0.8 mag between @xmath18 and 0.8 .",
    "of course , the evolution is much faster in the uv light , and the @xmath25 correction for the @xmath4 count amounts to @xmath172 mag in the same redshift range .",
    "this is almost the maximum evolution that can be attained with a conventional stellar population synthesis model .",
    "lilly ( 1993 ) and phillips & driver ( 1995 ) assumed significantly faster evolution ( @xmath70 mag between @xmath18 and 0.4 , and 2.5 mag between @xmath18 and 0.5 , respectively ) .",
    "another input to the model that deserves discussion is the local luminosity function ( lf ) .",

    "of course , these two statements are not contradictory : in our case we confine ourselves to a fixed magnitude range .",

    "1992 ) leads to a trend of decreasing redshift for fainter magnitude for redder colour bands , which however is not supported by the recent deep redshift survey ( @xmath166 ) from the keck telescope ( koo 1996 ) .",
    "more directly , the mg ii absorption - line selected sample indicates that properties of giant galaxies change very little after @xmath21 , indicating no evidence for bulk merging after this redshift .",
    "no data , however , can constrain the importance of mergers for @xmath167 . where only the count data are available , an increase in numbers and a decrease in luminosity compensate each other and modest merging does not modify the predictions . therefore",
    ", the success of the present model does not necessarily mean the absence of merging for @xmath168 .",
    "this question is still not settled .",
    "the epoch of the spheroidal formation is also a long standing problem . in our model",
    ", we simply assumed that the spheroid formation took place at a high redshift .",
    "an underlying idea for the early formation of spheroids is that stars must have formed within the collapse time and hence the first collapse of massive objects may be a suitable place for spheroid formation .",
    "the rise of the quasar population at @xmath169 to 3 may also imply that spheroids formed at least earlier than quasars get active ( rees 1995 ) .",
    "if , indeed , most of spheroids formed below @xmath170 , the light from the star formation epoch should be visible even in a @xmath171 sample .",
    "therefore , it will be particularly interesting to find spectroscopic features of those galaxies in the @xmath6 selected sample ( songaila et al . 1994 ) which have been missed in their spectroscopic follow - up . perhaps , the technique similar to that developed by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) can most efficiently be applied to such a sample . if the result excludes the possibility of these galaxies having @xmath172 , the remaining possibilities are either ( i ) they formed at very high @xmath19 , or ( ii ) the formation redshift of spheroids is not so high , and they formed at around the same time as galactic disks , i.e. , @xmath173 .",
    "we note that the baryons in spheroids amount to 2/3 ( somewhat less in case of late spheroid formation ) of total baryons frozen into stars . then , if ( ii ) is true , the integrated light from @xmath174 must be more than @xmath175 times higher than is predicted here , since star formation must have been stopped at some redshift above @xmath13 .",
    "such activity can easily be detected , e.g. , especially with use of narrow band filters selecting for h@xmath12 emission .",
    "of course , this modifies the basic assumptions taken here and hence most of the predictions .",
    "the evolution of spheroids is reasonably well understood , although quantitative details depend on models .",
    "the poorly - understood part is the uv spectrum .",
    "there are a number of speculations about the origin of the uv component observed in elliptical galaxies today , but there seems to be no consensus . in this paper we have passed over this problem .",
    "what we have discussed in this paper is the prediction that is not sensitive to the presence or absence of the uv component of spheroids .",
    "one specific case where such uv is important is seen in the high @xmath19 tails of the redshift distributions of optically selected samples , the most notable example being `` lyman continuum break galaxies '' having @xmath176 in the @xmath177 mag sample , as discovered by steidel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in this case",
    "the observability of these galaxies is completely controlled by the uv light emitted from spheroids . in the present model",
    ", we predict that the tail of the redshift distribution of @xmath177 sample does not extend beyond @xmath178",
    ". the initial burst of spheroids does not give enough a number of lyman break galaxies , unless the formation epoch is lower than @xmath169 . if , however , some star formation activities persist , e.g. , those with recycled gas , it is easy to give a sufficient number of such galaxies , without modifying any other predictions discussed in this paper .",
    "the evolution of spiral galaxies is less well understood .",
    "there are , however , a number of constraints from observations . among them , the presence and strength of high redshift tail in the redshift distribution of a @xmath4 selected sample serve as an interesting indicator for the amount of evolution of giant spiral galaxies . while it is generally agreed that the tail is not very large , it is still not settled observationally to what degree such a tail is present ( see cowie et al . 1996 ; koo 1996 ) .",
    "a very strong constraint comes from the mg ii sample , which precludes any appreciable luminosity evolution of spiral galaxies in the relevant redshift interval . on the other hand ,",
    "the cfrs survey ( lilly et al . 1995 ) does see evolution of the characteristic luminosity @xmath67 for blue , presumably spiral , galaxies by one magnitude ( such evolution is not claimed in ellis et al .",
    "1996 work , though ) . in our model",
    "these two constraints are somehow reconciled in the way that evolution is faster between @xmath18 to @xmath179 , but very slow above this redshift .",
    "this is because gas infall has almost ceased by @xmath142 , and the galaxies started to show more evolution after this redshift .",
    "such evolution constraints , if taken literally , indicate that a spiral galaxy is not a closed system , but supplied with fresh gas down to @xmath13 or less .",
    "one of the main points of the present paper is to estimate the age of irregular galaxies and introduce them as being newly formed at low redshift .",
    "they are the agent that is responsible for the steep slope of the number count in the blue bands .",
    "these galaxies are quite gaseous , and undergo very active star formation , which may be observed as star bursts .",
    "a similar idea has already been advocated by a number of authors , in particular by cowie et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and babul & rees ( 1992 ) .",
    "the difference is in the point that we have not introduced any population unobservable today and that we assume continuous star formation that is proportional to the gas abundance rather than the `` burst '' .",
    "the dwarf population , which is less luminous than ordinary irregular galaxies , plays no role in the results presented in this paper .",
    "there may be more irregular galaxies formed at higher @xmath19 , than are considered in this paper , but they should follow the same track as the disk component of spiral galaxies , and may constitute a low - luminosity tail of the lf of spiral galaxies , which is not important in galaxy number counts .",
    "the detailed shape of the subluminous part of the luminosity function is not important , unless the lf is very steep .",
    "there is much indication that correlation of galaxies seen in blue bands is weak ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1991 ; couch , jurcevic & boyle 1993 ; infante & pritchet 1995 ) , the clustering being at most comparable to that of late type galaxies .",
    "this is easy to understand : the @xmath4 sample at faint magnitudes is dominated by spiral galaxies and irregular galaxies which form from the peaks of low-@xmath163 fluctuations and are thus least biased .",
    "the local lf is clearly one of the most important sources of uncertainties , and it often hinders us from making unambiguous predictions from our model .",
    "the uncertainty in the local lf is not only in the faint end behaviour , but also in its normalization .",
    "an upward shift of the normalization by 0.15 dex would bring a number of predictions of the galaxy counts in much better agreement with observations , and also it would decrease substantially the amount of evolution required by the high redshift data .",
    "our normalization of the local lf , however , is on the high side of what is allowed by current surveys , so we can not justify a further increase by 0.15 dex .",
    "more important is the problem of the faint end ( @xmath180 mag ) of the lf .",
    "if the total lf has a flat slope ( @xmath181 ) as in , e.g. , loveday et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and lin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , that is compelling evidence for galaxy number evolution .",
    "luminosity evolution does not have enough power to explain the abundance of irregular galaxies required in our analysis .",
    "this view is consistent with the lf at various redshifts derived by ellis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : the luminosity evolution does not have power to lift the faint end of the lf . on the other hand , if the local luminosity function shows an increase towards the faint end ( metcalfe et al .",
    "1991 ; marzke et al . 1994 ; subbarao et al .",
    "1996 ) , we do not particularly need number evolution of galaxies , but luminosity evolution is sufficient to explain the observations .",
    "it is also possible that irregular galaxies have evolved into dwarf spheroidals near giant galaxies or in a galaxy rich environment . in this case",
    "the rise of the lf may take place @xmath1821 mag fainter than the typical luminosity of irregular galaxies .",
    "we have argued that @xmath6 band observations provide a good tool to study cosmology .",
    "this is because spheroids always contribute significantly to the @xmath6 band counts and the evolution of spheroids is reasonably well known .",
    "we have concluded that @xmath7 is disfavoured by the count data .",
    "this conclusion remains true , as long as we keep our basic assumptions .",
    "if , however , mergers play an important role at high @xmath19 , say @xmath183 , the @xmath7 model could be allowed .",
    "the @xmath19 distribution for @xmath7 cosmology has a component substantially extended to higher @xmath19 than in @xmath95 model .",
    "the median redshift of the spheroids in a @xmath184 sample is about 3 ( for an @xmath95 model ) , and an observation with @xmath24 and @xmath185 bands ( as in steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) searching for lyman break galaxies just hits the middle of the @xmath19-distribution at this magnitude .",
    "the possibility that not all spheroids are in place by @xmath186 may also modify the conclusion about cosmology , and it may bring a confusion as to the interpretation of the cosmological models .",

    "<S> the resulting scenario is that spiral galaxies formed as intergalactic gas accreting onto pre - existing bulges mostly at @xmath1 ; irregular galaxies as seen today formed by aggregation of clouds at @xmath2 . taking the formation epochs </S>",

    "<S> we represent the galaxies by e / s0 , sab , sc and irr ; low luminosity dwarfs or any objects unobservable today do not play a role in our considerations . in our model , spheroids follow passive evolution and the luminosity of spiral galaxies evolves only very slowly for a wide redshift interval due to a counterbalance between fading stars and new star formation from the gas replenished from intergalactic space . </S>",

    "<S> we argue that @xmath7 models are disfavoured , unless the basic assumptions of the present model are abandoned . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 band observations reach quite high redshift : for instance observations at @xmath6=23 mag may explore the formation epoch , which could be as high as @xmath8 . on the other hand , galaxies observed in the @xmath4 band are dominated by disks and irregulars , spheroids making a very small contribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that young irregular galaxies cause the steep slope of the counts . </S>",

    "<S> this interpretation is corroborated by a comparison of our prediction with the morphologically - classified galaxy counts in the @xmath5 band . </S>",
    "<S> we do not invoke sporadic star bursting : star formation takes place steadily as does today , but galaxies ( especially irregulars ) are gaseous at higher redshift , and hence star formation is much more active than today . </S>",
