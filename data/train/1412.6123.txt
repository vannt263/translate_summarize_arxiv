    "electrical manipulation of magnetization is a promising technique for enabling a new generation of magnetoelectronic devices .",
    "spin - transfer torque@xcite is an efficient way to implement the electrical control of magnetization , as has been demonstrated for various magnetic nanostructures such as spin valves , magnetic tunnel junctions , and magnetic nanowires . in the standard picture of spin - transfer torque ,",
    "an external electric field generates a spin - polarized electrical current , which in turn gives rise to _ current - induced _ spin - transfer torque . in magnetic nanowires with continuously varying magnetic textures ,",
    "this picture leads to two components of current - induced spin torque , which are known as adiabatic spin torque@xcite and non - adiabatic spin torque.@xcite the adiabatic spin torque arises from spin angular momentum conservation when conduction electron spins adiabatically follow the local magnetization direction .    the non - adiabatic spin torque , which is perpendicular to the adiabatic spin torque , arises from a variety of mechanisms and is a crucial factor for efficient electrical manipulation of magnetic textures such as magnetic domain walls and skyrmions . one mechanism for non - adiabatic spin torques occurs only for very short length scale variations in the magnetic texture,@xcite when the spins can not adiabatically follow the magnetization texture . in slowly varying magnetic textures , all previously considered mechanisms for non - adiabatic",
    "spin torques derive from either spin relaxation@xcite or spin - orbit coupling@xcite related to magnetic damping.@xcite here , we describe an intrinsic contribution to the non - adiabatic spin torque that arises in the slowly varying limit from an effective spin - orbit coupling due to the magnetic texture .",
    "it is distinguished from other contributions in that it is _ electric - field - induced _ rather than current - induced .",
    "the distinction we are trying to draw between electric - field - induced and current - induced torques is potentially confusing because current and electric field are proportional to each other . in linear response , either torque can be written as proportional to either the current or the field .",
    "the difference we would like to draw is in how the leading order constants of proportionality depend on the electron momentum - relaxation lifetime . by current - induced torque ,",
    "we mean one that is proportional to the current with a coefficient that is independent of the lifetime and is proportional to the electric field with a coefficient that is proportional to the lifetime ( or conductivity ) . by electric - field",
    "induced effect , we mean one that is proportional to the electric field with a coefficient that is independent of the lifetime and is proportional to the current with a coefficient that is inversely proportional to the lifetime .",
    "electric - field - induced spin - transfer torques differ from current - induced spin - transfer torques in that they do not originate from the electron occupation change giving rise to current flow .",
    "instead , they originate from the perturbation of the electronic states by an external electric field . in general",
    ", electric - field - induced effects depend on the modification of the electron states summed over the whole fermi sea , much as densities involve the sum over all occupied states , while current - induced effects depend on properties only at the fermi surface , much as electrical currents do",

    ", we examine electron transport through continuously varying magnetic textures and demonstrate the existence of an electric - field - induced spin torque .",
    "the result is _ intrinsic _ in the sense that it is independent of impurity scattering rates . for a free electron dispersion , we find that this electric - field - induced torque has the same form as the non - adiabatic spin torque but does not originate from extrinsic relaxation mechanisms , spin - orbit coupling , nor rapidly varying textures .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that it is significantly larger than other contributions to the non - adiabatic spin torque in some models , making it potentially important for optimizing the manipulation of magnetic structures such as magnetic domain walls and skyrmions .    the intrinsic non - adiabatic spin torque that we report here is closely related to the intrinsic spin - orbit torque@xcite calculated from a berry phase .",
    "previously , we reported@xcite that spin - orbit coupling generates chirality in magnetic properties and that many properties of a system acquire chiral counterparts upon the introduction of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we demonstrate below that the intrinsic spin - orbit torque is the chiral counterpart of the intrinsic non - adiabatic spin torque that we report here .",
    "this connection indicates the common origin of the two , which can be computed through a variety of techniques including a berry phase as done earlier@xcite or perturbation theory like we do here .",
    "this intrinsic spin - orbit torque is also electric - field - induced in the terminology we use in this paper .",
    "we present our result with a free electron model with exchange splitting for illustration , but the result can be easily generalized for arbitrary dispersions . as is the case for the spin hall effect in the closely related system with rashba spin - orbit coupling,@xcite the intrinsic non - adiabatic spin torque is exactly canceled by vertex corrections due to spin - independent scattering.@xcite however , we demonstrate that such exact cancellation only occurs for non - magnetic scatterers@xcite and this particular free - electron model .",

    "although a new basis is formed at each instantaneous time during magnetization dynamics , in general , the density matrix written in the new basis will have off - diagonal components in the spin . without an additional angular momentum source",
    ", these off - diagonal components can not relax and the spin can not change its value . in that case , the spin system can not reach steady state in the presence of an electric field because there is nowhere for the angular momentum to go except back to the magnetization .",
    "however , redfield@xcite demonstrated that a density matrix for the spin system relaxes to a diagonal matrix in the presence of a weak general coupling to a random bath ( like a phonon bath ) .",
    "this weak coupling allows for the transfer of angular momentum from the conduction electrons to the lattice via the phonons provided the relaxation process is fast compared to the magnetization dynamics . in transition",

    "( [ eq : llg ] ) and accounting for the angular momentum transfer .    a crucial point about this momentum transfer to the lattice caused by the coupling of the spin system to the phonons , is that the size of the torque is independent of the strength of this coupling , provided the coupling is not too weak . during the relaxation process , the random bath pushes angular momentum to the lattice from the spin - magnetization system .",
    "the existence of the lattice contribution to the angular momentum is crucial to provide a sink for angular momentum .",
    "however , the amount of the angular momentum absorbtion is determined by off - diagonal components of the density matrix , but not by details of the relaxation process such as the relaxation rate .",
    "therefore , this spin - transfer torque does not depend on the relaxation rate , but depends only on the existence of the relaxation process that brings the spin system to steady state on a time scale fast compared to the magnetization dynamics .",
    "such a situation , in which a weak coupling plays a crucial role but does not determine the size of the effect , is similar to the role of inelastic scattering when the resistance of a material is dominated by impurity scattering .",
    "the inelastic scattering is crucial for the existence of a steady state current flow but does not determine the resistance or even the net rate of heat generation . similarly here , the weak coupling to the bath is crucial for the flow of angular momentum to and from the bath but does not determine the rate of the flow .",
    "we emphasize that the assumptions made here hold very generally , particularly in spintronics .",
    "this assumption seems more crucial for our case , since we do not include any explicit spin - orbit coupling in the hamiltonian , making it straightforward to track the angular momentum flow . in other calculations ,",

    "is complicated by the fact that the mechanisms that contribute to @xmath35 also contribute to @xmath25.@xcite the ratio @xmath162 tends to remain close to one@xcite even when the system is modified to increase @xmath35 .",

    "a well known such relationship is onsager reciprocity .",

    "another relationship is the chiral connection@xcite we recently reported that gives a one - to - one correspondence for each term appearing in the equations of motion for a rashba spin - orbit coupling system and those in a a textured magnetic system .",
    "thus , the intrinsic non - adiabatic spin - transfer torque is connected to a contribution in a rashba system .",
    "the existence of the intrinsic non - adiabatic spin torque implies that there is an additional contribution to the spin motive force @xmath164@xcite since they are related by an onsager relation .",

    "we verify for a drifting spin spiral configuration given by eq .",
    "( [ eq(s):spiral profile ] ) that the inter - band transition contribution due to magnetization dynamics@xcite indeed generates such charge current .",

    "in addition , its chiral connection ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : chiral connection ] ) gives a large non - adiabatic spin - orbit motive force which can be larger than the extrinsic contribution.@xcite      we have shown earlier@xcite that there is a one - to - one correspondence between effects due to spatial variation of @xmath4 and those due to rashba spin - orbit coupling , @xmath183 , where @xmath87 is the rashba parameter and @xmath42 is the surface normal direction .",
    "rashba spin - orbit coupling effects can be obtained by simply replacing conventional derivatives @xmath184 by chiral derivatives @xmath185 in the equation of motion , where @xmath186 and @xmath187 is the unit vector along @xmath188 direction .",
    "this chiral derivative applied to the magnetization texture follows from the covariant derivatives@xcite that have been applied to electronic states and vector potentials in these same systems .",

    "the equivalence of these approaches can be verified by observing the relation between the kubo formula and the berry phase.@xcite in a similar way , when combined with the intrinsic non - adiabatic spin torque , a proper generalization of the chiral derivative provides an easy way to obtain a berry phase spin - orbit torque from other types of linear spin - orbit coupling such as dresselhaus spin - orbit couping@xcite and weyl spin - orbit coupling.@xcite we explicitly demonstrate in appendix  [ sec(a):chiral connection ] that rashba spin - orbit coupling and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling are two particular cases .",
    "in summary , electric - field - induced changes in electronic states make an intrinsic contribution to the non - adiabatic spin torque .",
    "this contribution arises from modifications to the states over the whole fermi sea and is independent of changes in the occupancy of the electron states .",
    "thus it should be regarded as an electric - field - induced contribution rather than one that is current - induced .",
    "this effect , which occurs in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , can be derived from a berry phase due to the motion of the electron spins through a spatially varying magnetization . through a chiral connection",
    ", it is closely related to the intrinsic spin - orbit torque that has been calculated from a berry phase in a uniformly magnetized system with rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "while the magnitude of the intrinsic contribution is sensitive to vertex corrections , we estimate that it is larger than other contributions to the non - adiabatic spin torque at least in some systems .",

    "<S> we derive an intrinsic contribution to the non - adiabatic spin torque for non - uniform magnetic textures . </S>",
    "<S> it differs from previously considered contributions in several ways and can be the dominant contribution in some models . </S>",
    "<S> it does not depend on the change in occupation of the electron states due to the current flow but rather is due to the perturbation of the electronic states when an electric field is applied . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it should be viewed as electric - field - induced rather than current - induced . unlike previously reported non - adiabatic spin torques </S>",
    "<S> , it does not originate from extrinsic relaxation mechanisms nor spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this intrinsic non - adiabatic spin torque is related by a chiral connection to the intrinsic spin - orbit torque that has been calculated from the berry phase for rashba systems . </S>"
