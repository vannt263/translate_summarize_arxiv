    "understanding factors that affect conductivity of graphene represents a fundamental task of great importance in view of possible application of graphene - based devices for electronics and optoelectronics .",
    "currently , the majority of experimental measurements of conductivity @xmath2 in graphene @xcite is analyzed on the basis the standard boltzmann approach within the born approximation predicting qualitative different results for short- and long - range impurity scattering@xcite    [ short - long ] @xmath3where @xmath4 is the electron density .",
    "it has been recently argued by stauber _",
    "et al_. @xcite that a standard way to examine the collision rate within the born approximation ( utilizing the unperturbed wave functions for a clean system ) is not suitable for the case of short - range interaction such as vacancies , resonant impurities , cracks etc .",
    "going beyond the born approximation , stauber _ _ et al.__@xcite and katsnelson and novoselov@xcite demonstrated that the short - range disorder , with the accuracy up to logarithmic corrections , leads to a linear density dependency similar to the one for the long - range potential ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the scatterer s radius , and @xmath7 is the impurity concentration .",

    "( [ stauber ] ) and arrived to the conclusion that strong neutral defects ( as opposed to the long - range coulomb impurities ) was the main scattering mechanism in graphene .",
    "the dominant role of neutral defects has been also recently outlined in refs ..    the reliability of the above predictions ( [ short - long ] ) , ( [ stauber ] ) can be established by testing them against exact  landauer - type quantum mechanical numerical calculations for the conductivity based on the tight - binding ( or dirac ) hamiltonian for carriers in graphene .",
