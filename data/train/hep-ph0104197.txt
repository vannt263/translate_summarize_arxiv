    "many authors have calculated meson loop corrections to the baryon masses , magnetic moments , weak currents @xcite , and other quantities in various versions of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the motivation is clear .",
    "loop effects involving the relatively light pseudoscalar mesons should give the leading long - distance or low - momentum corrections to the short - distance chiral expansion , and can modify the structure of the theory .",
    "the results are striking .",
    "individual loop corrections can be quite large , even so large in calculations using dimensional regularization that the convergence of the chiral expansion is questionable @xcite . however , the effects on fits to the baryon masses and moments are generally small .",
    "the corrections do not , for example , lead to large violations of the gell - mann  okubo relations for the masses @xcite or the okubo relation for the moments @xcite , both of which are satisfied by the short - distance expansions taken to o(@xmath0 ) in the symmetry - breaking strange - quark mass , and to leading order in a momentum expansion .",
    "the underlying reason for this result is that chiral perturbation theory is not a perturbation theory in the usual sense , with known expansion parameters .",
    "the short - distance parameters are not known _ a priori _ , but are rather determined in the fits to the data .",
    "all that is relevant in a final fit is the sum of the short - distance and loop contributions to each of the initial chiral invariants , and any new chiral invariants introduced by the loops @xcite .",
    "it is only the latter that lead to violations of the o(@xmath0 ) sum rules , and these new invariants are evidently small .",
    "this is not easy to see in the standard formulations given the complexity of the results",
    ". it is therefore be of interest to extract the new structures directly .    in the present paper ,",
    "we give a detailed structural analysis of the loop corrections to the baryon masses , and a less detailed analysis for the moments .",
    "our approach is based on the three - flavor - index representations of the effective octet and decuplet fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 and the corresponding reformulation of heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) developed in a preceding paper @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage of a close connection to quark - model ideas which can guide the decomposition of loop corrections in terms of effective one- , two- , and three - quark corrections .",
    "as we will show , the one - quark corrections can be absorbed completely in redefinitions of the chiral parameters , and substantial parts of the remaining corrections can be absorbed as well .",
    "the final results involve only effective operators which violate the o(@xmath0 ) sum rules and can be extracted directly .",
    "we also examine the momentum structure of the residual contributions to the masses .",
    "we find that , as usually calculated , they receive major contributions from momenta outside the the supposed range of validity of chpt .",
    "rather mild structural assumptions consistent with dynamical models for the baryons eliminate this problem .",
    "we believe that the methods developed here should be useful in other contexts as well , for example , in the analysis of axial currents and weak decays , and of low - energy meson - baryon scattering .",
    "they provide , in particular , a fairly transparent way of determining what quantities should be calculated in a given setting to get beyond the o(@xmath0 ) chiral expansion .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] , we review the properties of the effective baryon fields in the three - flavor - index notation we will use , write the lagrangian of hbchpt in this notation , and introduce a compressed operator description of the meson - baryon couplings and the one- and two - body contributions to the baryon mass operator .",
    "the last corresponds exactly to the o(@xmath0 ) mass operator in hbchpt , but is much simpler to analyze . in sec .",
    "[ sec : loops - masses ] , we analyze the structure of the one - loop corrections to the mass operator in detail , show that the bulk of the corrections can be absorbed in redefinitions of the parameters in the original mass operator , and isolate the new contributions that correct the gell - mann  okubo mass formulas . in sec .",
    "[ sec : moments ] , we give the structure of the baryon magnetic - moment operator to o(@xmath0 ) , analyze the loop corrections to the leading terms , and show that the corrections can be absorbed completely in redefinitions of the input parameters .",
    "the only new structure , with associated changes to the okubo relation for the moments , arises from loop corrections to terms in the moment operator that are already of o(@xmath0 ) .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",

    "it is appropriate for such processes to rewrite the chiral lagrangian by replacing the effective spin-1/2 octet and spin-3/2 decuplet baryon fields @xmath8 , @xmath9 by velocity - dependent fields @xmath10 , @xmath11 defined as @xcite @xmath12 this transformation eliminates the large momentum @xmath13 from the dirac equation , and projects out particle rather than antiparticle operators .",
