    "the foundation of the difference field approach was laid in  @xcite .",
    "karr s summation algorithm enables one to solve the parameterized telescoping problem within a given rational function field @xmath0 in which indefinite nested sums and products are represented by variables and the shift - behaviour of the objects is modelled by a field automorphism @xmath1 . as observed in  @xcite karr s algorithm covers also the creative telescoping paradigm of definite summation  @xcite .",
    "various improvements and extensions of such a difference field @xmath2 , also called a -field , have been incorporated into a strong summation theory within the last 15 years .",
    "these significant refinements enable one to find optimal product and sum representations by minimizing the nesting depth  @xcite , by minimizing the number of sums arising within the summand  @xcite , or minimizing the degree of the sums and products arising in the summands and multiplicands  @xcite .",
    "a central drawback of this field approach is the lack of treatment of the alternating sign @xmath3 which is one of the central building blocks in many summation problems .",
    "this object , and more generally @xmath4 with a primitive root of unity @xmath5 , can not be treated in a field or an integral domain : zero - divisors such as the factors of @xmath6 are introduced . in order to overcome this vulnerability ,",
    "a new difference ring theory has been elaborated  @xcite .",
    "the so - called -extensions have been introduced in which indefinite nested sums and products together with @xmath4 can be represented and in which the parameterized telescoping problem can be solved by efficient algorithms .",
    "the aim of this article is twofold .",
    "first , we will provide new insight in the theory of -extensions .",
    "in particular we will gain important characterizations and structural theorems for -extensions .",
    "second , we will emphasize the algorithmic nature of these results in order to push forward the difference ring approach to symbolic summation .",
    "+ here we will restrict our attention to the so - called basic -extensions  @xcite . more precisely , we start with a difference field @xmath2 ( e.g. , any of karr s -fields ) with the set of constants @xmath7 .",
    "then we extend this field to a difference ring @xmath8 by a tower of ring extensions of the following form ( see prop .  [",
    "prop : altdefofbasic ] below ) :    * algebraic ring extensions ( @xmath9-extensions ) which introduce objects of the type @xmath4 with @xmath10 being a root of unity ; * product extensions ( @xmath11-extensions ) which introduce nested products in terms of laurent polynomials where the multiplicands are invertible and the multiplicands are free of the defining generators of @xmath9-extensions ; * sum extensions ( @xmath12-extensions ) which introduce nested sums in terms of polynomials .    a tower of such extensions will be called a basic @xmath13-extension .",
    "finally , we impose that during the construction the constants remain unchanged , i.e. , @xmath14 . in this case , a basic @xmath13-extension will be called a basic -extension .",
    "we will supplement the difference ring theory of  @xcite with the following alternative characterizations of a basic -extension under the assumption that @xmath2 is constant - stable ( see definition  [ def : constantstable ] ) .",
    "more precisely , for a given tower of basic @xmath13-extensions @xmath8 over the ground field @xmath2 the following statements are equivalent :    1 .",
    "it forms a basic -extension , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath8 is simple , i.e. , any ideal of @xmath16 which is closed under @xmath17 is either @xmath16 or @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath8 can be composed by the interlacing of -extensions .",
    "@xmath8 can be embedded into the ring of sequences provided that @xmath2 can be embedded into the ring of sequences .",
    "we emphasize that similar statements have been derived in the setting of picard - vessiot rings in  @xcite ; see also  @xcite .",
    "however , much stronger assumptions are imposed in this setting , like assuming that the constant field @xmath19 is algebraically closed or that the algebraic closure of the ground field @xmath0 can be embedded into the ring of sequences .",
    "both avenues , the picard - vessiot approach  @xcite and the basic -approach , cover the class of dalembertian solutions  @xcite , the former from a very general and abstract viewpoint and the latter from a very algorithmic viewpoint . in other respects , they complement each other non - trivially : picard - vessiot rings can represent all the solutions of linear homogeneous recurrence relations , which is not possible by -extensions , and vice versa , basic -extensions can represent , e.g. , nested products , which can not be formulated in picard - vessiot rings .",
    "the worked out machinery for the embedding of basic -extensions into the ring of sequences is algorithmic .",
    "it has been implemented within the summation package ` sigma `  @xcite and provides a solution to the following problem : given an expression in terms of nested sums and products , find an alternative expressions such that the set of arising sums and products ( up to products with roots of unity ) is algebraically independent among each other .",
    "this toolbox produces very compact representations of nested sum expressions and plays a central role for large scale calculations in particle physics ; see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "moreover , following the ideas of  @xcite we will show that the parameterized telescoping problem enables one to show the algebraic independence of sums whose summands are expressible within an -extension .",
    "finally , exploiting the interlacing property of an -extension we will present a new reduction technique that solves the parameterized telescoping problem in an -extension or in its total ring of fractions .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows . in section  [ sec : aps ]",
    "we will introduce basic @xmath13-extensions and -extensions .",
    "in addition , we summarize the crucial ( algorithmic ) properties of -extensions introduced in  @xcite , and we present simple criteria to verify if an @xmath9-extension is an -extensions . the above equivalences between ( 1)(4 )",
    "are shown in sections  [ sec : simplerings][sec : embedding ] , respectively .",
    "finally , the applications mentioned in the previous paragraph will be worked out in sections  [ sec : telescoping ] and  [ sec : application ] .",
    "a conclusion is given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "moreover , we provided a constructive machinery to embed basic -extensions into the ring of sequences .",
    "as a consequence we can justify in full generality that the summation package ` sigma ` produces simplifications where the arising sums are algebraically independent . in this regard , we could generalize the difference field results of  @xcite to show that the non - existence of a parameterized telescoping solution ( in particular , of a creative telescoping solution ) in an -extension provides a proof that certain indefinite nested sums are algebraically independent .",
    "further investigations will be necessary in order to obtain similar results for simple -extensions  @xcite which enable one to represent also expressions in terms of nested products that depend on @xmath1827 for some @xmath1563 . besides this",
    ", it will be very interesting to see if the obtained results ( like , e.g. , theorem  [ thm : constructiso ] ) can contribute to new algorithmic aspects of the galois theory of difference equations  @xcite .",

    "<S> recently , -extensions have been introduced which extend karr s -fields substantially : one can represent expressions not only in terms of transcendental sums and products , but one can work also with products over primitive roots of unity . since one can solve the parameterized telescoping problem in such rings , covering as special cases the summation paradigms of telescoping and creative telescoping , one obtains a rather flexible toolbox for symbolic summation . </S>",
