    "recurrent novae are binary star systems in which mass is transferred onto a white dwarf ( wd ) primary from a main - sequence or a red giant secondary .",
    "the eruption is well - modeled as a thermonuclear runaway ( hydrogen shell flash ) , which occurs when a certain amount of mass ( @xmath4 ) is accumulated on the surface of the white dwarf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from their short recurrence periods ( from a ten to several tens of years ) and very rapid optical declines",
    ", it is believed that their white dwarfs are very massive and close to the chandrasekhar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the wd mass increases after every outburst , it will soon explode as a type ia supernova ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is , therefore , crucially important to know how close the wd mass is to the chandrasekhar mass and how much mass is left on the white dwarf after one cycle of nova outburst .",
    "the wd envelope rapidly expands and blows winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a result of hydrogen - flash , and its photospheric radius reaches a maximum and then gradually shrinks . since the total luminosity is almost constant during the outburst , the photospheric temperature increases in time .",
    "we easily understand this from stefan - boltzmann s equation , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the photospheric luminosity , radius , and temperature , respectively .",
    "the main emitting region moves from optical to ultraviolet , and then finally to supersoft x - ray , corresponding to from @xmath9k through @xmath10k .",
    "the photosphere drastically shrinks at the end of the wind phase and a supersoft x - ray phase starts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we are able to constrain the wd mass and its growth rate if turn - on / turnoff of a supersoft x - ray phase are detected , because they indicate the durations of wind mass loss ( how much mass is ejected ) and hydrogen shell burning without wind mass loss ( how much mass is left ) .",
    "the sixth recorded outburst of rs oph was discovered on 2006 february 12 by a japanese amateur astronomer h. narumi @xcite when it was shining at 4th magnitude .",
    "figure [ no_helium_heat ] shows the optical development of the outburst ( taken from * ? ? ?",
    "the visual light decayed rapidly during the first week and then the decay gradually slowed down ( `` early decline phase '' ) .",
    "it remained at about 10th magnitude from 40 to 80 days after the optical maximum , i.e. , for about 40 days ( `` mid - plateau phase '' ) .",
    "the final decline started about 80 days after the optical maximum ( `` final decline phase '' ) .",
    "it eventually decayed to 12th magnitude ( `` post - outburst minimum '' ) , which is a magnitude darker than that in usual quiescent phase .",
    "a very bright supersoft x - ray phase of rs oph was extensively observed by the _ swift _ xrt ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported the emergence of highly variable soft x - ray flux between 30 and 40 days after the optical maximum .",
    "then the supersoft x - ray flux was stabilized at about 40 days and reached a maximum at about 50 days , followed by a linear decline between 60 and 80 days from @xmath11 to @xmath12 counts  s@xmath2 for @xmath13 kev @xcite .",
    "it rapidly declined at about 90 days .",
    "thus the duration of supersoft x - ray phase is about 60 days @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we calculate theoretical light curve models based on the optically thick wind theory and reproduce both the supersoft x - ray and optical light curves . the main difference from our previous models",
    "@xcite is to include the effect of heat exchange between the hydrogen burning layer and the helium layer built up beneath the hydrogen burning zone .    in  [ x - ray_data_rs_oph ]",
    ", we present a complete light curve of supersoft x - ray for the 2006 outburst .",
    "the numerical model of our theoretical light curves and their fittings with the observation are presented in  [ model_xray_rs_oph ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in  [ discussion ] .",
    "we analyze _ swift _ xrt observations available in the heasarc database following the standard procedures .",
    "observations were taken in pc ( photon counting ) and wt ( windowed timing ) modes depending on the arrival count rate .",
    "source photons were extracted from a circular region of @xmath14 in pc mode and 40 @xmath1515 pixels in wt mode .",
    "no background subtraction was performed as it represented less than 1% of the emission during the analyzed phases of the outburst and therefore its effect was negligible . in figure",
    "[ no_helium_heat ] , we summarize an average value of the supersoft x - ray count rates in every 2000s bin . a narrow energy band of 0.3 - 0.55 kev was adopted in order to avoid possible contamination by a tail of hard x - ray photons coming from high temperature plasma at the shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported an oscillatory behavior in the _ swift _ xrt count rate during 30 and 31 days after the optical maximum , corresponding to the period in which the supersoft x - ray count rate first quickly rose ( fig .",
    "[ no_helium_heat ] ) . the count rate began to rapidly decline at about 80 days , which is coincident with the final decline of the optical light curve as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the optical mid - plateau phase of is first clearly identified by the @xmath16 light curve in the 2006 outburst @xcite .",
    "such mid - plateau phases are also observed in the other recurrent novae , and , which is interpreted as a disk irradiated by the central hot white dwarf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the irradiated disk is bright when the central white dwarf is as luminous as that for hydrogen shell - burning phase , and it becomes dark when the shell - burning ends .",
    "therefore the fact that the end of a supersoft x - ray phase is coincident with the end of a mid - plateau phase clearly indicates that this corresponds to the termination of hydrogen shell - burning on the white dwarf at about 80 days after the optical maximum .",
    "we calculate nova light curves based on the optically thick wind theory @xcite .",
    "our theoretical model is consisting of a white dwarf , a disk around the white dwarf , and a red giant companion .",
    "irradiation effects of each component are included @xcite .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we predicted the duration of a supersoft x - ray phase of the 2006 outburst .",
    "figure [ no_helium_heat ] shows our calculated supersoft x - ray fluxes by using the same method as in the previous paper , i.e. , we assumed an adiabatic condition at the bottom of the hydrogen burning layer @xcite , so heat did not flow inward but only outward .",
    "we can not reproduce the early emergence ( day @xmath17 ) and long duration ( 60 days ) of the supersoft x - ray phase at the same time .    here",
    "we introduce a new treatment by which we include the effect of heat exchange between the hydrogen burning zone and helium layer . after the optical maximum",
    ", convection descends in time .",
    "so no more processed helium is carried upward but it accumulates underneath the burning zone .",
    "the accumulated helium layer keeps a large amount of thermal energy because the temperature of burning zone is as high as @xmath18  k. the temperature of burning zone gradually decreases in the later phase of the outburst .",
    "then heat flux from the hot helium layer becomes important in the luminosity .",
    "this heat flux from the thermal reservoir makes the lifetime of a supersoft x - ray phase much longer .",
    "figure [ yes_helium_heat ] represents such new light curves for @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "it is very clear that both the earlier emergence and longer duration of a supersoft x - ray phase are realized at the same time .",
    "our numerical model should reproduce not only the supersoft x - ray light curve but also the visual light curve .",
    "figure [ rsoph2006_ssxs ] compares the observational visual light curve with our numerical ones . in the early decline phase , free - free emission from the optically thin ejecta dominates the visual light @xcite .",
    "the irradiation effects of the disk and the companion red giant dominate the optical light in the mid - plateau phase , whereas the wd photosphere does not contribute because it shrinks to @xmath22 , much smaller than the disk .",
    "the final decline started at about 80 days , corresponding to the decay of hydrogen - burning .    in the model with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , optically thick winds stopped at @xmath25 days after the optical peak .",
    "at this epoch , hydrogen of @xmath26 still exists and can supply more 14 days luminosity by nuclear burning . the heat stored in the helium layer , @xmath27 ergs ,",
    "can also supply a total luminosity of @xmath28 ergs s@xmath2 for another 20 days to the supersoft x - ray phase .",
    "therefore these energies can maintain the supersoft x - ray phase for a total of 34 days .",
    "as a result , steady hydrogen shell - burning on the white dwarf ends roughly at @xmath29 days .",
    "another critically important value , the mass accretion rate , can be estimated as follows : in our model with @xmath30 and @xmath24 ( @xmath31 ) , the envelope mass at the optical peak is @xmath32 .",
    "this implies that the average mass accretion rate onto the white dwarf is @xmath33 yr@xmath2 during the quiescent phase between 1985 and 2006 .",
    "here we neglect a dredge - up of core materials mainly because carbon and oxygen was not enriched in the ejecta . among the accreted matter",
    ", the wind carries away about 70% ( 50% ) , i.e. , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) ; this is much larger than the x - ray observational indication of @xmath36 by @xcite , but roughly consistent with the infrared observational indication of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "note that the wind duration is @xmath25 days ( 32 days ) .",
    "the residual , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , accumulates on the white dwarf .",
    "so the white dwarf is growing at an average rate of @xmath40 yr@xmath2 ( @xmath41 yr@xmath2 ) during @xmath42 .",
    "in the present work , we reproduce the duration of a supersoft x - ray phase by introducing heat flux from the helium layer underneath the hydrogen burning zone . in our previous works @xcite , we had included heat flux from the helium layer only during the cooling phase , for simplicity .",
    "when the wd mass is not so massive ( @xmath43 ) and the hydrogen content is not so small ( @xmath44 ) , this effect can be neglected because only a small part of nuclear energy is absorbed into the helium layer .",
    "however , we found that this effect can not be neglected when the wd mass is so massive as the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath45 ) and the hydrogen content is very small ( @xmath46 ) , as seen in figures [ no_helium_heat ] and [ yes_helium_heat ] .",
    "we have assumed that the chemical composition is uniform throughout the envelope for simplicity . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "a gradient of the hydrogen content is reasonable if convection descended in time during the rising phase of the nova outburst .",
    "although the hydrogen content of rs oph ejecta has not been estimated in detail , a very low hydrogen content @xmath47 was reported in the late phase of the u sco 1979 outburst @xcite .",
    "an interesting trend was also found in the latest 1999 outburst of : @xcite reported a rather high value of @xmath48 at 16 hours after the optical maximum and @xcite obtained a value of @xmath49 at @xmath50 days after the optical maximum .",
    "the hydrogen content , @xmath51 , may not be uniform but gradually increase outward .",
    "we assume @xmath52 but , in the plateau phase , we increase the hydrogen content from @xmath53 to @xmath54 at the hydrogen burning zone , where @xmath55 is the hydrogen content at the nuclear burning zone .",
    "as shown in figure [ rsoph2006_ssxs_mass ] , more hydrogen content extends the supersoft x - ray phase . in the previous work @xcite",
    ", we have estimated the wd mass to be @xmath56 from the optical light curve fitting .",
    "here we have estimated the wd mass and obtained the same results , that is , @xmath56 . a more massive white dwarf ( @xmath57 )",
    "can be rejected because the optical light curve decays too fast in the early decline phase and the duration of the supersoft x - ray phase is too short ( see fig .",
    "[ rsoph2006_ssxs_mass ] ) . a less massive one ( @xmath58 )",
    "can also be excluded because we must assume a very low hydrogen content to reproduce the early emergence of supersoft x - ray but its supersoft x - ray phase lasts too long and the visual decline is too slow as can be easily seen from figure [ rsoph2006_ssxs_mass ] .",
    "the supersoft x - ray flux from our model has been calculated from a blackbody photosphere .",
    "although the supersoft x - ray flux may not be a simple blackbody , our flux is a reasonable indication of the supersoft x - ray phase , because we intend to approximately explain the duration of the supersoft x - ray peak ( not the detailed behavior ) .",
    "a few groups resolved a size of near infrared emission for the rs oph 2006 outburst @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that a size of @xmath59 mas is consistent with the binary size if the distance is as short as 0.6 kpc @xcite but it is much larger than the binary size when the distance is as long as 1.6 kpc @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite revised their value and proposed a range of @xmath60 kpc .",
    "@xcite obtained that the angular diameter of infrared emission increased once to @xmath61 mas at about day 20 and then decreased to @xmath62 mas at about day 100 .",
    "our optically thick wind model suggests that the radius of near infrared ( @xmath63 ) photosphere is about 1 au , estimated from equation ( 11 ) of @xcite , near the optical maximum when free - free emission dominates infrared continuum .",
    "the radius quickly decreases because the wind mass - loss rate soon decreases and free - free emission becomes optically thin .",
    "this maximum radius of infrared free - free photosphere is smaller than the binary orbit ( @xmath64 au at the distance of 1.6 kpc ) , so that a size of @xmath65 mas infrared emission may originate from circumbinary matter as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus the supersoft x - ray light curve has led us to know various physical parameters of the white dwarf . in this work ,",
    "the optically thick wind is essentially important to understand the nova optical light curve and its supersoft x - ray duration because , without winds , the nova duration is too long to be compatible with the observation @xcite .",
    "moreover , the wind duration ( together with @xmath51 ) determines the amount of ejected mass and processed helium mass eventually left on the white dwarf .",
    "now we can conclude that the wd mass , @xmath66 , is now increasing .",
    "in fact the wd mass is currently increasing at @xmath67 yr@xmath2 .",
    "we may predict the future of the white dwarf .",
    "after it has come through many recurrent nova outbursts , the mass of the helium layer reaches a critical mass and a helium shell flash occurs .",
    "its strength is weak @xcite .",
    "therefore , only a small part of the helium layer will be blown off in the wind , and virtually all of the helium layer will be burnt into carbon - oxygen and accumulates in the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the wd mass can grow though many recurrent nova outbursts and helium shell flashes . if the companion will supply matter by the same rate as the present one for another hundred thousand years , we expect an type ia supernova explosion of the white dwarf .",
