    "gallium has attracted our interest due to its unusual physical properties .",
    "it is the only metal , except for mercury , cesium , and rubidium , which can be liquid near room temperatures ; this makes its use possible in high - temperature thermometers .",
    "it has one of the longest liquid ranges of any metal and has a low vapor pressure even at high temperatures .",
    "ga is stable in air and water and high - purity gallium is attacked only slowly by mineral acids . because of these properties ga can make interesting wire structures .",
    "consequently , ga adsorption or ga coating of swnt can be of particular interest from the electronic devices point of view .",
    "in this paper we present a systematic study on ga based nanowires .",
    "in the first part , binding geometry , cohesive energy , electronic properties and stability of various ga monatomic chain structures are analyzed . in the second part , single ga adsorption on various sites of the zigzag ( 8,0 )",
    "swnt is studied .",
    "our prime objective is to reveal the character and geometry of the bonding and to understand the effect of the adsorption on physical properties of swnt . in this context",
    "we also examined the formation of a ga monatomic chain on the ( 8,0 ) tube .",
    "finally in the third part , we considered the possibility of producing conducting wires through ga coating of swnt templates and hence investigated the properties of the ga covered ( 8,0 ) tubes .",
    "we found that ga monatomic chains are metallic and stable even at @xmath1k .",
    "single ga atom can be adsorbed to swnt both from outside and inside with a significant binding energy .",
    "we showed that ga atoms may form continuous and stable coverage of swnt that transforms the semiconducting tube into a high - conducting metal .",
    "our results suggest that ga is an element which can functionalize swnt to make interconnects or contacts for device applications .",

    "earlier studies showed that atoms of some elements can form stable monatomic chain structures.@xcite for example , it has been found that au and al can form three different chain structures;@xcite namely the linear chain ( lc ) , planar wide angle ( wz ) and narrow angle ( nz ) zigzag structures described by insets in fig .

    "analysis of the electronic band structure shows that all three chain structures studied here are metallic .",
    "the calculated energy band structures are illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] for each geometry .",
    "the lowest band of lc is due to the @xmath28-bond and is derived @xmath29 and @xmath30 valence orbitals of ga .",
    "the doubly degenerate @xmath31-band is formed from the bonding combination of @xmath32(@xmath33 ) orbitals which are perpendicular to the axis of lc .",
    "small displacement of every second ga atom perpendicular to the axis of the wz is a distortion that doubles the unit cell but lowers the binding energy .",
    "the bands of wz structure can be derived from those of lc in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] ; by going from lc to wz all bands of lc are folded and due to the breaking of cylindrical symmetry the doubly degenerate @xmath31- and @xmath34-bands are split .",
    "also the @xmath35-band of lc which dips into the fermi level near z , is lifted and becomes unoccupied in wz .",
    "the bands of nz structure are rather different from those of lc and wz structure , since each atom of nz has four nearest neighbors .",
    "the character of the bonds are illustrated by the charge density contour plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] . except delocalization due to @xmath35-band dipping into the fermi level , the charge density @xmath36 of lc structure depicts a double bond character .",
    "the double bond character is strengthen in the wz structure because of the lifting of the @xmath35-band from the fermi level .",
    "the total charge density of the nz structure becomes more uniform and metal - like in the plane of ga atoms .",
    "the electrical current through a metallic infinite nanowire with infinite mean free path @xmath37 is given by landauer type expression@xcite @xmath38 $ ] in terms of degeneracy @xmath39 , group velocity @xmath40 and density of states of each subband @xmath41 crossing the fermi level.@xcite then the ballistic conductance becomes @xmath42 ; namely the number of bands crossing the fermi level times @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "based on the band structures presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] , the ballistic conductances of infinite ga chain structures are found to be @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 for lc , nz and wz structures , respectively .",
    "owing to the small displacement of every second atom in wz structure one channel of lc is closed . in spite of two strands in",
    "nz its conductance is smaller than the conductance of two parallel lc .",
    "earlier it has been shown that the electronic properties of a swnt can be dramatically modified by the adsorption of foreign atoms.@xcite .",
    "for the adsorption on swnt , we considered four possible sites as an initial position of ga before structure optimization ; namely h - site above ( outside - exo ) or below ( inside - endo ) the surface hexagon , the z- and b - site above the zigzag , and axial c - c bonds , and the t - site above carbon atoms .",
    "the lowest energy binding site is determined by minimizing the total energy of swnt having a ga atom adsorbed at one of those sites described in fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] . to eliminate the ga - ga interaction , we considered a single ga atom adsorbed in every two unit cells of swnt .",
    "accordingly the lattice parameter of the supercell is approximately twice the lattice parameter of swnt , @xmath16 @xmath48 . to find",
    "the lowest binding energy for a given adsorption site all atomic positions ( swnt+ga ) and the supercell lattice parameter have been relaxed .",
    "the long range van der waals interaction , @xmath49 , is expected to be much smaller than the chemisorption binding energy and is omitted in the present calculations .",
    "the calculated @xmath5s for both swnt and graphene are listed in table [ tab : binding ] .",
    "the h - site is found to be energetically most favorable site among external sites . however , the binding of ga adsorbed at the h - site , but inside the tube yields @xmath50 ev , which is stronger than corresponding external adsorption .",
    "the binding of ga adsorbed inside is stronger , since the adsorbate interacts with more c atoms as compared with ga adsorbed outside . according to the mulliken analysis 2.1",
    "electrons are transferred from inside ga to swnt , while only 1.1 electrons are transferred to swnt when ga is adsorbed outside .",
    "these values are consistent with @xmath5s calculated for inside ( endo ) and outside ( exo ) adsorption . the binding energy is reduced to 1.1 ev for ga adsorbed on the graphene .",
    "this is an expected result and can be explained by the curvature effect which is the primary factor that strengthens the bonding on the swnt.@xcite    .",

    "upper panels are for exo adsorption of ga ; lower ones are for endo adsorption .",
    "zero of the energy is set at the fermi level and shown by dash - dotted lines . ]",
    "the electronic structure analysis indicates that ga adsorption both inside and outside ( in fact , forming a ga lc attached to swnt with @xmath51 ) metallizes the semiconducting swnt .",
    "the calculated energy band structures and ldos for both ga and swnt are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : hollow ] . according to ldos analysis",
    ", the band which crosses @xmath52 is derived mainly from swnt conduction band .",
    "this result combined with the mulliken analysis , yielding a charge transfer of 1.1 ( 2.1 ) electrons from exo ( endo ) adsorbed ga to swnt , suggests that ga electrons are donated to the lowest conduction bands of the bare ( 8,0 ) tube . as a result , initially empty conduction band of swnt is gradually populated and also modified upon adsorption of ga , which makes periodic ga+swnt system ( as treated within supercell geometry ) a metal .",
    "present results are consistent with the previous al+swnt studies.@xcite these results obtained from the supercell structure , where ga atom adsorbed on the swnt is repeated periodically , suggest that the doping of a swnt by an individual ga atom results in a donor state .",
    "the charge density contour plots calculated on a plane passing through exo ( endo ) adsorbed ga atom are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : chargecnt ] .",
    "the distribution of charge density between ga and swnt is consistent with the above arguments related with the bonding of ga atom .     of exo adsorbed ga and endo adsorbed ga on the h - site of the swnt surface .",
    "the chemical bonding and charge transfer from ga to swnt is revealed from counter plots .",
    "the axis of the swnt is shown by dashed lines . ]",
    "the discussion in the previous section shows that the semiconducting swnt is metallized as a result of ga adsorption , forming a chain with the lattice parameter @xmath53 within the supercell geometry .",
    "now we explore the effect of the chain formation of adsorbates , and investigate the ga zigzag chain on swnt .",
    "the initial structure is obtained by placing a ga atom at the adjacent h - site along the axis the tube .",
    "the structure of relaxed ga zigzag chain on swnt is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8x0chain ] . here",
    "the ga - ga nearest neighbor distance of 2.6@xmath54 is close to what is obtained in free wz structure .",
    "however , in the present case ga - swnt distance is increased from 2.4 @xmath54 ( the value corresponding to a single exo ga atom adsorption ) to @xmath55 .",
    "the strong ga - ga coupling in the adsorbed zigzag chain reduces the charge transfer from ga atom to the swnt . this way ,",
    "while ga - swnt bond is weakened , the ga - ga double bond is formed .",
    "this situation is consistent with the calculated binding energy and charge transfer .",
    "mulliken analysis yields 0.4 electrons transferred from each ga atom of the adsorbed wz chain to swnt .",
    "this value is 0.7 electrons smaller than that transferred in single ga adsorption . as for the binding energy between zigzag chain and swnt",
    "is calculated to be 0.4 ev .    the strong bonding between ga - ga , but weak bonding between ga - swnt is reflected to the calculated band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8x0chain ] .",
    "two bands around @xmath52 , one is almost fully occupied and the other almost empty are reminiscent of the @xmath31- bands of the free wz in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] .",
    "the weak ga - swnt interaction causes to distortion of these @xmath31-bands .",
    "calculated ldoss are in compliance with the present explanation .",
    "following the adsorption of ga atom @xmath56 and ga - zigzag chain @xmath57 we next study the ga coverage of swnt . to this end",
    "we attach one ga atom to each h - site on the swnt ; namely 16 ga atoms per unit cell . upon relaxation of the structure ga atoms move from their original position so that their distance from the surface of the swnt increases . owing to the relatively strong ga - ga interaction , ga - ga distance",
    "is reduced while ga - swnt distance is increased . at the end ,",
    "ga islands or stripes are formed above the swnt as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:16ga ] . in the same figure the distribution of ga - ga , ga - c and c -",
    "c interatomic distances are presented by histograms .",
    "we note that there are two different c - c bond distances in the swnt template .",
    "each of these islands or stripes form a metallic domain on the surface of swnt . in order to obtain a more uniform coverage",
    "we first add four more ga atoms between four islands seen in fig.[fig:16ga ] . upon relaxation",
    "ga atoms rearrange and start to form zigzag chain structures on the surface of swnt .",
    "finally , two more ga atoms are added to fill vacant sites of ga coating .",
    "further optimization of the structure has led to a continuous coverage with stable zigzag ga structures on swnt as illustrated in fig.[fig:22ga ] .",
    "the distribution of interatomic distances is also presented in the same figure . in the final structure",
    "ga nearest neighbor distances range between 2.5-@xmath58 and ga - c distance ranges between 2.4 - 4.0@xmath54 .",
    "the circular cross section of swnt becomes slightly elliptic .",
    "owing to the weak interaction between swnt and ga , the length of the c - c bond and the second nearest neighbor distances do not display significant changes and variations as compared to the bare swnt .",
    "however , the elliptic deformation of swnt gives rise to the dispersions in the third and forth nearest neighbor distances .",
    "non - uniformities of the ga coating are attributed to the lattice mismatch between swnt and ga 2d lattice .",
    "the charge transfer is about 0.4 electrons per ga atom and like the intermediate coverage , the system is metallic .",
    "it is expected that upon the formation of thick ga coating involving several ga layers around swnt the charge transfer further decreases and ga - c distance increases . under these circumstances",
    "a potential barrier can develop between the metallic ga coating and semiconducting swnt .",
    "such a situation can be exploited as metal - semiconductor junction device .",
    "the electronic structure having several bands crossing the fermi level indicates that ga coated swnt is high - conducting .",
    "the origin of the metallicity of ga covered swnt , which was a semiconductor in the absence of ga atoms , is determined by tdos and ldos indicating that the high state density originate from the ga atoms .",
    "the non - uniformity of the interatomic distances which may destroy the one - dimensional periodicity can give rise to the localization of current transporting states.@xcite this is characterized by the localization length @xmath59 .",
    "owing to the tubular nature and infinite cross section we expect that for ga - covered swnt @xmath60 with @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath62 is the diameter of the wire and @xmath63 is the fermi wavelength .",
    "our estimation suggests that @xmath59 is in fact much larger than typical length scale of interconnects .",
    "the stability of ga coating is important to produce a stable conducting nanowire .",
    "the _ ab initio _ md calculation of fully ga covered swnt at 1200k has shown that the system were stable after 50 time steps .",
    "continuity were maintained ; neither clusterings nor vacancies have occurred .",
    "furthermore , we tested the stability of ga coating ( tubular structure ) by deleting swnt and by relaxing it at t=0 .",
    "after full relaxation tubular form has remained .",
    "it appears that ga tube made of zigzag chains contributes to the stability of ga covered swnt .",
    "the wetting of liquid metals on solid metals and non - metallic materials had been studied extensively to form composites with exceptional properties.@xcite we believe that present results are relevant to the wettability of graphite and swnt by liquid ga to produce ga - matrix composites or to form ga intermediates to attach other metals .",
    "the present study has revealed interesting features of ga element in forming chain structure , and also in coating of a semiconducting swnt .",
    "ga forms monatomic linear and zigzag chain structures which are metallic and stable even at high temperatures .",
    "the zigzag structures are energetically more favorable than the linear structure .",
    "the electronic properties of swnt can be modified via single ga adsorption .",
    "individual ga adsorbed inside or outside the tube gives rise to donor states .",
    "this , in turn , makes the initially semiconducting swnt metallic at finite temperature due to charge transfer from ga atoms to nanotube .",
    "swnt can serve as a template for constructing stable ga chains on its surface .",
    "the @xmath64 electrons from ga chain partially transferred to swnt and generate additional states around @xmath52 .",
    "the band structure analysis shows that initially semiconducting swnt transforms into a metal with adsorption of ga atoms .",
    "finally , it is shown that the formation of continuous ga coverage of swnt can be achieved .",
    "this possibility revealed by a theoretical study requires , of - course , the elaboration of growth conditions which determines the quality of growth . the circular cross - section changes into elliptical form after the full coverage of ga .",
    "the swnt becomes a quasi-1d metal with high state density at @xmath52 .",
    "as @xmath65 orbitals of ga behave like semi - core states , the ground state of ga covered swnt system is non - magnetic .",
    "the _ ab initio _ md calculations at @xmath66k have shown that ga coating is stable even at high temperatures .",
    "these results suggest that a swnt can be used as template to produce high - conducting nanowires by using ga coverage .",
    "ga atoms being liquid at room temperature and stable in air and water can be used to produce 1d conductors , thin metallic connects and nanometersized electronic devices which may find technological applications in nanoscience . in particular , the conductivity of liquid ga - filled swnt can be exploited as nanoswitch .",
