    "in his 1949 seminal paper @xcite , p.a.m . dirac proposed three peculiar representations of the poincar group , in strict relation with the choice of possible space - time hypersurfaces without a time - like direction , ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) : the instant form , the light - front ( lf ) form and the point form ( cf @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "each hypersurface leads to a specific , but equivalent , description of the dynamics of a relativistic interacting system . as a matter of fact",
    ", the choice of an initial hypersurface , in which the points are separated by space - like distances and therefore no causal connections are allowed , suggests the set of dynamically independent variables , suited for implementing a description of the initial state of an interacting system . in conclusion ,",
    "dirac indicated the potentially fruitful role of the hamiltonian approach for relativistically describing interacting systems , within a field theoretical framework , as well ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the instant form , corresponding to the choice of a constant - time hypersurface in the minkowski space ( @xmath0 ) , translations and rotations , being the generators in the stability set of the chosen hypersurface , commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , constructed in terms of the fock - space basis ( in this basis the free hamiltonian is diagonal ) , have both the eigenvalues of the total three - momentum and the total angular moment as good quantum numbers . translations and rotations do not mix different fock - components of the wave function and therefore a truncation in the fock - space , that is required for practical applications , is stable under those transformations .",
    "differently , the instant - form boosts have dynamical nature and therefore they mix the fock components . the shortcoming of a truncated instant - form fock basis is made manifest by the lack of lorentz invariance , e.g. when we evaluate the expectation value of observables involving initial and final rest - frames , having a relative non zero velocity .    in the lf form ,",
    "where the hypersurface @xmath1 is chosen for quantizing the theory , one has a kinematical subgroup of the poincar group , built by seven generators ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such operators , keeping invariant the lf hypersurface , do not contain the interaction and they correspond to i ) three lf translations , ii ) a longitudinal lf boost along the z - direction , iii ) a rotation around z , and iv ) two transverse lf boosts , suitable linear combinations of transverse instant - form boosts and rotations .",
    "the remaining three generators have a dynamical nature : i ) two lf transverse rotations , like the lf boosts but with different sign combinations , and ii ) the hamiltonian @xmath2 , i.e. , the generator of lf - time @xmath3 translations . from this classification ,",
    "immediately an important feature stems out : the stability under lf boosts of any truncated fock expansion of the physical states ( eigenstates of the squared mass fock - space operator , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , since the lf boosts are diagonal in the fock space @xcite .",
    "this property is fundamental for a consistent treatment of the boosts when a truncated fock basis is adopted .",
    "for example , if one calculates electromagnetic form factors for momentum transfers along the @xmath4direction ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite ) , the initial and final rest - frames are related simply by a kinematical transformation , and therefore one could use a truncated description of the initial and final states . as a last remark , it is worth noting that the change to lf variables allows one to linearize the dependence upon the dynamical variable ( conjugated to the lf time ) , with a simplification in the analysis of the poles in the propagators ( i.e. , @xmath7 + i\\epsilon$ ] ) .",
    "the physical outcome of a quantum theory does not depend on the particular space - time hypersurface adopted for quantizing , and therefore the theory has to have an equivalent four - dimensional ( 4d ) formulation , where explicit covariance is built in . in this respect , the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse )",
    "is a 4d field - theoretical tool @xcite to explore the non perturbative physics of bound and scattering states of few - particle systems . within a lf framework",
    ", it can be easily shown that the projection onto the lf hyperplane of the bs amplitude is proportional to the _ valence component _ of the physical state ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests to take the bse as the starting point for an investigation of the internal dynamics , alternative to the one where a coupled - equation system , generated by the hamiltonian acting on the full fock space , is considered . in order to pave the way from the bse to the eigenequation for the 3d valence component and back ,",
    "another important suggestion is offered by the idea of  iterated resolvents  of refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is proposed that the complexity of the fock - space lf hamiltonian builds an effective dynamics for the 3d valence state .",
    "indeed , it should be pointed out that the mass operator for the 3d valence component can be exactly obtained from the bse by a quasi - potential ( qp ) expansion @xcite , as investigated in refs . @xcite and @xcite ( where the associated set of coupled equations for lf green s functions was derived ) .",
    "the qp approach makes feasible to single out the  trivial  global propagation of the interacting system by means of a well - defined auxiliary green s function ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 2.11a ] ) and ( [ g0tilde ] ) , below ) .",
    "this fundamental goal , in turn , allows one to reconstruct the bs amplitude from the 3d valence component , with a one - to - one correspondence , and moreover , to obtain the expansion of the 3d effective interaction , entering the eigenequation for the valence component . each contribution to",
    "the expansion immediately acquaints a transparent physical interpretation ( given the strong analogy between the lf evolution and the non relativistic one ) that produces a straightforward guidance in evaluating the relative importance of the associated diagrams",
    ". the same analysis seems more involved in the studies of the hamiltonian in a truncated fock - space , i.e. in the analysis of the generated system of coupled equations .",
    "noteworthy , the convergence of the expansion , that has a direct impact on the lost of covariance with respect to the subset of the dynamical transformations , has been investigated in a simple bosonic yukawa model in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the fock content of each contribution has been recognized as the ordering  parameter  .",
    "in closing , the qp technique appears so appealing within the lf framework , that it could be very interesting to implement comparisons between actual calculations performed in other relativistic qp approaches , like the covariant spectator theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) applied in many relevant few - nucleon problems",
    ".    the lf projection of the bse for few - particle systems , and the consequent truncation of the physical state in the fock space , can be useful if there is a dominant valence state , or if the normalization can be saturated at large extent by including only few fock components . in nuclear physics ,",
    "the nucleonic component is largely dominant , as in the deuteron case , while in applications to hadrons , fock components beyond the valence one have been recognized to be relevant , in particular in the description of physical quantities pertaining to inelastic channels , like structure functions and generalized parton distributions ( from deeply virtual compton scattering @xcite ) . recently",
    ", a signature of the the relevance of the components beyond the valence one has been singled out in the evaluation of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors by using constituent quark degrees of freedom in the @xmath6 frame @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a zero in the proton electric form factor has been associated with a cancellation between valence and nonvalence contributions to the electromagnetic current ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for the experimental overview ) .",
    "aim of the present review is to yield some insights on i ) the technique for projecting the 4d bse onto the three - dimensional ( 3d ) lf hypersurface using the quasi - potential approach and ii ) the construction of the effective dynamics of the valence component of the lf wave function for both two- @xcite and three - particle systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , some details on how to obtain an effective electromagnetic current operator i ) acting on the valence component of composite two - boson and two - fermion systems , and ii ) fulfilling the ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) @xcite and @xcite , are given .",
    "the review is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "3 , the relation one - to - one between the bs amplitude and the lf valence wave - function is illustrated . in sec .",

    "5 the projection technique for three - body bs equations is briefly discussed , along with the role of induced three - body forces . in sect .",
    "6 , the electromagnetic current operator , acting on the valence component and fulfilling the lf ward - takahashi identity is introduced , with some remarks on both structure and covariance of the truncated ( in the fock space ) current . in sec .",
    "7 , a summary and some perspectives are presented .",
    "the 4d bse ( see , e.g. @xcite ) is the starting point of many studies of few - body systems which aim to account for relativity .",
    "the bse requires a relativistic field - theoretical approach , based on an interacting lagrangian able to model the system under investigation . in the particular case of a two - body scattering , the 4d scattering equation for the transition matrix , @xmath8 , with total four - momentum @xmath9",
    "is written as follows @xmath10 where the interaction @xmath11 contains , in principle , all the possible two - body irreducible diagrams .",
    "the two - body disconnected green s function , @xmath12 , should include self - energy terms , but they are neglected in the approach developed so far .",
    "therefore , in the case of two bosons , @xmath12 becomes @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the four - momentum operator and the factor @xmath15 is introduced for convenience . for two fermions",
    "one has @xmath16    the two - particle bound - state with total 4-momentum @xmath17 , @xmath18 , corresponds to a t - matrix pole .",
    "the residue is associated with the vertex function , namely the nontrivial of part the bs amplitude , @xmath19 , solution of the following homogeneous equation @xmath20 the normalization condition  @xcite has to be satisfied in order to fully determine @xmath21 . for scattering states with total 4-momentum @xmath9 ,",
    "the bs amplitude is a solution of the following inhomogeneous equation @xmath22 while the t - matrix , solution of eq.([1 ] ) , corresponds to the connected four - point function which brings information on both the scattering and bound states . in eqs .",
    "( [ 1.2ab ] ) and ( [ 1.2as ] ) the four - momentum conserving @xmath23-function is factorized out .",
    "since in the lf projection method a central role is played by the on - minus - shell propagation , as it will be emphasized below , let us write the relevant matrix elements of the free two - boson green s function , viz k_1 ^ -| g_0(k)|k^-_1= =  , [ 3 ] where the lf four - momenta are @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the on - minus - shell momentum operator , with eigenfunctions given by the lf plane waves , @xmath27 . the completeness relation and the normalization are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the free two - fermion propagator , @xmath30 , can be decomposed in an on - minus - shell term , @xmath31 , and a part that contains the so - called instantaneous ( in the lf - time ) contribution , since the dirac propagator can be separated in two terms as follows @xmath32 where the first term yields the on - minus - shell propagation , while the second one the lf - time instantaneous term of the dirac propagator . for the fermion case",

    "@xmath34 .",
    "one could easily extend the present analysis to systems composed by particle - antiparticle or by other mixtures , like a fermion and a boson ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the first step for projecting the bse onto the lf surface is the introduction of the free - resolvent , i.e. , the fourier transform in @xmath35 of the global @xmath3-time free propagator of the two - particle system .",
    "this amounts to integrate the matrix elements , eq .",

    "( [ 2.11a ] ) , the vertical bars  @xmath47  on the right side and on the left one indicate that the minus components in @xmath48 and @xmath49 have to be integrated out @xcite , respectively .",
    "notice that , for two fermions , the inverse of @xmath40 exists only in the valence sector , since the projectors , @xmath50 , single out only positive energy states .    within the qp approach @xcite , where an auxiliary interaction , @xmath51 , is introduced",
    ", the full t - matrix is solution of the following coupled equations @xmath52 where @xmath53 for bosons and @xmath54 for fermions .",
    "the auxiliary green s function @xmath55 is a 4d operator , depending upon the four - momenta of the two constituents , and it represents the key quantity of the lf projection .",
    "it is the 4d image of the 3d dimensional @xmath40 , that , we strongly stress , does not contain the relative - time propagation of the system . therefore @xmath56 just takes into account such a propagation in the 4d space , namely it will be an essential ingredient in the description of the internal dynamics of the systems . the 4d operator @xmath57 is defined by g_0(k)=|_0(k ) g_0(k ) _ 0(k )  , [ g0tilde ] where |_0(k)= g_0(k ) |",

    "these operators , _ the free reverse lf - projection operators _ , connect three and four dimensional quantities . in the next section the corresponding interacting operators will be introduced .",
    "it is worth noting that the choice of @xmath57 and the corresponding integral equation for @xmath51 , eq .",

    "( [ expw ] ) puts a bound on the number of the fock components involved in the actual calculation .",
    "moreover , the same holds for the 3d effective interaction @xmath59 that determines the valence component , as shown in the following section .",
    "in particular , the 3d effective interaction , since it is non diagonal in the fock space , makes possible the coupling of the valence sector to the higher fock components of the wave function ( formal details are given in sec . 4 and @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , in model studies ( see @xcite ) , the expansion ( [ expw ] ) is rapidly converging , since the probability of higher fock states is quickly decreasing @xcite .    in fermionic models , with point - like couplings ,",
    "the lf bse was investigated by retaining the lowest order kernel and subtle problems , related to the divergences produced by the dependence upon the transverse momentum , were found @xcite .",

    "although the explicit expression of the truncated lf current is rather involved , the physical picture that arises is quite sensible : the truncated lf two - body current , that fulfills the proper wti , is generated by attaching the photon in all the possible ways to the truncated effective interaction operators , that are present in the truncated reverse lf projectors ( see eq .",

    ", the choice of a frame different from the celebrated drell - yan one , namely a frame where the plus component of the momentum transfer is not vanishing , allows one to study the fock content of the system state , by coupling small components to large components ( for an analysis of the physical impact on actual cases in hadronic physics see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in this review , we have given a short presentation of the lf projection method , based on a combination of the integration on the minus component of the constituent four - momenta and the quasi - potential formalism @xcite .",
    "this approach allows one to formally establish a one - to - one relation between the bethe - salpeter amplitude and the 3d lf valence component of a bosonic or fermionic system , and it makes natural to address the issue of the fock content of the dynamics governing the system under investigation .",
    "in particular , in sect . [ hiera ] , it has been shown that by using the quasi - potential approach , in the spirit of the  iterated resolvents  suggested by h.c .",
    "pauli @xcite , one can construct a set of coupled equations for the lf resolvents , that allows one to arrange a sort of tomography in the fock space of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "finally , the extension of the lf projection method to the three - particle case has been outlined .    from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", the last section contained the most relevant topic .",
    "there , we briefly presented the derivation of the conserved 3d lf electromagnetic current operator and the associated ward - takahashi identity .",
    "the issue of the truncation in the fock space of the lf current , and the consequent elaboration for obtaining a truncated ward - takahashi identity has been discussed . in particular , it has been pointed out that in order to fulfill the current conservation , the valence wave functions have to be solutions of the suitable eigenequation , obtained from the truncated green s function .    in conclusion , we would mention that , within the framework of the lf projection method , the calculation of the deuteron electromagnetic form factors , with two - body currents obtained from a pion exchange interaction , and the investigation of the relation between the analytic properties of the nakanishi representation and the fock decomposition of the bs amplitude ( see e.g. @xcite ) are in progress .",
