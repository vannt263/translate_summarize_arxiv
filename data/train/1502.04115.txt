    "the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite has completed basics of the standard model ( sm ) . however , this is not the end of the story .",
    "first of all , sm could not answer many fundamental questions;for instance , left - handed structure of charged weak currents is put by hand , mass and mixing pattern of the sm fermions are not clarified etc . for these reasons a number of beyond the sm ( bsm ) models are developed . fortunately , future running of the lhc with upgraded parameters will shed light on answers for some of these questions . secondly",
    ", higgs field provides only @xmath4 of the mass of the visible universe . in order to understand the origin of remaining @xmath5 we should clarify basics of the qcd , especially small-@xmath6 ( bjorken ) region",
    "this is why the qcd explorer option of the lhc - based @xmath1 colliders is mandatory @xcite .",
    "tev scale colliders can be classified using colliding particles or collider types .",
    "while the first classification includes hadron - hadron , lepton - hadron and lepton - lepton collisions the other includes collider types with ring - ring , linac - ring and linac - linac options . concerning the energy frontiers linac - ring type colliders",
    "provide the sole realistic way to handle ( multi ) tev scale in lepton - hadron collisions at constituent level @xcite ( see , also , review @xcite ) .",
    "certainly , hadron colliders ( lhc and fcc ) should be considered as the main discovery tools for new particles . in this respect ,",
    "priority of lepton - lepton or lepton - hadron colliders will be determined by the lhc or fcc results .",
    "if the observed bsm physics will be connected to the first family fermions , @xmath1 colliders will have priority due to larger center - of - mass energy comparing to electron - positron colliders .",
    "left - handed structure of charged weak currents has most elegant explanation in @xmath7 models @xcite , where the mass of @xmath3 boson is much higher than the mass of @xmath8 boson .",
    "in addition , these models predict existence of the second heavy @xmath9 boson , as well as , three heavy majorana neutrinos ( @xmath0 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and a number of additional higgs bosons , including double - charged ones . therefore , there are a lot of interesting phenomena , that can be investigated at tev energy colliders . for example ,",
    "production of @xmath3 at hadron colliders , followed by @xmath12 decays , leads to a very clear signature , namely two same - sign leptons in association with two jets @xcite .",
    "recently , the process @xmath13 followed by @xmath14 decay has been investigated by cms collaboration @xcite , where @xmath15 excess at @xmath16 tev is observed .",
    "however , only one of the @xmath17 reconstructed events contains same - sign electrons , while it is expected half of the events to be same - sign in the case of majorana @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze production of @xmath0 at future @xmath1 colliders via the back - groundless process @xmath2 . in section 2 tentative parameters of possible lhc and fcc based @xmath1 colliders are presented . a brief description of the @xmath7 model is given in section 3 . in section 4 , we show production cross - sections depending on @xmath0 mass for several values of @xmath3 mass and different center - of - mass energies , as well as @xmath18 and @xmath19 plots in @xmath0-@xmath3 mass plane",
    ". rough comparison of @xmath20 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 colliders potentials for @xmath0 investigation is performed in section 5 .",
    "finally , in section 6 we give some conclusions and recommendations .",
    "electron - proton scattering experiments have played a very important role in the development of our knowledge of the structure of matter .",
    "for example , quark - parton structure was discovered in deep - inelastic scattering . as mentioned above , qcd explorer option ( @xmath22 gev ) of the lhc - based @xmath1 colliders ( lhec ) is mandatory for clarifying dynamics of strong interactions at extremely small-@xmath6 and , at the same time , sufficiently high @xmath23 region .",
    "in addition , eic ( e - rhic ) will give opportunity to investigate another critical region , namely , @xmath24 .",
    "concerning bsm , new physics higher electron and/or proton beam energies are needed . in table 1 we present tentative parameters for possible lhc and fcc based @xmath1 collider options .",
    "opl , erl and operl denotes one pulse linac , energy recovery linac and one pulse energy recovery linac , respectively .",
    "erl60 is continuous wave superconducting recirculating energy - recovery linac , which has been chosen as the main line for lhec ( see section 7.1.2 in lhec cdr @xcite ) . opl60 and",
    "opl140 options for lhec are considered in section 7.1.4 of the lhec cdr , and operl150 option is considered in section 7.1.5 , where this option is named as higher - energy lhec erl option .",
    "luminosity for opl500 and operl500 options for lhec are estimated by assuming that electron beam powers are the same as in the opl140 and operl150 cases , respectively ( in this case @xmath25 is inverse proportional to @xmath26 ) .",
    "parameters for the first three options of fcc - based @xmath1 colliders are taken from @xcite .",
    "luminosity values for the last two options are taken same as opl140 and operl150 lhec options for following reason : the loss due to higher electron energy @xmath26 is compensated by smaller proton beam size due to higher @xmath27 .",

    "the most stringent limit on @xmath3 mass from low energy data , namely , @xmath37 tev , comes from @xmath38 mixing @xcite .",
    "search for @xmath39 performed by atlas and cms using @xmath40 tev data lead to the same limit for @xmath41 around @xmath42 tev @xcite .",
    "recent cms analysis of this channel increases the limit up to @xmath43 tev @xcite .",

    "similar distributions for @xmath48 and @xmath49 tev are presented in figs.@xmath50 , @xmath43 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "keeping in mind , integral luminosity values given in the last column of the table @xmath42 , one can see that erl60 , opl60 and opl140 options of the lhc based @xmath1 colliders could not provide essential contributions to the @xmath0 investigation .",

    "rough estimations @xcite show that @xmath1 colliders are advantageous comparing to lepton colliders for a lot phenomena .",
    "moreover , analysis of excited electron production performed in the article by o.cakir et al.@xcite show that lc@xmath66lhc is more promising than the lhc and much more promising than the lc for the processes considered . in this analysis following collider parameters",
