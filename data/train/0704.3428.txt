    "in the last few years , an increase in the interest in the study of dynamical systems and design of nonlinear circuits generating chaotic beats has been observed [ grygiel & szlachetka , 2002 ; cafagna & grassi , 2004 - 2006 ; liwa _ et .",
    "al . _ , 2007 ] .",
    "beats in a nonlinear oscillator appear if the oscillator becomes quasi - periodic for any reason , for example , due to the frequency detuning [ minorski , 1962 ] . usually , in nonlinear systems , we observe repeated sequences of complicated revivals and collapses [ eberly _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1980 ; abdalla _ et .",
    "chaotic revivals and collapses , in contradistinction to the quasi - periodic ones , do not have any repeated structure .",
    "the degree of chaoticity of beats generated in a dynamical system is usually confirmed with the lyapunov exponents .",
    "this approach seems to be necessary as intricate quasi - periodic beats frequently resemble chaotic beats and _",
    "vice versa_. in particular , the numerical procedure proposed by wolf [ wolf _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1985 ] is a useful and efficient method to get such exponents ( ordered from maximal to minimal value ) , known also as the spectrum of lyapunov exponents .",
    "the first exponent is traditionally named the maximal lyapunov exponent ( mle ) , and its positive value is indicated of a chaotic motion .",
    "two positive lyapunov exponents denote hyperchaotic behaviour .",
    "one way to get chaotic beats from their quasi - periodic counterpart is to decrease damping in the quasi - periodic system .",
    "this action , usually , leads to generation of weakly chaotic beats [ liwa _ et .",
    "al . _ , 2007 ] .",
    "therefore , the problem is to find a way of generation of strongly chaotic beats . in this letter",
    ", we propose a solution to this problem , by way of example , in a simple nonlinear optical process  second - harmonic generation of light , using the concept of a typical optical coupler [ peina , jr .",
    "& peina , 2000 ] that is made of two identical systems interacting linearly with each other .",
    "let us first consider the generation of chaotic beats in a single system .",
    "we study the following dynamical system [ drummond _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1980 ; mandel & erneux , 1982 ; gao , 2004 ] : @xmath0 where the complex variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the amplitudes of the fundamental and second - harmonics modes , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 governs the nonlinear interactions between both modes .",
    "the quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the frequencies of the fundamental and second - harmonic modes , respectively . the terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 describe the mechanism of loss .",
    "moreover , the system is pumped by an external field @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an electric field amplitude at the frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the parameters , @xmath4 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath3 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are taken to be real .",
    "if @xmath13 , the loss mechanism in the second harmonic mode is usually neglected , that is we assume @xmath14 .",
    "this simplification is frequently called a good frequency conversion limit . the system ( [ e1])([e2 ] ) has three periodic solutions .",
    "namely , two coexisting solutions , when @xmath14 and @xmath15 [ liwa _ et .",
    "al . _ , 2007 ] : @xmath16 and the resonance solution ,",
    "when @xmath17 [ mandel & erneux , 1982 ] : @xmath18 { \\frac{\\gamma_{b}f}{\\epsilon^{2}}+ \\sqrt{\\left ( \\frac{2\\gamma_{a}\\gamma_{b}}{3\\epsilon^{2}}\\right)^{3 }   + \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{b}f}{\\epsilon^{2}}\\right)^{2}}}\\,,\\\\ \\nonumber \\label{e8 } b&=&\\sqrt[3 ] { \\frac{\\gamma_{b}f}{\\epsilon^{2}}- \\sqrt{\\left ( \\frac{2\\gamma_{a}\\gamma_{b}}{3\\epsilon^{2}}\\right)^{3 } + \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{b}f}{\\epsilon^{2}}\\right)^{2}}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we may expect that revivals and collapses ( beats ) appear in the neighbourhood of the periodic solutions if the conditions of periodicity are not held . for solutions ( [ e3])([e4 ] ) the region of beat frequencies",
    "is situated between the frequencies @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see fig.2 in [ liwa _ et .",
    "al . _ , 2007 ] ) .",
    "beats in this region are either quasi - periodic or chaotic depending on the value of the damping constant @xmath11 .",
    "beats can also be generated in the neighbourhood of solutions ( [ e5])([e6 ] ) if @xmath21 .",
    "however , the generation of beats when the second harmonic mode is damped ( @xmath22 ) , is much less efficient than in the good frequency conversion limit , where @xmath14 .",
    "let us shortly consider this problem by way of a numerical example .",
    "the results are presented in fig.1 .",
    "the lyapunov map shows the regions of quasi - periodic beats , chaotic beats and purely periodic behaviour ; individual colours correspond to the values of the maximal lyapunov exponents .",
    "the case of beats generation corresponds the inside of the parabola , while the periodic states correspond to the region outside it . as seen , the regions corresponding to chaotic beats ( positive value of mle ) are in the lower part of the parabola ( blue and yellow areas ) .",
    "mle s are of the rank @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , beats generated in the neighbourhood of the resonance @xmath24 are weakly chaotic .",
    "an attempt at enhancing the chaoticity of the beats by increasing the amplitude @xmath9 has proved ineffective . assuming e.g. @xmath25 instead of @xmath26 the chaoticity increases but the structure of the beats is destroyed .",
    "therefore , the problem arises how to force the system @xmath27 to generate strongly chaotic beats in the presence of large damping that allows only generation of periodic states or quasi - periodic beats . in what follows ,",
    "we propose a solution to this problem .",
    "let us consider the system @xmath27 and its copy @xmath28 and join both systems linearly in the following way : @xmath29 in nonlinear optics , systems of this type are usually called two - core couplers . therefore , the subsystem @xmath27 interacts with the subsystems @xmath28 _ via _ the @xmath30-terms and _ vice versa _",
    "@xmath28 interacts with @xmath27 _ via _ the @xmath31-terms .",
    "if , for example , @xmath31-terms are turned off then the interaction is unidirectional and , consequently , @xmath27 plays the role only of a _ receiver _ whereas @xmath28 is simply a _",
    "transmitter_. this type of interaction can be useful to generate chaotic beats within @xmath27 even if the _ free _",
    "system @xmath27 is not able to generate ( due to the large damping ) chaotic beats itself .",
    "let us consider two simple examples .",
    "let us first consider the dynamics of the system described by equations ( [ s1])-([s4 ] ) if the interaction between the subsystems @xmath27 and @xmath28 is turned off ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "then , the system @xmath27 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath26 , @xmath37 and for the initial conditions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , generates a periodic state ( or tends to this periodic state , as a steady state , if it starts from arbitrary initial conditions ) .",
    "the periodic behaviour in @xmath40-component is shown in fig.2a .    the system @xmath28 for @xmath33 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath36 , @xmath26 and @xmath43 and for the initial conditions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , generates quasi - periodic beats ( the spectrum of lyapunov exponents has the form @xmath44 ) . the beats are presented in fig.2b",
    ".    to get chaotic beats , we now turn on the coupling in ( [ s1])-([s2 ] ) unidirectionally , in such a way that the subsystem @xmath27 plays the role of a _ receiver _ ( @xmath45 ) whereas @xmath28 is a _ transmitter _",
    "( @xmath46 ) .",
    "then , the quasi - periodic beats are transmitted from the subsystem @xmath28 into the periodic subsystem @xmath27 but not _ vice versa_. the coupling can be turned on at an arbitrarily requested time @xmath47 . for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath46 the initially periodic system @xmath27 begins to generate chaotic beats ( fig.3c ) .",
    "the choticity of the beats is confirmed by the spectrum of lyapunov exponents @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the mle ( @xmath51 ) is two orders of magnitude greater than its counterpart obtained in section ii .",
    "the situation presented in fig.2c changes rapidly if at the time @xmath48 , the feedback ( @xmath52 ) is turned on between the subsystems @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "numerically , we have put @xmath53 .",
    "the new geometric structure of beats in @xmath40-component is now presented in fig.2d . as seen , after @xmath54 the transient behaviour vanishes and",
    "finally we observe beats .",
    "also the structure of the beats in the subsystem @xmath28 changes due to the mutual interactions between the subsystems @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "after @xmath55 we observe in @xmath56-component repeated sequences of two different beats ( fig.2e ) .",
    "it is obvious that beats in figs.2d - e are typically quasi - periodic , in contrast to those in fig.2c .",
    "the lack of chaoticity is confirmed by the spectrum of lyapunov exponents @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the feedback interaction between @xmath27 and @xmath28 damages the chaos within beats in the subsystem @xmath27 .",
    "+ the degree of stability of beats for different values of the coupling parameter @xmath30 if @xmath46 is shown in fig.3 ( blue line ) .",
    "beats appear for @xmath58 . for @xmath59 the beats",
    "are quasi - periodic , and in the range @xmath60 they behave chaotically . in this region",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath61 increases exponentially with increasing value of the coupling parameter @xmath30 , and generated beats become more and more chaotic .",
    "the numerical investigation shows that the system generates chaotic beats since @xmath62 . for @xmath63",
    "the beats disappear at all but the system still remains chaotic . + it is worth noting that all the maximal lyapunov exponents in fig.3 become negative if we turn on additionally the feedback interaction ( @xmath64 ) between the receiver and the transmitter",
    ". both subsystems still generate beats but they are not chaotic",
    ".      the periodic behavior presented in fig.2a does not appear if , instead of the external frequency @xmath37 , we put @xmath65 .",
    "physically , it means that the detuning between the frequencies @xmath33 and @xmath10 is now much smaller . and",
    "consequently , in the subsystem @xmath27 instead of the periodic behavior , beats appear ( fig.4a ) .",
    "let us now suppose that the subsystem @xmath28 is in the same state as in subsection a ( fig.2b ) and try to generate chaotic beats in the unidirectional regime @xmath66 . for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath46 the receiver @xmath27 generates beats having complex geometrical structure but they are not chaotic which is confirmed by the lyapunov exponents @xmath67 .",
    "the coupling is simply too week to generate chaos within beats .",
    "however , a stronger coupling allow us to generate chaos .",
    "for example , for @xmath68 and @xmath46 we observe distinctly chaotic beats in the subsystem @xmath27 which is confirmed by the lyapunov coefficients @xmath69 .",
    "as follows , the mle @xmath70 is of the same order as that specified in subsection a. the geometric structure of beats in @xmath40-component is presented in fig.4 .the degree of chaoticity of beats for different values of the coupling parameter @xmath30 ( if @xmath46 ) in the range @xmath71 is illustrated in fig.3 ( green line ) .",
    "quasi - periodic beats occur for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "chaotic beats are generated in the range @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "similarly as in subsection a , on turning on the feedback interaction ( @xmath76 ) both subsystems generate beats but they lose their chaotic nature .",
    "we have proposed a procedure to obtain beats of a higher degree of chaoticity than that hitherto obtained .",
    "let us emphasize that the method presented ( unidirectional coupling between a receiver and a transmiter ) can be easily realized in arbitrarily dynamical systems .",
    "the degree of chaos in the beats generated in the proposed optical transmiter - receiver system is of the same order as in the rssler system [ rssler , 1979 ] .",
    "the coupling transmiter - receiver could be easily applied also in chua s circuits , where weakly chaotic beats have also been obtained [ cafagna & grassi , 2004 - 2006 ] .",
