    ", these materials are the focus of very active research . here",
    "we will investigate the significance of anisotropy and correlations in these materials by parameterizing and solving model hamiltonians .",

    "we follow ref .   in labeling the hopping integrals in the @xmath9-@xmath10 plane @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . ]",
    "these materials share a generic crystal structure , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sb1acplane ] , and are found in a variety of ordered phases .",
    "as-0 enters an anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) phase below 35 k ; sb-1 has a spin - liquid ground state , and spin susceptibility measurements imply that it has an exchange interaction @xmath16 ; sb-2 has no low temperature afm transition ( unlike p-2 and most of the @xmath4 - 0s ) ; n-0 is the only @xmath4 - 0 material with a superconducting transition ( 6.2 k at 6.5 kbar ) , while at lower pressures ( away from the superconducting phase ) it exhibits a spin - density wave transition.@xcite developing a unified description of this wide variety of phases is an ongoing challenge .",
    "here we calculate the electronic structure and use wannier orbitals for the frontier bands to parameterize model hubbard hamiltonians . by solving these hamiltonians with variational monte carlo ( vmc ) ,",
    "we show that there are important qualitative differences between treating the system as a @xmath5 triangular lattice and considering it as a fully anisotropic triangular lattice ( fatl ) .",
    "a discussion on the role of full anisotropy within the heisenberg model may be found in ref .  .",
    "we perform density functional theory calculations of the electronic structure and then construct localized wannier orbitals for the frontier bands . from these we parameterize tight - binding model hamiltonians , both for the @xmath5 and for the fatl ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we then solve these models with a vmc approach .",
    "the approach used here allows for the description of metallic and spin - liquid states with the same variational wavefunction , which is compared to a variational wavefunction that describes the magnetic spiral ordered insulating state .",
    "the electronic structure calculations presented here were performed in an all - electron full - potential local orbital basis using the fplo package.@xcite the densities were converged on a @xmath18 @xmath19 mesh using a generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) functional.@xcite    to move from density functional theory calculations to model hamiltonians , it is convenient to construct wannier orbitals to represent the frontier bands of the system . in principle",
    "the wannier orbitals are simply fourier transforms of the bloch wavefunctions ; however in this procedure there are still many degrees of freedom . here",
    "they are constrained by the requirements that the wannier orbitals be represented by kohn - sham orbitals in a narrow energy window ; by projecting onto the fplo basis orbitals ensures that they will form a good basis for a tight - binding model.@xcite with these nearly optimally localized wannier orbitals we compute real - space overlaps to obtain tight - binding parameters .",
    "this method has several advantages over band fitting , as has been discussed previously in the case of molecular organic crystals.@xcite      to model these systems we consider the hubbard hamiltonian . as we will show later",
    ", a half - filled single orbital per site hubbard model is suggested by the electronic structure , so it is this kind of model we will focus on .",
    "the hamiltonian is defined by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 creates ( destroys ) an electron with spin @xmath22 on site @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the electronic density , @xmath25 is the hopping amplitude and @xmath6 is the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "here we calculate a vmc solution including backflow correlations , which allows us to provide an accurate description of a system with hundreds of lattice sites.@xcite    a major issue in the hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice is the possibility of stabilizing a spin - liquid phase ( as seen in the experimental data ) .",
    "in addition , for generic values of the hopping parameters magnetic states with generic spiral order may be expected and indeed can be obtained within mean - field approaches , like for instance the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation .",
    "@xcite    here , we approach this problem by implementing correlated variational wave functions which describe both spin - liquid states and magnetic states with generic ordering vectors . in this way , we are able to treat spiral order and paramagnetic states at the same level of theory , and therefore have a sensible comparison of their energies vs @xmath6.@xcite    _ spiral magnetic states.- _ we start with the magnetic states obtained at the hf level , with the only constraint for the spin order to be coplanar in the @xmath26 plane .",
    "our magnetic hf solutions display spiral order , which ( in 2d ) may be parametrized by two pitch angles @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is the angle between nearest - neighbor spins along the hopping direction @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) . since we use finite clusters , only certain commensurate angles are allowed . for a lattice size @xmath29 , the allowed values are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath8 and @xmath32 integers .",
    "we tested various lattice sizes ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , and determined the best pair of pitch angles for each lattice size .",
    "our vmc magnetic states are then constructed by applying correlation terms on top of the hf spiral states @xmath35 .",
    "we employ a spin - spin jastrow factor to correctly describe fluctuations orthogonal to the plane where the magnetic order lies , i.e. , @xmath36 $ ] .  @xcite a further density - density jastrow factor @xmath37 $ ] ( that includes the on - site gutzwiller term @xmath38 ) is considered to adjust electron correlations .",
    "all the @xmath39 s and the @xmath40 s are optimized for each independent distance @xmath41 .",
    "the correlated state is then given by @xmath42 .    _",
    "paramagnetic states.- _ in order to describe a paramagnetic state , we construct an uncorrelated wave function given by the ground state @xmath43 of a superconducting bcs hamiltonian :  @xcite @xmath44 where both the variational hopping amplitudes @xmath45 , the pairing fields @xmath46 , and the chemical potential @xmath47 are variational parameters to be independently optimized .",
    "for the majority of the results reported here we constrain all of these variational parameters to be real .",
    "the correlated state @xmath48 allows us to describe a paramagnetic mott insulator for a sufficiently singular jastrow factor @xmath49 ( @xmath50 being the fourier transform of @xmath40 ) ,  @xcite while a metallic state can be obtained whenever @xmath51 .    a size - consistent and efficient way to further improve the correlated states @xmath52 and",
    "@xmath53 is based on backflow correlations . in this approach , each orbital that defines the unprojected states @xmath43 and @xmath35 is taken to depend upon the many - body configuration , in order to incorporate virtual hopping processes .",
    "@xcite all results presented here are obtained by fully incorporating the backflow corrections and optimizing individually every variational parameter in the mean - field bcs equation , and in the jastrow factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 , as well as in the backflow corrections .",
    "the spin - liquid candidate sb-1 has been the subject of much recent study .",
    "we will focus on this material in discussing the process of determining the appropriate model hamiltonian for this class of systems . to move towards the goal of understanding the phase diagram of sb-1 , and the origin of the various ordered phases",
    ", one needs a sensible choice of a model hamiltonian with reliable parameters . in constructing some minimal model",
    ", one must also be aware of what the model neglects , and what effect that has on the physics it predicts .",
    "here we analyze the electronic structure to determine an appropriate minimal model , and then use wannier orbitals to parameterize it .",
    "[ fig : bs_sb1 ] shows the band structure and the density of states for sb-1 in a wide energy window around the fermi energy . from this figure",
    ", we can see that there are several pairs of bands separated from the others ; these bands are the bands identified as arising from bonding ( -b ) and anti - bonding ( -ab ) hybrids of pd(dmit)@xmath0 highest occupied molecular orbitals ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( lumo ) ( highlighted in green ) .",
