    "electron systems confined to small space regions , quantum dots , and especially their transport properties have been studied extensively for the last decade.@xcite in particular , an individual ultra - small metallic grain of radius less than @xmath1  @xmath2 was attached to two leads via oxide tunnel barriers , thus forming a single electron transistor ( set).@xcite applying bias voltage , @xmath3 , between two leads allows one to study transport properties of the system , fig .",

    "alternatively , a set can be formed by depleting two - dimensional electron gas at the interface of gaas / algaas heterostructure by applying negative voltages to the metallic surface gates.@xcite    in this paper we will assume that the bias voltage is infinitesimally small , @xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to the linear response regime . in order to tunnel onto the quantum dot ,",
    "an electron in the left lead has to overcome a charging energy , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the elementary charge ; @xmath7 is the capacitance of the quantum dot .",
    "if @xmath8 then conductance through the system is exponentially suppressed .",
    "this phenomenon is called the coulomb blockade .",
    "however if we apply a voltage , @xmath9 , to the additional gate capacitively coupled to the dot , the coulomb blockade can be lifted .",
    "indeed , changing @xmath9 one can shift the position of energy minimum so that energies of the quantum dot with @xmath10 and @xmath11 electrons will become equal and an electron can freely jump from the left lead onto the dot and then jump out into the other lead .",
    "thus , current event has occurred and a peak in the conductance , @xmath12 , corresponding to this gate voltage is observed . by changing the gate voltage one can observe an oscillation of the conductance or coulomb blockade oscillations .",

    "let us note that energy levels of the quantum dots are random and obey wigner - dyson statistics with the fluctuation of order of their mean.@xcite nonetheless to go as far as possible in the analytical treatment of the problem we have to assume that energy levels in the quantum dot are equidistant .",

    "we adopt the simplest model for the interaction , namely , the constant interaction model . in this model",
    "the coulomb interaction of the electrons depends only on the total number of electrons in the quantum dot : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total number of excess electrons ; @xmath38 is the total number of positively charged ions .",
    "the second term is the contribution from external charges .",
    "they are supplied by the ionized donors and the gate : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a function of the capacitance matrix elements of the system .",

    "equivalently , the widths of the quantum dot s energy levels contributing to the conductance , @xmath51 , must be small compared to spacing between them : @xmath52 .",
    "this , together with @xmath53 assumption , allows us to characterize the state of the dot by a set of occupation numbers , @xmath54 .",
    "the model formulated above has been studied by beenakker in the sequential tunneling approximation;@xcite that is , conservation of energy was assumed in each tunneling process , and cotunneling was neglected . therefore , to find the stationary current , kinetic equation considerations can be applied . in the linear response regime",

    "the reason for writing this equation is to show that analytical calculation of the occupation numbers is hardly possible for arbitrary quantum dot s energy level structure , @xmath78 .    the only way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to assume that energy levels in the quantum dot are equidistant .",
    "then one can use the bosonization technique@xcite ( see appendix ) to find the exact analytical expression for the occupation numbers in the canonical ensemble .",
