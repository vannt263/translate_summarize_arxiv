    "if the problem has a positive solution one says that @xmath4 _ bounds an immersed surface_. the immersion problem is complicated by the fact that there are examples of curves @xmath4 that do not bound immersed surfaces , but have finite ( possibly disconnected ) covers that do bound ; i.e. there is an immersion @xmath6 as above for which @xmath8 factors through a _ covering map _ of some positive degree . in this case",
    "we say @xmath4 _ virtually bounds _ an immersed surface .",
    "one can extend the virtual immersion problem in a natural way to finite rational formal sums of geodesics representing zero in ( rational ) homology .",

    "if @xmath44 is a word - hyperbolic group , @xmath28 is a genuine norm on @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , it is shown in @xcite and @xcite that if @xmath44 is virtually free , the unit ball in this norm is a rational polyhedron , and there are codimension one faces associated to realizations of @xmath44 as the fundamental group of a complete oriented hyperbolic orbifold .",
    "dual to each such codimension one face is a unique extremal vertex of the unit ball in @xmath60 . in our case , @xmath0 may be naturally identified with the fundamental group of the modular orbifold .",
    "the unique homogeneous quasimorphism dual to this realization , scaled to have defect @xmath10 , is the _ rotation quasimorphism _",
    ", denoted @xmath27 .",
    "this rotation function is very closely related to the _ rademacher @xmath61 function _ , which arises in connection with dedekind s @xmath62 function , and is studied by many authors , e.g. @xcite , and so on ( see especially @xcite ,   3.2 for a discussion most closely connected to the point of view of this paper ) .",
    "in fact , up to a constant , the rotation quasimorphism is the _ homogenization _ of the rademacher function ; i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "the simplest way to define this function ( at least on hyperbolic elements of @xmath0 ) is as follows .",

    "in other words , up to a factor of @xmath71 , the rotation number is the _ algebraic area _",
    "enclosed by @xmath4 .",
    "algebraically , if the conjugacy class of @xmath2 has a factorization of the form @xmath72 then @xmath73 ; see @xcite 1.56 , or @xcite equation 70 ( rademacher denotes @xmath61 and @xmath74 by @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively ) .    by bavard duality , one has @xmath77 for every @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , it is shown in @xcite ( for arbitrary free groups , though the proof easily generalizes to virtually free groups ) that equality is achieved if and only if the geodesic representative @xmath4 of @xmath2 virtually bounds an immersed surface .",
    "that is , if and only if there is a hyperbolic surface @xmath5 and an isometric immersion @xmath78 wrapping @xmath7 some ( positive ) number @xmath21 times around @xmath4 .",
    "topologically , one can think of the problem of constructing such an immersed surface as a kind of _ jigsaw puzzle _ : one takes @xmath79 copies of each region @xmath65 , where @xmath21 , @xmath68 and @xmath65 are as above , and tries to glue them up compatibly with their tautological embeddings in @xmath22 in such a way as to produce a smooth orbifold with geodesic boundary .",
    "evidently , a necessary condition is that the @xmath68 are all non - negative .",
    "however , this necessary condition is not sufficient .    in @xcite",

    "it is straightforward to show that for any @xmath32 $ ] the ( stable ) commutator length of @xmath85 is equal to the ( stable ) commutator length of its image in @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , our main theorem shows that the rotation quasimorphism is extremal for a sufficiently large stabilization of any element of @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to prove the following theorem :    [ stability_theorem ] let @xmath17 be any hyperbolic conjugacy class in @xmath0 , represented by a string @xmath18 of positive @xmath19 s and @xmath20 s .",
    "then for all sufficiently large @xmath21 , the geodesic in the modular orbifold @xmath22 corresponding to the stabilization @xmath23 virtually bounds an immersed surface in @xmath22 .",
    "the proof will occupy the remainder of the section .",
    "the conjugacy class of @xmath17 has a representative of the form @xmath87 where the @xmath88 are all positive integers .",
    "we will show that the geodesic @xmath4 corresponding to @xmath17 virtually bounds an immersed surface providing @xmath89 is sufficiently big compared to @xmath90 .",
    "evidently the theorem follows from this .",
    "we fix the notation @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the sequel , and we prove the theorem under the hypothesis @xmath93 ( note that there is no suggestion that this inequality is sharp ) .    in the modular orbifold @xmath22 ,",
