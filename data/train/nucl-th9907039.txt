    "at extremely high temperature and/or baryon density , quark - gluon plasmas @xcite are considered to be energetically favorable as compared with hadronic matter .",
    "such extreme conditions prevent us from confirming the presence of quark - gluon plasmas , although it is expected in interiors of neutron stars and in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the intriguing possibility that strange quark matter , composed of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 quarks , might be the ground state of the strong interaction was pointed out by witten @xcite .",
    "if this is correct , finite strange quark matter , which is usually referred to as strangelets , would be a more stable self - bound system than a @xmath3fe nucleus . then , disruption of neutron stars and highly energetic heavy - ion collisions could leave behind many strangelets .",
    "this might allow us to detect quark - gluon plasmas in the form of strangelets under various experimental situations @xcite .",
    "the ground - state properties of strangelets were described by farhi and jaffe @xcite within the mit bag model ; finite - size effects such as surface , coulomb , and shell effects were taken into account . in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions , however , the possibly formed strangelets should be accompanied by thermally excited states . among various excitations , we take note of spin- and flavor - symmetric , longitudinal color plasmons @xcite that represent collective counteroscillations of different color degrees of freedom . in a strangelet ,",
    "these plasmons are expected not only to exhibit a dispersion relation dependent on the color dielectric property of the medium , but also to undergo a size - dependent damping as in the case of an optically excited metal cluster or nanoparticle . when the nanoparticle is small enough for the electrons to be nearly collisionless and for the electric dipole radiation to be of little significance but",
    "is too large for the shell structure to take effect , the surface plasmon excitations are damped in a time proportional to the size @xcite .",
    "their energy is resonantly absorbed by individual excitations of particle - hole pairs of the electrons having discrete energy levels due to the presence of the boundary .",
    "notice that the quark - gluon plasma in a strangelet is fully relativistic in contrast to the electron gas in a nanoparticle .",
    "consequently , new features should arise from spin - orbit interactions and from excitations involving antiquarks , both of which may affect the lifetimes of the color plasmons .",
    "longitudinal color plasma oscillations in relativistic and degenerate bulk matter of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 quarks were investigated @xcite by calculating the current - current correlation function within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) which is valid in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "the dispersion law and damping for these oscillations are essentially the same as those examined by jancovici @xcite for electromagnetic plasma oscillations in a relativistic and degenerate electron gas . in either case , the mode properties are characterized by the corresponding plasma frequency and landau damping as in a nonrelativistic plasma . in this paper , we estimate the long - wavelength , low - temperature properties of longitudinal color oscillation modes in a strangelet of macroscopic size , surrounded by the qcd vacuum , by incorporating the discrete energy levels of quarks into the current - current correlation function within the rpa .",
    "the vanishing color dielectric constant of the vacuum leads to the absence of the surface color charge ; if present , it would modify the effective color electric field inside the strangelet according to a mie - type formula .",
    "we thus find that the frequency of the longitudinal color plasmons in the strangelet is almost the same as that in bulk quark matter .",
    "the lifetime of the plasmons is determined by the dipole transitions from a quark state in the fermi sea to an unoccupied one .",
    "it is shown that the quark particle - hole pairs involved damp the plasmons at a rate inversely proportional to the strangelet size . beyond the rpa , however , the plasmons are further damped by collisions between quarks . in sec .",
    "ii , the longitudinal polarization function is calculated up to one - loop order , allowing for the discrete quark states inside a strangelet . the resulting dispersion relation and damping rate of the longitudinal color plasma oscillation",

    "such contributions may be regarded as landau damping , i.e. , a decay of the collective mode by exciting a single real particle - hole pair . in this case , the surface of the strangelet , which acts as a boundary condition determining the discrete quark levels rather than as a scatterer , renders @xmath150 nonzero quantum mechanically and independent of @xmath148 in the weak - coupling limit . as can be observed from fig .  2",

    "we remark in passing that for a strangelet with radius @xmath153 fm , which has a baryon number of less than @xmath154 , higher - order terms in @xmath155 as ignored here may well have consequence to the frequency and damping rate of the color plasmons .",
    "we next consider the damping of the longitudinal color plasmons due to collisions @xcite between quarks in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "these collisions , by color exchange , disrupt the self - consistent fields responsible for the plasmons and add @xmath156 to the rpa result @xmath150 .",
    "if one attempts to calculate @xmath156 in perturbation theory , one meets an infrared divergence that arises from the color magnetic interactions mediated by transverse gluons .",
    "at least for finite temperature @xcite , such a divergence can not be removed even by dynamical screening @xcite of the magnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "this indicates that calculations of @xmath156 up to leading order in @xmath148 require nonperturbative features of the relativistic quark - gluon plasma which may possibly develop a magnetic mass @xmath157 and thereby provide an effective cutoff @xcite . for a thermal , massless plasma at zero baryon density , where @xmath158 , one thus obtains @xmath159 from kinetic theory @xcite",
    "this rate arises from the collision integral associated with one - gluon exchange in the bulk plasma ; finite - size corrections of @xmath151 to such a bulk result for @xmath156 should be of higher order in @xmath148 than @xmath150 , which remains in the absence of the collision integral . at the nonzero strange quark mass , baryon density , and temperature of interest here",
    ", however , the values of @xmath157 and hence of @xmath156 are essentially unknown .",
    "therefore , all we can mention is that such a collisional damping or the landau damping due to individual excitations of quark particle - hole pairs dominates the total damping rate @xmath160 , according to whether the mean free path of the quarks @xmath161 is small or large compared with @xmath4 . here",
    ", it is instructive to note that no damping of the plasmons due to gluon radiation occurs in the absence of the surface color charge .",
    "we have calculated the dispersion relation and damping rate of the longitudinal color plasma oscillations in a strangelet in the regimes of weak coupling , low temperature , and long wavelength . for @xmath162",
    ", we have found that the frequency of such oscillations is almost as large as that of bulk color plasmons and that the landau damping yields a lifetime proportional to @xmath4 . however , the present analysis is accompanied by several uncertainties .",
    "we have confined ourselves to the case of low @xmath32 and @xmath14 . with increasing @xmath32 , multipole plasmon excitations should develop . at finite temperature , furthermore , gluonic excitations in the intermediate state contribute to the proper polarization @xmath16 ; within the one - loop approximation , such a contribution is simply added to the quark - loop contribution without interference @xcite .",
    "a study allowing for those excitations has yet to be done .",
    "shell effects in strangelets also remain to be taken into account ; such effects are predicted to manifest themselves remarkably for @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "it is expected from the analogy with the case of collective excitations in normal nuclei that whether strangelets are in the vicinity of closed shells or not plays a role in the properties of the color plasma oscillations .",
    "third , it is to be noted that the present analysis is restricted to the weak - coupling regime @xmath164 . in the strongly interacting nonperturbative regime @xmath165 , more relevant to a real system , the damping rate of the color plasmons could be greatly modified .",
    "these nonperturbative effects should have primary significance to the collisional damping .    to conclude , we briefly address what type of traces a strangelet , if formed in heavy - ion collision experiments @xcite performed at a beam energy of order 200 gev per nucleon on a fixed target ,",
    "could leave via excitations of the longitudinal color plasmons . immediately after central nucleus - nucleus collisions at such energies , it is expected that a quark - gluon plasma would be produced in the resulting matter of sufficiently high energy density .",
    "then , the quark - gluon plasma might develop into strangelets via pre - freeze - out evaporation of pions , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 which carry away entropy and antistrangeness from the system .",
    "this strangeness distillation mechanism , suggested by greiner @xmath168 @xmath169 @xcite , would work as long as strangelets are stable against strong decay .",
    "note that the freezeout temperature @xmath170@xmath171 mev @xcite is comparable with the frequency @xmath130 for realistic values of @xmath148 in the range @xmath172@xmath173 .",
    "longitudinal color plasma oscillations would thus be thermally excited in strangelets until the temperature fully drops . on a time scale of order @xmath174",
    ", the excited color plasmons would decay into quark particle - hole pairs , leading to emission of photons and lepton pairs via electromagnetic interactions .",
    "these electromagnetic signals , having energy of order or less than @xmath175 , might be observed in the highly energetic heavy - ion collisions at cern s sps experiments @xcite . in order to support the picture mentioned above ,",
    "however , estimates allowing for relaxation processes occurring in such a cooled and decompressed system , for other mechanisms producing photons and lepton pairs , and for the uncertainties discussed in the preceding paragraph , are required .",
