    "the @xmath1-meson nucleus optical potential has been a subject of intense study over the last years . in particular , modifications of the @xmath1 meson properties in an hadronic environment might influence the rhythm of charmonium production @xcite , as a complementary explanation for charmonium suppression in a quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",

    "( from @xmath65 mg up to @xmath66s ) we find only the @xmath67 state , with @xmath68 smaller or equal than the @xmath53 .",
    "thus , these states are in the edge of the possible experimental determination . for heavier nuclei like @xmath57ca and @xmath62sn",
    "there is a well defined @xmath67 bound state . in the case of @xmath7pb , we find the @xmath67 and @xmath69 bound states separated by 4.3 mev , while their half - widths are 3.6 and 4.9 mev , respectively .",
    "we also find states with @xmath70 for @xmath62sn and @xmath7pb , and @xmath71 for @xmath7pb .    in summary , for light and medium nuclei ( from @xmath72 up to @xmath73 ) , there are observable @xmath0 mesic nuclei @xmath74 states . for heavier nuclei , and in addition to the @xmath74 level , we also find clearly observable @xmath67 states assuming that different angular momentum can be separated .",
    "for all cases , the bound @xmath0 meson is not orbiting around the nucleus , but rather it is embedded inside of it .",
    "for instance this can be seen in the left panel of fig .",

    "( [ eq : uindepe ] ) .",
    "we see that when the energy dependence of the potential is neglected , the states become more bound by a factor ranging from 1.6 in @xmath6c to 2 in @xmath7pb , and also the widths of the states became larger by approximately a factor of two .",
    "these results can be easily understood by looking at the energy dependence of the optical potential in fig .",
    "[ fig : iiabc ] .",
    "there , we see that both , the real ( attractive ) and imaginary ( negative ) parts of the optical potential decrease , in absolute value , by a factor larger than 2 from the threshold , @xmath44 , to @xmath75  mev",
    ". thus , the energy dependence of the optical potential plays a major role and need to be taken into account .",
    "next , we examine in table  [ table : bindepe ] the importance of the selfconsistency in the calculation . to this end , we have recalculated the full spectrum by using an energy dependent optical potential deduced from the @xmath1 selfenergy in the low density limit , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the @xmath78 t - matrix in free space .",
    "this amounts to use @xmath79 , instead of @xmath80 in eq  ( [ eq : pid ] ) . in fig .",

    "after analyzing the relevance of the ingredients of the model , we also compare our results in @xmath7pb with those obtained in ref .",
    "there , a relativistic mean field calculation is carried out that leads to binding energies much larger than those obtained here .",
    "for instance , the @xmath74 state in @xmath7pb is bound by almost one hundred mev and has no width in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas we find a binding of only about ten mev with a width of 6.6  mev for the same @xmath74 level ( see table  [ table : bindepe ] ) . of course",

    "the calculated @xmath88nucleus strong optical potential is the same for @xmath0 and @xmath5 mesons because of the isospin symmetry .",
    "the found full optical potential is not very deep .",
    "the strength of the attractive potential is , at most , 20  mev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : iiabc ] ) .",
    "a positive charged @xmath5 meson also feels the nuclear attraction of the nuclei .",
    "however , the coulomb repulsion due to the positive electric charge of the nuclei is important , especially for heavy nuclei .",
    "we have considered a light nuclei , @xmath6c , and studied the @xmath5-nucleus bound states by adding the coulomb repulsive potential to the optical one .",
    "we have found that the @xmath74 state has a binding energy of @xmath89  mev and a half - width of @xmath90  mev which is larger that @xmath68 .",
    "hence this state is not a clear case for experiments because it has a significant overlap with the energies of the continuous energy spectrum .",
    "obviously for heavier nuclei , with more protons , there is not a better chance of finding @xmath91nucleus bound states .",
    "we do not study the case of nuclei lighter than @xmath6c , because the lda used here is not reliable enough for small nuclei , specially when significant cancellations among coulomb and optical potential are taking place .",
    "summarizing , with the optical potential considered in this work , there are no chances of finding @xmath5 mesic nuclei with atomic number @xmath92 equal or larger than 6 .    in the coupled channel calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , used as input for the @xmath1 meson optical potential of this work , the nuclear matter vector meson @xmath13 selfenergy was calculated as well .",
    "the in - medium @xmath13 selfenergy is found there to be repulsive for energies around the threshold and densities @xmath93 , hence that model predicts that there are not @xmath13-nucleus bound states .",
    "the su(8 ) model used here as a kernel in the coupled channel unitary calculation reduces to the su(4 ) model for @xmath94 , when the vector meson coupling constants are set to zero . to establish the relevance of the inclusion of the vector mesons , specially of the @xmath13 , in the @xmath1 meson dynamics",

    "[ fig : su4 ] , both the su(8 ) and su(4 ) @xmath1 selfenergies are displayed for comparison .",
    "there , it can be appreciated that at threshold ( @xmath44 ) and for @xmath95 , the su(4 ) potential is small and repulsive , while the su(8 ) model provides a small attraction . however , for @xmath96mev and @xmath95 , both potentials are attractive . however , the imaginary parts of both selfenergies are quite different , being much larger for the su(4 ) case ( about @xmath97  mev for @xmath84 ) than for the su(8 ) model .",
    "this is due to the behaviour at finite density of the different resonance - hole structures of the @xmath1-meson selfenergy close to the @xmath21 threshold in the su(4 ) @xcite and su(8 ) @xcite models .",
    "the large imaginary part of the su(4 ) optical potential induces an effective repulsion , which together with the small attraction of its real part leads to the no existence of @xmath11nucleus bound states within the su(4 ) model .",
    "this is in contrast to the su(8 ) model that turns out to be attractive enough to give the bound spectra shown in table  [ table : bdepe ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : bdepe ] .    a word of caution must be said here .",
    "the above discussion overlooks the fact there will be some extra contributions to the @xmath88selfenergy from the @xmath98 interaction mediated by pion exchange from the @xmath99wave @xmath100 and @xmath101 vertices ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : su4 ] ) . at threshold",
    ", these extra terms will be purely real , since there is no phase space for the reaction @xmath102 , and they would also affect to the @xmath103wave free space amplitudes derived in ref .  @xcite .",
    "because of the @xmath99wave nature of the involved vertices , we expect the @xmath103wave part of these contributions to be small near threshold , and their contribution to be effectively accounted for by the renormalization parameters used in  @xcite , that were adjusted to reproduced the lowest - lying @xmath103wave charmed baryon resonances .",
    "note , however that these new mechanisms will be source of extra imaginary part in the case of the @xmath104selfenergy .",
    "we have used a recent @xmath11nucleus optical potential , evaluated within a self - consistent unitarized coupled - channel approach to find @xmath11nucleus bound states .",
    "we have shown that selfconsistency effects and the energy dependence of the optical potential play major roles , and need certainly to be taken into account .",
    "the potential is attractive and we find bound states for all studied nuclei through the whole periodic table . on the other hand , it produces states with relatively small half widths , smaller in general than the binding energies , and in many cases smaller than the separation among levels , which makes possible their observation .",
    "the strong energy dependence of the potential is due to the large effect on the @xmath1 selfenergy of the charmed resonances , and their medium modifications  @xcite , appearing close to @xmath21 threshold  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the energy dependence reduces the strength of both the real and imaginary parts of the potential , below the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "this leads to substantially narrower states , but at the same time also with smaller binding energies .",
    "the heavy nuclei accommodate many @xmath0-bound states and the separation of the levels , for a fixed angular momentum , is about half width of the states .",
    "the best chances for observation of bound states are in the region of @xmath105 , provided an orbital angular momentum separation can be done , where there is only one @xmath103 bound state and its half width is about a factor of two smaller than the binding energy . in any case",
    "we would like to stress out that even if no broad bumps are found in the experiments , they should find some strength in the bound region stretching in energy down to the sum of the binding energy plus the half width of the bound states .",
    "short of having the values for the binding energy and width of the states , this more limited information is still very valuable to gain some knowledge on the @xmath1 nucleus optical potential , and it should stimulate experiments in this direction",
    ". this can be of particular interest for the future @xmath106anda@fair physics program .",
    "nevertheless , we should point out that the production and the experimental detection of these @xmath11nucleus bound states will likely be a quite difficult task .",
    "one might think in reactions of the type ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fopb.trap ] ) @xmath107 to be investigated in the future facility fair .",
    "since the above reactions are two - body@xmath108two - body , the outgoing @xmath109 energy is fixed , for a certain scattering angle in the laboratory system , and the creation of the @xmath0 bound state will be identified as a peak in the @xmath110 over a background of inclusive ( @xmath111 ) cross section .",
    "the high - energy storage ring ( hesr ) at fair running with full luminosity ( limited by the production rate of @xmath112 ) at momenta larger than 6.4  gev would produce about 100/s @xmath1 meson pairs around @xmath113  @xcite . assuming that one per ten million , the momentum transferred @xmath114 to the bound @xmath0",
    "the cross section for the reaction is then proportional to @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the @xmath0 bound wave function in momentum space  @xcite . since in the reactions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fair ] ) the momentum transfer is quite large , around 2 gev at threshold , and at least 1 gev for incoming antiproton momenta of 10 gev or larger , one can immediately see that the cross sections will be small , since the @xmath0 bound wave function has difficulty to accommodate such large momenta ; but the reaction is possible . given the typical size of the @xmath0 bound states ( see for instance the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fopb.trap ] ) , momentum transfers of about 0.2 gev can be easily accommodated , and in these circumstances one might expect that one per cent of the @xmath0 mesons could be trapped  @xcite .",
    "the extra six orders of magnitude of reduction , implicit in the fraction @xmath117 , would account for the expected large reduction of the @xmath0 bound wave function when the momentum increases from 0.2 gev to 1 gev ( we have assumed a factor @xmath118 ) . ] of the produced @xmath0 mesons is trapped in a bound orbit , we are then left with a production rhythm of around only one event every @xmath119 seconds or equivalently to few hundred events per year .",
    "recoilless production reactions have proved to be more efficient in the case of detecting deeply pionic bound states  @xcite .",
    "one possible reaction , where negligible momentum transfers could be achieved , is @xmath120 from the theoretical point of view we would expect sizeable formation peaks over a flat background .",
    "however , since the @xmath13 is an unstable particle , it will not be possible to create a @xmath13 beam , which makes , in practice , unfeasible the above reaction pairs per year are expected to be produced at besiii in the region of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 resonances  @xcite .",
    "even if it were possible to put a thin nuclear target of 1 @xmath123 at a distance at small as 1 meter from the collision area , we would not have more than one per year charmed meson interacting with the nuclear target . ] .",
    "the above discussion brings us to reconsider the reactions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fair ] ) , and creating in the primary @xmath124 collision , not only a @xmath125 pair , but also a virtual pion , which will induce many body modes ( particle - hole ) in the nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "such modes will carry almost no energy , but high momentum components , which would allow the virtual @xmath0 meson in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fopb.trap ] to have a significantly smaller momentum , being in this way , significantly increased the @xmath0 bound state production cross section .",
    "the main drawback would be that one is not facing now with a two - body going to two - body reaction .",
    "hence to guaranty the creation of the @xmath11nucleus bound state , it would be needed to look at the decay products , @xmath126 and @xmath127 pairs , after the absorption of the @xmath0 by the nucleus . however , once the decay products of @xmath11nucleus bound state need to be detected , one realizes that it is unnecessary to use antiprotons ( secondary beam ) as projectiles , and instead one can benefit from the use of protons ( primary beam ) , obtaining in this way a large enhancement factor ( @xmath128 ) in the incoming flux .",
    "thus , one could look at reactions of the type @xmath129 given the fact that there are more that two particles in the final state , it is possible to pick up regions of the phase space where the momentum , that needs to be accommodated in the @xmath0 bound wave function , would be sufficiently small to make significantly larger the probability of @xmath0 trapping .",
    "moreover , the above reaction is coherent ; there is no change of charge in @xmath130 and the final nuclear state is the same as the initial one .",
    "this provides a factor @xmath131 in the cross section versus a factor @xmath132 in the inclusive reaction which gives the background  @xcite . because of that , @xmath11bound states in heavier nuclei than magnesium , mentioned above , might have better chances to be detected .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that in this work we have used a model for the in medium @xmath88meson selfenergy that , it is based on a su(8 ) spin - flavor extension  @xcite of the su(2 ) weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) pion - nucleon @xmath103wave interaction in the free space . when vector mesons are not considered , our in medium selfenergy reduces , up to minor details , to that deduced in ref .",

    "this is in sharp contrast with our findings here .",

    "<S> the energies and widths of several @xmath0 meson bound states for different nuclei are obtained using a @xmath1-meson selfenergy in the nuclear medium , which is evaluated in a selfconsistent manner using techniques of unitarized coupled - channel theory . </S>",
    "<S> the kernel of the meson - baryon interaction is based on a model that treats heavy pseudoscalar and heavy vector mesons on equal footing , as required by heavy quark symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath0 bound states in all studied nuclei , from @xmath2 up to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of vector mesons is the keystone for obtaining an attractive @xmath1-nucleus interaction that leads to the existence of @xmath0-nucleus bound states , as compared to previous studies based on su(4 ) flavor symmetry . in some cases , </S>",
    "<S> the half widths are smaller than the separation of the levels , what makes possible their experimental observation by means of a nuclear reaction . </S>",
    "<S> this can be of particular interest for the future @xmath4anda@fair physics program . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a @xmath5 bound state in @xmath6c , but it is too broad and will have a significant overlap with the energies of the continuum . </S>"
