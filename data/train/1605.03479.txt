    "dynamical collective phenomena emerging from interacting units show nontrivial dependencies on the topology and other characteristics of the network of interactions .",
    "examples of this dependency in complex networks occur in synchronization phenomena @xcite , in ordering dynamics , where coarsening only occurs below a critical effective dimension@xcite , or in the appearance of new types of phase transitions , such as explosive percolation or explosive synchronization @xcite . in these phenomena ,",
    "an additional important aspect is the multilayering of the network or the existence of underlying interdependent networks @xcite . in general ,",
    "dynamical processes in this type of networks are non - reducible to dynamics in a single effective network @xcite and new forms of phase transitions and changes in the order of the transition have been found in such multilayared / interdependent networks @xcite .",
    "while most studies of dynamics in complex networks isolate a single dynamical process , many real situations involve the coupling of two processes , a situation most naturally described in the context of multilayer / interdependent networks @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the situation of interdependent networks where nodes in each layer are distinct entities which follow only one type of contagion mechanism , but due to interconnections are influenced by the nodes from both layers .",
    "we address the question of the effect of coupling two dynamical processes featuring , respectively , a discontinuous and a continuous phase transition .    as a specific illustration we focus on contagion processes that describe adoption phenomena .",
    "the adoption of an innovation or a new technology can follow from processes of _ simple _ or _ complex _ contagion @xcite . in simple contagion",
    "a node in the network adopts by interacting with a single neighbor who has already adopted , in the same way than in an infection process . on the contrary , in complex contagion",
    ", adoption requires simultaneous exposure to multiple neighboring nodes that have already adopted , so that adoption depends on the global state of the neighborhood .",
    "a prototype model for simple contagion is the sis ( susceptible - infected - susceptible ) model , known to have a continuous transition to the adoption phase for a critical value of the infection rate @xcite .",
    "complex contagion is described by a threshold model @xcite which has a discontinuous transition @xcite to the adoption phase at a critical value of the fraction of neighbors required for individual adoption .",
    "a number of recent studies @xcite consider different aspects of this model , including comparison with available data from online interactions @xcite . while coupling of two simple @xcite or two complex @xcite contagion processes in multilayared / interdependent networks has been discussed in different situations ,",
    "our goal here is to consider the coupling of a sis and a threshold contagion models , each of them running in one of two interdependent network layers .",
    "the proposed set - up is motivated by the study of the adoption of a given innovation by two interdependent populations each of which follows a different contagion mechanism , or alternatively the coupled adoption of two different innovations each one associated with a different contagion mechanism . concerning the fundamental question of the coupling of a continuous and a discontinuous phase transition , we find that not only the transition points and the nature of the transitions can change , but also new transitions appear .",
    "these changes turn out to depend on the interlayer connectivity and on the asymmetry between the average intralayer connectivity of the two layers .",

    "[ fig : ps1max ] ( d ) shows evidence of the discontinuous character of the transition when one crosses instead the transition line vertically ( at constant @xmath11 ) from * i * to * ii*. as mentioned before , although the second transition in the sis layer is caused by the transition in the threshold layer , the order of the transitions in both layers agree only when the transition line is crossed horizontally ( @xmath17 constant ) , but differs for vertical crossing ( @xmath11 constant ) . in the latter case",
    "the transition in the threshold layer is discontinuous but at the same time the sis layer experiences a continuous transition with a big slope exhibiting substantial jumps in the average @xmath169 .",
    "in summary , we have considered the competition between two different , simple and complex , adoption processes as a specific case of competition of a continuous and a first order transition on interdependent networks , and we have developed a mean - field approach appropriate to describe this situation .",
    "we have found that with the presence of interlayer connections the system reveals a wider range of parameters where global adoption takes place .",
    "furthermore , both threshold and sis layers change their behavior quantitatively and qualitatively . in the threshold layer the critical value @xmath12 increases with the interlayer connectivity @xmath33 , whereas in the case of an isolated single network it would decrease with average connectivity .",
    "the transition remains discontinuous except in the case of asymmetric intralayer connectivities @xmath151 and large intralayer connectivity @xmath33 , when it becomes continuous .",
    "we also find that the critical threshold reaches a local maximum , @xmath170 , located at intermediate values of @xmath33 . in the sis",
    "layer the original transition remains continuous but it moves to @xmath171 for any @xmath172 , signaling the disappearance of the neutral state .",
    "a new transition in sis layer between regions of low and large number of adopters appears caused by the interlayer coupling .",
    "this new transition can be continuous or discontinuous according to the particular values of the inter and intralayer connectivities .",
    "remarkably the nature of the transitions in both layers might depend on the direction in which the transition lines are crossed .",
    "our results indicate that interconnection can result in new transitions and modifications of the nature of pre - existing transitions , opening the way to further research on universal characteristics of the coupling of network transitions of different order and their dependence on inter and intralayer connectivities .",
    "this work was supported by feder ( eu ) and mineco ( spain ) under grant esotecos fis2015 - 63628-c2-r .",
    "we develop in this appendix an approach based on a mean - field type approximation in which local fractions are replaced by global averages .",
    "let us first introduce the general notation .",
    "we denote by @xmath173 , @xmath174 the states of agents in the first layer and @xmath175 , @xmath176 those in the second layer .",
    "an agent @xmath26 in layer @xmath25 is said to be in the adopter state at time @xmath177 if @xmath178 ; otherwise , it is in the neutral ( non - adopter ) state when @xmath179 .",
    "we will use @xmath180 for the fraction of neighbors of agent @xmath181 who are adopters , i.e. @xmath182 , being @xmath183 the set of neighbors of @xmath181 in both layers and @xmath184 the value of the state of such a neighbor which might belong to the first layer , @xmath185 , or to the second layer , @xmath186 .",
    "once selected , the state @xmath173 updates according to the following dynamical rule : if @xmath180 is smaller than the threshold @xmath11 nothing happens ; otherwise , it becomes an adopter .",
    "this can be written as @xmath187 note that , according to this rule , once a node becomes an adopter it can not go back to the neutral state . therefore , with the course of time the fraction of adopters in the system can either increase or stay unchanged , but never decrease .",
    "we now aim at deriving an approximate equation for the evolution of the fraction of the number of adopters in layer 1 , @xmath188 .",
    "we follow closely @xcite in the derivation .",
    "the ensemble average @xmath51 evolves according to the general , exact , relation : @xmath189 + where @xmath190 denotes the particular realization of the state variables and @xmath191 means a conditional average . considering that time ( as measured in monte caro units )",
    "increases by @xmath192 after one individual update , we can write eq .",
    "( [ thr1_appendix ] ) in the form @xmath193 with @xmath194",
    "we now make a mean - field type approximation and consider that the fraction of neighbors which are adopters @xmath180 is independent of the site @xmath26 .",
    "hence , the probability that the fraction of adopters in the neighbourhood of the randomly chosen node @xmath26 is at least @xmath11 is approximated by @xmath195\\approx\\text{prob}\\left[\\langle s_{1}(t)\\rangle_\\textrm{n}\\ge \\theta\\right]$ ] , being @xmath196 the average value of @xmath180 over all sites @xmath174 . using the dynamical rules described in eq .",

    "( [ thr2_appendix ] ) and treating the left hand side as a time derivative we obtain @xmath198,\\label{thr3_appendix}\\ ] ] which is eq.([g1 ] ) in the main text .",
    "we recall that the rules of the adoption process in the sis layer are the following : at time @xmath177 an agent from layer 2 is randomly selected , let @xmath175 be the state of this agent .",
    "if @xmath32 ( adopter ) it goes back to the neutral state @xmath199 .",
    "if @xmath31 ( neutral ) then it visits sequentially all its neighbors , having a probability @xmath17 of becoming an adopter from the interaction with anyone of them ( of course , if it becomes adopter in a given interaction , it is not necessary to continue the sequence of interactions with the neighbors ) .",
    "namely , @xmath200        according to the dynamical rules eq .",
    "( [ sisrules_appendix ] ) , the conditional average is @xmath203},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where prob[a]=prob[adoption occurs from any neighbour]=@xmath204prob[adoption does not occur from any neighbour ] .",
    "if @xmath205 is the number of adopter neighbours in any layer of site @xmath206 the probability that adoption does not occur for that site is @xmath207 . in the mean - field approximation",
    "we will replace this probability by the average probability @xmath208 over all nodes .",
    "we will further assume that the number of adjacent adopters is given by a poisson distribution ( as in er networks ) , @xmath209 , leading to @xmath210 we replace @xmath211 .",
    "thus probability that adoption happens is @xmath212}=1-e^{-\\lambda\\left(k_2 \\langle s_2 \\rangle + m",
    "\\langle s_1\\rangle\\right)}. \\label{g2_appendix}\\ ] ] replacing in eq .",
    "( [ sis2_appendix ] ) and identifying the left side as a time derivative we obtain the mean - field equation for the fraction of adopters in the sis layer @xmath213 which is eq.([sis4 ] ) in the main text .",
