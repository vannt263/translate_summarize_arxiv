    "in the natural space environment , e.g. , planetary magnetospheres , and the solar wind ( and actually many other kinds of astrophysical objects ) , plasmas are generally observed to possess a particle distribution function with a non - maxwellian high - energy tail .",
    "the distribution function typically has a power - law tail in energy [ distribution @xmath5 ( particle energy)@xmath6 , and frequently can be modeled by a generalized lorentzian ( kappa ) distribution . for a variety of observational data , see _ vasyliunas _ [ 1968 ] , _ gosling et al . _",

    "physical mechanisms that can produce power - law particle distributions include stochastic acceleration by plasma wave turbulence , and collisionless shocks .",
    "kappa - like distribution functions which are maxwellian at low energies and power law at high energies can also be produced by velocity - space lvy flight probability distributions [ e.g. , _ collier _ , 1993 ] .",
    "it is the process of stochastic acceleration by plasma wave turbulence with which we shall be concerned in this paper .",
    "many researchers have studied stochastic acceleration of charged particles by various modes of plasma wave , e.g. , _ gurevich _ [ 1960 ] , _ kennel and engelmann _ [ 1966 ] , _ melrose _ [ 1980 , 1986 ] , _ steinacker and miller _ [ 1992 ] , and _ schlickeiser _ [ 1997 ] . _",
    "hasegawa et al . _ [ 1985 ] showed that superthermal radiation can enhance velocity - space diffusion so as to produce a power - law distribution .",
    "however , these authors did not estimate values of the intensity of the radiation field and other plasma parameters necessary to obtain a reasonable value for the power law .",
    "the source of the free energy to excite such intense radiation was another question left unaddressed .",
    "_ melrose _ [ 1980 ] pointed out that the equilibrium distribution is a power law only if the momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath2 is the particle velocity .",
    "for example , for langmuir waves , @xmath9 ; but this requires the turbulent spectrum @xmath10 to be independent of the wave number @xmath11 , which is an unlikely possibility [ _ melrose _ , 1980 ] .",
    "stochastic acceleration by plasma waves is characteristically slow due to the diffusive nature of the scattering process .",
    "nevertheless , the process may be applicable , for instance , in planetary magnetospheres in cases when typical electron acceleration times are of the order of tens of hours .",
    "we note that _ schlickeiser _ [ 1997 ] has recently obtained a diffusion coefficient varying as @xmath9 when the charged particles are accelerated by whistler - mode waves . the momentum diffusion coefficient results from the resonant interaction between particles and whistler - electron cyclotron plasma waves .",
    "similar formulae have also been obtained by _",
    "dermer et al . _",
    "numerical calculations of the momentum diffusion coefficients for particle - whistler interaction were given by _",
    "steinacker and miller _ [ 1992 ] and _ pryadka and petrosian _ [ 1997 ] , but no analytical formulae were obtained for medium energetic electrons ( @xmath12 kev to a few hundreds of kev ) , which limits their application by other authors .",
    "there are several physical processes that can drive the whistler instability .",
    "for example , anisotropies in the plasma velocity distribution can make whistlers unstable .",
    "moreover , a kappa distribution can itself enhance the whistler - mode instability , as compared with the maxwellian distribution [ e.g. , see _ summers and thorne , _ 1992 ; _ xue et al . , _ 1993",
    "; _ mace , _ 1998 ] .    in the following section",
    ", we shall develop a non - relativistic theory for the formation of kappa distributions by means of whistler - mode wave stochastic acceleration .",
    "we assume a kolmogorov - type magnetic turbulence power spectrum in the wave number for the whistler - mode waves , namely , @xmath13 with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the parallel wave number , and @xmath17 is the energy density of the whistler turbulence .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath18 for whistler waves , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the alfvn speed and the non - relativistic ion gyrofrequency . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the situation in which pitch - angle anisotropy is small and the particle distribution is isotropic . for higher energy electrons ,",
    "it is generally the case that the time - scale for pitch angle diffusion is much less than that for momentum diffusion , and so the assumption of isotropy is justified . for lower energy electrons , where the pitch angle and momentum diffusion rates are comparable , we assume that isotropization by coulomb collisions occurs . the momentum diffusion coefficient can then be averaged over the pitch angle .",
    "herein , we employ the diffusion coefficient given by _ schlickeiser _ [ 1997 ] , namely , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the non - relativistic electron gyrofrequency , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the speed of light , and @xmath26 is a weakly varying function of @xmath2 .",
    "henceforth in this paper , the kolmogorov turbulent spectrum ( @xmath27 ) is adopted .",
    "it then follows that @xmath26 is of order unity . in accordance with the whistler wave dispersion relation and the resonance condition",
    "@xcite , we find that electrons can resonate with whistlers provided that @xmath28 . the diffusion coefficient ( [ diff ] ) is valid in the region where @xmath29 .",
    "however , lower - energy electrons can be accelerated by high wave - number whistlers as the electron cyclotron branches of the dispersion relation are approached@xcite .",
    "coulomb interactions result in both momentum diffusion and friction in the kinetic equation for the particle distribution function .",
    "as we are assuming the distribution to be isotropic , we can ignore the angular contribution to coulomb collisions @xcite , giving the equation , @xmath30 where the frictional coefficient @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 @xmath33 is the slowing - down rate , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the respective perpendicular and parallel diffusion coefficients .",
    "when the velocity of the particle @xmath2 is much larger than the thermal velocities of the electrons and ions [ @xmath36 , we have by _ hinton _ [ 1983 ] , @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electron number density , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the coulomb logarithm . finally , modifying equation ( [ coul ] ) to include acceleration by whistler - mode waves , we obtain the following fokker - planck equation to describe the evolution of the distribution function : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is given by equation ( [ diff ] ) . with a zero - flux boundary condition ,",
    "the stationary solution of equation ( [ fv ] ) is given by @xmath45 substituting the expression ( 2 ) for @xmath44 in equation ( [ f1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath46\\over        { 1 + { v^2\\over{(\\kappa+1 ) v_e^2 } } } } } \\right\\ } \\cr    & & \\cr    & = & a\\left[1+{v^2\\over { \\kappa \\theta^2 } } \\right]^{-(\\kappa+1)},\\label{fs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 @xmath48 is a constant of integration , @xmath49 is the power of the wave turbulence , and @xmath50^{1/2}v_e$ ] .",
    "normalizing the distribution using @xmath51 gives @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the gamma function .",
    "the distribution ( [ fs ] ) is formally a generalized lorentzian ( kappa ) distribution , with the spectral index @xmath3 given by equation ( [ kp ] ) .",
    "parenthetically , it can be noted that setting @xmath54 in equation  ( [ f1 ] ) leads to the recovery of the maxwellian distribution @xmath55 . from equation ( [ kp ] )",
    "we determine that @xmath3 is given by @xmath56 where @xmath40 is in @xmath57 , and @xmath58 in gauss .",
    "in the foregoing , we have determined that stochastic acceleration by whistler - mode turbulence can produce a particle distribution with a power - law tail , i.e. , @xmath1 . by equation  ( [ kvalue ] )",
    ", we note that the value of the spectral index @xmath3 depends strongly on the relative wave intensity @xmath4 . in , for various space plasmas",
    ", we have listed typical values of the parameters @xmath59 and the thermal energy(temperature ) .",
    "the basic plasma parameters in this table for the solar wind were taken from _",
    "kivelson and russell _ [ 1995 ] , for the earth s plasma sheet from _ christon et al . _",
    "[ 1988 ] , for the jovian magnetosphere from _ dessler _ [ 1983 ] and _ divine and garrett _ [ 1983 ] , and for the saturnian magnetosphere from _ sittler et al . _",
    "because only the energetic electrons with velocities satisfying @xmath28 can resonate with first - harmonic whistlers , we list in table 1 the critical energy @xmath60 corresponding to the critical velocity @xmath61 . if the critical energy @xmath60 is much larger than the electron thermal energy , then the whistlers can only accelerate non - thermal high energy particles , for which the coulomb momentum diffusion coefficient @xmath35 is much less than the acceleration diffusion coefficient . in this case",
    ", an injection mechanism is required to pre - accelerate the particle to the required critical energy @xmath60 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this situation applies , for instance , to solar flares .",
    "in fact , there is no observational evidence that electrons have a kappa distribution in solar flares .",
    "if the critical energy @xmath60 is of the same order as the thermal energy , then whistlers can accelerate the thermal particles into the high - energy tail of the distribution , and so a kappa distribution can be produced .",
    "this is essentially the case for all the space plasmas shown in . for a specific plasma characterized by its electron number density @xmath40 and background magnetic field @xmath58 , formula ( [ kvalue ] ) gives the spectral index @xmath3 produced by whistler turbulence of power @xmath4 . in figure",
    "[ fig ] , for each of the given space plasmas , we show the range of @xmath4-values associated with the range of @xmath3-values that might be typically observed , namely @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , we also show the value of the critical energy @xmath60 for each plasma .",
    "the results imply that relatively weak whistler - mode turbulence could produce power - law spectra in the earth s plasma sheet and in the jovian and saturnian magnetospheres , whereas stronger turbulence is required in the solar wind .    in conclusion , we should point out both the merits and the limitations of this study .",
    "of course , it is not the case that all electron power - law spectra are produced by whistler - mode turbulence , or that whistler - mode turbulence will always give rise to electron power - law spectra .",
    "nevertheless , under certain restrictions , we have shown that the production of electron power - law energy spectra by stochastic acceleration due to whistlers is a viable possibility .",
    "apart from the non - relativistic fromework , limitations of the study include the assumptions of isotropy , a zero - flux boundary condition , and a momentum diffusion coefficient based on wave propagation strictly parallel to the background magnetic field .",
    "the intrinsic value of the study is that it is one of the first in the literature to present a firm theoretical basis for the formation of generalized lorentzian ( or kappa ) particle distribution functions in space plasmas .",
