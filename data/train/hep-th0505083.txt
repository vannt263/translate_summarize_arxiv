    "a surprising interpretation of a possible connection @xcite between topological strings on calabi - yau threefolds and statistical models of crystal melting , known as random plane partitions , has been advocated .",
    "it is conjectured @xcite that the statistical model is nothing but a quantum gravitational path integral involving fluctuations of k@xmath0hler geometry and topology , by interpreting plane partitions as gravitational quantum foams in k@xmath0hler gravity @xcite , that is the target space field theory of topological @xmath7-model strings @xcite .",
    "it is shown @xcite that the topological vertex counting @xcite of the @xmath7-model partition function on a local toric calabi - yau threefold , which involves from the worldsheet viewpoint sums over holomorphic maps to the target space , is reproduced from quantum fluctuations of k@xmath0hler gravity on the fixed macroscopic background by assuming that the fluctuations are quantized in the unit of the string coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "the topological vertex countings are known @xcite to bring about the gauge instanton contributions to the exact partition functions @xcite for supersymmetric gauge theories . however , the exact partition functions themselves are fully reproduced @xcite by random plane partitions . thinking over the conjecture ,",
    "this indicates that even background geometries in k@xmath0hler gravity also have a microscopic origin in the statistical models , given by certain plane partitions , and emerge from the quantum foams by taking the semi - classical limit @xmath9 .",
    "further developing consideration along this line might lead to an explanation of microscopic generation of the target spaces for perturbative string theories . from the gauge theory viewpoint",
    ", it could deepen our understanding of the geometric engineering @xcite and will provide another formulation for gauge / gravity correspondence in string theories .    in this article",
    "we take the first step towards that direction .",

    "physical states of the theory are given by the global sections , and the physical hilbert space @xmath13 is identified with @xmath14    in the quantization , we regard the variety of dimension @xmath15 , equipped with the quantized k@xmath0hler form , as a phase space .",
