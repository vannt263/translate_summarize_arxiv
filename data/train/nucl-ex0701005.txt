    "the observation of the @xmath1-process would not only reveal the nature of the neutrino as a majorana particle but could also provide information about the absolute neutrino mass scale ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . + the germanium isotope @xmath2ge is a prominent candidate for the observation of the @xmath1-process .",
    "experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta - decay of @xmath2ge use high purity germanium detectors as source and detector simultaneously .",
    "their sensitivity is limited by unidentified background events which in previous experiments were mostly induced by external @xmath0-radiation . the heidelberg - moscow and igex experiments set 90%  c.l .",

    "+ the germanium detector array , gerda  @xcite , is a new germanium double beta - decay experiment being installed in hall a of the infn gran sasso national laboratory ( lngs ) , italy .",
    "its main design feature is to operate germanium detectors directly in liquid argon which serves as cooling medium and as a shield against external @xmath0-radiation .",
    "a detailed description of the experiment can be found in  @xcite .",
    "+ the detectors for the second phase of the experiment ( phase  ii ) will be enriched in @xmath2ge to a level of about 86% and will have a mass of approximately 2  kg each .",
    "for the first time , highly segmented germanium detectors will be used in a double beta - decay experiment .",
    "the segmentation scheme is chosen to minimize the background level in the energy region around @xmath6  kev .",
    "the current detector design foresees a 6-fold segmentation in the azimuthal angle @xmath7 and a 3-fold segmentation in the height @xmath8 .",
    "all segments and the core are read out separately to allow a better identification of photons . the estimated gain in background reduction for the gerda experiment",
    "is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper the results of a study with a gerda phase  ii prototype detector are presented .",
    "the identification of events with photons in the final state is investigated .",
    "section  [ section : background ] summarizes the photon identification using coincidences between segments .",
    "the underlying physics processes and their signatures are described as are the event selection and the analysis strategy .",

    "segmented detectors can be used to identify events with photons in the final state by requiring coincidences between the segments of a detector .",
    "this technique is well established in nuclear experiments such as agata  @xcite and greta  @xcite , and provides a basis for @xmath0-ray tracking  @xcite .",
    "+ the potential of segmented detectors for double beta - decay experiments has also been investigated by the majorana collaboration  @xcite using a clover detector , consisting of four detectors with two longitudinal segments each , and monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "+      the signatures of events encountered in double beta - decay experiments can be classified according to the particles in the final state .",
    "a detailed classification for these events is given in  @xcite .",
    "for the identification of photon events only two such classes are considered here :    *",
    "class  l : local energy deposit .",
    "three different types of events are part of this class : ( a ) events with only electrons in the final state .",
    "electrons in the mev - energy region have a range of the order of a millimeter in germanium  @xcite .",
    "energy is therefore deposited locally .",
    "double beta - decay events which have two electrons in the final state are of this type ( these events correspond to class  i events in reference  @xcite ) .",
    "( b ) events with photons in the final state in which a photon compton - scatters only once inside the fiducial volume of the detector .",
    "energy is thus deposited locally .",
    "( c ) double escape events : if a photon produces an electron - positron pair and both photons from the subsequent annihilation escape , energy is deposited locally . *",
    "class  m : multiple energy deposits .",
    "photons emitted in radioactive decays have energies in the mev - energy region and interact dominantly through compton scattering in germanium .",
    "the range of these photons is of the order of centimeters .",
    "the different interactions are separated by distances large compared to the scale of class  l events .",
    "this class is composed of classes  ii - iv in reference  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that with the technique presented in this paper the three event types in class  l can not be separated but only be distinguished from class  m events .      due to the well separated multiple energy deposits class  m events",
    "are expected to deposit energy predominantly in more than one segment .",
    "class  l events will predominantly deposit energy in only one segment .",
    "events in which more than one segment measures deposited energy can thus be identified as class  m events .",
    "the gerda phase  ii prototype detector under study is a high purity @xmath9-type germanium crystal with a true coaxial geometry .",
    "it is 70  mm high and has an outer diameter of 75  mm .",
    "the inner diameter is 10  mm .",

    "it is placed inside a two - walled aluminum cryostat with a combined thickness of 6  mm .",
    "the operation voltage of the detector is ( + ) @xmath10  v. + a schematic diagram of the detector and the experimental setup is given in figure  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the core and each segment are read out using charge sensitive psc  823 pre - amplifiers .",
    "the pre - amplified signals are digitized using a data acquisition system based on 5 14-bit adc pixie-4 modules at a sampling rate of 75  mhz . in this configuration",
    "the energy resolution of the core is approximately 2.6  kev ( fwhm at @xmath11  kev ) , the energy resolution of the segments varies between 2.4  kev and 4.7  kev with an average segment energy resolution of 3.3  kev .",
    "the threshold of the core and the segments was set to 20  kev .",
    "cross - talk between the core and the segment pre - amplifiers and a constraint in the daq system , which resulted in the inability to handle late arriving signals , caused a fraction of less than 10% of individual segment signals to not be recorded .",
    "+ a detailed description of the setup and the prototype properties will be published  @xcite .",
    "several measurements were performed with different radioactive sources positioned 10  cm above the center of the detector .",
    "energy and time information in all segments and the core were recorded on an event - by - event basis .",
    "an event was recorded , if the energy measured in the core exceeded the threshold .",
    "measurements were performed with three different sources : ( 1 ) a 60  kbq @xmath12co source , ( 2 ) a 100  kbq @xmath13th source and ( 3 ) a 75  kbq @xmath14eu source .",

    "+ the drift anisotropy of charge carriers inside the germanium diode  @xcite can cause electrons and holes to deviate from their drift path .",
    "it is therefore possible to measure energy in one segment even if the energy was deposited in the neighboring segment .",
    "hence , a correction is applied to the segment energies .",
    "an effective model is used which assigns a segment to each energy deposit depending on its position with respect to the axes of the crystal and the segment borders .",
    "the maximum angular shift is 3.5@xmath17 .",
