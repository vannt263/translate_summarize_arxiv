    "the wright - fisher population model is used as a benchmark to measure the speed of the random genetic drift in actual biological populations as well as in population models with more structure than the classical setup allows @xcite .",

    "the resulting process @xcite has no parameters and the wright - fisher population size @xmath0 is mirrored in the time scale ensuring the coalescent approximation .",
    "the larger is @xmath0 , the slower the rate of genetic drift , since it takes longer for an allele to get fixed in the population - in the coalescent tree this is reflected in longer branch lengths ( as counted in generations ) .    if the genealogy of another , usually more structured , population model is approximated by the standard kingman coalescent , then the time scale of the latter @xmath1 takes the role of the wright - fisher population size .",
    "this is why it is called the _ coalescent effective population size _",
    "( see @xcite as well as @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the effective size @xmath1 is usually smaller than the actual population size @xmath0 as @xmath1 incorporates a number of factors not present in the wright - fisher model that increase variability in the underlying genetic sampling process and thereby speed up genetic drift .",

    "the so called inbreeding effective population size ( crow and kimura @xcite and ewens @xcite ) is the one that is closest in spirit to the coalescent effective population size .",
    "a case studied by several authors ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and nicely summarized in @xcite is that of a geographically structured wright - fisher model with fast migration .",
    "it deals with a population living on @xmath2 islands with a constant total population size @xmath0 and where also population sizes on the islands @xmath3 are constant over time .",

    "( when the ancestral process is approximated by the _ structured coalescent _ ) the effective population size formulae may give the impression that the effective population size significantly exceeds actual size ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon can be viewed as an artifact of the random sampling design : if two lineages are sampled from different sub - populations , it takes some time before they enter the same sub - population and get a chance to merge .",
    "[ motex ]     we take a further step towards more realistic models by allowing _ variable migration _ probabilities .",
    "the idea is illustrated in figure [ motex ] , presenting two versions of two - island populations ( i. e. @xmath17 ) .",
    "the right panel depicts a situation where for a given year each of the two islands can have an environmental advantage with equal probabilities , the advantage being that the offspring from the favored part can migrate to the other island but not vice verse .",
    "the left panel represents the corresponding constant environment case obtained by averaging over environmental fluctuations .",
    "our main result , theorem [ main ] in section [ sv ] , on geographically structured populations with variable migration can be summarized as follows .",
    "if the backward migration matrix @xmath18 is random , then the stationary distribution @xmath10 also becomes a _",
    "random vector _ and the coalescent effective population size formula takes the form @xmath19 here the expectation operator is taken with respect to the randomly varying environment . if the random stationary probabilities are directly averaged into @xmath20 , and then inserted in ( [ cf ] ) , the result is an _ annealed _ ( or in physics language _ mean - field _ ) expression , @xmath21    the expressions @xmath22 and @xmath23 thus pertain to the annealed and _ quenched _ approaches , respectively .",
    "formula is interpreted as applied to the population with a constant environment obtained by averaging over all possible environmental scenarios ( left panel in figure [ motex ] ) .",
