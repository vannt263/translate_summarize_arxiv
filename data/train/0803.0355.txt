    "the objective of this paper is to study the korn - poincar inequality : @xmath14 under the tangential boundary conditions : @xmath15 in domains @xmath1 that are shells of small thickness of order @xmath2 , around an arbitrary smooth and closed hypersurface @xmath3 in @xmath4 . by @xmath16",
    "we denote the symmetric part of the gradient @xmath6 .",
    "korn s inequality was discovered in the early @xmath17th century , in the context of the boundary value problem of linear elastostatics @xcite .",
    "there is by now an extensive literature on the subject , relating to various contexts and various boundary conditions ( see for example a review @xcite , and the references therein ) . if ( [ intro_tan ] ) is replaced by @xmath18 on @xmath19 , one can easily prove that @xmath20 , and so ( [ intro_korn ] ) follows by the poincar inequality . in the absence of this boundary condition , or with its weaker versions , the bound ( [ intro_korn ] ) requires an extra criterion . roughly speaking",
    ", it serves to eliminate pure rotations , when @xmath21 but @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , ( [ intro_korn ] ) holds for all @xmath23 vector fields @xmath10 with ( [ intro_tan ] ) , which are @xmath24- orthogonal to the space of those linear vector fields on @xmath1 with skew - symmetric gradient that are themselves tangent on the boundary .",
    "we are interested in the behaviour of the constant @xmath8 , as @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out that in general , @xmath8 may blow up , even if @xmath1 are not rotationally symmetric ( that is when the aforementioned spaces are trivial ) . the correct way of looking at this problem is to consider the asymptotic inequality as @xmath9 , i.e. the related korn inequality on @xmath3 ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath25 this inequality holds true for all tangent vector fields @xmath26 on @xmath3 , which are @xmath24-orthogonal to the the space of killing fields on @xmath3 . a killing field is defined to be a smooth tangent vector field which generates a one - parameter family of isometries on @xmath3 .",
    "it is well known that the space of killing fields on a given surface is a finite dimensional lie algebra .",
    "an equivalent characterisation of killing fields on @xmath3 is : @xmath27    in this paper , we first notice that any @xmath26 satisfying ( [ intro_tre ] ) admits a family of extensions @xmath28 , such that the boundary conditions ( [ intro_tan ] ) hold and so that the ratio @xmath29 goes to infinity as @xmath9 .",
    "this construction turns out to be the worst case scenario for the possible blow - up of @xmath8 .",
    "our main results state that the constants @xmath8 remain uniformly bounded for vector fields @xmath10 inside any family of cones ( with angle @xmath11 , uniform in @xmath2 ) around the orthogonal complement of the space of extensions of killing fields on @xmath3 .",
    "our main motivation in this work has been its application to dynamics of navier - stokes equations in thin @xmath30-dimensional domains .",
    "thin domains are encountered in many problems in solid or fluid mechanics .",
    "for example , in ocean dynamics , one is dealing with the fluid regions which are thin compared to the horizontal length scales .",
    "other examples include lubrication , meteorology , blood circulation etc . ; they are a part of a broader study of the behaviour of various pdes on thin @xmath31-dimensional domains , where @xmath32 ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the global existence and asymptotic properties of solutions to the navier - stokes equations in thin @xmath30d domains began with raugel and sell in @xcite .",
    "they proved global existence of strong solutions for large initial data and in presence of large forcing , for the sufficiently thin @xmath30d product domain @xmath33 , with the boundary conditions either purely periodical or combined periodic - dirichlet .",
    "further generalisations to other boundary conditions followed ( see the references in @xcite ) . towards analysing thin domains other than simple product domains , iftimie , raugel and sell @xcite treated domains of the type : @xmath34 , with the mixed boundary conditions : periodic on the lateral boundary and the navier boundary conditions : @xmath35 on the top and on the bottom .",
    "the korn inequality arises naturally when one considers the incompressible flow subject to ( [ intro_navier ] ) , for the following reason ( see @xcite ) . in order to define the stokes operator relevant to the boundary conditions ( [ intro_navier ] ) , one uses the symmetric bilinear form @xmath36 rather than the usual @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the energy methods give suitable bounds for @xmath38 , for a solution flow @xmath12 in @xmath1 . on the other hand , in order to establish compactness while studying the limit problem as @xmath39 , one needs bounds for the @xmath40 norm of @xmath12 , with constants independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the inequality ( [ intro_korn ] ) ( with uniform constants @xmath8 ) provides thus a necessary uniform equivalence of the two norms @xmath41 and @xmath42 on @xmath1 .    in this spirit",
    ", it is hoped that we can apply the result of this paper to study the dynamics of the navier - stokes equations , under the navier boundary conditions , in thin shells with various geometries of the reference surface @xmath3 and of the boundaries of @xmath1 .",
    "starting with the original papers of korn @xcite , korn s inequality has also been widely used as a basic tool for the existence of solutions of the linearised displacement - traction equations in elasticity @xcite . in this context , for a given displacement vector field @xmath10 , the matrix field @xmath5 is the linearised strain , which measures the pointwise deviation of the deformation @xmath43 from a rigid motion , up to the first order terms in @xmath44 .",
    "hence , korn s inequality can be interpreted as a rigidity estimate for small displacement deformations : they are @xmath40 close to @xmath45 , by the error given in the right hand side of ( [ intro_korn ] ) . a nonlinear version of this rigidity estimate , obtained recently in @xcite , has been extensively applied to problems in nonlinear elasticity and plate theories ( see eg @xcite ) .",
    "earlier , korn s inequalites in thin neighbourhoods of flat surfaces have been discussed in series of papers by kohn and vogelius @xcite .",
    "they derive an estimate which degenerates as @xmath39 for clamped boundary conditions at the side of the plate .",
    "an analogous result in our settting is given in theorem  [ th_very_weak ] below .",

    "consider a family @xmath47 of thin shells around @xmath3 : @xmath48 given by a family of smooth positive functions @xmath49 .",
    "we will use the following notation : @xmath50 for the outward unit normal to @xmath19 , @xmath51 for the outward unit normal to @xmath3 ( seen as the boundary of some bounded domain in @xmath4 ) , @xmath52 for the tangent space to @xmath3 at a given @xmath53 .",
    "the projection onto @xmath3 along @xmath54 will be denoted by @xmath55 , so that : @xmath56    the standard korn inequality ( see theorem [ korn_standard ] in appendix a ) on bounded lipschitz domains implies that for each @xmath57 satisfying the orthogonality condition : @xmath58 one has : @xmath59 and the constant @xmath8 depends only on the domain @xmath1 , but not on @xmath10 . here",

    "as shown in the example in section [ example ] , @xmath8 may indeed converge to infinity as the thickness of @xmath1 ( that is @xmath67 ) converges to @xmath68 .",
    "our goal is to investigate the behaviour of @xmath8 in two frameworks , relating to the following hypotheses :    * for some positive constants @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and all small @xmath71 there holds : @xmath72 * for some smooth positive functions @xmath73 , there holds : @xmath74    notice that clearly * ( h2 ) * implies * ( h1 ) * with , for example : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .    before stating our main results , we need to recall the notion of a killing vector field .",
    "the lie algebra of smooth killing vector fields on @xmath3 will be denoted by @xmath78 .",
    "that is , @xmath79 if and only if :    * @xmath80 is smooth and @xmath81 for every @xmath53 , * @xmath82 for every @xmath53 and every @xmath83 .    condition ( ii ) implies that @xmath84 recall that killing vector fields are infinitesimal generators of isometries on @xmath3 , in the sense that if @xmath85 is the flow generated by @xmath26 : @xmath86 then for every fixed @xmath87 the map @xmath88 is an isometry .",
    "it is known that the linear space @xmath78 has finite dimension @xcite .",
    "we recall this fact in appendix c.    given positive smooth functions @xmath73 , define : @xmath89    our main results are the following :    [ th1 ] assume * ( h1 ) * and let @xmath90 be any constant .",
    "then , for all @xmath71 sufficiently small and all @xmath57 satisfying one of the following tangency conditions : @xmath91 or : @xmath92 together with : @xmath93 there holds : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is independent of @xmath10 and of @xmath2 .",
    "[ th2 ] assume * ( h2 ) * and let @xmath90 be any constant .",
    "then for all @xmath71 sufficiently small and all @xmath57 satisfying @xmath96 on @xmath19 and : @xmath97 there holds ( [ korn ] ) with @xmath95 independent of @xmath10 and of @xmath2 .",
    "the example constructed in section [ example ] shows that conditions ( [ f1 ] ) ( or ( [ f2 ] ) ) are necessary for the bound ( [ korn ] ) . in particular , any killing field @xmath26 on @xmath3 can be extended to a vector field @xmath98 on @xmath1 , satisfying the boundary condition and such that @xmath99 but @xmath100 .",
    "hence , if one naively assumes that @xmath10 satisfies the angle condition only with the space of generators of appropriate rotations on @xmath3 , rather than the whole @xmath78 , the constant @xmath8 has a blow - up rate of at least @xmath101 , as @xmath9 .",
    "the following theorem shows that this is the actual blow - up rate , under the abovementioned conditions .",
    "more precisely , define : @xmath102 @xmath103    [ th_very_weak ] let @xmath90 be any constant .",
    "then , for all @xmath2 sufficiently small and all @xmath57 , there holds : @xmath104 in any of the following situations :    * * ( h1 ) * holds , @xmath105 on @xmath106 or @xmath105 on @xmath107 , and : @xmath108 * * ( h2 ) * holds , @xmath105 on @xmath19 , and : @xmath109    notice that ( i ) is implied by the hypotheses of theorem [ th1 ] and ( ii ) by the hypotheses of theorem [ th2 ] , as the spaces @xmath110 and @xmath111 are contained in @xmath78 or @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "the bound ( [ very_weak ] ) was obtained also in @xcite , but in a different context of thin plates with clamped boundary conditions and rapidly varying thickness .",
    "conditions ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f2 ] ) may be understood in the following way : the cosine of the angle ( in @xmath113 ) between @xmath10 and its projection onto the linear space @xmath114 of ` trivial ' extensions @xmath115 of certain killing fields @xmath116 ( or @xmath117 ) should be smaller than @xmath118 .",
    "equivalently , one considers vector fields @xmath119 , which for a given constant @xmath120 ( related to @xmath118 through : @xmath121 ) satisfy : @xmath122 that is , the distance of @xmath10 from the space @xmath123 controls ( uniformly ) the full norm @xmath124 .    by theorems [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] ,",
    "inside each closed cone around @xmath125 , of fixed angle @xmath126 in @xmath113 , the bound ( [ korn ] ) holds , with a constant @xmath95 , that is uniform in @xmath10 and @xmath2 .",
    "one could therefore argue that @xmath123 is the kernel for the uniform korn - poincar inequality , in the same manner as the linear maps @xmath127 with skew gradients @xmath128 constitute the kernel for the standard korn inequality ( [ ort_lin ] ) , ( [ korn_nonunif ] ) .",
    "this is not exactly the case , as the uniform korn inequality is true for the extensions @xmath115 ( see remark [ rem_trivial_ext ] ) .",
    "the role of the aforementioned kernel is played by the space @xmath129 of other , smart extensions @xmath98 of the killing fields @xmath26 ( see the formula ( [ 3_def ] ) ) .",
    "still , with @xmath115 replaced by @xmath98 in ( [ f1 ] ) or ( [ f2 ] ) , both theorems [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] remain true . indeed ,",
    "notice that the spaces @xmath123 and @xmath129 are asymptotically tangent at @xmath130 : @xmath131 hence , if @xmath132 for some @xmath90 , then @xmath133 , and the angle conditions in main theorems hold , with another @xmath90 , when @xmath2 is sufficiently small .",
    "thus , the fact that we chose to work with trivial extensions , in @xmath123 ( giving a simpler condition ) , instead of the real kernel @xmath129 , is not restrictive .    in the particular case",
    "when @xmath19 is parallel to @xmath3 , say @xmath134 , we have @xmath135 @xmath136 if @xmath137 then @xmath138 is tangent to @xmath3 and , as shown in appendix a ( theorem [ lemma_rotations ] ) it generates a rotation on @xmath3 .",
    "actually , one has : @xmath139 and so by the preceding comment we see that the condition ( [ ort_lin ] ) is asymptotically contained in ( [ f1 ] ) ( or ( [ f2 ] ) ) .",
    "a natural question is whether @xmath78 may contain other vector fields than the restrictions of generators of rigid motions on the whole @xmath4 .",
    "this is clearly the case when @xmath140 : any tangent vector field of constant length is a killing field .",
    "the same question for higher dimensions and even for @xmath141 and general ( nonconvex ) hypersurfaces is , to our knowledge , still open .",
    "it is closely related to another open problem of whether the class of rotationally symmetric surfaces is closed under intrinsic isometries .",
    "a further related question is whether every intrinsic isometry on @xmath3 is actually a restriction of some isometry of @xmath142 .",
    "when @xmath3 is convex , it is well known that it is the case , while for non - convex surfaces it is false .",
    "the answer to the same question , formulated for @xmath46-parameter families of isometries is not known ( see @xcite vol . 5 ) .    *",
    "an outline of proofs of theorems [ th1 ] and [ th2 ] . *",
    "the general strategy is as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath5 is small .",
    "the main idea is to study the map @xmath143 which is obtained by averaging @xmath10 in the normal direction : @xmath144 by the boundary condition , one has @xmath145 , i.e. @xmath146 is almost tangential to @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , @xmath147 is essentially bounded by the average of @xmath5 .",
    "hence if @xmath5 is small , by korn s inequality on surfaces , the field @xmath146 must be close to a killing field @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath26 is not small , we will get a contradiction to the angle condition ( [ f1 ] ) or ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath26 is small then we get good estimates for @xmath146 and ultimately for @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , the proof proceeds as follows .",
    "first ( see theorem  [ approx ] ) , an application of korn s inequality to cylinders of size @xmath2 and an interpolation argument yield a smooth field @xmath148 such that : @xmath149 from this we deduce ( see lemma [ lem2 ] ) : @xmath150 where @xmath151 for all tangent fields @xmath152 and @xmath153 .    using the boundary conditions it is easy to show that ( see lemma [ lem1 ] ) : @xmath154 it is thus natural to study the tangent field",
    ": @xmath155 now korn s inequality on @xmath3 implies that there exists a killing field @xmath26 such that : @xmath156 by the angle condition , @xmath26 must be small in @xmath157 , and hence in @xmath158 since the killing fields form a finite dimensional space .",
    "thus , @xmath159 is controlled , and by ( [ d ] ) @xmath160 is also controlled .",
    "now the crucial step is to combine ( [ b ] ) and ( [ c ] ) to deduce that : @xmath161 ( see lemma [ lem3 ] ) . from ( [ e ] ) and ( [ d ] ) we obtain control on @xmath162 . by ( [ c ] )",
    "this controls @xmath163 , hence @xmath164 , and finally ( [ a ] ) gives the estimate for @xmath6 .",
    "the actual argument is by contradiction , assuming that @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( see section [ section_endproof ] ) .",
    "above and in all subsequent proofs , @xmath95 denotes an arbitrary positive constant , depending on the geometry of @xmath3 and constants @xmath167 in * ( h1 ) * or the functions @xmath168 in * ( h2)*. the constant @xmath95 may also depend on the choice of @xmath118 , but it is always independent of @xmath10 and @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath73 be some positive and smooth functions , and let @xmath169 assume that on @xmath3 there exists a nonzero killing vector field @xmath26 such that : @xmath170 we are going to construct a family @xmath171 satisfying the boundary condition @xmath172 for which the uniform bound ( [ korn ] ) is not valid ( after we take @xmath173 ) .",

    "for all @xmath53 and all @xmath176 define : @xmath177 by ( [ ex_uno ] ) we easily obtain : @xmath178 which means that each @xmath98 is a linear interpolation between the push - forward of the vector field @xmath26 from @xmath3 onto the external part @xmath106 of the boundary of @xmath1 and the other push - forward onto the internal part @xmath107 of @xmath19 ( see figure [ ex_fig ] ) . indeed ,",
