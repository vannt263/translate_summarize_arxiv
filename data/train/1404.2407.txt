    "in 1943 , luria and delbrck  @xcite ( ld hereafter ) used a simple evolutionary model together with laboratory experiments to argue that bacterial resistance ( to bacteriophage , in their specific case ) arose via the selection of pre - existing mutations .",
    "their model postulated a constant probability at which dividing normal cells would have a resistant daughter ; these mutations were assumed to not affect the growth rate until the bacteria were challenged . the ld model and various extensions thereof have been used extensively in recent years to study the emergence of antibiotic - resistant microbes  @xcite as well as chemotherapy - resistant cancer cells  @xcite",
    ". similar models are used to study the generation of differentiated cells from stem - like precursors  @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable effort in the mathematics and statistical physics communities devoted to understanding the probability distribution that arises from the ld process  @xcite . while early efforts focused on various quasi - deterministic versions of the model where both wild - type and mutant cells or alternatively just the wild - type are assumed to undergo continuous exponential growth , more recently interest has focussed on the fully stochastic model .",
    "a major achievement has very recently been achieved by antal and krapivsky  @xcite who solve for the generating function of the full joint distribution of the number of wild - types and mutants as a function of time , starting from a single wild - type individual .",
    "also noteworthy is the solution by angerer  @xcite for the probability distribution of the number of mutants given a fixed total population , @xmath0 , in the case of the symmetric birth - only version of the stochastic model , where both wild - type and mutant have identical birth rates and cell death is excluded .",
    "however , it has proven difficult to obtain much physical insight from these solutions , and to relate these solutions to those of the simpler quasi - deterministic models . in particular , the remarkable fact that the distribution is these simpler models",
    "becomes  @xcite a universal @xmath2-stable ( lvy ) distribution in the limit of small mutation rate @xmath3 , and large @xmath0 such that @xmath4 has had no known analogue in the fully stochastic models .    here",
    ", we introduce a new strategy to solve this model , taking advantage of the fact that for most cases of interest the population size @xmath0 is very large and the mutation rate @xmath3 is very small .",
    "for example , a tumor may have upwards of @xmath5 cells when it is first detected and the mutation rate , even if elevated above normal human mutation rates by genomic instability , would still be @xmath6 or smaller ( depending on exactly what range of mutations are assumed to be able to confer resistance ) .",
    "note that @xmath7 is in general large , and hence a perturbative treatment would not be accurate .",
    "we show that if one focuses attention on the fixed @xmath0 ensemble , one can derive an alternative generating function equation which leads immediately to a simple integral expression for the probability distribution .",
    "one can recover the asymptotic properties of this distribution for the general case where the resistant population may have a different fitness than the wild - type .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . to illustrate our methodology and to lay out the general features of the ld process , in particular that it gives rise to a distribution @xmath8 for the number @xmath9 of mutants",
    "which is heavy - tailed , we first present the special case of zero death rate .",
    "we show the general features of the quasi - deterministic model , including the fact that at large @xmath7 one obtains a universal @xmath2-stable distribution is actually valid for the fully stochastic version as well .",
    "next , we consider cell death in addition to division and mutation , and show that even for this case we recover for large @xmath7 the limiting landau distribution ( for equal birth rates ) and its generalization for the asymmetric case .",
    "finally , we compare our results to those of antal and krapivsky , who formally solve the same problem with a fixed time ensemble .",
    "some of our results have appeared previously in abbreviated form  @xcite .",
    "to illustrate our basic ideas , we start with the relatively simple case of no cell death ( i.e. a pure birth / mutation process ) and with equal birth rates for both the wild - type and mutant subpopulations . if we start from a fixed number @xmath10 of initial wild - type cells and wish to study the ensemble at fixed total population @xmath0 , the number of events is just @xmath11 . rather than computing the probability function at fixed time , we instead use the event number as the independent variable .",
    "then , @xmath12 is just the probability that in the @xmath11 births since the beginning , there were no mutations , thus @xmath13 the master equation for @xmath14 , @xmath15 reads @xmath16   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to derive what we will refer to as the scaling solution for the probability distribution , we will keep the leading order in @xmath0 term for each order in @xmath3 . later , we will see exactly when this is valid .",
    "it is easy to check that this involves keeping the coefficient of @xmath17 for terms proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "let us denote this coefficient in @xmath19 as @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 . substituting this term into the master equation",
    ", we can check that the leading order in @xmath0 condition ( the @xmath22 term is automatically satisfied , but matching the next order in @xmath0 term ( proportional to @xmath23 ) leads to the non - trivial condition for @xmath24 : @xmath25 with @xmath26 the former condition comes from our exact solution of @xmath12 , eq .",
    "( [ pn0 ] ) , above and the latter from the fact that @xmath27 for all @xmath15 vanishes if @xmath28 . to solve this equation , we define the generating function @xmath29 in terms of which the generating function , @xmath30 , of the probability distribution is given by @xmath31 from the recursion relation eq .",

    "the method of characteristics tells us to write @xmath35 , choosing @xmath36 , so that the characteristic is @xmath37 where @xmath2 labels the characteristic",
    ". then the equation reads @xmath38 with the solution @xmath39 so that @xmath40 and thus @xmath41    this result was derived initially by lea and coulson @xcite , for a model which neglected the stochastic nature of the birth - death dynamics for the wild - type population . in our derivation , going to the scaling limit of @xmath0 large , @xmath42 , has resulted in a distribution which has no @xmath10 dependence .",
    "since when @xmath10 is large , the wild - type stochasticity is negligible , the fully stochastic treatment has to reduce to the lea - coulson result in the scaling limit .",
    "one can numerically evaluate the lea - coulson distribution from the generating function via a contour integration to pick out @xmath27 : @xmath43 this is more conveniently computed by moving the contour to hug the branch cut along the real axis @xmath44 : @xmath45 a computation of this for the case @xmath46 is shown in fig .",

    "this @xmath59 behavior at large @xmath9 is in fact true for all @xmath7 , and is a direct result of the logarithmic singularity of @xmath30 at @xmath60 .",
    "the large @xmath7 limit is also tractable , for @xmath9 s of order @xmath7 .",
    "we write @xmath61 , and write @xmath62 , giving @xmath63 this is just a landau distribution , the one - sided @xmath2-stable ( lvy ) distribution with index @xmath64 , written in terms of the original variables as @xmath65 times the normalization factor @xmath66 .",
    "the landau distribution rises very rapidly from zero , reaches it maximum and then falls with a @xmath59 fat tail .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath2-stable distribution in the quasi - deterministic model  @xcite is a consequence of the fact that the total number of mutants is the sum of the mutants descended from each mutation event , and from large @xmath0 these are independent and identically distributed with a power - law tail , and thus the conditions of the generalized central - limit theorem are satisfied .",
    "the landau distribution arises in the fully stochastic model for the same reasons ; the only difference being an overall shift in the distribution .",
    "thus , the lea - coulson distribution is seen to interpolate between the monotonic @xmath67 distribution at small @xmath7 to the fat - tailed one - sided @xmath2-stable distribution with its sharp rise for small @xmath9 and @xmath59 falloff at large @xmath9 .",
    "a signpost value is @xmath46 , above which @xmath27 is no longer monotonic .",

    "in addition , the small @xmath7 limiting form @xmath72 and the large @xmath7 landau distribution are also shown .",
    "it is seen that the landau distribution correctly describes the distribution except for @xmath9 s of order unity.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    for @xmath9 of order @xmath0 , the lea - coulson result breaks down because we have neglected terms that become of comparable order in this new regime .",
    "this outer regime  @xcite describes how the distribution must drop to zero as we approach @xmath73 ; after all , the most extreme possibility is that every division resulted in adding one more mutant .",
    "since @xmath3 is small , this part of the distribution arises when one of the first births lead to a mutant and hence the mutant sub - population has as much chance to expand exponentially as does the wild - type . to describe this scenario ,",
    "one need only keep terms linear in @xmath3 .",
    "this can be done explicitly in the symmetric birth - only model  @xcite . however , even this problem is difficult to solve exactly in the general case , and is only of mathematical interest , since this outer part of the distribution describes extremely rare events and have essentially no physical relevance .",
    "we now extend the previous results to account for a fitness ( aka birth rate ) difference between the wild - type and the resistant subpopulations .",
    "normally it would be exacted that alleles conferring resistance are less fit in the absence of any drug , and hence we expect the division rate ratio @xmath74 of wild - type to resistant cell to be greater than one .",
    "the master equation connecting the mutant number distribution at one overall population size to the next overall population size , must take into account the relative probability that it is a wild - type cell that divides versus that it is a mutant cell which divides .",
    "if the current population has @xmath9 mutant cells and hence @xmath75 wild - type ones , this relative probability is @xmath76 .",

    ", in the ak fixed time ensemble , for times corresponding to @xmath212 , 1 and @xmath71.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    looking at @xmath213 for small @xmath205 , we see that it does reproduce the small @xmath7 limit of the lea - coulson answer . more generally , the structure of the singularity at @xmath60 is the same of for lea - coulson , so that fixed - time ensemble does show the same @xmath59 behavior as our fixed-@xmath0 ensemble for the intermediate asymptotic regime @xmath214 .",
    "the behavior in the cut - off regime @xmath215 is not surprisingly very different from the fixed-@xmath0 behavior , since the shift of the pole of @xmath213 to @xmath216 means that the decay of @xmath8 is exponential for @xmath215    of course , the full ak solution contains information about the wild - type distribution encoded in its dependence on @xmath217 which has been dropped in the derivation of @xmath218 . if we return to the full solution for @xmath193 , we can of course restrict ourself to a fixed value of @xmath219 by finding the coefficient of the term that goes like @xmath220 .",
    "this is still not exactly the same problem we solved .",
    "our initial ensemble allows the elapsed time to vary , whereas this new result fixes both the time and the total population .",
    "however , the distribution of mutants as we have seen is controlled by the total population , and we do not expect the time taken to reach this population to matter significantly , at least as long as it is close to the average time . further , as we have already noted , for @xmath42 , the total population @xmath0 and the wild - type population @xmath171 are the same to leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "thus , undaunted , we continue .",
    "the projection of @xmath180 onto fixed @xmath219 , which we denote @xmath221 can be done exactly , since the @xmath217 dependence of @xmath193 is simple and takes the form @xmath222 with @xmath223^\\mu}{1-x } , \\qquad   a_3=-\\frac{x[(1-z)(1-x)]^\\mu}{1-x},\\ ] ] and where as before @xmath224 .",
    "thus , @xmath225 where @xmath129 is a normalization factor , chosen so that @xmath226 .",
    "the non - trivial normalization factor arises because we do not know a priori the overall probability of finding exactly the correct value of @xmath0 in the overall ensemble , and hence this must be divided out to obtain a meaningful probability distribution .",
    "now , in the limit @xmath227 , @xmath228 thus , we can find the value of the normalization constant @xmath229 given this , we can now calculate the leading large-@xmath202 behavior of @xmath230 , which we wish to compare to @xmath213 . for fixed @xmath54 and large @xmath202 , @xmath231 and @xmath232^{1-\\mu}}{x } - \\frac{1}{x } \\approx-1 + \\frac{1}{{{{\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mun\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu } } } } - \\mu\\frac{(1-x)\\ln(1-x)}{x } .\\ ] ] also , @xmath233^\\mu }   \\approx \\frac{1}{n } .\\ ] ] .",
    "finally we obtain @xmath234 this is just the lea - coulson result that we had obtained above .",
    "thus , our expectations that post - projecting the fixed - time ensemble for fixed wild - type abundance would reproduce the fixed population ensemble result in the intermediate asymptotic regime are indeed realized .",
    "the above calculation was for @xmath152 . for general @xmath10 , the ak result for the generating function",
    "@xmath235 is immediate : @xmath236^{n_0 } , \\ ] ] due to the independence of the life histories of the initial @xmath10 wild - type .",
    "clearly then , the ak result , i.e. conditioning on fixed time , is @xmath10 dependent , as opposed to the @xmath10 independence of the fixed total population result , for @xmath92 .",
    "we can generalize our calculation of the fixed @xmath219 projection of the ak result to general @xmath237 .",
    "now , we have @xmath238 . then , performing the taylor expansion of @xmath239 we get @xmath240 the normalization factor is now @xmath241^{n_0-{{{\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mun\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}}}}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx { { { \\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mun\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}}}\\left(\\frac{e}{n_0}\\right)^{n_0}(n_0 - 1 ) ! .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "then , @xmath242 recovering , as we expect , the @xmath10-independent lea - coulson result .",
    "it is remarkable that the fixed population ensemble results are much more similar to the original semi - deterministic model of luria and delbrck , with its universal aspects such as @xmath10 independence and large @xmath7 @xmath2-stable distribution than is the fixed time ensemble .",
    "we chose to first present our projection method in the simplest possible context of the pure - birth , symmetric model , as in this case the ak solution is expressible in terms of elementary functions and the structure of the calculation is most transparent . the procedure , however , works in essentially the same way for the most general asymmetric birth - death model for which ak presented their solution for the fixed time ensemble . the model is now parameterized in terms of wild - type and mutant birth rates , @xmath108 , @xmath109 as well as wild - type and mutant death rates , @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "ak choose to scale time so that the non - mutating wild - type birth process @xmath243 has rate unity .",
    "ak then introduce the following rates : @xmath244 ak also introduce the auxiliary parameter @xmath245 note that in the small @xmath3 limit , @xmath246 is of order @xmath3 : @xmath247 ak define as well @xmath248 where the approximations are correct to leading order in @xmath3 .",
    "then , the full solution derived in ak takes the extremely complicated form @xmath249 where @xmath250 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad{}- z_0^c z(c-1)f_2(z)\\left[f_1(z_0)(1+\\omega ) + \\lambda_m f_3(z_0)z_0\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & \\   { } \\qquad + z_0^c z^2 f_4(z ) \\left [ f_1(z_0)(1+\\omega ) + \\lambda_m z_0 f_3(z_0)\\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ t_3 & = z^c z_0 f_1(z ) f_2(z_0 ) - z_0^c z f_2(z ) f_1(z_0 ) , \\nonumber\\\\ t_4 & = z^c z_0 f_1(z ) \\left[f_2(z_0)((c-1)\\lambda_m - 1 - \\omega ) - z_0 \\lambda_m f_4(z_0)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\qquad { } + z z_0^c f_2(z ) \\left[f_1(z_0)(1+\\omega ) + \\lambda_m z_0 f_3(z_0)\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the function definitions @xmath251 and @xmath252 , \\qquad z_0 = { { \\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mum\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}}z .\\ ] ] here , @xmath253 and is related to @xmath202 , the average number of wild - type cells , by @xmath254 then , @xmath230 is given by @xmath255    for the calculation of the @xmath256 factor , it is sufficient to work to zeroth order in @xmath3 . to this order @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "then , we have @xmath259\\left [ z^c z_0 ( b\\lambda_m - 1 ) + z z_0^c\\right ] - \\left[-bz_0^c z \\right]\\left[z^cz_0-z_0^c z\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = b^2\\lambda_m z_0^{c+1 } z^{c+1 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath260 term in the denominator , things are even simpler since we can use the fact that @xmath261 : @xmath262 so that @xmath263    for the calculation of @xmath264 we have to keep both the first @xmath1 and @xmath3 corrections since the ratio is to be raised to the @xmath202th power .",

    "it is amazing how our relatively simple scaling distribution is encoded in the immensely more complicated ak formalism .",
    "being exact , their equation must contain all the details regarding the outer region ( when @xmath9 is the same order as @xmath0 ) , must allow for arbitrary values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 , and must reflect the intricate interplay of time and population size .",
    "our approach is much less general , but has the distinct advantage of leading to answers that are simple enough for us to gain some insight into what is going on . in the last part of this section",
    ", we will see that we can employ a trick to recover our results from the ak formalism in a much simpler fashion .",
    "there is an alternate way to extract our desired fixed population distribution from the ak results .",
    "we have seen that in the regime of interest , @xmath92 , the distribution is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "if we take @xmath10 large however , the wild - type dynamics becomes deterministic and so the fixed time and fixed population ensembles become identical .",
    "thus , all we need to do is to take the ak results for large @xmath10 , and this gives the desired generating function directly .",
    "we now proceed to carry this out for the general non - symmetric case .    following the notation in ak ,",
    "we focus on @xmath275 with the definition @xmath276 where the @xmath277 are the same as given above , with the constants taking the values ( valid to leading order in @xmath3 ) : @xmath278 and where the constant @xmath195 is determined by the normalization condition @xmath279 : @xmath280 with @xmath281 the value of @xmath282 at @xmath115 .",
    "note that in general @xmath282 is proportional to @xmath283 .",
    "finally @xmath284 .",
    "this seems to be an completely unwieldy mess .",
    "but , we get an enormous simplification if we recall that we are interested in small @xmath3 and therefore can use the leading order results @xmath285 , @xmath286 , and @xmath287 is @xmath288 and hence can be dropped in the denominator , since @xmath195 is also @xmath288 . with the definition @xmath289",
    ", we can derive the much simpler leading order expression @xmath290    finally , we use the fact that @xmath282 is small as it is related @xmath291 which equals @xmath292 raised to the positive power @xmath293 .",
    "thus , @xmath294 is given by @xmath295 we need an explicit expression for @xmath296 .",
    "we have @xmath297 thus , we have the final expression @xmath298 again reproducing what we have previously calculated .",
    "we have analyzed here the pure birth as well as the birth - death stochastic luria - delbrck model in the limit of small mutation rate @xmath3 and large current population , @xmath0 , where the product @xmath7 is unrestricted .",
    "the answer in all cases exhibits an intermediate asymptotic power - law decay @xmath95 for @xmath214 , where @xmath74 is the ratio of the wild - type net growth rate to the mutant net growth rate . for small @xmath7 ,",
    "the distribution is monotonically decreasing , and approaches the pure power - law already for @xmath9 s of order unity .",
    "as @xmath7 increases the probability of a small number of mutants decreases sharply , and above a critical @xmath7 of order 1 , the distribution develops a peak . the power - law decay sets in then only a distance past this peak . for large @xmath7 ,",
    "the distribution becomes the one - sided lvy distribution with index @xmath74 .",
    "the distribution for @xmath92 is in all cases independent of the initial wide type colony size @xmath10 .",
    "it is also independent of the precise nature of the ensemble , as long as there are sufficient numbers of wild - type individuals in all members of the ensemble with non - vanishingly small weighting .",
    "this can be guaranteed by fixing @xmath299 at either fixed time or in a time average , or alternatively by having a large number for the number @xmath10 of initial wild - type individuals .",
    "the power - law tail , as well as the strong dependence of the distribution on @xmath10 for @xmath215 has significant implications for tasks such as using measured data to infer mutation rate @xcite .",
    "this also has implications for the variation expected in patient responses to administered therapy , although it seems that the _ extrinsic _ variation due to different rates dominates over the _ intrinsic _ variation due to process stochasticity  @xcite .",
