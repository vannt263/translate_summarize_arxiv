    "two - dimensional condensed matter systems often present remarkable transport properties .",
    "a famous example is the _ integer quantum hall effect _ ( iqhe ) : the hall conductivity of thin samples at very low temperatures , exposed to strong transverse magnetic fields , is equal to an integer times the von klitzing constant @xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "this measurement is amazingly sharp : the observation of the hall plateaux is by now used to measure the fine structure constant , at a very high level of accuracy . in view of the complexity of the underlying microscopic hamiltonian , which depends on several material- and sample - dependent parameters ,",
    "the universality of the hall conductivity is a very remarkable phenomenon .",
    "the quantization of the hall conductivity for non - interacting fermions has a beautiful topological interpretation @xcite , and the intrinsic robustness of a topological quantity offers a natural qualitative explanation of the observed universality .",
    "the universality of the hall conductivity in the presence of disorder has later been established in full mathematical rigor in @xcite .",
    "a similar universality property is expected to be valid in the presence of many - body interactions , as well .",
    "however , while , in the non - interacting disordered case , the features of the many - body problem can be deduced from the spectral properties of a single - particle schrdinger operator , in the study of the interacting case one needs to consider the full @xmath1-particle schrdinger equation , whose properties are still incompletely understood , both in the presence and in the absence of disorder .",
    "this explains why a mathematical proof of the quantization of the hall conductance for _ interacting _ electrons remained open @xcite for many years .",
    "effective field theories @xcite have been used for explaining a possible `` topological '' mechanisms underlying both the integral and the fractional qhe in interacting electron systems .",
    "however , they are based on certain phenomenological assumptions , such as the _ incompressibility _ of the `` quantum hall fluid '' , which may be very hard to check from first principles in concrete models .",
    "more recently , the quantization of the hall conductivity has been rigorously proved @xcite by using the notion of quasi - adiabatic evolution of the ground state , under changes of the magnetic fluxes acting on the system . however , the proof of @xcite is based on the hypothesis that the interacting ground state is non - degenerate and , as in the effective field theory approach , incompressible , which amounts to say that the interacting ground state is gapped , uniformly in the system size .",
    "this assumption is unproven in most physically relevant cases , at least in the context of interacting fermions .",
    "as far as we know , the only cases for which it is proved are perturbations of `` topologically trivial '' classical reference states @xcite , or of `` frustration free '' hamiltonians @xcite , that is of hamiltonians that can be written as sums of projectors geometrically localized around the sites of the underlying lattice .    in this work , by using a different approach , we prove the quantization of the hall conductivity for general interacting fermionic systems , under the assumptions that the reference non - interacting system is gapped , and that the interaction is weak and short - ranged . in particular , our result applies to the interacting versions of the hofstadter @xcite and haldane @xcite models .",
    "this provides a theoretical justification of the numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite observations of the quantization of the hall conductivity in the interacting haldane model",
    ". our proof does not require any a priori assumption on the interacting spectrum of the system .",
    "it is based on constructive renormalization group techniques combined with lattice ward identities .",
    "we write a _ convergent _ power series expansion for the conductivity , defined in terms of the green - kubo formula , in the limit as the imaginary frequency tends to zero , and we show that all the interaction - dependent corrections vanish exactly , in the infinite volume and zero temperature limits .",
    "the idea that the universality of hall conductance follows from ward identities is well known @xcite , but their implementation was so far limited to continuum effective quantum field theory models plagued by ultraviolet divergences , and their use was combined with formal manipulations of non - convergent feynman graph expansions . in our approach",
    "we consider lattice hamiltonian models , in which the lattice continuity equation implies exact ward identities , and we apply in this context the same ideas as @xcite . the convergence of the perturbative expansion is achieved by re - summing the usual feynman diagram expansions in the form of a determinant expansion , amenable to being treated by constructive renormalization group methods .",
    "these methods were used earlier for constructing the ground state of several low - dimensional interacting fermi systems , and for proving universality relations among critical exponents , amplitudes and conductivities @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply these ideas for the first time to the study of the transverse ( hall ) conductivity .",
    "an informal statement of our main result is the following .",
    "_ consider a fermionic system on a two - dimensional periodic lattice , with grand canonical hamiltonian @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a quadratic gapped hamiltonian , @xmath4 is a density - density interaction , decaying faster than any power at large distances , and @xmath5 is its strength . if @xmath5 is small enough , then the interacting correlation functions are analytic in @xmath5 and decay faster than any power at large distances , uniformly in the system size and in the temperature .",
    "the conductivity matrix , defined by the green - kubo formula , in the limit as the imaginary frequency tends to zero , is analytic as well , and its infinite volume and zero temperature limit is independent of @xmath5 . in particular , the longitudinal conductivity is zero , while the transverse one is quantized . _    the rest of the paper is devoted to the proof of this result . in section [ sec : modelgen ] we define the general class of hamiltonians we consider , we define the current observable and the conductivity , and state our main theorem in a mathematically precise way . in section [ sec : proofuniv ]",
    "we prove the main result , under the assumption of analyticity and smoothness of the multipoint current correlations , by making use of ward identites , which are nothing but the restatement of the continuity equation for the density at the level of correlation functions . in section [ app : analyt ] we prove the analyticity and smoothness of the correlations , by using multiscale fermionic cluster expansion techniques . strictly speaking ,",
    "the content of section [ app : analyt ] is a straightforward adaptation of previous results , but we include it here for the sake of self - containedness . in the appendices we collect some auxiliary results : in appendix [ app : kubo ] we reproduce the well known result that the non - interacting kubo conductivity is equal to the chern number of the filled bloch bands ; in appendix [ sec : haldane ] we apply our main result to the interacting haldane model , and show that it displays a non - trivial topological phase diagram .",
    "in this section , we give a mathematically precise formulation of the class of models we consider .",
    "first , we introduce the periodic lattice and the fermionic operators associated with its sites .",
    "next , we define the grand - canonical hamiltonian and state our main assumptions on its quadratic and interaction parts , including the gap condition on the fermi level .",
    "we proceed by defining the finite volume thermal correlation functions and their cumulants .",
