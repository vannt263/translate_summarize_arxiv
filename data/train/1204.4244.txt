    "the primary goal of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is to search for and characterize the new state of matter with partonic degrees of freedom , namely the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , predicted by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite . in high - energy collisions at rhic , heavy quarks ( @xmath6 , @xmath12 ) are expected to be created from initial hard scatterings  @xcite and the relative changes in their masses are small by the strong interactions with the qcd medium  @xcite .",
    "thus they carry clean information from the system at the early stage . the interaction between heavy quarks and",
    "the medium is sensitive to the medium dynamics , therefore heavy quarks are suggested as an `` ideal '' probe to quantify the properties of the strongly interacting qcd matter  @xcite .",
    "consequently , measurements of heavy - quark production over a wide transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) region in proton - proton ( @xmath13 + @xmath13 ) collisions are critical to provide a baseline for understanding the results from heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in particular , precise knowledge of the total charm production cross sections from to central heavy - ion collisions is critical to understand both open charm and charmonium production mechanisms in the qgp medium formed in central heavy - ion collisions at rhic  @xcite .    in elementary particle collisions , processes involving heavy quarks with masses much larger than the qcd scale ( @xmath14 )",
    "are , in principle , amenable to perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations . for heavy - quark production cross sections at large momentum transfer @xmath15 , fixed - order next - to - leading logarithm ( fonll ) pqcd calculations , where @xmath16 , are expected to work reasonably well  @xcite .",
    "however , calculations of the charm cross section at low @xmath4 become complicated because charm quarks can not be treated as a massless flavor . furthermore , in the low momentum transfer region there is a large uncertainty in the gluon density function , and the strong coupling constant increases dramatically . thus , perturbative qcd calculations have little predictive power for the total charm cross section in high - energy hadron - hadron collisions  @xcite . in view of these theoretical issues ,",
    "experimental measurements become necessary and in turn provide constraints that improve theoretical calculations .",
    "measurements of inclusive charm production have been carried out through two main approaches : _ i _ ) single leptons from heavy flavor semi - leptonic decays , and _ ii _ ) charmed hadrons from hadronic decays .",
    "the advantages of the first method include an experimentally triggerable observable and relatively large decay branching ratios , thus resulting in relatively large statistics .",
    "however , interpretations of the experimental results contain ambiguities because _ a _ ) leptons are produced by various charmed and bottomed hadron decays , and _ b _ ) heavy - flavor hadrons contributing to leptons at a certain @xmath4 can come from a wide kinematic region due to the decay smearing .",
    "the second method suffers from a large combinatorial background when all particles from the collision vertex are included , without any reconstruction of the secondary weak - decay vertices .",
    "this background is particularly large ( s / b is in the order of @xmath17 ) in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "there are many measurements of the charm production cross section in low energy or @xmath13 + a collisions via both semi - leptonic and hadronic decays at cern and fermilab  @xcite .",
    "results for the total charm cross sections ( from measurements with reasonable extrapolations ) are consistent with next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd calculations . at high energies , the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) collaboration at the tevatron measured the charmed - hadron cross sections at @xmath18 5 gev/@xmath6 in @xmath13 + @xmath19 collisions at @xmath20 = 1.96 tev , and results for @xmath0 , @xmath21 and @xmath7 mesons are consistent with the upper bounds of fonll pqcd calculations  @xcite . at rhic energies ,",

    "the result from collisions is also consistent with the upper bound of fonll pqcd calculations at @xmath22 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "measurements of the @xmath0 cross section by the reconstruction of hadronic decays were carried out in @xmath23 + au collisions  @xcite , but no measurement of the charmed - hadron production cross section in collisions has been made at rhic until now .    in this paper , we report measurements from the star experiment of the charmed - hadron ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) production cross section at mid - rapidity in collisions at @xmath20 = 200gev .",
    "charmed hadrons , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , were reconstructed via hadronic decays in the transverse momentum ranges of 0.6@xmath52.0 gev/@xmath6 and 2@xmath56 gev/@xmath6 , respectively .",

    "the tpc is the main tracking detector , covering the full azimuthal angle at pseudo - rapidity @xmath24 1 for tracks crossing all 45 padrows  @xcite .",
    "it measures the charged - particle momenta and provides particle - identification ( pid ) capability via the ionization energy loss ( @xmath25 ) in the tpc gas , allowing a clean separation between charged kaons and pions up to momentum @xmath260.6 gev/@xmath6 .",

    "the tof detector uses the timing recorded in the forward vpd detector as the start time to calculate the particle time of flight , which is combined with the momentum from the tpc to identify particles .",
    "the timing resolution of the tof system , including the start timing resolution in @xmath20 = 200gev collisions , is about 110 ps , allowing separation of @xmath27 and @xmath28 up to @xmath261.5 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "the barrel and endcap emcs are designed to identify electrons and photons , covering the full azimuthal angle at @xmath24 1 and 1 @xmath29 2 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "they are fast - response detectors ( @xmath30 ns ) , and were used to suppress the tpc pileup - track contribution in the event - vertex finder by matching with charged tracks from the tpc .",
    "in addition to providing the start time for the barrel tof detector , the vpd detector is also one of the trigger detectors in star .",
    "it has two parts surrounding the beam pipe , located on the east and west sides , 5.7 m away from the center of the star detector and covering 4.24 @xmath31 5.1  @xcite .",
    "the minimum - bias ( mb ) trigger was defined as a coincidence signal in the east and west vpd detectors and a selection was made on the vertex position along the beam axis ( @xmath32 ) to be within 40 cm of the center of the star detector .",
    "the bbc  @xcite consists of two identical counters located on each side of the tpc covering full azimuth and 2.1 @xmath31 5.0 in pseudo - rapidity .",
    "each part consists of a set of hexagonal scintillator tiles grouped into a ring and mounted around the beam pipe at a distance of 3.7 m from the center of star .",
    "the bbc detector had been used to define the main minimum - bias trigger in collisions before the minimum - bias trigger was used in 2009 .",
    "a small sample of bbc minimum - bias - triggered events were collected in 2009 to check for a trigger bias .",

    "the intrinsic drift time for electrons from the center to one end of the tpc is on the order of 40 @xmath34 .",
    "thus , in high - luminosity collisions , one tpc event usually contains tracks from collisions originating from non - triggered bunch crossings .",
    "these `` pileup events '' will lead to additional tracks recorded in the tpc , in addition to those from the triggered event .",
    "this effect was not significant in previous rhic runs , but the increase in the collision rate during 2009 to several hundred khz made this a significant effect . the @xmath32 position from offline vpd data",
    "has a resolution of 2.5 cm for minimum - bias events , which can provide a useful constraint to select the real event that fired the trigger .",

    "the mixed - events technique is not suitable for describing the background due to large contribution of correlated jets .",
    "therefore , two different techniques were used to reproduce the background : the like - sign and track - rotation methods . since the @xmath60 and @xmath61 production is symmetric in the star uniform acceptance and their yield ratio is measured to be 0.988 @xmath9 0.043  @xcite , the like - sign ( ls ) method is used and a pair combination with the same charged sign is expected to reproduce the background without the signal correlation .",
