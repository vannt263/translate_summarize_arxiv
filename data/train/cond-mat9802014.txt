    "pb and sn @xmath4-adlayer structures on the ( 111 ) surface of ge have recently revealed a charge density wave ( cdw ) instability to a low temperature reconstructed @xmath3 phase.@xcite the low temperature phase is either metallic  as seems to be the case for sn / ge(111 )  or weakly gapped , or pseudo - gapped , as suggested for pb / ge(111 ) . related systems , like the @xmath4-adlayer of si on the ( 0001 ) surface of sic @xcite and on k / si(111):b,@xcite show , instead , a clear insulating behavior  with a large gap  with no structural anomalies or cdws investigated so far .",
    "two - dimensional fermi surface ( fs ) nesting in the half - filled surface states@xcite has been invoked as the driving mechanism for the cdw instability in the case of pb / ge,@xcite but excluded for the case of sn / ge.@xcite    as all these systems appear to belong together in the same class , we should begin with a discussion that in principle encompasses all of them .",
    "we believe the following points to be of general validity : _",
    "i ) _ * poor nesting*. an unbiased interpretation of the photoemission experiments,@xcite and a close examination of the existing local density approximation ( lda ) calculations@xcite of the surface ( `` adatom dangling bond '' ) half - filled band do not indicate good nesting of the fs at the surface brillouin zone ( bz ) corner @xmath5 .",
    "we believe this to be equally true for pb / ge as for sn / ge , contrary to what stated in the literature.@xcite fig .  1 , showing the lda surface band dispersion for the test - case of si(111)/si,@xcite as well as the corresponding fs and lindhard density response function , provides a concrete illustration of these statements . _",
    "ii ) _ * importance of electron - electron interactions*. the width @xmath6 of the surface band is relatively small ( @xmath7 ev for pb - sn / ge , @xmath8 ev for sic ) . moreover , this band is half - filled .",
    "these facts call for a careful consideration of electron - electron interactions , and not just electron - phonon ( e - ph ) , as a possible source of instability .",
    "this is reinforced by noting the different phenomenology of sic and k / si : b with respect to pb - sn / ge , the stronger insulating character of the former paralleling closely their stronger electron - electron repulsions , connected with larger bulk semiconducting gaps . _",
    "iii ) _ * weakness of lda*. lda is certainly suitable for calculating realistic bands in a weakly interacting system , but is less reliable , at least without including spin , in predicting the instabilities of a narrow band .",
    "for instance , the phenomenology of sic(0001 )  suggesting a mott - hubbard insulator  is unreproducible by lda .",
    "the very onset of a cdw on sn / ge(111 ) does not seem to be predicted by recent lda calculations.@xcite _ iv ) _ * different mechanisms for @xmath3 cdw instabilities*. there are at least two different mechanisms which can influence the cdw formation : a ) on - site , and nearest - neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "electron - electron repulsion b ) on - site effective attraction ( negative hubbard-@xmath1 term ) of e - ph origin . of these ,",
    "the n.n . repulsion naturally suggests , as we shall see , the @xmath3 surface periodicity , which is found experimentally .",
    "electron - phonon alone would not in itself appear to drive a @xmath3 cdw . at weak coupling ,",
    "the band structure dominates and incommensurate structures could be preferred . at strong coupling ,",
    "the frustration associated to the triangular lattice , will favor , in general , a superconducting ground state over a cdw phase.@xcite .",
    "the approach we take here is based on an extended hubbard - holstein model .",
    "it is by necessity a `` non - first - principle '' approach and , as such , it has no strong predictive power .",
    "we have found it very helpful , however , in clarifying the possible scenarios as a function of physical parameters .",
    "the basic starting point is the half - filled surface state band @xmath9 which one calculates in lda , and is found to lie in the bulk gap.@xcite we write our effective hamiltonian as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the bloch surface state , whose wannier function is centered on the adatom , as can be seen in ref .",
    "@xmath12 includes correlation effects which are not correctly accounted for within lda , which we parametrize as follows : @xmath13 here @xmath1 is an effective repulsion ( hubbard-@xmath1 ) for two electrons on the same adatom wannier orbital , and @xmath14 is the direct coulomb interaction between different sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we have considered two models for @xmath14 : 1 ) a truncation to a n.n .",
    "@xmath2 , and 2 ) a model with a coulomb tail @xmath17 .",
    "the results for case 2 ) are qualitatively similar to those of 1 ) , and will be discussed elsewhere.@xcite lda estimates of the bare repulsions @xmath18 and @xmath19 between two electrons on the same and on neighboring wannier orbitals are  for our test case of si(111)/si  of about @xmath20 ev and @xmath21 ev respectively.@xcite screening effects by the the underlying bulk are expected to reduce very substantially these repulsive energies . a conservative lower bound for @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "is obtained dividing their bare values by the image - charge screening factor , @xmath22 , yielding @xmath23 ev , and @xmath24 ev . as for the e - ph interaction , in principle both the on - site wannier state energy and the hopping matrix elements between first neighbors depend on the positions of the adatoms . within the deformation potential approximation",

    "the system is deep inside the mott insulating regime.@xcite within the large manifold of spin degenerate states with exactly one electron per site , the kinetic energy generates , in second order perturbation theory , the heisenberg spin-1/2 antiferromagnet as the effective hamiltonian governing the _ spin _ degrees of freedom , @xmath33 , with @xmath34.@xcite for our test case of si(111)/si , the values of the hoppings are such that @xmath35 while the remaining couplings @xmath36 are very small .",

    "zero temperature long range order ( lro ) of the three - sublattice @xmath37-nel type  a commensurate spiral spin density wave ( s - sdw )  is nevertheless likely to occur for the spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with n.n .",

    ", we expect for large values of @xmath1 a wide - gap mott insulator with a s - sdw ( spins lying in a plane , forming @xmath37 angles ) , and a @xmath3 _ magnetic _ unit cell .",

    "* strong inter - site repulsion : an asymmetric cdw with three inequivalent sites .",
    "* the e - ph coupling can effectively reduce @xmath1 , but not @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to consider the hypothetical regime @xmath40 . in order to minimize the interaction energy ,",
    "the system will prefer a @xmath3 cdw with two electrons on one sublattice ( a ) , a single electron on another sublattice ( b ) , and zero electrons on the third sublattice ( c ) .",
    "( see fig .  2 . )",
    "the spin degeneracy associated with the ( unpaired ) electron on sublattice b can be removed , owing to @xmath41 , which leads to an effective spin-1/2 heisenberg hamiltonian within sublattice b , with a weak antiferromagnetic exchange constant @xmath42.@xcite .",
    "summarizing , we expect in this regime a strong @xmath3 asymmetric cdw with three inequivalent sites ( a - cdw ) , and a spiral @xmath43 sdw , governing the unpaired electron spins , superimposed on it .",
    "this a - cdw is not compatible with the experimental findings on pb - sn / ge , but it could be realized in some other case .    *",
    "mean - field theory*. in order to get an idea of any additional phases for smaller @xmath1 , and of the possible phase diagram of the model we turn to a mean field analysis .",
    "the first issue is the possibility of magnetism . for small values of the interactions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the stoner criterion can be used to study the instability of the paramagnetic metal obtained from lda calculations .",

    "the wavevector @xmath49 at which @xmath47 first diverges , by increasing @xmath1 , is in general incommensurate with the underlying unit cell .",
    "the instability is towards an incommensurate metallic spiral sdw.@xcite as for the charge susceptibility , a divergence can be caused only by an attractive fourier component of the potential @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath50 has a minimum at the bz corners @xmath51 , with @xmath52 .",
    "( @xmath53 if a coulomb tail is added ) .",
    "this minimum leads to an instability towards a @xmath3 cdw as @xmath54 .    in general ,",
    "the small coupling paramagnetic metal is surrounded by an intermediate coupling region , where complicated incommensurate  generally metallic  solutions occur . for stronger",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 , commensurate solutions are privileged.@xcite in view of the fact that a @xmath3 cdw is experimentally relevant , we concentrate our analysis on the simplest commensurate phases .",
    "these are easy to study with a standard hartree - fock ( hf ) mean - field theory.@xcite in particular , we restrict ourselves to order parameters associated with momentum space averages of the type @xmath55 and @xmath56 , i.e. , the uniform magnetization density @xmath57 , the @xmath58-component of the charge density @xmath59 , and the @xmath58-component of the spin density @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 have phase freedom , and are generally complex : @xmath63 , etc .",
    "the role of the phase is clarified by looking at the real - space distribution within the @xmath3 unit cell . for the charge , for instance , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , respectively , on sublattice a , b , and c. the e - ph coupling is included but , after linearization",
    ", the displacement order parameter is not independent , and is given by @xmath66 . only the phonon modes at @xmath67 couple directly to the cdw .",
    "the phonon part of the hamiltonian can be diagonalized by displacing the oscillators at @xmath67 .",
    "this gives just an extra term in the electronic hf hamiltonian of the form @xmath68 , with an energy @xmath69 which is the relevant coupling parameter .",
    "this term acts , effectively , as a negative-@xmath1 contribution acting only on the charge part of the electronic hamiltonian .",
    "the mean - field solutions must be compatible with the symmetry of the problem .",

    "it lies above the s - sdw by only a small energy difference ( of order @xmath79 per site ) , and it could be stabilized by other factors ( e.g. , spin - orbit ) .",
    "a recent lsda calculation for @xmath4-si / si(111 ) has indicated this z - sdw as the ground state , at least if spins are forced to be collinear.@xcite the hf bands for this solution are shown in fig .",
