    "both of these systems are noteworthy ; the one - dimensional rotation curve of shizels10 ( extracted from the major kinematic axis ) appears regular and suggests rotation , but the two - dimensional velocity field reveals extended ( @xmath45kpc ) emission to the east , which may be due to a companion or tidal material .",
    "the dynamics of the other galaxy classified as a merger , shizels14 , are clearly more complex .",

    "qualitatively , the one- and two - dimensional velocity field of shizels14 are consistent with an early stage prograde encounter , with each component in the merger displaying approximately equal peak - to - peak velocity gradients .",

    "equally , since any measurement of the observed peak - to - peak rotational velocity ( v@xmath61 ) is sensitive to the radius at which it has been possible to detect the dynamics , this measurement varies from both object - to - object depending on both the extent of the galaxy and signal - to - noise of the observations and can therefore give biased measurements when comparing samples .",
    "a more robust measurement is that of the velocity at 2.2 times the disk scale length ( v@xmath62 ) .",
    "this has a better physical basis since it measures the peak rotational velocity for a pure exponential disk @xcite and provides the closest match the radio ( 21 cm ) line widths for local galaxies @xcite .",
    "of course , the light profile of high - redshift galaxies are unlikely to follow pure exponential disk profiles , but it provides a reasonable estimate of where the rotation curve flattens , and as we will see below , is a good approximation of both v@xmath61 and v@xmath32 in our data . to measure v@xmath62 in our data , we therefore measure the h@xmath0 intensity as a function of radius in our galaxies ( centered at the dynamical center and using the inclination and position angle set by the best fit two - dimensional kinematic model ) and infer the disk scale length ( which ranges from 0.72.7kpc and has a median of 1.8@xmath110.7kpc ) .",
    "we then measure the rotational velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths and report these in table  3 .",
    "the errors on these quantities are derived from both the errors on the observed velocity at this radius and the formal errors on the two - dimensional model velocity fields .",

    "this behavior is consistent with the previous demonstration that star - forming galaxies at high - redshift have lower stellar masses and higher @xmath5-band luminosities .",
    "the strongest evolution occurs up to @xmath121 , @xmath6m@xmath18/l@xmath8=1.1@xmath110.2 , consistent with previous studies @xcite ( the fractional change in mass - to - light ratio over this period is @xmath6(m / l@xmath80)/(m / l@xmath8)@xmath93.5 between @xmath1=1.5 and @xmath1=0 , with most of the evolution occuring below @xmath1=1 ) .",
    "we note that we examined whether the evolution in the mass - to - light ratio could be reproduced using simple star - formation histories , ranging from i ) a constant star - formation rate ( with a formation redshift , @xmath81=48 ) ; or ii ) a set of exponentially decreasing star - formation rates with @xmath82-folding times ranging from 0.2510gyr ( and formation redshifts ranging from @xmath81=210 ) .",
    "however , using these simple star - formation histories ( adopting a chabrier imf with 0.51 solar metallicities and the padova ( 1994 ) stellar evolution tracks ) , we are unable to find a acceptable fit with a single star - formation history .",
    "this could be because the `` average '' star - formation history is more complex than a simple star - formation model , or because the current low and high - redshift data can not be linked by a simple evolutionary model .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlz ] we also overlay the predicted evolution of the @xmath5-band mass - to - light ratio from the semi - analytic models of @xcite and @xcite , both of which predict a sharp decline to @xmath121 and then flattening to higher redshift , which provides a reasonable match to the observations .      in a @xmath83cdm cosmology",

    "first , we note that the h@xmath0 half - light radii for the shizels galaxies ( @xmath84=2.4@xmath110.8kpc ) are comparable to the average rest - frame uv / optical half light radii of star - forming galaxies at this redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in order to compare to @xmath1=0 data , we show the measurements of local disks from @xcite ( which is based on a compilation from @xcite and @xcite ) , but converting the disk scale length ( r@xmath85 ) to half - light radius using r@xmath86=1.68r@xmath85 , as appropriate for a disk with an exponential profile .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , the high - redshift galaxies have half - light sizes ( deconvolved for seeing ) which are smaller for fixed circular velocity than those at @xmath1=0 .",
    "fitting the local the @xmath1=0 relation to the high - redshift data ( only allowing a zero - point shift and inverse weighting the fit by the errors on each data - point ) suggests that this offset is a factor @xmath87/r@xmath88=1.4@xmath110.3 , which is consistent ( given the smaller number statistics in the high - redshift measurements ) with that predicted from halo",
    " disk scaling arguments ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the product of the rotational velocity and size of the disk define the specific angular momentum , and the evolution ( at a fixed circular velocity ) with redshift also encodes information on the relation between the star - formation processes in the disk and the halo spin parameters ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "if high - redshift disks evolve into local disk galaxies , then the specific angular momentum must be increased , either by removing material with low specific angular momentum through outflows , or the galaxy disk must decouple from the halo and acquire angular momentum from accreting gas .    finally , in fig .",

    "can only be measured with limited accuracy , usually through the [ nii]/h@xmath0 emission - line ratio as an indicator of oxygen abundance and calibrations between gas phase emission line and stellar absorption metallicities , such as those obtained by @xcite .",
    "recently , the first reliable spatially resolved measurements of [ nii]/h@xmath0 have been made in two highly amplified galaxies at @xmath121.52.5 , measuring strong , negative gradients and suggesting that if @xmath122 starbursts evolve into spiral disks today , then the gradients must flatten by @xmath6log(o / h)/@xmath6r@xmath40.050.1dexkpc over the last 810gyr @xcite .",
    "other studies at lower resolution have derived weaker gradients that are negative , or consistent with zero for rotating and interacting galaxies @xcite .",
    "positive gradients for interacting systems may be a signature of the redistribution of the metal - rich gas produced from a central starburst ; @xcite , or possibly as a result of inflow of relatively unenriched gas from the halo ( or igm ) if it is able to intersect the central regions of the disk galaxy without being disrupted .    with our high - resolution ( and high signal - to - noise )",
    "resolved observations we can measure the spatially resolved emission line ratios and hence the distribution of chemical abundances .",
    "first , we note that the average galaxy integrated [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratio for the galaxies in our sample is [ nii]/h@xmath0 = 0.27@xmath110.09 , which corresponds to 12+log(o / h)=8.58@xmath110.07 ( equivalently , @xmath40.73@xmath110.16z@xmath2 where z@xmath2 is 12+log(o / h)=8.66@xmath110.05 ; @xcite ) .",

    ". first we subtract the large - scale velocity motions from the data - cube ( as defined by the best - fit dynamical model ) .",
    "we then use the disk inclination and position angle to define @xmath41kpc annuli ( centered at the dynamical center ) and integrate the spectrum in each annulus to measure the [ n ii]/h@xmath0 ratio . in fig .",
    "[ fig : shizels_gradient ] we show the h@xmath0 emission line maps as well as the spatially resolved [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratio and overlay the best - fit linear regression in each case .",
    "we report the gradients individually in table  2 . in all cases ,",
    "the metallicity gradients are negative or consistent with zero , with an average @xmath6log(o / h)/@xmath6r=@xmath100.027@xmath110.005dexkpc@xmath3 , and similar to those recently found for a sample of @xmath121 starbursts @xcite .",
    "this average gradient is steeper , but consistent with the thick disk of the milky - way , @xmath6log(o / h)/@xmath6r=@xmath100.01@xmath110.02dexkpc@xmath3 @xcite , which has a mass weighted age of 812gyr ( equivalently , a formation redshift @xmath1=24 ; @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgrad ] we compare the metallicity gradients to those from the gimic simulation ( which include cold gas accretion from the igm ) .",
    "we calculate the disc phase metallicity in cylindrical coordinates ( along the disc ) at @xmath1=0 , 1 , 2 & 3 in radial bins of width 1kpc for all galaxies in the simulation with masses between m@xmath18=10@xmath94m@xmath2 . at @xmath122 , the model disk galaxies from the gimic simulation display negative metallicity gradients which are consistent with our observations",
    ". moreover , between @xmath1=2 and @xmath1=0 the gimic simulation predicts that the gradient should flatten by a factor @xmath42 . in the simulation , this is a consequence of the outer disk enrichment increasing with decreasing redshift ( as the gas inflow rates decline and gas is redistributed ) progressively flattening the radial gradient within the thick disk .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the numerical models of @xcite and where the `` cold streams '' ( which are most prevalent around @xmath122 ) penetrate the halo and intersect and deposit relatively unenriched gas at onto the galaxy disks at @xmath415kpc @xcite .",
    "we have presented ao - assisted , spatially resolved spectroscopy of nine star - forming galaxies at @xmath1=0.842.23 selected from the ukirt , wide - field narrow - band , hizels survey @xcite .",

    "at least six galaxies have dynamics that suggest that their ionised gas is in a large , rotating disk ( in at least four of these we detect the turn over in their rotation curves ) . for these galaxies that resemble rotating systems , we model the galaxy velocity field and derive the inclination - corrected , asymptotic velocity .",

    "the weak evolution in the stellar mass tully - fisher relation ( in particular below @xmath121 ) is due to the fact that individual galaxies evolve along the scaling relations rather than due to weak evolution in the galaxies themselves ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and indicates that the baryon conversion efficiency , @xmath76=(m@xmath96/m@xmath77)/(@xmath78/@xmath79 ) , is fixed with redshift .",

    "if the @xmath122 and @xmath1=0 disks are linked in a simple evolutionary scenario then high - redshift disks must acquire specific angular momentum , either by removing material with low specific angular momentum ( e.g.  through outflows ) , or through acquisition of angular momentum from accreted gas at late times .",
