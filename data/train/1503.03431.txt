    "origin of sub - ev scale neutrino masses and large leptonic mixing is one of the biggest unresolved mysteries in particle physics . due to the absence of right",
    "handed neutrinos in the standard model ( sm ) , neutrinos remain massless at renormalizable level .",
    "several beyond standard model ( bsm ) frameworks have been proposed to explain tiny neutrino masses observed by neutrino oscillation experiments more than a decade ago @xcite .",
    "more recently , the experiments like t2k @xcite , double chooz @xcite , daya - bay @xcite and reno @xcite have not only confirmed the earlier measurements but also discovered a small but non - zero reactor mixing angle .",
    "two different sets of latest global fit values for @xmath0 range of neutrino oscillation parameters given in @xcite and @xcite are shown in table [ tab : data1 ] and [ tab : data2 ] respectively .",
    ".global fit @xmath0 values of neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "assuming the charged lepton mass matrix to be diagonal , we have studied all possible texture zeros in the majorana neutrino mass matrix that are allowed by latest neutrino oscillation data as well as the planck bound on the sum of absolute neutrino masses and constrain them further from the requirement of producing correct baryon asymmetry of the universe through the mechanism of leptogenesis .",
    "the allowed majorana texture zeros broadly fall into two categories : one - zero texture and two - zero texture .",
    "there are six different one - zero textures all of which are allowed by latest oscillation and cosmology data and hence we consider all of them in our analysis . out of fifteen possible two - zero textures , only six are compatible with oscillation data and the planck bound , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we have first derived the most general majorana neutrino mass matrix in terms of the neutrino best fit values as well as the free parameters : lightest neutrino mass , dirac cp phase and two majorana phases . comparing this mass matrix to a specific type of texture zero mass matrix we arrive at one or two complex constraints relating some or all of the free parameters . since in case of one - zero texture we have only one complex and hence two real constraints but four free parameters , we assume the equality between two majorana phases so that we can write them as a function of dirac cp phase . in case of two - zero textures , we have two complex and hence four real constraints that allow us to find all the four free parameters numerically .",
    "we get several solutions for @xmath1 all of which give @xmath2 of the same order of magnitude but different possible values of phases .",
    "we list one such set of solutions for each two - zero texture in table [ table-2zero1 ] and [ table-2zero2 ] .",
    "since all the free neutrino parameters are numerically determined in this case , any future measurement of dirac cp phase in neutrino experiments will verify or falsify some of these sets of solutions .",
    "the summary of our baryon asymmetry results in one - zero texture models is given in table [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] .",
    "it can be seen from these tables that in the one - flavor regime , all one - zero textures can give rise to correct baryon asymmetry depending upon the hierarchy of light neutrino masses",
    ". however , in two flavor regime , only @xmath3 with nh and @xmath4 with ih can give rise to correct baryon asymmetry .",
    "in the three flavor regime , @xmath3 with nh and @xmath5 with ih can give rise to correct baryon asymmetry .",
    "the summary of results in two - zero texture models are shown in table [ table5 ] . in one flavor regime ,",
    "all the two - zero texture mass matrices except @xmath6 can give rise to correct @xmath7 , depending on the neutrino mass hierarchy . for two flavor regime , only @xmath8 with ih can give rise to the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "similarly , in three flavor regime @xmath9 with both ih , nh and @xmath10 with only ih can produce correct @xmath7 .",
    "thus if @xmath11 gev , then all the allowed two - zero textures except @xmath12 are disfavored in the light of baryon asymmetry .",
    "for the two - zero texture mass matrices that give correct baryon asymmetry , we also constrain the entries in the diagonal dirac neutrino mass matrices as can be seen from figures [ fig8 ] to [ fig25 ] .    in all the tables",
    "mentioned above , the symbol @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is used when the baryon asymmetry @xmath7 for a particular case in ( not in ) the range given by the planck experiment . as we mention above , here we have tried to discriminate between all possible majorana neutrino textures by demanding the observed baryon asymmetry to arise from leptogenesis through the cp violating decay of the lightest right handed neutrino .",
    "we have not only constrained the number of texture zero mass matrices , but also constrained the parameters of the neutrino mass matrix which are yet undetermined in experiments .",
    "we should however , note that although a certain number of texture zero mass matrices with a particular light neutrino mass hierarchy do not give rise to correct baryon asymmetry , this does not rule out that particular texture as there could be some other source of baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "our analysis in this work only provide a guideline for future works related to model building in neutrino physics attempting to understand the dynamical origin of neutrino mass and mixing .",
