    "low - energy nuclear processes that involve a few nucleons can be described in a systematic and consistent way , thanks to the heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) which has been initiated by the pioneering work of weinberg  @xcite .",
    "this noble approach has been applied to many low - energy processes with great successes ; see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite .    motivated with these successes ,",
    "many already applied the chiral perturbation theory to dilute systems  @xcite and also to systems around the saturation density  @xcite .",
    "when the density and the corresponding fermi momentum @xmath4 increases , however , the convergence of free - space hbchpt becomes questionable .",
    "this is because hbchpt is a derivative expansion scheme with the expansion parameter @xmath5 ; @xmath6 stands for the typical momentum scale ( and/or the pion mass ) of the process , and @xmath7 gev is the chiral scale . in nuclear matter , @xmath8 even for small fluctuations whose typical energy - momentum scale is much smaller than @xmath4 . for such fluctuations , the contribution of the nucleons whose momenta far from the fermi surface is however irrelevant .",
    "it is thus desirable to build an effective field theory ( eft ) by integrating out such `` _ massive _ degrees of freedom '' , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the cutoff of the theory .",
    "the resulting eft has two expansion parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 represents the energy - momentum scale of the external probes and/or the pion mass , @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting eft is thus meaningful only when @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these expansion parameters will emerge naturally in the power counting rule of the matrix elements of the physical processes , and the perturbative expansion will follow this counting rule as is the case in the hbchpt where only the expansion scale is @xmath17 . as we shall see later , the new expansion scale @xmath16 could be threatened to approach to one when the density of the nuclear medium becomes large . but as we shall show later , the power counting rule shows that the matrix elements depends on the @xmath12 to twice of the number of loops that consist only of nucleon lines .",
    "this guarantees the rapid convergence in the dilute situation . in this work , however , we limit ourselves to a modest case where @xmath18 , which allows the expansion both in @xmath11 and in @xmath12 .",
    "this is the region that can be treated by the hbchpt .",
    "however , the eft that we are developing here has two important advantages over the hbchpt .",
    "firstly , the eft has only relevant degrees of freedom ( integrating out the irrelevant ones ) , which is the key aspect of efts that enables us to describe the nature systematically and consistently in a transparent manner . secondly , since the convergence with respect to powers of @xmath11 is much faster than that of @xmath12 , substantial reduction of the relevant diagrams can be achieved .",
    "the coefficients of the resulting eft lagrangian , _",
    "i.e. _ , low - energy constants ( lecs ) , will be in general different from those in the vacuum and must be determined from qcd . at this moment , we do not have any suitable ways to match our eft directly with qcd .",
    "instead we fix them by matching the eft with the hbchpt ; the fermi momentum of the matching point should be upper - bounded by the validity region of hbchpt and lower - bounded by that of our eft .",
    "once the lecs are fixed , we determine the @xmath4-dependences of the physical quantities by including the ( nucleon-)loop corrections .    before going further , we acknowledge that the idea of building eft near the fermi surface is not new at all . for example",
    ", the familiar landau - migdal fermi theory is one of such .",
    "the work of schwenk _",
    "et al_.  @xcite also is worthy to be noted , where the notion of the @xmath19  @xcite has been applied to derive the parameters of the landau - migdal theory .",
    "especially our work shares much in common with the high density effective theory ( hdet ) developed by hong  @xcite and by schfer  @xcite , which is an eft for quark matter at high - dense region where the matching with the ( perturbative ) full qcd is possible . compared to the hdet , our prime interests lie in the intermediate density ( rather than the asymptotic ) region where the ( almost massless ) goldstone bosons exist and the relevant fermion degrees of freedom are still nucleons .",
    "however , our approach may extend its applicability to the region where the chiral quarks are the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "our present study might be relevant for the recent pionic atom experiment at gsi with heavy nuclei , where the pion decay constant is interpreted to decrease that may signal the partial chiral symmetry restoration in medium  @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper our first step to make the in - medium eft .",
    "our explicit degrees of freedom are nucleons near the fermi surface , @xmath20 and the goldstone bosons . as is claimed recently by one of us ( mh )  @xcite , the role played by vector mesons at high density should not be underestimated to realize the important phase of matter at the transition , the vector manifestation ( vm )  @xcite . especially , we believe it is very important to understand how this phase is connected from the normal nuclear matter .",
    "our model indeed stems from the purpose of its realization . in the present report",
    ", we are however much modest to consider only the pion degrees of freedom .",
    "the underlying rationale lies in the decimation process at hand .",
    "our theory will allow the shallow excitation nearby the fermi surface up to , say , the pionic mass scale .",
    "those modes beyond it will be integrated out from the beginning . in a sense",
    ", our model will meet the limit of the applicability if the actual mass of certain integrated - out degrees of freedom becomes lighter as the density increases .",
    "this phenomena will emerge in our eft when the parameters do not satisfy the _",
    "naturalness_. in this respect , it will be sought in the forthcoming work to include the chiral partner of pion in the dense limit .",
    "it is worth mentioning some of our anstze .",
    "we are dealing with a dilute system in which loop corrections to the 4-fermi type interaction are suppressed by some powers of @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the most important channel is assumed to be the forward scattering one as in the fermi liquid  @xcite , which builds landau s fermi liquid theory  @xcite . in the present analysis ,",
    "we neglect bcs phenomena .",
    "the incorporation of the bcs channel is postponed to the next step .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we give a brief illustration to define the field expressing the fluctuation mode of the nucleon in section  [ sec : cqf ] and list first few terms in section  [ list ] . in section  [ pcount ] , we build the power counting rule for our effective lagrangian and list more higher order terms .",

    "in this section , we will define the field corresponding to soft modes of the fluctuation around the fermi surface and obtain the higher order correction terms in the present model scheme .",

    "but for the notational simplicity , we refer to @xmath23 as the in - medium mass @xmath27 throughout this paper .    in order to consider the fluctuation mode around the fermi surface , we introduce the following field @xmath28 : @xmath29 where the fermi velocity @xmath30 is related to the fermi momentum @xmath24 as @xmath31 simply the sum of @xmath32 means the angle sum on the fermi surface . by using the field @xmath33 in eq .",

    "in this section , we will present our effective lagrangian .",
    "as stressed in introduction , we are considering the moderate density region .",
    "so the mesons other than the pion are expected to be still heavier than the pion , i.e. , the pion is the only light mesonic degree of freedom realized as the pseudo nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson associated with the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . in the present analysis ,",
    "therefore , we build an effective lagrangian including the field expressing the fluctuation of the nucleon around the fermi surface , @xmath59 , together with the ng boson field , based on the non - linear realization of chiral symmetry by assuming that all the other mesons are integrated out .",
    "as we illustrated in introduction , we are considering the nucleon carrying the momentum inside the thin shell of size @xmath74 around the fermi surface .",
    "then , the momentum of the fluctuation parallel to the fermi velocity at the reference point is restricted to be smaller than @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , we only consider the situation where the momentum of the fluctuation mode perpendicular to the fermi velocity is also smaller than @xmath75 by assuming that effects from mode carrying large perpendicular momenta are already integrated out and included in the parameters of the effective lagrangian .",
    "this idea is based on landau s fermi liquid theory where the forward scattering channel is most important@xcite and which works well in nuclear physics  @xcite . and",
    "such a scheme is being used in hdet for quark matter  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present analysis , we divide the thin shell around the fermi surface into small boxes , each of which is characterized by the point on the fermi surface with the characteristic vector , @xmath30 .",

    "<S> an effective theory to treat the dense nuclear medium by the perturbative expansion method is proposed as a natural extension of the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) . treating the fermi momentum scale as a separate scale of the system , we get an improved convergence and the conceptually clear interpretation . we compute the pion decay constant and the pion velocity in the nuclear medium , and find their characters different from what the usual hbchpt predicts . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the debye screening scale at the normal nuclear matter density , and the damping scale of the pion wave . </S>",
    "<S> those results indicate that the present theory , albeit its improvement over the hbchpt , has the limitation yet to go over to the medium of about 1.3 times of normal matter density due to the absence of the intrinsic density dependence of the coupling constants . </S>",
