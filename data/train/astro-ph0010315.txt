    "the past five years have witnessed the remarkable birth of a new research field of astronomy  the physical study of substellar objects outside the solar system .",
    "large scale optical and near - infrared surveys of the sky ( denis , 2mass and sdss ) have revealed very cool objects that are close to us but nevertheless were unknown .",
    "the overwhelming majority of substellar objects in the field , however , can not be detected by ground - based surveys ; such objects cool very rapidly with time and become extremely faint at wavelengths shorter than about 4  @xmath2 m .",
    "sirtf ( fanson et al . 1998 ) will allow to probe deeper in the substellar regime , extending the census of substellar objects in the field to lower masses and temperatures ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the separation between brown dwarfs and planets is a matter of convention .",
    "we concur with other authors ( e.g. , basri & marcy 1997 ; oppenheimer et al .",
    "2000 ) in arguing that a definition based on the well known laws of gravitation and nuclear physics is more reliable than a definition based on the origin of the objects .",
    "thus , we adopt the following definitions : a brown dwarf is an object unable to stabilize on the hydrogen burning main - sequence , but able to fuse deuterium into helium . for solar metallicity the mass range of brown dwarfs is between 0.075  m@xmath6 and 0.013  m@xmath6 ( baraffe et al .",
    "1998 , saumon et al . 1996 ) .",
    "planets are objects unable to fuse deuterium , i.e. , they have masses lower than 0.013  m@xmath6 .",
    "`` isolated planets '' are planets that are not bound to any particular star .",
    "recent results suggest that this kind of planets may be numerous in the disk of the galaxy ( bjar et al .",
    "2000 ; zapatero osorio et al .",
    "the smooth transition of the mass function from the brown dwarfs to the isolated planets indicates that they have a common origin , which is much like that of star formation from fragmentation and collapse of molecular clouds , but not like the planets in our solar system ( accretion in a protoplanetary disk ) . despite of their different origins",
    ", isolated planets may have the same basic properties ( overall chemical composition , luminosity , temperature ) as their counterparts orbiting stars .",
    "studies show that the number of substellar objects increases towards lower masses .",
    "the functional form of this relationship , the initial mass function ( imf hereafter ) , can be approximated by a power law dn / dm @xmath3 m@xmath7 ( salpeter 1955 ) . for masses between 0.1  m@xmath6 and 0.01  m@xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath3 100 and 10  m@xmath8 , respectively ) , several surveys in young open clusters have found @xmath9 .",
    "( bjar et al .",
    "2000 , hillenbrand & carr 2000 ; martn et al .",
    "2000 ; najita et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the density of field brown dwarfs discovered by denis and 2mass is also consistent with this mass function ( reid et al .",
    "the number of substellar objects in each cluster , or in the field , is still small .",
    "hence the statistical uncertainties are large and it is not possible to conclude if there are significant variations in the imf from one region to another .",
    "the cooling curves of brown dwarfs and planets imply that they spend a large part of their lives at extremely low luminosities and cool temperatures .",
    "the launch of the sirtf satellite provides an unprecedented opportunity for detecting ultracool substellar objects .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 gives a brief description of the expected spectra of ultracool substellar objects and justifies the need for sirtf to detect them ; section 3 discusses observational strategies to detect substellar objects with sirtf ; section 4 provides estimates of the counts of substellar objects in the disk that can be detected with sirtf ; and section 5 summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "we have used calculations for solar composition substellar objects .",
    "these models will be described in detail in a forthcoming paper ( marley et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "we limit this presentation to a brief discussion of results that are relevant for our purposes .    with decreasing temperature",
    "the molecular bands of methane and water depress the flux at optical and near - infrared wavelengths . at temperatures below @xmath3700  k ,",
    "substellar objects emit very little flux shortward of 4  @xmath2 m ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "in fact , the coolest known brown dwarfs , namely gl  570  d , has a temperature of 790@xmath1050  k ( burgasser et al .",
    "its spectrum is similar to that of gl  229  b.    it is unlikely that the denis and 2mass surveys will detect any objects significantly cooler than gl  570  d. with j@xmath11 and m@xmath12 , this object is near the detection limit of 2mass ( j@xmath13 ; and , j@xmath14 for denis ) . a substellar object 200  k cooler would have an absolute j - band magnitude about 1.5 mag fainter ( burrows et al . 1997 ) , and to be detected by these surveys it would have to be 2 times closer , i.e. , at 3  pc .",
    "there are 6 stellar systems within 3  pc of the sun , and there could be a similar number of brown dwarfs",
    ". however , the chances that 2mass will detect them may be negligible if the near - infrared spectrum is depleted by strong water bands .",
    "preliminary models ( marley 2000 ) , illustrated here in figure  3 , provide a glimpse of what these substellar objects may look like .",
    "water clouds will first appear in objects with @xmath15 below @xmath3600",
    "k. the clouds will first form as tenuous stratus clouds high in the atmosphere and then form lower in the atmosphere in cooler objects where they will be thicker and more substantial . for @xmath15 below @xmath3300",
    "k , ammonia clouds will form .",
    "jupiter s water clouds are hidden below two higher cloud layers and are poorly understood .",
    "thus sirtf provides the opportunity to detect the first substellar mass objects outside our solar system in which water clouds dominate the atmosphere .",
    "water clouds will substantially alter the infrared spectra of these objects .",
    "t - dwarfs like gliese 229 b are blue in j - k .",
    "once water clouds form , the j - k color will move redward towards j - k   0 to 1 ( marley and ackerman 2000 ) . a new spectral class , p for example ,",
    "could be necessary for classifying these objects cooler than the t dwarfs .",
    "based on near - ir colors ( jhk ) alone , it will be very difficult to distinguish the p - type brown dwarfs from background m - stars with similar colors .",
    "brown dwarfs with clear atmospheres , like the t - dwarfs , are bright at 4 to 5 um ( marley et al . 1996 ; burrows et al .",
    "1997 ) . as with jupiter , marley and ackerman ( 2000 )",
    "find that the coolest brown dwarfs are also bright in this spectral region , even when water clouds are present ( figure  3 ) .",
    "thus a search with sirtf at 4 - 5um has the potential of easily discovering such objects .    as illustrated in figure  2 , the irac ( fazio et al .",
    "1998 ) passband at 4.5  @xmath2 m ( channel 2 ) offers the best sensitivity for detection of a 10 m@xmath8  object , particularly for old ages .",
    "2mass can detect a 10 m@xmath8  isolated planet only if it is about 0.1  gyr old and is located at a distance of less than 10 pc .",
    "it is unlikely that such an object exists . on the other hand",
    ", sirtf can provide a 5  @xmath1 detection in 720  s of a 10 m@xmath8  isolated planet with an age of 0.1  gyr out to 350  pc at 4.5  @xmath2 m and 200  pc at 3.6  @xmath2 m .",
    "sirtf can also detect a 10 m@xmath8  isolated planet at an age 1  gyr up to a distance of 120  pc at 4.5  @xmath2 m and 40  pc at 3.6  @xmath2 m .",
    "the denis , 2mass and sdss surveys have demonstrated that free - floating brown dwarfs outnumber brown dwarf companions to stars by about a factor of 10 .",
    "these surveys combined have already discovered more than 200 free - floating brown dwarfs ( burgasser et al .",
    "1999 ; delfosse et al .",
    "1999 ; fan et al .",
    "2000 ; gizis et al .",
    "2000 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2000 ; leggett et al .",
    "2000 ; martn et al .",
    "1999 ) , but only three companion brown dwarfs to stars ( burgasser et al . 2000 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "moreover , high - precision radial velocity surveys have revealed a brown dwarf desert within a few au of g and k - type main - sequence stars ( halbwachs et al .",
    "they determine that there exists a secondary mass cutoff between 0.01 and 0.1 m@xmath6 .",
    "other searches for brown dwarf companions to stars have found only a few outstanding examples in samples of hundreds of stars ( becklin & zuckerman 1988 ; oppenheimer 1999 ) .",
    "these companions are very interesting but seem to be rare .",
    "the spatial resolution of sirtf ( fwhm=2\".3 with irac ) , and the lack of a coronograph , will not allow a jupiter mass planet at 5 au separation to be resolved , even for the closest stars .",
    "jupiter - mass planets may be common around stars , but they are unlikely to be found outside a 20  au radius of the parent star .",
    "the ice condensation region is located at about 5  au , with little dependence on the spectral type of the star , and gravitational instabilities in the disk are unlikely to be effective beyond 20 au ( boss 2000 ) .",
    "direct images of massive disks around t tauri stars indicate that in general the density is too low to allow for the formation of a giant planet beyond 20 a.u .",
    "( e.g. , krist et al . 2000 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the deep surveys of orion and ic  348 suggest that free - floating planets probably are very numerous ( najita et al 2000 ; zapatero osorio et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these considerations lead us to propose that a wide field imaging survey with sirtf is the best strategy to detect a large sample of substellar objects .",
    "we have used the sirtf planning observations tool ( spot ) to simulate future observations . with total exposure times of 720",
    "s per pointing ( divided into 24 exposures of 30  s for dithering and cosmic ray removal ) , we could make an irac map covering 1 square degree in 33.3 hours of observation time .",
    "the 5  @xmath1 sensitivity for point sources under conditions of low background are : 2.91  @xmath2jy in channel 1 , 3.88  @xmath2jy in channel 2 , 11.3  @xmath2jy in channel 3 , and 13.2  @xmath2jy in channel 4 . at these flux limits , the main contribution to source",
    "confusion comes from background galaxies we have estimated the number of galaxies and stars at the irac passbands using the predictions of franceschini et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and a modified version of the galaxy model of wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . the recent 7@xmath2 m isocam counts obtained by taniguchi et al .",
    "our calculations show that in irac channel 2 ( our most sensitive passband for substellar objects ) we expect to detect approximately 3,800 stars ( for high galactic latitude ) and 78,000 galaxies per square degree . if each galaxy is assumed to occupy @xmath16 pixels ( @xmath17 arcsec ) , then the galaxies will cover approximately 7% of the pixels . at fainter detection limits ,",
    "the crowding from galaxies is correspondingly greater .",
    "thus , more sensitive observations offer relatively diminishing returns for a much greater investment of observing time .    according to the fluxes predicted by our synthetic spectra",
    ", substellar objects can be identified unambiguously from irac photometry .",
    "in fact , it is enough with a 5  @xmath1 detection in channel 2 and no detection in the other channels .",
    "as shown by figure 4 , any object with log f(4.5@xmath2m)/f(3.6@xmath2 m ) @xmath18 0.3 can be considered as a good brown dwarf or planet candidate .",
    "neither stars nor galaxies contaminate the substellar locus . the location of flared and",
    "flat disks in figure  4 is based on results on the spectral index for t tauri star disks by kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) .",
    "the location of 30 doradus has been derived from iso sws measurements by sturm et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and the flux values for l@xmath19 galaxies at z=0.1 to 5 are based on simulations by fazio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "figure  4 also indicates that population iii brown dwarfs with effective temperatures below 400k are readily identified from their colors alone . still warmer ( and more massive ) population",
    "iii brown dwarfs occupy a region in the color - color plot that coincides with redshifted l * galaxies and with stars having debris disks which are intermediate between vega - type disks and the disks around classical and weak - line ttauri stars .",
    "additional information will therefore be needed to make a positive identification .",
    "two epochs of irac observations would facilitate an identification of the most nearby population iii brown dwarfs , based on their high proper motion ( and possibly their parallax ) .",
    "more distant candidates for massive population iii brown dwarfs will have to be followed up with instruments with higher instrinsic angular resolution , e.g. , ground - based 8-m to 10-m class telescopes , the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) , the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) , or the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) .",
    "we have estimated the number counts of substellar objects in the disk of the galaxy using the following ingredients : ( 1 ) theoretical fluxes computed from synthetic spectra ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "( 2 ) sensitivities for low - background from the irac manual .",
    "we have adopted a 5@xmath1 confidence level for our detection limit in each channel .",
    "( 3 ) a solar neighborhood density of 0.057 stellar systems / pc@xmath20 ( reid et al .",
    "( 4 ) power - law mass functions with @xmath5=1.5 , 1.0 and 0.5 from 100 to 1 m@xmath8  . ( 5 ) a constant star formation rate over the lifetime of the galactic disk ( from 0 to 10  gyr ) . ( 6 ) an exponential vertical distribution for distances beyond 50  pc , and a scale height of 325  pc , consistent with the counts of m dwarfs .",
    "a monte carlo code provided the cumulative number of substellar objects . in figure  5 , we show the cumulative distributions of objects with masses in the range 25 to 1 m@xmath8 for two different slopes of the imf power - law . for an imf with @xmath5 = 1.5 , we predict that sirtf could detect about 30 isolated planets per square degree . for @xmath5 = 1.0",
    ", the number of planets decreases to about 4 per square degree .",
    "we consider the hypothetical case that 600 hours of sirtf time would be dedicated for an irac survey to search for substellar objects .",
    "using spot we have estimated that an area of 18 square degrees could be covered with 5  @xmath1 sensitivity of 3.88  @xmath2jy in channel 2 .",
    "the cumulative distribution of substellar objects that such a survey would find ( for @xmath5 = 1.5 ) is given in figure  6 .",
    "we compare with another survey with which is less sensitive but covers a larger area ( 64  deg@xmath0 ) .",
    "both surveys require the same amount of sirtf observing time according to the spot program .",
    "the larger survey is less efficient due to larger overheads and the contribution of detector noise when the exposure times are shorter .",
    "more than 150 substellar objects with temperatures cooler than 600  k could be revealed in 18 square degrees .",
    "if the imf is shallower the number of objects would naturally be less .",
    "for @xmath5 = 1.0 we predict about 20 objects cooler than 600  k , and for @xmath5 = 0.5 we predict only three of them .",
    "sirtf observations can constrain the field mass function down to masses below the deuterium limit by counting the number of ultracool substellar objects .",
    "we have shown that irac channel 2 is very efficient for detecting ultracool substellar objects .",
    "we present an optimized observational strategy for detection of brown dwarfs and isolated planets with temperatures below 700  k. preliminary models indicate that the atmospheres of these objects are dominated by water clouds , which make the objects fainter at optical and near - infrared wavelengths than previously thought .",
    "the 5  @xmath2 m window is an excellent region for detecting them because their atmospheres are more transparent .",
    "our strategy consists of a sirtf survey with a 5  @xmath1 sensitivity of 3.88  @xmath2jy in irac channel 2 .",
    "we show that substellar objects can easily be identified in an irac color - color diagram .",
    "any object with log f(4.5@xmath2m)/f(3.6@xmath2 m ) @xmath18 0.3 can be considered as a good brown dwarf or planet candidate .",
    "neither stars nor galaxies contaminate the substellar locus . with our detection limit",
    ", we predict a density of 30 isolated planets per square degree for an imf with a slope @xmath5 = 1.5 . in 600 hours of sirtf time , an area of 18 square degrees would be covered .",
    "we predict that such a survey would find about 540 isolated planets , and about 160 substellar objects with temperatures cooler than 600  k. such objects can not be detected with the current generation of near - infrared all - sky surveys ( denis and 2mass ) . for shallower imf slopes , the number of substellar objects diminishes .",
    "thus , the proposed survey can determine the field substellar imf down to very low masses .",
