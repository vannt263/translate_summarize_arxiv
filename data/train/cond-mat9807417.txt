    "the critical behavior of models with long - range ( lr ) interactions has been considerably less explored than that of the short - range ( sr ) ones , especially for discrete models where the non - locality of interactions makes most of the standard methods ineffective .",
    "these models may , however , exhibit rather complicated critical behavior already in one dimension @xcite .",
    "recent attention has been driven to such models in the context of studying phenomena related to lr interactions@xcite , but also in view of possible equivalence with sr models@xcite .",
    "one of the interesting and still not clarified aspects of lr models is the possible onset of the first - order transition .",
    "the question naturally arises for the lr potts model , which in the sr interaction case is known to undergo a first - order phase transition when the number of states @xmath2 exceeds a certain limiting value which depends on dimensionality , @xmath3@xcite .",
    "we have recently pointed out @xcite that a similar behavior indeed can be observed in the @xmath4 potts model with interactions decaying with distance as @xmath0 and illustrated it on special cases @xmath5 and @xmath6 characteristic of the two regimes . on the basis of these preliminary monte carlo ( mc ) results on small chains for @xmath7 and @xmath8 ,",
    "we have concluded on the existence of a @xmath2-dependent threshold value @xmath9 separating the first- and the second - order transition regime .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on a more detailed study of the @xmath4 three - state potts model with @xmath10 .    as is well known , the first - order phase transitions are rather difficult to detect and study@xcite .",
    "most of standard renormalization group ( rg ) approaches do not distinguish them from the second - order transitions .    on the other hand monte carlo simulations , which in combination with finite - size scaling ( fss ) represent an efficient tool@xcite to solve this problem ,",
    "are limited when the first - order transition is weak , so that the correlation length , although finite , exceeds the considered system size .",
    "this problem is even more pronounced when dealing with lr interactions , where mc simulations become much more time consuming , no matter whether metropolis or different cluster algorithms are used .",
    "recently , luijten and blte@xcite have proposed a rather efficient algorithm which permits considering quite large sizes in spite of the long - range interactions .",
    "our intention is to use this approach here in order to perform a more systematic analysis of several quantities ( interface free energy , binder s fourth order cumulant , specific heat ) , which serve as criteria for distinguishing first- from second - order phase transition .",
    "the model we consider is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote three - state potts variables at sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , @xmath17 is the kronecker symbol and summation is taken over all pairs of the system .",
    "this model has a phase transition at finite temperature for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "no exact results exist for the related critical behavior . by analogy with the sr interaction case extended to arbitrary dimension",
    ", one expects to find a first - order phase transition for low values of @xmath1 and a crossover to a second - order phase transition above a certain threshold value @xmath19 .",
    "this has been confirmed by our preliminary mc results@xcite in @xmath4 lr potts model which lead to the conclusion , that for @xmath20 the transition is of the first - order when @xmath21 and of second order above it .",
    "the threshold @xmath9 is expected to depend on @xmath2 . for @xmath7 , the @xmath19 was estimated@xcite to lay above @xmath22 , the point separating the mean - field ( mf ) from the nontrivial critical regime in the ising ( @xmath23 ) case ( where the transition , by symmetry reasons ( see e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein ) , remains of the second order@xcite in both regimes ) . above the threshold @xmath19",
    ", the model undergoes a second - order transition with non - classical critical exponents depending on @xmath1 .",
    "several renormalization group approaches yield approximate values of these exponents , within continuous ginzburg - landau functional formalism @xcite or in real space @xcite .",
    "these latter approaches , however , appear to be insensitive to detect a first - order transition .    in the present approach we shall be using the mc algorithm , recently introduced by luijten and blte @xcite , designed for models with lr interactions .",
    "it is based on wolf s cluster algorithm @xcite and was applied to several mf related problems in the special ( ising ) case @xmath23@xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the method is the use of cumulative bond probabilities in building the cluster of connected bonds , which drastically reduces the number of operations required .",
    "the results coincide with those obtained with the simple wolf algorithm , but the cpu time can be reduced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "+ the basic quantity in our calculations is the energy probability distribution defined by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the inverse temperature , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the partition function , @xmath28 denotes the number of spin configurations corresponding to the energy @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the system size .",
    "several quantities used for the determination of the temperature driven first - order transition can be deduced from @xmath31 .",
    "we concentrate here on three most important ones : the interface free energy , the binder s fourth order cumulant@xcite , and specific heat .",
    "the interface free energy is obtained from the shape of the energy probabability distribution @xmath31 . for temperature driven first - order transitions , at the transition temperature",
    ", @xmath31 has two maxima , corresponding to the coexisting ordered and disordered phases .",
    "the interface free energy is then defined by @xmath32 where the finite - chain transition temperature @xmath33 has been defined by requiring that the two maxima are of equal height @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 denotes the minimum of @xmath31 between them .",
    "the scaling analysis of @xmath36 can be used to identify the first - order phase transition , even in the case of a weak first - order transition , where the correlation length , though finite , is large and comparable to the system size@xcite .",
    "when the transition is of the first - order , @xmath36 increases with size . for systems with sr interactions",
    "the interface free energy has the dimension of surface and scales as @xmath37 . in the present model with lr interactions",
    "it is expected to scale as a volume .",
    "the other two quantities can be derived from the higher energy momenta of @xmath31 , defined as @xmath38    the specific heat @xmath39 ( defined per spin in the remaining text ) is related to the second moment and defined for the system size @xmath30 by @xmath40 according to the fss theory , in the case of a second - order phase transition its maximum scales as @xmath41 while for the first - order one it simply scales as volume which in the present case means linear dependence on @xmath30 @xmath42    the calculation of the fourth moment gives binder s fourth order cumulant @xcite defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 in the present study , for practical reasons it is easier to deal with @xmath45 . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath46 tends to one , when @xmath47 . at @xmath48",

    "together with @xmath49 , @xmath50 appears as one of the most sensitive criteria for determination of first - order phase transitions @xcite .      before proceeding to the presentation of our numerical results ,",
    "let us summarize the only analytical results available for the considered model .",
    "they can be obtained in the limit @xmath52 of model ( 1 ) , where all the interactions are of equal strength and the coupling constant is redefined so that @xmath53 .",
    "this is the mean - field limit , which has been extensively studied in literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) and solved in the limit @xmath54 by saddle point method@xcite .",

    "the results for the characteristic quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 were not cited in literature . in order to obtain them ,",
    "we have used the lee and kosterlitz @xcite prescription for the energy probability distribution @xmath31 in the vicinity of the first - order transition temperature @xmath63 for large @xmath30 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the energies of ordered and disordered phases , respectively . the weight function @xmath68 which contains the entire temperature and @xmath30 dependence of @xmath31",

    "let us also point out that the characteristic temperatures related to the three quantities considered are different until the thermodynamic limit is reached .",
    "consequently , an independent numerical effort was needed for localizing the characteristic temperatures for each of those quantities for every @xmath30 and @xmath1 considered . by combining the ferrenberg - swendsen histogram method @xcite and direct calculations ,",
    "these temperatures have been calculated with numerical precision up to the fourth decimal digit in @xmath79 , which implies a numerical error of approximately 0.1% .",
    "we did not go beyond this precision in @xmath79 since the aspect of the calculated distribution @xmath31 is much rougher than the one obtained with the metropolis algorithm , when using a comparable number of steps . resulting numerical error in calculated quantities themselves varies from 1 - 5 % for @xmath31 and @xmath36 to 1 - 2% for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .      in fig .",
