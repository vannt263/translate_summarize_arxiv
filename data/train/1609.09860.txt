    "glass formers and spin glasses have been the subject of intense theoretical , experimental and numerical research in the last decades ( see for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these systems present similar phenomenology ( see for instance @xcite ) , analogous techniques have been developed in both @xcite , and their relationship has been proved @xcite .",
    "thus , in spite of the details about composition , structure or kind of degrees of freedom , it is common to use the word _",
    "glassy _ to refer to any material with a dynamics qualitatively similar to that of a glass  @xcite .",
    "the study of glassy systems poses a series of issues , related to the impossibility to reach equilibrium below the glass transition temperature @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", the system evolves for ever .",
    "however , the time dependence of the one - time observables , like density , energy , pressure or magnetization ( in a magnetic system ) is quite weak and hard to appreciate .",
    "_ aging _ effects are more clearly observed in the behavior of two - time observables , like the autocorrelation @xmath1 and response @xmath2 functions , which do not depend only on the time difference @xmath3 but on @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see , for example , @xcite )    an alternative is to study _ aging - to - equilibrium _",
    "@xcite , based in the idea that , if a system is quenched from an equilibrium state at a temperature @xmath6 to a lower temperature @xmath7 , the transition to equilibrium takes place on a time scale related to the equilibrium relaxation time @xmath8 , and it will show some aspects of glassy dynamics for @xmath9 . in @xcite ,",
    "two - time correlation functions were studied in both aging - to - equilibrium and aging regimes for a simple glass former . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors analyzed the aging - to - equilibrium dynamics for the strong glass former sio@xmath10 .",
    "most of the studies about glassy systems focus on _ macroscopic _ or global observables .",
    "nevertheless , in recent years _ microscopic _",
    "( i. e. , involving a single or few particle ) actions have been analyzed @xcite in structural glass formers , with the goal of understanding better the mechanisms responsible for aging . in @xcite ,",
    "the microscopic dynamics of sio@xmath10 were analyzed and related to the macroscopic dynamics .",
    "after a quench , _",
    "jump _ events , i. e. , particle movements greater than a certain threshold , were detected and their statistical properties were analyzed .",
    "the authors found that the number of jumping particles decreases strongly with @xmath11 , the time elapsed since the quench , reaching equilibrium at times compatible with @xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , jumps themselves ( average length , time duration , and even rest time between consecutive jumps ) do not depend on @xmath11 .",
    "jump events are not only closely related to macroscopic evolution observables like diffusivity @xcite but constitute an important ingredient in the relaxation of glass formers .",
    "they provide a link among structure and dynamics , by giving a more quantitative idea of the _ cage _ effect .",
    "this is the case in @xcite , where , for a 2d model at low temperature , it is found that non jumping particles were more likely in highly ordered environments .",
    "the relationship among jumps and dynamical heterogeneities has also been established @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study some microscopic aspects of the aging - to - equilibrium and aging dynamics of the well known 3d edwards - anderson ( ea ) spin - glass model @xcite .",
    "this model has been extensively studied in a macroscopic way .",
    "some microscopic results have also been reported @xcite , including the existence of a backbone @xcite .",
    "we start by generalizing the concept of jump , introduced originally for structural glass formers @xcite , to the case of a spin glass .",
    "we wish to analyze whether the above mentioned statistical properties of jump events can be reproduced in a glassy system composed of spins , instead of moving particles .",
    "for the ea model , we find that microscopic and macroscopic relaxation times behave similarly .",
    "we also find that some variables depend strongly on time while others are nearly stationary .",
    "thus , most of the results in @xcite for a structural glass former hold for this spin glass model .",
    "for instance , jump length and jump duration are roughly stationary , while the number of jumps depends strongly on @xmath11 . on the other hand",
    ", we find that rest time between jumps , which is independent of time in @xcite , has an inverse relation to jump frequency for the ea model .",

    "[ ejemplo1.0 ] , where we show all the previous data for @xmath105 in logarithmic scale .",
    "results are shifted ( multiplied by a constant ) to facilitate comparison .",
    "let us remark that while the number of jumps decreases by about one order of magnitude , other variables have negligible changes ( as in @xcite ) , with the only exception of rest time , which grows at long times .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors study jumping particles , while in this work we study jumps of boxes .",
    "these quantities behave similarly , however we have found a discrepancy in the behavior of the rest time ; which is roughly constant in @xcite . since , according to our simulations ( see , for example , fig .",
    "[ duracionyespera ] ) , there exist time dependence for this quantity , some words are in order .    for short enough times , i.  e. , for @xmath106 ,",
    "most of boxes jump once or never .",
    "the results corresponding to @xmath107 in fig .",
    "[ duracionyespera ] indicate that in this time interval ( @xmath108 mc steps ) jump duration is nearly constant . for longer times",
    "( @xmath109 ) , when most of jumping boxes do many jumps , it should exist some correlation between rest time and jump frequency .",
    "since jump duration is much smaller than time between jumps , the average number of jumps per unit time , multiplied by the rest time , should be equal to the total time multiplied the number of boxes , i.  e. , @xmath110 .",
    "thus , for long enough times , we expect that @xmath64 increases as @xmath62 decreases .",
    "notice that this is what happens if fig .",
    "[ ejemplo1.0 ] , where the long - time effective exponents for jump frequency ( @xmath111 ) and rest time ( @xmath112 ) are opposite ( @xmath113 ) within statistical error .",
    "the same happens for other temperatures , see table  [ slopetable ] .      in this subsection we present the results of several tests we carried out to analyze the robustness of the statistical properties of jump events .",
    "we have checked that the outcomes for @xmath23 are similar to those for @xmath24 .",
    "thus , most interesting results do not depend much on @xmath6 .",
    "we have also verified that doubling system size ( working with a system of size @xmath114 ) does not change the results within statistical error .",
    "also , we found qualitatively the same results for different unit times @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , though choosing smaller @xmath101 makes the decreasing of @xmath62 more pronounced .",
    "using an alternative definition of jumps , by changing the value of @xmath118 , also leads to the same qualitative behavior . for instance",
    ", a higher @xmath118 ( more restrictive definition , then fewer jumps ) makes effective exponent of @xmath62 more negative .",
    "for example , we can compare the results for @xmath56 , shown in fig .",
    "[ criteriacr0 ] , we those for @xmath55 , in fig .",
    "[ ejemplo1.0 ] .",
    "notice that , in first case , @xmath62 decreases by two orders of magnitude , while it decreases about one order of magnitude for the second .",
    "on the other hand , we can observe that in fig .",
    "[ criteriacr0 ] the rest time remains nearly constant for a longer period of time than in fig .",
    "[ ejemplo1.0 ] .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that , for @xmath56 the average of the rest time @xmath119 is of the order of @xmath25 ( while @xmath120 for @xmath55 ) .",
    "in addition , as @xmath119 is close to the total simulation time , it is impossible to evaluate the rest time of most jumps that happen at @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the largest values of rest times are neglected , and @xmath64 becomes underestimated . as a consequence ,",
    "the effective exponents leading @xmath62 and @xmath64 for @xmath56 , have values with opposite signs but not exactly the same absolute value ( @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) . for @xmath124 ,",
    "the proportion of neglected rest times is even greater , and we get both @xmath125 and @xmath126 negative .    we have also studied _ jump energy _ and _ jump magnetization _ , defined as the absolute value of the energy and magnetization differences of each box before and after the jump .",
    "these variables do not sensitively evolve with @xmath11 .",
    "the energy and magnetization of every box also become stationary well before @xmath88 .",
    "varying @xmath118 , we found that less frequent jumps are related to greater changes in magnetization and energy .",
    "we have explored the use of an alternative criteria of jump , with the same threshold for every box .",
    "that is , by considering that box @xmath15 is jumping at @xmath11 when @xmath127 , with the same constant @xmath128 for all boxes .",
    "we find that , since every box has a different quenched disorder , we get _ fast _ boxes jumping very frequently and _ slow _ boxes , jumping few times in the simulation time .",
    "so this definition gives some unwanted results ; related to the fact that rest time is severely underestimated at long @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we have tried other jump criteria by defining a jump when magnetization differences overcome a certain threshold . we have found similar results to the ones presented here using this alternative criteria .    .",
    "from top to bottom : rest time , jump duration , jump size , and jump frequency .",
    "sets of data points are shifted vertically to facilitate comparison .",
    "let us remark that @xmath129 , which explains why the absolute values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 ( indicated with straight lines ) do not coincide . ]",
    "the results of these tests give support to the idea that , in spite of the manner we define a jump , we always get a jump frequency which depends strongly on time , but jump properties ( with the exception of @xmath64 , at long times ) reach stationarity much before the equilibration time .",
    "in this work , we generalize the concept of jump , introduced in the context of glass formers  @xcite , to the case of spin glasses . we divide the system into boxes , and define a jump as a cooperative spin flipping making the overlap function of a box to decay below a certain amount in a small time interval @xmath101 .",
    "we study the statistical properties of these jumps as a function of the waiting time @xmath11 after a quench , for a edwards - anderson 3d model of spin glass .",
    "when this system is quenched to a temperature @xmath99 higher than the glass transition temperature @xmath22 , it reaches equilibrium after a characteristic time @xmath88 , which we determine numerically from the stabilization of the global two - time correlation function @xmath130 .",
    "we confirm that every statistical property of jumps becomes independent of time for @xmath131 .",
    "interestingly however , in the dynamics of relaxation towards equilibrium , we find that most one - time microscopic observables related to jumps become nearly stationary well before @xmath88 , similarly to what reported for structural glass formers  @xcite .",
    "the exception being the jump frequency , which is a clearly decreasing quantity for times much closer to the equilibration time ; @xmath132 .",
    "let us mention that even if at long enough times rest time is a growing observable , it evolves inversely to jump frequency , and , in this sense , it is not an independent quantity . for @xmath133 ,",
    "when the equilibration time diverges , we observe that all the measured microscopic observables depend on time , in the time interval that corresponds to our simulations .",
    "however , while jump duration and jump size change very slowly , jump frequency decreases much faster .",
    "this suggests that in the glass phase the number of jumps always decreases but jumps themselves are not @xmath11 sensitive at long times .",
    "these conclusions do not depend qualitatively on the chosen values of @xmath101 , system size , box size nor the details of the criteria to define a jump .",
    "in particular , if jumps are defined as a function of magnetization or energy changes instead of overlap changes , similar results are found .",
