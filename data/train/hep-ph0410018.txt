    "much progress has been made recently in understanding high energy hard scattering in qcd at or near the unitarity limit .",
    "general equations have been given by balitsky @xcite and by jalilian - marian , iancu , mclerran , leonidov , kovner and weigert ( jimwlk ) @xcite which generalize the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution @xcite to the region where unitarity ( saturation ) effects become important .",
    "the balitsky - jimwlk equations are nonlinear operator equations , while a `` mean field '' version of the equations , the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) @xcite equation , is a nonlinear equation for the scattering amplitude and has been widely studied recently .",
    "the scattering amplitude which emerges from the bk equation is , in general terms , characterized by the energy ( rapidity ) dependence of the saturation momentum @xmath0 @xcite , and by geometric scaling @xcite , the statement that the scattering amplitude @xmath1 is equal to a function of a single variable @xmath2 .",
    "however , it has not been clear to what level the general properties of solutions to the bk equation are shared by solutions to the balitsky - jimwlk equations .",
    "this is the problem we address in this note .",
    "our object is to describe the energy - dependence of the saturation momentum and the scaling properties of the scattering amplitude which should emerge from the balitsky - jimwlk equations .",
    "when viewed in a particular way the problem here looks identical to a class of problems studied recently in statistical physics @xcite . in the statistical physics problems",
    "the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( fkpp ) equation @xcite approximately describes the time evolution of certain quantities in some discrete systems . in the qcd problem of dipole - dipole scattering",
    "the bk equation describes the rapidity and @xmath3 dependence of the scattering amplitude . as has been noticed recently , the bk equation is in the same universality class as the fkpp equation and this fact gives a powerful and general derivation of the energy dependence of @xmath0 and of geometric scaling @xcite .",
    "the fkpp equation has limitations in applications to average quantities in discrete statistical systems . when the discreteness is not important , that is in a region where many `` objects '' are present , the fkpp equation is a good approximation to the actual evolution of the system .",
    "however , when only a few objects are involved discreteness effects are significant and the fkpp description breaks down @xcite .",
    "a similar effect occurs in qcd evolution , and this is seen most easily by viewing the scattering of an elementary dipole of size @xmath4 on an evolved dipole of initial size @xmath5 in terms of the @xmath6evolution of particular configurations of dipoles starting from @xmath7 ( the scattering amplitude is then given by an average over all possible configurations . )",
    "the dipoles making up a configuration are the discrete elements of our system .",
    "the importance of fluctuations due to discretness in qcd evolution was first noticed by salam from monte - carlo studies @xcite .",
    "more recently , the importance of fluctuations has been reiterated in the context of non - linear evolution in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the role of rare fluctuations in the approach of the s - matrix towards the unitarity limit has been discussed , and also in ref .",
    "@xcite , where jimwlk evolution has been reformulated as a random walk in some functional space , thus emphasizing its stochastic nature .",
    "this last formulation lies also at the basis of the numerical studies of jimwlk evolution in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "so long as the dipole occupancy in a configuration is large compared to one , use of the bk equation should be a good approximation for the evolution of our configuration .",
    "however , when there are only a few dipoles of size @xmath8 in our particular configuration bk evolution can not be expected to be accurate . indeed in a discrete picture occupancy can go below one only by becoming zero which stops the evolution along that path . thus , using the bk equation with a cutoff when dipole occupancy is near one , or equivalently when the scattering amplitude for a particular configuration becomes of size @xmath9 , exactly the same procedure used for discrete statistical systems @xcite , should be a good representation of the evolution of the system .",
    "this cutoff is essentially the same as that introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the present discussion can be viewed as a justification of the procedure used there at least for the calculation of the energy dependence of @xmath0 .    to also compute the dependence of the scattering amplitude upon the dipole size , and thus compare with the geometrical scaling form of the solution to bk equation",
    ", one needs to understand the fluctuations of the saturation momentum from one configuration to another . here",
    "our control is less complete , and we rely on a scaling law recently seen in numerical simulations .",
    "the scale which emerges is equal to the square root of the value found in ref .",
    "@xcite where fluctuations at the boundary were not included .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that our description is for a scattering at a definite impact parameter .",
    "a more complete discussion , including impact parameter dependences , will be given later @xcite .",
    "we consider the scattering of a dipole of variable size @xmath8 ( the probe ) off a dipole of size @xmath5 ( the target ) .",
    "a natural variable that will be used throughout is @xmath10 .",
    "we go to the rest frame of the probe so that the target carries all the available rapidity @xmath11 .",
    "the impact parameter @xmath12 between the dipoles is fixed .",
    "the target interacts through its quantum fluctuations , which at high energy are dominated by gluons .",
    "it proves useful to represent this set of partons by color dipoles @xcite .",
    "this is possible in the dilute regime in which saturation effects ( i.e. interactions among gluons inside the target wavefunction ) are negligible , but the effects of fluctuations should on the contrary be important . then , the dipole picture emerges in the large@xmath13 limit , in which gluons are similar to zero ",
    "size @xmath14 pairs and non - planar diagrams are suppressed .",
    "the dipole approximation breaks down when the amplitudes approach their unitarity limits ( indeed , in the considered frame , the unitarity corrections are tantamount to saturation effects in the target ) .",
    "however , that does not hamper getting the right asymptotics for physical quantities like the saturation scale since , as we shall see , this is controlled by the dynamics in the tail of the distribution at high transverse momenta , or small dipole sizes .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the scattering amplitude of the probe off a given partonic realization @xmath16 of the target ( the dependence on @xmath12 is understood ) .",
    "it is a random variable , whose probability distribution is related to the distribution of the different fock state realizations of the target .",
    "the values of @xmath17 range between 0 ( weak interaction ) and 1 ( unitarity limit ) .",
    "@xmath17 will be an essential intermediate quantity in our calculations , but it is not an observable . the physical dipole - dipole scattering amplitude @xmath18 is the statistical average over all partonic fluctuations of the target at rapidity @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath19 .    when @xmath20 is small , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 labels the dipoles in the fock state of the target at the time of the interaction .",
    "@xmath23 is the elementary dipole interaction and is essentially local in impact parameter .",
    "@xmath23 behaves like @xmath24 when the dipoles overlap , and vanishes otherwise ( see the insert in fig .  1 ) .",
    "we have neglected @xmath25 factors and logarithms , but these approximations do not affect the results that we shall obtain , which are largely independent of the details .",
    "( [ tel ] ) shows that the amplitude @xmath15 is simply counting the number @xmath26 of dipoles of size @xmath8 within a disk of radius @xmath8 centered at the impact parameter of the external dipole ( the dipole occupation number ) : @xmath27 note that @xmath26 can take only discrete values .",
    "thus , in this description , fluctuations in @xmath20 emerge naturally as fluctuations in the _ particle _ ( here , dipole ) _ number _ , which should be especially important in the regime where @xmath28 .",
    "the unitarity bound on @xmath20 implies that @xmath26 is also constrained by an upper bound @xmath29 .",
    "the dipole picture also provides us with the evolution law for the dipole distribution with increasing rapidity .",
    "consider a small increment @xmath30 of the total rapidity from a boost of the target .",
    "then , each of the dipoles @xmath8 already present in the wave function from the previous evolution and for which @xmath31 may split into two new dipoles , of respectives sizes @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with a differential probability@xcite @xmath34 \\times [ p(z , r\\!-\\!z|r)\\,d^2z ] \\label{splitting}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 .",
    "we see that @xmath36 is the natural evolution variable : we will call it `` time '' . the second equality in eq .",
    "( [ splitting ] ) expresses @xmath37 as the product of the inclusive probability of splitting ) .",
    "it disappears in physical quantities . ]",
    "@xmath38 in the time interval @xmath39 , by the conditional distribution of the sizes of the produced dipoles @xmath40 by applying eqs .",
    "( [ splitting])([p ] ) to any of the dipoles @xmath41 present in the wavefunction , one can easily deduce the evolution law for the dipole configuration as a whole .",
    "this leads to a description of the ( dilute tail of the ) target wavefunction as a stochastic ensemble of dipole configurations endowed with a probability distribution which evolves with @xmath11 according to a master equation @xcite .",
    "this picture , which is similar to certain problems in statistical physics , is particularly appropriate for a study of fluctuations , since the discreteness of the dipole number is explicit .",
    "however , this picture breaks down , as anticipated , when the dipole occupation numbers  which in the dilute regime rise exponentially with @xmath11  become of @xmath42 , and saturation effects start to play a role .",
    "but in this high density regime , one can rely on a different formalism , the color glass condensate @xcite , which is an effective theory for gluon correlations in the target wavefunction at small @xmath43 , and is endowed with a _ functional _ evolution equation  the jimwlk equation @xcite  which shows how these correlations change under a boost .",
    "when this formalism is applied to the scattering between the color glass ( the target ) and a set of dipoles ( the projectile ) , the saturation effects encoded in the jimwlk equation are converted into unitarity effects in the evolution of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the latter are thus found to obey an infinite hierarchy of evolution equations originally derived by balitsky @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we shall need only the first equation in this hierarchy , which applies when the projectile is a single dipole .",
    "this equation is most easily obtained by using the rapidity increment @xmath30 to accelerate the projectile ( the dipole of size @xmath8 ) . within the rapidity interval @xmath30 , either the dipole does not split , in which case its scattering amplitude @xmath44 remains unchanged , or it splits , in which case @xmath17 is replaced by the scattering amplitude of the two child dipoles .",
    "this leads to the following evolution law @xmath45 where @xmath32 is distributed according to @xmath46 . taking the limit @xmath47 and replacing @xmath48 and @xmath49 from eqs.([lambda]),([p ] ) , one gets ) .",
    "we have omitted it for simplicity and since it is enough for our purpose to assume locality of the evolution . ] @xmath50 as anticipated , eq .",
    "( [ balitsky ] ) is not a closed equation for @xmath51 : it depends upon the correlator @xmath52 .",
    "a mean field approximation @xmath53 would cast eq .",
    "( [ balitsky ] ) into a closed form , known as the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite . the linearized form of eq .",
    "( [ balitsky ] ) is recognized as the ( dipole version of ) bfkl equation @xcite .",
    "let us finally discuss the typical shape of @xmath17 as resulting from the previous considerations .",
    "it is a well known characteristic of the bfkl evolution that the most probable splittings are those in which both child dipoles have a size comparable to the size of the parent dipole ( this can be also checked on eq .",
    "( [ balitsky ] ) ) .",
    "thus , if one starts with one dipole @xmath5 at @xmath54 , then the main mechanism for the rise of @xmath17 with @xmath11 is a growing diffusion around the size of the initial dipole @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , in a typical partonic configuration as obtained after a sufficiently large rapidity evolution , the dipoles appear to be densely distributed around the size @xmath5 ( where @xmath17 is large ) , but they become more rare with decreasing @xmath8 ( or increasing @xmath55 ) , and for sufficiently large @xmath55 one meets only rare fluctuations which involve one ( or few ) dipoles and for which @xmath56 . the typical partonic realization is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : it is a front which with increasing @xmath11 progresses towards larger values of @xmath55 .",
    "we define the saturation scale @xmath0 of a given partonic configuration by the position of this front , that is , by the value of the inverse dipole size for which @xmath20 reaches some predefined number @xmath57 of order one : @xmath58 .",
    "we also define @xmath59 .",
    "when @xmath17 is of order @xmath9 , the number of dipoles participating in the scattering is small , and fluctuations dominate the dynamics of @xmath17 . by contrast ,",
    "when @xmath60 , the fluctuations @xmath61 in @xmath20 become relatively unimportant ( since typically @xmath62 ) , so the dynamics is self  averaging ( for each individual front realization ) , and the mean field description of a given event becomes justified .",
    "consequently , the evolution of @xmath20 in the bulk of the front @xmath60 is essentially given by a mean field equation ( the bk equation ) .",
    "it turns out that , for the purpose of computing the asymptotic energy dependence of the saturation momentum , one can still rely on a _ modified _ mean field approximation , which is obtained by introducing a factor @xmath63 in the bk equation .",
    "the latter implements the fact that , in a real event , in which the occupation number is discrete , @xmath20 can not become less than @xmath9 ( cf .",
    "the discussion in sec .  2 ) .",
    "to appreciate the dynamical role of this cutoff , it is useful to notice an essential difference between the tail of a real event , and that of the solution to the bk equation : whereas the front generated by the bk equation has an exponential tail which extends up to arbitrarily large @xmath55 ( see eq .",
    "( [ front ] ) below ) , a real event , on the other hand , is like a histogram whose front is necessarily compact : for any @xmath11 , there exists a _ foremost occupied bin _",
    "( f.o.b . )",
    "@xmath64 such that @xmath65 and @xmath66 for any @xmath67 .",
    "this implies that the mechanism for front propagation is different in the two cases . for the mean field approximation ,",
    "the dominant mechanism is the _ local growth _ within the tail of the distribution : at any @xmath68 , the local amplitude rises very fast due to the bfkl instability , thus  pulling \" the front towards the right .",
    "by contrast , in a real event , the local growth is not possible in the empty bins on the right of the f.o.b .",
    ", so the only way for the front to progress into those bins is via _ diffusion _ ,",
    "i.e. via radiation from the occupied bins at @xmath69 .",
    "but since diffusion is less effective than the local growth , we expect the `` velocity '' @xmath70 of the front ( i.e. , the exponential growth rate for the saturation momentum ) to be reduced in the real event as compared to the corresponding prediction of the bk equation .    a simple way to try and capture this physical situation in mathematical terms is to insert a cutoff @xmath63 on the growth term in the bk equation , while allowing the diffusion there to remain operative even at arbitrarily small @xmath20 .",
    "( this is possible after separating the local growth term from the diffusion term in the bfkl kernel with the help of a  diffusion approximation \" ; see , e.g. , @xcite for details . )",
    "this simple recipe was in fact invented by brunet and derrida @xcite in the context of statistical physics .",
    "they studied the propagation of fronts in the presence of fluctuations associated with discreteness in a variety of physical situations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . using the mean field approximation to their dynamical equations together with a suitable cutoff",
    ", they were able to compute analytically the time evolution of the position of the front and of its bulk shape .",
    "although there is so far no full mathematical justification of this procedure , it has been checked ( through numerical calculations ) that it yields indeed the right value for the velocity of the front at large times and for a large number of particles .",
    "this result is likely to be valid for all models that fall in the universality class of the stochastic fkpp equation @xcite .",
    "we expect that , also in the present qcd context , that recipe give the right asymptotics of @xmath71 for @xmath72 . indeed , when viewed in the way exposed in sec .  2",
    ", the rapidity evolution of @xmath20 is essentially the same as the time evolution of say the particle number density of a system made of a number @xmath73 of diffusing and interacting particles , and hence belongs to the class of models studied by brunet and derrida .",
    "we now turn to the practical computation of the rapidity dependence of the saturation scale . since it amounts to solving the bk equation supplemented by a cutoff , it is useful to recall first the asymptotic solutions to the bk equation without a cutoff and the way how they set in ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) . as the bk equation falls into the universality class of the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( fkpp ) equation @xcite ,",
    "its asymptotic solution is a traveling wave , i.e. a uniformly translating front whose `` position '' is characterized by the logarithm of the saturation scale @xmath74 .",
    "it moves with the `` velocity '' @xmath75 towards smaller dipole sizes .",
    "here , @xmath76 is the @xmath55moment of the dipole splitting probability  ( [ splitting ] ) , or , equivalently , the characteristic function of the bfkl kernel , and @xmath77 solves @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the front exhibits a universal tail : @xmath79 these asymptotics set in diffusively and spread over the range @xmath80 within the time interval @xmath81 this process induces corrections to the asymptotic @xmath11-dependence of the saturation scale of the form @xmath82 note that the velocity and the shape of the front for @xmath83 are completely determined by the linearized ( bfkl ) equation , and do not depend on the exact form of the nonlinearities : this is a very important consequence of the nature of the propagation of the front , which is pulled along by its tail .",
    "it implies that for a number of physical quantities , such as @xmath84 , we do not need to know the precise nonlinear mechanism that enforces unitarity of @xmath20 .",
    "this means in particular , that the dipole picture is good enough for our purpose , although it is incomplete .",
    "equation  ( [ satscal0 ] ) shows that the velocity of the front increases with @xmath11 up to its asymptotic value , which corresponds to the velocity of a front which has the shape  ( [ front ] ) all the way down to @xmath85 .",
    "however , coming back to the physical situation where , due to the discreteness of the dipole number , the real front is a histogram , we see that @xmath20 can assume the shape  ( [ front ] ) only down to @xmath86 . starting from the initial condition at @xmath54 and evolving it up to rapidity @xmath11",
    ", the amplitude first grows until it reaches the unitarity limit @xmath87 around @xmath88 .",
    "then the traveling wave front forms , and spreads from the point @xmath74 where @xmath89 down to the point @xmath55 at which @xmath90 . from eq .",
    "( [ diffusiont ] ) and from the shape of the asymptotic front eq .",
    "( [ front ] ) , the latter process occurs within the rapidity interval @xmath91 ^ 2 } { 2\\chi''(\\gamma_0 ) } \\label{time}\\ ] ] ( @xmath92 is a number of order one ) during which the velocity of the front keeps increasing according to eq .",
    "( [ satscal0 ] ) .",
    "but once the point where @xmath93 is reached , the front can not extend to even larger values of @xmath55 ( corresponding to lower values of @xmath20 ) , at variance with the pure mean field case implemented by the bk equation .",
    "accordingly , the front velocity can not increase anymore .",
    "thus the asymptotic @xmath11-dependence of the saturation scale is @xmath94 the calculation of @xmath92 requires a proper account of the exact shape of the front , and yields @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "the result  ( [ satscal ] ) is identical to the one obtained in the mean field approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effects of discreteness have been simulated by introducing a second barrier on the phase  space for bfkl evolution ( in addition to the first barrier meant to enforce saturation @xcite ) , whose role looks indeed very similar to that of our above cutoff on the value of @xmath20 . what was different , however , was the understanding of the physical role played by this barrier : in ref .",
    "@xcite , the second barrier was merely intended to impose unitarity on those evolution paths which involve a single intermediate point .",
    "but it has not been realized there that , for the evolutions leading to a final amplitude @xmath96 ( as relevant for a study of saturation ) , the constraint implied by the second barrier is actually sufficient to guarantee unitarity for _ arbitrary _ paths ( i.e. for paths with an arbitrary number of intermediate points ) . that is , the generality of eq .",
    "( [ satscal ] ) as being the correct result in the limit where @xmath97 and @xmath98 has not been recognized , nor argued , in ref .",
    "so far , we have followed the evolution of the amplitude @xmath17 corresponding to one given partonic realization @xmath16 .",
    "each such realization undergoes a stochastic evolution given by eq .",
    "( [ law ] ) . at each rapidity",

    "( [ satscal ] ) . however , since the actual evolution is stochastic , the saturation scale @xmath84 undergoes a random walk about its mean @xmath99 , and @xmath84 gets a variance @xmath100 .",
    "physically , the origin of this phenomenon can be traced to the statistical fluctuations in the tail @xmath90 of the amplitude : in the course of the evolution , an unusually large number of dipoles may be created , which , after further rapidity evolution , would `` pull '' the whole front ahead of its typical evolution , resulting in a saturation scale @xmath84 for this particular realization larger than the mean @xmath99 .",
    "this mechanism leads to a spread of the saturation scales of different partonic realizations , while the shape of @xmath20 in its bulk remains identical .",
    "in particular , the velocity of the average front @xmath101 is still given by eq .",
    "( [ satscal ] ) ( at least , for sufficiently large @xmath11 ; see below ) , because this is the ( asymptotic ) velocity of all the individual fronts making up the statistical ensemble .",

    "in order to perform this average , the expression for the variance @xmath100 of the saturation scale is needed .",

    "this feature is a direct consequence of the statistical nature of the parton model : the statistical fluctuations of the number of dipoles translate into a random wandering of the saturation scale , and after averaging over partonic realizations , the scaling form  ( [ scaling ] ) results .    the violation of geometric scaling manifest in eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) was already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the square root in the denominator of the scaling variable was missing because of a lack of fluctuations in the tail of the distribution : the approach used there was relying on mean field throughout , missing the stochastic nature of the evolution .",

    "we have also derived the scaling form of the asymptotic dipole - dipole scattering amplitude ( [ scaling ] ) , which is related to the dispersion of saturation scales between different `` events '' ( corresponding to different partonic realizations ) . that scaling is clearly not geometric .",
    "a recurrent theme in this letter has been universality that guarantees that the lowest order results do not depend on the details of the model .",
    "the exact way how saturation comes about was not an issue , as well the details of the elementary dipole interaction do not enter the leading order results ( in @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) that we have obtained here .",
    "further terms in these expansions will be model dependent , and thus much more difficult to get .",
    "one of the points that remain to be studied is how fast the computed asymptotics set in .",
    "the bk equation may still be a good approximation for a large target ( like a nucleus ) and in the first stages of the evolution , when the traveling wave front has not diffused down to @xmath90 .",
    "more precise numerical studies @xcite may help to clarify this point .    finally , as mentioned in the introduction , the dependence upon the impact parameter plays an important role for the overall physical picture of unitarization .",
