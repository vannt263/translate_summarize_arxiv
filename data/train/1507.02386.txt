    "the large @xmath0 limit with fixed t  hooft coupling @xmath16 of non - abelian gauge theories has been the subject of intensive research for more than four decades , and in particular has fostered the study of large @xmath0 matrix field theories .",
    "random matrix models are a simplified version of these theories that offer a convenient setting to explore large @xmath0 limits , because the partition function of a @xmath17 random matrix model can be written as an integral over the matrix eigenvalues @xmath18 : @xmath19    the standard large @xmath0 limit is defined here as @xmath20 with fixed t  hooft coupling @xmath21 .",
    "this limit exhibits a number of interesting properties in the case of hermitian matrix models with polynomial potentials @xmath22 , such as the existence of an asymptotic eigenvalue density supported on a finite number of real intervals ( cuts ) , and the existence of a topological expansion of the free energy in the one - cut case  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss this large @xmath0 limit and generalizations thereof for the penner matrix model with potential @xmath23 the logarithmic function in  ( [ pee ] ) is defined by @xmath24 with @xmath25 and where @xmath26 denotes the real logarithmic function on the positive real axis .",
    "we consider the penner model on any path @xmath27 in  ( [ mm ] ) homotopic in @xmath28 to the steepest descent path @xmath29 through the critical point @xmath30 of @xmath22 illustrated in  fig .",
    "[ fig : path ] .",
    "obviously , the corresponding partition function  ( [ mm ] ) can not be interpreted as an integral over the ( real ) eigenvalues of a hermitian matrix model , but to a model in which the integration is performed over a set of @xmath17 complex matrices with @xmath0 eigenvalues constrained to lie on the path @xmath27 . in the literature  @xcite these models",
    "are frequently called _ holomorphic _ matrix models . however , to emphasize the relation of  ( [ mm ] ) to the theory of non - hermitian laguerre orthogonal polynomials , hereafter we call our model the non - hermitian penner model .    ,",
    "width=302 ]    the hermitian penner model was introduced in  @xcite because the large @xmath0 expansion of its free energy provided generating functionals for the euler characteristics @xmath31 of the moduli spaces of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath32 with @xmath33 punctures .",
    "it was found later  @xcite that the analytic continuation of the free energy in the hermitian case to the non - hermitian case and a suitable double scaling limit yielded a generating functional for the euler characteristics of unpunctured riemann surfaces too . as a consequence ,",
    "the penner model is closely related to the @xmath34 noncritical string with one direction of the spacetime compactified on the circle with self - dual radius  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the model has been used to analyze nonperturbative effects in @xmath34 string theory and matrix models  @xcite .    in the early 90 s tan  @xcite , and ambjrn , kristjansen and makeenko",
    "@xcite applied the saddle point method to give what was thought to be a complete description of the large @xmath0 limit of the penner model for both positive and negative fixed values of the t  hooft coupling .",
    "the present paper is motivated by the behavior of the asymptotic zero distribution of the laguerre polynomials with negative parameter discovered by kuijlaars and mclaughlin  @xcite .",
    "note that fixing the t  hooft coupling @xmath3 in effect defines a sequence @xmath35 which trivially satisfies @xmath36 we will show that the behavior discovered by kuijlaars and mclaughlin  @xcite also arises in the large @xmath0 limit of the non - hermitian penner model if the sequence @xmath37 is not restricted to be  ( [ eq : thgn ] ) , but only required to have the limit  ( [ ll ] ) with @xmath4 and to have a finite value @xmath6 for the following limit : @xmath38    under these conditions there indeed exists a large @xmath0 limit , but this limit depends not only on @xmath3 but also on the parameter @xmath6 , introduced by kuijlaars and mclaughlin in  @xcite . as a consequence , we will also show that the standard large @xmath0 limit defined by the sequence  ( [ eq : thgn ] ) with @xmath4 does not exist , i.e , in this limit there is not an asymptotic eigenvalue density with a well - defined support , nor a planar limit of the free energy .",
    "we begin our analysis by using the saddle point method  @xcite to establish the connection between the asymptotic eigenvalue density of the penner model and the asymptotic zero density of the laguerre polynomials .",
    "more concretely , we prove that given a sequence of coupling constants @xmath37 , the components of the ( multiple ) saddle points of the integrand of  ( [ mm ] ) are the zeros of the scaled laguerre polynomials @xmath39 .",
    "therefore we can apply the results of  @xcite , from which the following picture emerges : if @xmath4 and the limit @xmath6 exists , then there exists an asymptotic eigenvalue density @xmath40 , and its support @xmath41 consists of two pieces : an interval @xmath42 $ ] on the positive real axis and an @xmath6-dependent closed loop @xmath43 around the origin .",
    "these pieces are disjoint for @xmath44 . if @xmath12 the loop reduces to the origin , where the asymptotic eigenvalue density has a dirac @xmath45 contribution .",
    "in the electrostatic interpretation the eigenvalue density @xmath40 represents a unit - normalized positive charge density on @xmath41 in the presence of an external electrostatic potential @xmath46 given by @xmath47 and such that the total potential @xmath48 is constant on each piece of @xmath41 .",
    "we calculate explicitly these constants , which turn out to be different for @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the density @xmath40 for @xmath44 is not an equilibrium density , but a critical density in the sense of martnez - finkelshtein and rakhmanov  @xcite .",
    "we also show that the total electrostatic energy @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 note that @xmath13 is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "we then apply the method of orthogonal polynomials  @xcite to derive an explicit expression of the partition function  ( [ mm ] ) of the non - hermitian penner model in terms of the barnes @xmath51 function , and then calculate the planar limit of the free energy as @xmath52 the main result here is that if @xmath4 and the limit @xmath6 exists , then @xmath53 which involves an @xmath6-dependent term .",
    "this proves that the @xmath6 dependence of the large @xmath0 limit also manifests itself in the planar limit of the free energy .",
    "we illustrate this phenomenon with numerical calculations .",
    "finally , by comparing  ( [ e0 ] ) and  ( [ llz0 ] ) it follows that the difference between the free energy and the total energy can be written as @xmath54}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 } = \\int_a^b \\rho(z ) |{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}z| = 1 - \\frac{1}{t}\\ ] ] is the amount of charge on the interval @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "this is a somewhat unexpected feature of the non - hermitian penner model : for hermitian matrix models with real analytic potentials @xmath56 that grow faster than @xmath57 at infinity it is well known  @xcite that in the large @xmath0 limit @xmath58    we also study in detail the expansion of the free energy beyond the planar limit for the simple sequence @xmath59 , derive a suitable double scaling expansion at the critical value @xmath60 , and show that this latter expansion provides generating functions for the euler characteristics of both unpunctured and punctured riemann surfaces .    in the last section of the paper we point out some extensions of its main results .",
    "the technical details of the explicit computation of the total potential on the support of the eigenvalue density are relegated to an appendix .",
    "in this section we use the saddle - point method to derive the schwinger - dyson equation , which is the main tool to determine the asymptotic eigenvalue density @xmath40 , and then discuss the concepts of equilibrium and critical densities .",
    "the arguments are valid not only for the penner model  ( [ pee ] ) , but for any matrix model  ( [ mm ] ) such that @xmath61 is a rational function of @xmath62 whose only singularities are at most a set of simple poles @xmath63 .",
    "we assume that @xmath27 is a path in the analyticity domain of @xmath22 such that the integral  ( [ mm ] ) is convergent .",
    "the penner model  ( [ pee ] ) corresponds to a case in which @xmath64 .",
    "we can write the partition function  ( [ mm ] ) as @xmath65 where @xmath66    the saddle points @xmath67 of @xmath68 are the solutions of the equations @xmath69 since these equations are symmetric under permutations of the coordinates @xmath18 , generically each solution @xmath67 of  ( [ sa ] ) gives rise to a set of @xmath70 solutions @xmath71 , where @xmath72 denote the permutations of @xmath0 objects .",
    "the saddle point method assumes that there exists a sequence of saddle points @xmath73 of @xmath68 and a unit - normalized positive density @xmath40 ( the eigenvalue density ) with support @xmath74 such that @xmath75 in the large @xmath0 limit ( [ ll ] ) .",
    "each saddle point of the sequence @xmath76 determines a monic polynomial which we denote by @xmath77 and , as a consequence of  ( [ sa ] ) , the resolvent function @xmath78 satisfies the ricatti equation @xmath79 this equation coincides with the ricatti equation  ( 2.6 ) derived in  @xcite after performing the notational replacements @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit @xmath83 of the resolvent @xmath84 defined in  ( [ re ] ) is @xmath85 therefore , as a consequence of  ( [ ri ] ) , the function @xmath83 must satisfy the schwinger - dyson equation @xmath86 for later reference , we also show the reduction to a second order linear equation for @xmath87 of the ricatti equation  ( [ ri ] ) : @xmath88      in this section we discuss briefly the minimum technical background that permits us to differentiate between the equilibrium density ( i.e , the absolute minimum ) and critical densities in the sense of martnez - finkelshtein and rakhmanov  @xcite . in this context , it is convenient to introduce the function @xmath89 and rewrite the schwinger - dyson equation  ( [ rl ] ) as @xmath90 where @xmath91 incidentally , the density @xmath40 can be recovered from @xmath92 using the sokhotskii - plemelj formulas . moreover , under our assumptions on @xmath61 the function @xmath93 defined in  ( [ ere0 ] ) is a rational function of @xmath62 with the same poles as @xmath61 .",
    "hence , from  ( [ lai0 ] ) it follows that the function @xmath92 is analytic outside @xmath94 , and  ( [ lay ] ) implies @xmath95    equation  ( [ lay ] ) is crucial to derive the main features of the eigenvalue density .",
    "thus , we note that the function @xmath83 coincides with the cauchy transform @xmath96 of the measure on @xmath97 , with support @xmath74 , given by @xmath98 hence  ( [ lay ] ) can be written as @xmath99 this relation shows that @xmath100 is a continuous critical measure on @xmath97 in the sense of martnez - finkelshtein and rakhmanov  @xcite . as a consequence ( see lemma  5.2 of  @xcite and proposition  3.8 of  @xcite ) , the support @xmath74 of @xmath40 is a union of a finite number of analytic arcs @xmath101 which are maximal trajectories of the quadratic differential @xmath102 i.e. , maximal curves  @xcite @xmath103 such that @xmath104 moreover  @xcite , the total potential @xmath105 is locally constant on @xmath74 @xmath106 with possibly different constants @xmath107 , and that it satisfies @xmath108 where @xmath109 denote the two normal vectors to @xmath74 at @xmath62 pointing in the opposite directions . equation  ( [ s0 ] ) is the so - called @xmath110-property of stahl  @xcite and of gonchar and rakhmanov  @xcite , whose electrostatic interpretation is that the electric fields at either side of @xmath74 are opposite or , equivalently , that the forces acting on each element of charge at @xmath62 from the two sides of @xmath74 are equal .",
    "the total electrostatic energy  ( [ efe ] ) can be written in terms of the external potential and the constants @xmath107 as @xmath111    we emphasize that unless all the constants @xmath107 are equal , the eigenvalue density is not an equilibrium density minimizing the total energy  ( [ efe ] ) .",
    "in fact , continuous critical measures are characterized by a different stationary condition for the total energy , @xmath112 = \\lim_{s\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\mathcal{e}[\\rho^s]-\\mathcal{e}[\\rho]}{s}=0,\\ ] ] under variations @xmath113 , with @xmath114 , induced by local set transformations @xmath115 induced by smooth functions @xmath116 .    summing up ,",
    "in general the eigenvalue densities arising from the saddle point method determine continuous critical measures on @xmath97 , and we will refer to them as critical densities .",
    "in this section we specialize the general equations obtained in the previous section to the penner model  ( [ pee ] ) and show its relation to the theory of laguerre polynomials  @xcite @xmath117    indeed , the saddle point equations  ( [ sa ] ) for the penner model are @xmath118 and the corresponding ricatti equation  ( [ ri ] ) is @xmath119 from  ( [ sa0 ] ) it follows that @xmath120 and we get the following second order linear equation  ( [ ri1 ] ) for @xmath87 : @xmath121 by comparing  ( [ ri1b ] ) with the laguerre differential equation @xmath122 we find that the monic polynomials @xmath87 are proportional to the rescaled laguerre polynomials @xmath123 therefore , the saddle points @xmath73 of the penner model with coupling constants @xmath37 are given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 are the zeros of @xmath126 .      riemann - hilbert and steepest - descent methods  @xcite have permitted the complete characterization of the asymptotic zero distribution @xmath127 of the scaled laguerre polynomials @xmath128 for all real values of the parameter @xmath129    we will concentrate on the case @xmath130 .",
    "it turns out that the zeros cluster along certain curves @xmath74 , but the form of @xmath74 depends not only on the value of @xmath131 but also on the parameter @xmath132^{1/n},\\ ] ] which represents the proximity degree of the sequence @xmath133 to the integers .",
    "thus , if the limit @xmath6 exists and we denote @xmath134 then ( see theorem  1.2 and eq .  ( 3.14 ) of  @xcite ) it follows that ( @xmath135}(x)$ ] equals 1 if @xmath136 $ ] and zero otherwise ) :    1 .   for @xmath12 @xmath137,\\ ] ] and @xmath138}(x ) { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}x.\\ ] ] 2 .   for @xmath139 @xmath140,\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is a simple closed curve encircling @xmath142 clockwise , which is determined by the implicit equation @xmath143 furthermore @xmath144}(x ) { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath145 and the branch of the squared root is such that @xmath146 as @xmath147 .",

    "we remark that this fine structure of the asymptotic zero distribution of the laguerre polynomials does not arise for other values of the limit  ( [ clag ] ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath151 the support of the zero distribution is a well - defined simple analytic curve symmetric with respect to the real axis  @xcite .      in view of  ( [ rel0 ] ) and  ( [ sopl ] ) , by setting @xmath152",
    "we can apply immediately the results on the asymptotic zero distribution of laguerre polynomials into properties for the asymptotic eigenvalue density of the penner model .",

    "we have seen that if @xmath4 and the limit @xmath6 exists , then the asymptotic eigenvalue density of the penner model exists but depends not only on the value of the parameter @xmath3 but also on the value of @xmath6 .",

    ". therefore there are subsequences of @xmath188 with @xmath12 and subsequences with @xmath11 . likewise ,",
    "if @xmath3 is irrational then the sequence @xmath189 is a dense subset of the interval @xmath190 $ ] .",
    "hence @xmath188 has subsequences with @xmath12 and subsequences with @xmath11 .",

    "hence for real values of @xmath193 such that @xmath194 the sequence @xmath37 yields the value @xmath11 .    unfortunately , the example  ( [ e02 ] ) does not work for @xmath3 irrational .",

    "multi - penner models of the form @xmath315 are relevant to characterize the correlation functions of the @xmath316 conformal @xmath317 toda field theory  @xcite . therefore , it is interesting to investigate their large @xmath0 limits  @xcite .",
