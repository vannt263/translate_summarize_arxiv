    "the present work is an extension of our previous one @xcite on the investigation of unitarity effects in small-@xmath1 processes .",
    "it was found experimentally at hera that both the total cross section of a highly virtual photon , @xmath3 , and the cross section for its diffractive dissociation have a fast increase with energy .",
    "this is related to a fast increase of densities of quarks and gluons as the bjorken variable @xmath1 decreases .",
    "the dynamics of such very dense partonic systems is very interesting and has been studied by many authors both in deep inelastic scattering ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for reviews and ref .",
    "@xcite for some recent papers ) and in high energy nuclear interactions @xcite .",
    "unitarity effects should stop the increase of densities at extremely small @xmath1 and lead to a `` saturation '' of parton densities .",
    "it is important to determine the region of @xmath1 and @xmath4 where the effects of saturation become important .",
    "we study this problem using reggeon calculus @xcite with a supercritical pomeron ( @xmath5 ) and the partonic picture of @xmath0-interaction in qcd . in our previous paper @xcite we used this approach for the description of hera data in the region @xmath6 @xmath7 , where the effects of unitarity are most important .",
    "it was shown that , with a single pomeron of intercept 1.2 and multipomeron exchanges ( unitarity effects ) , it is possible to obtain a self - consistent , simultaneous , description of both the total @xmath0-cross section and diffractive production in high - energy @xmath0-interactions . in such approach , it is convenient to consider the process of @xmath0-interaction in the laboratory frame as an interaction of the @xmath2-pair , produced by the photon , with the proton .",
    "we separated the @xmath2-pair fluctuation into two components , `` aligned '' component with a strongly asymmetric sharing of the momentum fraction @xmath8 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and the rest ( `` symmetric '' ) component .",
    "such a separation is important at large @xmath4 , where the first component has a large transverse size , while the `` symmetric '' component has a size @xmath11 and thus has a small cross section @xmath12 of interaction with the target .",
    "both components give a contribution to the @xmath3 which behaves as @xmath13 at large @xmath4 , but the `` aligned '' component gives the main contribution to the diffraction production cross section .",
    "triple pomeron diagrams were also included in our model .    in this paper",
    "we propose a more direct separation of the two components of the @xmath2-pair , which is valid also for small @xmath4 . the separation into a small size ( @xmath14 ) and a large size ( @xmath15 ) components of the @xmath2 pair is now made in terms of the transverse distance @xmath16 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the border value , @xmath17 , is treated as a free parameter - which turn out to be @xmath18  fm .",

    "let s forget for the moment about the triple pomeron contribution , i.e. consider the case @xmath46=0 .",
