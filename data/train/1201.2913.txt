    "@xcite was the first to discover a tight correlation ( hereafter the `` phillips method '' ) between optical absolute magnitudes at maximum light and the decline - rate parameter @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) , defined as the drop in @xmath1-band brightness from peak to 15 days later .",

    "decreases the dispersion in measured distance estimates to the 0.20 mag level or less ( @xcite ) , which significantly improves the accuracy of sne  ia as standardizable candles at optical wavelengths .",
    "sne  ia have played a critical role in cosmological studies over the past two decades .",
    "while the majority of sne  ia studies have been performed using optical bands , there has long been the hope that they might actually have greater accuracy in nir bands , due to the reduced effects of dust extinction , which is one of the main sources of error in distance determinations ( @xcite ) .",
    "this has motivated recent work on establishing the standardizability of sne  ia in the nir , which has been shown to be advantageous for several reasons .",
    "extinction corrections are smaller , on the order of a magnitude less , in nir than in optical bands ( @xcite ) , and there appears to be a shallower dependence of absolute nir magnitude on decline - rate compared with optical bands ( krisciunas et al .",
    "2004a , c ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have found that the absolute magnitudes of sne  ia depend on host - galaxy properties ( i.e. , star formation rate , host - galaxy mass , host - galaxy metallicity ) , making the correction factors evolve with redshift . therefore , minimizing these correction factors by observing in the nir is important , not only to decrease the random errors incurred for each sn  ia s correction , but also to reduce our sensitivity to any systematic evolution of the correction factors with redshift .    the first nir observation of a sn  ia was reported by @xcite , and the first extensive nir data set was obtained by elias et al . ( 1981 , 1985 ) .",
    "since that time , there has been a large increase in the number of sne  ia light - curves observed at nir wavelengths , especially within the last decade ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; krisciunas et al .",
    "2004a , b , c , 2006 ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "two groups , in particular , have been working to obtain homogenous optical and nir data sets of sne of all types in multiple filters : the cfa supernova group ( @xcite ) and the _ carnegie supernova project _ ( csp ; @xcite ) .",
    "initial studies suggested that sne  ia may present a weaker peak luminosity vs. decline - rate dependence in the nir compared with the optical , which display slopes of 0.63 , 0.61 , 0.57 , and 0.52 mag unit@xmath12 decline - rate [ as measured by @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) ] in @xmath13 , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "this led some early investigators ( e.g. , @xcite ) to suggest that these objects may be nearly perfect standard candles in the nir .",
    "krisciunas et al .",
    "( 2004a , c ) confirmed these suggestions , finding no obvious decline - rate relations in the @xmath14 bands , concluding that sne  ia might well be nearly perfect standard candles in the nir at the @xmath15 0.20 mag level or better . a study by @xcite , which did not correct for optical light - curve shape , found sne  ia to be excellent standard candles in the nir , deriving an intrinsic dispersion in absolute magnitude of only 0.28 mag in the @xmath7-band and 0.15 mag in the @xmath8-band .",
    "@xcite found a marginal dependence of absolute nir magnitudes on decline - rate using csp sne ia ( 0.44 @xmath15 0.14 , 0.58 @xmath15 0.09 , 0.33 @xmath15 0.18 mag unit@xmath12 decline - rate in @xmath0 , respectively ) .",
    "some of these earlier studies , however , employ inhomogeneous samples of sne  ia ( e.g. , different telescopes , different reduction procedures ) , so subtle systematics may complicate interpretation of the results .    in this article",
    "we re - examine the standardizability of sne  ia in the nir bands using a homogeneously obtained sample of 27 low - redshift objects observed by the csp between 2004 and 2007 .",
    "we use these data to quantitatively examine whether a decline - rate dependence correction is needed in the nir or whether sne  ia are indeed perfect standard candles at these wavelengths . a detailed description of the csp observations , data reduction , and photometry processes can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of the photometric data are on the swope+csp natural photometric system , with the final sn photometry published by @xcite , with the exception of three sne  ia ( sne  2006et ,  2007af , and  2007on ) whose photometry are presented in the second csp data release article ( @xcite ) .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in",
    "we briefly discuss light - curve template - fitting using snoopy ( supernova in object - oriented python ; @xcite ) , and we point out difficulties with the template - fitting approach . in",
    "we examine the standardizability of sne  ia in nir bands by examining the efficacy of the phillips method to fit the relationship between absolute peak @xmath16 magnitudes and decline - rates . in",
    "we investigate the bimodal distribution of the fast - declining , low - luminosity sne at these wavelengths .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in .",
    "from 20042007 , the csp obtained @xmath17 sn  ia light - curves in both optical and nir bands . here , we choose 27 of the best - observed objects discovered during the first three campaigns , all of which have optical observations that start before maximum light and continue for at least 30 days post - maximum .",
    "thirteen of the sne  ia have nir observations that begin before maximum brightness as well , while the others begin shortly after maximum brightness .",
    "we denote a best - fit ( bf ) subsample as those 13 objects with observed maxima in both optical and nir bands .",
    "this bf subsample is used to create a `` training set '' for the template light - curves following the process described here .",
    "sn  ia light - curve parameters are typically measured with respect to the peak of the light - curve .",
    "we prefer to directly measure the @xmath18-corrected , de - reddened time of maximum ( @xmath19@xmath20 ) , peak magnitude ( @xmath3@xmath20 ) , and decline - rate [ @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) ] based on a cubic - spline interpolation of the data points themselves ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , in @xmath21 , sne  ia typically achieve peak brightness 34 days prior to @xmath1-band maximum , which often results in having objects with well - observed optical peaks but nir observations that begin post - peak . although not optimal , peak values ( i.e. , @xmath19@xmath20 and @xmath3@xmath20 ) can be estimated for such objects by fitting their post - peak data with a template light - curve based on observations of sne  ia with well - observed optical and nir peaks .",
    "to generate and fit our templates , we employ the snoopy package ( @xcite ) . to create the training set using the best - observed objects",
    ", snoopy examines the @xmath1-band light - curves and computes where the derivative is zero on the cubic - spline fit .",
    "this point is used to estimate @xmath19@xmath20 and @xmath3@xmath20 ( and their uncertainties ) .",
    "once @xmath19@xmath22 is found , snoopy measures @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) and then @xmath3@xmath23 in all of the other filters .",
    "this training set of sne  ia is then used to create the template @xmath24 light - curves through the procedure detailed by @xcite .",
    "briefly , @xmath19@xmath23 , @xmath3@xmath23 , and @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) of the training set are placed on a three - dimensional surface for each band .",
    "snoopy interpolates across the surface along a constant @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) line using a 2d variation of the gloess algorithm ( @xcite ) . from the template light - curves , snoopy then measures the best - fit values of @xmath19@xmath23 , @xmath3@xmath23 , and @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 , which is the template - derived value of the decline - rate derived from a combination of all filters , via @xmath25@xmath26 minimization . for consistency , we use @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) , which is the decline - rate directly measured from the @xmath1-band , as the decline - rate parameter for all of our objects in all filters , including those objects that were template fit .",
    "the measured @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) parameters for all sne are listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .      unlike optical light - curves , which are quite homogeneous for a fixed @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 )",
    ", light - curves at longer wavelengths display a more diverse morphology , particularly due to the existence of a rise to a `` second maximum '' following the initial peak .",
    "investigation in the @xmath27-band has shown that this second peak can exhibit a strength and morphology that varies significantly from sn  ia to sn  ia with identical @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) values ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we confirm this with our sample in @xmath0 ( see figs . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] ) . note the similarity in the @xmath1 and @xmath28 light - curves in figures [ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig2 ] and the difference in the @xmath0 light - curves , especially around the second maximum .",
    "this creates a problem for template fitting nir light - curves using a one - parameter descriptor of light - curve shape , especially for fast - declining sne ia [ i.e. , @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) @xmath10 1.7 ] .    to test",
    "the accuracy of light - curve parameters derived from template fits , we compare the peak @xmath0 magnitudes obtained from template fits with those obtained directly from spline fits for the bf group [ excluding sne with @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) @xmath10 1.7 ] in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the weighted averages of the difference in peak magnitude for @xmath0 are 0.02 mag , 0.02 mag , and 0.05 mag , respectively , for objects with @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) @xmath29 1.7 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows evidence of systematic differences , particularly in @xmath8 , but the systematic errors are not large compared with the uncertainties in the final absolute magnitudes due to the errors in the host color excess and the derived distances .",
    "@xcite also found evidence of systematic differences in peak magnitudes derived from template vs. spline fits for the nir filters , as shown in their figure 5 , stating that the poor precision of the template fit in @xmath30 is partly due to the small sample used to derive the templates and also due to the variation in morphology surrounding the second maximum .",
    "@xcite used a bootstrap technique to incorporate the extra dispersion found in the template fits caused by nir light - curve variations .",
    "we have attempted to account for this extra dispersion by adding the extrapolation errors derived by @xcite in quadrature with the uncertainties in the apparent magnitude obtained from the snoopy fits .    because the variations in the strength of the secondary maximum affect the accuracy of light - curve template fitting in the @xmath30 bands",
    ", we might expect the uncertainties in the peak nir magnitudes to be a function of how many days past maximum the observations begin .",
    "@xcite found that if a sne  ia has observations that begin within @xmath311 week after the time of maximum , the random uncertainty in peak magnitude is @xmath310.1 mag and the systematic uncertainty is only @xmath310.03 mag ; a template fit for a sne  ia with photometry that starts later than this will be unreliable .",
    "two thirds of the events in our sample with @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) @xmath29 1.7 have photometry that starts within 5 days of the nir maximum , and so it is interesting to see if the template fitting procedure gives reasonable estimates of the peak magnitude for these sne  ia . to test this",
    ", we create a plot similar to that of figure [ fig : fig3 ] . for this test",
    ", we re - derive the template fit peak nir apparent magnitudes by removing all of the data prior to 5 days after nir maximum for each sn  ia and running the data through snoopy again .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the resulting plots in @xmath0 .",
    "there appear to be some systematic differences , but , again , they are not large when compared wih the uncertainties in the final absolute magnitudes . the weighted averages of the differences are 0.03 mag in @xmath6 , 0.01 mag in @xmath7 , and 0.04 mag in @xmath8 , which is about the same for the weighted averages found in figure [ fig : fig3 ] , suggesting that when the observations begin within 5 days of nir maximum , snoopy does an adequate job of deriving peak light - curve parameters from template fits .    it is unclear at this point how to best handle the diversity of light - curve morphologies in the nir when applying templates to sne  ia whose nir observations start more than 5 days after nir maxima . introducing a second parameter , such as another peak magnitude , decline - rate relation ( such as a @xmath2m@xmath4-like parameter defined for the @xmath0 bandpasses ) , host - galaxy property , or spectral feature ,",
    "might help ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ) , but identifying this second parameter is difficult with the limited number of well - observed events . with significant differences among the nir light - curves of sne  ia with similar @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 )",
    "values , though , template fitting in @xmath30 based on the @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4(@xmath1 ) parameter alone may be subject to significant uncertainties . here , we proceed to cautiously apply templates when needed , while using the bf subsample of objects , for which no template - fitting is needed , to check our results .",

    "for all five subsamples , the slopes are rather insensitive to the exact value of @xmath63@xmath61 .      using the distance modulus derived from equation ( 1 ) and the cmb redshifts taken from nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , we construct a hubble diagram , which is plotted in figure [ fig : fig10 ] .",
    "we use sne and fit parameters from subsample 2 to derive the distance modulus for each sn in @xmath0 and @xmath1-bands [ m@xmath71(0 ) = @xmath6219.222(005 ) , b@xmath71= 1.042(213 ) ] .",
    "the distance moduli for the three nir bands are averaged for each object .",
    "the resulting hubble diagram for the combined nir bands and @xmath1-band is shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : fig10 ] .",
    "the solid line represents the adopted concordance model of equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the residuals between the corrected distance modulus and the standard cosmology are shown in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : fig10 ] .",
    "we find a combined rms scatter of 0.13 mag , or 6% in distance , for the nir bands and a rms scatter of 0.22 mag , or 11% in distance , for the @xmath1-band .",
    "the decrease in scatter from optical bands to nir bands on the hubble diagram provides strong evidence that sne  ia in nir bands are excellent standard candles .",
    "note that the dispersion of 0.13 mag obtained in the nir includes the effects of peculiar velocities .",
    "this was demonstrated by @xcite , who pointed out that the residuals in the hubble diagram in separate filters are highly correlated .",
    "peculiar velocities also explain why the dispersion in figure [ fig : fig10 ] decreases with redshift .",
    "hence , the true precision of sne  ia as distance indicators in the nir is almost certainly better than 6% .",
    "figures [ fig : fig5 ] and [ fig : fig8 ] indicate a range of peak luminosities for the fast - declining sne  ia .",
    "@xcite suggest that , instead of a range of peak brightnesses , there is a bimodal distribution of peak absolute nir magnitudes for the fast - declining objects ; those with nir maximum occurring after the time of @xmath1-band maximum ( @xmath19@xmath22 ) are subluminous and those with nir maximum occurring prior to @xmath19@xmath22 have standard brightnesses compared with  normal \" sne  ia .",
    "our data are consistent with this bimodal distribution hypothesis .",
    "our sample has three fast - declining sne  ia : sn  2005ke ( @xmath2@xmath68@xmath4(@xmath1 ) = 1.75 ) , sn  2006mr ( @xmath2@xmath68@xmath4(@xmath1)=1.81 ) , and sn  2007on ( @xmath2@xmath68@xmath4(@xmath1)=1.89 ) .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : tab7 ] , sne  2005ke and 2006mr have an average nir maxima that occurs @xmath312 - 4 days after @xmath19@xmath22 and are , on average , 0.89 mag fainter in @xmath65@xmath72 , 0.98 mag fainter in @xmath65@xmath73 , and 0.63 mag fainter in @xmath65@xmath74 than the average peak luminosity of the slow to midrange - decliners , respectively , whereas sn  2007on has nir maximum that occurs @xmath312 days prior to @xmath19@xmath22 and has standard peak absolute brightness in all three nir bands .",
    "it is not surprising that this same bimodality in the absolute magnitude found by @xcite is also found in our sample seeing , as our sample contains some of the same objects that were used in the @xcite study .",
    "it was also found by @xcite that fast - decliners with standard brightnesses , such as sn  2007on , show a distinct secondary maxima in the nir , much like slow - declining objects , whereas the subluminous fast - decliners have monotonically declining light - curves in all bands .",
    "our three fast - declining objects show this trend ( see figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "we re - examine the peak absolute magnitude vs. decline - rate relationship , excluding the two subluminous fast - decliners and including the standard fast - decliner .",
    "subsamples 2 and 5 described in @xmath673.2 are used for this analysis , sne  2005ke and 2006mr are omitted and sn  2007on is included for each subsample .",
    "the fit parameters derived are given in table  [ tab : tab8 ] .",
    "including sn  2007on and excluding the two subluminous fast - decliners creates no significant change in slopes for the three nir bands in subsamples 2 and 5 , with the significance on the measured slopes remaining the same .",
    "the only case where the fiducial absolute peak magnitude significantly changes when sn  2007on is included is for the @xmath7-band in subsample 2 .",
    "the absolute peak magnitudes for the other bands in subsamples 2 and 5 change very little .",
    "our findings here confirm the @xcite results that sne  ia with nir maximum occurring prior to @xmath1-band maximum , such as sn  2007on , have absolute peak magnitudes that are consistent with the absolute peak magnitudes of slow- to mid - decliners , allowing these sne  ia to be used for the peak absolute magnitude vs. decline - rate relationship analysis .",
    "we analyze 27 of the best - observed sne  ia from the first 4 years of the csp .",
    "spline curves were fit to the 13 objects with observed maxima in @xmath0 .",
    "a  training set \" was created from these 13 sne  ia to construct light - curve templates for the other 14 objects with no observed nir maxima .",
    "light - curve properties obtained from these fits were used to calculate peak absolute magnitude , and correlations were sought with @xmath1-band decline - rates .",
    "we discuss difficulties encountered when fitting templates to the nir light - curves , due to the variations in the strength of the secondary maximum at a given decline - rate .",
    "the problems are especially pronounced for fast - decliners ; however , if the observations begin within 5 days after nir maximum , snoopy provides peak magnitudes with an accuracy of @xmath310.04 mag .",
    "obtaining additional sne  ia light - curves with observed nir maxima would be ideal , since splines can be directly fit , but this poses an observational challenge , since nir maximum typically occurs several days earlier than it does in optical bands . finding a second light - curve parameter [ i.e. , other than @xmath2m@xmath4(b ) ] could certainly be beneficial when fitting nir light - curve templates to data ; our limited sample size , however , makes such an investigation problematic . future larger samples of sne ia observed in the nir could possibly provide evidence for this second parameter and increase the accuracy of fitting templates to nir light - curves , regardless of when the observations begin .    from our original sample of 27 objects ,",
    "we examine whether a `` phillips relation '' exists for the observed data that improves the standardizability of sne  ia in the nir for five different subsamples .",
    "@xmath63@xmath61 was kept fixed at 3.1 , although the results are shown to not change appreciably if lower values are used .",
    "consistent with earlier findings , we find that any peak luminosity vs. decline - rate dependence does indeed decrease in the nir compared with the optical , confirming that sne  ia are better  standard candles \" at longer wavelengths .",
    "when fast - decliners and highly reddened events are removed from the sample ( e.g. , subsample 2 ) , a weaker dependence of absolute peak magnitude on decline - rate is found , with the significance of the measured slope being 1.5@xmath5 for the @xmath6-band and 3@xmath5 for the @xmath7- and @xmath8-bands .",
    "the fact that the rms dispersion decreases significantly when the fast - declining sne  ia are removed confirms the finding by krisciunas et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that a simple linear relationship can not be used to fit both the slow- to midrange - decliners and the fast - decliners . for subsample 3 , which uses sne",
    "ia whose first observations begin within 5 days after nir maxima , we find a weak ( 1.7@xmath5 ) dependence of @xmath6 peak luminosity on decline - rate and a stronger ( 2.8@xmath5 ) dependence of @xmath7- and @xmath8-peak luminosities on decline - rate .",
    "the dispersion decreases significantly for subsample 3 , compared with subsample 2 .",
    "subsample 4 , which uses the bf subsample , shows the largest correlation between peak absolute magnitude and decline - rate , but the fast - declining sne  ia strongly affect the slope . for subsample 5 , which uses the bf subsample excluding the fast - decliners and the highly reddened object , there is no significant dependence of peak @xmath6 luminosity on decline - rate .",
    "there appears to be a weak ( 1.2@xmath5 ) correlation between decline - rate and the @xmath7-band absolute peak magnitude in subsample 5 and still a marginal ( 2.0@xmath5 ) correlation between decline - rate and absolute peak magnitude in @xmath8 .",
    "after removal of the highly reddened and fast - declining sne  ia , we find evidence at the 2.0 - 3.0@xmath5 level for a luminosity vs. decline - rate relations in @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but minimal evidence for such a relation in @xmath6 .",
    "the lowest dispersions in the uncorrected absolute magnitudes are obtained when the highly reddened and fast - declining sne  ia are removed from the sample .",
    "comparing the uncorrected and corrected values , we are at least 93% confident that the slope is nonzero for subsamples 1 - 4",
    ". it could be beneficial to correct the peak luminosity in both the @xmath7- and @xmath8-bands in order for sne  ia to be utilized as precise standard candles in the nir .",
    "the dispersions obtained are smaller than those found in previous nir studies .    as larger samples of sne  ia in the nir",
    "are gathered , and especially as more objects are observed pre - maximum in the nir , an interesting study could be to investigate whether using a @xmath2m@xmath4-like relation , defined in the nir bands ( rather than in the @xmath1-band ) would further decrease the dependence of absolute peak magnitude on decline - rate .",
    "our sample presented here does not include enough objects that have observed nir maxima to test this idea , but future sne ia studies will certainly have more observations that cover the nir peak with greater frequency .",
    "evidence for a bimodal distribution was found for the nir absolute peak magnitudes of our fast - declining sne  ia .",
    "the sn from our sample that peaked before the time of @xmath1-band maximum ( sn  2007on ) had a `` normal '' peak luminosity , whereas those that peaked after the time of @xmath1-band maximum ( sne  2005ke and 2006mr ) had subluminous absolute peak magnitudes compared with the rest of the sample",
    ". it will be interesting to see if future sne ia studies find any slow- to midrange - decliners that possess this bimodal distribution .",
    "it would also be beneficial to obtain larger samples of the fast - declining sne ia at nir , in addition to optical passbands , to further our understanding of these  peculiar \" sne ia .",
    "we also present a hubble diagram for the nir bands and the @xmath1-band , using the parameters derived from subsample 2 .",
    "the rms scatter greatly decreases going from optical to nir bands ( 0.22 mag in @xmath1 to 0.13 mag for combined nir bands ) , again demonstrating that sne  ia observed in nir bands are excellent standard candles . the hubble diagram and hubble residuals in figure [ fig : fig10 ] , along with the weaker dependence of absolute peak magnitude on decline - rate found for the nir bands compared with the optical bands , clearly show the advantages of working in the nir for distance determinations and cosmological studies .",
    "future high-@xmath42 sne ia cosmological studies may therefore benefit from observations taken in the rest - frame nir bands , since sne  ia appear to be better standard candles in these passbands than in the optical ( i.e. , they have a weaker dependence of absolute nir peak magnitude on decline - rate , systematic uncertainties are minimized due to the reduced effects of dust extinction , and nir passbands are relatively insensitive to the exact value of r@xmath61 used ) .",
    "the @xmath6-band , in particular , appears to hold significant promise for such future studies , since it offers an optimal combination of signal - to - noise ratio , low sensitivity to dust extinction , and an essentially negligible dependence of absolute peak magnitude on decline - rate .",
