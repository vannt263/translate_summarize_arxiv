    "due to the advancement of cloud computing technologies , there has been an increased interest for individuals and business entities to move their data from traditional private data center to cloud servers . indeed , even popular storage service providers such as dropbox use third party cloud storage providers such as amazon s simple storage service ( s3 ) for data storage .    with the wide adoption of cloud computing and storage technologies ,",
    "it is important to consider data security and reliability issues that are strongly related to the underlying storage services .",
    "though it is interesting to consider general data security issues in cloud computing environments , this paper will concentrate on the basic question of reliable data storage in the cloud and specifically the coding techniques for data storage in the cloud .",
    "there has been extensive research in reliable data storage on disk drives .",
    "for example , redundant array of independent disks ( raid ) techniques have been proposed and widely adopted to combine multiple disk drive components into a logical unit for better resilience , performance , and capacity . the well known solutions to address the data storage reliability are to add data redundancy to multiple drivers .",
    "there are basically two ways to add the redundancy : data mirror ( e.g. , raid 1 ) and data stripping with erasure codes ( e.g. , raid 2 to raid 6 ) .",
    "though data mirror ( or data replication ) provides the straightforward way for simple data management and repair of data on corrupted drives , it is very expensive to implement and deploy due to its high demand for redundancy .",
    "in addition to data replication techniques , erasure codes can be used to achieve the required data reliability level with much less data redundancy .",
    "note that though error correcting codes ( e.g. , reed - solomon codes ) could also be used for reliable data storage and correcting errors from failed disk drives , it is normally not used for data storage since it needs expensive computation for both encoding and decoding processes .",
    "erasure codes that have been used for reliable data storage systems are mainly binary linear codes which are essentially xor - operation based codes . for example , flat xor codes are erasure codes in which parity disks are calculated as the xor of some subset of data disks . though it is desirable to have mds ( maximal distance separable ) flat xor codes , it may not be available for all scenarios .",
    "non - mds codes have also been used in storage systems ( e.g. , the replicated raid configurations such as raid 10 , raid 50 , and raid 60 ) .",
    "however , we have not seen any systematic research in designing non - mds codes with flat xor operations for storage systems .    in order to achieve better fault tolerance with minimal redundancy in data storage systems",
    ", there has also been active research in xor based codes which are not necessarily flat xor codes .",
    "for example , blaum , brady , bruck , and menon @xcite proposed the array code evenodd for tolerating two disk faults and correcting one disk errors .",
    "blaum , bruck , and vardy @xcite and huang @xcite have extended the construction of evenodd code to general codes for tolerating three disk faults .",
    "other non - flat xor based codes include ( but are not limited to ) @xmath1 $ ] chain code , simple product code ( spc @xcite ) , row - diagonal parity ( rdp @xcite ) , and x - code @xcite .",
    "the techniques that we have discussed above have been originally designed for data storage on disk drives and in storage area networks .",
    "it may not be directly applicable to distributed storage services such as the storage cloud .",
    "there have been many researches addressing the data storage reliability issues in distributed environments .",
    "for example , weatherspoon and kubiatowicz @xcite have compared erasure coding based solutions and replication based solutions for reliable distributed data storage systems .    based on the seminal work of low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes by gallager @xcite , several important techniques ( see , e.g. , luby , mitzenmacher , shokrollahi , spielman , and stemann @xcite )",
    "have been developed for networked and communication systems such as digital fountain for content streaming .",
    "there have also been extensive interests in applying digital fountain techniques ( such as lt codes ) to distributed storage systems ( see , e.g. , plank and thomason @xcite and cao , yu , yang , lou , and hou @xcite ) . however , it is not clear whether these applications of lt codes to distributed storage systems have advantages over other techniques that have been extensively adopted in disk drives and storage area networks such as flat xor codes or array xor codes .",
    "plank and thomason s experimental results @xcite show that ldpc code performs well only asymptotically when the number of data packages increases and it has the worst performance for small number of data fragments ( e.g. , less than @xmath0 ) .",
    "cao , yu , yang , lou , and hou @xcite proposed to use exhaustive search approach to find a deterministic lt code that could be used to decode the original data content correctly in distributed storage systems .",
    "however , by plank and thomason s experimental results , it is not clear whether the exhaustive search approach will work efficiently or even correctly . in this paper , we carry out a theoretical analysis on the feasibility and performance issues for applying lt codes to distributed storage systems . by employing the underlying ideas of efficient belief propagation ( bp ) decoding process in lt codes ( @xcite ) , we introduce two classes of codes called flat bp - xor codes and array bp - xor codes .",
    "the bp - xor codes and array bp - xor codes can be considered as a deterministic version of lt codes though flat bp - xor codes are different from lt codes .",
    "edge - colored graph models were introduced by wang and desmedt in @xcite to model homogeneous faults in networks .",
    "we will show the equivalence between the edge - colored graph model and degree - one - and - two encoding symbol based array bp - xor codes . using this equivalence result , we are able to design general array bp - xor codes using graph based results .",
    "similarly , based on this equivalence result , we are able to get new results for edge - colored graph models using results from array bp - xor codes .",
    "we have implemented an online software package for users to generate array bp - xor code with their own specification and to verify the validity of their array bp - xor codes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ reviewtech ] ,",
    "we briefly review several coding techniques proposed for distributed storage systems .",
    "sections [ challengesec ] presents the challenges in applying lt codes to distributed storage systems .",
    "section [ ltcodesec ] introduces flat bp - xor codes for distributed storage systems and investigates the necessary and sufficient bounds for the existence of the codes .",
    "section [ arraybpxorsec ] introduces array bp - xor codes for distributed storage systems and establish the equivalence between edge - colored graph models and array bp - xor codes with degree one and two encoding symbols .",
    "section [ arraybpxorexamplesec ] presents constructions of array bp - xor codes from graph based results ( e.g. , perfect one factorization of complete graphs ) , and section [ comparisonsec ] proves a theorem on the limitation of array bp - xor codes using only degree one and two encoding symbols .",
    "in the seminal paper @xcite , rabin proposed the information dispersal algorithm ( ida ) to code a data file into @xmath2 pieces that will be stored among @xmath2 servers such that the recovery of the information is possible when there are at most @xmath3 failed servers ( inactive but not malicious byzantine style servers ) .",
    "rabin s scheme is essentially a kind of reed - solomon codes and needs relatively expensive finite field operations for encoding and decoding .",
    "krawczyk @xcite extended rabin s ida scheme to address the byzantine style malicious servers which may intentionally modify their pieces of the information .",
    "krawczyk called his scheme as secure information dispersal algorithm ( sida ) .",
    "there have been extensive interests in applying random linear coding techniques to distributed storage systems .",
    "for example , dimakis , ramchandran , wu , and suh @xcite and dimakis , godfrey , wu , wainwright , and ramchandran @xcite used information flow graphs and random linear coding to achieve information theoretic minimum functional repair bandwidth @xmath4 . in another word , if we divide the file @xmath5 into @xmath6 pieces , store the encoded fragments in @xmath2 storage servers , and if one of these server fails , then a new comer storage server could functionally repair the system only if it could communicate @xmath7 bits from each of the @xmath8 surviving storage servers .    inspired by network coding , acedanski , medard , and koetter @xcite proposed to use random linear coding for distributed networked storage with one centralized server and multiple storage servers .",
    "dimakis , prabhakaran , and ramchandran @xcite considered the problem from a different approach : there are @xmath2 storage servers and many distributed data sources ( that is , data are not from a central location and there is no centralized server ) .",
    "each data source node picks one out of the @xmath2 storage servers randomly , pre - routes its packet and repeat @xmath9 times .",
    "each storage server multiplies what it receives with coefficients selected uniformly and independently from @xmath10 and stores the results together with the coefficients .",
    "luby @xcite pointed out that one of the potential applications of lt codes is distributed data storage systems .",
    "several authors have continued these ideas with fruitful outcomes .",
    "for example , plank and thomason @xcite have considered the practical implementations of ldpc codes for peer - to - peer and distributed storage systems and several experimental results have been reported . in particular , the experimental results in @xcite show that ldpc _ ",
    "codes display their worst performance for @xmath11 \" _ where @xmath2 is the number of data fragments .",
    "furthermore , their experiments show that  _ generating good instances of the codes is a black art ... there is an opportunity for theoretical research on codes for small @xmath2 to have a very wide - reaching impact _ \" .",
    "recently , cao , yu , yang , lou , and hou @xcite ) proposed a lt code based secure cloud storage service ( ltcs ) . in the ltcs scheme , a data file @xmath5 is split into @xmath12 packets , each of which is @xmath13 bits .",
    "lt coding process is then used to generate @xmath14 encoded packets , where @xmath15 .",
    "these encoded packets are divided into @xmath2 groups and each of the @xmath2 storage servers receives @xmath16 packets .",
    "one of the basic requirements from the paper @xcite is that the original @xmath12 data packets should always be recoverable from any @xmath6 healthy servers . for lt codes",
    ", there is a small probability that one may not be able to reconstruct the original data packets from the @xmath6 servers . in order to address this challenge",
    ", the authors in @xcite recommended an exhaustive search method to divide the encoded symbols into @xmath2 groups and check the decodability for each @xmath6 combinations of groups .",
    "the process continues until one finds out one valid lt coding approach .",
    "this approach is not efficient when @xmath6 and @xmath2 are relatively larger .",
    "furthermore , there is no guarantee that the exhaustive search method will end with a valid lt code .",
    "the authors did not give any analysis on how efficient this approach could be or any proof whether that is feasible .",
    "for the case of @xmath17 , the coding scheme in @xcite is essentially a flat xor code that requires a belief propagation ( bp ) decoder ( @xcite ) .",
    "the following example shows that the exhaustive search may not succeed for some cases with @xmath17 .",
    "[ alpha1ex ] for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the original data is divided into three fragments @xmath20 and coding symbols are stored in @xmath21 servers ( @xmath22 ) such that the original data could be recovered from any @xmath23 servers . in order for the belief propagation ( bp ) decoder to work , we must start from an original copy of @xmath24 or @xmath25 or @xmath26 . since there could be two erasure faulty servers , three servers have to store original copies of the data fragments . without loss of generality , assume that @xmath27 , and @xmath28 store @xmath29 , and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "again , since there could be two erasure servers , each data fragment needs to be stored in at least three servers . thus both @xmath30 and @xmath31 need to store @xmath32 .",
    "now if both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are faulty , neither @xmath24 nor @xmath25 could be recovered .",
    "@xmath35    for the case of @xmath36 , the coding scheme in @xcite is a kind of array xor codes ( not flat xor codes ) .",
    "in this case , the robust soliton distribution will be used to generate the @xmath14 encoding symbols . in order for the analysis and bounds of the lt code to work ,",
    "the numbers @xmath37 , and @xmath12 in @xcite have to be sufficiently large ( this has been confirmed by the experiments in @xcite ) . for smaller values",
    ", these bounds may not work and the exhaustive search methods in @xcite may never end with a successful code .",
    "however , for large enough @xmath37 , and @xmath12 , the exhaustive search method will be inefficient and may be infeasible .",
    "the experiment results from @xcite and the potential challenges in the scheme @xcite show that it is necessary and important to systematically study the encoding symbol generation problems for applying lt code to distributed storage systems . in the following sections",
    ", we will show what we could achieve and what we could not achieve with lt codes when applied to distributed storage systems .",
    "in this section , we introduce a class of codes called flat bp - xor codes . in short ,",
    "flat bp - xor codes are flat xor codes that could be decoded with the belief propagation ( bp ) algorithm for erasure codes .",
    "the bp algorithm for binary symmetric channels is present in gallager @xcite and is also used in artificial intelligence community @xcite . in our paper , we use the bp algorithm for binary erasure channels ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath38 be the message symbol set .",
    "the length @xmath39 could be any number and it does not have impact on the coding .",
    "an @xmath40 $ ] flat bp - xor code is a binary linear code determined by a @xmath41 zero - one valued generator matrix @xmath42 such that for a given message vector @xmath43 , the corresponding code @xmath44 is computed as @xmath45 where the addition of two strings in @xmath46 is defined as the xor on bits .",
    "furthermore , a flat @xmath40 $ ] bp - xor code requires that if at most @xmath47 components in @xmath48 are missing , then @xmath49 could be recovered from the remaining components of @xmath48 with the belief propagation algorithm ,    it is easy to see that each flat bp - xor code is a flat xor code , but the other direction may not hold . we can consider flat bp - xor codes as one kind of applications of lt codes to reliable storage system design with deterministic decoding .",
    "example [ alpha1ex ] shows that flat bp - xor version of the lt code may not be applicable to threshold based distributed storage systems as proposed in @xcite . in the following , we first mention the folklore fact to support our arguments .    [ singluarlemma ]",
    "let @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "then there is no @xmath40 $ ] bp - xor code .",
    "the fact could be easily proved by the following observation : let @xmath53 $ ] be an @xmath54 parity check matrix .",
    "if every @xmath55 columns in the matrix @xmath56 $ ] are linearly independent , then @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the hamming weight .",
    "thus for @xmath50 , there is neither binary linear @xmath40 $ ] code nor @xmath40 $ ] bp - xor code .",
    "fact [ singluarlemma ] shows the impossibility of designing flat @xmath40 $ ] bp - xor codes for @xmath50 and @xmath52 . since flat bp - xor codes are extremely efficient for encoding and decoding in practice , we are also interested in flat bp - xor codes that are not mds ( maximal distance separable ) . in the following we show theoretical bounds designing flat bp - xor codes for distributed data storage systems .    for an mds",
    "@xmath40 $ ] code with @xmath52 , we can tolerate @xmath47 erasure faults .",
    "the question that we are interested in is : for given @xmath50 , what is best distance @xmath8 we could achieve for a flat @xmath40 $ ] bp - xor code ?",
    "fact [ singluarlemma ] shows that @xmath8 must be less than @xmath59 .",
    "* tolerating one erasure fault * : let @xmath60 .",
    "the generator matrix @xmath61 $ ] corresponds to the mds flat @xmath62 $ ] bp - xor code that could tolerate one erasure fault .",
    "* tolerating two erasure faults * : fact [ singluarlemma ] shows that two parity check servers are not sufficient to tolerate two erasure faults for flat bp - xor codes . in order to tolerate two erasures",
    ", we have to consider codes with @xmath63 . for @xmath64 ,",
    "the following generator matrices show the existence of flat @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath66 $ ] , and @xmath67 $ ] bp - xor codes for tolerating two erasure faults .",
    "\\left [ \\begin{array}{c|c } i_3 & \\begin{array}{ccc } 0&1&1\\\\ 1&0&1\\\\ 1&1&1 \\end{array }   \\end{array}\\right ] \\left [   \\begin{array}{c|c } i_4 &   \\begin{array}{ccc } 0&1&1\\\\ 1&0&1\\\\ 1&1&0\\\\ 1&1&1 \\end{array }   \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] indeed , the above three codes are the only flat @xmath69 $ ] bp - xor codes tolerating two erasure faults with three redundancy columns .",
    "[ 2erasurefaults ] for @xmath63 and @xmath70 , there exists a flat @xmath71 $ ] bp - xor code if and only if @xmath72 .    _",
    "proof_. let @xmath73 $ ] be an @xmath54 parity check matrix .",
    "the code determined by @xmath74 has minimum distance @xmath23 if and only if every @xmath75 columns in @xmath74 are linearly independent .",
    "this implies that @xmath74 is the parity check matrix of a flat @xmath71 $ ] bp - xor code if and only if for every @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 where @xmath58 is the hamming weight . by the fact that @xmath78 it follows that there exists a flat @xmath71$]bp - xor code if and only if @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath35    * note * : it should be noted that the codes we have constructed in theorem [ 2erasurefaults ] is the well known hamming code when @xmath79 . for @xmath80",
    ", it is a truncated version of the hamming code .    by theorem [ 2erasurefaults ]",
    ", there is no flat @xmath81 $ ] bp - xor code for @xmath82 .",
    "table [ table1 ] lists the required redundancy for tolerating two erasure faults when the value of @xmath6 changes .",
    ".redundancy for flat bp - xor @xmath71 $ ] codes [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values in table [ necessn ] show that for degree one and two encoding symbols based array bp - xor codes , if we want to recover the information symbols from more than three columns ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) of encoding symbols , then we could only have one column redundancy for @xmath84 .    combining theorem [ necessaryarraybpxor ] and values in table [ necessn ]",
    ", we get the following results for edge - colored graphs .",
    "[ edgetheorem ] for a color set @xmath85 with @xmath86 , if we want to design an edge - colored graph @xmath87 ( or a network with more than @xmath88 kinds of homogeneous devices ) with minimum cost , then the edge - colored graph is robust against at most one color failures ( or one brand of homogeneous devices failures ) .",
    "_ based on the results in theorems [ graphtobpxorthm ] , [ necessaryarraybpxor ] and values in table [ necessn ] , we can have the following conclusion : given integers @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath2 , an edge - colored graph @xmath87 with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , @xmath87 is @xmath94-color connected only @xmath95 .",
    "thus the theorem follows .",
    "based on the bp ( belief propagation ) decoding process and the edge - colored graph model @xcite , we introduced flat bp - xor codes and array bp - xor codes .",
    "we have established the equivalence between edge - colored graphs and degree one and two based array bp - xor codes . in particular , we used results in array bp - xor codes to get new results in edge - colored graphs . for array bp - xor codes with higher degree encoding symbols , we do not have general results yet .",
    "it would be interesting to have a compelete characterization of the existence and bounds for array bp - xor codes with higher degree encoding symbols .",
    "these characterizations may be used to design more efficient lt codes or digital fountain techniques .",
