    "in particular , kelvin waves on an isolated quantized vortex line were explicitly excited and imaged for the first time by bretin _ _ e__t al . @xcite .",
    "their excitation method was described in terms of beliaev decay of the quadrupole mode into a pair of kelvin waves @xcite .",
    "further insight for this process was recently obtained by direct dynamical simulations @xcite .",

    "a particularly elusive example is a singly quantized vortex precessing about the trap axis in a harmonically trapped bose - einstein condensate @xcite . in such system",

    "hydrodynamically one may explain such process in terms of a parametric ( subharmonic ) resonance between a quadrupole mode and a pair of kelvin modes , leading to an elliptical instability of the initially straight vortex line @xcite .",
    "the shortcoming of this resonant excitation method is that it is constrained to a specific kelvon .",
    "however , it is possible to circumvent this constraint by deploying the core localized nature of the kelvin modes @xcite . by applying an external pinning potential , such as produced by a suitably detuned laser beam , at the vortex core thereby changing the local effective potential it is possible to control the energies of the kelvons with respect to the condensate ground state energy",
    "since this may be performed in a fashion which does not dramatically affect the resonant quadrupole mode frequency , it is possible to modify and choose the kelvon wave vector which resonates with the quadrupole mode .",
    "quantitatively such controlled kelvon excitation process may be achieved by using the time - dependent perturbation @xmath51 where the first line models a gaussian laser field and provides the frequency shift to the kelvon dispersion .",

    "the weak potential , @xmath52 , in the second line of eq.([kpert ] ) may be realized by rotating an elliptically deformed trap and is responsible for the resonant excitation of the quadrupole mode . in eq.([kpert ] ) , @xmath53 is the rotation frequency of the elliptical perturbation , @xmath54 and we have chosen @xmath55 m with a rayleigh range of @xmath56 m . it may be experimentally challenging to achieve focusing to such a narrow beam waist , however , the method also works for wider beams although the accuracy in determining the dispersion relation may then suffer .",
