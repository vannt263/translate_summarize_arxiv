    "the growth of cosmic structure is driven by the gravity of dark matter , which dominates the mass in the universe . among",
    "gravitationally collapsed systems , clusters of galaxies are the largest and most recently formed ( and still forming ) objects , which evolve via accretion and successive mergers with smaller structures . during a merger , the infalling subsystem experiences ram pressure stripping and the stripped gas mixes with the ambient gas of the main cluster .",
    "being heated to temperatures of 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5  k via mixing and shock heating , the gas shines brightly at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "as most of the baryonic matter in clusters is in the form of this hot gas , x - ray observations are a powerful tool to investigate structure formation @xcite .",
    "however , the process by which stripped gas becomes virialized within the cluster is poorly understood and will depend on the microphysics of the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "recently , observations have shed new light on this process , indicating that the icm in the cluster outskirts may often be clumpy , which suggests a slow or incomplete mixing @xcite .",
    "we observe various features associated with cluster mergers , with sizes ranging from @xmath6kpc to @xmath6mpc .",
    "the three main types of features are shock fronts , cold fronts , and sloshing . when a subcluster moves supersonically through the icm , it drives a shock front , which heats and compresses the gas , producing a sharp jump of thermodynamic properties ( density , temperature , pressure and entropy ) across the interface @xcite .",
    "when a cool dense gas parcel moves subsonically through the rarefied hot ambient gas , we see another type of a sharp contact discontinuity , a cold front , across which both the temperature and density exhibit a jump , but with a contrary relation to the shock front , resulting in an almost continuous pressure profile @xcite .",
    "thirdly , when a merger occurs with a non - zero impact parameter , gas sloshing can be triggered , and will manifest itself by a characteristic morphology ( a spiral pattern or concentric arcs , depending on the line - of - sight orientation with respect to the merger plane , @xcite ) , with cold fronts delineating its edge @xcite .",
    "cold fronts due to icm sloshing are present in many cooling - core clusters @xcite .",
    "these features are useful diagnostic tools for studying gas dynamics during the clusters hierarchical evolution @xcite .",
    "abell  85 ( @xmath7 , @xcite ) is one of the brightest galaxy clusters in the x - ray sky @xcite .",
    "it has been observed with various x - ray instruments , e.g. _ chandra _ @xcite , _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , _ suzaku _",
    "@xcite , and also in other wavelengths , e.g. radio @xcite .",
    "the main cluster hosts an x - ray bright , metal rich , `` cool core '' , and a recent optical study @xcite has shown its brightest central galaxy , holm 15a , is the largest one known so far .",
    "abell  85 is also one of the most complex interacting systems known .",
    "currently , at least two subclusters are falling into the main cluster : one from the south and the other from the southwest @xcite .",
    "additionally , the icm distribution shows evidence for sloshing @xcite .",
    "this remarkable dynamical activity makes abell  85 an excellent system to investigate the process of cluster growth .",
    "the subcluster falling in from the south ( s subcluster ) also has a bright central galaxy surrounded by cool x - ray gas .",
    "it has a clear tail structure , extending to the southeast , previously seen in both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ images .",
    "observations @xcite detected a possible shock front in the northeast of the subcluster .",
    "the second subcluster located towards the southwest ( sw subcluster ) has not previously been studied in detail , but @xcite revealed the gas in the interface between the main cluster and this subcluster to have a high temperature .",
    "this region may be caused by a shock front induced by the sw subcluster merger , but associated radio emission has not been detected except for relic structures which are located at @xmath6150  kpc west of the interface region .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ observations and data reduction ] , we describe our new , deep _",
    "observations , archival _ xmm - newton _ data , and new _ suzaku _ observations that probe the cluster out to @xmath8 along the infall direction of the s subcluster .",
    "we also describe here the data reduction including the imaging analysis , and the production of the thermodynamic maps and deprojected profiles .",
    "we describe the results in section [ results ] , and discuss them in section [ discussion ] .",

    "we used the model of a redshifted ( ` reds ` ) collisional ionisation equilibrium plasma ( ` cie ` ) absorbed by galactic absorption ( ` hot ` ) .",
    "we used the chemical abundance table determined by @xcite .",

    "we obtain typical errors of 5  per  cent for the density map , and 10  per  cent for the temperature , pressure and entropy maps .    in order to emphasize the small azimuthal variations of these quantities",

    "all standard recommended screening criteria were applied .",
    "we only included observation periods with the geomagnetic cut - off rigidity cor@xmath336  gv . we used the latest calibration files that account for the modified non - x - ray background of the xis1 detector following the increase in the charge injection level of 2011 june 1 ; in addition , for the xis1 spectral analysis , we excluded two columns adjacent on each side of the charge - injected columns ( the standard is to exclude one column on either side ) .",
    "we followed this methodology because the injected charge may leak into these additional columns and cause an increase in the instrumental background .",
    "we applied the latest contamination layer calibration from 2013 august 13 .",

    "the galactic absorption column density was fixed to the average value measured from the lab survey @xcite .",
    "the instrumental background was subtracted in the standard way , using the task ` xisnxbgen ` which constructs a background spectrum based on the latest night earth observation files .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) model consisted of a power - law emission component that accounts for the unresolved population of point sources , one absorbed thermal plasma model for the galactic halo ( gh ) emission , and an unabsorbed thermal plasma model for the local hot bubble ( lhb ) .",
    "the parameters of the power - law were fixed based on the best - fit results obtained by @xcite , who analysed regions free of cluster emission in a large _ suzaku _ mosaic centred around the coma cluster .",
    "we note that similar values for the cxb power - law are also obtained by @xcite who analysed a",
    "key project mosaic centred on the perseus cluster .",
    "the parameters for the lhb were fixed based on the all - sky average reported by @xcite using _ rosat _ data .",
    "since the temperature of this component is only 0.08  kev , the signal that it contributes in the energy band 0.7 - 7.0  kev used for spectral fitting is negligible , therefore the best - fitting results are practically insensitive to large uncertainties on the normalization of this component . the temperature and normalization of the gh component were determined by fitting _",
    "spectra from an annulus free of cluster emission with inner and outer radii of 45 and 52  arcmin from the cluster core .",
    "the metallicity of the gh and lhb components were both assumed to be solar .",
    "the pointing in our mosaic located furthest from the centre of abell 85 ( the 46  arcmin offset ) , which was used to determine the best - fitting gh parameters , contains an x - ray bright star within the field of view that could be affecting the results . to mitigate this , we extracted a spectrum of this star and empirically modelled it with a power - law plus ` apec ` model ; we then ran ray - tracing simulations to estimate the level and spectrum of the scattered light from this source , and included this in our spectral fitting of the gh parameters .",
    "we find that the contribution of the stray light from the star amounts to only 5 per cent of the total cosmic x - ray background flux in the 0.7 - 2.0  kev band .",
    "however , adding a cluster component above the cxb in the outer pointing in the mosaic in an annulus spanning 35 - 39  arcmin , we find that the contribution from the star can represent up to 30 per cent of this additional signal .",
    "we thus do not report any measurements of the cluster thermodynamic properties based on the outermost pointing  only the centre and the 23  arcmin offset observations are used to derive the cluster properties .",
    "in the _ chandra _ image and the thermodynamic maps ( fig . [ img_chandra ] left , fig . [ map ] , fig .

    "we note that we have used an extrapolation of the best - fitting beta model for the density ( obtained ignoring the innermost two data points representing the cool core ) in order to correct the density profile for the effect of projected emission from gas beyond the outer edge of the measurements .",
    "the deprojected entropy profile shows an expected low - level excess above the expected power - law behaviour near the cluster core , which is attributable to additional heating due to the agn feedback and ongoing mergers ; at larger radii , the measured entropy agrees with the model out to @xmath8 , with the exception of a dip found around 1.3  mpc ( @xmath41 ) and which is probably associated with the low - surface brightness extension of the tail of the s subcluster .",

    "moreover , the outermost data point in our profile shows an unusually high density ( in most other systems , the density profile is monotonically decreasing even beyond @xmath8 ) . if therefore the density in this outermost data point is biased high , either by the presence of an unresolved group or due to an unusually high clumping factor that is not azimuthally representative , the measured entropy immediately inside @xmath8 could be biased high as a consequence .",

    "the spectrum of the main cluster gas bin was fitted with a single temperature plasma model .",
    "the temperature obtained for the main cluster gas bin was used as one of the temperature components of the two temperature plasma model with which we fitted the spectrum of the subcluster tail gas bin .    the best - fitting temperature of the tail changes from @xmath49  kev with the single temperature model to @xmath50  kev with the two temperature model . under the assumption that the stripped tail gas did not mix with and did not get conductively heated by the ambient medium",
    ", we can use this temperature to estimate the mass of the infalling subcluster .",
    "for the 2.7  kev temperature , the mass - temperature scaling relation by @xcite predicts @xmath511.3@xmath52 . @xcite",
    "estimated the main cluster mass as @xmath53 , which implies a merger mass ratio of @xmath54 .    since this 2.7  kev temperature",
    "is extracted for the vicinity of the cool core region of the subcluster and this temperature is not necessarily representative of the subcluster as a whole , the mass of the subcluster may be underestimated .",
    "however , regardless of the exact mass ratio , this demonstrates that cool cores can be effectively stripped during mergers .",
    "recently , observations of the ophiuchus cluster have shown that sloshing induced by major late time mergers may even destroy the cool core of the main cluster @xcite .",
    "these observations pose a challenge to simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which find that cool cores usually survive late major mergers .",
    "_ rosat _ and _ xmm - newton _ images of abell  85 @xcite have shown a large - scale brightness excess structure extending to the southeast of the s subcluster .",
    "@xcite estimated the temperature of this structure as @xmath62  kev and proposed that it may be either due to the diffuse emission of a large scale structure filament connecting to the cluster , due to a chain of small groups of galaxies , or due to the stripped gas from the infalling s subcluster .",
    "@xcite conducted an optical study and concluded that the structure is consistent with groups falling into the main cluster .    however , the temperature profile measured by _ suzaku",
    "_ shows @xmath55  kev out to @xmath8 .",
    "this temperature is a factor of two higher than the previous measurement of @xmath62  kev at the same radius .",
    "this discrepancy may be the result of the difference in the background treatment .",
    "while @xcite used blank - sky templates , we determined our local background using the outermost regions of the _ suzaku _ observation .",
    "we find that the galactic foreground component toward abell  85 is a factor of three higher than the average value across the sky @xcite .",
    "using background templates will therefore underestimate the background and lead to a lower best - fitting temperature in the low surface brightness cluster outskirts .",
    "if most of the excess emission were due to groups , we would expect @xmath56  kev for a typical group mass .",
    "the _ suzaku _ spectra are inconsistent with such low temperature emission and they show that the temperature of the southern surface brightness excess is consistent with the projected temperature of the bright stripped tail of the s subcluster observed by _",
    "chandra_. it is thus likely that the se brightness excess is also associated with the stripped gas of the infalling s subcluster .",
    "long tails of stripped gas that survive within the ambient icm for over 600 myr have recently been detected in the outskirts of the cluster abell  2142 @xcite and in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the dip in the deprojected entropy profile .",
    "the location of this dip at @xmath2 corresponds to the apparent termination of the se brightness excess .",
    "the dip , therefore , may be caused by the projection of the low - entropy , bright tail gas against a background of high - entropy , faint main cluster gas .",
    "note that this interpretation does not contradict the galaxy overdensity found in the southeast @xcite because cluster mergers usually happen along large - scale filaments ( in the cosmological sense ) , and we expect more galaxies along filaments than other directions .",
    "the fact that the stripped tail of the infalling southern subcluster in abell  85 is seen across a radial range of over 700  kpc , as well as the recent observations of the long trails of stripped gas in other systems @xcite , indicate that the stripping of infalling subclusters may seed gas inhomogeneities in the outskirts of clusters .",
    "the presence of gas clumping in cluster outskirts is seen in simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and x - ray observations of clusters out to their virial radii have indirectly shown that clumping becomes significant at @xmath57 @xcite . in the case of abell 85 , the deprojected entropy profile remains in good agreement with the expected power - law model until @xmath8 , which would imply , at face value , that in this system clumping is not significant at radii @xmath58 .",
    "however , this conclusion can not be drawn robustly because the large error bars on the last two data points inside @xmath8 do not rule out a flattening of the entropy in abell 85 in agreement with that observed in other systems . moreover , this profile is extracted along the path of the s subcluster , which is clearly an unrelaxed direction .",
    "this may lead to the break of the assumption of the spherical symmetry in deprojection .",

    "the overlaid red / blue rectangles represent the radial intervals where the profile drawn in the corresponding color is brighter in the relative deviation images .    for most of the regions , the surface brightness profiles and",
    "the temperature profiles show an anticorrelation typical of sloshing phenomena , namely , alternating bright cooler regions and dim hotter regions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting pressure profiles , each of which is a simple product of density and temperature , are in these regions consistent between the two opposite directions ( see annotations in fig .",
    "[ sloshing_profile ] ) .",
    "however , beyond @xmath6120  kpc of the ne - sw and the n - s directions ( the blue rectangles in the ne - sw and n - s profiles ) , the surface brightness profiles corresponding to the outermost part of the spiral arm are brighter than those of the opposite directions , while the temperature profiles are either similar or the brighter part is hotter , resulting in a clear discrepancy in the pressure profiles between two opposite directions ( see also fig .

    "this value is larger than the width of the northern edge of @xmath610  kpc , indicating suppression of transport processes .",
    "ordered flows of the ambient icm from west to east , resulting from sloshing , can consistently explain both the smooth brightness edge and the bent morphology .",
    "it has been shown in simulations that sloshing causes ordered gas motion , and that magnetic fields are stretched and regulated by the velocity field @xcite .",
    "as the sloshing spiral in abell  85 extends out to @xmath6600  kpc , there may be a non - negligible flow around the s subcluster , from west to east .",
    "the tail of the subcluster may be bent and blown eastward by this flow , which could have a radial gradient . in the same time , the ordered magnetic field lines , stretching from west - to - east could suppress conduction and thermodynamic instabilities , keeping the northern edge smooth .",
    "vla radio observations presented by @xcite have revealed a bright radio galaxy between the s subcluster and the main cluster .",

    "<S> we present the results of deep _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observations of the nearby galaxy cluster abell  85 , which is currently undergoing at least two mergers , and in addition shows evidence for gas sloshing which extends out to @xmath0  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> one of the two infalling subclusters , to the south of the main cluster center , has a dense , x - ray bright cool core and a tail extending to the southeast . </S>",
    "<S> the northern edge of this tail is strikingly smooth and sharp ( narrower than the coulomb mean free path of the ambient gas ) over a length of 200  kpc , while toward the southwest the boundary of the tail is blurred and bent , indicating a difference in the plasma transport properties between these two edges . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic structure of the tail strongly supports an overall northwestward motion . </S>",
    "<S> we propose , that a sloshing - induced tangential , ambient , coherent gas flow is bending the tail eastward . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest galaxy of this subcluster is at the leading edge of the dense core , and is trailed by the tail of stripped gas , suggesting that the cool core of the subcluster has been almost completely destroyed by the time it reached its current radius of @xmath1  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the surface - brightness excess , likely associated with gas stripped from the infalling southern subcluster , extends toward the southeast out to at least @xmath2 of the main cluster , indicating that the stripping of infalling subclusters may seed gas inhomogeneities . </S>",
    "<S> the second merging subcluster appears to be a diffuse non - cool core system . </S>",
    "<S> its merger is likely supersonic with a mach number of @xmath3 .    </S>",
