    "one of the most interesting recent directions in high energy physics phenomenology is the development of brane world scenarios in which our 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime is a 3-brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime . in application to the very early universe this leads to brane world cosmology , where the universe we observe is a 3 + 1 dimensional curved brane embedded in the bulk .",
    "one of the issues in brane world scenarios is the warped geometry of the internal space .",
    "in addition to the warp factor in the bulk , brane world scenarios often contain bulk scalar fields .",
    "examples include the dilaton in horava - witten theory @xcite ( associated with the volume of the compactified 6d calabi - yau space ) where the 5d effective theory can be obtained @xcite ; the randall - sundrum model @xcite with phenomenological stabilization @xcite where the choice of the bulk / brane potentials must be consistent with the 5d warp geometry @xcite , the scalar sector of the supergravity realization of the randall - sundrum model @xcite , bulk supergravity with domain walls @xcite and others .",
    "the 5d bulk scalar plus gravity brane world system is based on the five dimensional einstein equations with junction conditions at the branes .",
    "here we consider a simpler problem where the 5d space can be split into 4 + 1 de  sitter slices @xmath0 the 4d de  sitter geometry is described by its scalar curvature @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the 4d hubble parameter . the warp factor @xmath3",
    "is determined up to boundary conditions by the five dimensional einstein equations . for the sake of generality we also present corresponding results for the more general case of a @xmath4 dimensional warped metric with @xmath5 dimensional de  sitter slices .",
    "the limit of vanishing @xmath6 corresponds to a flat brane , while nonvanishing @xmath6 corresponds to brane inflation .",
    "the brane sets the boundary conditions for the warp factor @xmath3 and the scalar field @xmath7 .",
    "it is known that often the warped geometry ( [ warp ] ) somewhere outside of the brane encounters a spacetime singularity .",
    "one way to cure this problem is to invoke a second brane to screen the singularity by making the inner geometry periodic with the inter - brane interval .",
    "two end - of - the - world branes provide orbifold compactification of the inner space . in the randall - sundrum model @xcite with ads bulk geometry without scalars",
    "the second brane may be removed .",
    "the properties of warped geometry with one or two branes were studied in many papers , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the global properties of 5d warped geometry ( [ warp ] ) for a variety of bulk scalar field potentials @xmath8 , supplemented by boundary conditions at the branes .",
    "we will try to understand how typical is the singularity in the warped geometry , how much tuning is required for the brane potentials , and how these depend on the brane curvature @xmath9 .",
    "our approach is different from what was used in the earlier literature .",
    "the setting of the problem for the geometry ( [ warp ] ) is similar to the investigation of the frw universe geometry @xmath10 with the scale factor @xmath11 and a scalar field with the potential @xmath8 .",
    "powerful method that has been used to investigate this 4d problem is the construction of phase portraits for the dynamic system for variables @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . using this method",
    "it can be shown that for a broad range of potentials @xmath8 inflation occurs along a separatrix that is a typical intermediate asymptotic for a broad band of phase trajectories @xcite .    inspired by this analogy",
    ", we adopt the phase portrait approach to studying the warped geometry of the brane world scenario .",
    "it turns out that the equations for the system @xmath15 with the potential @xmath8 are similar to the cosmological equations for @xmath16 but with the sign of the potential reversed .",
    "( there are also differences in the numerical coefficients in 4d and 5d . )",
    "flipping the sign of the potential makes a big difference .",
    "for example , it alters the geometry of the phase portrait by connecting branches with positive and negative `` hubble '' parameter @xmath17 .",
    "this connection with 4d cosmology suggests a convergence of this work with recent work on 4d cosmology with negative potentials @xcite , the results of which can be extended to the warped geometry .",
    "our results overlap with @xcite and the connection will be investigated further @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the basic equations for the brane world scenario . in section 3 ,",
    "we discuss generic properties of the brane world phase space in terms of @xmath18 and classify its critical points .    in section 4 ,",
    "we systematically construct the phase portrait for a 5d space with flat 4d curvature @xmath19 ( flat branes ) for the simple quadratic potential @xmath20 .",
    "we will see that without branes all trajectories begin and end at naked singularities dominated by the gradient energy @xmath21 of the scalar field , which corresponds to a `` stiff '' equation of state with anisotropic pressure .",
    "we also consider quadratic potentials with positive and negative cosmological constants .    in section 5",
    ", we consider exponential potentials @xmath22 .    in section 6 ,",
    "we extend the method of phase portraits to brane world scenarios with curved branes @xmath23 .",
    "we shall see that the brane with the larger warp factor will have smaller curvature .",
    "we discuss how this effect may be related to the problem of the small cosmological constant on the visible brane .    in section 7",
    ", we derive the hamilton - jacobi form of the self - consistent einstein equations for warped geometry with a scalar field , which leads to the susy form of an arbitrary positive bulk scalar potential ( without any underlying supersymmetry ) .",
    "this correspondence has been previously noted in context of holographic renormalization group flows @xcite .",
    "we also address the similarity of the einstein - hamilton - jacobi constraint equation and the well - known gravitational stability form of the potential @xcite .",
    "in section 8 , we introduce branes to screen the singularities .",
    "we show how the brane boundary conditions can be represented geometrically as a 1d curve in the 3d phase space of the system .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to use the ehj formalism ( in many respects similar to using the susy form of the potential ) . from this perspective",
    "we will discuss potentials that lead to brane stabilization and the degree of fine - tuning required to achieve them .",
    "the paper concludes with the summary of our results .",
    "there is also an appendix in which the locations of critical points at infinity are derived for the phase portraits shown here .",

    "the first term in ( [ action ] ) describes the bulk ; the second term is related to the brane(s ) .",
    "we use a `` mostly positive '' signature and the curvature conventions of misner , thorne and wheeler ( mtw ) .",

    "the bulk potential is just a 5d negative cosmological constant @xmath43 . in case of the hw model , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "our calculations will be valid for arbitrary @xmath46 and @xmath8 .",
    "for 5d warped geometry ( [ warp ] ) the bulk einstein equations can be written as @xmath47 @xmath48 where the latter is a constraint equation .",
    "the equation for bulk scalar field @xmath49 is redundant with the einstein equations .",
    "in addition to the bulk equations given above we can specify boundary conditions at the brane . the assumption of @xmath50 symmetry around each brane @xmath51 implies the boundary condition for the warp factor @xmath52 and for the scalar field @xmath53 unless otherwise specified all boundary conditions are given on the positive side of the brane .",
    "when we refer to a _",
    "flat _ or _",
    "curved _ brane we are referring to its 4d , i.e. spacetime , curvature .",
    "we only consider spatially flat branes , so the term _ flat brane _ refers to a 3 + 1 minkowski geometry while a _ curved brane _ refers to a 3 + 1 de  sitter geometry .",
    "the einstein and field equations ( [ einstein1]-[phiequation ] ) can in principle be solved to find the @xmath33 dependence of @xmath12 and @xmath54 , with boundary conditions supplied by the junction conditions ( [ junction1]-[junction2 ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to compare 5d warped geometry with a scalar field with 4d cosmological geometry ( [ fr ] ) with a scalar field . in 4d cosmology",
    "we have the einstein equations @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the curvature of 3d space , plus a redundant scalar field equation @xmath58    apart from trivial numerical coefficients , equations ( [ einstein1]-[phiequation ] ) and ( [ einstein3]-[phiequation1 ] ) differ in only one respect : for the same sign of the potential in the action ( [ action ] ) the sign of the potential in the cosmological equations will be opposite for the 4d cosmology and 5d brane world cases .",
    "the sign reversal comes about because of the different metric signatures of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the 4d cosmological equations for positive potentials have been comprehensively studied by means of qualitative methods for analyzing odes @xcite .",
    "these methods are equally applicable to 5d warped geometry .",
    "however , we will see below that the sign reversal has profound implications for the qualitative properties of the phase space behaviour .    throughout the paper",
    "we will switch back and forth between a 4d and 5d viewpoint for the potentials we consider .",
    "we will usually talk about the shape of our potentials in terms of the behavior they elicit .",
    "for example , we refer to the potential @xmath61 in 5d warped geometry ( [ phiequation ] ) as a hill rather than a well , reflecting the fact that @xmath12 will tend to accelerate away from the origin rather than towards it for this case .",
    "the same potential acts as a well in the context of the 4d cosmological equation ( [ phiequation1 ] ) .",
    "we will examine the implications of our work for 4d cosmology with negative potentials in greater depth in a subsequent publication @xcite .",
    "dynamical system ( [ einstein1]-[phiequation ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the variables @xmath62 which gives the three `` evolution '' equations @xmath63 plus the constraint equation @xmath64 here @xmath65 .",
    "reduction of equations to a set of first order odes allows us to represent their solutions using phase portraits , i.e. plots of trajectories in the 3d phase space defined by @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "this technique has been applied to the evolution equations for 4d chaotic inflation models in @xcite . in general , all trajectories in phase space must begin and end at critical points , i.e. points where the derivatives of all the dynamic variables , i.e. the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of ( [ phaseequation1]-[phaseequation3 ] ) , vanish .",
    "in addition to starting and ending at such points , trajectories may in general come from or move towards infinity . by making a coordinate transformation of the phase space",
    "coordinates @xmath69 that projects the complete phase space onto a compact region ( poincar projection ) , however , one can define a discrete set of critical points at infinity .",
    "together with the set of finite critical points these points describe the complete set of possible beginning and ending points for all trajectories . by identifying the properties of these critical points ( attractors @xmath54 ,",
    "repulsors @xmath70 or saddle points @xmath71 ) and the trajectories that connect them it is possible to obtain a complete qualitative description of the dynamical system ( [ phaseequation1]-[phaseequation3 ] ) .",
    "( we do not expect more complicated situations for our dynamical system . )",
    "note that the parameter @xmath6 related to the curvature of the branes appears only in the constraint equation ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "just as for standard frw cosmology , our equations for warped bulk geometry can be classified by the sign of @xmath9 .",
    "the case @xmath72 corresponds to curved branes with 4d de  sitter spacetime geometry , @xmath73 corresponds to 4d ads space - time , and @xmath19 corresponds to flat branes .",
    "these three cases correspond to three regions in phase space .",
    "since @xmath9 is a constant of the motion , the phase space trajectories can never cross from one of these three regions to another .",
    "in particular this means that for any particular potential @xmath74 the surface obtained by setting @xmath75 in equation ( [ constraint ] ) defines a limiting surface in phase space that can never be crossed . in later sections we will see the importance of this two dimensional surface for defining the phase space portrait for different potentials . in this paper",
    "we only consider trajectories in the regions with @xmath76 .    in the rest of this section",
    "we discuss finding the critical points for a general potential @xmath77 . in subsequent sections",
    "we illustrate this general procedure with a series of examples for which we construct the phase portraits .    to find the finite critical points we set all _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of equations ( [ phaseequation1]-[phaseequation3 ] ) to zero .",
    "this gives rise to the conditions @xmath78 @xmath79 for positive definite potentials there can be no finite critical points . for instance , for @xmath22 there are no finite critical points . for non - negative potentials",
    "finite critical points must all satisfy the conditions @xmath80 any extremum for which @xmath81 , however , corresponds to two critical points @xmath82    to analyze the behavior near these critical points @xmath83 we consider small deviations @xmath84 and linearize the equations ( [ phaseequation1]-[phaseequation3 ] ) .",
    "we then assume a solution of the form @xmath85 , which gives us a matrix with eigenvalues @xmath86 negative eigenvalues correspond to attractors and positive eigenvalues to repulsors .",
    "critical points whose eigenvalues have different signs are saddle points .",
    "those with imaginary eigenvalues show oscillatory behavior . in our case the finite critical points can not be stable for @xmath87 or for @xmath88 . in either of these cases",
    "there will be at least one unstable direction in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "for @xmath89 and @xmath90 the solutions are stable .    it still remains to find critical points that occur at infinite values of the parameters .",
    "to do this we rescale the infinite space of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 into a finite poincar sphere by means of the variable definitions @xmath91 we also shall rescale @xmath33 by defining @xmath92 .",
    "our phase space as described by the spherical coordinates @xmath93 is contained within a sphere of radius one .",
    "the odes describing our system in these variables are written in appendix  a. here we are only concerned with critical points at infinity , which corresponds to @xmath94 . in general",
    "the terms involving @xmath77 and @xmath95 may be divergent for large @xmath66 , in which case they alter the structure of the infinite critical points .",
    "assuming @xmath74 and @xmath96 are not divergent as @xmath97 , however , the set of infinite critical points turns out to be independent of the potential . given this assumption , we found 8 infinite critical points .",
    "we label them @xmath98 , reflecting their behavior for the potentials we have examined .",
    "( @xmath99 saddle point , @xmath100 attractor , @xmath101 repulsor . )",
    "their coordinates on the poincar sphere are at @xmath94 and @xmath102 for the potentials considered in this paper several attractor and repulsor points are located on the two dimensional surface corresponding to @xmath75 .",
    "most realistic potentials are divergent as @xmath97 , with the result that infinite critical points can be added or removed relative to this generic picture .",
    "for instance , for @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 there are six , twelve , and seven infinite critical points respectively .",
    "nonetheless a close correspondence can usually be seen between the critical points for these potentials and the generic ones discussed here .",
    "as a simple example of a bulk scalar potential we consider @xmath107 . in the equations of motion the mass @xmath108 can be absorbed by rescaling the fifth coordinate @xmath109 , so without loss of generality we simply set @xmath110 .",
    "thus in the general equations ( [ phaseequation1]-[phaseequation3 ] ) we shall use @xmath111 there is one finite critical saddle point for this case at the origin @xmath112 . in the field equation ( [ phiequation1 ] ) this point corresponds to the field sitting at the top of the potential with no velocity and the warp factor neither increasing nor decreasing .",
    "this state is , however , unstable .",
    "as we show in the appendix , there are only six infinite critical points for this case at @xmath113 in other words the set of infinite critical points is identical to the generic case ( [ infcrit ] ) except without the points @xmath114 and @xmath115 , i.e. @xmath116 and @xmath117 in figure  [ fig : crit ] .",
    "the constraint equation ( [ constraint ] ) for the quadratic potential has the form @xmath118 setting @xmath75 in the constraint equation defines the two dimensional surface @xmath119 which is a double cone opening up in the positive and negative @xmath67 directions , see upper panel of figure  [ m2x2h0 ] .    the cases @xmath72 and @xmath120 correspond to trajectories outside and inside the double cone respectively .",
    "for all values of @xmath9 nearly all trajectories begin at the points @xmath121 and @xmath122 on the top of the cone and end at the points @xmath123 and @xmath124 on the bottom , see figures  [ m2x2h0 ] and [ m2x2 ] .",
    "there are separatrices that connect saddle infinite points @xmath125 , @xmath126 with the saddle point @xmath71 at the origin , see figure  [ m2x2 ] .",
    "in this section we consider trajectories that lie along the cone , i.e. `` flat '' geometry with @xmath75 .",
    "as we have mentioned , this case plays a special role in the investigation of the 3d phase portrait .",
    "we consider the case @xmath72 in section [ dsspace ] .",
    "figure  [ m2x2h0 ] shows poincar projection of two dimensional phase space and some of the trajectories for the flat case .",
    "phase trajectories that begin on the double cone surface ( [ m2x2constraint ] ) remain on it .",
    "trajectories that lie off the cone can , and in general do , approach it in the limit @xmath127 , but any trajectory that lies on the cone at any finite point must lie entirely on it . therefore , the phase space required to describe warped bulk geometry with flat 4d slices is two dimensional .",
    "the flat case we are considering is similar to 4d frw flat cosmology with a scalar field , which can also be described with a two dimensional phase portrait @xcite . in the cosmological case",
    "the phase manifold has two disconnected planes , one for an expanding universe and another for a contracting universe ( which can be obtained from the first by time reversal ) . in the 5d case , however , the expanding and contracting regions of the phase portrait are connected , which leads to very different behavior of @xmath3 and @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to showing the 3d phase portrait , figure  [ m2x2h0 ] also shows the projection of one of the cones onto the @xmath128 plane and the projection of the upper half of both cones onto the @xmath129 plane .",
    "there are several interesting features to note about this portrait . as in the 4d case",
    ", trajectories can not pass from one cone to the other .",
    "trajectories can not pass through the critical point @xmath71 at the origin , or through any critical point for that matter , because by definition all derivatives vanish at these points . in the 4d case",
    "this separation meant that for @xmath75 with this scalar potential the sign of the hubble parameter could never change . in the 5d case , by contrast , the geometry of the cone dictates that the sign of @xmath67 , i.e. of @xmath130 , can never change .",
    "consider what this means for the equation of motion ( [ phiequation ] ) , which describes an inverted harmonic potential with friction @xmath131 ordinarily we would expect that if you start on one side of the hill @xmath132 rolling towards the origin you could either go over the top or stop and roll back in the direction you came from .",
    "however , the latter behavior is not possible for our dynamical system .",
    "the reason comes from the behavior of the effective `` friction '' @xmath133 .",
    "looking at the constraint equation ( [ m2x2constraint ] ) we can see that as @xmath67 decreases @xmath134 approaches zero .",
    "once the kinetic energy is small enough @xmath68 will change sign .",
    "this means that the warp factor @xmath3 , which was initially increasing , will begin shrinking . at this turn - around point",
    "the friction term in the scalar field equation of motion ( [ osc ] ) becomes negative , @xmath67 begins to grow again , and the field inevitably makes it over the top of the hill . from that point",
    "onward @xmath67 grows with increasing speed , eventually reaching the singular point at infinity within a finite distance .",
    "( if we insert brane at some @xmath135 so that @xmath3 was decreasing initially then friction will always be negative , and the same result holds . )",
    "this behavior is clear in the phase portraits shown here .",
    "all trajectories must cross from @xmath136 to @xmath137 , and must end up at the infinite critical point with @xmath138 . in other words as @xmath12 grows , @xmath130 grows infinitely faster , so the singularity is reached in a finite distance .",
    "note that on each branch of the cone ( @xmath139 ) there are two topologically distinct sets of trajectories , distinguished by which side of the cone ( @xmath140 ) they are on when they cross from @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "physically this difference simply reflects whether they crest the top of the hill before or after the turn - around point discussed earlier .",
    "these two classes of trajectories are separated by separatrices connecting the infinite critical points to the origin , as can be seen in the right - hand side of figure  [ m2x2h0 ] .",
    "all trajectories begin on the repulsive infinite critical points @xmath121 and @xmath122 where @xmath141 and end at the attractive infinite critical points @xmath123 and @xmath124 where @xmath142 .",
    "this is why eventually @xmath3 always decreases .",
    "the separatrix trajectories are obtained from two curves that intersect at the origin , one each starting from @xmath121 and @xmath122 and ending at @xmath124 and @xmath123 respectively .    near the end points of all trajectories @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and",
    "@xmath124 the gradient term @xmath143 dominates over the potential term @xmath144 .",
    "recall that energy density of the the scalar field from ( [ em ] ) is @xmath145 ; its pressure is anisotropic : @xmath146 , while in the other three directions @xmath147 .",
    "thus , in the regime where gradient terms dominate , we have @xmath148 .",
    "( recall that we use mtw convention for @xmath149 where @xmath150 ) .",
    "the pressure is anisotropic , in the direction of the extra dimension it corresponds to a stiff equation of state @xmath151 , while in the perpendicular direction it has vacuum - like equation of state @xmath152 .",
    "compare this with a stiff equation of state in 4d scalar field cosmology nearby spacelike singularity , i.e.  @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "as we approach infinite values of @xmath130 , we have @xmath154 , in 5d @xmath155 .",
    "this corresponds to a timelike singularity ( say at @xmath156 ) as @xmath157 . near singularities @xmath158 , @xmath159 . in 5d , @xmath160 .",
    "we conclude that the end points of all trajectories correspond to timelike singularities . for realistic models",
    "these singularities should be screened by branes .    to end this section we modify the quadratic potential by adding a cosmological constant @xmath161 , where @xmath162 may have either sign .",
    "negative @xmath162 with no scalar ( or equivalently @xmath163 ) corresponds to the randall - sundrum @xcite model .",
    "in other words we are considering the question of what happens to the rs model ( say ads with a single flat brane ) if one adds a massive bulk scalar .",
    "as we will see , this model has the same gradient type naked singularities that we found for the simple quadratic potential .",
    "once again we take @xmath110 so @xmath164 since @xmath162 is not divergent as @xmath165 the set of 6 infinite critical points is the same as for @xmath166 . to consider the finite critical points and the limiting surface @xmath75 , however , we have to distinguish between two cases based on the sign of @xmath162 .",
    "the limiting surface is given by @xmath167 which is a hyperboloid of one or two sheets for @xmath168 and @xmath169 respectively .",
    "for @xmath169 the potential is positive definite and there are no finite critical points . for @xmath168",
    "there are two finite saddle points at @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "for @xmath169 the phase portrait is nearly identical to the case studied above .",
    "the only difference is that the two cones separate into two disconnected pieces of a hyperboloid . since trajectories for @xmath172 could not pass from one cone to the other anyway , this change has no significant effect on the behavior of the system .",
    "figure  [ m2x2lambdaminush0 ] shows the phase portrait for the quadratic potential with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "there are no longer two separated sheets , reflecting the fact that there are now trajectories connecting positive and negative @xmath67 .",
    "there are two critical saddle points at which the field is sitting motionless at the top of the hill .",
    "there are eight separatrix trajectories , one each connecting each of the four infinite critical points to each of the finite critical points on the limiting surface .",
    "as before all trajectories begin and end at the @xmath67 dominated infinity .",
    "if we fix the brane at the middle of a trajectory , one of the singularity will be screened .",
    "however , without the second brane it is impossible to screen the other singularity .",
    "therefore , the rs model with negative cosmological constant and a single @xmath50 symmetric brane will acquire singularity at final distance if a massive scalar field with nonvanishing condensate @xmath7 is added .",
    "in this section we consider the bulk scalar potential @xmath173 .",
    "dilaton scalar fields with exponential potentials naturally arise in many high dimensional theories .",
    "we consider the properties of warped geometry and dilaton using the phase portrait of their dynamical system . in our dimensionless variables , after rescaling of @xmath33 by @xmath174 , we have @xmath175 .",
    "since the potential is positive definite there are no finite critical points .",
    "infinite critical points will not occur at any point where the potential diverges exponentially , i.e. for @xmath176 .",
    "there are thus 7 infinite critical points @xmath177 corresponding to all points shown in figure  [ fig : crit ] except @xmath178 .    the limiting surface @xmath75 is described by @xmath179 like for quadratic case , this surface consists of two branches , one each at positive and negative @xmath67 , that touch only at a critical point . in this case that critical point is at @xmath180 . for @xmath75",
    "we once again have that @xmath67 can never change sign , meaning a field moving up the potential from negative infinity will always continue on to @xmath181 .",
    "there are , however , two very different ways this can occur .",

    "we have @xmath230 here the scalar field potential is taken as function of @xmath12 which is solution of the self - consistent equations ( in loose terminology , `` on - shell '' value of the potential ) it is not expected that the arbitrary potential @xmath8 will have the susy form ( [ hjcon1 ] ) for non self - consistent geometry .",

    "comparing equations ( [ hjcon1 ] ) and ( [ susy ] ) , we see that the bulk potential ( [ hjcon1 ] ) can be expressed in the susy form ( [ susy ] ) where the hamiltonian @xmath234 plays the role of the superpotential @xmath235",
    ". it would be interesting to understand the relation between these two apparently different approaches to scalar field dynamics in d dimensional spacetime that lead to such similar looking results .",
    "here we have simply noted that the susy form of the potential is a very convenient to treat the bulk and the junction conditions in a unified way .",
    "the brane junction conditions ( [ junction1],[junction2 ] ) in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath234 are @xmath236 where the values of all the functions are taken at the brane position @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , choosing @xmath237 at the brane , we automatically satisfy the junction conditions .",
    "this is similar to the approach of @xcite . here",
    ", however , we make an explicit connection between the superpotential @xmath232 and the hamiltonian @xmath234 .",
    "we also shall notice that for curved branes with nonzero curvature @xmath9 , the form ( [ hjcon1 ] ) is not supersymmetric anymore .",
    "in the previous sections we discussed how to solve the gravity / scalar field equations in the bulk . to complete the brane world picture we must include branes as well , which are embedded in the bulk according to junction conditions ( [ junction1],[junction2 ] ) .",
    "we will consider the case of static branes ( @xmath238 ) only , and assume mirror symmetry across the brane ( @xmath50 symmetry ) .    in the language of phase portraits , the two boundary conditions ( [ junction1],[junction2 ] ) define a 1d curve in the 3d phase space .",
    "the equation for this curve is determined by the surface potential @xmath46 , and can be parameterized by the value of the scalar field @xmath12 as @xmath239 where the signs correspond to the orientation ( the choice of normal vector @xmath240 ) of the brane with respect to the bulk : the upper / lower signs are taken for the brane being on the left / right edge of the bulk , i.e. at lower / higher limit of @xmath33 .",
    "the bulk trajectories must start / end on these curves in the full phase space ( and not at infinity as it was in the absence of branes ) for junction conditions to be satisfied at the brane , as illustrated in figure  [ pinning ] .",
    "the location of the brane is then given by the point of intersection of the phase space curve ( [ ucurve ] ) and the bulk trajectory , and can be uniquely specified by the value of the field @xmath12 on the brane .    if one considers the case of a brane world with a single brane , for many potentials @xmath8 one encounters a problem that , in general , singularities occur a finite distance from the brane ( although there are potentials like exponential potential considered in section 6 , where singularity outside of @xmath50 symmetric brane is avoidable ) .",
    "one possible solution to the problem of timelike singularity outside of the brane in the brane world scenario is to shield the singularity with a second brane . given our assumption of @xmath50 symmetry , the imposition of a second brane would effectively compactify the fifth dimension , making a circle with the two branes at opposite poles .",
    "the junction conditions must then be met separately at each brane , which is not necessarily guaranteed for an arbitrary choice of potentials @xmath74 and @xmath241 .",
    "let us address the question about the existence of warped geometry bulk solution between two branes , if the potentials @xmath242 at the brane are arbitrary .",
    "it is known @xcite that in general such solutions can exist , but they are not expected to be compatible with the flat brane , but rather with curved brane .",
    "we can obtain similar conclusion using the methods developed in this paper . to see this in terms of phase portraits ,",
    "the problem of finding a consistent two - brane solution reduces to finding a trajectory in the full three dimensional phase space that connects the two corresponding junction condition curves @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "geometrically , this can be viewed as finding the intersection of a 2d surface generated by the bulk trajectories passing through the first curve @xmath243 , and the second curve @xmath244 .    as",
    "an intersection of a 2d surface and a curve in 3d is typically a point ( unless they overlap or do not intersect altogether ) , for generic choice of @xmath74 and @xmath241 there may be only one such trajectory ( if any ) , and the brane separation is fixed by its length .",
    "however , this successful trajectory is not expected in general to be located on the @xmath75 surface .",
    "still , one can force the segment of trajectory between branes to be on the surface @xmath75 by simply shifting the potentials @xmath243 , @xmath244 by a constant amount .",
    "this tuning is a familiar tuning of four dimensional cosmological constant on the brane ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that for potentials @xmath242 which are not specially selected , brane worlds scenario is not expected to have flat branes",
    ". the branes in the self - consistent scenario are flat in a special but important case , which occurs when the junction condition curve is also a bulk trajectory , as it happens for hamiltonian of the previous section . in this case",
    ", the two branes of opposite potentials @xmath245 can consistently be placed at any separation .",
    "if one modifies the brane surface potentials @xmath246 by adding quadratic corrections @xmath247 as it was done in @xcite , the solution will be `` pinned '' between @xmath248 and @xmath249 , as illustrated in figure  [ pinning ] , and the brane separation will be fixed by the choice of @xmath248 and @xmath249 . in other words ,",
    "the separation in the space of @xmath12 is translated into the inter - brane distance .",
    "we have developed here a method for systematically exploring the properties of different potentials in brane world warped geometry . to construct the phase portrait of the dynamical system of gravity / scalar",
    ", one can apply the qualitative theory of differential equations .",
    "solutions of these equations are represented by the trajectories propagating in the phase space . for a single bulk scalar ,",
    "trajectories are in three dimensional phase space . for the case of the flat branes ,",
    "all trajectories are located at two dimensional surface , and the phase portrait of the dynamical system can be easily investigated .    in general ,",
    "the phase space trajectories have timelike singularities at one or two of their ends .",
    "these singularities are dominated by the scalar field gradient term , and associated with the infinite critical points in the phase space .",

    "we address the issue how this form of the constrain equation for arbitrary `` on - shell '' potential is related to the requirement to the of the susy form of the potential for gravitational stability of gravity / scalar system .",
    "one can use the phase space with bulk trajectories to study warped geometry between two branes .",
    "junction conditions for each brane generate one dimensional curve in the phase space .",
    "segment of trajectory between two such curves corresponds to the inter - brane warp factor and scalar field . without tuning the potential , this configuration in general",
    "is not located at the two dimensional surface which represents the flat branes , in other words , the solution exist in general for curved branes",
    ". however , one can achieve solution with two flat branes by a simple shift of the potentials .",
    "this analysis can be easily extended for more realistic case of several bulk scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , for two bulk scalars , phase space is five dimensional and brane junction conditions generate two dimensional surface . without tuning the brane potentials , in general",
