    "the aim of this work was to determine periods and spectroscopic orbits of symbiotics , for which observational data already exists but have yet not been analyzed .",
    "high resolution spectra for ae ara were collected with the 2.15 m telescope of casleo at san juan , argentina , during the period 1990@xmath12001 .",
    "we have also collected all published optical spectroscopic data ( see mikoajewska et al .",
    "2002 for references ) as well as visual photometry from the variable star section circulars of the royal astronomical society of new zealand ( rasnz ; fig .",
    "1 ) .    we have measured the radial velocities of the cool component from the m - type absorption lines .",
    "the individual radial velocities were obtained by gaussian fitting of the line profiles an a mean value was calculated for each spectrum .",
    "in addition , we have determined the radial velocities of the broad emission wings of h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 and heii@xmath04686 which are formed in the inner region of the accretion disk or in an extended envelope near the hot component ( see .",

    "optical emission line fluxes were also derived , either by integrating the line profile or by fitting gaussian profiles , as well as the [ tio]@xmath4 and [ tio]@xmath5 indices as defined by kenyon & fernandez - castro ( 1987 ) .",
    "we have analyzed the rasnz visual photometry using the period - search method described by schwarzenberg - czerny ( 1997 ) . we have found a significant frequency peak ( @xmath6 ) at @xmath7 which represents light changes with amplitude of about 0.4 mag and period of about 800 days .",
    "the radial velocities , emission line fluxes , and [ tio]@xmath4 indices ( fig .",
    "2 ) , all show the same periodicity , which we attribute to the orbital period . in all cases , the most regular changes have been obtained with 812-day period , giving the ephemeris @xmath8    the broad emission line wings of heii4686 show the highest amplitude and a mean velocity similar to the red giant systemic velocity .",
    "they are clearly in antiphase with the m - giant curve which suggest that they are formed in a same region very near to the hot component ( fig .",
    "our best orbital solution for the m giant is consistent with a circular orbit and the time of the spectroscopic conjunction coincides with the photometric minimum .",
    "the orbital solutions in table 1 and fig . 2",
    "are obtained assuming @xmath9 and the spectroscopic conjunction given by eq.(1 ) .",

    "the visual light curve of ( fig .",

    "the fact that the minimum is practically as deep as usually strongly suggests that the hot component is responsible for this brightening .",
    "the optical brightening is accompanied by an increase in emission line fluxes ( fig .",
    "2 ) and broadening of the emission line wings . near the bright visual maximum around mjd 46700 , however , the heii4686 emission line flux was suppressed indicating a decrease of the hot component temperature , possibly because of increasing optical depth in the hot component wind .",
    "the observed changes in the emission line profiles are typical of symbiotic stars at outbursts , especially symbiotic novae , and suggest enhancement of a wind from the hot component surface .",
    "such wind seems to be permanently present in as suggested by a presence of broad wings in heii4686 emission line , as well as a broad civ5802,5812 emission lines .",
    "the civ lines are typical for early type wolf - rayet ( w - r ) wc stars and subluminous w - r stars found in some planetary nebula , and they are rarely observed in symbiotic systems .",
    "for example , they were detected during late outburst phase in the symbiotic nova ag peg , and at some phase of the recent outburst of .",
    "in , the civ lines are almost as strong as heii4686 , and their full width is of about 600 kms@xmath33 , similar to the fw of the heii line . both the civ and heii probably arise from the hot component wind .",
    "the presence of such a wind is also suggested by the large contribution of the hot component to the optical continuum .",
    "in fact , the @xmath34 colours of the hot component ( derived from the @xmath34 data corrected for contribution from the m5.5 iii star ) are very similar to those of the hottest w - r / wc stars , which strongly suggests presence of an extended expanding atmosphere .",
    "we estimate the mass loss rate @xmath35 from the intensities of heii1640 and heii4686 emission lines .",
    "the presence of an extended photosphere and moderate velocity wind , makes it difficult to estimate properly the effective temperature and luminosity from the available data .",
    "although , a star with @xmath36 k and @xmath37 , accounts for our observations , both better spectroscopic observations especially in the ultraviolet as well as detailed models will be necessary to get accurate and reliable physical parameters of the hot component .",
