    "with the absence of quarks and gluons in the physical spectrum , we are forced to probe their interaction at low energies by the study of colourless composites of these particles .",
    "this information is encoded in the green s functions of our qft , in particular the four quark - scattering matrix and the quark - gluon vertex .",
    "faced with the richness of the hadronic spectrum , it is not unreasonable to draw a comparison with the complex nonperturbative particulars of these green s functions . in this talk",
    "we will consider the simplest bound states ",

    "to solve the dses , shown for the inverse quark propagator and quark - gluon vertex by ( [ fig : quarkdse ] ) and ( [ dse1 ] ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : qgdse ] , we need to introduce a truncation at some point in the infinite tower .",
    "this need for a truncation also applies to the bse since therein we must specify the ( 2pi ) four - point scattering kernel .",
    "this is a delicate process since we must be careful to preserve various symmetries of the theory .",
    "the most important of these relates to chiral symmetry , expressed via the axial - vector ward - takahashi identity ( axwti ) .",
    "this underpins the observed mass spectrum of the light mesons , and ensures that pions are indeed the ( pseudo)-goldstone bosons of the theory .",
    "this identification is a necessary feature of any serious model and must be exhibited by any truncation of the bses and dses .",
    "the simplest truncation that satisfies this criterion is that of rainbow - ladder ( rl ) whereby the full quark - gluon vertex is replaced by a bare vertex , see _ e.g. _",
    "the axwti preserving kernel in the bse then corresponds to a single gluon exchange , re - summed to all orders thus providing the ` ladder ' .",
    "these rl models are designed to reproduce predominantly s - wave mesons due to the simple vector - vector structure of the interaction . to compensate for this simplicity one",
    "constructs a phenomenological model for the gluon , effectively subsuming additional vertex corrections from the yang - mills sector and unquenching effects .    to separate the phenomenological from the _ ab initio _ , we must investigate the quark - gluon vertex and determine the impact of corrections beyond tree - level to our quarks and mesons .",
    "such studies have been made _",
    "_  @xcite . following the analysis of  @xcite we approximate the full dse with the ( nonperturbative ) one - loop structure of . here",
    "the first ` non - abelian ' loop - diagram in subsumes the first two diagrams in the full dse to first order in a skeleton expansion of the four - point functions .",
    "we neglect the two - loop diagram in the full dse , which is justified for small and large momenta  @xcite .",
    "the remaining ` abelian ' contributions are split into the non - resonant second loop - diagram in and a third diagram containing effects due to hadron back - reactions .    in the next section we consider these resonance contributions , using a rl truncation for the non - resonant parts .",
    "we follow this by exploring a new truncation in which leading non - resonant parts from the non - abelian vertex are included self - consistently in the quark dse and meson bse .",
    "the prescription for including pion degrees of freedom in the dses and bses in a manner consistent with the axwti have been proposed and investigated in  @xcite , with the resultant system of equations depicted by @xmath1{dse - quark - approx4.eps}\\nonumber\\\\    \\includegraphics*[width=0.75\\columnwidth]{bse - pion3.eps}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first loop diagram of both equations relates to the usual rainbow - ladder , where the infrared suppressed gluon is enhanced by the vertex dressing , indicated by _ ym_. the second diagram contributing to the quark dse and meson bse represents the back - reaction of the pion onto the quark .",
    "this requires input of the quark - pion vertex , which we parameterise by a chiral approximation of the leading pion bethe - salpeter amplitude  @xcite @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the scalar dressing function of the quark propagator in the chiral limit .",
    "the effects of neglecting the three sub - leading amplitudes have been quantified for a real - value approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite , and found to be on the level of a few percent .",
    "the advantage of the approximation in ( [ piapprox ] ) is that we can then directly calculate the quark propagator in the complex plane .",
    "we need to specify the gluon propagator and a quark - gluon vertex that subsumes the non - resonant parts of the interaction into an effective rainbow - ladder model .",
    "since here we wish to employ a gluon propagator as calculated from its dse , we employ the soft divergent model ( sd ) for the quark - gluon vertex as described in  @xcite .",
    "we calculated a range of meson observables and observe that the effect of the pion back - reaction has only a small impact on the pion mass itself .",
    "the impact of including pion - cloud effects on the leptonic decay constant is more substantial , with effects of the order of @xmath4  mev :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the model parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 were tuned such that for the latter we obtain reasonable pion observables , and the quark mass is fixed at @xmath7  mev .",
    "what we find is that the mass of the @xmath8-meson is enhanced by @xmath9  mev as compared to pure rl .",
    "this is intriguing since it has long been suspected that corrections beyond rl approximately cancel in the @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this is supported by known estimates of mass shifts from the resonant and non - resonant abelian diagrams in , calculated at @xmath10  mev ( see previous section ) and @xmath11  mev  @xcite respectively",
    "we presented a study of light mesons using two truncations of the bethe - salpeter equations beyond rl .",
    "these considered unquenching effects associated with the pion cloud , and the dominant non - abelian corrections to the quark - gluon vertex stemming from gluon self - interactions . for the latter truncation , we obtain masses for the rho meson of @xmath12  mev , consistent with quenched lattice simulations .",
    "the subsequent inclusion of unquenching effects and other non - resonant contributions to the quark - gluon interaction brings the rho mass back to its physical value thus supporting a long suspected cancellation mechanism .",
    "an investigation based on yang - mills dse results together with unquenching effects is currently underway .",
