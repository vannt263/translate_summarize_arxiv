    "recently , empirical studies have shown that the price fluctuations measured by the returns in financial markets have a heavy - tailed non - gaussian distribution@xcite . understanding the microscopic mechanism of this market phenomena is a challenging problem that has recently attracted the interest of physicists@xcite . in a simple percolation model recently proposed by cont and bouchaud(cb)@xcite",
    ", it is shown that the _ herd behavior _ can lead to the desired fat tails for the distributions of price returns in financial markets .",
    "herd means a collective phenomena or a crowd effect , and it assumes that agents do not make decisions independently , but they are usually grouped into clusters of agents sharing the same information and hence making a common decision@xcite . in the cb model , a random _ communication _ network of agents is constructed and the group size distribution of agents is linked to the distribution of price returns .",
    "it is interesting that in such a simple model the group size distribution of agents has a power law decay with an exponential cut - off , which can be compared with the fat - tailed distribution of price returns in real markets@xcite . to capture further such a herd behavior ,",
    "several extensions of the cb model have been presented , including the fundamentalist influence in the cb model considered by chang and stauffer@xcite , the self - organized dynamical model of eguluz and zimmermann(ez)@xcite and the democracy and dictatorship models proposed by dhulst and rodgers@xcite .",
    "the exponent characterizing the group size distributions in all of these generalized versions was found to be _ robust _ with the same value of @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , however , it was found in a recent work that this scaling behavior can actually be changed@xcite . by introducing the size - dependent fragmentation and coagulation rates in the generalized ez model , the group size distribution of agents",
    "was found to be model - dependent with a tunable exponent @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the exponent characterizing the power law decay for the probabilities of fragmentation and coagulation of groups of agents in the system@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will consider how the demand process in the democracy and dictatorship models@xcite is affected by the dynamical mechanism of the fragmentation and coagulation of groups of agents in the system .",
    "as in ref.@xcite , we also introduce a size - dependent fragmentation rate @xmath3 and a size dependent coagulation rate @xmath4 to the existing models .",
    "we study how the scaling behavior for the group size distribution of agents , together with its character distribution @xmath5 @xcite , depends on the parameter @xmath2 in the resulting system .",
    "we will discuss both the regimes @xmath6@xcite and @xmath7 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the models and present both analytical and numerical results for the group size distribution @xmath8 .",
    "the character distribution @xmath5 of agents is also studied numerically .",
    "section iii contains further discussion of the relationship between the average investment rate @xmath9 and the parameter @xmath2 . a brief summary of our results and conclusions is also given in this section .",
    "the models proposed in this paper are generalized versions of the democracy and dictatorship models introduced by dhulst and rodgers@xcite , which aim to describe not only the information transmission and herd behavior but also the demand process in financial markets .",
    "we consider a system with a total of @xmath10 agents .",
    "initially , each agent is given a microscopic parameter @xmath11 , which is a random number chosen from a uniform distribution between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "agents are organized into groups sharing the same value of @xmath11 .",
    "agents belonging to a group have the same opinion and hence make the same decision at a given moment in time . at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "all the agents are isolated , i.e. each group has only one agent . at each time step ,",
    "two agents @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with associated number @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , are selected at random .",
    "a microscopic investment rate is defined as @xmath18 , i.e. , with probability @xmath19 agent @xmath14 and all other agents belonging to his group decide to make a transaction , i.e. to buy or to sell with equal probability .",
    "after the transaction the group of agent @xmath20 is broken up into isolated agents with probability @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , or the group remains unchanged with probability @xmath23 .",
    "once the group of agent @xmath14 is fragmented each agent in it will be given a new microscopic parameter @xmath11 chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with @xmath26 . on the other hand , with probability @xmath27 agent @xmath14 decides not to make a transaction and all the agents in the group of agent @xmath14 will communicate with the agents in group @xmath15 , i.e. , the two groups of agent @xmath14 and agent @xmath15 will combine to form a bigger group with probability @xmath28 , or remain separate with probability @xmath29 .",
    "once the two groups of agent @xmath14 and agent @xmath15 are coagulated all agents in both the groups will be given a new common parameter @xmath30 .",
    "in the original democracy and dictatorship models , @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the democracy and dictatorship models , respectively .    in the original democracy and dictatorship models , the group of agent @xmath14 is fragmented after a transaction , and conversely the two groups of agent @xmath14 and agent @xmath15 are coagulated if there is no transaction . in the present work , instead",
    ", we introduce a size - dependent fragmentation rate @xmath3 and a size - dependent coagulation rate @xmath4 into the systems .",
    "it seems reasonable for us to introduce such a generalization in a sense that the size - dependent fragmentation and coagualtion rates can be used to mimic some dynamical properties in real markets , such as the growth and bankruptcy of businesses@xcite .",
    "that is to say , smaller businesses are easier to bankrupt , and , on another hand , larger businesses are more difficult to grow up@xcite . so the present models can also be extended to study the size distribution of businesses .    for our present generalized versions we can also write down a master equation for the number @xmath33 of groups with size @xmath34@xcite @xmath35 for @xmath36 . here",
    "the constant investment rate @xmath37 which appeared in the original ez s model@xcite , as well as in its generalized version@xcite , has been replaced by an averaged investment rate @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "each term on the right hand side of eq.([eq : ns time evol ] ) represents the consequence of a possible action of the agents .",
    "the first term describes the dissociation of a group of size @xmath34 after a transaction is made .",
    "the second term represents coagulation of two groups to form a group of size @xmath34 .",
    "the third term represents the combination of a group of size @xmath34 with another group . for groups of size unity ( @xmath38 )",
    ", we have @xmath39 here , the first term comes from the dissociation of groups into isolated agents and the second term describes the combination of a group of size unity with another group . in the steady state ,",
    "@xmath40 , we have @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and @xmath43    using a generating function method@xcite , we can derive a self - consistent equation for the number @xmath8 of groups of size @xmath34@xcite @xmath44 } { [ \\frac{n\\bar{a}}{\\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty } r^{1-\\delta}n_{r } } + 2(1-\\bar{a})]^{2 } } \\right]^{s }   s^{-(\\frac{5}{2 } - \\delta)}. \\label{eq : resulting ns}\\ ] ] for the case of @xmath45 , it reduces to the expression for the original democracy and dictatorship models@xcite .",
    "it indicates that the power law scaling for the distribution of the group number @xmath8 is non - universal , with a tunable exponent @xmath46 for both the generalized democracy and dictatorship versions .",
    "notice that the power law decay is mediated by an exponential cut - off term in eq.[[eq : resulting ns ] ] . for the democracy model , @xmath47 , which leads to a unit value for the exponential cut off . while , for the dictatorship model , @xmath48 , and the exponential cut off will dominate for larger @xmath34@xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows our simulation results for the normalized group size distribution @xmath49 depending on @xmath34 , for various values of the parameter @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "all simulation results are obtained in a time window of @xmath50 for a system with @xmath51 .",
    "averages are taken over @xmath52 independent runs . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the results for the original democracy and dictatorship models are recovered , i.e. , one obtains a power law scaling with exponent @xmath53 in both the models , but with a dominant exponential cut off for larger @xmath34 in the dictatorship version . for @xmath54",
    ", we also have a power law scaling for the group size distribution @xmath8 , but with a tunable exponent @xmath1 in both models .",
    "thus the exponent @xmath55 of the power law scaling for the group size distribution @xmath8 is no longer so _",
    "robust_@xcite , but becomes model dependent and hence non - universal .",
    "one finds that the simulation results for the group size distribution @xmath8 in the region of @xmath54 are in good agreement with the analytic expression given by eq.[[eq : resulting ns ] ] . for @xmath56 , the scaling behavior of the the group size distribution @xmath8 disappears step by step as @xmath2 increases",
    "this indicates that the mean - field analysis of the master equation is invalid and hence the resulting expression in eq.[[eq : resulting ns ] ] for the group size distribution @xmath8 is no longer available once the value of the parameter @xmath2 exceeds @xmath13 .",
    "this break down of scaling can be understood qualitatively as the coagulation rate is too small to form large groups of agents for larger @xmath2 .",
    "an important feature found in ref.@xcite is that the distributions @xmath5 of the @xmath11 s for the democracy and dictatorship models in the steady state are very different .",
    "@xmath57 is defined as the relative number of the agents associated with a value of the microscopic parameter @xmath11 inside @xmath58 .",
    "the results for @xmath5 are presented in figure 2 , for various values of the parameter @xmath2 and a given range of @xmath59 .",
    "for the democracy model , as shown in figure 2a , the system is driven towards a coherent state where the distribution @xmath5 is gaussian - like .",
    "one finds that the amplitude of spread and hence the height of the peak of @xmath5 depends sensitively on @xmath2 . for @xmath54",
    ", the peak grows as @xmath2 increases .",
    "for @xmath56 , however , the peak drops as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this turns out to be that there is a continuous transition for the distribution @xmath5 occured at around @xmath60 .",
    "the distribution @xmath5 for the dictatorship model is very different from that obtained in the democracy model .",
    "as shown in figure 2b , a spontaneous segregation into two equal sized populations occurs , with almost one half of the agents associated with a value of @xmath11 near @xmath12 and the rest near @xmath13 .",
    "the distribution @xmath5 also depends on @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath5 becomes flat as @xmath2 increases .",
    "on the other hand , there is no transition for the distribution @xmath5 as @xmath2 increases , contrary to what is seen in the democracy model .",
    "we have found so far that the size - dependent fragmentation and coagulation rates can have a strong influence not only on the scaling behavior of the group distribution @xmath8 , but also on the character distribution , @xmath5 , of agents .",
    "an agent s microscopic parameter @xmath11 is actually a characterization of the way the agent is perceived in the market , rather than only the individuality of the agent , and hence the distribution @xmath5 determines the decision process in the market@xcite .",
    "the fact that the distribution @xmath5 depends on @xmath2 demonstrates that the mechanism of the fragmentation and coagulation of groups presented in this work has a strong effect of feedback on the market , which is also reflected in the dependence of the average investment rate @xmath9 on the value of @xmath2 as shown in figure 3 .",
    "for the democracy model as shown in figure 3a , the average investment rate @xmath9 decreases continuously as @xmath2 increases for @xmath6 . for @xmath56 , however , @xmath9 increases with @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath9 has a minimum at around @xmath60 .",
    "hence the dependence of the average investment rate @xmath9 on the value of the parameter @xmath2 shown in figure 3a is consistent with the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath2 in figure 2a . for the dictatorship case as shown in figure 3b ,",
    "the average investment rate @xmath9 decreases rapidly as @xmath2 increases from @xmath45 to @xmath61 and becomes flat as @xmath2 goes beyond @xmath62 .",
    "thus there is no transition in the average investment rate @xmath9 .",
    "the results found in figure 3b are also consistent with those in figure 2b .",
    "we can explain the above observations qualitatively .",
    "for the democracy case , it is the competition between the fragmentation and the coagulation of groups that leads to the dependence of the character distribution @xmath5 , and hence the average investment rate @xmath9 , on the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "that is to say , the smaller the fragmentation rate is , the easier it is to form big groups in the steady state . on the other hand , however , it is difficult to form big groups in the steady state in the case of a small coagulation rate .",
    "hence for a small value of @xmath2 , the fragmentation rate is dominant , which results in a decreasing dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath2 exceeds some value , which is about @xmath13 as observed in the simulation , the coagulation rate becomes dominant and hence leads to an increasing dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath2 .",
    "for the dictatorship model , the fragmentation rate is no longer dominant in case of small @xmath2 due to the large average _ effective _ fragmentation rate @xmath63 .",
    "hence the average investment rate @xmath9 depends only sensitively on the coagulation rate , which leads to a decreasing dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath2 for all the values of @xmath64 .    in summary ,",
    "we have introduced size - dependent fragmentation and coagulation rates to the democracy and dictatorship models proposed recently by dhulst and rodgers@xcite .",
    "as in the generalized version of the ez model@xcite , non - universal scaling is found in the systems .",
    "the exponents characterizing the group size distribution in both democracy and dictatorship models turn out to be model dependent and hence are no longer robust . in the original ez model@xcite , as well as in its generalized version@xcite , an investment rate @xmath37 is given artificially and is fixed during the whole dynamical trade process . in our present work , however , the microscopic investment rate @xmath18 is inhomogeneous and is a dynamical parameter governing the demand process of the system .",
    "the most interesting feature of the present models is that the average investment rate @xmath9 is strongly influenced by the dynamical mechanism of the fragmention and coagulation of groups of agents .",
    "hence the new models seem to be better at mimicing the information transmission and herd behavior , together with the demand process and the dynamical feedback inherent in real markets .",
