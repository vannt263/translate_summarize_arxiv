    "since the discovery of a new resonance with mass of around 126 gev , denoted by @xmath2 , at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , accumulative data have shown that it is consistent with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson in the production rates of several channels and the spin and cp properties  @xcite . however , before concluding the particle as the sm higgs boson , more detailed checks have to be done because a sm - like higgs boson can also exist in models with an extended higgs sector . in fact , there is no strong reason why the higgs sector should be minimal as assumed in the sm .",
    "models with additional isospin singlet , doublet and/or triplet scalar fields are worth considering as well , particularly in the interest of explaining tiny neutrino mass , existence of dark matter , and/or baryon asymmetry of the universe . therefore , determining the structure of the higgs sector is of paramount importance in probing new physics .",
    "one basic experimental constraint on the structure of the higgs sector is the electroweak @xmath3 parameter , which is measured to be close to unity as a result of the custodial symmetry .",
    "models with a significant deviation of @xmath3 from unity at tree level are therefore disfavored . it is known that a higgs sector composed of only isospin singlets with hypercharge @xmath4 , doublets with @xmath5 , septets with @xmath6  @xcite , and so on has @xmath7 at tree level ( the electromagnetic charge @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the third isospin component throughout this paper ) .",
    "and @xmath11 satisfying with @xmath12 does not change @xmath7 at the tree level .",
    "] such a higgs sector ( _ e.g. _ , in two higgs doublet models ) is regarded as natural . nevertheless , there are other models with additional assumptions also predicting @xmath7 at tree level .",
    "the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite is a well - known example , in which one complex ( @xmath13 ) and one real ( @xmath4 ) triplet scalar fields are added to the minimal higgs sector , with their vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) taken to be the same to maintain the custodial @xmath14 symmetry . as a result of the symmetry , masses of the higgs bosons belonging to the same @xmath14 multiplet ( one 5-plet , one 3-plet and one singlet in the model ) are the same at tree level .",
    "discovering these additional higgs bosons would be clear evidence of the model , and its phenomenology has been studied recently in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if the higgs mechanism is fully responsible for the breakdown of electroweak symmetry , studying the couplings between @xmath2 and the weak gauge bosons , collectively denoted by @xmath0 , serves as another approach to deciphering the structure of the higgs sector . throughout the paper",
    ", we take @xmath15 because of the approximate custodial symmetry .",
    "these couplings can be directly learned from scattering processes of weak gauge bosons .",
    "if , due to participation of other scalar bosons in the extended higgs sector , @xmath0 couplings deviate from their sm values , an immediate consequence is that the scattering of the longitudinal components of weak bosons becomes strong at high energies  @xcite until heavier active higgs bosons show up to unitarize the amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the possibility for observing such partially enhanced weak boson scatterings at the lhc had been analyzed in the post higgs discovery era  @xcite .",
    "the result does not look very promising unless one goes for a high integrated luminosity and high invariant mass for the 14-tev lhc .",
    "in contrast , a more prominent effect due to the nonstandard @xmath0 couplings should already be observable at lower energies , as we will show in this work .",
    "although the precision is still poor , current higgs search data hint at somewhat larger @xmath0 couplings than the sm expectation from the viewpoint of global fitting .",
    "this is another motivation for us to consider the gm model , where the @xmath0 couplings can be enhanced from their sm values  @xcite , a feature that is not shared by models with a higgs sector composed of only doublet and singlet fields ( _ e.g. _ , two higgs doublet models ) . at the tree level such as",
    "the simplest higgs triplet model can also have larger @xmath0 couplings .",
    "however , their deviation is as small as @xmath16 due to the constraint from the @xmath3 parameter  @xcite . ] therefore , verifying the enhanced @xmath0 couplings would be evidence of the gm model or the like .    in this paper , we perform a @xmath17 fit to the current higgs search data at the lhc within the framework of the gm model .",
    "the @xmath0 couplings are found to be larger than the sm values , with a maximum reaching @xmath18 at the 68@xmath19 confidence level ( cl ) while still allowed by other constraints : vacuum stability , perturbative unitarity , @xmath20 data , and electroweak precision data . in this case , masses of the heavier higgs bosons are preferably at the order of a few hundred gev . taking the enhanced @xmath0 couplings and including contributions from the heavy higgs bosons , we study effects on weak boson scattering processes @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 at the lhc   process in the context of searching for higgs triplets has been discussed in ref .  @xcite . ] .",
    "the corresponding parton - level processes at the lhc are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the cross sections of these processes are increased by the enhanced @xmath0 couplings and the mediation of heavy higgs bosons . in general",
    ", we find excesses in invariant mass and transverse mass distributions . in the system of @xmath27 ,",
    "excess events are seen at and below the @xmath28 pole in the leptonic invariant mass distribution . a jacobian - like peak with an edge at around 126 gev",

    "there is no decoupling limit in that case . ]",
    "we thus identify @xmath2 as the sm - like higgs boson with the mass of 126 gev .    in the general case with mixing ( _ i.e. _ , non - decoupling case )",

    "one may think that , unlike in the sm , the modified weak gauge boson couplings for @xmath2 in the gm model would spoil the cancellation of @xmath99 dependence in the amplitude of @xmath100 scattering at high energies ( @xmath101 denotes the longitudinal component of @xmath102 or @xmath28 ) .",
    "in fact , the unitarity of the scattering amplitudes is restored by including the contributions of the extra higgs bosons .",
    "for example , in the @xmath103 scattering , the @xmath104-channel and @xmath105-channel diagrams mediated by @xmath2 , @xmath70 and @xmath75 give the amplitudes @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , with @xmath108 being the scattering angle .",

    "the total contribution from the higgs - exchanging diagrams to the @xmath103 process is then the same as that in the sm at @xmath99 , to be cancelled by the pure gauge contributions .",
    "if the masses of the extra higgs bosons are heavy , the cancellation would be delayed until the scale of their masses is reached and the scattering strength becomes stronger in the intermediate scale .",
    "apparently , a clear observation of significant @xmath100 scattering phenomena can serve the purpose of probing the extended higgs sector .",
    "unfortunately , the effects such scatterings at lhc are found to be inconspicuous without demanding a large integrated luminosity and going to the high ( multi - tev ) invariant mass regime , as studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "this is partly because the sm - like higgs boson , @xmath2 , has largely unitarized the scattering amplitudes and the cross sections are suppressed by the mass of light quarks involved in the initial state .    in this paper",

    ", there is no full calculations of qcd corrections to all the vector boson scattering processes .",
    "however , qcd corrections to the higgs production via vector boson fusion processes have been worked out in refs .",
    "@xcite at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and subsequently at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in refs .",
    "@xcite . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the total cross section for the vector boson fusion production of a 125-gev higgs boson at nnlo differ from the sm is less than 10% , less than the uncertainty due to choices of parton distribution functions .    summarizing this section ,",
    "we emphasize that an enhancement at and below 126 gev in the lepton invariant mass distribution of the @xmath27 system would prefer models with @xmath0 couplings larger than the sm value , with the gm model being a well - defined example .",
    "moreover , it is a distinctive feature of the gm model to have an enhanced peak in the transverse mass distribution of the @xmath27 system with an edge at around 126 gev and that of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 systems at around the @xmath179 mass .",
    "based on latest higgs search data at the lhc , we have discussed the possibility of a larger - than - sm @xmath0 couplings between the sm - like higgs boson and the weak gauge bosons .",
    "such a scenario can be readily realized in the georgi - machacek model or models with scalars of an appropriate representation .",
    "we have performed @xmath17 fits to the signal strength data provided by the atlas and cms collaborations for various higgs production channels at the lhc , showing that currently the @xmath0 couplings can be at most @xmath18 times the sm value at the 68@xmath19 cl while consistent with several constraints , including the vacuum stability , the perturbative unitarity , the @xmath20 data and the electroweak precision data .",
    "this result , along with the fact that the 126-gev higgs boson has largely unitarized the longitudinal weak boson scattering amplitudes , has led us to consider the scatterings in the multi - hundred gev regime .",
    "we selected two representative scenarios , gm 13 and gm15 , to perform a simulation study for three types of processes involving the weak boson scatterings and compare them with the sm background .",
    "the expected numbers of events after the basic and forward - jet tagging cuts for the lhc running at 8 and 14 tev are given in table  [ cross ] .",
    "in particular , we have shown that features due to the enhanced @xmath0 couplings can be easily identified by jacobian - like peaks in the transverse mass distributions of the @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 systems , with the edges signifying the masses of the higgs bosons with the dominant contributions .",
    "therefore , measuring such scattering events is not only important in determining whether the @xmath0 couplings are stronger than sm expectation , but also useful to discover additional higgs bosons in the sub - tev regime .",
