    "in a previous paper @xcite , which we shall call paper i , we showed that one can uniquely define the lematre - tolman cosmological model @xcite by specifying an initial density profile ( i.e. the mass - density as a function of the radial coordinate at an initial instant @xmath0 ) and a final density profile .",
    "the formulae defining the l - t functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the active gravitational mass , used here as a radial coordinate ) are implicit but unique , and can be solved for @xmath4 and @xmath5 numerically .",
    "( for definitions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 see eqs .",
    "( [ ltds2 ] ) and ( [ rtsq ] ) . )",
    "we also worked out a numerical example in which a galaxy - cluster - like final profile was created out of an initial profile whose density amplitude and linear size were small .    in the present paper",
    ", we develop that study for new elements : we show that instead of a density distribution , one can specify a velocity distribution ( strictly speaking , this is @xmath6  a measure of the velocity ) at either the initial instant or the final instant or both .",
    "we prove a theorem , analogous to the one proven in paper i : given the initial and the final profile , the l - t model that evolves between them is uniquely determined .",
    "we also show how to adapt the initial and final density profiles to the astrophysical data more precisely than it was done in paper i. we provide numerical examples of l - t evolution between an initial profile ( of density or velocity ) consistent with the implications of the cmb measurements , and a final profile that corresponds either to a galaxy cluster or to a void .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we recall the basic properties of the l - t model in sec .",
    "2 . in sec .",
    "3 we describe how the final profile can be adapted to observational data more exactly than in paper i. in sec .",
    "4 we find the implicit formulae to define the l - t functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 when the initial state is specified by a velocity distribution and the final state by a density distribution . in sec .",
    "5 we do the same for both states being specified by velocity distributions . in sec .",
    "6 we deduce the amplitude of the velocity perturbation at @xmath7 allowed by observations of the cmb radiation . in sec .",
    "7 we specify our choices of density and velocity profiles for numerical investigations .",
    "secs . 8 and",
    "9 contain the presentation of numerical results in several figures .",
    "the results are summarized and interpreted in sec .",
    "10 , and brief conclusions follow in sec . 11 .",
    "the approach presented in this and in paper i is more suited to astrophysical practice than the traditional approach , in which we first try to deduce the initial state of the universe from various kinds of data , and then proceed to calculate the evolution of the cosmological model , in order to compare its final state with the observations of the current state of the actual universe .",
    "our approach allows one to make simultaneous use of the data on the initial and on the final state of the universe  the real astronomical data is indeed such a mixture .",
    "naturally the l - t model can describe the actual astrophysical process of structure formation only approximately .",
    "the obvious limitation is spherical symmetry , in consequence of which we can not take into account the rotation of the objects formed .",
    "thus , no matter how well we reproduce the profile of a galaxy or cluster , the l - t model will continue to evolve , and the profile will look quite different after @xmath8 years or less , whereas real galaxies and clusters are fairly stable over @xmath9 years .",
    "however , we hope that the method presented here will be a starting point for generalisations that will be done once ( and if ) more general exact cosmological models are discovered .",
    "the lematre - tolman ( l - t ) model @xcite is a spherically symmetric nonstatic solution of the einstein equations with a dust source .",
    "its metric is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an arbitrary function ( arising as an integration constant from the einstein equations ) , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 obeys @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the cosmological constant .",
    "( [ rtsq ] ) is a first integral of the einstein equations , and @xmath16 is another arbitrary function that arises as an integration constant .",
    "the mass - density is : @xmath17 see @xcite for an extensive list of properties and other work on this model . in the following",
    ", we will assume @xmath18 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ rtsq ] ) can be solved explicitly .",
    "the solutions are the following .",

    "this means one of the three functions @xmath11 , @xmath16 and @xmath30 can be fixed at our convenience by the appropriate choice of @xmath33 .",
    "the friedmann models are contained in the lematre - tolman class as the limit : @xmath34 and one of the standard radial coordinates for the friedmann model results if , in addition , the coordinates in ( [ ellev ] )  ( [ hypev ] ) are chosen so that : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "this implies @xmath37 being the robertson - walker curvature index",
    ".    it will be convenient in most of what follows to use @xmath16 as the radial coordinate ( i.e. @xmath38 ) because , in the structure formation context , one does not expect any  necks \" or  bellies \" where @xmath39 , and so @xmath16 should be a strictly increasing function in the whole region under consideration . then : @xmath40 from which we find @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath36 will commonly be zero .    in the present paper we will apply the l - t model to problems of a similar kind to that considered in paper i : connecting an initial state of the universe ( defined by _ either _ a mass - density distribution _ or _ a velocity distribution ) to a final state ( also defined by one of these distributions ) by an l - t evolution , and in particular to the formation of galaxy - cluster - like and void - like objects out of initial perturbations of density or velocity that are small in amplitude and in some cases small in mass compared to the final object .",
    "we will now incorporate in our models the observational data on mass distribution in galaxy clusters in a more detailed way than in paper i.    the quantities of interest in the profile are the following : the maximal density ( with the shapes we assume below and later , this will be at the center of the object ) , the radius of the object ( assumed spherically symmetric ) , the mass of the object , the average density of the cosmic background , and the compensation radius ( defined below ) .",
    "we define the following parameters .",
    "* @xmath43  the mass of a galaxy cluster , out to some radius ; to be taken from astronomical tables . * @xmath44  the radius within which the mass @xmath43 is contained ; also to be taken from astronomical tables .",
    "in fact there may be two or more @xmath43@xmath44 pairs available for some clusters ( see section [ abellclusterprofilechoices ] ) .",
    "* @xmath45  this is the geometrical definition of the mass @xmath43 ( @xmath46 at that value of @xmath47 at which @xmath48 equals a certain specified multiple of the background density ) . used in astronomy is : the size @xmath44 of a galaxy cluster is that radius , at which the _ average _ density within @xmath44 equals a specified multiple of the background density @xmath49 ( e.g. 200 @xcite ) . with this definition ,",
    "the procedure of determining @xmath50 is different from the one presented in eqs .",

    "* the compensation radius @xmath53 , at which the total mass within @xmath54 is the same as the background mass would be if no inhomogeneity were created .",
    "this is needed to let us know roughly where our inhomogeneity is matched to the friedmann background .",
    "see subsection [ comprad ] .",
    "the matching of contained mass at @xmath55 is not sufficient for a swiss - cheese type matching , as we have not required the time since the bang to match up at this location , and therefore is technically the wrong definition . if our ` compensation ' procedure were executed at each time , the resulting surface would not be properly matched , nor would it be comoving . ] .",
    "however , it has the advantage that it can be calculated knowing only the density profile at a given time , and under the circumstances used here is a fairly good estimate .",
    "all our models are then calculated out to @xmath56 , i.e @xmath57 .",
    "we can put upper and lower limits on the compensation radius and mass . for a condensation of measured mass @xmath43 ,",
    "the @xmath56 value obviously can not be less than this .",
    "in fact the region around the visible condensation , though of low density is of large volume , and will add noticeably to the mass to be ` compensated for ' .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 where eq .",
    "( [ rho_b(t ) ] ) gives @xmath59  g / cc . in the chosen parabolic background , or more conveniently @xmath60    on the other hand ,",
    "the observed average separation of condensations puts an upper limit on @xmath55 .",
    "since the contents of the universe are a mixed bag of galaxy clusters , rich clusters , superclusters , field galaxies , voids , walls , etc , the average separation of rich clusters say is not meaningful for this purpose .",
    "so we instead argue that there are around @xmath61 large galaxies & @xmath62 dwarf galaxies within @xmath9 light years . at",
    "say @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , this gives a mean density of around @xmath65mpc@xmath66  kg / m@xmath67 .",
    "therefore an object of mass @xmath43 in @xmath68 should on average occupy a volume of radius about @xmath69    for a galaxy of @xmath63 , these two limits are @xmath70  mpc , whereas for an abell cluster of @xmath71 , these two limits are @xmath72  mpc .    for a void , the interior density will not be zero , but is not well known , and the radius is of the order of 60  mpc . only by including some of the galaxies in the surrounding walls can one bring the average density up to the background value .",
    "so @xmath73  mpc , which at background density gives @xmath74 .",
    "since little is known about mass - distribution within galaxy clusters , we can not attempt to model any actual cluster to any significant accuracy .",
    "however , we wish to show that such modelling is in principle possible . therefore , for the beginning",
    ", we will use the profile from paper i and will show below that its free parameters can be made equal to some observed / observable quantities .",
    "let @xmath49 be the background density .",
    "we choose the profile at @xmath75 to be @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath50 are free parameters to be adapted to the observational constraints .",
    "given two pairs of @xmath78 data , @xmath79 & @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 for each of them , and each can be solved for @xmath77 , so that : @xmath82 this is solved numerically for @xmath50 , and @xmath77 follows .",
    "the compensation radius @xmath55 is determined by the condition that the mean density out to @xmath3 equals the background density : @xmath83 this is solved for @xmath56 numerically , and @xmath55 follows from ( [ finrdef ] ) .",
    "we looked for density profiles that are considered realistic by astronomers . as it turned out , there is no general agreement as to which profile best describes observations , and no generally accepted definition of the radius of a galaxy cluster exists .",
    "however ( see the acknowledgements ) the following ` universal profile ' is one of the more commonly used formulas for density vs. distance profiles @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath49 is the average density in the universe , @xmath85 is a dimensionless factor and @xmath86 is a scale distance .",
    "( this is a newtonian formula , in which @xmath87 is the euclidean distance . )",
    "according to the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , this profile applies for @xmath87 changing by two orders of magnitude .    for our procedure ,",
    "we need the density given as a function of mass , which can not be found analytically for the above profile . ) , is very different from the flat - space relation @xmath88",
    ". we will carry over to relativity the equation @xmath89 resulting from the newtonian relation with the hope that it is a good approximation at low densities and for small radii from the centre .",
    "however , a completely self - consistent approach would require re - interpretation of all the relevant astronomical observations against the l - t model . ]",
    "the calculation @xmath90 can always be done numerically , but it is more instructive to have exact explicit formulae .",
    "we therefore approximate @xmath91 separately in the ranges @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    for @xmath94 a taylor series around @xmath95 up to @xmath96 gives @xmath97 which converts the profile ( [ nafwprof ] ) to : @xmath98 like the original profile , this one has the unpleasant property that the density becomes infinite at @xmath99 , so we modify it to @xmath100 where @xmath101 is small compared to @xmath102 , and this can be integrated to give @xmath103 .",
    "when @xmath93 , the approximation @xmath104 substituted into ( [ nafwprof ] ) gives @xmath105 where @xmath106 has again been added into the denominator to permit a non - divergent central density .",
    "the corresponding @xmath107 is still elementary . only . however ,",
    "all our numerical codes cover @xmath108 , so we added @xmath106 to avoid modifying the codes . ]    the profiles ( [ corprofatcent ] ) and ( [ corprofar ] ) were the starting point for our considerations .",
    "the profiles actually used in numerical examples were various modifications of these ( see sec .",
    "[ profit ] ) , done in order to better fit our profiles to observational data .",
    "we assume that the condensed object ( model of a galaxy cluster ) was created out of a small localized initial density or velocity perturbation , superimposed on the homogeneous spatially flat friedmann background . during the evolution ,",
    "the perturbation was increasing in density amplitude and in mass , and thus was effectively drawing more mass into the condensation region out of the surrounding homogeneous region would imply that the whole infinite background adjusted its density to the central bump , which would imply propagating the density wave to an infinite distance in a finite time . ]",

    "the profile need not be compensated .",
    "for an uncompensated profile , it is good if it is localized ( i.e. the perturbation is zero for @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the assumed mass of the initial perturbation ) .",
    "then the definitions of the radius and mass of the perturbation are straightforward .    we choose for this profile the cosine shape @xmath112 ; \\\\     \\rho_b = \\text{const }   &   \\text{~~for~ } m \\geq m_1   \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath113 .",
    "then @xmath114 is the maximal value of density , with @xmath115 being the density amplitude from astronomical data , while @xmath111 is the total mass of the initial perturbation .",

    "we did one run with this kind of initial profile ( @xmath48i4 in table [ infndenprofiletab ] ) in order to demonstrate more clearly the point we made in paper i : that the mass of the `` seed '' structure existing at time @xmath7 can be much smaller than the mass of the galaxy cluster into which it will evolve .",
    "the other initial profiles are either flat ( see table [ runlist ] and sec . [ results ] for reasons why ) or go into the background only asymptotically .",
    "the quantity that is a measure of the velocity distribution of the dust in an l - t model is @xmath120 this is constant in any robertson - walker model , so its nonconstancy is a measure of the velocity inhomogeneity .",
    "suppose we wish to adapt an l - t model to a given initial velocity distribution @xmath121 at @xmath109 , and to a given density distribution @xmath122 at @xmath123 .",
    "this is a different set of data from the one considered in paper i , and so the existence of such an evolution has to be proven . the functions appearing along the way are different , but the overall mathematical scheme is essentially the same .",
    "as before , we will mostly be using the mass @xmath3 as the radial coordinate , and in each case we will assume that at the initial instant @xmath7 the configuration is expanding , so @xmath124 analogous reasoning can be carried out for matter that is initially collapsing , but this situation is just covered by the time reverse of the method given here and is not relevant for the problem of structure formation .",

    "this will tell us about the relative importance of the velocity and density distributions for structure formation .",
    "in particular , with @xmath148 = const , the @xmath149 will tell how big the initial density inhomogeneity has to be when the initial velocity distribution is exactly homogeneous , while the final structure is given .",

    "some other previously known features of the l - t model , such as the possibility that clumps could evolve into voids , were highlighted in the results section by producing examples .",
    "it is clear from the method of paper i that , for any @xmath32 value , whatever solution is found for @xmath390 , its time reverse ( @xmath391 , @xmath392 ) will solve the case when the density values are interchanged .",
    "but could both @xmath393 and @xmath394 occur at different @xmath32 values @xmath395 & @xmath396 in the same model ? it is obvious that a model with adjacent expanding and collapsing hyperbolic regions must have severe shell crossings , unless they were separated by a neck @xcite .",
    "but the latter puts the two hyperbolic regions on either side of a wormhole , so they do nt really communicate . on the other hand it seems entirely possible that two worldlines in an elliptic region could display such behaviour , or even a hyperbolic region outside an elliptic region .    in paper",
    "i , the condition @xmath397 was imposed merely to ensure @xmath398 , which allowed us to know there was always a bang in the past , and hence a well defined @xmath5 .",
    "however , we note that this condition did not exclude other equally unreasonable possibilities , such as an elliptic region outside a hyperbolic region ( see @xcite ) .    thus ,",
    "if we relax this requirement , and allow all @xmath399 and all @xmath400 profiles , we merely have to note which of @xmath128 & @xmath172 is larger before generating the `` forwards '' or `` backwards '' solution .",
    "we in any case have to check whether the conditions for no shell crossings @xcite are satisfied , or whether a regular maximum or minimum has been reached , and this merely adds one more thing to check  whether the bang and crunch functions are sufficiently continuous .",
    "given the expression for the density , ( [ rholt ] ) it is clear that if @xmath401 for a particular @xmath32 , but @xmath402 and @xmath403 are not zero , the density will be zero there for all time .",
    "is it possible that @xmath404 at isolated events , or on non - comoving worldsheets ?    assuming @xmath405 and @xmath406 , the only way for this to happen would be for @xmath407 to diverge without changing sign , while @xmath408 remains finite .",
    "we immediately see that divergent @xmath407 makes @xmath409 divergent , which suggests bad coordinates at the very least .",
    "however , for all @xmath4 values we may write @xcite @xmath410 r_{,t }     \\end{split}\\ ] ] and it is clear that @xmath411 is only divergent on the bang or crunch , while @xmath412 is zero there , because @xmath413 at early times .",
    "so one possibility is that @xmath7 intersects a non - simultaneous bang while @xmath75 does not intersect the crunch at the same @xmath32 value , or vice versa .",
    "this of course means the constant time surface can not be extended beyond this point , which is not really satisfactory .",
    "the only other possibility is for @xmath402 or @xmath414 to diverge . to diverge",
    ", then we need @xmath415 to diverge faster , and the argument is pretty much the same . ] but this would give a comoving zero of density , and a coordinate transformation would make @xmath402 and/or @xmath414 finite and @xmath408 zero .",
    "thus we conclude that , apart from the case of the initial or final surface intersecting the bang or crunch , the density along a particle worldline can not be zero at one time and non - zero at another .",
    "thus zeros of density have to be permanent and comoving .",
    "to look at the question of whether zero density at a single @xmath3 value can be accommodated in the methods of paper i , we first determine what kind of zero we might expect in @xmath350 . working in flat 3-d space , let @xmath417 near a zero in @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath418 so , to lowest order @xmath419 which means @xmath420 and we notice @xmath421 always .",
    "if we use this as an approximation near a point zero in the full curved spacetime expression , we find @xmath422 which is indeed well determined . we thus conclude that no modification of the paper i method is needed in principle , though some extra coding might be needed if the integration had to be done numerically .",
    "( with all the profiles tried so far , maple did symbolic integrations to get @xmath423 . )",
    "we have already seen that zeros in the density have to be permanent and comoving , and this obviously applies to extended vacuum regions . in any case",
    ", spherically symmetric vacuum is schwarzschild and must remain so .    in order to allow the possibility that @xmath424 is zero over a finite range",
    ", the choice @xmath425 must be abandoned as all points in the zero density region will have the same mass , so @xmath3 will be a degenerate coordinate there .",
    "whatever alternative possibilities we choose must allow us to identify the corresponding comoving coordinate points on each of the density profiles at @xmath7 & @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath13 is not a suitable coordinate , as the two @xmath426 are different .",
    "thus we instead consider the following alternatives :    1 .",
    "specify @xmath427 and @xmath428 + this parametric version of choosing @xmath350 , allows @xmath429 and @xmath430 over some range of @xmath32 , but actually is not sufficient , as we still have no idea how much @xmath431 increases over this range  how much space there is between the non - vacuum regions .",
    "in other words , in such a range , neither @xmath432 nor @xmath16 provides a useable definition of @xmath32 in terms of a physical quantity .",
    "2 .   specify @xmath433 + in which case @xmath434 now where @xmath435 , @xmath436 will be different for each @xmath13 value , and therefore can be used to identify corresponding points on the two profiles .",
    "we can then use @xmath172 or @xmath128 ( or something else ) as the coordinate radius @xmath32 .",
    "let us say we choose @xmath437 .",
    "but for regions where @xmath438 , @xmath436 will be degenerate . in this case , we take advantage of the fact that in vacuum there are no matter particles , and so we have extra freedom in choosing the geodesics that constitute our constant @xmath32 paths . using a linear interpolation between the @xmath13 values at the two edges of the vacuum region at each of @xmath7 & @xmath75 provides the obvious choice of corresponding points , i.e. at time @xmath75 , @xmath439 and at time @xmath7 , + @xmath440 + the original procedure for extracting the functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which actually used @xmath128 & @xmath172 , goes through with the only change that functions of @xmath441 are now functions of @xmath437 . in particular , in vacuum regions ,",
    "each worldline has different pairs of @xmath128 & @xmath172 values , but the same @xmath3 value .",
    "let us take the relation between @xmath13 and @xmath48 in the most general case , without any assumptions , eq .",
