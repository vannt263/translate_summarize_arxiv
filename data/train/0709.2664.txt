    "numbers play a basic role in physics and mathematics , so basic in fact that their use , both in experiments and in theory , is taken for granted and is rarely examined . natural numbers and integers",
    "are probably the most basic because of their role in counting , rational numbers play a basic role in that numerical experimental outputs are represented as rational numbers .",
    "they also are the type of numbers used in all computer computations .",
    "the importance of real and complex numbers lies in their being the number base of all physical theories used so far .",
    "this includes classical and quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , qed , qcd , string theory , and special and general relativity .",
    "each of these theories is a mathematical theory characterized by a different set of axioms . assuming the axiom sets are consistent , each theory has many different representations as mathematical structures based on the real and complex numbers .",
    "the connection to physics is made by interpreting some of the elements in the mathematical structures as representing physical systems and physical quantities .",
    "examples include the use , in quantum theory , of elements of hilbert spaces and operators on the spaces to represent states and observable physical quantities of systems , the use of other elements , to represent various properties of space time , etc .",
    "in all of this , the tacit assumption is made that the properties of physical systems and the physical universe are independent of the properties of mathematical theories and their representations .",
    "the general approach taken is to discover the theory that best describes physical systems and their properties .",
    "little attention is paid to whether the basic properties of theories and their mathematical representations have any influence on the basic properties of physical systems or how intertwined physics and mathematics are .",
    "the approach taken in this paper stems from the work of wigner on the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences @xcite .",
    "one answer to this problem is that one should work towards developing a coherent theory of mathematics and physics together @xcite .",
    "presumably such a theory would show why mathematics is important to physics .",
    "this paper is , hopefully , a step in this direction .",
    "here extension of previous work on the quantum representation of numbers @xcite shows that quantum theory representations of real and complex numbers have properties not possessed by classical representations of these numbers .",
    "it will be seen that the structures resulting from these properties suggest a close intertwining between the properties of physical and mathematical systems .",
    "although little investigated , these possibilities are not new .",
    "perhaps the closest is the work of tegmark @xcite which suggests that the physical universe really is a mathematical structure .",
    "other work which emphasizes the close relationship between physics and mathematics is concerned with quantum theory representations of mathematical systems .",
    "this work includes papers on quantum set theory @xcite , quantum theory representations of real numbers @xcite , and the use of category theory in physics @xcite .",
    "the quantum representations of real and complex numbers presented here differ from other work in this area in that they are not abstract representations based on quantum logic or on lattice valued models of set theory @xcite , nonstandard numbers @xcite , or category theory @xcite .",
    "instead they are based on representations of natural numbers , @xmath6 , integers , @xmath7 , and rational numbers , @xmath8 , as states of finite strings of qukits .",
    "dimensional hilbert space . ]    this choice is based on the observation that all physical representations of numbers are in the form of k - ary representations as states of strings of kits or of qukits .",
    "this is the case for all experimental outputs .",
    "also all computations are based on these representations of numbers .",
    "the importance of this type of number for computations and the limits of computation suggest other ties to information theory and limitations on the information resources of the universe @xcite .",
    "the restriction here to qukit strings is based on the fact that quantum theory is the basic underlying theory of all physical systems .    here",
    "the quantum theory representations of real numbers are described as equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of states of qukit strings .",
    "in essence this is a translation of the definition in mathematical analysis textbooks @xcite as equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of rational numbers into quantum theory .",
    "these representations are described in the next two sections .",
    "first quantum representations of natural numbers , integers , and rational numbers are presented as states of single finite qukit strings .",
    "these are based on the states of each qukit as elements of a @xmath1 dimensional hilbert space .",
    "these are used in the quantum representations of real numbers as equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of states of single finite qukit strings .",
    "quantum representations of real and complex numbers differ from classical representations in several ways .",
    "one difference is that the equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of qukit string states are larger than classical classes as they contain sequences that do not correspond to any classical sequence .",
    "however , no new equivalence classes are created .",
    "a more important difference is that , for states of qukit strings , there is a freedom of basis state choice that does not exist in classical representations .",
    "this is based on the observation that the states of each qukit are elements of a @xmath1 dimensional hilbert space . in order",
    "that states of qukits , @xmath9 represent numbers , one must choose a basis set of states for each @xmath2 in the string .",
    "this is well known in quantum computation where binary representations of numbers , such as @xmath10 as a state of a qubit string , imply a choice of basis for each qubit .",
    "this freedom of basis choice is also referred to here as a gauge freedom or freedom to fix a gauge for each @xmath2 .",
    "it is represented here by a variable @xmath11 that ranges over all basis or gauge choices for @xmath2 states in a string .",
    "this gauge freedom is seen to extend up to representations of real numbers in that for each gauge choice @xmath11 one has quantum theory representations @xmath12 of real numbers that are different for different @xmath1 and @xmath11 .",
    "even though these representations are @xmath13 dependent , they are all isomorphic to one another .    these representations for different @xmath1 and @xmath11 are described in section [ srnrat ] .",
    "both base changing transformations and gauge transformations are described for the finite @xmath2 string states . lifting these up to transformations on the cauchy sequences gives transformations that take one real number representation to another , @xmath14    the description",
    "is extended to include quantum theory representations of complex numbers , @xmath15 in section [ qrcn ] .",
    "they are defined as equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of states of pairs of finite @xmath2 strings where the pair elements correspond to real and imaginary parts of a complex rational number .",
    "cauchy conditions are applied separately to the sequences of real and imaginary components .",
    "there is another very important difference between quantum and classical representations of real and complex numbers .",
    "this is the fact that the states of the @xmath2 strings used to define cauchy sequences are elements of a fock space that is itself a vector space over a field of real and complex numbers .",
    "for example all eigenvalues of operators acting on these string states are complex or real numbers .",
    "also all linear superposition coefficients are complex numbers .",
    "this is quite different from the classical situation in that real and complex numbers play no role in the representation of numbers as states of bit or kit strings .",
    "this dependence of quantum theory representations on the real and complex number base of spaces of @xmath2 string states leads to the possibility of iteration of the construction .",
    "each representation @xmath16 can serve as the real and complex number base of hilbert space and fock space representations of @xmath2 string states that can be used to construct other representations of the real and complex numbers .",
    "in addition , this same iteration possibility extends to all physical theories that are representable as mathematical structures over the real and complex numbers .",
    "included are quantum and classical mechanics , quantum field theory , special and general relativity , string theory , as well as other theories .",
    "this leads to the association of a reference frame @xmath17 to each representation @xmath18 each frame @xmath17 contains representations of all physical theories as mathematical structures based on @xmath18 this use of reference frame terminology is consistent with other uses @xcite in that it sets a base or reference point @xmath19 for representations of all physical theories .",
    "much of the rest of the paper , section [ fqrf ] , is concerned with properties of these reference frames and with three dimensional fields of these reference frames .",
    "two of the dimensions are labeled by @xmath1 and @xmath11 .",
    "the third is by an integer @xmath20 denoting the iteration stage .",
    "different iteration possibilities are considered : , finite , one way infinite , two way infinite , and cyclic .",
    "also properties of observers in different locations in the frame field are described .",
    "section [ ip ] includes a discussion on what is probably the most important outstanding issue , how to integrate the frame field with physics .",
    "this is especially important from the viewpoint of constructing a coherent theory of physics and mathematics together @xcite or if one considers the physical universe as a mathematical universe @xcite .",
    "both relatively simple aspects of the possible integration , and more speculative aspects are described .",
    "however it is clear from this that much remains to be done to achieve an integration with physics .",
    "the discussion section includes a description of the possible replacement of cauchy sequences by operators , a possible use of gauge theory to integrate this work with physics , and other issues .",
    "two aspects of the following work should be emphasized .",
    "one is that rational numbers are represented by states of _ single _ qubit strings and not by states of pairs of qubit strings .",
    "this is based on the observation that all physical representations of rational numbers , such as computer inputs and outputs , outcomes of measurements , physical constants , etc .",
    "are as single strings of digits in some base @xmath21 ( usually @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) and not as integer pairs . also complex numbers are represented in computations by pairs of finite digit strings in some base where the pair elements correspond to the real and imaginary components .",
    "the use of this representation is based on the fact that sets of rational numbers so represented are dense in the sets of all rational and all real numbers .    in this paper",
    "basic arithmetic relations and operations for the different types of numbers are discussed .",
    "the reason for this is based on the observation that states of kit or qukit strings , such as @xmath24 for @xmath25 , do not , in any ab initio sense , represent numbers of any type . in order to show that these states represent numbers",
    ", one must prove that they satisfy a relevant set of axioms .",
    "the axioms are expressed in terms of properties of basic arithmetic relations and operations .",
    "it follows that a proof that sets of states of finite @xmath2 strings represent numbers is based on showing that definitions of these relations and operations satisfy the relevant axiom sets .",
    "some details of these proofs , which are based on classical proofs , @xcite , are given in @xcite .",
    "the quantum representations of numbers are described here by states of strings of qukits on a two dimensional integer lattice , @xmath26 .",
    "the states are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a @xmath29 valued function on an interval @xmath30 $ ] of @xmath31 with @xmath32 @xmath33 denotes the sign , and @xmath34 the lattice location of the @xmath35 point .",
    "the reason for the subscript @xmath11 will be clarified later on .",
    "here it is intended that the states @xmath27 represent numbers in @xmath36 and @xmath37 for numbers in @xmath38 @xmath39 ; for numbers in @xmath7 , @xmath40 and there are no restrictions for @xmath37 a compact notation is used where the location of the sign , denoted by @xmath34 , is also the location of the @xmath35 point . as examples , the base @xmath23 numbers @xmath41 are represented here by @xmath42 respectively .",
    "note that leading and trailing @xmath43 are allowed .",
    "the states @xmath27 can be represented in terms of creation operators acting on the qukit vacuum state @xmath44 where @xmath45 here @xmath46 creates a sign qubit at @xmath47 and @xmath48 creates a qukit in state @xmath49 at @xmath50 @xmath51 is a short representation of the string of @xmath52 operators .",
    "the creation operators and the corresponding annihilation operators satisfy the usual commutation or anticommutation rules for respective boson or fermion qukits .",
    "the variable @xmath53 is present to allow for the presence of @xmath54 of @xmath2 string states representing @xmath54 of numbers .",
    "the use of @xmath26 as a framework for qukit state representations is based on the need to distinguish qukits in a string by a discrete ordering parameter and to distinguish different qukit strings from one another .",
    "this is seen in eq .",
    "[ g0hs ] where the integers @xmath20 with @xmath55 order the qukits in a string and the values of @xmath53 serve to distinguish different strings .",
    "there is no need to consider @xmath26 as a lattice of points in a two dimensional physical space as its sole function is to provide discrete ordering and distinguishing labels .",
    "also the locations of the qukit strings in the lattice direction of the strings will be restricted in that the sign qubit will always be at site @xmath56 .",
    "this restriction is inessential because the only function of the @xmath20 label in @xmath57 is to provide a discrete ordering of qukits states in a string .",
    "the set of states @xmath27 for all @xmath58 are a basis , @xmath59 that spans a fock space @xmath60 of states that are linear superpositions @xmath61 here and in the following , @xmath62}}$ ] is a sum over all integer intervals @xmath63 $ ] and over all @xmath29 valued functions @xmath28 with domain @xmath63.$ ] a fock space is used because states of @xmath2 strings with different numbers of qukits are included .",
    "the subscript @xmath21 denotes the base .",
    "note that base @xmath1 qukits are different from base @xmath64 qukits just as spin @xmath1 systems are different from spin @xmath64 systems .",
    "extension of the description to include pairs , triples and @xmath54 of basis states and their linear superpositions is done by distinguishing different states in the tuples with different values of @xmath53 .",
    "for each finite subset @xmath65 of integers where @xmath66 is the number of integers in @xmath67 , let @xmath68 be the set of states of the form @xmath69 define @xmath70 by@xmath71 @xmath70 is a basis set of all finite tuples of states of finite @xmath2 strings .",

    "the usefulness of this operation is that the other arithmetic operations can be defined in terms of it .",

    "these are not usually considered , because basic arithmetic operations on these numbers are exponentially hard .",
    "for instance the number of steps needed to add two unary numbers is proportional to the values of the numbers and not to the logarithms of the values .",
    "however , even though they are not used arithmetically , they are always present in an interesting way .    to see this one notes that @xmath215 representations are the only ones that are extensive , all others are representational .",
    "the representational property for @xmath21 base states of a qukit string means that a number represented by a state has nothing to do with the properties of the string state .",
    "the number represented by the state , @xmath216 of a string of @xmath5 @xmath217 is unrelated to the properties of the qukits in the state .",
    "the extensiveness of a unary representation means that any collection of systems is an unary representation of a number that is the number of systems in the collection .",
    "there are many examples .",
    "a system of spins on a lattice is an unary representation of a number , that is the number of spins in the system .",

    "a single qukit is an unary representation of the number @xmath218 .",
    "the omnipresence of unary representations relates to another observation that @xmath218 is the only number that is a common factor of all prime numbers and of all numbers .",
    "so it is present as a factor of any base .",
    "this ties in with the fact that unary representations of numbers are possible only for natural numbers and integers .",
    "also there is the related observation that , for any pair @xmath219 the domain and range of @xmath146 include the integer subspaces of @xmath72 and @xmath220 and if @xmath196 have no prime factors in common , @xmath72 and @xmath221 are the domain and range of @xmath193    the extensiveness of unary representations supports the inclusion of the @xmath222 factor in the definition of @xmath148 as a @xmath223 valued function on @xmath150 as a very simple example , a state @xmath224 of a qukit at location @xmath225 is an unary representation of the number @xmath218 .",

    "one may hope that elucidation of this relationship will provide a good foundation to theoretical physics .",
    "it also may help to decide which of the different competing theories of quantum gravity , such as loop quantum gravity @xcite and string theory @xcite , is correct .",
    "there are some simple ways the work presented here is related to physics .",
    "they are called simple only because it is not clear if they would influence the properties of physical theories or affect physics .",
    "one of these , which was noted earlier , is that the choice of number representations as states of single finite @xmath2 strings is based on the universality of quantum mechanics as a description of physical systems . also influencing the choice is the fact that all physical representations of numbers are as states of finite strings of physical systems .",
    "the important role that real and complex numbers have in physics should also be stressed .",
    "all theoretical predictions of physical properties of systems are in the form of real numbers as values of physical properties .",
    "also dimensionless constants are presumed to be real numbers .",
    "complex numbers occur as expansion coefficients of superposition states of physical systems and as elements in matrix representations of operators .",
    "translation of this into the frame field described here has consequences of how the numbers used by physical theories in a frame are seen by observers in different frames .",
    "for example an observer @xmath574 in frame @xmath572 sees the real and complex numbers , @xmath585 as external featureless objects with no properties other than those derived from the real and complex number axioms .",
    "any other properties they may have are not visible to @xmath586    it follows that , from @xmath587 viewpoint , all values of physical quantities described or predicted by physical theory representations , as mathematical structures based on @xmath588 have the same property to @xmath574 .",
    "this applies to both dimensionless physical quantities such as the fine structure constant and dimensioned quantities such as values of spatial position , distance , momentum , energy , all elements of the spectrum of observables , values of the metric tensor @xmath589 , etc .",
    "however an observer @xmath590 in a parent frame @xmath582 where @xmath591 sees all elements of @xmath592 as equivalence classes of states of finite @xmath2 strings . as",
    "a result @xmath590 also sees that all physical quantities described by theories in @xmath572 are equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of @xmath2 string states . to summarize , what @xmath574 sees as elementary featureless objects ,",
    "are seen by @xmath590 as equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of states of @xmath2 strings .",
    "the same holds for representations of all complex valued physical quantities , such as elements of matrices representing physical transformations , and quantum state expansion coefficients .",
    "these quantities in frame @xmath572 are seen by @xmath590 in @xmath582 as equivalence classes of pairs of qukit string states .    in general , all these results on how the values of physical quantities are seen depends on the relation between the frame containing the representations of these quantities and the viewing frame of an observer .",
    "they all follow from the observations that in each frame all physical theories are represented as mathematical structures based on the real and complex number base of the frame .",
    "how these numbers are seen depends on the relation between the frame based on these numbers and the viewing frame .",
    "because of much interest in quantum gravity and associated structure of space and time @xcite , it is worthwhile to consider how a representation of space time and its properties in one frame are viewed from a parent frame . as would be expected , real number values of all physical properties of space and time , which are featureless and elementary in one frame , are viewed as equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of states of finite @xmath2 strings from a parent frame .",
    "this applies to distances , angles , coordinate positions , and to values of the metric tensor @xmath593 .",
    "it also applies to matrix representations of space time transformations from one inertial frame to another .",
    "in addition , if one regards the points of the space time manifold as @xmath594 @xmath595 of the real numbers , then the same arguments hold . in this case",
    "an observer in frame @xmath572 sees the points of his own space time manifold , @xmath596 as @xmath597 of elementary , featureless points whereas an observer @xmath590 in a parent frame @xmath582 sees the points of @xmath596 as @xmath597 of equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of @xmath2 string states . to @xmath590 the space time points in @xmath572 are not featureless as they have structure .",
    "this description of how observers describe space time representations in different frames is valid only if one describes the space time manifold as a @xmath598-tuple of real numbers . for other descriptions , such as discrete space times or space time foams @xcite or space represented by spin networks @xcite ,",
    "it is not clear if a similar description applies that is based on the relation between the viewing and representation frames .",
    "another aspect of integrating the frame field with physics is that there is no hint of the frame field structure in the properties of the observed physical universe .",
    "this suggests that one should perhaps find some way to collapse the field structure , or at least make the different reference frames appear to be `` the same '' in some sense .",
    "this suggests that one should require that the physical properties of systems represented by frame field elements are frame invariant .",
    "that is , they are invariant under transformations from one frame to another .",
    "one step in this direction is to require that the field structure be such that all frames are equivalent .",
    "this would restrict the iteration types to the two way infinite and finite circular ones as they do not have an ancestor frame that is different ( from the viewpoint of outside the frame field ) from the other reference frames .",
    "it also seems appropriate to restrict consideration to the finite cyclic iteration field type , as one way to move toward frame invariance is to reduce the size of the frame field .",
    "the ultimate step in this direction is to reduce the number of iteration stages in a cycle to just one . whether this is possible or not will have to await future work .",
    "another approach to reduce the frame field is to eliminate the gauge dimension entirely by requiring the states of the individual @xmath2 to be invariant under any basis change .",
    "this can be achieved by letting the @xmath56 and @xmath218 states of each @xmath2 be represented by different irreducible representations of the gauge group @xmath599 one method @xcite involves constructing new qukits from the old ones by reducing the product @xmath600 into a sum of irreducible representations and choosing any two representations to represent the @xmath356 states of each new @xmath2 .",
    "another method @xcite uses transformations on the @xmath601 group manifold to construct irreducible representations of the group that are invariant under the transformations .",
    "in essence this is the method used to construct angular momentum state subspaces labeled by different values of @xmath602 that are invariant under rotations as transformations on @xmath603      so far the approaches to integrating the frame field and quantum representations of real and complex numbers with physics are rather superficial .",
    "they do not represent a real integration that treats both physical and mathematical systems together in a coherent way .",
    "how one does this is quite open at present .",
    "however one may speculate about various methods to achieve this .",
    "one possible way is based on noting that , as units of quantum information , the qukits be considered to be fundamental objects that can represent either components of numbers or physical systems . whether it represents a number component ( digit ) or a physical system would depend on how it is viewed .",
    "the details of this would have to be worked out to see if it has merit .",
    "however , it is worth noting that this type of dependence already occurs elsewhere in physics , such as the wave - particle and other types of duality . also the suggestion that one consider the prime number qukits as elementary and the others as composites , may fit in here . in particular the observation is intriguing that",
    ", if the prime numbers @xmath271 are related to particle spin by @xmath604 there is just one fermion for @xmath605 all the rest are bosons .",
    "another approach to constructing a coherent integration with physics is based on the observation that physical theory representations have been inserted into each frame of a completed frame field as mathematical structures based on the real and complex number base of the frame . instead",
    "one may consider involving physical theories in the process of constructing cauchy sequences , their use to represent real and complex numbers , and in properties of the frame field .    in this way",
    "physical theories may have input into constructing their real and complex number bases and , conversely , the process of constructing sequences and imposing the cauchy condition may influence the properties of the physical theories whose base is being constructed .",
    "it is even possible that the restrictions imposed by this interlocking process may influence the physical predictions that the theories can make .",
    "it would seem that this approach might be most fruitful in applying it to the cyclic frame fields and possibly those with a very few elements in a cycle .",
    "one may speculate that the process of closing the cyclic fields imposes restrictions on the physical theories and numbers involved that influences the values of fundamental constants in the theories or predicted values of physical quantities .",
    "another approach to integrating this work with physics is based on the possible representation of a sequence @xmath274 as a @xmath70 or , more generally , as an @xmath72 valued quantum field on the nonnegative integers .",
    "then the states of the field at each @xmath185 are given by @xmath456 attention is then restricted to those fields that satisfy the cauchy condition , i.e. the cauchy fields .",
    "as was seen , one of the degrees of freedom in representing these fields is the freedom of gauge or basis choice .",
    "changes in gauge are implemented by gauge transformations acting on the fields as shown in eq .",
    "[ umathcal ] , or @xmath606",
    "this raises the possibility of using the well developed techniques of gauge theories for these fields .",
    "for example , one requires that the axioms for the type of numbers being described must be invariant under any gauge transformation .",
    "yet it is clear from their expression in any particular gauge that their expressions transform covariantly under any gauge transformation .",
    "the same holds for the expression of the cauchy condition .",
    "this is , ultimately , a consequence of the gauge dependence shown in eqs .",
    "[ opuu ] and [ reuu ] .",
    "one should note that the invariance of the axioms of number theories under gauge transformations also applies to the axioms for any physical theory .",
    "the importance of this is stems from the fact that all physical theories have axioms , whether they are implicit or explicitly stated . without axioms ,",
    "theories are empty as nothing can be derived or predicted .    for",
    "the gauge theory approach one can ask if there is any way to express an action or type of lagrangian whose invariance under gauge transformations expresses the invariance of the axioms for numbers and for physical theories . if so it may be one way to work towards integrating the results obtained here with physics .",
    "there is an intriguing connection of this approach to the standard model in physics @xcite .",
    "this model is a gauge theory where invariance of the lagrangian under gauge transformations requires the introduction of fields for the electromagnetic , weak , and strong forces .",
    "the invariance is under all gauge transformations in the group @xmath607    the connection of the standard model to the gauge theory approach to axiom invariance noted above is based on the earlier suggestion that prime number qukits ( those whose base @xmath1 is a prime number ) are elementary and the others are composites .",
    "here invariance is under all gauge transformations in @xmath608 the first three groups in the product are the same as those for the standard model . whether or not the product of groups @xmath270 has to include components for all prime numbers or can be cut off is not known at present .",
    "it is not clear if this , or any other speculative approach , will work out .",
    "however , these possibilities indicate that there is much work needed to integrate quantum theory representations of numbers and the resulting frame field with physics .",
    "there are some other aspects of this work that should be noted .",
    "one is that representation of gauge transformations by one continuous dimension of the frame fields , as in figs .",
    "[ fiq1]-[fiq4 ] , is purely schematic .",
    "nothing is implied about what it means for one gauge @xmath11 to be close to or far away from another .",
    "indeed it may not be useful or even possible to assign a distance measure to the set of gauges .",
    "is a function from @xmath26 to a basis set for a @xmath1 dimensional hilbert space associated with each element of @xmath150 ]    in this connection one should note that the choice of basis sets @xmath70 and @xmath475 in the spaces @xmath72 and @xmath221 is completely arbitrary .",
    "and @xmath475 are each a set of states of all finite tuples of states of finite length qukit strings for bases @xmath1 and @xmath64 .",
    "] there is no way to determine if the @xmath11 for the @xmath441 strings is the same or different than the @xmath11 for the @xmath2 strings .",
    "this is different from the usual situation in physics .",
    "there one has an external reference field or frame that can be used to define what it means for a basis of @xmath1 dimensional systems to be the same or different from a basis of @xmath64 dimensional systems . here",
    "no such field or common reference frame is present .    in spite of this",
    "the two basis sets can be connected by the base changing operator @xmath146 defined earlier . recall that if the state @xmath204 is in the domain of @xmath173 then the state @xmath610 represents the same number in base @xmath64 as @xmath204 does in base @xmath1 .",
    "this shows that one can proceed in two ways : arbitrarily choose both @xmath70 and @xmath475 and define @xmath146 to be a map from @xmath70 to @xmath611 alternatively choose @xmath70 and a definition of @xmath146 and let @xmath475 be the range set of @xmath193    these methods work only if @xmath1 and @xmath64 have the same prime factors .",
    "if this is not the case , one can extend the definition of @xmath146 by use of definitions to accuracy @xmath612 much as was done for the division operator .",
    "there is another quantum theory representation of real and complex numbers that is based on operators instead of sequences of states of @xmath2 strings . to define these operators",
    "one replaces the natural number domain of sequences @xmath274 by states of finite @xmath2 strings that represent natural numbers . in this way",
    "the sequences @xmath274 become quantum operators @xmath516 where @xmath613 here @xmath614 denotes a qukit string state @xmath615 in @xmath70 that represents the number @xmath185 in base @xmath1 .",
    "is assumed to be a state with no leading or trailing @xmath85 this can easily be relaxed , if desired . ]",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ seqop ] holds irrespective of whether @xmath274 is a @xmath70 valued or a more general @xmath72 valued sequence .",
    "one can use eq .",
    "[ seqop ] to replace state sequences by operators .",
    "the definition of the cauchy condition can be changed to apply to these operators by quantifying over the states @xmath614 as natural number representations and replacing the state @xmath616 in eq .",
    "[ cauchy ] by @xmath617 and the state @xmath618 in eq .",
    "[ pjml ] by @xmath619 similar replacements are made for @xmath620 and @xmath621 operators that satisfy the relevant cauchy condition are denoted here as cauchy operators .",
    "the rest of the definition of quantum theory representations of real and complex numbers can be taken over to define representations as equivalence classes of cauchy operators . in that case there",
    "does not seem to be a reason why one could not extend the frame field description to apply to cauchy operators .",
    "an observer in a frame would see real valued physical quantities in an immediate descendant frame as equivalence classes of cauchy operators .",
    "it is clear that there is much to do , both in understanding the representations of theories in the frame fields and in integrating this work with physics . in any case",
    "it is seen that quantum representations of real and complex numbers as equivalence classes of cauchy sequences of states of qukit strings are different from the usual classical representations .",
    "not only are the quantum equivalence classes larger than the classical ones but the space of representations enjoys two degrees of freedom not present in the space of classical representations .",
    "these are the gauge freedom and the iteration stage freedom .",
