    "the contact structure @xmath2 is said to be supported by an open book @xmath5 if @xmath2 is the kernel of a one - form @xmath6 such that @xmath6 evaluates positively on the positively oriented tangent vectors of @xmath4 and @xmath7 restricts to a positive area form on each fibre of @xmath5 .",
    "the fibres of @xmath5 are called _ pages _ of the open book",
    ". we will consider abstract open books @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a page of the open book , and @xmath10 .",
    "it is easy to construct an open book as above , starting from the data @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that every contact structure @xmath2 is supported by an open book on @xmath1 and all open book decompositions of @xmath1 supporting @xmath2 are equivalent up to positive stabilizations and destabilizations @xcite . in light of this theorem , to study contact structures , we will study abstract open books @xmath8 supporting them .",
    "we should note that in our case the right notion of equivalence provided by the giroux s theorem is contact isomorphism ( not contact isotopy , see @xcite ) .    in @xcite",
    ", etnyre proved that every overtwisted contact structure is supported by a planar open book . on the other hand ,",

    "we recall these here : @xmath13",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is any point in @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the genus , and @xmath19 is the number of components .    these are called _ support norm , support genus _ and _ binding number _ in the order given above .",
    "in general , it is hard to compute these invariants for a given @xmath2 . from the above definition",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath20 , however it is known that in general these invariants are independent of each other ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this article",
    ", we will determine all of these invariants for all the contact structures on @xmath0 .",

    "it is easy to show that this is supported by the open book @xmath25 , hence @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the tight contact structure on @xmath0 . the overtwisted contact structures on @xmath0 are classified by their @xmath29 invariants which takes values in @xmath30",
    ". we will write @xmath31 for the overtwisted contact structure on @xmath0 with @xmath32 .",
    "our first result determines the invariant of these :    [ theorem1 ] let @xmath31 be the overtwisted contact structure on @xmath0 with @xmath33 , then @xmath34 for all @xmath35,@xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41    note that the results for @xmath42 were calculated by @xmath12 via an easy classification of planar open books with three or less boundary components , which we review here .",
    "let @xmath11 be the contact three - manifold supported by @xmath8 .",
    "below , we write @xmath43 to denote the unique tight contact structure on @xmath1 whenever @xmath1 has a unique tight contact structure . these descriptions and more can be found in @xcite .    * if @xmath44 , then @xmath45 and @xmath46 . * for @xmath47 $ ] , let @xmath48 denote the simple closed curve generating @xmath49 . if @xmath50 , then @xmath51 for @xmath52 , @xmath53 for @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for @xmath56 , where @xmath2 is overtwisted with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "note that @xmath0 appears exactly for @xmath59 . for @xmath60",
    ", this is a stabilization of the standard open book of tight contact structure in @xmath0 , and for @xmath61 , we get the overtwisted contact structure @xmath62 . *",

    "we only note that it is easy to draw a contact surgery diagram of these contact structures @xcite .",
    "the authors calculate exactly when @xmath0 has such an open book , it turns out all of these open books support either @xmath67 or @xmath68 .    to determine @xmath69 for the remaining cases , we simply construct planar open books with four binding components supporting @xmath31 for the remaining cases .",
    "this determines @xmath69 . to calculate @xmath70 ,",
    "we show that none of these contact structures can be supported by an open book with page a torus with one boundary component .        in @xcite ,",
    "honda , kazez and mati proves that a contact structure @xmath2 is tight if and only if all of the open book decompositions @xmath8 supporting @xmath2 have right - veering monodromy @xmath71 .",
    "this result is useful in proving that @xmath2 is overtwisted by exhibiting a supporting open book with a monodromy which is not a right - veering diffeomorphism . on the other hand , when @xmath9 is a punctured torus , the same authors in @xcite also prove that the supported contact structure is tight if and only if the _ given _ monodromy is right - veering . in general , however a right - veering diffeomorphism does not always correspond to a tight contact structure .",
    "in fact , any open book can be stabilized to a right - veering one .",
    "however , honda , kazez and mati optimistically conjecture that if the monodromy is given by a right veering diffeomorphism that does not admit a destabilization ( in the sense of giroux stabilization ) then the supported contact structure is tight .",
    "our next result gives a counterexample to this conjecture :    [ theorem2 ] there exists an open book @xmath8 on the poincar homology sphere @xmath72 where @xmath9 is a four - holed sphere and @xmath73 which is right - veering and not destabilizable such that the supported contact structure is an overtwisted contact structure .",
    "of independent interest , we also prove the following characterization concerning positive factorizations of a family of elements in the mapping class group of four - holed sphere .",
    "we denote by @xmath74 the ozsvth - szab contact invariant of the contact structure supported by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the four - holed sphere .",
    "[ theorem3 ] let @xmath75 , then @xmath76 admits a positive factorization if and only if @xmath77 . furthermore",
    ", this latter condition is satisfied if and only if @xmath78 .",
    "note that the results of @xcite and @xcite together with the above proposition imply that the contact structure supported by @xmath79 admits a stein filling ( or equivalently a weak - symplectic filling ) if and only if @xmath77 . an interesting question left open is whether all non - fillable contact structures in the class of monodromies considered above are overtwisted .",
    "note that one can easily show that some monodromies give overtwisted contact structures by showing that they are not right - veering , however theorem [ theorem2 ] shows that right - veering restriction by itself is not enough to answer this question .",
    "we pause here to declare our conventions for the rest of the paper .",
    "we denote by @xmath80 a right handed dehn twist around the curve @xmath48 .",
    "we will adhere to braid notation for compositions : @xmath81 means applying a right handed dehn twist around @xmath48 first and then a right handed dehn twist around @xmath63 .",
    "we will also use the following conventions for braid groups : our braids will be drawn from top to bottom with the strands numbered @xmath82 from left to right .",
    "the convention for positive and negative half twist is as shown below .",
    "we first recall a classical proposition relating the mapping class group of a @xmath35-holed disk with dehn surgery on pure braids ( see for example @xcite for more than presented here ) .",
    "let @xmath76 be a diffeomorphism of the @xmath35-holed disk , identity on the boundary .",
    "this diffeomorphism can be extended to a diffeomorphism @xmath83 of the disk simply by extending @xmath76 by identity .",
    "since any diffeomorphism of the disk identical on the boundary is isotopic to identity , there exists an isotopy @xmath84 such that @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath87 be points in the disks that fills the holes , then we obtain a pure braid @xmath88 by considering the union of arcs @xmath89 in @xmath90 $ ] , @xmath91 $ ] ( see figure [ figure4 ] for an example ) .",
    "this pure braid almost captures the whole @xmath76 , except @xmath76 can have extra boundary twists around the holes .",
    "we summarize this in the proposition below .",
    "let @xmath92 denote the @xmath35 holed disk , and @xmath93 be the mapping class group of diffeomorphisms which are identical on the boundary .",
    "let @xmath94 be the pure braid group on @xmath35 strands .",
    "[ braid ] @xmath95        note that @xmath35-holed disk is topologically the same as @xmath96-holed sphere , however the above isomorphism is meaningful only after choosing a boundary component of the @xmath96-holed sphere to be identified with the boundary of @xmath97 after filling in the other boundary components with disks .",
    "nevertheless , such a choice can be made once and for all . by looking at figure [ figure2 ]",
    ", we choose the boundary component parallel to the curve @xmath98 to correspond to the boundary of @xmath97 , and the pure braid will be obtained by filling the boundary components parallel to the curves @xmath48 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , in addition we choose the ordering of the strands of the pure braid in this order .",
    "this proposition gives us an alternative way to describe the underlying topological manifold supported by an open book @xmath99 .",
    "namely if @xmath1 has an open book @xmath99 , then @xmath1 is obtained by dehn surgery on the braid closure @xmath100 of the braid @xmath88 with surgery coefficients determined by the above isomorphism .    in this article , we study planar open books with four binding components . for the sake of explicitness",
    ", we give a more precise statement of the above discussion for this case .",
    "let @xmath101 denote a four - holed sphere , the mapping class group @xmath102 is not a free abelian group in contrast to the case three - holed sphere , in particular it has a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath103 , the free group on two generators , generated by dehn twists around @xmath104 and @xmath105 in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "in fact , it is a classical fact that @xmath102 can be seen as a direct product @xmath106 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we can see this as follows : because of proposition [ braid ] , it suffices to see that @xmath107 is @xmath108 . recall that @xmath107 is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the space of triples of distinct points on the plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "consider the forgetful map , from @xmath109 , given by forgetting about the middle strand .",
    "@xmath110 is @xmath111 and the kernel of this map is @xmath112 , which is @xmath103 .",
    "thus we have a short exact sequence : @xmath113 where the kernel is generated by @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and the image is generated by the central element @xmath116 which corresponds to a full right - handed twist of the three - strands .",
    "therefore , any pure 3-braid is expressed uniquely as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 are integers .",
    "therefore , under the identification of proposition [ braid ] any mapping class @xmath119 can be represented by : @xmath120    and such representation is unique .    here",
    "@xmath76 is identified with the pure braid @xmath121 , and the integers @xmath122 . for such open books",
    ", we have the following proposition as part of the general discussion above :    [ surgery ] let @xmath9 be the four - holed sphere and @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "then the topological manifold @xmath1 given by the open book @xmath8 can be obtained by dehn surgery on the braid closure of the pure three braid @xmath126 , with surgery coefficients @xmath127 .",
    "we would like to construct planar open books with four boundary components on @xmath0",
    ". we will look for planar open books with simple monodoromy of the form @xmath128 . in light of proposition [ surgery ] , we would like to know when a surgery on a braid closure of a pure three - braid of the form @xmath129 yields @xmath0 .",
    "fortunately , this question is completely resolved by armas - sanabria and eudave - mu@xmath130 oz in @xcite by depending on deep results on dehn surgery on knots .",
    "in particular , the authors list several infinite families .",
    "therefore , we can describe precisely when an open book @xmath131 is an open book on @xmath0 .    from the list provided in @xcite we pick a convenient family . by using kirby calculus",
    ", we will verify independently that these indeed give @xmath0 , and our next task is to calculate the @xmath29 invariants of the contact structures supported by the corresponding open books .",
    "the difficulty is that we would like to see that any value in @xmath132 can be achieved .",
    "we will apply several tricks to ensure this .",
    "therefore , as a consequence of these calculations , we show that every contact structure on @xmath0 is supported by an open book with a planar page with at most four binding components .",
    "_ proof of theorem [ theorem1 ] : _ we will start with the braid @xmath133 .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] is a picture of the closure of this braid , also known as the chain link .",
    "the hyperbolic structure on its complement was first constructed by thurston in his notes @xcite , and this manifold has been called as the `` magic manifold '' by gordon and wu @xcite @xcite as one gets most of the hyperbolic manifolds and most of the interesting non - hyperbolic fillings of cusped hyperbolic manifolds ( see @xcite for a classification of _ all _ exceptional surgeries on this link ) . it is the smallest known hyperbolic manifold with 3 cusps of smallest known volume and complexity @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see by blowing down twice that @xmath134 surgery on this link yields @xmath0 ( see below for the more general case ) .",
    "therefore , by our proposition [ surgery ] , it follows that the open book with page @xmath9 , a four - holed sphere , and @xmath135 is an open book on @xmath0 when @xmath136    more generally , consider the braid @xmath137 and perform dehn surgery with coefficients @xmath138 . in figure",
    "[ figure6 ] , we verify that we still obtain @xmath0 .    ]    by reflecting ( which amounts to changing orientation ) , we also know that dehn surgery on @xmath139 with coefficients @xmath140 also yields @xmath0 .    after some experimentation",
    ", the author found that the following two families of open books ( which are obtained from one another by reflecting the braid as above ) will be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "( note that reflecting the braid amounts to changing the orientation , but since @xmath0 has an orientation reversing diffeomorphism , this will still give an open book on @xmath0 .",
    "though , as we will see below the supported contact structure will change ! )    it will suffice to consider the following two possibilities : @xmath141 we will denote the supported contact structures by @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "note that in both open books the monodromies have boundary parallel negative dehn twists ,",
    "it is easy to see that in this case , the monodromies are not right - veering . therefore , the supported contact structures are overtwisted .    to determine the contact structures , following the description in @xcite ( see also @xcite )",
    ", we will next compute the @xmath29 invariants of the supported contact structures from the monodoromy data of the open books .",
    "first , we briefly review the strategy , for more details see @xmath12 .",
    "given @xmath76 as a product dehn twists around homologically non - trivial curves @xmath144 on a planar surface @xmath9 with @xmath35 boundary components , one first constructs the stein manifold @xmath145 in a standard way by attaching @xmath35 one - handles to @xmath146 along legendrian unknots , then one attaches @xmath147-handles along legendrian realizations of @xmath148 on @xmath9 with @xmath149 framing depending on whether the dehn twist around @xmath148 is negative or positive .",
    "let @xmath150 be thus constructed @xmath151-manifold , then the contact manifold @xmath11 supported by the open book @xmath8 is the boundary of @xmath150 . as long as @xmath152 ( or more generally a torsion class ) in @xmath153 , @xmath154 is an element of @xmath155 and may be computed by the formula , @xmath156    where @xmath157 is the number of negative dehn twists in the factorization of @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath158 is the square of the class @xmath159 which is poincar dual to the class @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the cocore of the 2-handle attached along @xmath148 and @xmath162 is the rotation number of @xmath148 which can be computed as the winding number of @xmath148 with respect to a standard trivialization of the tangent bundle of the page .",
    "since we assume @xmath152 , @xmath163 maps to zero under the natural map @xmath164 , hence it comes from class in @xmath165 whose square is @xmath158 that appear in the formula above .    now , figure [ figure7 ] is a kirby diagram for the page of a planar open book with four boundary components .",
    "we drew all the curves @xmath166 and @xmath105 that appear in the above monodromies .        in order to compute the rotation numbers",
    ", we chose an orientation of the curves ( note that the computation of @xmath158 is independent of this choice ) .",
    "one then computes the winding numbers of these curves to get : @xmath167 the rest of the proof is a direct homology calculation based on the descriptions above .",
    "+ * computation of @xmath168 and @xmath169 *    let @xmath170 , @xmath1 , and @xmath171 be the @xmath172-handles , which form a basis of @xmath173 .",
    "let @xmath4 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 be the cores of the handles attached corresponding to the factorization @xmath178 . these form",
    "a basis of @xmath179 and the boundary map can be read off the diagram in figure [ figure7 ] to be : @xmath180 thus , @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "it will be convenient to pick the following basis of generators : @xmath183    note that we have @xmath184 and @xmath185 and @xmath186 and any cross term intersection number is zero .",
    "the intersection matrix takes particularly nice form if we add or subtract the first @xmath187 elements in the above basis to the @xmath188 element according to whether @xmath187 is negative or postive .",
    "so , our new basis is given by @xmath189 therefore , the intersection matrix of @xmath150 in the this basis can be calculated to be : @xmath190 from this one can easily compute that @xmath191 , and also we know that @xmath192 . to compute @xmath158 ,",
    "let us denote the cocores by @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 . then from the calculation of rotation numbers it follows that @xmath163 is poincar dual to @xmath198 evaluating @xmath163 on our basis of @xmath199",
    ", we get the vector @xmath200 hence the poincar dual to the pull back of @xmath163 to @xmath165 is given by @xmath201 , which one can calculate to be : @xmath202 hence @xmath203 the number of negative dehn twists is given by @xmath204 .",
    "finally , we compute : @xmath205    this only covers half of the overtwisted contact structures on @xmath0 , to get the other half , we consider @xmath143 .",
    "note , that @xmath143 is obtained by orientation reversal .",
    "therefore , we do not need to compute all the above invariants from scratch .",
    "namely , we have : @xmath206    therefore , we have : @xmath207    we determined the binding number of all the overtwisted contact structures . the proof of theorem [ theorem1 ]",
    "will be completed once we determine the support norm of the overtwisted contact structures .",
    "note that because all of the overtwisted contact structures are supported by a planar open book with page a four - holed sphere , we have that @xmath208 for all @xmath2 .",
    "we also know that if @xmath209 , then @xmath210 , therefore the only way for these contact structures to have support norm strictly less than @xmath147 is when they are supported by an open book with page a torus with one boundary component .",
    "now , recall the well - known fact that the only genus one fibred knots on @xmath0 are trefoil and figure - eight knot and the corresponding open books have monodromy @xmath211 , where @xmath48 and @xmath63 are standard generators of the homology of the torus , ( this follows from for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is now easy to see that @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 are obtained by positively stabilizing the open books with annulus page supporting the unique tight contact structure , and the overtwisted contact structure @xmath62 , and @xmath215 is obtained by negatively stabilizing @xmath62 , hence corresponds to @xmath68 .",

    "we will prove the following proposition :    let @xmath75 , then @xmath76 admits a positive factorization if and only if @xmath77    suppose @xmath228 is a positive factorization in @xmath229 .",
    "we consider the quotient relation in @xmath230 .",
    "@xmath231 \\ldots [ \\tau_{c_k}]\\ ] ] now , by topological classification of surfaces observe that any simple closed curve @xmath161 is conjugate in @xmath102 to one of the curves @xmath232 or @xmath233 in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "the classes of dehn twists around these curves in @xmath234 are given by @xmath235= ( 1,0,0,0,0,0 ) , [ \\tau_b]= ( 0,1,0,0,0,0 ) , [ \\tau_c]=(0,0,1,0,0,0 ) , [ \\tau_d]=(0,0,0,1,0,0 ) , \\tau_e=(0,0,0,0,1,0 ) , [ \\tau_f]= ( 0,0,0,0,0,1)$ ] and @xmath236=(1,1,1,1,-1,-1)$ ] .",
    "for the latter , observe that by the lantern relation we have @xmath237 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath238 to be the vector with @xmath239 coordinate @xmath172 and other coordinates @xmath223 and let @xmath240 .",

    "now , if @xmath76 has positive factorization then @xmath243    for some @xmath244 . thus if @xmath245 or @xmath246 is negative , @xmath247 , which shows that @xmath248 as desired",
    "conversely , if @xmath249 , then the given factorization is positive as long as @xmath250 . without loss of generality ,",
    "suppose next that @xmath251 and @xmath252 for @xmath253 .",
    "we have @xmath254 , set @xmath255 .",
    "then by using the lantern relation @xmath256 times , we obtain the central element @xmath257 .",

    "the expression is equal to @xmath264 so it is positive .",
    "we write @xmath265the latter expression is positive by induction hypothesis , which completes the proof .",
    "in fact , we can simply see that @xmath266    suppose more generally that @xmath226 .",
    "let @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "then the same argument using @xmath234 gives that @xmath76 has a positive factorization only if @xmath269 .",

    "for example , @xmath270 satisfies this condition , but one can check that this is not a right - veering monodoromy hence can not be written as a product of right - handed dehn twists ( by @xcite the supported contact structure can not even be tight ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the argument given in the above proof clearly gives a positive factorization of @xmath76 if @xmath271 .",
    "we next determine whether or not the ozsvth - szab contact invariant vanishes for these contact structures . in our case",
    ", it turns out that this is equivalent to whether or not the contact structure is stein fillable .    let @xmath75 , then the contact invariant @xmath74 is non - zero if and only if @xmath77    let us define @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 the induced monodromies on the three - holed planar surface after one `` caps off '' the boundary components parallel to @xmath48 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 or @xmath98 by gluing a disk to the corresponding boundary component and extending the monodromy by identity on this disk .",

    "as in the previous remark , for the more general class of diffeomorphisms , @xmath285 , the above argument shows that @xmath280 when @xmath286 . however , the converse is not true again by the same example given there , namely @xmath270 has vanishing @xmath280 , since it supports an overtwisted contact structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to point out that this is an overtwisted contact structure on @xmath287 .",
    "once we have the surgery description on pure three - braid closures , it is easy to play around with simple three - braids and surgeries on them to get interesting open book decompositions on various manifolds .",
    "we first verify below that if we do surgery on the closure of this braid with surgery coefficients @xmath289 , then the result is @xmath290 surgery on the left - handed trefoil . by proposition",
    "[ surgery ] , we obtain an open book with page a four - holed sphere and @xmath291 . in particular , the @xmath292 surgery yields the infamous poincar homology sphere which has a unique tight contact structure .",
    "it is easy to see that this monodromy is right - veering ( the monodromy is given by a multi - curve , and it is easy to see that all the boundary components are protected . to be more careful , one can apply corollary 3.4 of @xcite to each boundary component for the monodromy @xmath293 and use the fact that the right - veering diffeomorphisms is a submonoid of the mapping class group ) .",
    "we next prove that @xmath8 is also not destabilizable .",
    "if it were , then it would be a stabilization of an open book @xmath294 , with page @xmath295 a three - holed sphere , where @xmath296 for the curves @xmath48 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are as in figure [ figure1 ] . as we noted before , such a @xmath294 is an open book on a seifert fibred space with @xmath297 . now ,",
    "since @xmath298 for the poincar homology sphere is @xmath299 , it follows that at least one of the exponents @xmath187,@xmath157 or @xmath300 is negative ( for example , @xmath301 is an open book on the poincar homology sphere ) .",
    "any stabilization which gives a page with four holed sphere must be obtained by attaching a hopf band @xmath302 to a fixed boundary component of @xmath295 and introducing a new monodromy curve @xmath303 which intersects the cocore of @xmath302 at a unique point , so that @xmath304 , where @xmath305 is extended by identity along @xmath302 to a diffeomorphism of @xmath9 .",
    "we now argue that the monodromy of every such open book is not right - veering . indeed , by noting that the curve @xmath303 is constraint to intersect the cocore of @xmath302 ( which is a properly embedded arc that connects the top two boundary components of @xmath9 , in figure [ figure10 ] ) , it is easy to see that one could always find a diffeomorphism of @xmath9 ( not necessarily fixing boundary components but sending boundary components to boundary components ) , such that the configuration of monodoromy curves in @xmath306 is as in figure [ figure10 ] , where the sets of curves @xmath307 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 depicted are a permutation of the images of the sets curves corresponding to dehn twists around @xmath48 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 after stabilization .",
    "indeed , @xmath9 is composed of two pair - of - pants , separated by a curve parallel to @xmath307 curves in figure [ figure10 ] , and noting the fact that @xmath303 intersects cocore of @xmath302 at a unique point , we can arrange by isotopy so that it intersects the common boundary of the two pair - of - pants at precisely two points , and now apply a diffeomorphism of the pair - of - pants at the bottom , which fixes the boundary component parallel to @xmath307 curves , but rotates the other boundary components if necessary .",
    "finally , since we know that at least one of the sets of curves @xmath307 or @xmath308 or @xmath309 are all negative dehn twists , by looking at figure [ figure10 ] , it is now easy to see that the monodromy @xmath306 is not right - veering .",
    "this proves that @xmath76 can not be destabilized .        on the other hand , it follows from the obstruction result of @xmath310 that the unique tight contact structure on the poincar homology sphere can not support a planar open book .",
    "( alternatively , it is known that the unique tight contact structure on the poincar homology sphere is stein fillable , hence , by the results of wendl @xcite , if a planar open book supports this contact structure , it should have a positive factorization but this contradicts our theorem [ theorem3 ] . )      note that the way we argued for the overtwistedness of @xmath312 is quite special to the case of poincar homology sphere . in particular , it used the fact that there exists a unique tight contact structure on the poincar homology sphere .",
    "same argument can be made for @xmath313 to obtain right - veering , not destabilizable monodromies which support overtwisted contact structures ( using the classification result in @xcite , which in particular says that all the tight contact structures on these manifolds are stein fillable ) .",
    "however , we do not know if @xmath314 is overtwisted or tight for @xmath315 .",
    "these are seifert fibered manifolds @xmath316 , they have @xmath317 but they are not l - spaces .",
    "the classification of tight contact structures on these seifert manifolds seems not yet to have been completed .",
    "note that the corresponding monodromies are all right - veering diffeomorphisms and the contact invariants of the corresponding contact structures are zero .",
