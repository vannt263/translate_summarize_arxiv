    "the _ kepler _ satellite has found more than 3000 planetary candidates , the overwhelming majority of which are real planets @xcite . to give one example of the new parameter space probed , _ kepler _",
    "has discovered 231 `` earth - radius '' planets ( within 25% of earth s radius ) . to date _",
    "kepler _ has detected planets only by the transit method , and as a result it is highly biased toward close - in planets .",
    "for example , the median period of the `` earth - radius '' sample is 5.2 days , and the maximum period is 69 days .",
    "here we propose to apply _ kepler _ to characterizing much colder planets in the outer parts of their solar systems , using the microlensing technique @xcite .",
    "we show that although _ kepler _ is not optimally designed for this task , it can be competitive with existing and under - construction ground - based surveys in terms of finding planets .",
    "however , what _ kepler _ would add that is fundamentally new would be microlens parallaxes for a large fraction of microlensing events , including almost all of those with planetary signals ( whether detected by _",
    "kepler _ or from the ground ) . in the great majority of cases",
    ", such parallax measurements would enable determination of the host mass and distance , and thus also the planet mass , which would greatly enhance the value of both groups of planets .",
    "the requirements of a _ kepler _ microlensing survey are well - matched to the limitations on its performance due to loss of pointing stability . in order to be an effective transit - search tool , _ kepler _ had to monitor @xmath1 stars .",
    "given data - transmission constraints , this implied relatively long ( 30 min ) integrations on each star , which in turn required high pointing stability .",
    "however , to be an effective microlensing - planet tool , it need only observe @xmath2 stars .",
    "hence the same data - transmission constraints are compatible with much shorter exposures .",
    "the photometric requirements of microlensing planet searches are very different from _ kepler _ s transit survey .",
    "planetary deviations are typically tens of percent , compared to @xmath3 for transits . however , the source stars are much fainter , typically @xmath4 , compared to @xmath5 for the transit survey .",
    "microlensing events typically last a few weeks to months .",
    "they are usually quickly identified from the ground , but _ kepler _ would have to be notified of these identification to conduct its search .",
    "planetary deviations due to jupiter - mass planets typically last one day , while those due to earth - mass planets typically last about one hour .",
    "hence somewhat shorter cadences are needed than _ kepler _",
    "s traditional 30 min in order to get full sensitivity to the lowest - mass planets .",
    "the photometric requirements for microlensing parallax measurements are substantially less restrictive than for finding planets because the parallax signal extends over the entire event , not just a few hours or days .",
    "this is important : it means that even if the photometric challenges prove too difficult to find a large number of planets on its own , _ kepler _",
    "main contribution of precise characterization of ground - based planets can remain intact .",
    "at present , roughly 2000 microlensing events are discovered per year by the optical gravitational lens experiment ( ogle ) and microlensing observations for astrophysics ( moa ) collaborations .",
    "the overwhelming majority of these are found in a region that could fit in a single pointing of the @xmath6 _ kepler _ camera .",
    "thus , the first element of the strategy would be simply to point _ kepler _ at this field , when permitted by its @xmath7 sun exclusion angle . whenever a new microlensing event was found ( from earth )",
    ", it would be added to the list of _ kepler _ targets .",
    "most events are detected at least several days before they do anything interesting , so such `` uploads '' of new targets could be grouped in batches , if necessary .",
    "microlensing events could also be removed from the list when they returned to baseline .",
    "we note that _ kepler _ is in a @xmath8d orbit and so drifting behind earth at @xmath9 and hence is now roughly 1 month ( 0.5 au ) behind earth .",
    "this is an excellent position to create a large baseline for `` parallactic viewing '' while still having a strongly overlapping `` bulge season '' with earth .",
    "the observational strategy outlined above would accomplish two aims : measure the `` microlens parallax '' of a large fraction of events and detect planets in a subset .",
    "we will argue below that the planet - finding capability is comparable but not qualitatively superior to ground - based capabilities .",
    "hence , we focus first on what is unique about a _",
    "kepler _ microlensing survey : parallaxes .",
    "the magnitude of the microlens parallax , @xmath0 is simply the lens - source relative parallax , @xmath10 , scaled to the angular @xcite radius @xmath11 @xmath12 @xcite , while its direction is that of the lens - source relative proper motion , @xmath13 .",
    "the significance of a parallax measurement is that if @xmath11 is also measured , then one can immediately derive @xmath14 and @xmath10 , @xmath15 since the source distance @xmath16 is usually known quite well , measuring @xmath10 immediately gives the lens distance @xmath17 .    while in general it is quite difficult to measure @xmath11 , such measurements are almost always possible in planetary lensing events",
    "this is because the source must pass over or near a `` caustic '' caused by the planet if the planet is to be detected .",
    "the lightcurve deviation is therefore a function of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the angular source size , which means that @xmath20 can almost always be measured from the lightcurve of planetary events .",
    "since @xmath19 can be routinely measured from the source color and magnitude @xcite , @xmath21 can also be measured .",
    "hence , microlens parallax is a rosetta stone for planetary microlensing events , turning what was initially thought to be a purely statistical technique @xcite into individual planet - mass and distance measurements .      to date",
    ", the overwhelming majority of microlens parallax measurements have relied on observing lightcurve deviations induced by the accelerated motion of earth during the event @xcite . however , because most microlensing events are short compared to the time required for earth to move a radian ( yr/@xmath22d ) , such `` orbital '' parallax measurements are quite rare .",
    "another approach is to simultaneously observe the event from two locations on earth @xcite , but since the projected einstein radius @xmath23 is typically several au , this is only practical for extreme magnification events @xmath24 @xcite , and in fact there are only two such cases @xcite .    therefore , the only method that can _ routinely _ return microlens parallaxes is to combine observations from a satellite at @xmath25 from earth and so enable simultaneous observations from two locations separated by a distance that is comparable to @xmath26 @xcite .    _",
    "kepler _ therefore possesses two tremendous advantages for a microlens parallax survey : it is already in solar orbit and it can observe essentially all ongoing microlensing events simultaneously .",
    "however , it also faces challenges .",
    "some of these are related to its relatively large point spread function ( psf ) , which we will discuss below .",
    "but one challenge is rooted in the nature of space - based parallax measurements : degeneracy .",
    "as already noted by @xcite and discussed more thoroughly by @xcite , space - based parallax measurements are subject to a four - fold discrete degeneracy .",
    "basically , earth and satellite see the same event , but displaced in the einstein ring , and so having different peak times @xmath27 and different impact parameters @xmath28 .",
    "the microlens parallax , is then given essentially by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the earth - satellite separation projection onto the plane of the sky and @xmath31 is the einstein timescale .",
    "the problem is that while @xmath27 is uniquely determined from the lightcurve , @xmath28 is a signed quantity whose magnitude is measured but not its sign .",
    "thus , @xmath0 can take on four values depending on the signs of @xmath28 as seen from earth and the satellite .",
    "however , since the mass depends only on the magnitude of @xmath0 , only a two - fold degeneracy is really of major interest .",
    "that is , do @xmath32 and @xmath33 have the same or opposite signs ? or ,",
    "equivalently : is the source seen projected on the same or opposite side of the lens as seen from the two observatories",
    "? see figure  [ fig : geom ] , and also figures 1 and 2 from @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this degeneracy could be broken because the timescales of the events as seen from earth and the satellite are slightly different , and this difference is a function of @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite then investigated how well this degeneracy could be broken for events seen toward the galactic bulge .",
    "their assumptions were far more conservative than those likely to apply to _ kepler _ observations .",
    "first , they considered a narrow - angle pointed mission ( rather than a wide - angle survey ) , in which the observations of each target would be limited to a relatively few epochs , whereas _",
    "observations would be continuous .",
    "second , at the time it was believed that the source flux in the space - filter could not be accurately determined from the ground - based lightcurve , whereas subsequently @xcite have shown that this indeed is possible to at least 1% precision .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "undoubtedly , there will be microlensing events discovered that are so faint that the parallax degeneracy will not be broken .",
    "however , few planets are likely to be found in such faint events . moreover",
    ", depending on the geometry of the event , it is sometimes not necessary to actually break the degeneracy to derive good mass estimates ( e.g. , if @xmath35 ) .",
    "at present , most microlensing planet detections return @xmath11 and hence the product @xmath36 , but not the mass and distance separately .",
    "hence , these quantities are estimated only statistically for most events .",
    "the estimates make use of galactic models together with various pieces of information , such as the geocentric lens - source relative proper motion @xmath37 and upper limits on the lens flux from blended light .",
    "but generally these estimates are accurate to only a factor of two , and of course can be radically incorrect in cases of unusual or unexpected systems . in particular",
    ", there is only one planet out of about 30 detected to date that is known to be in the galactic bulge with good confidence , even though the majority of lenses are in the bulge .",
    "hence , it is very difficult to disentangle the distributions of planets as functions of controlling properties , such as planet mass , host mass , distance from host , and galactic position .    in one fell swoop , _ kepler _ could resolve all of these uncertainties , and it could do so for the several dozen planets per year that will be discovered with current and in - construction experiments . for example , standard core - accretion theory predicts a dip in the planet mass function between neptunes and jupiters . by sharpening the mass resolution of microlens planets , _ kepler _ could directly test this prediction for ice and gas giants found beyond the snow line , which is presumably their birth place .    not only",
    "would this increased precision be of direct use in better understanding the planets that microlensing is discovering , it would also put them `` on the same playing field '' as the planets , mostly much closer to their hosts , discovered by other techniques .",
    "in addition to measuring microlens parallaxes , _ kepler _ observations will probe a virtually independent set of microlensing planets from those detected from the ground .",
    "this is because it is displaced from earth by @xmath38 in the einstein ring , which will typically be of order 10% . since planetary perturbations are usually much smaller than this",
    ", planets detected from earth will generally not be detected by _",
    "kepler _ and vice - versa .    here , we estimate the general competitiveness of _ kepler _ relative to the korea microlensing telescope network ( kmtnet , @xcite ) which is the largest ground - based microlensing experiment currently under construction .",
    "kmtnet will have three 1.6 m telescopes , each with a @xmath39 field of view , located in chile , south africa , and australia .",
    "like _ kepler _ , therefore , it is in principle capable of near - continuous coverage for the fraction of the year when the sun is well away from the bulge .",
    "kmtnet will cycle through four fields , observing each for 2 min out of 10 . considering weather at these sites",
    ", it will have a combined duty cycle of perhaps 2/3 .",
    "in addition , _ kepler _ has a `` white - light '' response compared to @xmath40-band filters that are needed from the ground . taking account of the increase in both signal and noise",
    "implies a factor 1.6 advantage .",
    "altogether , these factors give _ kepler _ an advantage of a factor 12 .",
    "however , _",
    "kepler _ has disadvantages as well , and these are overall stronger .",
    "first , its aperture is smaller by a factor @xmath41 .",
    "most important , its psf is much larger . at best , the fwhm @xmath42 , whereas average kmtnet seeing is likely to be @xmath43 .",
    "since almost all photometry is likely to be below sky in either case , these two disadvantages combine to a factor @xmath44 . finally , the problems posed by field drift are difficult to estimate without detailed simulations .",
    "the exposures can be made short enough that this drift does not affect individual images , but the undersampled psf , in conditions of crowded bulge fields is likely to increase the photometric noise beyond the above naive calculation .",
    "thus , _ kepler _ will find fewer planets within the @xmath45 probed by kmtnet , which contain the richest planet hunting ground . by the same token , of course ,",
    "a _ kepler _",
    "microlens planet search would fall far short of one by _ wfirst _ @xcite . however , _",
    "kepler _ will also find planets in outlying regions , which are being surveyed by ogle and moa at lower cadence . and ,",
    "as emphasized above , virtually all the planets that it does find will be undetected from the ground .",
    "nevertheless , this calculation shows that the planets found by _",
    "kepler _ are not reason enough , by themselves , for it to do a microlensing survey . moreover , since it will be looking only at events found by others , it will be useless for finding free - floating planets ( ffp ) , which are a unique capability of microlensing despite high mass @xmath14 . if ffp events can be alerted to _ kepler _ within @xmath46d , they will appear similarly for _ kepler _ because their parallaxes will be small @xmath47 .",
    "however , if they are due to planets , then _ kepler _ will see no event at all because the large parallax puts the source well outside the einstein ring from _ kepler _ s perspective ] @xcite .",
    "rather , its principal value is to obtain microlens parallaxes , which would enormously enhance the value of planets detected in ground - based surveys .",
    "microlensing surveys are also a powerful probe of binaries , in particular low - mass binaries that are difficult or impossible to detect by other methods . for example",
    ", @xcite discovered two brown dwarf binaries , which obeyed the binding - energy floor found previously using standard brown - dwarf search techniques , but at much lower mass and tighter separation . that these binaries yielded mass measurements ( and so could even be recognized as brown dwarfs , not stars ) was only due to the fact that they were unusually nearby ( few kpc ) and so had large , easily measurable parallaxes . like planetary events ,",
    "binary events routinely yield @xmath11 , so that _ kepler _ microlens parallaxes would give masses and distances for all binaries , and so sift out these brown - dwarf binaries , which are otherwise generally unrecognizable .",
    "moreover , binaries , in contrast to planets , would often be detected by both _",
    "kepler _ and ground observatories , which would provide detailed information on their orbits .",
    "finally , while the point - lens events would not generally yield @xmath11 ( and so masses ) , their mass function could be studied statistically from a _ kepler _ microlens parallax survey @xcite .",
    "the number of microlensing targets to be observed is not large , at most 2000 in a season , and not all must be observed all season .",
    "the exposure times must be fairly short because of _ kepler _ s degraded pointing stability , but it is unlikely that they need to be 100 times shorter than _ kepler _ s traditional 30 min exposures . from a microlensing standpoint ,",
    "there are no drivers for exposures shorter than about 5 minutes .",
    "thus , it is likely that microlensing targets will absorb only a small fraction of the available data - transmission capability .",
    "other objects , such as bright asteroseismology targets could therefore be observed .",
    "in particular , since short exposures are needed due to stability problems , one could target bright dwarfs , which have higher - frequency oscillations than the giant - star targets on which _ kepler _ has concentrated to date .",

    "upper panel shows two possible trajectories of the source relative to the lens for each of _ kepler _ ( red ) and earth ( blue ) observatories .",
    "each set would give rise to the same point - lens lightcurve in the lower panel ( same colors ) , leading to an ambiguity in the earth-_kepler _ separation ( distance between red circle and blue square ) relative to the einstein ring .",
    "in this particular case , the planet causes deviations to both lightcurves ( green ) , thus proving that the trajectories are on the same side of the einstein ring .",
    "more generally , the planet would appear in only one curve , leaving the ambiguity open . in this case , it would be resolved by more subtle differences in the einstein timescale .",
