    "the _ fermi _ pulsar search consortium ( psc ) was established as a collaborative effort between the _ fermi _ lat team and an international group of radio pulsar observers with expertise using radio telescopes around the world .",
    "the two goals of the psc are : ( 1 ) to obtain radio observations of @xmath0-ray pulsars discovered in blind searches of lat data , ( 2 ) to search for radio pulsars in the directions of unassociated lat sources that have pulsar - like characteristics .",
    "this collaboration has proven extremely successful , as we describe below .",
    "members of the psc have used the following radio telescopes for these observations : green bank telescope ( gbt ) , parkes , effelsberg , nanay radio telescope ( nrt ) , arecibo telescope , the lovell telescope at jodrell bank , and the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) .",
    "one of the great successes of the _ fermi _ lat has been the discovery of 35 pulsars in blind searches of the @xmath0-ray data alone @xcite .",
    "although these discoveries were made using the @xmath0-ray data alone , before these new pulsars can be dubbed `` radio quiet '' , they must first be searched deeply for radio pulsations .",
    "in addition , any radio detections provide important new information on each pulsar including a distance determination from the dispersion measure ( dm ) , which is critical for converting measured @xmath0-ray fluxes into luminosities and thus determining the @xmath0-ray efficiency of the pulsar .",
    "a radio pulse detection also yields information on the location of the emission region from the radio to @xmath0-ray offset @xcite .",
    "radio polarization studies also provide potentially important information on the pulsar geometry ( e.g. the angles between the rotation and magnetic axes [ @xmath1 and between the rotation axis and the line - of - sight [ @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "radio limits and detections also provide critical input for population models , where the blind search pulsars give a much more complete sample of the young pulsar population , owing to the broad @xmath0-ray beams @xcite .",
    "the psc has made extremely deep radio observations of all of the lat - discovered blind search pulsars and detected radio pulsations from four of them @xcite .",
    "now , with 4 detections and 31 upper limits , it is appropriate to take a look at our progress so far . in figure",
    "[ fig : flux ] , we show the flux limits and detections ( scaled to 1400 mhz using a typical pulsar spectral index of @xmath3 ) from our observations .",
    "it is clear that we are achieving flux limits competitive with the faintest known radio pulsars ( all well under 0.1 mjy ) and two of our detections ( psr j1907 + 0602 and j0106 + 4855 ) are very faint indeed !",
    "we also note that a possible ( non - psc ) radio detection of psr j1732@xmath43131 has been reported at 34.5 mhz @xcite and so additional searches at low frequency are certainly warranted .",
    "the vast majority of these pulsars are so faint in the radio that without _ fermi _ they would have remained undetected for decades or longer .",
    "in fact , several of them resolved the mystery of what was powering unidentified tev sources .",
    "for the 4 radio detections we have dm distances and can thus convert the fluxes into pseudo - luminosities ( in units of mjy - kpc@xmath5 ) and these are shown in figure [ fig : lum ] . here",
    "we find that one of our pulsars ( j2032 + 4127 ) is a modestly low luminosity radio pulsar while the other three have luminosities of a few @xmath6 mjy - kpc@xmath5 , far less luminous than any other normal pulsar .",
    "this forces us to consider what `` radio quiet '' really means and how pulsars could have such a low luminosity .",
    "could we be just scraping the edge of the beam or is there some other effect at work ? to really answer these questions , we will need more examples of this low luminosity population and detailed modeling of the emission region incorporating geometric information from polarization measurements .    .",
    "the 1400 mhz flux densities of young pulsars in the atnf catalog are plotted as black dots , for comparison.[fig : flux],width=336 ]    ) for the four lat blind search pulsars with detected radio pulsations , compared to the population of young pulsars in the atnf catalog ( blue dots ) .",
    "three of them are less luminous than any previously known young pulsar.[fig : lum],width=336 ]",
    "with known pulsars being such a prevalent class of gev @xmath0-ray sources , a complementary strategy is to use radio telescopes to search for pulsars powering sources discovered in the lat sky survey .",
    "a significant effort was put into searches like these during the egret era , with only modest success @xcite . however , the sensitivity and angular resolution of the lat make these searches much more powerful .",
    "the sensitivity provides many more sources  there were @xmath7 unassociated sources in the first lat source catalog @xcite  and the angular resolution is such that most sources are localized to a region small enough to be covered by a single pointing of a large single - dish radio telescope ( see figure [ fig : loc ] ) .",
    "the psc has undertaken a large number of pulsar searches directed at pulsar - like lat sources .",
    "targets are ranked by how much they look like pulsars in their spectral and variability characteristics ( see @xcite for the statistical methods used ) .",
    "initially , targets were selected at both high and low galactic latitude , but it was quickly realized that the high latitude searches were highly successful at finding new millisecond pulsars , while the low latitude searches found only 1 new pulsar associated with a lat source ( psr j2030 + 3641 @xcite ) and 3 slow pulsars that are almost certainly chance coincidences unrelated to the lat sources ( see table [ tab : slow ] ) .    the lack of success at finding young or middle - aged pulsars in searches of lat sources in the plane is discussed in @xcite . the basic argument is that most detectable normal radio pulsars in the plane have been discovered in large area surveys .",
    "thus , many of the pulsar - like @xmath0-ray sources discovered by the lat near the plane may indeed be pulsars , but with the radio beams not intersecting our line - of - sight .",
    "this is supported by the very small fraction ( 4/35 ) of blind search pulsars from which radio pulsations have been discovered .",
    "the situation at high latitude has been completely different . at the end of the egret era",
    ", there were no confirmed @xmath0-ray emitting msps . shortly after launch , the lat demonstrated that msps were indeed @xmath0-ray emitters , much like their young pulsar brethren @xcite .",
    "our radio searches of high - latitude lat sources that are non - variable and have curved spectra characteristic of pulsars have yielded 43 new msps ( 42 were discovered by the psc and one by a non - psc group also targeting lat source ; see table [ tab : msps ] and figure [ fig : skymap ] ) .",
    "also , in contrast to the situation for young pulsars in the plane , the sky at high latitudes has mostly not been surveyed with good sensitivity to millisecond pulsars .",
    "this is changing with several new radio surveys designed to detect msps ( e.g. htru , gbt drift , gbncc ) .",
    "in several cases , new msps discovered in these surveys have turned out to be lat pulsars as well @xcite , and more are sure to come .",
    "as the newly - discovered pulsars are timed over a year or so after discovery , we obtain orbital parameters and precise positions enabling us to fold the lat @xmath0-ray data to look for pulsations that confirm the association with the @xmath0-ray source . in nearly all cases where",
    "phase - coherent timing solutions have been obtained the associations have been confirmed ( as marked in table [ tab : msps ] ) , but in one case ( psr j1103@xmath45403 ) the pulsar was not associated with the lat source but just in the radio beam by chance .",
    "this is likely the case for more of the new discoveries with the gmrt , owing to its very large beam size .",
    "one striking feature of this new population of msps discovered in @xmath0-ray directed searches is the fraction in ` black widow ' ( pulsars in orbit around very low mass companions and usually eclipsing ) and ` redback ' ( eclipsing binaries with a main sequence companion ; see @xcite ) systems . at the time of the _ fermi _ launch , there were about 60 msps known outside of the globular cluster system .",
    "these included 3 black widows and 1 redback . among the 43 new pulsars found in these searches , there are at least 10 black widows and 4 redbacks ( additions to these numbers are possible because some of the pulsars have not yet had their orbital parameters determined ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that it is a selection effect , where the energetic msps powering @xmath0-ray sources are more likely to be in these types of interacting binary systems , or possibly that some of the @xmath0-rays are coming from the interaction region itself ( intra - binary shock ) .",
    "another indication that this population is somewhat different than the population discovered in large area radio surveys is the period distribution ( see figure  [ fig : hist ] ) , which is much more strongly clustered at the short period end of the distribution than the general field msp population ( defined here as the 63 msps ( @xmath8 ms ) in the atnf catalog with discovery dates before 2010 and not associated with globular clusters ) .",
    "the median periods of the two samples are 3.16 ms for the psc msps and 4.62 ms for the previously known msp population , and the k - s test give a probability of @xmath9 that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "all of this supports earlier studies that find that the spin periods in eclipsing systems are preferentially faster than non - eclipsing systems @xcite .",
    "this large number of new msps also provides many potential new additions to pulsar timing array projects .",
    "most of the eclipsing systems exhibit orbital period evolution and other effects that keep them from being among the best msp clocks , but seven of the new systems are being timed by the nanograv project to evaluate their potential contribution to the detection of gravitational waves .",
    "so , while these new msps are all radio pulsars that could _ eventually _ have been discovered in undirected radio surveys , _ fermi _ has enabled us to discover them in a much more efficient manner and much earlier than they would have been , allowing for detailed follow - up observations and potentially speeding up the quest for the direct detection of gravitational waves . with different biases than the radio surveys",
    ", we are helping to get a more complete picture of the galactic msp population and finding many systems that will improve our understanding of msp formation and evolution .",
    "one lesson has been made very clear in our searches .",
    "each good candidate lat source must be searched multiple times before declaring it to be devoid of a detectable radio pulsar . in many cases",
    "the eclipses or strong interstellar scintillation prevent detection in a substantial fraction of the observations of a particular source .",
    "recently we have been focusing on making sure that the best candidate sources are observed 3 , 4 , or more times to account for this .",
    "but , what about the pulsar - like high latitude sources where no radio pulsations are ever discovered ? these could be a population of radio quiet ( as seen from earth ) msps .",
    "direct searches for millisecond pulsations in the lat data are extremely computationally challenging , even for the @xmath1020% of msps that are isolated @xcite .",
    "for the binary msps , these searches are not currently tractable .",
    "however , given the large fraction of black widow and redback systems among the lat - detected msps , another approach is promising .",
    "optical and x - ray studies of the fields of the bright pulsar - like lat source 0fgl j2339.8@xmath40530 revealed a likely counterpart that is almost certainly an eclipsing binary msp system @xcite . with the orbital parameters and precise position determined from optical observations , a search for",
    "@xmath0-ray pulsations from the pulsar in this system may be feasible .",
    "x - ray and optical studies of the error boxes of other lat sources may reveal more examples of this kind of system .",
    "+ notes : the number after the telescope name indicates the observing frequency in mhz ; no number means 1400 mhz . ",
    "= this pulsar was previously published as j1549@xmath406 @xcite before the precise position was determined .",
    "+ bw = black widow , rb = redback , na = known to not be associated with the target lat source , + @xmath11 = discovered by gbncc team in analysis of beams coincident with lat sources @xcite , @xmath0 = @xmath0-ray pulsations detected    the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
