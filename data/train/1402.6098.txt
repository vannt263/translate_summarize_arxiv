    "shape coexistence in atomic nuclei has become a very active field of research during the last decades and clear signals of its existence have been obtained at and near proton or neutron closed shells @xcite , more in particular in light nuclei with a closed neutron shell at n = 8 , 20 , 28 and 40 closed shells as well as in heavy nuclei such as the sn and the pb nuclei .",
    "it seems that , without exception , shape coexistence is associated with the presence of low - lying excited @xmath2 states @xcite .",
    "the pb region is a very well - documented example of shape coexistence , both experimental and theoretically ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". starting at the neutron closed shell ( at n=126 ) , decreasing in mass until reaching the very neutron - deficient nuclei , even going beyond the mid - shell point at n=104 , there is ample experimental evidence for shape coexisting bands in both the pb ( z=82 ) and hg ( z=80 ) nuclei .",
    "a question that arises is whether or not this structure , in which two or more bands coexist , survives when moving away from the closed proton shell at z=82 . in particular ,",
    "the pt nuclei seem to be a good example to test the survival of the coexisting families of states .",
    "it is highly illuminating to compare the systematics of the low - lying states in the energy spectra of the z=82 proton closed - shell pb nuclei , the z=80 hg nuclei , and the z=78 pt nuclei . whereas the intruder bands are easily singled out for the pb and hg nuclei in which the excitation energies display the characteristic parabolic pattern as a function of neutron number n , with a minimal excitation energy around the n=104 neutron mid - shell nucleus , the intruder structure seems `` lost '' in the pt nuclei .",
    "focusing on the systematics of the energy spectra in the pt nuclei , one observes a rather sudden drop in the excitation energy of the 0@xmath3 , 4@xmath4 , 2@xmath5 , and 6@xmath4 states between n=110 and n=108 , followed by a particularly flat behaviour in excitation energy as a function of neutron number n until the energy of those states start to move up again around neutron number n=100 .    to study shape coexistence , there are several approximations available .",
    "among them we have the nuclear shell - model @xcite for light nuclei or the selfconsistent mean - field methods for medium and heavy masses mostly of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) types @xcite , as well as their beyond mean - field extensions in the spirit of the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) . in the nuclear shell - model , shape coexistence is obtained by incorporating many - particle many - hole excitations across known closed shells in the model spaces used , while in selfconsistent mean - field methods shape coexistence arises in the form of competing configurations based on different nuclear shapes labelled by the corresponding intrinsic deformations @xcite .",
    "we should mention that total energy surface calculations have also been carried out for heavy nuclei in the pb region , starting from a deformed wood - saxon potential @xcite .",
    "constrained mean - field calculations are nowdays routinely perfomed with several effective interactions and different levels of sophistication @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , zero point quantum fluctuations not explicitly considered at the mean - field level can be systematically taken into account within the symmetry - projected gcm @xcite . very recently",
    "several works have been carried out in the pb mass region either starting from skyrme functional @xcite , using the gogny interaction @xcite or the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach @xcite .",
    "a third alternative comes from a symmetry dictated truncation of the large shell - model space , such as the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite .",
    "the ibm starts from the assumption that the low - lying nuclear collective excitations can be described in terms of bosons with angular momentum @xmath6 ( @xmath7 bosons ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 bosons ) .",
    "these building blocks are considered to capture the most important nucleon - nucleon correlations in the formation of nucleon pairs ( pairing property and quadrupole collectivity ) corresponding to pairs of nucleons either coupled to angular momentum @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the number of valence bosons is counted as half the number of valence nucleons , irrespective of their charge ( neutrons or protons ) or particle / hole character , as shown by otsuka _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .    in the case of the ibm ,",
    "shape coexistence arises including two - particle two - hole ( 2p-2h ) ( or even higher np - nh ) excitations across the closed shells , but considering them as extra bosons , _",
    "i.e. _ , pairs of nucleons .",
    "this extension is called ibm configuration mixing ( ibm - cm for short ) @xcite .",
    "an advantage of using the ibm is the connection with both the shell - model and the mean - field approach .",
    "the extension of the model space in both the nuclear shell - model and the ibm is based on enlarging the model space with multi - particle multi - hole excitations .",
    "a drawback of the ibm results from the fact that an increasing number of parameters need to be fitted .",
    "they are determined by adjusting to the large body of experimental data , including both excitation energies and b(e2 ) reduced transition probabilities , using a @xmath12 fitting procedure .",
    "thereby , the ibm predictive power becomes curtailed . a possibility to improve",
    "the approach is to rely on the ability of the ibm to derive energy surfaces ( mean - field energy ) associated with a given hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "as the mean field parameters are usually adjusted to global properties like binding energies or nuclear matter properties the range of applicability of the mean field extends over the whole periodic table and makes it a good candidate to be used to fit the parameters defining the ibm hamiltonian .",
    "it is in this spirit that nomura _ et .",
    "al . _ have recently explored the connection between the ibm hamiltonian and the mean - field @xcite , mapping the selfconsistent mean - field energy surfaces onto the ibm space . in the present paper",
    ", we exploit the possibility of studying the ibm - cm energy surfaces starting from a hamiltonian that describes the spectroscopic properties of the chain of isotopes @xmath0pt .",
    "this way to proceed is very different to nomura s method , because in that case the hamiltonian s parameters are fixed from the mean - field energy surface , while in the present work from the spectroscopic properties .    in two previous papers @xcite",
    ", we used the ibm - cm to extensively study the pt nuclei .",
    "we carried out a detailed analysis of the energy spectra and absolute b(e2 ) values for states up to an energy @xmath13 @xmath14 mev .",
    "this study allowed us to extract the parameters describing the ibm - cm hamiltonian in a precise way and we concluded that the presence of intruder configurations does not show up explicitly in the pt isotopes inspecting the systematics of the experimental data on energy spectra and b(e2 ) reduced transition probabilities ( up to an energy of @xmath13 1.5 mev ) , as compared to the pb or hg isotopes .",
    "a conclusion was that in the case of the pt nuclei , the configuration mixing is somehow `` hidden '' .",
    "attempts to describe the @xmath0pt nuclei without invoking the effect of intruder excitations have been carried out by mccutchan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will use the parameters given in @xcite without any change .",
    "our goal is to study the energy surfaces of @xmath0pt extracted from phenomenological ibm - cm hamiltonians , using the intrinsic state formalism including configuration mixing and to compare with selfconsistent mean - field calculations , _ i.e. _ , a hfb calculation with a gogny - d1s interaction @xcite . a successful comparison , even at a qualitative level ,",
    "will assess the validity of both viewpoints in the description of shape coexistence .",
    "this particular mass region ( including the pt nuclei ) has been also studied in the framework of the ibm by nomura _",
    "et al . _",
    "without @xcite and with the use of configuration mixing @xcite using as input the total energy surfaces derived from hfb calculations ( gogny - d1 m interaction ) , with the aim of mapping the mean - field energy surfaces onto ibm energy surfaces and , therefore , to obtain a set of parameters defining the ibm hamiltonians .",
    "the ibm - cm allows the simultaneous treatment and mixing of several boson configurations which correspond to different particle  hole ( p  h ) shell - model excitations @xcite . in the approach that is used in the present study no distinction",
    "is made between particle- and hole - bosons .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian describing the interacting system of two configurations , one called the `` regular '' configuration , corresponding to n bosons and the other called the `` intruder '' configuration , corresponding to n+2 bosons , including the mixing term between the [ n ] and [ n+2 ] boson systems , can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are projection operators onto the @xmath18 $ ] and the @xmath19 $ ] boson spaces respectively , @xmath20 describes the mixing between the @xmath18 $ ] and the @xmath19 $ ] boson subspaces , and @xmath21 is the extended consistent - q hamiltonian ( ecqf ) @xcite , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 the @xmath9 boson number operator , @xmath24^{(1)}_\\mu , \\label{eq : loperator}\\ ] ] the angular momentum operator , and @xmath25^{(2)}_\\mu+\\chi_i[d^\\dag\\times\\tilde{d}]^{(2)}_\\mu~,\\label{eq : quadrupoleop}\\ ] ] the quadrupole operator .",

    "these parameters are quite different from the ones obtained by nomura _",
    "et al . _  in @xcite mostly due to the following reasons : first , the present ibm - cm makes no distinction between proton and neutron bosons , while @xcite do not use configuration mixing but take into account the distinction between protons and neutrons , _ i.e. _ , they use ibm-2 @xcite .",

    "onwards the ground state turns out to be oblate while the prolate minimum lies higher in energy .",
    "finally , the height of the spherical barrier steadily decreases and the equilibrium value of @xmath26 changes from @xmath92 in @xmath79pt to @xmath93 in @xmath81pt .    comparing both approaches , ( i ) we first of all",
    "notice a different energy scale , in particular regarding the height of the spherical barrier . in the case of the ibm - cm ,",
    "this height amounts for @xmath94 mev in the largest case , while in the mean - field hfb approach , this energy becomes as large as @xmath90 mev , ( ii ) on the other hand , the onset of deformation does not happen precisely at the same masses . in particular ,",
    "@xmath72pt appear to be almost spherical in the ibm - cm calculations , while in the mean - field hfb calculations , a well deformed shape is obtained , ( iii ) in spite of the previous differences , the similarity between both approaches is remarkable for @xmath95pt , for which the spherical barrier heights ( up to an energy scale ) , the prolate - oblate energy differences , and the position of the corresponding minima agree reasonably well .",
    "we remark that for @xmath79pt , both approaches result in degenerate prolate and oblate minima .",
    "finally , for @xmath96pt the ibm produces prolate and oblate minima that are degenerate , while mean - field hfb calculations indicate an oblate minimum , even though the prolate - oblate energy difference is quite small all the time .",
    "it is worth noticing that serious differences result between both approaches concerning the energy scale .",
    "a similar situation is observed by kotila _",

    "@xcite where selfconsistent hf+bcs , mapped ibm , and phenomenological ibm energy surfaces are compared .",
    "the first two present a much larger energy scale as compared with the phenomenolocical ibm energy surface , which has been obtained from a fit to the experimental excitation energies and b(e2 ) transitions rates .",
    "therefore , these two cases point towards the existence of quite different energy scales resulting from the microscopic and phenomenological calculations .",
    "a very convenient way to compare the overall outcome of both approaches is to plot the value of @xmath26 of the ibm - cm with the one of hfb as a function of the mass number . in fig .",
    "[ fig - comp - beta ] ( a ) we depict the @xmath26 deformation parameter provided by the ibm - cm and the one obtained within the gogny - d1s hfb framework . in additon , in the same panel (",

    "as can be seen , there is an overall agreement between the mean - field hfb and the ibm approaches .",
    "both approaches point towards large values of the deformation @xmath26 around neutron mid shell , though the precise neutron number where a sudden onset of deformation arises is different in both cases : the nucleus @xmath89pt for the hfb calculation and @xmath74pt for the ibm - cm calculation , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig - comp - beta ] ( b ) , we plot the ibm - cm bandhead energy for both unperturbed structures besides the value of the ground - state energy ( full ibm - cm calculation ) .",
    "note that these unperturbed energies correspond to the diagonalization of the ibm hamiltonian . analyzing these energy curves",
    ", one observes a crossing at @xmath97pt and at @xmath98pt .",
    "these points delimit the area where the intruder configuration becomes the ground state . taking into account",
    "that the intruder configuration corresponds to a more deformed shape than the regular one ( see the unperturbed curves in the top panel ) , it becomes evident why the pt isotopes around the mid - shell n=104 ( a=182 ) are more deformed . in the mean - field approximation , deformation results from the spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry @xcite in the considered nuclei .",
    "it is quite remarkable that only one symmetry - broken mean - field configuration already accounts for the trend that is otherwise only obtained within the ibm - cm by invoking the [ n+2 ] boson intruder configurations . on the other hand ,",
    "we see how both approximations are complementary with the ibm - cm providing an intuitive geometrical picture for the onset of deformation around the neutron mid - shell .",
    "even though the calculations along the @xmath26 axis ( only considering the axially symmetric shapes ) already give a clear view of the shape evolution , it is the calculation in the full ( @xmath99 ) plane which provides the more realistic `` image '' of the nuclear shape .",
    "indeed , we will see that for the heaviest pt isotopes the triaxial degree of freedom , @xmath100 , plays a notable role @xcite .    before starting with the analysis of the pt ( @xmath99 ) total energy contour plots , it is worth to mention some characteristics of the ibm - cm parameterization . in order to determine the ibm parameters , as described in @xcite",

    "i.e. _ , whenever the regular configuration describes the ground state of a given pt nucleus , the resulting energy surface will be flat in the @xmath100 direction , or , @xmath100 unstable .",
    "therefore , in the present ibm - cm approach , the possibility to generate triaxiallity or oblate shapes is absent . in the standard ibm the triaxiallity is easily accommodated through the inclusion of three - body terms in the hamiltonian @xcite . in ibm-2 @xcite and ibm - cm triaxiallity can be generated with two orthogonal ellipsoids for protons and neutrons @xcite and with the mixing of two configurations with different prolate / oblate character @xcite , respectively .",

    "the origin of this difference deserves further investigation .    finally , it is also of interest to compare with previous phenomenological mean - field studies .",
    "calculations by bengtsson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , starting from a deformed woods - saxon potential , show that the energy surfaces obtained for the pt nuclei turn out to exhibit a more complex behavior when comparing with results obtained for the hg nuclei , covering the region @xmath115 @xmath116 region .",
    "the prolate minimum is lowest in the mass interval @xmath117 , whereas the oblate minimum becomes lowest for @xmath118 and onwards to heavier pt nuclei .",
    "the transition at @xmath119 and , at the lower mass side , at @xmath120 , passes through a @xmath100-soft energy surface .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who calculated total routhian surfaces also using a deformed woods - saxon potential , arrive at very much the same results .",
    "both of these results are largely consistent with the present ibm - cm matrix coherent - state mean - field results discussed before .",
    "furthermore , calculations within the framework of the relativistic mean - field approximation have been carried out by fossion _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the pt nuclei in the mass region @xmath121 .",
    "the results point out towards a transition from a prolate , as the lowest one in @xmath122 , towards an oblate minimum , as the lowest one in @xmath123 , with both minima present in the region @xmath124 . beyond @xmath81pt ,",
    "the energy surface becomes rather flat , evolving towards a spherical minimum at @xmath125pt and beyond .",
    "the possibility of triaxial deformation was not considered .",
    "in summary we have carried out a detailed comparison of nuclear total energy surfaces obtained using two approaches : the ibm - cm , formulated within a laboratory frame , and the selfconsistent mean - field hfb approach , starting from the gogny - d1s interaction , which is an intrinsic frame formulation .",
    "the total energy surfaces resulting from both approaches are qualitatively similar even though they have totally different starting point .",
    "the first one is a more phenomenological approach in which the parameters that determine the ibm - cm hamiltonian and , consequently also define the resulting energy surfaces , are obtained making a careful comparison between the large set of spectroscopic properties and the corresponding theoretical results .",
    "the second approach is a mean - field one based on the gogny - d1s effective interaction whose predicted power all over the nuclear chart has been shown in previous studies both at the mean - field level and beyond @xcite .",
    "both approaches result in a consistent description of the nuclear energy landscape which is at the origin of shape evolution in the pt isotopes .",
    "the common results point towards the fact that the lightest pt isotopes are slightly deformed and prolate , becoming more strongly deformed shapes , while at the same time the potential in the @xmath100 direction starts to flatten , developing a triaxial shape once having passed mid shell ( at n=104 , a=182 ) and finally becoming oblate for @xmath108pt ( @xmath100-unstable in the ibm - cm case ) .    even though total energy surfaces from the above approaches are very similar in structure for the pt nuclei discussed in the present paper , the final comparison between these approaches has , of course , to be made at the level of the nuclear observables : energy spectra , electromagnetic properties , ground - state properties ( charge radii ) , ... the ibm , being an algebraic model , has an intrinsic geometric structure related to the particular hamiltonian used . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : energy ] , and amply illustrated in the present paper , the crucial ingredient is the use of coherent states resulting in energy surfaces that can be compared with the results calculated using a selfconsistent mean - field hfb approach , starting from a microscopic basis .",
    "it is most interesting to observe a very similar overall description of the energy surfaces describing the long series of pt isotopes .",
    "a next step in comparing both approaches will be situated on the level of beyond mean - field calculations ( bmf ) , that allow for the calculation of energy spectra , electromagnetic properties , ... , which should be compared with the results obtained from the ibm - cm calculations . in this way",
    ", the effect of the collective inertia , inherent to the gcm , will be explicitly taken into account . comparing a large set of observables , as outlined before ,",
    "obtained from a bmf calculation using the gogny interaction , with the corresponding observables calculated using the mapped ibm hamiltonian @xcite will form a major step in order to understand the connection between both approaches . this could be a topic of further study .",
