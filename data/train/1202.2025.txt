    "an hadamard matrix is a square matrix having @xmath6 entries , whose rows are pairwise orthogonal .",
    "the simplest example , appearing at @xmath7 , is the walsh matrix : @xmath8    at @xmath9 we can not have examples , due to the orthogonality condition , which forces @xmath10 to be even . at @xmath11",
    "now , we have several examples , for instance @xmath12 : @xmath13    for higher values of @xmath10 , the construction of hadamard matrices is quite a tricky problem .",
    "first , by permuting rows and columns or by multiplying them by @xmath14 , we can always assume that the first 3 rows of our matrix look as follows : @xmath15    now if we denote by @xmath16 the sizes of the 4 columns , the orthogonality conditions between the first 3 rows give @xmath17 , so @xmath18 is a multiple of 4 .    a similar analysis with 4 rows instead of 3 , or any other kind of abstract or concrete consideration does nt give any further restriction on @xmath10 , and we have :    * hadamard conjecture ( hc ) .",
    "* _ there is at least one hadamard matrix of size @xmath19 , for any @xmath20 . _",
    "this conjecture , going back to the 19th century , is probably one of the most beautiful statements in combinatorics , and in mathematics in general .",
    "the numeric verification so far goes up to @xmath21 , see @xcite . for a general presentation of the problem ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "at the level of concrete examples , the only ones which are simple to describe are the tensor powers of the walsh matrix , having size @xmath22 .",
    "for some other examples , see @xcite .",
    "yet another good problem , simple - looking as well , concerns the circulant case . given a vector @xmath23 , one can ask whether the matrix @xmath24 defined by @xmath4 is hadamard or not . here is a solution to the problem , appearing at @xmath11 :",
    "@xmath25    more generally , any vector @xmath26 satisfying @xmath27 is a solution to the problem .",
    "the following conjecture , going back to @xcite , states that there are no other solutions :    * circulant hadamard conjecture ( chc ) .",
    "* _ there is no circulant hadamard matrix of size @xmath19 , for any @xmath28 . _",
    "the fact that such a simple - looking problem is still open might seem quite surprizing .",
    "if we denote by @xmath29 the set of positions of the @xmath14 entries of @xmath30 , the hadamard matrix condition is simply @xmath31 , for any @xmath32 , taken modulo @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the above conjecture simply states that at @xmath28 , such a set @xmath33 can not exist !    summarizing , the hadamard matrices are very easy to introduce , and they quickly lead to some difficult and interesting combinatorial problems . regarding now the other motivations for studying such matrices , these are quite varied :    1 .",
    "the hadamard matrices were first studied by sylvester @xcite , who was seemingly attracted by their plastic beauty : just replace the @xmath6 entries by black and white tiles , and admire the symmetries and dissymmetries of the resulting design !",
    "2 .   more concretely",
    "now , the hadamard matrices can be used for various coding purposes , and have several applications to engineering , and quantum physics .",
    "for instance the walsh matrices @xmath34 are used in the olivia mfsk radio protocol .",
    "most applications of the hadamard matrices , however , come from their generalizations .",
    "a `` complex hadamard '' matrix is a matrix @xmath35 all whose entries are on the unit circle , and whose rows are pairwise orthogonal .",
    "the basic example is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the matrix of the fourier transform over @xmath38 .",
    "that is , with @xmath39 : @xmath40    as a first observation , the existence of this matrix prevents the existence of a `` complex version '' of the hc .",
    "however , when trying to construct complex hadamard matrices by using roots of unity of a given order , a wide , subtle , and quite poorly understood generalization of the hc problematics appears .",
    "see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    as for the motivations and applications ,",
    "these partly come from pure mathematics , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and partly come from quantum physics , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us go back now to the real case .",
    "since the determinant of @xmath10 vectors is maximized when these vectors are chosen pairwise orthogonal , we have the following result :    * theorem a. * _ for a matrix @xmath24 we have @xmath41 , with equality if and only if @xmath42 is hadamard .",
    "_    this result , due to hadamard himself @xcite , has led to a number of interesting problems , and to the general development of the theory of hadamard matrices .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , in order for an hadamard matrix to exist , its size @xmath10 must be a multiple of @xmath43 . for numbers of type @xmath44 with @xmath45 ,",
    "several `` real '' generalizations of the hadamard matrices have been constructed .",
    "the idea is usually to consider matrices @xmath24 , whose rows are as orthogonal as they can be :    * definition a. * _ a `` quasi - hadamard '' matrix is a square matrix @xmath24 which is as orthogonal as possible , e.g. which maximizes the quantity @xmath46 . _",
    "this definition is of course a bit vague , but the main idea is there . for a detailed discussion of the different notions here , we refer to the articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "yet another interpretation of the hadamard matrices comes from the cauchy - schwarz inequality .",
    "since for @xmath47 we have @xmath48 , we obtain :    * theorem b. * _ for a matrix @xmath47 we have @xmath49 , with equality if and only if @xmath50 is hadamard .",
    "_    this result , first pointed out in @xcite , shows that the matrices of type @xmath50 , with @xmath47 being a maximizer of the 1-norm on @xmath3 , can be thought of as being some kind of `` analytic generalizations '' of the hadamard matrices .",
    "note that such matrices exist for any @xmath10 , in particular for @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "as an example , the maximum of the 1-norm on @xmath51 can be shown to be the number @xmath52 , coming from the matrix @xmath53 and its various conjugates , where : @xmath54    this result , proved in @xcite by using the euler - rodrigues formula , is actually something quite accidental .",
    "in general , the integration on @xmath3 is quite a subtle business , and the maximum of the 1-norm is quite difficult to approach .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these integration problems make the above type of matrices quite hard to investigate . instead of looking directly at them",
    ", we will rather enlarge the attention to the matrices of type @xmath50 , where @xmath47 is a local maximizer of the 1-norm on @xmath3 . indeed , according to the hessian computations in @xcite , these latter matrices are characterized by the fact that all their entries are nonzero , and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "summarizing , theorem b suggests the following definition :    * definition b. * _ an `` almost hadamard '' matrix is a square matrix @xmath0 such that @xmath1 is orthogonal , and is a local maximum of the @xmath2-norm on @xmath3 . _",
    "the basic examples are of course the hadamard matrices .",
    "we have as well the following @xmath19 matrix , with @xmath57 arbitrary , which generalizes the above matrices @xmath58 : @xmath59    a lot of other interesting examples exist , as we will show in this paper . here is for instance a remarkable matrix , having order @xmath60 , and circulant structure : @xmath61    yet another series , with @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a prime power , comes from the adjacency matrix of the projective plane over @xmath64 . here",
    "is for instance the matrix associated to the fano plane ( @xmath65 ) , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 : @xmath68    the aim of the present paper is to provide a systematic study of such matrices , with the construction of a number of non - trivial examples , and with the development of some general theory as well .",
    "our motivation comes from two kinds of problems :    1 .",
    "the hadamard matrix problematics .",
    "the world of hadamard matrices is extremely rigid , and we think that our study of almost hadamard matrices , where there is much more freedom , can help . as an example , there are several non - trivial classes of circulant almost hadamard matrices at any @xmath57 , and trying to understand them might end up in sheding some new light on the chc .",
    "generalizations of hadamard matrices .",
    "the hadamard matrices have applications in a number of areas of physics and engineering , notably in coding theory , and in various branches of quantum physics .",
    "one problem , however , is that these matrices exist only at @xmath69 . at @xmath44 with @xmath45",
    "some generalizations would be needed , and we believe that our almost hadamard matrices can help .    the paper is organized as follows : 1 is a preliminary section , in 2 - 3 we investigate two special cases , namely the circulant case and the two - entry case , and 4 contains a list of examples .",
    "the final section , 5 , contains a few concluding remarks .",

    "we consider in this paper various square matrices @xmath70 .",
    "the indices of our matrices will usually range in the set @xmath71 .",
    "we use the following special @xmath19 matrices :    1 .",
    "@xmath72 is the identity matrix .",
    "@xmath73 is the `` flat '' matrix , having all entries equal to @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath37 is the fourier matrix , given by @xmath75 , with @xmath39 .",
    "we denote by @xmath76 the generic diagonal matrices , by @xmath77 the generic orthogonal or unitary matrices , and by @xmath42 the generic hadamard matrices , and their generalizations .",
    "our starting point is the following observation , from @xcite :    for @xmath47 we have @xmath49 , with equality if and only if @xmath50 is hadamard .",
    "the first assertion follows from the cauchy - schwarz inequality : @xmath78    for having equality the numbers @xmath79 must be equal , and since the sum of squares of these numbers is @xmath10 , we must have @xmath80 , which gives the result .    as already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the study of maximizers of the 1-norm on @xmath3 is a quite difficult task .",
    "however , we have here the following result , from @xcite :    for @xmath47 , the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath77 is a local maximizer of the @xmath2-norm on @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   @xmath81 , and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "as already mentioned , this result is from @xcite .",
    "here is the idea of the proof :    let us first prove that if @xmath77 is a local maximizer of the 1-norm , then @xmath81 . for this purpose ,",
    "let @xmath82 be the columns of @xmath77 , and let us perform a rotation of @xmath83 : @xmath84    in order to compute the 1-norm , let us permute the columns of @xmath77 , in such a way that the first two rows look as follows , with @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 : @xmath89    if we agree that the lower - case letters denote the 1-norms of the corresponding upper - case vectors , and we let @xmath90 , then for @xmath91 small we have : @xmath92    now since @xmath77 locally maximizes the 1-norm on @xmath3 , the derivative of this quantity must be negative in the limit @xmath93 .",
    "so , we obtain the following inequality : @xmath94    consider now the matrix obtained by interchanging @xmath83 .",
    "since this matrix must be as well a local maximizer of the 1-norm on @xmath3 , we obtain : @xmath95    we deduce that @xmath96 , so @xmath97 , and the @xmath98 entries of @xmath83 must appear at the same positions . by permuting the rows of @xmath77",
    "the same must hold for any two rows @xmath99 . now since @xmath77 can not have zero columns , all its entries must be nonzero , as claimed .    it remains to prove that if @xmath81 , then @xmath77 is a local maximizer of @xmath100 if and only if @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "for this purpose , we differentiate @xmath101 : @xmath102    we know that @xmath3 consists of the zeroes of the polynomials @xmath103 .",
    "so , @xmath77 is a critical point of @xmath101 if and only if @xmath104 .",
    "now since @xmath105 , this is the same as asking for a symmetric matrix @xmath106 such that @xmath107 .",
    "but : @xmath108    thus the critical point condition reads @xmath109 , so the matrix @xmath110 must be symmetric .",
    "now the hessian of @xmath101 applied to a vector @xmath111 , with @xmath112 , is : @xmath113    thus the hessian of @xmath101 is positive definite when @xmath114 is positive definite , which is the same as saying that @xmath115 is positive definite , and we are done .",
    "the above result gives rise to the following definition :    a square matrix @xmath116 is called `` almost hadamard '' if @xmath1 is orthogonal , and the following equivalent conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "@xmath77 is a local maximizer of the @xmath2-norm on @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   @xmath81 , and with @xmath56 , we have @xmath55 .",
    "if so is the case , we call @xmath42 `` optimal '' if @xmath77 is a maximizer of the @xmath2-norm on @xmath3 .    let @xmath73 be the flat @xmath19 matrix , having all the entries equal to @xmath74 .",
    "also , let us call `` hadamard equivalence '' , or just `` equivalence '' , the equivalence relation on the @xmath19 matrices coming from permuting the rows and columns , or multiplying them by @xmath14 .",
    "the class of almost hadamard matrices has the following properties :    1 .",
    "it contains all the hadamard matrices .",
    "it contains the matrix @xmath117 .",
    "3 .   it is stable under equivalence , tensor products , and transposition .",
    "all the assertions are clear from definitions :    \\(1 ) this follows either from proposition 1.2 , or from the fact that @xmath1 is orthogonal , and @xmath118 is positive .",
    "\\(2 ) first , the matrix @xmath119 is orthogonal , because it is symmetric , and : @xmath120    also , we have @xmath121 , so the matrix @xmath122 is indeed positive : @xmath123    \\(3 ) for a tensor product of almost hadamard matrices @xmath124 we have @xmath125 and @xmath126 , so that @xmath77 is unitary and @xmath122 is positive , as claimed . as for the assertions regarding equivalence and transposition , these are clear from definitions .    regarding now the optimal case , we have the following result , from @xcite :    the optimal almost hadamard matrices are as follows :    1 .   at any @xmath10 where hc holds ,",
    "these are the @xmath19 hadamard matrices .",
    "2 .   at @xmath9 , these are precisely @xmath127 and its conjugates .",
    "the assertion ( 1 ) is clear from proposition 1.2 . for ( 2 )",
    "we must prove that for @xmath128 we have @xmath129 , with equality when @xmath77 is conjugate to @xmath130 .",
    "but here we can assume @xmath131 , and use the euler - rodrigues formula : @xmath132    here @xmath133 comes from the standard cover map @xmath134 .",
    "now by linearizing , we must prove that for any @xmath135 we have : @xmath136    the proof of this latter inequality is routine , and the equality situation turns to hold indeed exactly for the matrix @xmath130 and its conjugates .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "finally , let us mention that a version of proposition 1.2 above , using the hlder inequality , shows that the matrices of type @xmath1 with @xmath24 hadamard maximize the @xmath137-norm on @xmath3 at @xmath138 , and minimize it at @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "part of the above @xmath140 results extend to the general setting @xmath141-\\{2\\}$ ] , and in particular to the exponents @xmath142 and @xmath143 , which are of particular interest in connection with several quantum physics questions . this will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "in this section we study the almost hadamard matrices which are circulant .",
    "we recall that a matrix @xmath35 is called circulant if it is of the form : @xmath144    let @xmath145 be the fourier matrix , given by @xmath146 , where @xmath39 . given a vector @xmath147 ,",
    "we associate to it the diagonal matrix @xmath148 .",

    "( 1)@xmath154(2 ) the matrix @xmath155 is indeed diagonal , given by : @xmath156    ( 2)@xmath154(1 ) the matrix @xmath150 is indeed circulant , given by : @xmath157    finally , the last assertion is clear from the above formula of @xmath158 .",
    "let us investigate now the circulant orthogonal matrices .",
    "we let the matrix indices @xmath159 vary modulo @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath160 the unit circle in the complex plane .    for a matrix @xmath161 ,",
    "the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath77 is orthogonal and circulant .",
    "2 .   @xmath162 with @xmath163 satisfying @xmath164 for any @xmath165 .",
    "we will use many times the fact that given @xmath166 , the vector @xmath153 is real if and only if @xmath164 for any @xmath165 .",

    "finally , since we have @xmath164 , the vector @xmath153 is real , and hence we have @xmath171 , which finishes the proof .",
    "let us discuss now the almost hadamard case .",
    "first , in the usual hadamard case , the known examples and the corresponding @xmath172-vectors are as follows :    the known circulant hadamard matrices , namely @xmath173 come from the vectors @xmath174 .    at @xmath11 the conjugate of the fourier matrix",

    "in general , the construction of circulant almost hadamard matrices is quite a tricky problem . at the abstract level",

    ".    we will therefore restrict attention to the following special type of matrices :    an @xmath241 pattern is a matrix @xmath242 , with @xmath243 , such that , in any two rows , the number of @xmath244 sitting below @xmath245 is @xmath246 .    in other words ,",

    "@xcite , we see that every pair of rows has exactly @xmath263 variables @xmath260 in matching positions , so that @xmath106 is an @xmath241 pattern .    as a first example , consider the fano plane .",
    "the sets @xmath264 of points and lines form a @xmath265 block design , corresponding to the following @xmath266 pattern : @xmath267    now remember that the fano plane is the projective plane over @xmath268 .",
    "the same method works with @xmath269 replaced by an arbitrary finite field @xmath64 , and we get :    assume that @xmath63 is a prime power .",
    "then the point - line incidence matrix of the projective plane over @xmath64 is a @xmath270 pattern .",
    "the sets @xmath264 of points and lines of the projective plane over @xmath64 are known to form a @xmath271 block design , and this gives the result .",
    "there are many other interesting examples of symmetric balanced incomplete block designs , all giving rise to patterns , via proposition 3.3 .",
    "for instance the famous paley biplane @xcite , pictured below , is a @xmath272 block design , and hence gives rise to a @xmath273 pattern .",
    "when assigning certain special values to the parameters @xmath274 we obtain a @xmath275 almost hadamard matrix , that we believe to be optimal .",
    "see section 4 below .",
    "we consider now the problem of associating real values to the symbols @xmath274 in an @xmath241 pattern such that the resulting matrix @xmath276 is orthogonal .",
    "given @xmath277 , there exists an orthogonal matrix having pattern @xmath241 iff @xmath278 . in this case",
    "the solutions are @xmath276 and @xmath279 , where @xmath280 where @xmath281 can be any of the solutions of @xmath282 .",
    "first , in order for @xmath77 to be orthogonal , the following conditions must be satisfied : @xmath283    the first condition , coming from the orthogonality of rows , tells us that @xmath284 must be the variable in the statement . as for the second condition ,",
    "this becomes : @xmath285    this gives the above formula of @xmath262 , and hence the formula of @xmath286 as well .",
    "let @xmath287 be orthogonal , corresponding to an @xmath241 pattern .",
    "then @xmath50 is almost hadamard iff @xmath288 .",
    "we use the criterion in definition 1.4 ( 2 ) .",
    "so , let @xmath56 .",
    "since any row of @xmath77 consists of @xmath259 copies of @xmath260 and @xmath261 copies of @xmath262 , we have : @xmath289    regarding now @xmath290 with @xmath291 , we can assume in the computation that the @xmath165-th and @xmath292-th row of @xmath77 are exactly those pictured after definition 3.1 above .",
    "thus : @xmath293    we obtain the following formula for the matrix @xmath122 itself : @xmath294    now since the matrices @xmath295 are orthogonal projections , we have @xmath55 if and only if the coefficients of these matrices in the above expression are both positive .",
    "since the coefficient of @xmath296 is clearly positive , the condition left is : @xmath297    so , we have obtained the condition in the statement , and we are done .",
    "assume that @xmath277 satisfy @xmath298 and @xmath299 , and consider the @xmath241 pattern @xmath287 , where : @xmath300 then @xmath50 is an almost hadamard matrix .",
    "we have @xmath301 , so lemma 2.5 applies , and shows that with @xmath302 we have an orthogonal matrix @xmath287 , where : @xmath303    in order to compute these variables , we use the following formula : @xmath304    this gives indeed the formula of @xmath262 in the statement : @xmath305    as for the formula of @xmath260 , we can obtain it as follows : @xmath306    let us compute now the quantity appearing in lemma 3.6 .",
    "we have : @xmath307    similarly , @xmath308 , so the quantity in lemma 3.6 is @xmath309 , with : @xmath310    since this quantity is positive , lemma 3.6 applies and gives the result .",
    "assume that @xmath63 is a prime power . then the matrix @xmath311 , where @xmath62 and @xmath312 having @xmath270 pattern coming from the point - line incidence of the projective plane over @xmath64 is an almost hadamard matrix .",
    "indeed , the conditions @xmath298 and @xmath299 needed in proposition 3.7 are satisfied , and the variables constructed there are @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "there are of course many other interesting examples of two - entry almost hadamard matrices , all worth investigating in detail , but we will stop here . indeed , the main purpose of the reminder of this paper is to provide a list of almost hadamard matrices which are `` as optimal as possible '' , at @xmath315 , and in order to establish this list , we will just need the incidence matrices @xmath316 , plus the matrix coming from the paley biplane .",
    "let us mention however two more important aspects of the general theory :    1 .",
    "the series @xmath316 is the particular case of a 2-parameter series @xmath317 .",
    "indeed , associated to @xmath63 and @xmath318 is a certain @xmath319_q,[d+1]_q,[d]_q)$ ] block design coming from @xmath64 , where @xmath320_q=(q^e-1)/(q-1)$ ] , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus by proposition 3.7 we obtain an almost hadamard matrix @xmath317 , having pattern @xmath321 .",
    "2 .   trying to find block designs and patterns leads to the following chess problem : consider a @xmath19 chessboard , take @xmath322 rooks with @xmath323 , fix an integer @xmath324 , and try to place all the rooks on the board such that : ( a ) there are exactly @xmath106 rooks on each row and each column of the board , and ( b ) for any pair of rows or columns , there are exactly @xmath325 pairs of mutually attacking rooks .    finally , let us mention that there are many questions raised by the almost hadamard matrices , at the quantum algebraic level . for instance the symmetries of hadamard matrices",
    "are known to be described by quantum permutations @xcite , and it would be interesting to have a similar result for the almost hadamard matrices . this might probably bring some new ideas on the `` homogeneous implies quantum homogeneous '' question , raised in @xcite , and having connections with the finite projective planes . also , an interesting link between mutually unbiased bases , complex hadamard matrices and affine planes was emphasized in @xcite , but its relation with our present investigations is not known yet .",
    "in this section we present a list of examples of almost hadamard matrices , for small values of @xmath10 .",
    "since we are mainly interested in the optimal case , our examples will be chosen to be `` as optimal as possible '' , i.e. will be chosen as to have big @xmath2-norms .",
    "so , let us first compute the 1-norms for the examples that we have . in",
    "what follows @xmath212 is the matrix found in theorem 2.6 , and @xmath316 is the matrix found in theorem 3.8 .",
    "the @xmath2-norms of the basic examples of almost hadamard matrices are :    1 .",
    "hadamard case : @xmath326 , for any @xmath24 hadamard .",
    "basic series case : @xmath327 , where @xmath117 .",
    "circulant series case : @xmath328 .",
    "incidence series case : @xmath329 .",
    "the first two assertions are clear . for the third one , with @xmath204",
    "we have : @xmath330    now by using @xmath331 and @xmath332 we obtain , as claimed : @xmath333    as for the last assertion , let first @xmath77 be the matrix in lemma 3.6 .",
    "we have : @xmath334    in the particular case of the orthogonal matrices in proposition 3.7 , we get : @xmath335    now with @xmath336 , @xmath337 , @xmath338 , this gives the formula in the statement .",
    "observe that at @xmath10 big the above matrices @xmath339 are far from being optimal .",
    "in fact , with @xmath340 , the corresponding orthogonal matrices do nt even match the average of the 1-norm on @xmath3 , which , according to @xcite , is @xmath341 , with @xmath342    with these ingredients in hand , let us discuss now the various examples :    at @xmath7 we have the walsh matrix @xmath343 , which is of course optimal .",
    "at @xmath9 we have the almost hadamard matrix @xmath344 , which is optimal : @xmath54    at @xmath11 we have the hadamard matrix @xmath345 , once again optimal .    at @xmath232",
    "we have the matrix @xmath346 , that we believe to be optimal as well : @xmath347    at @xmath348 it is plausible that the optimal ahm is simply @xmath349 : @xmath350    at @xmath351 we have the incidence matrix of the fano plane ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) : @xmath68    at @xmath352 we have the third walsh matrix @xmath353 , of course optimal .    at @xmath354",
    "we just have the matrix @xmath355 , which can be shown not to be optimal .    at @xmath356",
    "we believe that the matrix @xmath357 is optimal : @xmath358    at @xmath359 we have the matrix of the paley biplane ( @xmath360 , @xmath361 ) : @xmath362    at @xmath363 we have the sylvester hadamard matrix @xmath364 , of course optimal .    at @xmath365",
    "we have the incidence matrix of @xmath366 ( @xmath367 , @xmath368 ) : @xmath369    the norms of the above matrices can be computed by using the various formulae in theorem 4.1 and its proof , and the results are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".almost hadamard matrices @xmath0 , chosen as for the corresponding orthogonal matrices @xmath1 to have big 1-norm .",
    "all matrices are believed to be optimal .",
    "the lower bound for the maximum of the 1-norm on @xmath370 , which is not optimal , was obtained by numerical simulation . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have seen in this paper that the hadamard matrices are quite nicely generalized by the almost hadamard matrices ( ahm ) , which exist at any given order @xmath57 .",
    "our study of these matrices , which was for the most of algebraic nature , turns to be related to several interesting combinatorial problems , notably to the circulant hadamard conjecture .",
    "we believe that the ahm can be used as well in connection with several problems in quantum physics , in a way somehow similar to the way the complex hadamard matrices ( chm ) are used . indeed ,",
    "since the chm exist as well at any given order @xmath57 , these matrices proved to be useful in several branches of quantum physics .",
    "for instance in quantum optics they are sometimes called the `` zeilinger matrices '' , as they can be applied to design symmetric linear multiports , used to split the beam into @xmath10 parts of the same intensity and to analyze interference effect @xcite , @xcite . in the theory of quantum information",
    "one uses quantum hadamard matrices to construct mutually unbiased bases ( mub ) @xcite , @xcite to design teleportation and dense coding schemes .",
    "as shown in the seminal work of werner @xcite these two problems are in fact equivalent and also equivalent to construction of unitary depolarisers and maximally entangled bases @xcite .",
    "although quantum mechanics in a natural way relays on a complex hilbert space it is often convenient to study a simplified problem and restrict attention to the subset of real quantum states only .",
    "such an approach can be useful in theoretical investigations of quantum entanglement @xcite or also in experimental studies on engineering of quantum states , as creating of a real state by an orthogonal rotation usually requires less effort than construction of an arbitrary complex state .",
    "there exists therefore a natural motivation to ask similar problems concerning e.g. unbiased bases and teleportation schemes in the real setup .",
    "for instance , it is known that for any @xmath10 there exist @xmath371 real mub and for most dimensions their actual number is not larger than 3 , cf .",
    "@xcite , while for any prime @xmath10 there exist @xmath372 complex mub .",
    "note that the real mub and hadamard matrices are closely related to several combinatorial problems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the case",
    "the maximal number of real mub does not exist one can search for an optimal set of real bases which are approximately unbiased .",
    "let us now return to the construction of symmetric multiports which relay on the complex hadamard matrices @xcite , @xcite . in the case of a @xmath252-qubit system there exist hadamard matrices of order @xmath373 , so one may use real orthogonal matrices for this purpose .",
    "however , already for @xmath374 real hadamard matrices do not exist , so in these dimensions , if one restricts the rotations to orthogonal matrices , there are no real symmetric multiports .",
    "therefore , for these dimensions one may always raise the following question : what is the optimal , approximate solution of the problem , if one is allowed to use only real states and orthogonal matrices ?",
    "the almost hadamard matrices analyzed in this paper are directly applicable for such a class of problems .",
