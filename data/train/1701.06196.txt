    "birth - death models are a type of individual - based models ( ibms ) inspired by chemical , physical , and biological systems , where the random motion of the particles is coupled to a reactive dynamics @xcite .",
    "the usual reaction terms may include annihilation , reproduction or coalescing processes which lead in general to a nonconserved total number of particles .",
    "many recent works have used ibms to describe biological systems , and have shed light on the formation of clusters for both non - interacting @xcite and interacting @xcite birth - death systems of ideal particles of vanishing size . however , the role of the size or excluded volume , though widely studied in other contexts @xcite and its large importance for biological systems ( dynamics of microorganisms @xcite , animal flocks @xcite , chemotaxis @xcite ) , has not been considered so far .",
    "many works show the influence of excluded volume effects on randomly moving particles @xcite , both considering the size of the particles itself or rather the maximum number of particles allowed at each node of a lattice .",
    "these analyses have been performed for the discrete particle dynamics and for its continuum description in terms of a density or concentration field .",
    "it remains unknown what happens when interactions modulating a birth - death dynamics enter into play .",
    "the effects could be nontrivial , because generally the spatial range of the interactions affecting the birth - death processes would be different from the particle size which gives the excluded - volume effect .",
    "this is the focus of this paper .",
    "we try to answer the following questions : what is the effect of considering the volume of the particles in a particular interacting birth - death model ? what is the macroscopic description of this system ?",
    "does volume - exclusion affect the birth and death rates ? what is its role on the clustering of individuals ?    we address them for the case in which the interactions between the individuals are of competitive type . to this end",
    "we present a stochastic model of a system of bugs living on a regular lattice , adapting a previous birth - death model introduced @xcite to simulate the dynamics of competing individuals through nonlocal spatial interactions .",
    "the new ingredient of the model , concerning the finite volume of the particles , is controlled by tuning the number of allowed particles per node , as in the generalized exclusion process @xcite .",
    "the stochastic model allows to incorporate the main ingredients of the processes , and to investigate the range of validity of an eventual macroscopic description . in general",
    ", the latter description involves a hierarchy of equations for the moments of the multiparticle probability distribution ( including the density of particles and their correlations ) .",
    "the infinite hierarchy is properly truncated under different conditions .",
    "if the number of allowed particles in a node is infinity , i.e. there is no volume exclusion , and fluctuation correlations are small enough , we recover the macroscopic equation derived in previous works with different approaches @xcite . in the case of full volume exclusion ,",
    "i.e. at most one particle allowed per site , we analyze the conditions under which correlations can be approximated to obtain a closed equation for the average density field .",
    "this density equation is our main result and presents two important features : a ) there is no effective diffusivity coming from the volume exclusion ( this is already the case for particle - conserving dynamics with single - particle maximum occupation , as pointed in @xcite ) , and b ) a cubic density term in the reaction part accounts for this .",
    "we analyze this equation , mainly in the one - dimensional case , and obtain the phase diagram where the different solutions are shown and compared with the numerical simulation of the stochastic particle dynamics .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we introduce the individual - based model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : macro ] we derive the macroscopic description . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we analyze the homogeneous solutions of the density equation and make a linear stability analysis to see when spatial patterns arise . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we compare the theoretical results with the numerical simulations of the stochastic particle model . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] we discuss our results .",
    "in brief , we consider a model of competing finite - size organisms that randomly move ( diffuse ) in space , and that may die or reproduce . in this last case the newborn is located in a neighboring position if available .",
    "competition is introduced in the system via the birth rate , so that the probability of reproduction decreases with the number of individuals within a given neighborhood of given radius @xmath0 .",
    "more in detail , the system is an ensemble of identical particles living on a @xmath1dimensional hypercubic lattice @xmath2 , embedded in @xmath3 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the total number of nodes is @xmath4 and the lateral length of the system is @xmath5 .",
    "any possible configuration of the system is given by the set @xmath6 of occupation numbers @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the maximum number of particles that node @xmath9 can have . given a node @xmath9",
    "we define two sets of neighboring nodes , characterizing the two types of interactions occurring in the system : @xmath10 is the set of first neighbors of node @xmath9 including itself . in our hypercubic lattice",
    "each of the sets @xmath10 contains @xmath11 nodes . excluded volume interactions will be implemented in terms of this neighborhood @xmath10 .",
    "the second set is @xmath12 the set of nodes experiencing competition with @xmath9 , i.e. the sites whose distance to @xmath9 is smaller or equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is given by a continuous  time markov chain involving three independent processes :    * deaths : there is a constant probability rate for death @xmath13 for a particle at any node , hence the total death rate at node @xmath9 is @xmath14 * births : a particle at node @xmath9 gives birth another one at @xmath15 with probability rate @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a positive constant ( the actual birth rate if the particle has only one empty accessible site and there is no competition ) , @xmath18 is a constant that accounts for the effect of resource competition , @xmath19 is the total number of particles in the set @xmath12 , and the subscript @xmath20 of @xmath21 is a shortcut of @xmath22 with @xmath20 being the heaviside function , insuring that this rate does not become negative .",
    "note that the particle birth rate into site @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath24 , i.e. the available capacity of this site to hold more particles , an implementation of the excluded - volume effect .",
