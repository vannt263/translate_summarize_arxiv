    "self - organization of society structures and the formation of hierarchies has always been an important issue in sociological studies.@xcite recently , a fresh point of view in the same problem was introduced through application of statistical physics concepts and methods . a simple , yet powerful enough , model was introduced by bonabeau _ et al._@xcite in order to explain the uneven distribution of fame , wealth , etc .",
    "the model was further modified later by stauffer,@xcite who introduced a feedback mechanism for determining the probability of one s social rise or fall in the hierarchy .",
    "the above model places the interacting individuals on a lattice , so that the space , as experienced by a participant , is homogenous .",
    "recently , though , a huge number of observations on social ( among many others ) systems has revealed a strongly inhomogeneous character in the number of connections between individuals.@xcite in the present study , thus , we extend the model of bonabeau _ et al . _ in the case where the substrate of the agents motion and interaction is such a scale - free network .",
    "in the original version of the model proposed by bonabeau _ et al._@xcite a number of agents are distributed randomly on a @xmath0 lattice , occupying a concetration @xmath1 of the total number of lattice sites .",
    "each site can host only one individual .",
    "these individuals perform isotropic random walks on the lattice . a random agent is chosen and moves equiprobably to one of its four neighboring sites , while the system time advances by @xmath2 ( when all individuals have moved on average once , time is considered to have advanced by one monte - carlo step ) . each person @xmath3 is characterized by a parameter @xmath4 which is a measure of an individual s ` fitness ' and can represent wealth , power , or any property that is judged to be important in a society .",
    "initially all participating agents are of equal status ( @xmath5 ) and there is no hierarchy in the population .",
    "when in the process of the random walk , though , an individual @xmath3 tries to visit a site already occupied by another person @xmath6 , there is a fight between the two . if the ` attacking ' person wins then @xmath3 and @xmath6 exchange their positions .",
    "otherwise , they remain in their original sites .",
    "the outcome of the fight depends on the ` strength ' @xmath7 of the two opponents , with a probability @xmath8 that @xmath3 wins over @xmath6 : @xmath9 } \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a free parameter , with a constant value within each realization . after a fight",
    "the fitness @xmath7 of a person participating in a fight is updated : the fitness of the winner @xmath7 increases by 1 , while the fitness of the loser decreases by 1 .",
    "thus , the variable @xmath4 measures the number of wins minus the number of losses , but it is also modified by an effect of fading memory .",
    "after one monte carlo step the fitness of all individuals decreases to 90% of its current value .",
    "in other words , in order to keep a large enough strength it is not enough to have won a lot of fights in the past and remain inactive , but one must always retain one s strength by participating ( and winning ) in fights . when the density of participants is low , this memory loss is the prevailing mechanism that drives the system towards the egalitarian status , since fights in that case are rare .    the level of separation in a society is measured via an order parameter , which is taken to be the dispersion in the probability of winning a fight @xmath11 the average is considered over all fights occuring within one monte carlo time step .",
    "a large value of @xmath12 reveals an hierarchical society where the probability of winning differs considerably among the population . on the contrary ,",
    "values of @xmath12 close to zero imply that on the average all society members ` fight ' each other in terms of equivalent forces .    in the original paper",
    "a phase transition was observed upon increasing the density @xmath1 , from @xmath13 to a finite @xmath12 value .",
    "sousa and stauffer,@xcite though , pointed out that the transition was an artifact of the simulations and this transition was in fact absent .",
    "later , stauffer proposed a different mechanism for calculating the winning probability,@xcite where feedback from the current system state was introduced in the following form : @xmath14 } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq_stauffer}\\ ] ] in this case , an hierarchically organized population ( large @xmath12 value ) enhances the probability of the strongest member to win , and thus introduces a preference towards already strong individuals .",
    "this mechanism restored the sharp transition of @xmath12 with increasing @xmath8 , yielding a critical value close to @xmath15 .    in this work",
    "we apply the modified model of eq .",
    "( [ eq_stauffer ] ) on scale - free networks .",
    "a scale - free network is a graph where the probability that a node has @xmath16 links to other nodes follows a power law @xmath17 where usually @xmath18 .",
    "we prepare a number of different networks ( typically of the order of 100 ) with a given @xmath19 value using the configuration model : first , the number of links for each node is determined by drawing random numbers from the distribution ( [ pk ] ) and then links are established between randomly chosen pairs of nodes .",
    "care is taken to avoid self - links or double links between two nodes .",
    "this process may create isolated clusters of nodes , so in our simulations we only keep the largest cluster in the system which ( depending on @xmath19 ) comprises 35 - 100% of the number of system nodes @xmath20 .",
    "individuals are randomly placed on the system nodes and move along the links .",
    "a person on a node with @xmath16 connections choses randomly one of the connected nodes with probability @xmath21 and tries to jump there .",
    "if the node is occupied a fight takes place under the same rules as in the case of the lattice .",
    "with increasing density @xmath1 of the population , ( a ) on the largest cluster of a network with @xmath22 and @xmath23 nodes , and ( b ) on regular two - dimensional lattice .",
    "[ fig1],title=\"fig : \" ]   with increasing density @xmath1 of the population , ( a ) on the largest cluster of a network with @xmath22 and @xmath23 nodes , and ( b ) on regular two - dimensional lattice .",
    "[ fig1],title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) we present the distribution of @xmath8 for different population densities @xmath1 , for networks with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 nodes .",
    "we have verified that the observed behavior is in general valid for other values of @xmath19 as well .",
    "when @xmath1 is very small , there are only rare encounters between the individuals and all winning probabilities are equal to @xmath24 , which yields a delta function distribution up to @xmath25 .",
    "when @xmath1 becomes greater than @xmath26 the form of the distribution changes drastically .",
    "the peak is getting lower , until it completely dissapears .",
    "now , in the region around @xmath27 all winning probabilities are almost equiprobable and evenly distributed among the population . upon further increasing @xmath1",
    "a strong polarization arises in the population with most people having a vanishing winning probability .",
    "very few individuals have intermediate values of @xmath8 , and another peak appears in the distribution close to the area of complete dominance @xmath28 .",
    "the intensity of this peak is lower than the peak at @xmath29 , indicating that the clique of ` strong ' individuals has fewer members than the community of low-`strength ' members .     as a function of the population density @xmath1 for scale - free networks with exponent @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( shown on the plot ) .",
    "results were averaged over 100 different network realizations of @xmath23 nodes , using typically @xmath34 steps per run .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    comparison with the case of a lattice ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) reveals some interesting features .",
    "the general behavior is similar ( going from a delta function to uniform distribution to increasing peaks at the edges of the distribution ) .",
    "however , the range over where these transitions take place is very different , with networks leaving the egalitarian state in much lower densities ( notice the logarithmic axis of @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "more important is the observation that on a lattice the two peaks of the winning probability distribution at high population densities are completely symmetric .",
    "this symmetry is due to the homogeneity of the lattice , contrary to the result for the scale - free networks . on a network ,",
    "when an individual with high winning probability is placed on a hub will fight against many opponents , who have lower @xmath8 .",
    "these low-@xmath8 individuals at the branches of the hub try to pass through the hub , where they will probably lose the fight .",
    "in this way , they will become weaker while they will further strengthen the already strong person . in practice ,",
    "one strong individual can keep a quite large number of weaker people into a losing state , which is the mechanism underlying the observed assymetry in the two peaks .",
    "in general , roughly 60 - 65% of the individuals belong to the @xmath35 community and 20 - 25% belong to the @xmath36 clique .",
    "the observed change in the distribution shape with increasing @xmath1 already hints the existence of a sharp phase transition .",
    "this transition is indeed verified by our simulations , when using our order parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the critical threshold for all @xmath19 values is significantly lower than in the case of lattices ( where @xmath37 ) .",
    "in fact , when @xmath30 or @xmath38 there is almost no threshold and an hierarchical society emerges as soon as there is a non - zero population on the lattice , due to the frequent encounters . for @xmath39",
    "the threshold has a finite value , which is still in low densities , of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "it is also noteworthy that for networks with low @xmath19 , the asymptotic value of the order parameter is smaller than the one for networks with large @xmath19 values .",
    "this shows that the most - connected networks initially establish an hierarchical society at lower densities than less connected networks , but retain a lower level of hierarchy at larger densities .",
    "the network heterogeneity also introduces another effect , apart from moving the critical threshold closer to @xmath41 . for concentrations close to criticality from below ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath12 in networks of the same @xmath19 may be very different .",
    "thus , for e.g. @xmath22 and @xmath42 , in most realizations the value @xmath12 vanishes in a few hundrend steps . in a significant percentage ( roughly 10 - 15% ) of the realizations ,",
    "though , we have observed that @xmath12 would retain a large value and fluctuate around @xmath43 even after @xmath44 steps .",
    "inspection of these realizations revealed that almost all of them finally converge to @xmath13 , but the time for equilibration may be of the order of @xmath45 steps or even more , while the fluctuations in the value of @xmath12 with time are large ( @xmath12 can assume values very close to 0 or rise up to 0.45 , before settling to @xmath13 ) .",
    "these long relaxation times and the wide dispersion of @xmath12 show that a society with a density close to the criticality on a scale - free network may remain in turbulence for a long time , and even a small number of individuals may separate into different hierarchies for a significant duration , before finally settling to an egalitarian society .     as a function of the population density @xmath1 for scale - free networks of varying sizes from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "results for ( a ) @xmath38 and ( b ) @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    finally , we studied the effect of the network size on our presented results ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the curves seem to converge for networks of @xmath23-@xmath45 nodes . for a given @xmath19 value , all network sizes used follow roughly a common curve at large population densities .",
    "the transition threshold , on the other hand , varies with @xmath20 . increasing the network size leads to a lower transition value @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath48 for @xmath38 tends to 0 , for large enough networks , while for @xmath22 it tends to a small value of around @xmath49 .",
    "inspection of other @xmath19 values indicates that in the range @xmath50 the value of @xmath48 tends to zero with increasing network size , while when @xmath51 the transition point is around @xmath52 .",
    "in this work we studied the model of bonabeau for the case where the population moves on the nodes of a scale - free network .",
    "a number of important differences were observed , as compared to the case of lattice diffusion .",
    "the heterogeneity of the scale - free structure and the different behavior of the diffusion process strongly affect the results of the model .",
    "for example , it is known that diffusion is not a very efficient process on networks , in the sense that a random walker can never really get away from the origin on finite - size networks @xcite .",
    "this factor causes the individuals to remain close to each other and a large number of encounters take place , even there are only few individuals .",
    "this results in a extremely low value of the density threshold that separates egalitarian from hierarchical societies .",
    "in fact , for @xmath53 there is a strong indication from the simulations that @xmath54 , at least for large network sizes @xmath20 .",
    "the number of individuals with strong probability of winning is also significantly lower than the number of people that can not easily win a fight and thus climb in the hierarchy .",
    "this assymetry is not observed in lattices , where the isotropic environment of motion equally favors the development of the two separated communities , but with equal number of members .",
