    "the two wells have essentially the same widths . we adopt the annealing protocol described in the section  [ secmethod ] , where the parameter @xmath100 is linearly reduced to zero ( in a step - wise manner ) .",
    "we perform both dmc simulations with importance sampling ( using a boltzmann - like trial wave function @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is a fictitious inverse temperature ) and also without importance sampling , setting @xmath103 .",
    "the results for the residual energy @xmath88 as a function of the annealing time @xmath59 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( we recall that the number of dmc steps , and so the simulation run - time , is simply proportional to @xmath59 ) .",
    "we observe that the use of importance sampling introduces a quantitative improvement , providing somewhat lower residual energies ; however , the two approaches ( with and without importance sampling ) display the same asymptotic scaling @xmath104 , meaning that the efficiency of the optimization process is not affected in a qualitative manner .",
    "this power - law dependence with the characteristic power @xmath105 was first found in ref .",
    "@xcite by exactly solving the imaginary - time schrdinger equation for a single harmonic well ; it appears to be a generic feature of dmc quantum annealing in the asymptotic regime .",
    "[ fig1 ] also displays the residual energies obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using the pimc method , employing a linear annealing protocol as in our dmc simulations . for the pimc data , the annealing time @xmath59 represents the number of monte carlo sweeps",
    "one observes that for large @xmath59 the pimc data decay similarly to the dmc results ; however , in the @xmath106 limit they saturate at the energy corresponding to the temperature at which the pimc simulations were performed . in principle , this finite temperature could be reduced arbitrarily close to zero ( but at the expense of higher computational cost ) ; therefore , we conclude that the dmc and the pimc quantum annealing methods perform comparably well in this symmetric double - well problem . +",
    "a more interesting test problem is obtained by introducing an asymmetry in the widths of the two wells ; specifically , we consider the asymmetric potential : @xmath107 where the new constants are @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in this case , the well corresponding to the false minimum is wider than the well corresponding to the absolute minimum ( which is located at @xmath110 , to linear order in @xmath111 ) . in the early state of the annealing process , where zero - point motion is large , the wave function weight is mostly located close to the false minimum , implying a larger probability to find the quantum particle in the wider well . only in a later stage of the annealing process , where the annealing parameter @xmath40 is small ( corresponding to a large particle mass ) , the wave function starts concentrating in the deepest ( narrower ) well .",
    "this is reflected in the dependence of @xmath88 versus @xmath59 obtained with the dmc algorithm , which displays different behaviors in the two stages , with the crossover taking place at @xmath112 . in the asymptotic regime @xmath113",
    ", the residual energy decays again with the power - law @xmath104 , just like in the symmetric wells case , both with and without importance sampling .",
    "+ it is interesting to observe that the pimc data display a qualitatively different behavior : the residual energy decreases much slower than in the symmetric wells case , even well before the thermal limit is reached .",
    "this occurs in spite of the fact that the pimc simulations were performed including the so - called instanton monte carlo update , which is designed to displace a significant portion of the path - integral across the energy barrier which separates the two wells , exploiting the knowledge of the potential landscape details . in principle",
    ", this kind of update should boost the performance of the pimc simulations , strongly favoring equilibration .",
    "however , it is clear that in the framework of the annealing process this is not sufficient ; in fact , the transfer to the deepest ( but narrower ) well is particularly slow .",
    "this dramatic change of efficiency going from symmetric to asymmetric double - wells appears to be a deficiency of the path - integral scheme , rather than a genuine feature of a perfect quantum annealer .",
    "indeed , when quantum annealing is simulated via the dmc algorithm , the asymmetry of the two wells has essentially no effect on the optimization efficiency . in the dmc scheme",
    ", the random - walker distribution in the different wells easily equilibrates thanks to the branching process , making it perfectly suited to simulate the optimization of potential energy landscapes in situations where quantum tunneling across energy barriers plays a fundamental computational role .",
    "such a case was indeed recently implemented by researchers working with a d - wave two chip via an appropriate choice of the couplings between the quantum spins in two unit cells of the chimera graph  @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the effective double - well potential varies in time , with the false minimum appearing first , and the absolute minimum appearing at a later time . while classical trajectories would remain trapped in the false minimum , quantum tunneling allows the system to reach the absolute minimum .",
    "this setup is slightly different from the double - well model we address here : in our case the potential does not vary with time , but the system is initially attracted towards the well corresponding to the wrong minimum due to its larger width .",
    "it is possible that in the time - dependent potential case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite the pimc and dmc algorithms would perform equally well . + the dmc simulations have a more direct connection with the quantum annealing as understood in the framework of adiabatic quantum computing , which assumes a real - time schrdinger dynamics with a time - dependent hamiltonian  @xcite . indeed , inspired by the conjecture formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , morita and nishimori  @xcite showed that , from the imaginary - time version of the adiabatic theorem , it follows that the residual energy obtained from the imaginary - time schrdinger dynamics has , for @xmath57 , the same asymptotic scaling form as the one obtained from the real - time schrdinger dynamics .",
    "since the dmc algorithm stochastically simulates the imaginary - time schrdinger equation - with the difference that the annealing parameter is decreased in a step - wise manner ( see section  [ secmethod ] ) - it represents a more legitimate benchmark for the performance of the quantum annealing process as it would be implemented on an ideal ( perfectly isolated ) quantum device operating at zero temperature . clearly , the conditions for the applicability of the adiabatic perturbation theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely that the adiabatic ground - state contribution is the dominant one at all times , might be violated in certain , possibly relevant , cases .",
    "however , the strong relation between imaginary - time and real - time dynamics has been , in fact , confirmed in nontrivial simulations of both clean and disordered ising models driven to critical points  @xcite . as an illustrative example which also confirms this relation , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( central panel ) the residual energies for the symmetric double - well case as obtained by performing quantum annealing via real - time schrdinger dynamics .",
    "these data were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite via exact ( deterministic ) numerical integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation . as predicted by the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , the real - time residual energies share the same asymptotic scaling behavior as the dmc imaginary - time data , the uniform shift being affected by the use of importance sampling and of the mixed energy estimator in the dmc simulations ( see section  [ secmethod ] ) .",
    "therefore , one understands the importance of comparing the performance of the dmc algorithm with the one of ca - based methods in this and in more challenging optimization problems ; this will help us understand in which situations quantum annealing has at least the potential to outperform classical algorithms .",
    "also , it is useful to establish if and when the stochastic simulation of the imaginary - time schrdinger dynamics on a classical computer via the dmc algorithm becomes unfeasible ( e.g. , due to the exponential growth on the required random - walker number  @xcite ) , because only in such a case one is actually forced to resort to quantum devices .",

    "instead , the dmc data display the same asymptotic decay @xmath92 for all values of @xmath135 .",
    "as anticipated before , the independence of the asymptotic power - law decay of the residual energy appears to be the hallmark of quantum annealing .",
    "the comparison shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( for @xmath145 ) demonstrates that in the most challenging optimization problem dmc quantum annealing outperforms ca , suggesting that quantum annealing has indeed the potential to outperform classical algorithms in hard optimization problems .",
    "it is particularly instructive to analyze how and why sqa outperforms ca . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the probability to reach a certain two - particle configuration @xmath146 , both with ca and sqa , after a short and after a long annealing time . in the mixed estimator scheme ( see section  [ secmethod ] ) , this probability corresponds to the spatial distribution of the random - walker population at the end of the annealing process .",
    "we observe that , in ca , several false minima have a large probability to be selected . while the random - walker distribution in each individual well rapidly shrinks , even after a long annealing time quite a few competing solutions are still likely to be chosen .",
    "this indicates that ca has high chance to remain trapped close to false minima .",
    "the behavior of dmc quantum annealing is , in a sense , the opposite : already after a short annealing time only three wells are populated by random walkers .",
    "however , the distribution in each well is quite broad , indicating that sqa is slower in sinking to the very bottom of the well . after a long annealing time , only the well corresponding to the absolute minimum is populated , but the residual energy is still nonzero since the random walkers need further time to sink to the very bottom of the well , thus selecting the optimal configuration .",
    "+ at this point , it is worth mentioning that other classical algorithms which potentially outperform ca for specific optimization problems , in particular for small systems , do exist ( e.g. , genetic algorithms ) .",
    "however , ca has proven to be one of the most powerful and versatile optimization methods  @xcite , succeeding even in challenging continuous - variables problems with multiple minima ( e.g. , the optimization of the structure of lennard - jones clusters  @xcite ) where gradient - based algorithms like the conjugate gradient method remain trapped in local minima .",
    "therefore , ca represents a fair term of comparison for sqa .",
    "we have analyzed the efficiency of sqa in finding the absolute minimum of different model potentials in continuous space , including symmetric and asymmetric double wells , and also more intricate models with many closely competing minima with both ordered and disordered spatial distribution of the wells .",
    "contrarily to the finite - temperature path - integral monte carlo techniques adopted in several previous studies , the projective method employed in this work , namely the dmc algorithm , exhibits a stable performance which is not affected by details of the potential energy landscape like the asymmetry of the competing wells .",
    "furthermore , due to the formal relation between imaginary - time and real - time schrdinger dynamics ( valid in quasi - adiabatic regimes  @xcite ) , the outcomes of the dmc simulations ( which are based on the imaginary - time dynamics ) have more direct implications for the evaluation of the potential of adiabatic quantum computing .",
    "+ while the dmc quantum annealing is outperformed by ca in simple one - variable model potentials if one employs ad - hoc monte carlo updates which exploit the specific features of the potential landscapes , it is easy to construct more challenging optimization problems with more variables where such tricks in ca become ineffective and sqa turns out to be the most effective optimization method .",
    "this result is strongly encouraging for the prospect of developing quantum devices which exploits quantum fluctuations to enhance the efficiency of optimization methods .",
    "the stable performance of dmc quantum annealing , characterized in quite general continuous - space models by an asymptotic power - law decay of the residual energy , appears to be a hallmark of an ideal quantum annealer .",
    "the dmc algorithm is designed to simulate the ground states of isolated quantum systems ; it does not take into account thermal fluctuations nor the coupling to the environment . including these effects in a projective qmc algorithm",
    "would provide us with an extremely useful tool to investigate the potential of realistic devices designed to perform adiabatic quantum computations .",
    "this is clearly an interesting direction for future research .",
    "also , it would be important to identify the cases where the dmc simulations become infeasible due to , e.g. , an exponential scaling of the required random - walker number  @xcite . computational problems of this kind did not occur in any of the double - well and multi - well problems addressed in this work , probably due to the small particle number",
    ". however , in the context of standard ( i.e. , without annealing ) quantum simulations of parahydrogen clusters , results suggesting an exponential scaling of the random - walker population with the system size have been reported  @xcite .",
    "also , frustration is expected to harm the efficiency of the dmc simulations .",
    "further exploring such potential pathologies of the dmc algorithm in the context of quantum annealing simulations could shed light on the features which make a problem hard for optimization methods based on quantum fluctuations , and also on the conditions where adiabatic quantum computers are expected to outperform stochastic simulations performed on classical computers . + we acknowledge insightful discussions with g. mossi , g. santoro , a. scardicchio , m. troyer ."

    "<S> unfortunately , giving a definite answer to this issue using classical computers is not straightforward  @xcite , since the computational times required to exactly simulate the real - time dynamics of the quantum annealing process ( as defined in the framework of adiabatic quantum computing  @xcite ) increase exponentially with the number of variables . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one has to resort to approximate simulation methods . </S>",
    "<S> the most relevant one consists in performing stochastic simulations based on quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithms while slowly varying an annealing parameter  @xcite , thus defining an inhomogeneous markov chain  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> however , qmc simulations have also provided negative indications . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of the recent pimc simulations of the random ising models performed in the continuous imaginary - time limit  @xcite , and of those of the 3-sat problem  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been argued that in certain conditions path - integral based algorithms might not be able to equilibrate in polynomial times , making the evaluation of the performance of quantum annealing ambiguous  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , effective double - well and multi - well potentials have recently been implemented on a d - wave machine  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in most previous studies addressing analogous problems the simulations were performed using the pimc method ( relevant exceptions are refs .  </S>",

    "<S> it permits to sample configurations according to the ground - state wave function , thus providing access to zero - temperature properties . + it is worth emphasizing that neither the pimc nor the dmc algorithms directly simulate the real - time schrdinger dynamics of the quantum annealing process as it would be implemented on an adiabatic quantum computer . in relation to this </S>",

    "<S> @xcite that , in the regime of applicability of an adiabatic perturbation theory , the optimization performed via imaginary - time dynamics is ( asymptotically ) equally effective as the real - time counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been found that certain universal critical properties characterizing the real - time evolution through a quantum critical point can be extracted from the imaginary - time dynamics  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> + in tune with this , we compare the performances of the sqa implemented using the dmc and pimc algorithms ( for the latter we employ data from ref .  </S>",
