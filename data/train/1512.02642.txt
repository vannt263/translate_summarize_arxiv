    "while supermassive black holes have masses only @xmath6 of their host galaxies , they are now thought to exert a significant controlling effect on galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "the enormous power of the relativistic outflows and the radiation from the accretion disk may be the critical agent limiting the mass of galaxies in the universe @xcite . at the same time , the strong correlations between black hole masses and the velocity dispersions of their hosts in the present - day universe @xcite and the similarity of the cosmic evolution of star formation and black hole accretion @xcite also suggest a connection between the formation of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies .",
    "one possibility for such a connection , known as `` quasar feedback '' , is that the energy output of the black hole in its most luminous ( quasar ) phase becomes coupled to the gas from which stars in the host galaxy would otherwise form .",
    "the gas is then reheated or pushed out of the galactic potential @xcite , resulting in suppression of star formation and in a `` quenched '' galaxy . just like the winds driven by powerful starbursts @xcite , such galaxy - wide quasar - driven winds are likely to be inhomogeneous , with different phases of the wind medium observable in different domains of the electromagnetic spectrum . as a result",
    ", observational evidence for quasar - driven winds has been accumulating via multiple different observational techniques which trace different components of the wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one fruitful technique is observations of forbidden emission lines of ionized gas . because luminous quasars can easily ionize all the available gas over the entire galaxy and even into intergalactic space @xcite",
    ", the large spatial extents of ionized gas by themselves do not constitute evidence for quasar feedback or a wind : very extended narrow line emission could simply be due to gas left - over from a merger event or even a small companion galaxy illuminated by the quasar .",
    "rather , a tell - tale sign of a galactic wind is the presence of strongly kinematically disturbed gas at large distances from the galactic center , as measured by spatially resolved long - slit and integral field unit observations @xcite .",
    "gas extended over a few kpc scales and moving with velocities of @xmath7 km s@xmath3 can not be in dynamical equilibrium with the galaxy and can not be confined by any realistic galactic potential . even in the absence of spatial information",
    ", it is often assumed that in quasars forbidden line emission must be extended on scales of @xmath8 kpc because forbidden transitions arise in relatively low density ( @xmath9 from 10 @xmath10 to a few@xmath11 @xmath10 ) warm ( @xmath12  k ) clouds .",
    "therefore , very high velocity dispersions or strong line asymmetries in forbidden lines  especially blue - shifts which arise naturally in dusty winds @xcite  are sufficient evidence of high - velocity extended outflows @xcite .",
    "the key epoch for studies of quasar feedback is that of peak star formation and quasar activity at redshifts @xmath0 @xcite : this is likely the epoch at which the modern - day relationships between black holes and their hosts were established , as massive galaxies grew most of their stellar mass at that time . in evolutionary models of quasar obscuration",
    "@xcite it is the obscured quasars which are most likely to be found in the strong feedback phase .",
    "therefore , luminous red and type 2 quasars at the peak galaxy formation epoch are promising locations to look for the most powerful quasar - driven winds .",
    "while obscured quasars remain difficult to find in large numbers at high redshifts because of their faintness in the rest - frame ultra - violet and optical , and often even at x - ray wavelengths , several samples have become recently available @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a discovery of extreme ionized gas outflows in four luminous red quasars identified by @xcite , which we will argue are a manifestation of strong quasar feedback . in section",

    "the sources are identified by their full hhmmss.ss+ddmmss.s coordinates in table [ tab:1 ] and shortened to sdss  jhhmm+ddmm elsewhere .",
    "we use air wavelengths for emission - line identifications in the text , but because sdss and vlt spectra are calibrated for vacuum wavelengths , in all calculations we use vacuum wavelengths of emission lines ( e.g. , [ oiii]@xmath55007  has a laboratory wavelength of 5008.24 ) .",
    "there is extensive nomenclature associated with accreting supermassive black holes . in this paper",
    "we refer to them collectively as active ( galactic ) nuclei , and to the luminous subset of them ( @xmath16 erg s@xmath3 ) as quasars .",
    "we refer to quasars as ` type 1 ' , ` type 2 ' and ` red ' based on their salient optical - to - infrared properties .",
    "type 1 quasars are those with blue optical colors and broad permitted emission lines with widths of several thousand km s@xmath3 .",
    "type 2 quasars have low continua and strong emission lines with the same kinematics in forbidden and permitted emission lines and with typical line widths of a few hundred km s@xmath3 .",
    "red quasars are identified by their high infrared - to - optical or red - to - blue ratios .",
    "the unification model of active nuclei established a reasonable association between the amount of obscuration and these properties , with type 2 / red / type 1 classification typically running from most to least obscured , and the challenges to this picture presented by the extremely red quasars are discussed in section [ sec : type ] .",
    "the targets for this work are drawn from the sample of extremely red quasars by @xcite . briefly , in a search of obscured ( red and type 2 ) quasar candidates , @xcite selected objects classified as quasars in the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; @xcite ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) database , which also had extreme infrared - to - optical colors as measured by the sdss and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) . from the parent sample of 256,000 optically confirmed sdss spectra , @xcite selected and studied 65 sources at the tail of the infrared - to - optical ratio distribution .",
    "most of these objects are , as expected , type 2 or heavily reddened type 1 quasars , but about twelve objects defy simple explanations .",
    "these sources have rest - frame ultra - violet emission lines with the high rest equivalent widths ( e.g. , civ@xmath51549  with rew@xmath17 ) expected in type 2 quasars where the continuum is strongly suppressed due to obscuration but lines arise in an extended region .",
    "however , the emission line velocity widths are @xmath18 km s@xmath3 , which is typical of type 1 quasars , and emission lines often display bizarre shapes and line ratios not commonly seen in active nuclei of any known type .",
    "specifically , these objects show high nv@xmath51240 / ly@xmath19 ratios and peculiar `` stubby '' civ@xmath51549  emission line profiles which lack the extended wings characteristic of lines in ordinary quasars ( figure [ pic_opt ] ) . a comprehensive study of the colors and the line properties of these objects in comparison to the general quasar population will be presented by hamann et al .",

    "we acquired near - infrared spectra with slit width of 0.9 , resulting in a spectral resolution of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "data were acquired in service mode between 2nd april 2014 and 26th july 2014 .",
    "our program was designed to have a homogeneous signal - to - noise across the sample based on the known optical fluxes which range between 21.1 and 22.3 mag in the @xmath28-band ( table [ tab:1 ] ) . the total exposure time for brighter targets ( sdss",
    "j0834@xmath290159  and sdss  j1232@xmath290912 ) was 2400s , and it was 3600s for the fainter ones ( sdss  j2215@xmath300056  and sdss  j2323@xmath300100 ) .",
    "the sources are covered by the ukidss near - infrared survey @xcite but each is only detected in one or two bands with large photometric uncertainties , with @xmath31-band vega magnitudes fainter than 19th and @xmath32-band vega magnitudes fainter than 17th .",
    "we reduced the data using a custom pipeline developed by george becker and described in lopez et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "it is based on the techniques of @xcite with all the steps computed on the unrectified two - dimensional frames .",
    "each near - infrared frame was dark subtracted and flat - fielded .",
    "sky emission in each order was modeled with a b - spline and was subtracted . even in the near - infrared arm ,",
    "sky emission could be well modeled in each exposure , without subtracting a nodded frame .",
    "this procedure has the advantage of avoiding a @xmath33 penalty in the background noise .",
    "the reddest order ( 2.27@xmath302.48 ) had to be nod - subtracted .",
    "the resulting signal - to - noise in the last order is lower than in the rest of the spectrum and the relative flux normalization between that order and the rest of the spectrum is uncertain .",
    "the residual sky emission was modeled with a b - spline .",
    "median per - pixel uncertainties resulting from the pipeline are in good agreement ( within 30% ) with the standard deviation of data around a linear continuum in a line - free region .",
    "the counts in the two - dimensional frames were flux - calibrated using response curves generated from the observations of spectro - photometric standard stars .",
    "a single one - dimensional spectrum was then extracted simultaneously across all the orders and all exposures of a single object , avoiding multiple rebinnings and minimizing the error correlation between adjacent pixels .",
    "the one - dimensional spectra were binned to have fixed - velocity pixels ( 19 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the wavelengths are on the vacuum heliocentric system .",
    "telluric corrections were performed using molecfit @xcite . because the targets were specifically selected in redshift to avoid an overlap between the major emission lines and the strong telluric absorption features ,",
    "the effect of telluric corrections is small for most measurements .",
    "the only noticeable effect is in sdss  j0834@xmath290159 , where telluric corrections lead to a 60% increase in the measured [ oiii]@xmath55007  flux .",
    "figure [ pic_spec ] shows our vlt spectra of four extremely red quasars .",
    "the extreme kinematics of the [ oiii]@xmath214959,5007  emission lines are immediately apparent .",
    "not only are the two lines of the [ oiii ] doublet blended together ( which does occur occasionally in the most kinematically extreme quasars at @xmath34 , @xcite ) , the doublet is further blended with h@xmath35 , which indicates that line - of - sight velocities of order several thousand km s@xmath3 must be present .        in this section ,",
    "we quantify the kinematics of the [ oiii ] emission .",
    "ideally , the best way to measure velocities would be relative to the rest - frame of the host galaxy as measured by stellar absorption lines , but we see no such lines in our spectra  the optical and near - infrared spectra are likely dominated by the quasar .",
    "therefore , as an initial approximation we adopt the nominal boss pipeline redshifts @xmath36 ( listed in table [ tab:1 ] ) which are obtained by cross - correlating the optical ( rest - frame ultra - violet ) spectra against pre - defined templates ( @xcite ; in our case , against a normal blue type 1 quasar template ) , but with an understanding that they are not necessarily accurate .",
    "we then measure all kinematics relative to that frame and discuss possible avenues for determining the absolute host galaxy frame later in this section .    with such extremely high velocities in the forbidden emission lines ,",
    "the traditional use of line kinematics for quasar type determination ( `` narrow line '' type 2 vs `` broad line '' type 1 ) is meaningless ( section [ sec : type ] ) .",
    "the more physically motivated question is whether [ oiii ] and h@xmath35 have consistent kinematic structure , which might indicate that they are emitted in the same physical region .",
    "therefore , for every object we explore two classes of emission line fits : ( 1 ) ` kinematically tied ' fitting functions which assume the same kinematics for h@xmath35 and each of the [ oiii ] lines , and ( 2 ) ` kinematically distinct ' , or ` untied ' , fitting functions in which h@xmath35 is allowed to have different kinematic structure from the components of the [ oiii ] doublet .",
    "the components of the [ oiii ] doublet are always assumed to have the same kinematics and the @xmath37 amplitude ratio [ oiii]@xmath54959/[oiii]@xmath55007  of 0.337 .    to determine the underlying continuum",
    ", we calculate the median flux in 20 - wide windows centered at rest - frame 4750  and 5090 , then subtract a linear interpolation between these two points to obtain the [ oiii]+h@xmath35 emission - line blend .",
    "using one - gaussian fits , we find that fits with kinematically distinct [ oiii ] and h@xmath35 are preferred for sdss  j0834@xmath290159 , sdss  j1232@xmath290912 , and sdss  j2323@xmath300100 , whereas for sdss  j2215@xmath300056  there is no appreciable statistical or visual difference between tied and untied fits .",
    "specifically , in sdss  j0834@xmath290159 , sdss  j1232@xmath290912 , and sdss  j2215@xmath300056  the centroids of [ oiii ] ( as measured from the single - gaussian fits ) are offset from centroids of h@xmath35 by -1009 , -1907 and -1545 km s@xmath3 , respectively ( in sdss  j2215@xmath300056 , the offset is nominally measured at 128 km s@xmath3 , which is consistent with 0 given the large line widths of all features ) .",
    "it is also clear from these crude fits that the kinematics of [ oiii ] are rather extreme , with velocity dispersions 1580 , 2002 , 1272 and 1168 km s@xmath3 for the four objects .",
    "single - gaussian fits do not capture well the shape of the lines , and in relatively low signal - to - noise spectra such fits lead to an underestimate of the actual velocity width @xcite .",
    "all fits are improved by adding a second gaussian component ( average reduced @xmath38 improvement is 20% ) , and these fits are presented in figure [ pic_oiii ] .",
    "the kinematically tied 2-gaussian fits ( shown in blue ) assume that [ oiii]@xmath54959 , [ oiii]@xmath55007  and h@xmath35 have the same kinematic structure  i.e. , all three lines have the same velocity offsets and velocity dispersions for each of the two gaussian components and the same amplitude ratio of the two gaussian components .",
    "the kinematically untied 2-gaussian fits assume the same 2-gaussian kinematic structure for [ oiii]@xmath54959  and [ oiii]@xmath55007 , but allow for a separate unconstrained single gaussian for h@xmath35 .",
    "because of the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio of the h@xmath35 detection alone , there is no statistical need for adding a second gaussian component to h@xmath35 in the kinematically untied fits .        the large apparent ratio of peaks of [ oiii]@xmath54959  and [ oiii]@xmath55007   close to 1:1 in sdss  j1232@xmath290912 , compared to the theoretical ratio of 0.337  implies that a strong broad blue - shifted component is required to fit the [ oiii ] doublet , which boosts the flux near the peak of [ oiii]@xmath54959 .",
    "in sdss  j0834@xmath290159 , sdss  j1232@xmath290912 , and sdss  j2323@xmath300100  we find that kinematically untied fits produce a slightly better fit to the data ; the main reason is that there is no evidence in the data for the broad blue component to the h@xmath35 line of the kind that is clearly required to fit the [ oiii ] doublet .",
    "this is especially clear in sdss  j0834@xmath290159 , where the kinematically tied fit fails for the entire h@xmath35 profile  both its blue and its red side . in sdss",
    "j2215@xmath300056  we find no statistically significant difference between kinematically tied and kinematically untied fits , so we prefer the kinematically tied fit for this object as the more simple model",
    ".    we do not assign any particular physical meaning to the parameters of the individual gaussian components within the two - gaussian fits for [ oiii ] .",
    "rather , we use the fits to compute the non - parametric measures of the [ oiii]@xmath55007  profile , following @xcite and many other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for any functional fit to the [ oiii]@xmath55007  profile",
    ", we can calculate the velocity width comprising 90% of the flux @xmath39 ( and similarly @xmath40 ) by rejecting the most extreme 5% blue - shifted and red - shifted parts of the profile . for a gaussian profile ,",
    "both are related to the velocity dispersion , with @xmath40 being quite close to the commonly used full width at half maximum ( @xmath41fwhm ; @xmath42 ) .",
    "we list these measurements , together with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and full width at quarter maximum ( fwqm ) in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the method is illustrated in figure [ pic_nonparam ] , where we display the best - fit [ oiii]@xmath55007  profiles in velocity space relative to the centroid of the h@xmath35 determined from the kinematically untied fits .",
    "as measured relative to the frame of the h@xmath35 centroid , median velocities @xmath43 ( in the order of increasing object right ascension ) are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 km s@xmath3 , i.e. , [ oiii ] is strongly blueshifted relative to the measured h@xmath35 centroid in all but one case ( sdss  j2215@xmath300056 ) .",
    "the velocity widths @xmath40 range between 3600 and 5500 km s@xmath3 , fwhm between 2600 and 5000 km @xmath3 and @xmath39 between 4000 and 6700 km s@xmath3 .",
    "such [ oiii ] widths are completely outside the range found in type 1 quasars @xcite and type 2 quasars at low redshifts @xcite , as further discussed in section [ sec : type ] .",
    "the peak signal - to - noise within the [ oiii ] doublet is @xmath48 in our sources .",
    "if our assumptions about h@xmath35 kinematics are correct , simulations conducted by @xcite suggest that @xmath40 and @xmath39 are reliable for these values and accurate within @xmath49 and that , if anything , these values would be underestimated in our sources because we may have missed another weak broad component .",

    "quasars feii is not seen , we allow for the possibility that we see at least some nuclear continuum in our objects ( whether scattered or directly penetrating through patchy obscuration ; section [ sec : sed ] ) . to estimate the effect of feii on our kinematic measurements , we use the fe template from @xcite which we convolve with a gaussian function with the velocity dispersion of h@xmath35 . because the convolved templates show characteristic fe blends centered at @xmath54  and @xmath55 , by looking at the maximal possible amplitudes of these features in the spectra we can subtract the maximal plausible fe template from the data and remeasure the kinematics of the [ oiii]+h@xmath35 blend .",
    "we find that the line widths of [ oiii ] decrease by 10% in sdss  j2323@xmath300100 , 8% in sdss  j2215@xmath300056  and 2% in sdss  j1232@xmath290912 , and increases by 8% in sdss  j0834@xmath290159 .",
    "we conclude that feii does not severely affect the measured line kinematics .",
    "furthermore , this allows us to estimate that the systematic uncertainties in our fits ( e.g. , due to continuum placement ) are @xmath56 for the kinematic measures presented in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the fwhm of h@xmath35 ranges between 3700 and 5000 km s@xmath3 .",
    "this is in the normal range for type 1 active nuclei and quasars @xcite .",
    "because of the specifics of our fitting routine , an extremely broad redshifted h@xmath35 component would be fitted out as the blue - shifted component of [ oiii ] . because we see no evidence for such component in h@xmath19 ( section [ sec : nii ] ) , we find this scenario unlikely and we take the h@xmath35 fit parameters at face value .",
    "[ nii]@xmath216548,6583  and h@xmath19 are closer together in wavelength than [ oiii ] and h@xmath35 , so disentangling their kinematics is even more complex .",
    "therefore , we first attempt to fit this line blend with the best - fit kinematics of the [ oiii]+h@xmath35 blend .",
    "we assume that h@xmath19 has the same kinematics as h@xmath35 ( one - gaussian fit ) and that h@xmath19 flux is @xmath57 h@xmath35 as required by the case b recombination with allowance for reddening .",
    "further , we assume that both [ nii ] lines have the same kinematics as [ oiii ] and that the peak @xmath37 ratio of [ nii]@xmath56548  to [ nii]@xmath56583  is 0.340 . with these shape constraints , there are only two fitting parameters  the amplitudes of h@xmath19 and [ nii]@xmath56583 . in three cases where the noise is not prohibitively large ,",
    "fits with these constraints fail in that they produce much more blue - shifted emission than what is observed ( figure [ pic_nii ] ) . from this",
    "we conclude that the [ nii ] emission must be not nearly as blue - shifted and broad as [ oiii ] and thus likely arises from a different spatial region in these quasars .",
    "in sdss  j0834@xmath290159 , sdss  j1232@xmath290912  and sdss  j2323@xmath300100 , we successfully fit the [ nii]+h@xmath19 blend with a model that uses the same constraints on h@xmath19 as above ( one - gaussian kinematics fixed to that of h@xmath35 , with case b constraint on the minimal h@xmath19 flux ) but allows for kinematics of [ nii ] independent from those of [ oiii ] ( table [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "one gaussian component for [ nii ] is sufficient to produce adequate fits . in all three objects ,",
    "the final h@xmath19/h@xmath35 ratio is consistent with case b values , even though a larger ratio is allowed by the fit , and in fact without the lower bound the preferred h@xmath19/h@xmath35 ratios are smaller by as much as 50% than the case b values ( the most discrepant object is sdss  j0834@xmath290159 , where unfortunately the absolute flux calibration of the spectral region covering h@xmath19 is the most uncertain ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that in fact the true h@xmath19/h@xmath35 ratios are smaller than case b , which is difficult @xcite , but not impossible @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the kinematics of h@xmath19 are different from the kinematics of h@xmath35 .",
    "a narrower h@xmath19 which is slightly redshifted relative to h@xmath35 might improve the fits , but the blending of h@xmath19 with [ nii ] prevents us from testing such models .    in sdss  j2215@xmath300056 , we successfully measure an h@xmath19/h@xmath35 ratio between 7.6 and 11.4 , with the range being due to the low signal - to - noise ratio measurement of the h@xmath35 line and arising from the difference in the derived fluxes in the kinematically tied and kinematically untied fits which are both acceptable . using the @xcite small magellanic cloud extinction curve and assuming an intrinsic h@xmath19/h@xmath35 ratio of 2.85 , we derive a corresponding extinction of the balmer - emitting region of @xmath58 mag .",
    "h@xmath19 is marginally better reproduced by the kinematically untied fits to the h@xmath35+[oiii ] complex ; when h@xmath19 is fit with just the [ oiii ] profile , the blueshifted side of the h@xmath19 emission is not well reproduced . from this",
    "we might conclude that the balmer emission originates in the broad - line region which is kinematically distinct from the [ oiii]-emitting region and that therefore the derived extinction values apply to the broad - line region in this object .",
    "however , h@xmath35 is very weak in this source and h@xmath19 is in the part o the spectrum with a poor signal - to - noise ratio , so these conclusions are only tentative .    with the exception of sdss  j2215@xmath300056 , where we consider [ nii ] to be non - detected , the best - fit [ nii ] lines are significantly narrower than the best - fit [ oiii ]",
    "this is shown in figure [ pic_width ] , where we use type 2 quasars at @xmath34 with [ oii]@xmath53726,3729  kinematics for comparison as the ionization potential of [ nii ] ( 14.5 ev ) is similar to that of [ oii ] ( 13.6 ev ) .",
    "this observation is in line with studies demonstrating that lower ionization lines have more quiescent kinematics than do higher ionization ones @xcite .",

    "this trend is also seen in the [ nii ] emission lines in our extremely red quasars ( red squares ) .",
    "the measured [ oii ] widths have been corrected for doublet splitting as described by @xcite . the dotted line shows the 1:1 relation . ]",
    "the velocity centroids of [ nii ] ( when fitted independently of [ oiii ] ) are offset by @xmath59 to @xmath60 km s@xmath3 from the centroids of h@xmath19 and h@xmath35 ( the measurement uncertainty in the centroid velocity is @xmath61 km s@xmath3 ) , whereas in the same three objects the @xmath43 centroids of [ oiii ] relative to the balmer lines are between @xmath62 and @xmath63 km s@xmath3 . in the absence of the detection of the stellar absorption features , the centroids of the lowest - ionization forbidden emission lines",
    "are perhaps the best indicator of the host redshift .",

    "the outflows in our extremely red quasars are affected by extinction and thus the spherically symmetric approximation is not directly applicable . to estimate @xmath134 from our data , we assume that extinction mostly affects the redshifted part and use only the profiles at @xmath135 . with this approach and using equation ( [ eq_moments ] ) , we estimate average physical velocities of the outflow of @xmath1363500 , 4900 , 2100 and 4500 km s@xmath3 in the four objects . because obscuration more strongly affects the streamlines that are further away from the line of sight , these estimates are likely biased high . for example , the parts of the outflow propagating close to the plane of the sky which produce zero line - of - sight velocities could be suppressed by extinction of the observer - facing side of the outflow . as a result , in the discussion that follows we estimate that the physical outflow velocity is 3000 km s@xmath3 for all objects except sdss  j2215@xmath300056  where the kinematics are less dramatic .    a standard method of estimating the kinetic energy of the extended ionized gas is to use recombination lines to estimate the mass of the emitting hydrogen @xcite .",
    "for this calculation , we would need the part of the h@xmath35 luminosity originating in the extended emission region , whereas our fits suggest that our h@xmath35 fluxes are dominated by emission much closer to the black hole ( section [ sec : type ] ) , making a direct estimate of the extended gas mass difficult .",
    "instead we assume that in the extended emission - line region the [ oiii]/h@xmath35 ratio is close to its standard value of 10 @xcite , which ( together with an additional contribution to the h@xmath35 from the broad - line region ) is consistent with the data .",
    "this allows us then to estimate the mass and kinetic energy of the outflowing gas : @xmath137/h\\beta}{10}\\right)^{-1}\\left(\\frac{l{\\rm [ oiii]}}{10^{10}l_{\\odot}}\\right)\\frac{\\langle v^2 \\rangle}{(3000\\rm{km\\ , s^{-1}})^2}\\left(\\frac{n_e}{100\\rm { cm}^{-3}}\\right)^{-1}. \\label{eq_en}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] no correction has been made here for the dust extinction of the [ oiii ] inferred from the [ oiii]/ir ratio , [ oiii ] shape and the rew[oiii ] values . if [ oiii ] is suppressed by a factor of 3@xmath3010 , this energy estimate needs to be augmented by the same factor .",
    "if photo - ionization by the quasar is the dominant ionizing process , then narrow - line ratios @xcite and equivalent widths @xcite suggest that most of the [ oiii ] emission originates in a region with ionization parameter @xmath138 .",
    "if the ionization conditions producing forbidden emission lines in extremely red quasars are similar to those found in less extreme active galaxies , and if [ oiii ] is produced in regions with densities less than the critical density @xmath139 @xmath10 , then we arrive at the minimal size of the [ oiii]-emitting region @xcite : @xmath140}}{10^{47}{\\rm erg\\ , s^{-1}}}\\right)^{1/2}\\left(\\frac{n_h}{8\\times 10 ^ 5{\\rm cm}^{-3}}\\right)^{-1/2}\\left(\\frac{u}{0.003}\\right)^{-1/2}. \\label{eq_size}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for comparison , the broad - line region for a black hole with mass @xmath122 is concentrated on scales @xmath141 pc .",
    "thus if the physics of [ oiii ] excitation is similar to that seen in nearby active galaxies , the high ( suspected ) intrinsic luminosity of extremely red quasars implies that the [ oiii ] emission must originate on scales comparable to the size of the host galaxy . for a more typical density of @xmath142 @xmath10 @xcite ,",
    "the nominal emitting size is 14 kpc .",
    "radiation - pressure - dominated models @xcite suggest somewhat higher ionization parameters , between @xmath143 , but even in this case the emitting size is between 2.5 and 8 kpc .    these estimates , while very uncertain , are comparable to sizes of [ oiii]-emitting nebulae directly measured in quasars at low redshifts with integral - field or long - slit spectroscopy @xcite at the high luminosity end . in these observations ,",
    "the surface brightness of [ oiii ] emission decreases away from the center , so much of the flux arises in the central few kpc , but the emission is detected out to @xmath144 kpc in some cases . because of strong cosmological surface brightness dimming , resolving the sizes of extended line regions at high redshifts is very difficult , but existing measurements also suggest [ oiii]-emitting sizes of a few kpc @xcite .",
    "strong dust extinction can significantly reduce the estimated sizes : if the extinction within the line - emitting gas itself is high , then the effective luminosity of the quasar that enters equation ( [ eq_size ] ) is suppressed and thus the size could be much smaller .",
    "we can now combine the kinetic energy estimate from equation ( [ eq_en ] ) with a size estimate to calculate the efficiency of conversion of the quasar luminosity into the kinetic energy of its wind .",
    "if @xmath145 is the characteristic time scale of the outflow ( for example , @xmath146 years is the travel time to get to 3 kpc at 3000 km s@xmath3 ) , then the efficiency is @xmath147 such efficiencies are in the ballpark of those required by galaxy formation models for suppressing excessive growth of massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "this value of efficiency should be considered a lower limit since the observed [ oiii ] is likely strongly affected by extinction .",
    "normally shock ionization is energetically subdominant to photo - ionization in quasars @xcite .",
    "but in our objects , with their extreme kinematics , the possibility of shock ionization should be reconsidered in future analyses , especially with the indirect evidence for shocks supplied by strong [ oiii]@xmath54363  ( section [ sec:4363 ] )",
    ".      how can large - scale gas in a galaxy be accelerated to such high velocities ?",
    "relativistic jets are known to accelerate gas to velocities of up to a few thousand km s@xmath3 . in a gas - rich medium , jets inflate an over - pressured cocoon @xcite which then expands into the surrounding medium and shocks and entrains the gas . in ionized gas observations similar to ours ,",
    "the median fwhm of [ oiii ] seen by @xcite in powerful high - redshift radio galaxies is @xmath148 km s@xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath149 times smaller than that of extremely red quasars , but in the most extreme cases such as the central regions of mrc 0406@xmath30244 @xcite the velocities can reach values comparable to those seen in our sample . the objects from these samples have a classical core - lobes radio morphology and a median radio luminosity of @xmath22[1.4ghz]@xmath150 erg s@xmath3 , whereas ours are below @xmath22[1.4ghz]@xmath23 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "it is thus unlikely that our sources host relativistic jets of comparable power .",
    "rather , their extremely high infrared luminosities and high inferred eddington ratios suggest that the outflows are ultimately driven by the radiative energy release .",
    "acceleration by radiation pressure on dust is usually assumed to produce winds that move with velocities just above the escape velocity @xcite . as discussed in section [ sec :",
    "scales ] , we suspect that the [ oiii ] emission is produced on @xmath8 kpc scales , where the outflow velocities deduced from the [ oiii ] line shapes ( @xmath151 km s@xmath3 ) are much greater than the local escape velocity ( no more than a few hundred km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "@xcite recently re - examined the case of acceleration by radiation pressure of dusty winds which are optically thick in the ultra - violet and concluded that much higher velocities , with a significant momentum boost , may be reached because the clouds or shells experience radiation pressure over the entire time they remain optically thick .",
    "we use their calculation of the terminal velocity of dusty winds , @xmath152 , where in our objects we estimate that @xmath153 km s@xmath3 , @xmath154 erg s@xmath3 is the luminosity of the source , @xmath155 is the mass of accelerated dusty shells and @xmath156 is the distance from the source where the shell becomes optically thin to ultra - violet photons .",
    "this distance is unknown in our objects , but we estimate it by remarking that [ oiii ] emission , despite originating on @xmath8 kpc scales , shows signs of significant obscuration , both in its shape ( strong blue excess ) and in the total luminosity ( section [ sec : type ] ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that the dusty , partially ionized clouds that produce [ oiii ] are still optically thick to ultra - violet emission at 1 kpc from the quasar and estimate that @xmath157 kpc .",
    "then for the mass of the shell , we find : @xmath158 its kinetic energy is @xmath159 erg and its momentum boost ( the ratio of the momentum of the shell to the momentum of the absorbed photons ) is @xmath160 .",
    "this kinetic energy is close to the estimate of the energy of the outflowing gas presented in section [ sec : energy ] which is based on the [ oiii ] luminosity , suggesting that dust acceleration is an energetically plausible mechanism in our case .",
    "an alternative possibility is that of light , ultra - fast ( @xmath161 km s@xmath3 ) radiatively - driven winds @xcite which then collide with the interstellar medium of the surrounding host and shock and accelerate it to produce a galaxy - wide wind @xcite , with the quasar photo - ionizing the resulting wind ( perhaps with additional ionization contribution from shocks themselves ) . when the wind is first initiated by the quasar , the high inertia of the surrounding gas allows for a build - up of pressure within the central few tens of pc as the quasar continues depositing the energy into this region via the wind .",
    "when the pressure builds up to sufficiently high levels , the pressure force can overcome the inertia of the surrounding material and drive an energy - conserving flow .",
    "extremely red quasars at @xmath1 discussed in this paper were first identified by their red optical - to - infrared colors , while at the same time showing unambiguous signs of quasar activity in their optical ( rest - frame ultra - violet ) spectra such as strong civ@xmath51549  @xcite .",
    "the infrared luminosities of these sources directly measured from wise fluxes reach @xmath162 erg s@xmath3 , placing them among the most luminous quasars known .",
    "these objects tend to display unusual ultra - violet emission line ratios  with nv@xmath51240 / ly@xmath163 in some cases  and stubby shapes of civ@xmath51549 , lacking the extended wings characteristic of lines in ordinary quasars ( hamann et al . in prep .",
    "2016a ) .    in this paper we present near - infrared ( rest - frame optical )",
    "follow - up observations of four of these objects .",
    "we find extreme [ oiii ] kinematics in all 4 cases , where the [ oiii]@xmath214959,5007  lines are not only blended together , but are blended with h@xmath35 as well .",
    "multiple kinematic measures are presented in table [ tab:1 ] ; for example , the fwhm of [ oiii]@xmath55007  is between 2600 and 5000 km s@xmath3 and in 3 out of 4 objects , the line centroids are blueshifted relative to the h@xmath35 centroids by up to 1500 km s@xmath3 .",
    "all four objects lie on the extreme end of the correlation between the [ oiii ] kinematics and the infrared luminosity ( figure [ pic_extreme ] ) .",
    "the characteristic [ oiii]-emitting gas velocities in our sources are 3@xmath106 higher than the typical values seen in type 2 quasars at @xmath34 @xcite .    at these extreme velocities",
    ", the gas can not be confined by any realistic galaxy potential and is thus likely to escape from the galaxy ; we suggest that these objects may be signposts of the extreme `` blow - out '' phase of quasar feedback observed at the peak epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "our energetics estimates suggest that at least a few per cent of the bolometric luminosity is converted into the kinetic energy of the outflowing ionized gas .",
    "such feedback efficiency is in the range of values required from quasar feedback by galaxy formation models @xcite .",
    "the observed winds are dusty , as manifested by the strong line asymmetry and by an overall deficit of [ oiii ] relative to the amount expected based on the infrared luminosity .",
    "although we can not spatially resolve the outflows with our current data , we estimate that the [ oiii]-emitting gas must be extended on scales of @xmath164 kpc and therefore the wind is progressing on galaxy - wide scales .",
    "although the infrared - to - optical colors suggest significant levels of obscuration , their spectral energy distributions are inconsistent with extinction by a foreground screen of dust , and the ultra - violet continua of these objects ( @xmath165 erg s@xmath3 ) are too strong to be due to the host galaxy .",
    "the most likely explanation is that we observe the continuum source through patchy obscuration or reprocessed by scattering in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy or perhaps in the dusty outflow itself .",
    "hamann et al .",
    "( in prep . , 2016a ) demonstrate that extremely red quasars such as the ones we study here are likely more common than are hot dust - obscured galaxies ( hotdogs ) .",
    "hotdogs , in turn , appear to be as common as type 1 quasars of the same bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "if our subsequent observations demonstrate that the [ oiii ] kinematics we see in these four sources are common for the extremely red quasars , this would imply that the `` blow - out '' phase may be a common phase in evolution of extremely luminous quasars . whether every massive galaxy undergoes a period of such luminous quasar activity is not yet known .",
    "but it is clear that with observed velocities and energetics of gas removal , such winds could have a profound impact on the evolution of galaxies in which they occur , in a direct manifestation of quasar feedback on their hosts .",
