    "citrus variegated chlorosis ( cvc ) is an economically relevant disease affecting citrus  @xcite . in the so paulo region ( brazil ) , one of the important citrus growing areas of the world , responsible for about @xmath0 of the world production , cvc reduces the size and number of fruits by more than @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "cvc is considered to be potentially the most devastating citrus disease and represents the main threat to the brazilian citrus industry , with annual revenues of the order of @xmath2 to @xmath3 billions of dollars .",
    "the losses associated with the disease are estimated in about @xmath4 millions dollar yearly  @xcite .",
    "cvc is caused by a xylem - limited bacterium , _ xyllela fastidiosa _",
    "@xcite , transmitted by xylem feeding , suctorial sharpshooter leafhoppers ( hemiptera : cicadellidae )  @xcite . in so paulo ,",
    "the species _ dilobopterus costalimai _ appears to be the most efficient vector for cvc transmission  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , a sweet orange cultivar resistant to _ x. fastidiosa _ is unknown , and control practices for cvc ( bactericidal agents , systematic pruning of infected branches , chemical control of vectors , and/or rouging of severe affected plants ) are expensive , ineffective , or environmentally damaging .",
    "recent studies on various aspects of the epidemiology of cvc ( @xcite , and references therein ) have provided fundamental information which can be used to develop a cellular automata ( ca ) model of the pathosystem .",
    "ca or other epidemic models could become relevant tools to address numerous practical and experimental questions : forecasting the progress and final intensity of cvc , planning and evaluation of strategies for disease control and determination of the relevant mechanisms involved in the disease spreading .    in this paper , we propose a simple ca model to simulate the cvc progress in which some epidemiological and environmental features , such as vectors motility , plant stress and seasonal modulations are included .",
    "the simulational results are compared with the cvc progress curves in time and spatial infection patterns observed in the so paulo region .",
    "the cvc epidemic was observed by visual assessments of typical symptoms occurring on leaves or fruits , in eleven groves of pra , hamlin and natal sweet oranges cultivated in two farms of the northern areas ( bebedouro and colina counties ) of so paulo state , brazil . in such areas ,",
    "severely attacked by cvc , are planted the more susceptible cultivars having the supposedly more propitious age for disease development .",
    "the field data were collected over a 20-month period , from september , 1994 through march , 1996 . the cvc incidence were bimonthly mapped and the data for each area and each evaluation were transformed to proportion of symptomatic plants for temporal characterization of the disease spreading .",
    "the cvc progress curves are shown , for four different groves , in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "all of them are double sigmoid , which is a clear indication that cvc is a polycyclic disease characterized by the existence of two phases : one in which the disease spreading is fast , contrasted by another one in which the epidemic development is almost stopped . for each grove the observed data sets",
    "are fitted by five parameter logistic curves  @xcite of the form    @xmath5}.\\ ] ]    table 1 gives the corresponding parameters and the coefficients of determination ( @xmath6 ) have been listed .",
    "in addition to the @xmath6 coefficient , the residual sums of squares for error and the consistency of the predict values for the upper asymptotic fraction of diseased plants ( @xmath7 ) were take into account to select the logistic among the gompertz and monomolecular generalized models with four or five parameters .",
    "it is important to notice that sigmoid curves can be generated by distinct models ( fitting equations ) .",
    "indeed , the temporal increase of citrus tristeza virus , whose vectors are aphid species , follows a nonlinear gompertz model  @xcite .      on any one of the orangeries containing about @xmath8 trees",
    "there is no unique inoculum source .",
    "each single infected plant or small initial group of infected plants grows by inoculating its adjacent neighbors , and aggregates with other affected trees , forming large clusters . as a result ,",
    "the mean cluster size of infected trees increases in time and , in order to describe the disease spreading , it is necessary to investigate the dynamic aspects of the distribution of infected plant aggregates generated by cvc progress .",
    "a cluster of diseased plants have been defined as any set of interconnected infected trees which are spatially isolated from any other group of diseased plants in the orangery .",
    "then , the cluster size distribution function @xmath9 is the fraction of these clusters consisting of @xmath10 infected plants at time @xmath11 , and were directly obtained by counting the number and size of diseased clusters present in the spatial patterns of cvc epidemic , like those shown in figure [ fig2 ] , at each observation time .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the distribution @xmath9 for one of the observed orangeries .",
    "it suggests that @xmath9 follows a power - law distribution , that is , @xmath12 , over at least one decade of their argument @xmath10 at any given time of cvc progress .",
    "a power - law distribution indicates the absence of a characteristic scale for the size of diseased plant aggregates .",
    "the exponents describing the power - law decay of @xmath9 have values between @xmath3 and @xmath13 for all the studied orangeries .",
    "these values are characteristic of an @xmath14 noise  @xcite , as are commonly referred the @xmath15 spectra with @xmath16 in the interval @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the cvc infection dynamics has an @xmath14-like signal , which , from the physical point of view , is a sign of a cooperative phenomenon occurring in a spatially extended nonequilibrium system .",
    "self - affine profiles  @xcite can be generated from the spatial patterns of diseased plants using various methods .",
    "the simplest of them is the 1:1 mapping between a given spatial configuration at time @xmath11 , such as those shown in figure [ fig2 ] , and a `` walk process ''  @xcite . in this method",
    "each binary symbol @xmath18 , describing the plant state ( @xmath19 : normal ; @xmath20 : diseased ) is identificated with a step ( to the right or to the left ) of a one - dimensional walk .    specifically , to an unique spatial pattern @xmath21 of @xmath22 plants at fixed time @xmath11 , corresponds a profile given by the sequence of the walker displacements @xmath23 after @xmath24 unit steps , @xmath25 , defined as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 if @xmath28 ( step to the right ) , or @xmath29 if @xmath30 ( step to the left ) .",
    "profiles generated at two distinct observation times in a given orangery using this walk process are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "obtained the profiles by the walk process , we can investigate the nature of their correlations through the analysis of the profile roughness  @xcite .",
    "the statistical measure @xmath31 , which characterizes the roughness of the walk profile , is defined by the rms fluctuation in the displacement    @xmath32 ^ 2}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath33    is the mean displacement of the walk .    for self - affine profiles",
    "the roughness @xmath34 will be described by a power law scaling    @xmath35    with the exponent @xmath36 restricted to the interval @xmath37 $ ] and related to the fractal dimension of the profile  @xcite .",
    "@xmath38 corresponds to a random walk ; @xmath39 implies that the profile presents persistent correlations , and profiles with @xmath40 are anticorrelated .",
    "as one can see in figure [ fig4 ] , the profiles generated from the cvc epidemic patterns usually have drifts .",
    "this is the reason why we use the method of roughness around the rms straight line  @xcite to evaluate the hurst exponent @xmath36 . in this method",
    "the roughness @xmath41 in the scale @xmath42 is given by    @xmath43    and the local roughness @xmath44 is defined as    @xmath45\\}^2}.\\ ] ]    @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the linear fitting coefficients to the displacement data on the interval @xmath48 $ ] centered on the site @xmath24 .",
    "again , self - affine profiles satisfy the scaling law    @xmath49    the method described here was used to characterize the spatio - temporal patterns generated by elementary one - dimensional deterministic cellular automata  @xcite .",
    "a typical log - log plot of @xmath50 used to calculate the hurst exponent is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "this exponent characterizes the spatial patterns generated by cvc epidemic .",
    "for all the analyzed orangeries the profiles are self - affine with hurst exponents markedly distinct from @xmath51 , which means long - range correlations present in the spatial disease patterns . also , the roughness exponents increases from a initial value around @xmath51 , indicating a random infection pattern at the beginning , towards its maximum value @xmath52 which corresponds to a totally infected orangery .",
    "thus our results show that cvc epidemic gives rise to aggregated patterns in which the inoculum level tends to be high in scattered sequences of neighboring plants , i. e. , infected plants tends to be close to another diseased trees and the same holds for normal plants .",
    "therefore , it appears that the pathogen occurs in small clusters which progressively expands by a contagion process mediated by vectors which predominantly spreads from plant to plant .",
    "stochastic ca models were used before in plant pathology to simulate diseases spreading through spore dispersal  @xcite , infection dynamics of _ r. solani _  @xcite and infection of cereal roots by the take - all fungus  @xcite , but traditionally the mathematical modeling of plant disease is based on systems of differential equations  @xcite .",
    "cas are totally discrete dynamical systems ( discrete space , discrete time and discrete number of states ) which provide simple models for a great number of problems in science  @xcite . with each site ( noted @xmath24 ) , is associated a variable @xmath53 , which can be in @xmath54 different states @xmath55 .",
    "the dynamics is defined , at each time step , by rules depending on the values at previous time of \\{@xmath53 } associated with a given number of @xmath56 arbitrary sites ( called inputs ) .",
    "usually one considers regular lattices and the inputs refer to the sites on the local neighborhood only .",
    "the local rules of a ca may be probabilistic or deterministic and the sites are simultaneously updated .    in order to design the ca model for cvc spreading , we take into account the following basic features of cvc pathosystem characterized in the previous section .",
    "the bacterium _",
    "x. fastidiosa _ is transmitted by sharpshooter vectors of rather limited motility in the groves .",
    "this hypothesis is coherent with the results obtained for the roughness or hurst exponents describing the cvc infection patterns . in diseased plants ,",
    "the bacterium is systemic , nutritional unbalance and general weakness are commonly observed .",
    "thus , the infected sites continuously act as inoculum sources to other healthy plants .",
    "since there was no measured effect of wind direction or machine based cultural practices on cvc spreading  @xcite , the vectors flies were assumed to be completely random in our model .",
    "also , in healthy stressed trees the observed sharpshooter population is small , since these insects are preferable attracted by plants with new vegetative growth",
    ". finally , as shown by the cvc progress curves , seasonal effects play a central role in disease spreading .",
    "in fact , the fastest cvc spreading progress is observed from september / october ( flowerage ) through march ( end of summer ) , a period associated to high temperatures , regular rains and vegetative growth .",
    "the seasonal modulations are included in the ca model through the variation in the motility of sharpshooter vectors as well as in the fraction of normal plants under hydric and nutritional stress .",
    "the functional form assumed to model such seasonal variations in our model is a sine wave function .    in our ca model",
    "the orangery is represented by square lattices of linear size @xmath57 with null fixed boundary conditions ( isolated grove , i. e. , all the state variables are zero outside the lattice ) .",
    "the state of each plant is described by two binary variables : @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 represents a healthy ( normal ) plant and @xmath62 a diseased plant . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath63 represents a plant under hydric or nutritional stress and @xmath64 a non - stressed plant .",
    "finally , the fraction of inoculative vectors in each site is also represented by a binary variable @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 means a low fraction of inoculative sharpshooter leafhoppers in the insect population and @xmath67 a high inoculative fraction .    in all simulations ,",
    "random initial conditions in which any plant of the lattice is diseased , with probability @xmath68 , and stressed , with probability @xmath69 , have been used .",
    "since cvc causes severe stress in a diseased plant  @xcite , a infected tree ( @xmath62 ) becomes immediately stressed ( @xmath70 ) in our model .",
    "all the sites are simultaneously updated using the following local rules :    \\i ) for an infected site the correspondent state at the next time step is @xmath62 , @xmath70 ( diseased and stressed tree ) and @xmath67 ( high fraction of inoculative vectors ) .",
    "in addition , as shown in figure [ fig6 ] ,",
    "each infected site acts as an inoculum source for @xmath71 distinct plants at distance @xmath72 , @xmath73 , chosen at random accordingly a symmetric lvy distribution    @xmath74    thus , the lengths of each one of the @xmath71 vector flights are not constant but rather are chosen from a probability distribution with a power - law tail .",
    "each one of these selected neighbors will assume , at the next time step , the state @xmath62 , @xmath70 and @xmath67 , if it is a normal and non - stressed plant .",
    "otherwise , the selected neighbor will stay in the same previous state .",
    "thus , in our ca model a healthy stressed tree is not infected by cvc , since their main vectors ( _ dilobopterus costalimai _ and _ acrogonia sp .",
    "_ ) are preferentially observed in plants exhibiting young buds and leaves .",
    "in contrast , a healthy and non - stressed plant becomes diseased if it is reached by inoculative vectors coming from at least one infected site .",
    "\\ii ) for a normal ( stressed or non - stressed ) plant not target by a given diseased plant , the correspondent state at the next time step is @xmath75 ( normal ) and @xmath66 ( low fraction of inoculative vectors ) . yet , the value of @xmath64 or @xmath52 is chosen at random with probability @xmath76 .",
    "\\iii ) in order to simulate the seasonal effects on both , plant stress and vectors motility , the number of inoculative vector flights @xmath71 , and the probability associated to a non - stressed plant @xmath77 are periodic functions of time given by : @xmath78;\\ ] ] @xmath79 where int means the integer part , @xmath80 is the time average number of inoculative vector flights , @xmath81 is the minimum probability to find a non - stressed plant , and @xmath82 is the period of one year .",
    "@xmath83 is a common phase angle to describe possible time shifts between the simulated and field data .    at last",
    ", we shall discuss some simplifications of our ca model for cvc progress .",
    "the use of a symmetric periodic function to model the seasonal effects should be thought as a rough approximation to the much more complex climatic variations observed in nature .",
    "another simplification is that once infected a given plant immediately acts as an inoculum source , in contrast to the classical notion of a discontinuous infectious period .",
    "it is known that the spread of disease involves the interplay of two dynamical processes : the mechanisms of transmission and the evolution of the pathogen within hosts .",
    "the basic questions on how the bacterium spread within the xylem system and what is the mechanism of pathogenesis in cvc are unanswered .",
    "particularly , it seems that the cvc symptoms in plants depend on the rate and extent of colonization by the bacteria .",
    "also , a recent study  @xcite shows that an efficient transmission of _ xylella fastidiosa _ by vectors occurs only after its population overcome a threshold in plant hosts .",
    "in addition , the transmission rate increases as the bacterial population in a plant increases . these features are not included in our ca model due to the lack of information about the system _ xylella fastidiosa _ in citrus .",
    "now we shall report on the simulational results for our ca model . in all simulations a linear size @xmath84 , a seasonal period @xmath85 months ( one year ) and a phase angle @xmath86 ( a shift of two months between the observed and the simulation initial times ) were used .",
    "the remaining five ca parameters , namely , @xmath80 , @xmath68 , @xmath81 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 were varied in order to compare the simulated and observed cvc progress curves .",
    "the results for four groves are shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "as one can see , the qualitative behavior of the ca progress curves show the same functional behavior of the measured curves .",
    "even a surprisingly quantitative agreement between the ca and the observed cvc progress curves was obtained .",
    "the ca parameters values are listed in table 2 .",
    "therefore our simulation results suggest that the lvy distribution of vectors flights is universal , with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the same holds true for @xmath80 , the time average number of sharpshooter vectors flies starting from each infected plant , which assumed a value @xmath91 for all four simulated groves .    at this point , it is interesting to note that our ca model predicts even triple , quadruple or superior sigmoid progress curves depending on the time elapsed up to a total infection of the grove .",
    "this simulational prediction can be easily tested simply by observing the cvc progress in field for a period greater than @xmath92 months as done in the present work . moreover ,",
    "such triple or quadruple sigmoid curves could be mathematically modeled by using generalized logistic , monomolecular or gompertz functions only if the disease progress curves were subdivided into three or four parts that are analyzed separately . however , this approach is inadequate to describe the entire disease dynamics and to determine several parameters of epidemiological importance  @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig8 ] , it is shown a simulated temporal sequence of cvc incidence maps qualitatively similar to the observed spatial patterns of cvc ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) . from such incidence maps , one can determine the dynamic infected cluster size distribution function , @xmath9 , and the roughness exponent @xmath36 characterizing the self - affinity of cvc infection profiles .",
    "figures [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] show , respectively , the cluster size distribution functions @xmath9 , and typical log - log plots of @xmath93 corresponding to the simulated infection maps for the grove sj71 at various observation times .",
    "both , the power - law decay of the infected cluster size distribution functions and the roughness exponents characterizing the spatial disease patterns , indicate the presence of long - range correlations in the cvc development .",
    "roughness exponents greater than @xmath51 mean that in the neighborhood of a diseased plant the probability to find another infected tree increases .",
    "a significative aggregation of diseased plants suggest that the pathogen predominantly spreads from plant to plant . since our ca model permits fast simulations of many large samples of artificial cvc pathosystems under various epidemiological contexts , the numerical values for the exponents @xmath94 and @xmath36 can be determined with a reliable statistical precision difficultly attained in actual field observations .",
    "it is important to emphasize that a simple random walk distribution for the inoculative vector flights constrained to a local neighborhood of radius @xmath95 around each diseased plant , also generates progress curves in good agreement with the field data .",
    "however , the resulting cvc incidence maps are clearly distinct from the observed ones .",
    "random flights of inoculative vectors produce spots of diseased plants artificially isolated in space , which grow up to merge with other infected clusters .",
    "in contrast , a lvy distribution permits rare long range vector flights which appears to be an essential feature to explain the scale invariance observed in cvc spreading . indeed , conventional random walks used to model foraging behavior in biology  @xcite predict a poisson instead of a scale - invariant power - law distribution .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the inoculative sharpshooter leafhoppers ( @xmath96 in size ) perform long flights of random foraging , searching for non - stressed plants with new vegetative growth unpredictably dispersed over several square kilometers .",
    "a possible explanation is that for insects operating in swarms or flocks comprised of @xmath22 walkers , lvy flight search patterns ( for which @xmath97 sites are visited after @xmath11 steps ) are much more efficient than brownian walk foraging patterns ( for which only @xmath98 distinct sites are visited )  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to mention that lvy flight search strategies are also observed in albatrosses  @xcite .",
    "in this study the spatio - temporal analysis of cvc spreading was carried out .",
    "the shape of the observed cvc progress curves was double sigmoid best fitted by five parameters generalized logistic function .",
    "this means that cvc is a polyciclic disease in which a phase of rapid progress alternates with another one of almost paralyzes .",
    "in addition , both the power - law decay of the infected cluster size distribution functions and the roughness exponents characterizing the spatial disease patterns , indicate the presence of long - range correlations in the cvc development .    in order to understand the basic mechanisms by which the features discussed above emerge , a ca model was proposed .",
    "it takes into account the motility of sharpshooter vectors , the hydric and nutritional level of plant stress , as well as seasonal climatic effects .",
    "varying the ca parameters controlling these factors , a good agreement among simulational and all the observational data was achieved , suggesting that the actual relevant mechanisms of cvc spreading were really captured and evidenced by the evolution rules of the proposed ca model .",
    "therefore , our model suggest that the average number @xmath71 of lvy flights performed by the sharpshooter vectors as well as plant stress , described by the probability @xmath99 , are the most fundamental parameters determining the aspects of cvc spreading . also , all of them are affected by seasonal variations .",
    "this work was partially supported by the cnpq , and fapemig - brazilian agencies .                                                        * table 1 * coefficients of determination @xmath6 and estimated values of the five parameters describing the generalized logistic functions used to fit the observed data of cvc progress in four of the studied groves ."
