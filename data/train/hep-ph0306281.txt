    "so far most phenomenological studies on production and decay of supersymmetric ( susy ) particles have been performed within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite with real susy parameters . in this contribution",
    "we analyze the decays of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the mssm with complex susy parameters .",
    "the lighter squark mass eigenstates may be relatively light and could be thoroughly studied at an @xmath8 linear collider .    in the third generation sfermion sector the mixing between the left and right states can not be neglected because of the effects of the large yukawa couplings .",
    "the left - right mixing terms in the squark mass matrix depend on the higgsino mass parameter @xmath2 and the trilinear scalar couplings @xmath9 , @xmath10 , which may be complex in general . in msugra - type models the phase @xmath11 of @xmath2 turns out to be restricted by the experimental data on electron , neutron and mercury electric dipole moments ( edms ) to a range @xmath12  0.2 for an universal scalar mass parameter @xmath13  gev @xcite .",
    "however , the restriction due to the electron edm can be circumvented if complex lepton flavour violating terms are present in the slepton sector @xcite .",
    "the phases of the parameters @xmath14 are not restricted at one - loop level by the edm data but only at two - loop level , resulting in much weaker constraints on these phases @xcite .",
    "analyses of the decays of the 3rd generation squarks @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the mssm with real parameters were performed in refs .",
    "@xcite and phenomenological studies of production and decay of these particles at future @xmath8 colliders in ref .",
    "a detailed study how to determine @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the real mssm with help of the measured polarization of final state top quarks was performed in ref .",
    "recently the influence of complex phases on the phenomenology of third generation sleptons has been studied in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study the effects of the complex phases of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the partial decay widths and branching ratios of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we assume , that the gaugino mass parameters are real .",
    "especially the effects of the possibly large phases of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be quite strong , which would have an important impact on the search for @xmath3 and @xmath4 at a future @xmath8 linear collider .",
    "the left - right mixing of the stops and sbottoms is described by a hermitian @xmath19 mass matrix , which in the basis @xmath20 reads @xmath21 with @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mass , electric charge and weak isospin of the quark @xmath26 .",

    "we calculate the partial decay widths in born approximation .",
    "it is known that in some cases the one - loop susy qcd corrections are important .",
    "the analyses of @xcite suggest that a significant part of the one - loop susy qcd corrections to certain @xmath3 and @xmath4 partial decay widths can be incorporated by using an appropriately corrected bottom quark mass . in this spirit",
    "we calculate the tree - level widths of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays by using on - shell masses for the kinematic factors , whereas we take running masses for the top and bottom quark for the yukawa couplings . for definiteness",
    "we take @xmath46  gev , @xmath47  gev , @xmath48  gev and @xmath49  gev .",
    "this approach leads to an `` improved '' born approximation , which takes into account an essential part of the one - loop susy qcd corrections to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 partial decay widths and predicts their phase dependences more accurately than the `` naive '' tree - level calculation .    in the numerical analysis",
    "we impose the following conditions in order to fulfill the experimental constraints : @xmath50  gev , @xmath51  gev , @xmath52  gev , @xmath53  gev , @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the branching ratio for @xmath56 and compare it with the experimentally allowed range @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "first we discuss the dependence of the @xmath3 partial decay widths on @xmath58 and @xmath59 in two scenarios inspired by the snowmass points and slopes scenarios sps  1a and sps  4 @xcite . for this",

    "the relevant parameters for the determination of the partial decay widths are summarized in table  [ scentab ] .",
    "furthermore , we also look at a scenario with a light @xmath3 allowing production of this particle at a 500  gev linear collider . when varying the phases of @xmath0 and @xmath2 we fix three squark masses and the absolute values of the parameters at the given values , calculating @xmath37 , @xmath34 and @xmath38 accordingly",

    "the decay pattern , especially of @xmath65 , can be explained in the following way : in all scenarios we have @xmath80 , therefore @xmath81 depends only weakly on @xmath58 .",

    "the @xmath58 dependence is stronger than the @xmath59 dependence .",
    "the reason is that these phase dependences are caused by the @xmath92 -@xmath93 mixing term ( eq .  ( [ mlrterm ] ) ) , where the @xmath59 dependence is suppressed .",
    "the @xmath59 dependence is somewhat more pronounced for @xmath87 than for @xmath94 .",
