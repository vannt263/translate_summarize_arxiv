    "<S> we need @xmath148 or , equivalently , @xmath149 .    in conclusion , weakly interacting low - dimensional bose - bose mixtures manifest themselves as promising candidates for studying liquid phases in the ultracold ultradilute regime and associated beyond - mean - field effects . we find that in the two - dimensional case the liquid phase is formed whenever the intraspecies interactions are repulsive and the interspecies one is attractive . </S>",
    "<S> this differs from the three - dimensional case where @xmath150 should be larger than @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the one - dimensional mixture liquefies for @xmath152 ; this effect is completely missed by the mean - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , one - dimensional droplets can be described analytically and it is tempting to study their dynamical and transport properties . in any dimension </S>",
    "<S> the almost complete cancellation of the first - order terms in the energy functional of the liquid gives one an opportunity to test higher - order terms and their universality . </S>",
