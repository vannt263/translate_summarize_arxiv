    "the notion of relative locality was originally proposed as a response to criticisms to double special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite , a modification of special relativity proposed as a step towards quantum gravity .",
    "dsr proposes the replacement of the poincar symmetry group of sr by the @xmath0poincar group , while preserving relativity of inertial frames .",
    "the practical consequence of the modification is the introduction of an universal invariant energy scale ( planck scale ) along with the invariant velocity , @xmath1 .",
    "+   + there are compelling arguments to believe that 2 + 1 gravity is a dsr theory . indeed , when coupled to point particles , the theory has @xcite    a universal mass limit independent of the number of particles ;    a noncommutative spacetime poisson algebra ;    a non - linear 3-momentum addition rule ;    a curved 3-momentum space ;    all of which are characteristics of a dsr theory .",
    "+   + one of the main criticisms of dsr is its apparent violation of locality .",
    "the construction used to support this claim is the study of a particle collision : if two worldlines intersect in some inertial frame , then there exists a class of inertial observers for which the worldlines do _ not _ cross @xcite .",
    "that is , the notion of locality is no longer invariant - an interaction that is local for an observer can be non - local for a different one - a feature that naturally raised concerns about the theory , since it seemed to indicate a fundamental subjectivity of reality , violating the principle of equivalence .",
    "+   + the concept of relative locality was suggested to argue this is not the case , by proposing that the violation of locality present in dsr theories is not real , but a consequence of misinterpreting the geometry of reality , due to taking spacetime to be an absolute , invariant entity - an assumption motivated by our knowledge and intuition , but effectively unwarranted .",
    "compare this situation with the problem of simultaneity in sr - the statement of two events occurring at the same time for one observer being located at different times for a different one stems from abandoning the newtonian notion of absolute time . in the framework of relative locality , it is the absoluteness of spacetime that is abandoned .",
    "+   + relative locality is a change of paradigm with the intention of better understanding quantum gravity . in this context , the problem of studying the properties of feynman diagrams of a field theory according to the new framework becomes of major importance .",
    "a natural first step to approach it is to describe how our understanding of particle interactions changes in the simpler context of classical mechanics , which is the main topic of the present essay .",
    "as observers immersed in the universe , notions of space and time are intuitive to us .",
    "we immediately interpret the localization of objects around us in terms of distances , and perceive the ordering of events and the concept of cause and effect as result of the passage of time . perhaps",
    "because these concepts are so natural and intuitive , all physical theories to date take them as fundamental rather than `` emergent '' from deeper structures .",
    "but considering more carefully the mechanisms through which we probe spacetime , we see that within them are the seeds for a drastic change of perspective .",
    "+   + consider a simple example - measuring the length of a bar .",
    "an observer `` sees '' the bar by receiving photons from it - optical mechanisms convert them in information interpretable by the brain as an image . and ,",
    "indeed , knowing the time each of two photons , one from each end of the bar , takes to reach the eye , together with the direction in which they were sent , one can derive the length of the bar from basic geometric considerations . +     of the bar using the data @xmath2 obtained from photons . ]    in more abstract terms , the observer performed a distance measurement using only a calorimeter for photon detection and a clock for time measurement .",
    "the same line of thought can be applied to other measurements ( velocity , acceleration ... ) , in a way that suggests that the fundamental experimental apparatuses are the calorimeter and the clock - and we effectively probe spacetime through exchange of energy - momentum _ quanta_. +   + put this way , it seems almost natural to propose that the `` arena '' where physical processes happen is not spacetime , but energy - momentum space .",
    "spacetime becomes a construction , an auxiliary entity derived by observers from physical interactions .",
    "as such , there is no reason to assume this constructed spacetime is independent of energy and momentum ( the parameters of a dsr change of frame ) , so in general it can be observer - dependent - which , as will be illustrated below , leads to locality of an interaction being itself relative to the observer . +   + the change of paradigm described above leads to the formulation of the principle of relative locality . quoting @xcite : +   +      any theory of quantum gravity must have as fundamental quantities planck s constant , @xmath3 , and newton s constant , @xmath4 . taking different limits of these ,",
    "we obtain different experimental regimes of gravity : taking @xmath5 leads us to classical general relativity , while considering @xmath6 should recover special - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "but there is a third limit that can be taken , if we notice that the two fundamental constants can be combined to form the planck mass @xmath7 : taking @xmath8 while keeping @xmath9 finite . in this regime , since the effects of classical gravity and special - relativistic quantum mechanics are negligible , the geometry of spacetime is minkowski and one can work in the classical mechanics formalism ; short - distance quantum phenomena should be irrelevant as well since the planck length is @xmath10 however , the presence of the planck scale indicates that novel quantum gravity effects could occur at energies of order @xmath9 , possibly resulting in a nontrivial geometry of momentum space .",
    "+   + in line with taking momentum space @xmath11 as fundamental , our phase space will be its cotangent bundle , @xmath12 .",
    "spacetime at a given point in @xmath11 is the cotangent space to @xmath11 at that point , which we denote by @xmath13 . while we will not discuss it here",
    ", one can speculate that when @xmath14 and @xmath3 are present ( the hypothetical full quantum gravity theory ) , the geometry of the whole phase space is something much more complex , intertwining spacetime and momentum space in a nontrivial fiber bundle . +      our observer can construct the metric of momentum space through two classes of measurements :    * determining the rest mass of a particle gives the geodesic distance of its position in @xmath11 to the origin , @xmath15 * on the other hand , a measurement of kinetic energy @xmath16 gives the distance between the moving particle s momentum , @xmath17 and that of the same particle at rest , @xmath18 : @xmath19    this information is sufficient to recover the metric of momentum space , @xmath20      considering interaction processes between point particles , it becomes evident that a combination rule for momenta is necessary , since it is through `` addition '' that the principle of conservation of momentum is expressed .",
    "we will look into this in more detail in section 3 , but in its essence the addition rule is a map @xmath21 which can be experimentally determined from particle collision processes , where total momentum is conserved .",
    "for very low energies , it should reduce to the usual linear addition , @xmath22 , but in the spirit of dsr , we will assume that in general it is not linear .",
    "but if @xmath23 is not linear , there is no reason to assume it is commutative or even associative - and we will not do so .",
    "however , to turn incoming momenta into outgoing and vice - versa while analyzing point particle interactions , we will require an inversion map , i.e. to assume that each momentum @xmath17 has a reciprocal @xmath24 satisfying both the left and right inverse conditions : @xmath25 @xmath23 is directly related to the notion of a connection in @xmath11 , since it can be used to define parallel transport of a vector . as shown in figure 2 , the parallel transport of the vector field @xmath17 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 results in their combination @xmath28 , which admits the following expansion for small @xmath17 assuming @xmath29 is infinitesimal : @xmath30        the definition of the connection of momentum space is then natural : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is simply the addition rule with the neutral element shifted from 0 to @xmath33 , which has the expression @xmath34 and satisfies @xmath35 ( analogous to @xmath36 ) .",
    "+   + one important property of our constructions of the metric and connection of momentum space is that they are independent of one another - they result from different measurements .",
    "this means that , in general , the connection and the metric might not be compatible .",
    "we can quantify the incompatibility using the _ non - metricity tensor _",
    ", @xmath37 it is possible to decompose the full connection in terms of the levi - civita connection , the torsion and the non - metricity . to do this , decompose the connection components in their symmetric and antisymmetric parts with respect to the top indices : @xmath38}=\\left\\ { _ { \\,\\ , c}^{ab}\\right\\ } + \\frac{1}{2}t_{c}^{ab}+\\mathcal{n}_{c}^{ab}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is symmetric in the top indices .",
    "now it can be shown using the definition of covariant derivative that ( defining the covariant torsion @xmath40 ) @xmath41 so that the connection can be written as @xmath42      from the connection introduced above , we can construct the riemann tensor of momentum space .",

    "consider a system of _ n _ point particles labeled by indices @xmath44 interacting locally at vertices @xmath45 , with worldlines @xmath46 .",
    "this system is described by the action @xcite @xmath47 in this expression , we introduce spacetime coordinates @xmath48 as elements of @xmath49 canonically dual to the momenta , satisfying the poisson brackets @xmath50 .",
    "the metric of spacetime plays no role though ; only the metric of momentum space appears in the action through the constraints @xmath51 which specify the particle masses .",
    "the interaction term imposes conservation of momentum in each vertex @xmath45 through the constraints @xmath52 , which depend on the vertex endpoints of the interacting worldlines and are related via equations of motion to the interaction coordinates @xmath53 in spacetime .",
    "the free equations of motion for this action , @xmath54 are analogous to the usual spacetime - centered perspective in classical mechanics .",
    "there are two more equations to be derived though - we can still vary the @xmath55 and the @xmath56 at the interaction vertices .",
    "* varying with respect to @xmath53 results in the momentum conservation constraints in each vertex , given by @xmath57 * varying with respect to @xmath56 results in the _ relative locality relations _ between the location in spacetime of the worldline endpoints and the vertex coordinates : @xmath58 where the @xmath59 sign refers to incoming particles and @xmath60 to outgoing ones . note that this variation requires paying attention to whether the corresponding worldline is incoming or outgoing with respect to the vertex , i.e. assuming for simplicity that @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 or @xmath63 if the particle is incoming or outgoing respectively .    from the relative locality relations we see",
    "that not only do the worldline endpoints in spacetime not coincide with the vertex location , but , since the operators @xmath64 are related to parallel transport ( as we will see in more detail later ) , they do so in a way that directly reflects the fact that the different particles are in `` different spacetimes '' . for very low energies ( small momenta ) , we recover the usual notion of locality , @xmath65 . +   + for the following , we will require some definitions and two useful results .",
    "the aforementioned addition rule for momenta defines left- and right- translation operators : @xmath66 based on our interpretation of parallel transport through addition described in section 2.2 , it is natural to define parallel transport operators as derivatives of the translation operators : @xmath67 @xmath68 we define an additional operator as the derivative of the inversion map @xmath69 : @xmath70 note that @xmath71 are diffeomorphisms in @xmath11 , while @xmath72 are linear operators in @xmath73 , and that the usual chain rule of differentiation applies , @xmath74 diffeomorphisms in @xmath11 ] .",

    "there are two momenta in the corresponding diagram - one incoming and one outgoing , as figure 4 illustrates :        physically , we do not expect relative locality to introduce any effects in this situation , since any worldline of a free particle can be broken into segments separated by bivalent vertices , introducing momentum constraints in each one - and we do not expect the different worldline segments created by this process to be in different spacetimes .",
    "let us verify this in practice by computing the relative locality relations . write the conservation rule as @xmath93 the relative locality operators are @xmath94 where we used the momentum constraint to simplify results . using , we get @xmath95 , so that the worldline endpoint coordinates are @xmath96 and the `` interaction '' is local to every observer - the only effect of a coordinate change is to alter its location with respect to the chosen frame , as one would expect in ordinary special relativity . +   +",
    "much more interesting is the case of the trivalent vertex , which can represent physical situations such as the decay of one particle into two or the fusion of two particles .",
    "this is the simplest situation where we expect relative locality to introduce novel effects , and it will be the primary kind of vertex studied in the following sections .",
    "a generic momentum constraint @xmath97 can naively be written as @xmath98 generalizing the usual linear conservation laws .",
    "however , because the addition rule is in general non - commutative and non - associative , is ambiguous : while in the linear case the ordering of additions is naturally irrelevant , in this more general setting it changes the form of the constraint .",
    "it is then important to evaluate if these changes affect the physics of the interaction , and in the event they do , determine a consistent , physical way of choosing vertex orderings .",
    "a bivalent vertex has two possible ways of writing the momentum constraint , @xmath99 or @xmath100 , while a trivalent vertex has 12 , corresponding to all the different permutations and operation orderings of the 3 momenta ( if they are all regarded as incoming for simplicity , some of the possibilities are @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 ... ) .",
    "+   + notice that changing the form of writing a single momentum constraint corresponds effectively to applying a diffeomorphism @xmath104 on the original one .",
    "for example , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the diffeomorphism that relates two different constraints is not unique - we could also have written @xmath107 .",
    "if we proceed under the assumption there should be at least a class of vertex changes that does not affect the physics of the interaction , we should try to find something analogous to a _ gauge transformation _ on our system based on the above considerations , i.e. a redundancy in the definition of momentum constraints and vertex coordinates that does not affect the equations of motion .",
    "indeed , there is such a transformation , as described originally in @xcite : @xmath108 this rewriting neither alters the constraints , since @xmath109 , nor affects the worldline endpoint coordinates given by the relative locality relations : @xmath110 it is clear that the physics of an interaction is unaffected by the map above , which means we can regard it as a gauge symmetry of the theory .",
    "+   + as an application of this idea , consider once again the bivalent vertex . in section 3.1",
    "we used the momentum constraint @xmath111 .",
    "let us see what happens if we use @xmath112 .",
    "the relative locality operators are then @xmath113 so that the worldline endpoint coordinates are given by @xmath114 this can be described as the result of a gauge transformation if we note that @xmath115 and calculate @xmath116^{-1}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & z\\left(v_{0}^{p}i^{\\ominus p}u_{\\ominus p}^{0}\\right)^{-1}=-z\\left(u_{0}^{\\ominus p}u_{\\ominus p}^{0}\\right)^{-1}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & -z.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have seen a simple example of how a certain class of vertex changes do not affect the interaction physics , since it can actually be matched to a redundancy in the definition of the vertex coordinates together with the conservation laws .",
    "however , notice that not all diffeomorphisms corresponding to vertex changes obey the condition @xmath117 : an example was given above , @xmath118 unless @xmath23 is commutative .",
    "these cases motivate further study , and some concrete examples will be given in the next section .",
    "a typical gamma ray burst event consists of a high - energy gamma ray emission followed by an `` afterglow '' of lower energy radiation ( typically x - rays)@xcite .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that observational measurements of phenomena of this kind can serve as a detector of non - metricity and/or torsion of momentum space , via the time delay between the detection of two photons of different energies emitted by the same source and the angle deflection relative to the direction of the sources ( dual gravitational lensing ) , respectively .",
    "we will redo the calculation of @xcite in a slightly different way , to make transparent where a change of vertex could alter the form of the results and/or the physics , and we will consider three possible changes in the form of the momentum constraints and reflect on what the similarities and differences between the calculations in each one are .",
    "+   + the idealized description of the gamma ray burst is summarized in figure 5 .",
    "the `` experimental set - up '' consists of an emitter and a detector , represented by particles with masses @xmath119 respectively .",
    "the emitter sends a photon with energy @xmath120 , and , after a proper time @xmath121 , it sends another photon with energy @xmath122 .",

    "special relativity predicts that , assuming the emitter and the detector are at rest with respect to each other , @xmath126 , the relation between the intervals of emission and detection is the intuitive one , @xmath127 .",

    "this is the gauge freedom of the system , which means we can fix @xmath227 to be whatever we want .",

    "+   + introducing the kinematical and dynamical constraints into the ordinary free - particle hamiltonian , the resulting nonzero poisson brackets of the system are @xmath254      the biggest geometrical difference when applying the above formalism to gravity is the presence of the conical deficits .",
    "this means spacetime is not simply connected , so it is no longer possible to describe the system by global minkowski coordinates - instead , the adm surface is covered by an atlas whose charts are minkowski , since geometry is still flat everywhere outside the particles .",
    "the minkowski charts @xmath255 are chosen so that each one covers a polygon @xmath256 , and for the atlas to be well - defined there must be diffeomorphisms relating two different sets of coordinates in intersecting patches , the transfer functions . since the intersection of two polygons is a link , the transfer functions are labeled by the links , and necessarily correspond to isometries of minkowski space mapping @xmath257 to @xmath104 , of which we will only consider the lorentz rotations @xmath258 .",
    "they relate space coordinates in the two orientations of a link : @xmath259 since the relative positions and the transfer functions contain all information about the shape of the polygons and how to `` glue '' them together to form the adm surface , they effectively encode spacetime geometry - up to redundancy transformations that correspond to diffeomorphism invariance .",

    "two pieces of data are needed :    * the metric of momentum space ; * the combination rule between two momenta .",
    "the metric is easily obtainable from the description of momentum as derived from a particle s holonomy : the constitutive relation can be rewritten in matricial form ( going back to the notation of lower indices for momenta and dropping the @xmath284 subscripts ) @xmath285.\\ ] ] the condition that @xmath286 can be rewritten in the new notation as @xmath287 defining the coordinate @xmath288 , and @xmath289 , we see that this equation is simply the embedding equation of 3-dimensional anti - de sitter space in minkowski space @xmath290 , @xmath291 , where the curvature radius is @xmath292 and the metric of momentum space is readily written in the quasi - cartesian coordinate system we are working in : @xmath293 to derive a momentum addition rule we just have to note that putting together two holonomies @xmath294 ( which corresponds physically to the absorption of a particle by the other ) , the resultant holonomy is simply the group product of the two : @xmath295 . if the corresponding momenta are @xmath296 respectively , we obtain ( denoting @xmath297 and @xmath298 ) @xmath299,\\ ] ] where _",

    "the connection is now obtained from the definition , with the result @xmath302 where @xmath303 are the christoffel symbols of the @xmath304 metric and @xmath305 is the torsion , so the corresponding term in the decomposition vanishes . ] .",
    "we find that the non - metricity tensor vanishes , hence the connection is compatible with the metric .",
    "+   + lastly , we can re - obtain the mass shell constraint using its definition in the relative locality context , .",
    "the geodesic distance @xmath306 is computed in the center of mass frame , by attempting a solution of the form @xmath307 to the geodesic equations , @xmath308 the _ ansatz _ reduces them to one single ode : @xmath309 the solution of respecting the boundary conditions which tends to the flat space linear form when @xmath310 is @xmath311 and the geodesic length is obtained by computing the integral @xmath312 which does satisfy @xmath313 , . +   + the phase space of the 2 + 1 multiparticle system coupled to gravity",
    "is then described as follows : the dynamical variables are the particle s holonomy momenta @xmath314 , where the curvature radius of @xmath11 is @xmath315 , and their dual spacetime coordinates @xmath316 with the geometry of spacetime given by .",
    "the existence of torsion in momentum space results from momentum addition being essentially the @xmath301 group rule , and the fact that it is curved explains the noncommutative structure of spacetime made evident in the algebra .",
    "the constraints on phase space are the mass shell constraints and the positive energy constraint @xmath317 , along with the 2nd class kinematical constraints to the cm frame , which can be made 1st class by the triangulation procedure .",
    "we will now carry out the derivation of the time delay between photon emission and reception for the 2 + 1 multiparticle system .",
    "the calculation follows the same steps performed in section 3.3 , and there are two observations that make our life easier :    * even though we are now working in a different physical regime than in section 3.3 ( @xmath3 is still neglected but @xmath4 is present ) , the fact that spacetime geometry is everywhere flat apart from the conical deficits at the particles locations means the kinematic relations are still valid , as long as we redefine @xmath318 according to the mass shell constraints .",
    "* the fact that @xmath23 is associative results in useful formulas for the parallel transport operators : @xmath319 proof is as follows : @xmath320 , where the associativity of @xmath23 is used to assert that @xmath321 .",
    "calculation for @xmath322 is entirely analogous .",
    "we can also compute the parallel transport operators _ u _ , _ v _ , _ i _ according to the present combination rule : @xmath323 we will now compute the time delay @xmath132 using the momentum constraints as they are given in @xcite .",
    "the formulas greatly simplify the relative locality operators : @xmath324 computing the terms of , we obtain that @xmath325 , an exact cancellation of the lhs , and the following results for the parallel transported momenta : @xmath326 each uppercase momentum only depends on the corresponding lowercase one , and the torsion terms turn out to have no effect . the assumption that @xmath327 and @xmath328 are parallel means simply that @xmath162 .",
    "the calculation of the time delay carries on exactly as done in - and the conclusion is immediate : since from we know that photons are null , @xmath329 , and it results that there is no time delay between the intervals of emission and reception in the 2 + 1 multiparticle model - as we expected from @xcite , since the connection of momentum space is metric .",
    "+   + more surprising is the fact that the _ dual gravitational lensing _ effect derived in @xcite ( angular deviation between the two photons momenta ) is absent as well : since the decomposition implies that @xmath330 for null @xmath331 and @xmath332 , we have @xmath333 .",
    "this is , however , compatible with the result in @xcite for the deflection angle , @xmath334 where @xmath335 , @xmath336 being the null vector giving the direction of @xmath331 and @xmath337 the corresponding covector .",
    "indeed , it can be seen from that @xmath338 so the predicted angular deviation vanishes in the 2 + 1 multiparticle case .",
    "the main goal of the work described in this essay was three - fold : to review the main physical concepts and mathematical formalism behind the principle of relative locality , with particular focus on its application to classical interactions between point particles ( as a first step to eventually study consequences of the new ideas in field theories and ultimately quantum gravity ) ; to examine an apparent problem of the formalism , the ambiguities in defining the momentum constraints of the classical action , and try to understand whether different definitions produce different physics ; and to give an example of how a well - studied system with nontrivial phase space geometry and dynamics , the 2 + 1 multiparticle model in einstein gravity , can be understood in terms of the new framework .",
    "+   + towards the first goal , i tried to give a clear motivation and explanation , based on intuitive ideas , of the material in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "i believe that the main principle is not hard to grasp for anyone with a basic understanding of differential geometry and special relativity , as long as one gets used to thinking in momentum space - not an easy task at all : in the words of leonard susskind , `` only perverts think in momentum space '' , but in this case , it could be an useful perversion .",
    "+   + the second goal saw us making some considerations on the structure of a vertex change , in particular identifying that identity - preserving diffeomorphisms on a momentum constraint are the mark of a gauge transformation involving the @xmath339 and interaction coordinates @xmath340 , therefore just a redundancy in the physical description , and doing several brute - force calculations with different conservation laws based on the gamma delay experiment , which revealed one particular instance where the structure of the derivation is altered - unless torsion effects are not considered .",
    "+   + finally , regarding the third goal , we constructed a picture of phase space that , despite being that of a classical gravity model , is remarkably similar to the description of relative locality s phase space in the limit @xmath129 with a finite planck mass , to the extent where it could be studied using the same language and methods .",
    "the 2 + 1 multiparticle model provided us with an interesting example of a momentum space with a nontrivial but well understood metric ( @xmath304 ) and torsion , but no nonmetricity , and an interpretation of the noncommutative nature of spacetime encoded in the relative locality relations .",
    "+   + as for possible further developments on this work , we did not , by any means , exhaust the treatment of the change of vertex problem .",
    "the first order results presented in section 3.3 illustrated how the analysis of the gamma delay problem seemed to change when the 2nd and 3rd alternatives for momentum constraints were introduced , but it was not completely clear whether that change produced an effective modification in the physics - especially because the original calculation presented in @xcite was done without torsion , and in this limit all discrepancies disappear",
    ". a full calculation of the gamma delay with torsion would probably have shed light on this issue .",
    "alternatively , going to second order and examining the curvature effects could prove enlightening .",
