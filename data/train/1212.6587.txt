    "recently , a large elliptic flow of direct photons , as large as that of hadrons , has been observed in heavy ion collisions , in both phenix experiment at rhic and alice experiment at lhc  @xcite .",
    "such a large elliptic flow of direct photons looks puzzling because the elliptic flow of direct photons was predicted much lower than that of hadrons@xcite .",
    "new sources of direct photons  @xcite have been considered to account for the large elliptic flow .",
    "they should , at one hand be constrained with the observed transverse momentum spectra of direct photons @xcite and hadronic data , at the other hand be tested by higher order harmonics , for example , the triangular flow @xmath7 of direct photons .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the special information carried by direct photons , after being constrained by the data of hadrons in heavy ion experiments .",
    "we will try to explained direct photon data with the delayed formation of the quark gluon plasma(qgp ) in the early stage , following the some early suggestion of two time scales for thermal and chemical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "thus qgp formation time @xmath8 , the moment when the system reaches both thermal and chemical equilibrium locally , will be extracted . in order to make the calculation of direct photons constrained with hadronic data",
    ", we will take ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamical models @xcite , which can give a reasonable description to hadronic data such as rapidity distribution , transverse momentum spectra , elliptic flow , etc .",
    "more than one hydro models are employed , in order to make our conclusions more general . during the whole calculation of direct photons , we will keep the solutions from those hydro models valid , and keep the equation of states consistent .",
    "the paper is organized as following : after a brief introduction of calculate approach of direct photons in section 2 , the results will be presented in section 3 , then conclusion in section 4 .",
    "we will consider direct photons from pbpb collisions at 2.76tev and auau collisions at 200gev .",
    "the sources of direct photons are simplified as prompt photons and thermal photons , according to alice and phenix measurements of direct photons at high transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "prompt photons are calculated to the next - to - leading order contribution in cold nuclear collisions : @xmath9,\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where thickness function @xmath10 , nuclear parton distribution functions @xmath11 and cross sections , are the same as in previous work  @xcite .",
    "no consideration of energy loss in fragmentation functions @xmath12 , in order to compensate the contribution from jet photon conversions .",
    "prompt photons are supposed to carry vanishing elliptic flow .",
    "the @xmath13 spectrum of thermal photons reads @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the photon emission rate at temperature @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the four - momentum of a photon in the lab frame and @xmath19 is the flow velocity .    the hydrodynamical models @xcite provide us the energy density @xmath20 and flow velocity @xmath19 at each space - time point of the system for the calculation .",
    "we get the temperature at each space point according to the equation of state @xmath21 .",
    "we keep those solutions from hydro models valid all the time .",
    "what may be modified is the photon emission rate @xmath22 , how strong photons are emitted .",
    "now we introduce the two time scales in heavy ion collisions , and discuss how photon emission depends on .",
    "the hydrodynamical description of the heavy ion systems starts from an initial time @xmath23 , where a local thermal equilibrium has been assumed to solve the hydro equations .",
    "the high energy density at @xmath23 ensures a partonic phase .",
    "the ratio between quarks and gluons at @xmath23 can not be determined by hadronic data .",
    "it takes time for the system to get chemically equilibrium , thus a qgp may form at a later moment @xmath8 , not at @xmath23 .",
    "quark fugacity @xmath24 is used during ( @xmath23 , @xmath8 ) . a linear increase of quark fugacity @xmath24 from 0 at @xmath23 to unity at @xmath8",
    "is assumed in this work .",
    "the assumption of @xmath25 until @xmath23 is at one hand required by the large elliptic flow of direct photons , at the other hand reasonable from both cgc and epos initial conditions according to initial conditions .",
    "initial condition can be obtained from glauber model@xcite , according to the distribution of nucleons in nuclei , but difficult to extract quark fugacity .",
    "color glass condensate ( cgc ) model provides initial condition according to parton distribution functions@xcite the small @xmath26 physics supports a glue - dominant system and @xmath27 .",
    "event generator epos@xcite can provides an initial condition based on the parallel exchange of pomerons , a kind of color tubes with vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "the longitudinal excited color tubes accommodate easily gluons , which implies @xmath27 at midrapidity . ] .",
    "therefore , during ( @xmath23 , @xmath8 ) , photon emission rate is not the full rate in qgp phase @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the contributions from compton process and annihilation processes , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite , should be modified with a factor of @xmath24 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "bremsstrahlung process with @xmath32-quark lines will be modified with a factor of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "it is difficult to disentangle the contribution of a given @xmath32-quark bremsstrahlung .",
    "therefore we can either ignore bremsstrahlung contributions to get the lower limit , @xmath35 , or overestimate them with @xmath36 .",
    "thus , during ( @xmath23 , @xmath8 ) photon emission rate satisfies @xmath37 , with the lower limit @xmath38 and the upper limit @xmath39    during this stage , there is also a modification of the relation @xmath21 via @xmath40 where partonic degrees of freedom @xmath41 and @xmath42 , a certain increase of the temperature , especially at very small @xmath24 .",
    "but the relation between energy density and pressure remains approximately , so that hydro solutions remain valid .",
    "now let s summarize photon emission along the whole evolution history :    * at @xmath43 , prompt photons are counted according to next to leading order qcd .",
    "* during @xmath44 , we have @xmath25 and photon emission rate @xmath45 . * during @xmath46 , emission will be estimated with @xmath37 .",
    "* for @xmath47 , thermal photon emission rate covers both contribution from the qgp phase and hadronic phase . in qgp phase",
    ", @xmath28 is employed . in hadronic phase ,",
    "the rate is based on massive yang - mills ( mym ) theory@xcite , which takes into account of both nonstrange and strangeness hadronic interactions such as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , etc .",
    "the large elliptic flow of direct photons implies a strong emission in hadronic phase .",
    "therefore , we do nt include the dipole - like form factor in the emission rate as done in most work@xcite .",
    "this is not only favoured by direct photon data , but also because the form factors of those hadrons in strong interactions , or pdf of those hadrons , have not been measured .",
    "mym theory itself remains complete without form factor .",
    "now we introduce how to calculate high order harmonics .",
    "the @xmath13-spectrum of thermal photons can be decomposed into harmonics of azimuthal angle @xmath51 as @xmath52 where @xmath1 ( @xmath53 ) is the elliptic flow ( higher order harmonics ) , and @xmath54 is the @xmath32-th order event plane . obviously , @xmath53 and @xmath54 depend on photon s transverse momentum @xmath13 , and vary event - by - event . from eq",
    "( [ eq : dndphi ] ) , one can easily get @xmath55 let s note their right sides as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . then , in each event one can estimate    @xmath58    make the event average to get @xmath53 of thermal photons and reduce with the factor @xmath59 to get @xmath53 of direct photons .",
    "let s start with pb+pb collisions at @xmath60  tev .",
    "event - by - event thermal photon emission has been calculated based on epos2.17v3@xcite where the initial time @xmath61  fm / c .        in fig.[fig",
    ": fig1 ] , the transverse momentum spectrum and elliptic flow @xmath1 of direct photons from pb+pb collisions at centrality 0 - 40% calculated with @xmath62 0.75 , 1.15 and 1.55  fm / c are compared with the data from alice @xcite . during @xmath46 , the lower emission limit was used in those curves .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] tells us , if qgp is formed at the initial time @xmath23 , then direct photons will be overproduced , and the elliptic flow underestimated .",
    "the underestimation of elliptic flow is consistent to previous work@xcite .",
    "a delayed qgp formation will decrease the early photon emission thus increase the elliptic flow of direct photons , shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the reason is clear .",
    "later emitted photons carry larger elliptic flow , thanks to a longer expansion of the system .",
    "once we reduce the fraction of early emission via delayed qgp formation time , the total elliptic flow will increase .",
    "the dependence of the transverse momentum spectrum and elliptic flow @xmath1 of direct photons on @xmath8 can be shown more clearly in fig .  2 .",
    "the rate during @xmath46 is not known explicitly , but the uncertainty is constrained with the upper ( dashed lines ) and lower ( solid lines ) limits . here",
    "@xmath63gev / c are chosen to present the results , because both transverse momentum spectrum and elliptic flow show sensitivity to @xmath8 here .",
    "besides , the elliptic flow @xmath1 has a peak close to @xmath64gev / c .",
    "we can see a delayed qgp formation can increase the elliptic flow of direct photons , at the same time , can decrease the transverse momentum spectrum . now the direct photon data , extracted from alice data @xcite and shown as full squares , are used to extract the proper qgp formation time . and a reasonable choice of @xmath8 is about 1.5  fm / c .    the rate during @xmath46 is not known explicitly , but the uncertainty makes a theoretic error less than 10% for both the spectrum and elliptic flow of direct photons . in the following , we will not mention but use the low limit of emission rate directly .        in fig .  3 , the harmonics coefficients @xmath53 ( @xmath36 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) of direct photons",
    "are predicted with @xmath65fm / c , accompanied with the alice data points of elliptic flow @xmath1 .",
    "they behave quite similar to those of charged hadrons measured by atlas@xcite .",
    "thus the two - time - scale picture sounds more reasonable than new sources of direct photons to account for the large elliptic flow .      in above case",
    ", each system expands hydrodynamically based on an irregular initial condition and thermal photons are emitted event - by - event .",
    "here we make a connection to an event - averaged calculation .",
    "the latter has an smoothed initial condition , almond - like in the transverse plane .",
    "this can be obtained from the average of the event - by - event initial conditions , with @xmath66 in each event , or parameterized with glauber model .",
    "the regular system expands hydrodynamically and emits photons , similar to we did previously@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , the elliptic flow of direct photons from averaged calculation ( dashed line ) is compared to event - by - event one ( solid line ) .",
    "the same maximum of elliptic flow are obtained , no matter event - by - event or averaged calculation .",
    "but the high order harmonics such as @xmath7 , @xmath67and @xmath68 vanish in the averaged calculation because of mixing the irregular events .",
    "the event - by - event curve moves leftward to reach the averaged curve .",
    "further movement is needed to reach the data shape .",
    "as we know viscosity plays a more important role for irregular systems , we may attribute the deviation from data shape to the lack of viscosity in the ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "a correct choice of @xmath23 is also important to get the large elliptic flow .",
    "fm / c is provided directly above .",
    "various @xmath23 should be checked , but not available if we requires a good reproduction of hadronic data .",
    "one available case is @xmath70  fm / c , as our previous work@xcite for au+au collisions at @xmath69  gev .",
    "this is a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics@xcite with glauber initial condition .",
    "averaged epos initial condition with @xmath70  fm / c provides the same elliptic flow at midrapidity@xcite , but a different rapidity dependence .",
    "so the following midrapidity discussion is general , valid for both of the two models .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , the transverse momentum spectrum and elliptic flow @xmath1 of direct photons from au+au collisions at @xmath69  gev for centrality 0 - 20% and 20 - 40% , calculated with @xmath71 1.1 , 1.6 , 2.1 and 2.6  fm / c are compared with phenix data points from phenix @xcite@xcite . the previous result with hadronic form factors@xcite ( dashed lines ) are very close to those calculated without form factors ( solid lines ) , because the spectrum at high @xmath13 is dominant by prompt photons , while at low @xmath13 , form factors are close to unity .",
    "the solid curves are overlapped in the upper panels , which shows the insensitivity of spectrum to @xmath8 . in the lower panels ,",
    "the solid curves from down to up are calculated with @xmath71 1.1 , 1.6 , 2.1 and 2.6  fm / c , respectively .",
    "the elliptic flow first increases with @xmath8 , then saturates . at @xmath72",
    "gev / c , the maximum of elliptic flow is only 60% of the measured value , for both centralities .",
    "thus , @xmath70  fm / c can not work .",
    "the large elliptic flow and the transverse spectrum of direct photons from pb+pb collisions at @xmath60  tev were explained with @xmath73  fm / c and @xmath74  fm / c .",
    "high order harmonics coefficient such as @xmath7 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 of direct photons were predicted , which behave also quite similar to those variables of charged hadrons .      with @xmath70",
    "fm / c , the large elliptic flow of direct photons from au+au collisions at @xmath69  gev can not be fully reproduced .",
    "the delayed qgp formation time can make the elliptic flow larger , but only up to 60% of the measured value .",
    "more work should be done systematically to extract @xmath23 and @xmath8 , with systems such as aa , pa and pp .",
    "a full explanation of the data of both charged hadrons and direct photons at both colliders are expected .",
