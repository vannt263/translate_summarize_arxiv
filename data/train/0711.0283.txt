    "primary cultures of cardiac muscle cells have been successfully utilized as experimental models to study the complex electrical and mechanical activity of the heart .",
    "this is because , compared to experiments using an intact heart , a variety of methods can be employed with relative ease to visualize and modify the dynamical activity of cells . taken together , these advantages enabled us to explore the nature of the complex dynamics that arise in cell cultures @xcite .",
    "previous studies revealed that the spatio - temporal patterns in the cellular activity of rhythmic contraction in cardiac muscle cell cultures undergo qualitative changes depending on the age of the culture .",
    "_ investigated the spontaneous contraction of a monolayer of cardiac cell culture for over one week , and found that various interesting temporal patterns , including subharmonic and alternant rhythms , arise spontaneously @xcite .",
    "spontaneous emergence and annihilation of spiral waves were also observed in several studies @xcite .",
    "kawahara and coworkers reported that formation of cellular network decreases the fluctuations in the timings of contraction @xcite .",
    "one possible reason for this phenomenon is an alternation in the degree of gap junction formation which brings a passive conductance between cells @xcite .",
    "interestingly , despite having been implicated in affecting the characteristics of intercellular communication , relatively little attention has been directed at the evolution of the spatial arrangement between cells .",
    "this may be due to the current belief that cardiac muscle cells , because they differ from self - propelling cells , including fibroblasts , do not possess the molecular apparatus necessary for facilitating active migration .",
    "however , even if a single cardiac muscle cell is unable to migrate by itself , it may be possible for the geometrical arrangement of the cells in a population to change via interactions among the cells .    to more accurately assess such a possibility , we investigated the evolution of the spatial arrangement of cells in a cardiac cell culture over an extended timescale in the present study .",
    "we found that cardiac muscle cells spontaneously aggregated and formed clusters in which cells constituting the same cluster periodically contracted in synchrony .",
    "the application of an agent that inhibits the contraction of cells results in the suppression of cluster formation , suggesting that the periodic contraction of individual cardiac muscle cells affects cluster formation .",
    "furthermore , the degree of cluster formation depends on the concentration of extra cellular matrix to which the cells adhere .",
    "these experimental findings indicate that the tension generated by periodic contraction of cardiac muscle cells contributes markedly to the driving force underlying cluster formation .",
    "the results of the present study suggest that the rhythmic contraction of cardiac muscle cells affects the spatial arrangement and structure of the cellular network .",
    "this phenomenon is likely to be concerned with age - dependent changes in the spatio - temporal dynamics of the electric activity of cells observed in earlier studies .",
    "this new hypothesis , contraction - induced modulation of an intercellular network , might provide a new class of dynamical phenomena in a cardiac tissue culture .",
    "primary cultures of ventricular cells were prepared from one - day - old newborn rats according to methods described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , ventricles isolated from the hearts of one - day - old newborn rats were minced and were treated with collagenase .",
    "isolated cells were collected by centrifugation and were supplied with plating medium ( dulbecco - modified eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum , 1% penicillin / streptomycin and 0.1 mm 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine ( brdu ) ) . in order to reduce the population of non - muscle cells , the method of selective plating",
    "was employed @xcite .",
    "then , the cells were counted and diluted to desired densities ( from @xmath0 cells / ml to @xmath1 cells / ml ) . because accurate estimation of the density of cells at this stage is technically difficult , not the absolute values but the relative values of initial cell density given in the following sections have a meaning .",
    "the cells were plated on the collagen - coated petri dishes ( see below ) , which was followed by incubation for 24 h. subsequently , the medium was exchanged with contraction medium ( modified eagle medium with 10% calf serum , 1% penicillin / streptomycin , and 0.1 mm brdu ) , and the cells were incubated under the same conditions as described above .",
    "polystyrene petri dishes ( bd biosciences , ca ) coated with collagen were used for experiments . in experiments described in sections  [ ss.clustering ] to [ ss.contraction ] , dishes were coated with collagen by incubating them with collagen ( type i , derived from rat tail , wako , osaka ) solubilized in acetic acid ( 0.1 % , ph 3 ) for several minutes at room temperature . in experiments described in section  [ ss.substratum ] ,",
    "the amount of collagen used to coat dishes was controlled as follows : first , varying concentrations of collagen solutions ( 1.2 mg/@xmath2 to 120 mg/@xmath2 ) diluted in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) were applied on petri dishes , which were then incubated at 4@xmath3c for 7 h. dishes were washed with pbs several times before use .      in order to observe the process of cluster formation ,",

    ", a culture dish was positioned on an on - stage incubation chamber ( in-0ni - f2 , tokai hit , shizuoka ) and examined under an inverted microscope ( ix-70 , olympus , tokyo ) .",
    "the culture was maintained under humidified conditions at 37@xmath3c and 5% co@xmath4 .",
    "the cell culture was observed using a 10@xmath5 objective lens under bright - field illumination and images were captured every 3 min for up to a week , using a digital charge - coupled - device ( ccd ) camera ( c4742 - 95 - 12sc , hamamatsu photonics , shizuoka ) .",
    "the culture medium was not exchanged during the time - lapse observations .",
    "the spatial distribution of the beat rate of cardiac muscle cells was studied as follows .",
    "culture dishes were incubated at the same condition as described above .",
    "spontaneous contraction of cardiac muscle cells were observed every 24 h using inverted phase - contrast microscope ( 4@xmath5 magnification ) and recorded at 30 frames per seconds for 3 minutes under the room temperature ( 25 @xmath3c ) .",
    "the sequential images ( 960 @xmath6m@xmath5 960 @xmath6 m ) were subdivided into small segments of 40@xmath6m@xmath5 40 @xmath6 m ( the size roughly corresponding one or two cells ) , for each of which average gray value was calculated to yield a set of time series . in these time series ,",
    "clear peaks associated with spontaneous contractions of cells in each segment occur @xcite .",
    "thus , the number of peaks in one minute was counted in order to calculate the beat rate of cells in each segment .",
    "the orientational order of cells was investigated , following the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , using bright - field time - lapse images .",
    "first , an image was subdivided into segments of 15 @xmath6m@xmath5 15 @xmath6 m , and a fourier power spectrum was calculated for each segment .",
    "the cross - correlation matrix of each fourier spectrum was calculated , and the principal axes were determined .",
    "it has been known that the principal axis with the smaller eigenvalue represents the mean direction of cellular arrangement @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two eigenvalues can be interpreted as the degree of orientational order , because it increases as the anisotropy of the original image increases .",
    "cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody , 5c5 , directed against @xmath7-sarcomeric actin ( a2172 , sigma , tokyo ) .",
    "furthermore , vectashield ( vector laboratories , u.  k. ) was used to overlay the cultures to prevent the sample from drying out .",
    "vectashield also contains 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole ( dapi ) which stains the nuclei of the cells .",
    "the stained cells were observed with an epifluorescent inverted microscope ( ix-70 , olympus , tokyo ) , and images were captured using a digital ccd camera ( dv887ecs - uvb , andor technology , northern ireland ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of cell nuclei was analyzed to assess the spatial distribution of cells .",
    "first , the distribution of the cellular clusters were determined as follows . at the seventh day from the onset of incubation ,",
    "the cells in culture were fixed using cold methanol ( -20 @xmath3c ) .",
    "the phase - contrast images of the culture were obtained for 16 @xmath5 16 fields of view , each of which has the size of 880 @xmath6m@xmath5 704 @xmath6 m and is 1 mm apart from its neighbors , using a motorized mechanical stage ( bios-105 t , sigma koki , tokyo ) .",
    "the number of clusters was counted manually from these images .",
    "second , the distribution of the cells was determined at a higher resolution as follows .",
    "the fluorescent images of cell nuclei stained with dapi were obtained for at least 79 fields of view ( 820 @xmath6 m @xmath5 820 @xmath6 m each ) for every culture dish .",
    "at least 9700 nuclei are included in the analysis for each sample .",
    "no significant difference among the samples in the same condition was observed in the essential trends in the results of following analysis .",
    "the images were processed and analyzed with image processing software imagej ( a public domain software originally developed at the us national institute of health ) .",
    "the images were converted to binary images by adopting a manually determined threshold of gray value . because there is a tendency that the images of neighboring cell nuclei become indistinguishable in the region with high cellular density , i.e. , in clusters ,",
    "the watershed algorithm was applied in order to separate them @xcite , although the separation was not complete .",
    "this leads to underestimation of the cellular density in the vicinity of clusters .    on the basis of the coordinates of the identified nuclei ,",

    "then , the number of cells constituting the same cluster was calculated for all the fields of view .      in order to characterize cellular contraction , motion analysis of fluorescent microbeads attached to the surface of the cells",

    "consequently , individual cells are likely to being in contact with several neighboring cells .",
    "once two cardiac muscle cells establish contact , gap junctions are formed @xcite , and their contractions become synchronized ( see fig .",
    "[ f.dynamics ] ) .",
    "these cells are also mechanically coupled via intercellular contact , including adherence junctions and desmosomes @xcite .",
    "contraction of a cell is attributed to muscle fibrils , which are complexes of cytoskeletons .",
    "the contraction of the muscle fibrils exerts tension on cytoskeletons , including actin filaments , which are anchored to the substratum via molecular apparatuses termed focal contact ( see fig .",
    "[ f.scheme]a ) . owing to this tension",
    ", focal contacts at the periphery of cells are pulled into the center of each cell ( this process may involve rapid destructions and reconstructions of focal contacts ) . through this process , cytoskeletons are rearranged and become compact .",
    "intercellular contacts are also expected to play an important role in maintaining and stabilizing the mechanical contacts between cells , against the contractile tension of cytoskeletons @xcite .",
    "if these intercellular connections are sufficiently tight , the center of each cell become closer to each other because each cell becomes compact ( see fig .",
    "[ f.scheme]b ) . since",
    "a number of cells are mechanically connected to each other and each cell becomes compact , the population of cells becomes denser and forms a cluster .",
    "if the force generated by contraction is too weak to move focal contacts , contraction of cells will not result in the cells moving closer .",
    "similarly , if the concentration of collagen is large , the number and the strength of focal contacts between the cytoskeleton and collagen would increase , making rearrangement of the cytoskeleton less likely and leading to the suppression of cluster formation .",
    "furthermore , as the density of cells increases , the number of cells that are initially in contact increases , resulting in the larger size of clusters .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the experimental results on the effects of bdm and also of the collagen concentration .    with regard to the cluster formation in cardiac cell culture ,",
    "it has been reported previously that the presence of fibroblasts is important for inducing the aggregation of cardiac muscle cells in some situations @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "given the difficulties associated with complete removal of proliferating non - muscle cells from cultures , it is not clear whether the presence of non - muscle cells , whose fraction was not large in the present study ( around 20 % even in the late stage of culture ) , is essential for the observed phenomena .",
    "however , as discussed above , several observations in the present study suggest that formation of clusters is also mediated by the interactions among cardiac muscle cells .",
    "finally , let us discuss the relation of the present results to the previous studies on the wave dynamics on the cardiac tissue culture .",
    "the formation of cellular clusters causes the cell preparations to become inhomogeneous and this may alter the dynamics of excitation waves @xcite . in particular , steinberg _ et al .",
    "_ reported that the propagation of excitation waves in a cardiac cell culture is affected by the concentration of collagen used to coat the substratum @xcite . since we have observed that the formation of clusters is also affected by the concentration of collagen on the substratum , it is possible that the alternation of wave dynamics observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is directly related to cluster formation .",
    "furthermore , while it has been demonstrated previously that the dynamics of excitation waves vary in a complicated manner over the time scale of several days @xcite , the results presented here demonstrate that that formation of clusters is one of the essential factor to cause these differences in observed wave dynamics .",
    "in the present paper , the mechanism of spontaneous cluster formation in a primary culture of ventricular cells from neonatal rats was investigated . on the basis of several observations",
    ", it is suggested that periodic contraction of cardiac muscle cells results in the relocation of focal contacts , and that this causes cells to aggregate . in other words ,",
    "the evolution of a cellular network is directly affected by the contraction activity of individual cells .",
    "the mechanism described here is still hypothetical , and further elucidation is necessary . by visualizing cytoskeletons and focal contacts in living cells using fluorescent proteins , more detailed information on the molecular processes taking place during cluster formation would be obtained .",
    "construction of theoretical models would also facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved .",
    "in addition to the molecular mechanism underlying cluster formation , it would be interesting to investigate how the formation of cluster structure affects the contraction dynamics of cells .",
    "moreover , the effect of spontaneous cell contraction on cellular properties , such as shape and the orientation of cells should also be investigated .    in previous studies ,",
    "the contraction dynamics of cardiac cell cultures have been theoretically studied within the framework of conventional reaction - diffusion systems or coupled oscillators @xcite , with age - dependent changes in the cellular network considered as merely changes in external parameters .",
    "the present study , however , suggests that the changes in these parameters may in fact be induced by the dynamics of the contraction itself",
    ". it might therefore be possible that a new class of phenomena arises through interactions between the dynamics of contraction and the structure of the cellular network .",
    "this research may therefore lead to the development of new strategies for controlling the architecture of cellular networks by modulating the contraction activity of cells .",
