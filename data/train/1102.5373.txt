    "recent observation of a large magnetoresistance in an antiferromagnet ( afm ) based spin - valve opens the prospect for utilizing afms in spintronics.@xcite particularly appealing is the introduction of afms into semiconductor spintronics because of the lack of suitable high - temperature ferromagnetic ( fm ) semiconductors . in tab  [ tab1 ]",
    "we show a survey of the magnetic counterparts of the most common ii - vi and iii - v compound semiconductors , and of the related i - vi - iii - vi and ii - v - iv - v families , in which mn ( eu ) acts as a group - ii atom and fe ( gd ) as a group - iii element .",
    "the table illustrates that afm ordering occurs much more frequently than fm ordering .",
    "yet , only a few of these afm semiconductors have nel temperatures @xmath0 above the room temperature . in mnte ,",
    "@xmath1  k is presumably still too low to allow for room - temperature applications of the material in spintronics .",
    "mnsin@xmath2 appears as an attractive candidate material which should also allow for the application of common molecular beam epitaxy techniques for the synthesis of high quality films .",
    "the natural mineral cufes@xmath2 is more challenging from the perspective of the epitaxial growth because of the vastly different vapor pressures of s and the noble and transition metals .",
    "another limiting factor is that both mnsin@xmath2 and cufes@xmath2 might be the only high-@xmath0 afms in their respective semiconductor compound families .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    the search for other high temperature afm semiconductors has recently resulted in a report of the semiconducting band structure of i(a)-mn - v compounds and of the successful synthesis of single - crystal limnas by molecular beam epitaxy.@xcite in contrast to the other common semiconductor compound families , many of the i(a)-mn - v semiconductors are room - temperature afms.@xcite while favorable from the perspective of their electronic band structure and magnetic characteristics , the utility of i(a)-mn - v materials in devices may represent a challenge due to the high reactivity and diffusivity of the i(a ) alkali metals elements .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the noble - metal group - i(b ) counterparts of these compounds . in particular , we focus on cumnas and cumnp .",
    "the anticipation of semiconducting band structure of the high - temperature afm limnas ( and other i(a)-mn - v s ) was based on the picture of li@xmath4 charge state as in zintl compounds , mn@xmath5 charge state as observed in ( ga , mn)as and some other ( iii , mn)v and ( ii , mn)vi magnetic semiconductors , and the established close relationship between non - magnetic i(a)-ii - v and iii - v semiconductors.@xcite from this viewpoint , the cu@xmath4mn@xmath5sb@xmath6 configuration inferred from previous density functional theory studies@xcite of this semi - heusler alloy hints that the replacement of the i(a ) alkali - metal with the i(b ) cu in i - mn - v compounds is a promising approach .",
    "although not a semiconductor , cumnsb is also not a conventional metal with a high density of states at the fermi energy but rather a semimetal with a small overlap between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band.@xcite the relatively low room - temperature conductivity of @xmath7  @xmath8@xmath9 measured in this compound supports the theoretically predicted semimetal band - structure.@xcite by introducing a lighter group - v element as or p , one may expect the band - gap to fully open .    in the literature",
    ", cumnsb is often quoted as a rare example among semi - heusler alloys with afm order.@xcite it has a nel temperature of 50  k. synthesis and crystal structure measurements of cumnas and cumnp were reported in ref .  .",
    "unlike the cubic cumnsb , the equilibrium crystal structure of cumnas and cumnp is orthorhombic pnma . susceptibility measurements of cumnas presented in ref .",
    "indicate possible afm order at room temperature . to the best of our knowledge , the electronic and magnetic structure of cumnas and",
    "cumnp has not been further investigated experimentally and no band structure calculations have been published to date . in this paper",
    "we present full - potential density functional theory calculations of the electronic and magnetic structure of cumnas and cumnp .",
    "we complement the theory analysis by x - ray diffraction , magnetization , transport , and neutron diffraction measurements of chemically synthesized cumnas . as a reference",
    ", we also report our experimental results on cumnsb .",
    "to calculate the electronic structure of cumn - v compounds we employed the full - potential linearized - augmented - plane - wave method ( wien2k package).@xcite using the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite we first compare energies of the fm and afm states of the equilibrium orthorhombic crystal structure and the metastable cubic semi - heusler structure of cumnas and cumnp . in the former case we use experimental lattice parameters@xcite",
    "@xmath10   , @xmath11   , and @xmath12   for cumnas and @xmath13   , @xmath14   , and @xmath15   for cumnp . by minimizing the total energy of the cubic phase we determined the corresponding theoretical lattice constant @xmath16   for cumnas and @xmath17   for cumnp .",
    "the calculated difference between the fm and afm total energy in the cubic crystal phase is @xmath18  mev / mn - atom for cumnas and @xmath19  mev / mn - atom for cumnp .",
    "here we considered the same afm alignment of mn moments in cumnas and cumnp as reported in the neutron diffraction study of cumnsb.@xcite a comparison with theoretical results for cumnsb , where @xmath20  mev / mn - atom,@xcite suggests that @xmath0 increases when replacing sb with as or p due to a tighter lattice arrangement .",
    "however , the expected increase of @xmath0 is only in the range of @xmath2120% for the cubic phase .    for the orthorhombic structure we considered the fm and three different afm moment configurations , as shown in fig .  1",
    "mn atoms in these orthorhombic crystals are arranged in layers parallel to the @xmath22 plane and the different afm arrangements can then be characterized by afm in - plane arrangement and fm coupling between the planes ( afm@xmath23-fm@xmath24 , pn@xmath25m@xmath25a , fig  1(b ) ) , fm in - plane arrangement and afm coupling between the planes ( fm@xmath23-afm@xmath24 , pn@xmath25m@xmath25a@xmath25 , fig  1(c ) ) , or afm in - plane arrangement and afm coupling between the planes ( afm@xmath23-afm@xmath24 , pnm@xmath25a , fig  1(d ) ) . in cumnas ,",
    "the gga total energies of the fm@xmath23-afm@xmath24 and afm@xmath23-afm@xmath24 states are very similar ( the difference is 1  mev / mn - atom ) while the energy of the afm@xmath23-fm@xmath24 state is significantly higher ( by 80  mev / mn - atom ) . in cumnp",
    ", the afm@xmath23-fm@xmath24 state has again the highest energy and the difference between the gga energy of the states fm@xmath23-afm@xmath24 and afm@xmath23-afm@xmath24 is 30  mev / mn - atom with the latter afm state having the lowest energy . when comparing total energies of the fm and afm states we took the afm@xmath23-afm@xmath24 state , i.e. compared energies of the spin configurations in fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(d ) , and obtained @xmath26  mev / mn - atom for cumnas and @xmath27  mev / mn - atom for cumnp .",
    "these values are significantly larger than in the cubic crystals and the theory , therefore , predicts that the orthorhombic cumnas and cumnp have significantly higher nel temperature than the semi - heusler cumnsb .",
    "the stability of the orthorhombic crystal phase of cumnas and cumnp and the possibility for these compounds to form thin epitaxial films with the metastable cubic phase can be estimated from the difference in total energies of the two crystal structures .",
    "for cumnas we obtained @xmath28  ev / mn - atom and for cumnp the difference is @xmath29  ev / mn - atom . for comparison , the total energy of the cubic phase of , e.g. ,",
    "gan is larger than the energy of the equilibrium hexagonal phase by 0.02  ev / atom and in this case both crystal structures can be realized in thin films .",
    "for mnas on the other hand , the difference between the cubic and hexagonal phases is 1  ev / mn - atom and the cubic phase has been stabilized only in the form of nanocrystal inclusions in a cubic matrix . from these comparisons",
    "we conclude that the orthorhombic phases of cumnas and cumnp are very stable and the occurrence of the metastable cubic phases in bulk or thin film materials is unlikely",
    ".    examples of the calculated band dispersions are shown in figs .",
    "[ cumnsb_cubic]-[ldagga ] . in figs .",
    "[ cumnsb_cubic ] and [ cumnp_cubic ] we compare band structures of the cubic cumnsb and cumnp calculated in the gga+u approximations with typical values of the correlation parameters@xcite for mn @xmath30-orbitals , @xmath31  ev and @xmath32  ev . as already pointed out in ref .  , cumnsb is a semimetal with a negative indirect band - gap .",
    "[ cumnp_cubic ] shows that cumnp , on the other hand , is already a semiconductor with a fully developed positive band - gap throughout the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the semiconducting band structure of cumnp is obtained also in the gga+u calculation of the orthorhombic phase as shown in fig .",
    "[ cumnp_ortho ] .",
    "cumnas has a small but non - zero density of states at the fermi energy in the gga+u spectra as shown in fig .",
    "[ cumnas_ortho ] .",
    "since density functional theory tends to underestimate band gaps in semiconductors we conclude that the electronic structure of cumnas is in the transition region between a semimetal and a semiconductor . for completeness",

    "[ ldagga ] band structures of orthorhombic cumnas and cumnp calculated in the local density approximation ( lda),@xcite lda+u , gga , and gga+u . in the plots we focus on the part of the spectra in which the gap opens in cumnp .",
    "the spectra are consistent with common trends in iii - v semiconductors of larger band gaps for lighter group - v elements and with the expected enhancement of the calculated semiconductor gap due to both the gga correction to the local density theory and the correlation effects on mn @xmath30-orbitals",
    ". since the effects of these corrections are relatively strong , it might be desirable to employ in future studies computational methods which go beyond the gga+u approximation in order to get a more quantitative understanding of the electronic structure of cumn - v compounds .",
    "in this section we discuss experimental properties of cumnas .",
    "samples were prepared by direct synthesis from elements mixed in the stoichiometric 1:1:1 ratio using cu ( purity 99.999 % ) , mn ( purity 99.98 % ) , and as ( purity 99.999 % ) .",
    "they were placed into al@xmath2o@xmath33 crucible and double sealed inside quartz ampoules .",
    "samples were heated up to 1000@xmath34c at a rate of 1@xmath34c / min and annealed for 1 day .",
    "the reaction produced silver - gray solid rocks .",
    "powder samples and polished - layer samples were prepared from the material for x - ray diffraction measurements , chemical analysis , magnetization measurements by the superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , van der pauw transport measurements , and neutron diffraction measurements . for comparison",
    "we also prepared cumnsb samples using the same procedures .    in fig .",

    "diffraction patterns were obtained using a bruker d8 advance diffractometer in the bragg - brentano geometry and copper k@xmath35 radiation .",
    "data analysis was carried out using the fullprof package.@xcite the measurements show that cumnas has the orthorhombic pnma crystal structure consistent with x - ray data in ref .   and cumnsb has the cubic semi - heusler structure as reported previously.@xcite note that x - ray measurements of cumnas performed in the 300  k - 600  k range did not reveal any structural phase transition .",
    "elemental analysis by energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) confirmed the stoichiometric 1:1:1 ratio of cu , mn , and as(sb ) in the studied materials within the experimental error of @xmath211% .    in fig .",

    "[ squidcumnas ] .",
    "we observe that the magnetic susceptibility of cumnas increases with increasing temperature up to much higher temperatures than in cumnsb , in agreement with measurements presented in ref .  .",
    "the dependence reverses above @xmath21450  k , indicating that @xmath0 is above room temperature . as in the afm cumnsb",
    "we observe zero remanence below @xmath0 in cumnas ( see inset in fig .  [ squidcumnas ] ) .",
    "the transition to a magnetically ordered state in cumnas is observed also in transport data shown in fig .",
    "[ squidcumnas ] . above 400",
    "k the material has a metallic conductance which increases with decreasing temperature . near 400  k the conductance drops abruptly before it resumes the metallic character below 350  k. such a conductance drop is commonly observed in magnetic materials and associated with critical scattering near the transition temperature .",
    "we also point out that the conductivity at 300  k of cumnas is 800  @xmath8@xmath9 which is almost an order of magnitude lower than the room - temperature conductivity of the semimetal cumnsb .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretically predicted trend towards semiconducting character of cumn - v compounds with lighter group - v elements .",
    "we conclude the experimental section by presenting initial results of room - temperature neutron diffraction measurements .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ neutron ] were taken on the instrument meredit in the nuclear physics institute in rez , czech republic .",

    "the best fit using fullprof package@xcite to the data was obtained for the afm@xmath23-afm@xmath24 mn moment configuration ( fig  1(d ) ) .",
    "in summary , we have performed a combined theoretical and experimental study of electronic and magnetic properties of cumn - v compounds which complements previous work on alkali - metal based i(a)-mn - v afm semiconductors .",
    "the transition from a low nel temperature afm cumnsb to room - temperature afms cumnas and cumnp is ascribed to the orthorhombic crystal structure of the latter two compounds .",
    "the transition from a semimetal cumnsb to a semiconductor cumnp is reminiscent of the trend of increasing band gap in iii - v semiconductor compounds with lighter group - v elements .",
