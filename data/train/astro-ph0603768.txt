    "the two main hypotheses to explain the high luminosity of ulxs are intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) having @xmath3 to @xmath4 solar masses ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) or non - isotropic emission beamed into our line - of - sight ( king et al . 2001 ) . + here",
    ", we are interested in one of these object , holmberg ix x-1 , located at a distance of 3.6 mpc in a dwarf galaxy companion of m81 . miller ( 1995 )",
    "discovered the nebula around the position of the x - ray source and proposed that this object was an extremely luminous supernova remnant , but the presence of x - ray variability ( la parola et al . 2001 ) has shown that it is a compact x - ray source . +",
    "our optical observations were carried out in 2003 and 2004 with the 8.2 meter subaru telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in the huge supernova remnant - like complex , our images reveal that a `` blue non - stellar object '' seen in previous studies is in fact a star cluster where the brightest members are resolved ( figure [ figures]).the most luminous object is a 22.8 mag object , located in the 1 \" radius chandra error circle ; we note that in archive hst images this object has a fainter ( by 1.9 mag ) companion to the west .",
    "one very interesting result is the discovery of the heii@xmath24686 emission in the brightest star ( i.e. not in the fainter companion ) with an equivalent width ( ew ) of some ( figure [ figures ] ) , proving that it is the optical counterpart of the x - ray source .",
    "this is a common feature in luminous massive x - ray binaries , but here with an ew ten to twenty times higher .",
    "this strongly suggests the presence of an accretion disk that is heated by the very luminous x - ray source .",
    "this constitutes further evidence against beaming in ulx and opens the possibility to measure the binary orbit from radial velocity observations .",
    "+ isochrone fitting to our multi - colour photometry has permitted to constrain the age of the star cluster to which the ulx belongs to about 20 to 50 myr , and to put an upper limit on the total cluster mass - some 10@xmath5 m@xmath6 .",
    "this directly implies that the donor component in the ulx can not be more massive than 8 m@xmath6 , because more massive cluster stars have already exploded as supernovae .",
    "optical observations of radial velocity variations of the heii@xmath24686 line in ulxs will hopefully allow to determine the masses of the components in these systems .",
    "this would be a decisive test on whether imbh are present in ulxs or not .",
    "optical observations of other ulx ( in particular ngc 1313 x-2 ) show strikingly similar characteristics ( see contribution at this symposium by pakull et al . ) .",
    "+ future optical observations will be crucial to reveal nature and evolution of the exciting class of ultraluminous x - ray emitters ."
