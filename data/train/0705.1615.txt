    "while cosmology is entering its precision era , the target of experiments aimed at the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is shifting towards weak signals , e.g.  polarization , the sz effect and non gaussian ( ng ) features .",
    "detection of ng signals can be of significant help in constraining the mechanisms that explain the generation of cosmological perturbations .",
    "provided that systematic effects will not degrade high sensitivity cmb mapping , present and future experiments could in principle be sensitive to non linearities due to second order effects in perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "this signal is usually parametrized by a non linear coupling factor @xmath0 that controls the level of a quadratic contribution to the primordial gravitational potential @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath6\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a zero mean , gaussian random field .",
    "several groups have reported ng constraints on cmb data .",
    "all suborbital efforts to date have found no significant deviation from gaussianity in the cmb field : maxima-1 reported @xmath8 at @xmath9  @xcite , while vsa found an upper limit of 5400 at @xmath10 @xcite ; archeops has recently improved their limits to @xmath11 ( @xmath10 ) , although their analysis is based on assumptions only valid for the large angular scales dominated by the sachs - wolfe effect  @xcite .",
    "the boomerang 1998 dataset has also been tested for gaussianity , both in pixel @xcite and in fourier @xcite space , finding no trace of ng signals .",
    "however , boomerang has set no @xmath0 limit so far .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to provide such limits with the analysis of the new 2003 data .",
    "the limits presented here are more stringent than those found by any suborbital experiment to date , properly accounting for sub - horizon angular scales .",
    "the wmap team constrained @xmath0 to be @xmath12 @xcite . using an improved version of the wmap team estimator creminelli et al .",
    "( 2007 ) set the most stringent limits to date at @xmath13 .",
    "thus the @xmath0 analysis does not show any departure from gaussianity in wmap data . however , some authors have looked at general deviations from gaussianity ( i.e. not based on any specific parametrization of ng ) and claimed highly - significant detection of ng features in the wmap maps @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform a pixel space analysis of the b03 temperature ( t ) data set , using the observed field s moments and minkowski functionals ( mfs ) to build gaussianity tests .",
    "we assess the statistical significance of our results comparing the data to a set of highly realistic , gaussian monte carlo ( mc ) simulated maps . in order to constrain @xmath0",
    ", we build a goodness of fit statistics based on mfs and calibrated against a set of ng cmb maps , that are generated according to the algorithm set forth in @xcite .",
    "the plan of this letter is as follows : in section  [ sec1 ] we briefly describe the b03 experiment , the dataset it has produced and our simulation pipeline . in section  [ sec2 ] we compute the map s moments and mfs of the data and compare results against gaussian mc simulated maps .",
    "then we derive constraints for @xmath0 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec4 ] we draw our main conclusions .",
    "the balloon borne b03 experiment has been flown from antarctica in 2003 .",
    "it gathered data for 14 days in three frequency bands , centered at 145 , 245 and 345 ghz . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the 145 ghz data that are most sensitive to cmb fluctuations .",
    "these have been obtained with polarization sensitive bolometers ( psb ) .",
    "the analysis of the dataset has produced high quality maps of the southern sky that have been conveniently divided in three regions : a `` deep '' ( in terms of integration time ) survey region ( @xmath14 square degrees ) and a `` shallow '' survey region ( @xmath15 square degrees ) , both at high galactic latitudes , as well as a region of @xmath16 square degrees across the galactic plane .",
    "the deep region is completely embedded in the shallow region .",
    "here we only consider a subset of the data that contains all of the deep region and part of the shallow , for a total of 693 square degrees ( 1.7% of the sky ) .",
    "the mask we use is square , 26 degrees in side , centered at about ra=@xmath17 and dec=@xmath18 , and excludes all detected point sources in the field .",
    "this region has been selected in view of high sensitivity cmb observation with low foreground contamination and was observed with a highly connected scanning strategy to keep systematics under control .",
    "we use the t data map reduced jointly from eight psb at 145 ghz  @xcite . in this region , the signal rms on @xmath19 pixels is @xmath20 and instrumental noise has an rms of @xmath21 in the deep region and of @xmath20 in the shallow region . in harmonic space , binned estimates of the cmb angular power spectrum retain signal to noise @xmath22 well beyond @xmath23 .",
    "one may compare these figures with wmap : in the three year release , wmap combined sensitivity in the region observed by b03 is @xmath24 on @xmath19 pixels , close to wmap s mean pixel error .",
    "however , wmap s beams are broader than b03 , so its @xmath25 space error is @xmath26 5 times larger than b03 at @xmath27 . on the other hand",
    ", b03 has not been devised to measure multipoles at @xmath28 . in this sense ,",
    "our ng analysis probes angular scales complementary to those constrained by wmap .",
    "while we do not consider here the stokes q and u polarization maps , our t map has been marginalized with respect to linear polarization . for a description of the instrument and",
    "the measured t and polarization maps see  @xcite and for the cmb tt , te and ee power spectra see  @xcite .    to assess the robustness of our tests of gaussianity we use a set of simulated mc maps that mimic the b03 data . to produce these",
    ", we follow the same steps performed when analysing real data .",
    "the gaussian cmb sky signal is simulated from the power spectra that best fits the b03 data @xcite .",
    "this signal is smoothed according to the measured beam and synthetized into a pixelized sky map , using healpix routines @xcite . using the b03 scanning strategy ,",
    "the signal map is projected onto 8 timestreams , one for each 145 ghz detector .",
    "noise only timestreams are also produced , as gaussian realizations of each detector s noise power spectral density , estimated from the data accounting for cross talks among detectors .",
    "the timelines are reduced with the roma mapmaking code  @xcite replicating the actual flight pointing and transient flagging , to produce t , q and u maps . with this procedure",
    ", we can simulate signal , noise and signal plus noise timestream . to constrain @xmath0 we use mc simulations of ng cmb maps obtained from a primordial gravitational potential of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fnl ] ) .",
    "these maps have been produced including first order cmb radiative transfer effects @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of the ng maps is identical to that of the gaussian cmb simulations .",

    "these are obtained from the variance @xmath34 and from the third and the fourth moment @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the total number of pixels of the map and @xmath38 its mean .",

    "it is important that the covariance matrix built for the joint estimator correctly accounts for correlations among different functionals .",
    "however , we have found that in order to pin down to a stable level these off - block couplings , one requires a number realizations significantly higher than the @xmath67 used throughout our analysis .",
    "the latter number can not be realistically increased to desired level , because the gls map making procedure is a demanding computational task , even for the supercomputers we have used .",
    "fortunately , we have found that using white ( instead of correlated ) noise to estimate the covariance matrix has a negligible impact on the analysis .",
    "this finding can indeed be justified a posteriori , because the gls map making procedure is very effective in suppressing noise correlations , that contribute very weakly to the estimator s final covariance .",
