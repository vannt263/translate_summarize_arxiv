    "the first @xmath0 state calculated in stddm is energetically shifted upward and becomes significantly more collective as compared with that in rpa .",
    "the increase in the excitation energy is due to the lowering of the ground state , and the enhancement of the collectivity of the first @xmath0 state is due to the mixing of two - body configurations induced by ground - state correlations .",
    "these properties of the first @xmath0 state under the influence of ground - state correlations are similar to those obtained from quasi - particle rpa calculations @xcite and also from the tddm calculation @xcite .",
    "large single - particle space including continuum states has been used in these realistic calculations @xcite so as to deal with giant resonances as well as low - lying states .",
    "therefore , only a semi - quantitative comparison between our previous tddm result @xcite and the present stddm calculation , which can only be performed in very truncated single - particle space , should be made for lowest - lying states . in srpa where ground - state correlations are neglected ,",
    "the 2@xmath90 states become also collective due to the coupling to two particle - two hole configurations , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "however , their excitation energies are simply shifted downward .",
    "this might cause serious problems when unperturbed particle - hole energies are small and ( or ) when the coupling to two - body configurations is strong .",
