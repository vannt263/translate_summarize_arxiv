    "the purpose of topological quantum computation ( tqc ) is to realize a reliable quantum computer , exploiting the existence of special quasiparticles , known as non - abelian anyons , in certain exotic condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "the presence of several such particles gives rise to degenerate ground states which can not be distinguished by local measurements .",
    "the ground state manifold is then adopted as the computational space , and quantum gates can be performed by braiding ( exchanging the positions of the anyons ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_layout]a ) . the resulting unitary transformation of the wave function depends only on the order of the exchanges and not on the details of their paths , thus these quantum gates are said to be topologically protected . in the standard scheme of tqc @xcite",
    ", there are two main ingredients needed to implement braiding .",
    "first , it must be possible to change the positions of anyons in such a way that the wave function of the system always belongs to the space of the degenerate ground states .",
    "second , at all stages of the braiding the interactions between the anyons used for the computation must be negligible in order to preserve the degeneracy of the ground states and to avoid the presence of non - adiabatic time - dependent phases .",
    "this requires the anyons to be well separated in space .",
    "the possibility to realize braiding operators without moving the anyons was then introduced by bonderson , freedman and nayak in refs .",

    "the measurement - only tqc , the braid operators are obtained as a result of a probabilistically determined sequence of non - demolition measurements of the computational anyons as shown in fig .  [ fig_layout]b ) .",
    "this measurement would rely , for example , on the non - abelian edge state interferometry @xcite , which has been actively developed both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "a different way to braid non - abelian anyons without moving them around each other has been theoretically developed in the case of majorana fermions appearing at the ends of one - dimensional topological superconductors @xcite .",
    "initially , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite how braids can be realized in wire networks by moving the majorana fermions through t - shaped junctions . in this case , the movement of the quasiparticles is restricted to a quasi one - dimensional system , thus relaxing the limitation of braiding to two dimensions .",
    "subsequent proposals however have eliminated the need to physically move the topological defects altogether , showing how the same ground state transformations can be implemented using the mutual interactions between majoranas , controlling either tunnel couplings via gate voltages @xcite or capacitive couplings via magnetic fluxes @xcite . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite a general theory of adiabatic manipulations of majorana fermions in nanowires was formulated . unless we allow for physically bending and rotating the wires , the minimal setup required for the braid operation is a t - shaped configuration of nanowires where a central majorana is coupled to at least three neighbors .",
    "the evolution over a path in parameter space results in the same non - abelian berry phase expected after an exchange of two quasiparticles in real space .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to show that in a broad range of anyonic models braiding is not only a property of the particle motion , but it is also encoded in the many - body hamiltonian of coupled anyons .",
    "we will show how it is possible to engineer effective braidings by manipulating mutual couplings between neighboring anyons , rather than their coordinates in space .",
    "the motion of anyons is unnecessary also in measurement - only tqc , however our proposal is different because the braid operation is performed in a deterministic manner and does not rely on the procedure of anyon measurement .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section [ sec_hamiltonian ]",
    "we present the minimal braiding setup , formed by four anyons in a t - shaped junction , and we give an expression of the interaction hamiltonian in terms of the @xmath0-matrices of a generic anyon model . in sec .",

    "[ sec_conclusions ] we discuss how errors affecting the adiabatic evolution can be reduced by embedding the braiding junction in a bigger system of anyon chains and conclude .",
    "we consider a system of four anyons with the same topological charge @xmath1 in a t - junction geometry , with a central anyon ( labeled @xmath2 ) coupled to other three ( labeled @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 for left , right and bottom ) , as shown in fig .",

    "we require that the interaction of each anyon with the central one favors an abelian channel @xmath17 , with a fusion energy @xmath18 .",

    "it has been shown that tunneling couplings between anyons lift completely the topological degeneracy of the ground state @xcite , and the hamiltonian makes no exception if all @xmath28 are non - zero .",
    "on the other hand , if all the couplings are zero , the ground state manifold coincides with the whole hilbert space of the anyon system .",
    "we focus here on the intermediate domain between these two extreme cases , namely when only a subspace of the full hilbert space has its degeneracy left intact .",
    "the hamiltonian has an @xmath8-fold degenerate ground state when at least one of the @xmath23 is zero and one is non - zero .",

    "the total topological charge equals @xmath35 .",
    "since @xmath34 is abelian , the fusion @xmath36 can only have one possible outcome , and additionally there can not be another charge @xmath37 such that @xmath38 has the same outcome .",
    "therefore there exists a one - to - one mapping between the charges @xmath32 and @xmath39 , implying that the ground state wave function @xmath40 will generically be a superposition of @xmath8 orthogonal ground states @xmath41 with total topological charge @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",

    "the overall degeneracy can not change , since @xmath46 , which again gives @xmath8 orthogonal states .",
    "we conclude that if all the couplings @xmath23 are neither _ on _ nor _ off _ at the same time , the ground state of the hamiltonian has an @xmath8-fold degeneracy .          in order to describe the wave function evolution in the @xmath8-fold",

    "we closely follow the methods used for the study of anyon chains and lattices ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the different quantum states of a system of anyons can be specified by the sequence of fusion outcomes along a certain fusion path .",
    "the choice of a fusion path is equivalent to the choice of a basis in the hilbert space .",
    "once a fusion path is chosen , the projector of two anyons on a given channel @xmath9 is represented by a simple diagonal matrix if the two anyons fuse directly together along the path with outcome @xmath9 .",

    "the latter is the total topological charge of the system : subspaces of the hilbert space corresponding to different @xmath39 are decoupled . adopting this basis we can now write down explicitly all the terms appearing in the hamiltonian . to this purpose",

    ", the interactions between @xmath19 and the other anyons may favor different abelian fusion channels @xmath20 if all the fusions @xmath144 assume the same topological charge .",
    "the main example is the case of ising anyons @xmath145 , which obey the fusion rules @xmath146 , @xmath147 , with both @xmath148 and @xmath149 abelian ; in this case changing the favored fusion channel of the pairwise interaction between @xmath26 ( or @xmath31 ) and @xmath19 determines a change in the chirality of the braiding @xcite .",
    "this is due to an additional symmetry of the ising anyon model : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the projector over the fermionic fusion channel @xmath149 .",
    "this relation implies that changing the favored fusion channel for one of the two anyons @xmath31 or @xmath26 , the role of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are exchanged throughout the adiabatic cycle and effectively reverses the braiding direction .",
