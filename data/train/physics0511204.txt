    "the von krmn flows generated in the gap between counter - rotating impellers has been considered by several groups as a possible candidate  @xcite in the search for a laboratory demonstration of a homogeneous fluid dynamo that would be less constrained than the riga and karlsruhe designs  @xcite . in these experiments , liquid sodium is often used because its electrical conductivity is high ( half that of copper , at @xmath0c ) , while its density remains low , of the order of that for water .",
    "its magnetic diffusivity , as for all metals , is many orders of magnitude larger than its hydrodynamic viscosity .",
    "the flow reynolds number needs to be very large in order for non - linearities to develop in the magnetic induction . as a consequence ,",
    "the hydrodynamic flow is very turbulent , and many questions arise concerning the influence of turbulence on the bifurcation threshold and the dynamics in an eventual saturated regime .",
    "this problem is very complex , and many studies so far have focused on the dynamo capacity of the average flow engineered in the von krmn ( vk ) geometry . here , ` average ' has the meaning of ` time - average ' .",
    "a time - averaged flow field @xmath1 is derived from measurements in water prototypes ( for convenience and because velocimetry methods are scarce in opaque , high temperature flows of liquid metals  @xcite ) as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a time much longer than the one characteristic of the forcing of the flow ( estimated , for instance , as the period of rotation of the driving impellers ) .",
    "this stationary flow profile  no longer a solution of the navier - stokes equation  is then usually inserted into a kinematic numerical solver , in which the induction equation @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the magnetic diffusivity ) is solved with the velocity field kept constant in time  @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown the possibility of dynamo action in the average vk flows , and the underlying induction processes have been measured in sodium and gallium flows  @xcite and analyzed in details  @xcite .",
    "it showed that the helicity and differential rotation present in the von krmn mean flow cooperate to generate a self - sustained dynamo .",
    "the existence of a kinematic dynamo threshold for the vk flows , together with the possibility to bring its value within experimental reach ( in terms of power requirements ) has motivated the sodium experiments in maryland , cadarache and wisconsin  ( @xcite and references therein ) . however , it has also been recognized early  @xcite that vk flows at high reynolds numbers have strong fluctuations . as a result",
    "the instantaneous mean flow structure can differ significantly from the time - averaged flow .",
    "this has motivated investigations regarding the influence of noise on the dynamo bifurcation .",
    "for instance , it has been proposed that the vk flow may lead to an intermittent dynamo  @xcite : burst of dynamo activity would occur , triggered by transient flow structures that are most efficient at generating magnetic induction .",
    "induction measurements in the presence of an externally applied field have been made in the vks experiment  @xcite .",
    "they have demonstrated the existence of fluctuations in the magnetic induction due to small scale turbulence and also generated from the instationarity of the large scales .",
    "for example , it has been observed that the local fluctuations of induction measured during a time interval @xmath6 increase logarithmically with @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "this finding can be linked to the existence of a @xmath7 scaling in the low frequency domain of the magnetic induction spectrum , a feature that has been also observed in numerical models  @xcite and in the dynamo regime of the karlsruhe experiment  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to explore further the above ideas .",
    "we relate the fluctuations in time of magnetic induction to large scale fluctuations in the geometry of vk flows .",
    "we use a vk flow of liquid gallium , and we study the magnetic induction in the presence of an externally applied field . besides being relatively easy to handle in the laboratory , the magnetic reynolds number in gallium flows reaches values of order 1 : induction effects are measurable and the non - linearities are not yet strong .",
    "the amplitude of the induced field is often an order of magnitude smaller than the amplitude of the applied field , and , in the quasi - static limit  @xcite , the induction equation ( [ eqb ] ) is reduced to @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the applied field .",
    "when it is uniform in space , the induced field solves @xmath10 so that it is directly related to the velocity gradients in the flow ( although the solution is not local ; the overall topology of the velocity gradients and the boundary conditions do enter in the solution of this poisson equation ) .",
    "the induction measurements are made using a new probe made of a line of magnetic field sensors .",
    "it samples simultaneously one component of the magnetic field at several location within the flow .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we describe the experimental set - up and we characterize our multi - probe magnetic measurements .",
    "the results are detailed in section iii and their implications regarding dynamo action in vk flows are discussed in section iv .",

    "the rotation is opposite in each half of the cylinder , leading to a strong differential rotation and the recirculation loops in the flow create a stagnation point : the poloidal flow converges in the mid - plane and is drawn towards the disks on either side .",

    "the profiles obtained numerically are shown as solid lines .",
    "one observes an excellent agreement with the experimental measurements .",
    "it indicates that the mean induction is very well accounted for by the time - averaged flow  equation  ( [ eqindsta ] ) .    using all combinations for the directions of",
    "the applied and measured induced magnetic fields , we have observed that the induction is dominated by two main mechanisms : the differential rotation generated by the counter rotating disks ( the toroidal part of the flow ) and the existence of a stagnation point in the mid plane ( the poloidal component ) . for an applied field parallel to the rotation @xmath62-axis ( case in fig .",
    "3 ) , the toroidal velocity gradients induce a toroidal magnetic field ( the omega effect ) and the poloidal velocity gradients generate a stretching of the applied field lines . when the field is applied transverse to the rotation axis ( e.g. along the @xmath63-axis ) the poloidal flow produce a compression of the applied field lines while the toroidal flow generates a @xmath62-component associated to the connection of the magnetic field lines induced along the @xmath64-axis on each side of the mid plane .",
    "this effect is quite sensitive to the electromagnetic boundary conditions ; we have called it the bc - effect  @xcite .",
    "regarding the mean ( time - averaged ) value of the magnetic induction , our main finding is that the average induction coincides with the induction predicted from the average flow  at least for the magnetic reynolds numbers reached in this gallium experiment .",

    "i.e. _ , the mean induced field effectively solves @xmath66 . we will report elsewhere a detailed analysis of the induction effects due to the turbulent small scale fluctuations  @xcite ; its main finding is to confirm the above statement :",
    "the small scale turbulent fluctuations do not contribute to the mean induction .        as pointed out in the introduction , due to the very small value of the prandtl number ,",
    "the flow is fully turbulent .",
    "the reynolds number is larger than @xmath25 , even for the relatively moderate values of the magnetic reynolds number reached here .",
    "the local velocity fluctuations reach 35% of the mean speed , and so do the induced fields , as shown in figure 4(a , b ) .",
    "the fluctuations are large and occur over a very broad range of time scales .",

    "this is due to the fact that in our experiment @xmath22 is of order one , so that the magnetic dissipation scale @xmath69 is of the order of the flow size .",
    "our measurements  figure 4(c )  show a steeper slope , of the order of @xmath70 for driving disks fitted with blades .",
    "the kolmogorov prediction @xmath71 was observed in the flow generated by flat rugose disks  @xcite .",
    "the slope of the spectra in the high - frequency ( dissipative ) region does not depend upon which component is being probed , nor on the rotation rate of the disks .",
    "another observation is that the magnetic induction also fluctuates in a broad range of long time scales , as indicated by the behavior of the power spectra for frequencies lower than the disks rotation rate @xmath68  fig .",
    "in addition , it is clear in figure  4(c ) that the lower end of the frequency spectra does depend on which induction mechanism is at work . in the case of an axial applied field ,",
    "the fluctuations in the toroidal component of the induction are related to fluctuations in the differential rotation .",

    "the fluctuations of induction are associated to fluctuations in the position of the stagnation point . concerning this slow dynamics ,",
    "we have also varied the disks rotation rate between 5  hz and 20  hz without detecting any noticeable change in the above features ; the spectra as in figure  4(c ) collapse when rescaled by the rotation rate and the fields @xmath74 amplitude .",

    "in addition , the points in the profiles tend to vary as a block .",
    "this is evidenced by computing the correlation function , between , say the first element in the array , and the progressively more distant ones .",
    "the resulting variation is shown in figure 6(a ) , where one observes that the maxima of the correlation functions decrease very slowly from 0.9 for the second element down to about 0.4 for the last one .",

    "we analyse further the profile fluctuations , with the purpose of trying to quantify how the induction deviates from the one expected from the mean flow .",

    "we do not claim here that the fitting functions are the actual solutions to the induction equation .",

    "the spectrum has a marked peak at a frequency @xmath133 , with the quasi - periodic evolution also reflected in the bimodal shape of the probability density function .     and induced component @xmath134 .",
    "( a ) time variation of the leading polynomial coefficient @xmath112 ( low - pass filtered at frequencies lower than 3  hz ) ; ( b , c ) time spectrum and probability density function of @xmath121 .",
    "measurement with counter - rotating disks at @xmath98  hz.,width=302 ]    in this configuration , the external magnetic field is transverse .",
    "the induced component probed is parallel to the applied field , and results from the compression of the applied field lines by the poloidal flow converging in the median plane .",
    "this effect strongly depends on the exact location of the shear layer  @xcite .",
    "its oscillations with respect to the mid - plane would generate oscillations as in fig .",
    "we note that these slow oscillations are reminiscent of the global instabilities of the median shear layer , previously discovered and studied in water prototypes by cea - saclay group  @xcite .",
    "in the last case discussed above , the fluctuations are attributed to the existence of large scale ( vortical ) structures , possibly due to the roll - up of the shear layer in the von krmn flow .",
    "when these structures exists , it is obvious that the flow is no longer in the averaged configuration pictured in figure  1(a ) .",
    "we would like to show now , that even if one discards the influence of these large scale coherent structures ( as we have done by high - pass filtering the data ) , the inherent turbulence of high reynolds number von krmn flows is such that the fluctuations in the instantaneous flow geometry are very large .",
    "the instantaneous flow configurations differ from the mean flow , not only in regards to the amplitude of the toroidal and poloidal velocity components , but also in regards to the symmetries and to the flow overall structure .",
    "we first comment again about the fluctuations , and we study in greater details the induction profile for the omega effect . in this case",
    "the induction is less sensitive to displacements of the mid - plane shear layer because the differential rotation is found to be rather uniform in the center of the flow  @xcite . for @xmath135 ,",
    "the @xmath112 coefficient should vanish because of axisymmetry .",
    "its actual fluctuations in time are shown in figure  13 .",
    "the mean value @xmath107 is equal to @xmath136  gauss ; although one expects @xmath115 , the recorded mean value is really within the precision of our polynomial analysis ( limited by the number of elements in the array probe ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath74 amplitude of fluctuations for @xmath112 is @xmath137  g ( for an applied field equal to 24  g ) , well above its mean .",
    "this is a significant variation , even when compared to the mean induction ( @xmath138  gauss ) .",
    "+      let us now discuss changes in the flow geometry .",
    "we compute how long the flow remains in the neighbourhood of its mean configuration , by imposing that both @xmath116 and @xmath112 take values within a standard deviation of their mean . in this case , one finds again that no longer than 50% of the time is spend in the mean von krmn geometry .",
    "we stress that : ( i ) a similar conclusion is reached if one does the estimation from induction effects generated by the presence of the stagnation point ( stretching of the axially applied field lines or compression of a transverse field ) ; ( ii ) the large changes in the polynomial coefficients are related to the long - time dynamics of the flow ( _ i.e. _ to frequencies lower than that of energy injection into the flow ) .    at the low magnetic reynolds numbers probed in this gallium experiment ,",
    "the above effects can be attributed to the hydrodynamics of the flow .",
    "note that such is not necessarily the case for sodium experiments in which non - linear induction processes  @xcite or dynamo  @xcite take place .",
    "the understanding of such long time dynamics in confined turbulent flows is a challenge .",
    "it has now been reported in several experiments ( e.g. recently in rayleigh - bnard convection  @xcite ) but its understanding is still elusive . for instance",
    "no known argument gives the time scale of the slowest motion .",
    "these slow global changes in the geometry of the flow may not favor dynamo action .",
    "first because all configurations may not be consistent with self generation  in the sense that the velocity field @xmath139 may not lead to a positive growth rate when inserted in the induction equation .",
    "second , in order for the the magnetic field to grow , the flow must be maintained for many kinetic advection times ; indeed one has for the magnetic diffusion time @xmath140 , with @xmath141 the time scale of the forcing .",
    "altogether these arguments indicate that a stable flow configuration is desirable for the self - generation of a stationary dynamo .",
    "for instance , for flows generated by the rotation of only one disk with the other kept at rest , we have observed that the fluctuations are much less  cf .",
    "figure  14 .",
    "the flow spends most of its time in the @xmath142 configuration imposed on average by the driving . as a result ,",
    "depending on the forcing and large scale hydrodynamic evolution of the flow , one may have to be cautious with approaches that estimate the dynamo threshold from mean flow geometries .",
    "this procedure may be valid for purely helical flows in which we have not detected strong fluctuations about the mean ; it certainly did yield a correct estimate of the onset of the riga dynamo  @xcite .",
    "however , it may not be the case for the flow generated by counter - rotation in the von krmn geometry .",
    "the observed slow dynamics is associated with important changes in the flow topology , and a mean field kinematic simulation may underestimate the threshold .",
