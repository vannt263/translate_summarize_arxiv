    "it has recently been pointed out @xcite that the persistent trend towards increased miniaturization of electronic devices implies that quantum effects will become important also for certain transport processes , for which so far classical models have been sufficient .",
    "an example of such a generalized transport equation , in the form the schrdinger ",
    "poisson equation was analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this analysis of a quantum plasma is based on the hydrodynamic formulation of the schrdinger ",
    "poisson system , where macroscopic plasma quantities such as density and average velocity are introduced .",
    "however , the analysis does not take into account statistical ( or kinetic ) effects associated with the finite width of the probability distribution function .",
    "kinetic effects are well - known in plasma physics , where they may lead to the phenomenon of landau damping .    the possibilities of using a general approach based on the wigner function @xcite was commented upon in ref.@xcite , but only a simpler approach based on macroscopic quantities was used . obviously , in doing so the possibilities of landau - damping like effects are lost . in fact , the possibility of obtaining landau damping is also mentioned in ref.@xcite , although in connection with a possible generalization to the multi - stream case , in accordance with the classical picture of dawson @xcite .",
    "particular attention was given to the classical one- and two stream instabilities in a cold plasma and it was shown that the main quantum effect on the wave propagation could be characterized as a generalized dispersion .",
    "however , recently much attention , within the nonlinear optics community , has been devoted to effects of partial wave incoherence e.g.in the form of phase noise on a constant amplitude wave @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the wigner transform was introduced as a means to study the modulational instability of an optical plane wave , that the phase noise gives rise to a landau - like damping effect on the one stream modulational instability .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to generalize the analysis made in ref .",
    "@xcite by analyzing the properties of the one- and two - stream instabilities in a quantum plasma using the wigner formalism and including the effect of phase noise developed in ref .",
    "the results clearly show the suppressing effect on the instabilities due to the landau - like damping effect caused by the phase noise of the wigner function .",
    "in non - relativistic many - body problems , the wigner transformation is a useful means to derive equations describing the quantum statistical dynamics of the system of interest .",
    "thus , one is able to generalize the classical vlasov equation to a quantum mechanical regime , in the sense that the dynamical equation for the wigner function describes particles moving in a self - consistent force field and in such a way that the evolution equation for the wigner function takes the form of its classical analogue in the limit @xmath0 .",

    "in fact , such effects may give rise to a landau - like damping both in the case of the single - stream and two - stream instabilities .    in order to take the statistical effects into account , it is convenient to introduce the wigner distribution function @xmath9 , corresponding to the wave function @xmath10 , as    @xmath11    which has the property @xmath12    using eq .",

    "another illustration of this is the small-@xmath68 expansion of the growth rate , which reads @xmath93    the stabilizing influence of @xmath87 in the general case of @xmath94 can be inferred as follows : + consider first the case of small @xmath68 , while keeping @xmath95 , i.e.  we investigate the growth rate close to the stability boundary . in this limit",

    "in this work , we have presented an analysis of a multi - stream quantum plasma , including the effect of phase noise in the beam wave function . as compared the fluid description of a quantum plasma used in ref .",
    "@xcite , the present analysis is based on the quantum mechanical wigner formalism .",
    "the phase noise , or partial incoherence , of the beam wave functions is shown to give rise to a landau - like damping effect , which tends to suppress the instabilities occurring in both the one- and two beam cases . the damping rate increases with increasing degree of incoherence as expressed by the width of the probability distribution function for the phase noise .",
    "the physical origin of this damping effect is the non - coherent properties of the beam wave function as opposed to the wave - particle interaction characteristic of the conventional landau damping .",
    "the new landau - like effect is not a true wave damping , but a conservative rearrangement of the spectrum of the beam wave function .",
    "this phenomenon has recently attracted considerable interest , both theoretically@xcite and experimentally @xcite , within the area of nonlinear optics , where it has been shown to suppress the modulational and self - focusing instabilities @xcite , e.g.  for optical beams in nonlinear photo - refractive media .",
