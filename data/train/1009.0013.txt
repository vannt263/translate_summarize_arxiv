    "the galaxy counts - in - cells distribution is a simple but powerful statistic which characterizes the locations of galaxies in space .",
    "it includes statistical information on voids and other underdense regions , on clusters of all shapes and sizes , on filaments , on the probability of finding an arbitrary number of neighbors around randomly located positions , on counts of galaxies in cells of arbitrary shapes and sizes randomly located , and on galaxy correlation functions of all orders .",
    "these are just some of its representations  @xcite . moreover it is also closely related to the distribution function of the peculiar velocities of galaxies around the hubble flow  @xcite .",
    "although the counts - in - cells distribution contains a large amount of information about galaxy clustering , it has not received as much attention as more common statistical descriptions of clustering such as the two - point correlation function .",
    "in addition , most earlier studies have focused on the counts - in - cells distribution for a magnitude - limited sample in projection  ( e.g. @xcite and references within ) .",
    "while there have been studies that have used redshift - limited samples  ( e.g. @xcite ) , their samples were generally smaller and their statistics were less precise .",
    "other studies have also examined the void probability function , which is a special case of the counts - in - cells distribution that describes the distribution of the volumes of voids , or regions with no galaxies .",
    "however , studies  @xcite have shown that the void probability function can be entirely described by the volume integral of the two - point correlation function @xmath2 and the mean number of galaxies in a cell @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that the void probability function alone is insufficient to completely describe the clustering of galaxies .",
    "to do so we would have to consider more than just voids .",
    "various statistical descriptions for the distribution function have been developed  ( for an early review see @xcite ) with the gravitational quasi - equilibrum distribution  ( gqed , @xcite ) and the negative binomial distribution  ( nbd , @xcite ) in common use . while the gqed can be derived from thermodynamics  @xcite and statistical mechanics  @xcite ,",
    "the nbd has been shown to violate the second law of thermodynamics by @xcite .",
    "observations however show a more complex picture .",
    "while the counts - in - cells distribution for the 2mass catalog in projection shows a good agreement with the gqed  @xcite , an analysis of the void probability function for the sdss and deep2 catalogs in redshift space by @xcite suggests a closer agreement with the nbd .",
    "this disagreement between projection and redshift space complicates our understanding of the theory behind the clustering of galaxies and raises a number of questions",
    ". why does the observed counts - in - cells distribution agree with the nbd in some cases and the gqed in others ?",
    "what are the conditions under which the counts - in - cells distribution agrees more closely with the gqed or nbd ? moreover , should the universe be allowed to violate the second law of thermodynamics ?    in section 2",
    "we describe the distribution functions and the information they contain .",
    "in particular , we describe the derivation and some aspects of the gqed and nbd . in section 3",
    ", we describe the procedure used to measure the counts in cells distribution from the sdss nyu - vagc catalog  @xcite . in section 4",
    "we present our results for the 2-point correlation function and @xmath4 . in section 5",
    "we summarize our findings .",
    "following @xcite , we use @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 .",
    "the most general form of the counts - in - cells distribution is denoted by @xmath10 which gives the probability of finding @xmath11 galaxies in a region of space with volume @xmath12 .",
    "there are two approaches to studying this distribution .",
    "the first approach is to let @xmath12 be constant resulting in @xmath4 which gives the distribution of the number of galaxies @xmath11 for cells of a given volume @xmath12 .",
    "this method is simple to use , yet powerful .",
    "the measurement of @xmath4 generally involves examining cells in 3d space or in projection and counting the number of galaxies in each cell .",
    "in addition , the moments of @xmath4 are closely related to the volume integrals of the correlation functions of all orders ( e.g. @xcite ) and the correlation functions can be measured from the moments of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "for example the relation between the volume integrals of the 2-point and 3-point correlation functions and the moments of the counts - in - cells distribution are given by @xmath13 where @xmath3 is the mean number of galaxies in a cell and the volume integral of the @xmath11-point correlation function @xmath14 with @xmath15 depends on the cell volume @xmath12 .",
    "this property allows us to compare the counts - in - cells results with observations of the two - point correlation function .    to get the measured value of the two - point correlation function",
    "@xmath16 we rewrite equation ( [ edist - vcorr ] ) for the 2-galaxy case as @xmath17 this is a conditional average correlation where one galaxy is located at the center of the volume so one power of @xmath12 in the denominator is removed by using polar coordinates relative to the central galaxy of the arbitrary volume .",
    "we can invert the integral using a finite difference scheme with an interval of @xmath18 to approximate the value of @xmath16 such that @xmath19 where from equation ( [ edist - corr ] ) @xmath20 and @xmath12 is the volume of the cell which depends on the shape of the cell .",
    "this gives us a means of determining the two - point correlation function from a series of measurements of @xmath4 over a range of scales .",
    "the other approach to studying @xmath21 is to let @xmath11 be constant resulting in @xmath22 which gives the distribution of the volume @xmath12 occupied by @xmath11 galaxies of which the void probability function  ( vpf ) , where @xmath23 , is a special case  ( e.g. @xcite ) . a theoretical approach to @xmath22",
    "is complicated by the fact that the distribution depends on the correlation function at all scales rather than a scale determined by a particular value of @xmath12 .",
    "this scale dependence can be found either empirically from the dependence of the variance of the @xmath4 distribution on @xmath12 , or from a model assumption of the form of @xmath24 .",
    "these give the analytic form of @xmath22 .",
    "to avoid these complications , most attempts to study @xmath22 have focused on the vpf because use of the reduced void probability  @xcite considerably simplifies the analysis by expressing @xmath25 in terms of @xmath26 .",
    "the reduced void probability , given by @xmath27 provides a means of isolating the scale - dependence of the void probability function because @xmath28 is a function that depends only on @xmath26 , and @xmath26 is easily derived from the variance of @xmath4 .",
    "however , this simplification is only possible for voids in the gqed and nbd because , for @xmath29 , @xmath22 depends on @xmath3 and @xmath2 separately .",
    "moreover , the void distribution is relatively insensitive to information on large cell sizes because large cells are unlikely to be completely empty . for these reasons we focus on the simpler @xmath4 approach in this paper and introduce the statistical descriptions of the counts - in - cells distribution .",
    "the gravitational quasi - equilibrium distribution was first derived from thermodynamics  @xcite and subsequently from statistical mechanics  @xcite by assuming that galaxy clustering evolves through a sequence of quasi - equilibrium states .",
    "the resulting distribution is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the average expected number of galaxies in a cell of volume @xmath12 and @xmath32 is the average number density of galaxies . here",
    "@xmath33 is the ratio of the gravitational correlation energy @xmath34 to twice the kinetic energy @xmath35 of peculiar velocities relative to the hubble flow and it represents a measure of clustering .",
    "a physical description of @xmath36 is given by @xcite to be @xmath37 which relates @xmath36 to the mass of a galaxy @xmath38 , the number density of galaxies @xmath32 and the kinetic temperature of the galaxies @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is the gravitational constant .",
    "originally an ansatz proposed by @xcite , the physical origin of @xmath36 was only later understood through work done by @xcite on the first and second laws of thermodynamics , and through the statistical mechanical derivation of the gqed by @xcite .",
    "we can relate the clustering parameter @xmath36 to the variance of the counts - in - cells distribution through @xmath41 which allows us to describe the clustering of galaxies with the gqed in a self - consistent manner with no free parameters .",
    "this also allows us to relate @xmath36 to the volume integral of the two - point correlation function such that @xmath42 which indicates that @xmath36 depends on @xmath2 and varies with cell volume @xmath12 .",
    "although the derivation of equation ( [ edist - gqed ] ) by @xcite was done assuming that all galaxies have the same mass , theoretical work by @xcite showed that the statistical mechanical framework can be extended to take into account population components of differing masses .",
    "in addition , @xmath11-body simulations by @xcite also showed that the gqed for the case where galaxies are of the same mass is often a good fit to @xmath11-body simulations where galaxies are allowed to take a range of masses .",
    "this suggests that the gqed given in equation ( [ edist - gqed ] ) is a reasonable approximation to the counts - in - cells distribution .",
    "together with the physical motivation behind its derivation , the gqed can be used to gain further insights into the physics behind the counts - in - cells distribution .",
    "the negative binomial distribution was proposed in the cosmological context by @xcite and subsequently derived by @xcite by describing the distribution as a statistical random process where @xmath11 galaxies are introduced in @xmath38 spatially disconnected boxes . in this model ,",
    "the probability that a galaxy is introduced in a particular box is proportional to the number of galaxies already inside the box .",
    "the resulting distribution is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a clustering parameter that depends on cell volume and @xmath45 is the standard gamma function .",
    "similar to the gqed , the nbd can also describe the counts - in - cells distribution self - consistently with no free parameters , and the clustering parameter @xmath46 is just @xmath2 .",
    "an alternative derivation of the nbd in the thermodynamic framework of @xcite is given by @xcite .",
    "in this case , the equivalent of @xmath36 is given by @xmath47 although this form fulfils @xmath48 , it was found to violate the second law of thermodynamics by @xcite which suggests that the nbd is not physically motivated",
    ". a closer look at the statistical random process from which the nbd was derived suggests that the nbd assumes galaxies form where there is already a cluster of galaxies .",
    "this process does not take infall into account , and hence the depletion of regions outside a cluster that occur in the process of infall is not taken into account .    from the derivation of the nbd by @xcite , we note that the nbd can describe the case where galaxies form from the merger of less massive objects . in this description",
    ", the less massive objects can be expected to follow the gqed , but not all of them can be observed .",
    "these objects may merge to form objects bright enough to be observed , and their locations are likely to be in denser regions that contain a higher density of fainter objects .",
    "@xmath11-body simulations by @xcite show that while the vpf for galaxies follows the nbd , the vpf for dark matter particles follows the gqed .",
    "while this qualitative explanation may seem plausible , a detailed quantitative analysis will depend on the physics of the more complicated halo occupation distribution .",
    "the new york university value - added galaxy catalog  ( nyu - vagc , @xcite ) is a composite catalog with the sloan digital sky survey  ( sdss ) data as its primary component .",
    "it contains over 550,000 galaxies with their redshifts and positions on the sky .",
    "the catalog also contains extinction corrected and @xmath35-corrected absolute magnitudes for 8 bands , of which the @xmath49 , @xmath46 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 bands come from the sdss and the @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 bands come from the 2-micron all - sky survey  ( 2mass ) although for this study we use only the data from the sdss .",
    "the galaxies in the catalog are also corrected for fiber collisions using the `` nearest '' method described in @xcite .",
    "less that @xmath56 of the galaxies are affected by this correction which allows for a more complete sample in crowded regions .",
    "in addition to the galaxy catalog , the nyu - vagc also contains a survey geometry catalog that describes the survey footprint in terms of spherical polygons  ( described in @xcite ) .",
    "since the sdss is not an all - sky survey , the survey footprint determines the positions of cells and allows us to lay down cells where there is valid data .    for this work ,",
    "we use the large scale structure samples in the version of the catalog corresponding to the seventh data release of the sdss  ( * ? ? ?",
    "we use the subsample with a flux limit of @xmath57 and perform further selection cuts based on the properties of the sample . in particular",
    ", we choose absolute magnitude cuts to obtain a complete sample within a given redshift range .",
    "we consider two redshift ranges in the @xmath46 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 bands at @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the low redshift limit of @xmath60 ensures that the sample is within the hubble flow , and excludes the coma and virgo clusters . since the sdss `` great wall '' spans a redshift range of @xmath61  @xcite , it is fully contained within the low redshift range .",
    "this allows us to isolate the effect of the `` great wall '' by comparing the low redshift range to the high redshift range .    to determine a suitable absolute magnitude cut",
    ", we define the faint limit @xmath62 as the absolute magnitude where the observed luminosity function begins to turn over because the limiting magnitude has been reached .",
    "this means that for a faint limit @xmath62 and limiting redshift @xmath63 , the comoving number density of galaxies @xmath64 brighter than @xmath62 should be the approximately the same for any limiting redshift @xmath65 .",
    "we obtain @xmath62 by comparing @xmath64 for a redshift range with a lower redshift subset of the same range . for the low range",
    ", we compare the range @xmath66 with the range @xmath67 and for the high redshift range we compare the range @xmath68 with the range @xmath69 .",
    "the optimal faint limit @xmath62 which gives us the largest complete sample occurs where the compared values of @xmath64 are approximately equal .",
    "we find that the lower redshift range is complete for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 while the higher redshift range is complete for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we plot these limits on the observed luminosity function at @xmath58 and @xmath59 in figure [ fdata - lf ] and summarize the subsamples we use in table [ tdata - zcut ] .",

    "hence any large differences in clustering between the samples of different color should arise from selection effects that depend on color .",
    "an analysis by found systematic variations between different subvolumes of the sdss catalog on scales larger than @xmath97 mpc such that these subvolumes are not statistically similar .",
    "these variations are likely to be caused by cosmic variance that our analysis should take into account .",
    "we use two approaches to analyze the effect of cosmic variance on our results .",
    "the first is simply to consider independent subfields of the survey footprint . to ensure that effects of galactic latitude , distance and lookback time are constant across all subsamples , we compute and compare the counts - in - cells distribution for cells in non - overlapping quadrants in galactic longitude .",
    "the size of quadrants is also comparable with the size of the sdss `` great wall '' which spans @xmath98  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "all cells that belong to a quadrant are fully - contained within the selected quadrant .",
    "this gives us a picture of the variations among widely separated areas of the sky .",
    "we consider subsamples in four quadrants such that for galactic longitude @xmath99 , quadrant 1  ( q1 ) covers @xmath100 , quadrant 2  ( q2 ) covers @xmath101 , quadrant 3  ( q3 ) covers @xmath102 and quadrant 4  ( q4 ) covers @xmath103 .",
    "for some samples , we also examine the quadrant to quadrant variations where the quadrant boundaries boundaries have been shifted by @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 in galactic longitude to check that any variation between quadrants is not caused by our choice of quadrant boundaries .",
    "moreover , we have varied the size of subsamples and found that for smaller subsamples , _",
    "e.g. _ sixths rather than quadrants , the subsample to subsample variations are smaller than for larger subsamples .",
    "however , subsamples that are too large will not be independent , and there will be too few of them to provide an accurate estimate of the cosmic variance between disconnected regions of the sky . therefore quadrants are a reasonable subsample size to use .",
    "the second approach is a jackknife - style approach where we leave out cells that fall within a region of the sky , selected based on a quasi - random sequence from @xcite such that each part of the survey region is equally likely to be chosen for exclusion . for our analysis",
    ", we use 1000 different exclusion regions which are circular with a radius of @xmath107 .",
    "this corresponds to a transverse distance of about @xmath108 mpc at @xmath109 and an area of approximately 10% of the sdss footprint for a `` leave 10% out '' jackknife procedure from which we can determine the 1-@xmath110 error .    here",
    "we wish to stress that the jackknife errors are only valid in the case where the sdss catalog is a representative sample of the universe .",
    "this condition essentially requires the universe to be statistically homogenous at scales larger than the sdss footprint .",
    "if this requirement is not met , the errors will not be meaningful because the sample is not a representative sample of the universe .      to obtain the counts - in - cells distribution",
    ", we take a sample of cells whose positions are evenly distributed over the survey footprint .",
    "to sample the galaxies efficiently , we use a number of cells approximately equal to the number of galaxies , so based on table [ tdata - zcut ] we use a sample of approximately @xmath111 cells .    to ensure that the entire survey footprint is sampled without bias to any particular region of space , we use the following procedure .",
    "we first define an `` instance '' as a set of cells that tile the entire survey region with a consistent amount of overlap .",
    "for small cell sizes , a single instance provides enough cells for reliable statistics . for larger cell sizes , we use multiple instances for efficient sampling . to do so , we displace the origin of each subsequent instance by a quasi - random sequence from @xciteso that cells from no two instances exactly line up with each other .",
    "because we may be dealing with cells on small scales and because cells are allowed to overlap , adjacent cells are generally not independent and hence we can not use statistical tests which assume samples are independent .    since the sdss is not an all - sky survey",
    ", we also check each cell against the survey coverage area .",
    "we express the projected extent of each cell in terms of spherical polygons and check these against the survey geometry of the nyu - vagc .",
    "we use the mangle software package  @xcite to combine the survey geometry and the bright star mask into a combined exclusion mask that removes areas that are either not in the sdss or are obscured by a foreground object .",
    "in addition , we also discard regions with a galactic latitude below @xmath112 to further minimize foreground contamination from the galaxy .    to accept or reject a cell , we use mangle to compute the overlap between the combined exclusion mask and the cell . since cells may be partly obscured by foreground objects even if they are well within the contiguous region of the survey , we accept cells that have less than @xmath113 of their area masked out .",
    "this allows cells to have small regions that may be obscured by foreground objects while having a minor effect of less than 5% on our statistics .",
    "the counts - in - cells distribution @xmath4 is then obtained by taking the histogram of the number of galaxies within a cell . for this study",
    ", we consider 2-dimensional circular cells projected on the sky and 3-dimensional spherical cells in redshift space .",
    "for the study of the 2-dimensional projected cells , we use circular cells because their areas and membership are simple to calculate .",
    "such cells can be represented by only two parameters , the cell radius @xmath114 and the position of the cell center .",
    "this allows the cell to be described as a spherical polygon with only one cap which is easily processed by mangle .",
    "the area of a circular cell in steradians is given by @xmath115 , and a galaxy is a member of a cell if the great circle distance between the galaxy and the cell center is less than @xmath114 .    with a redshift limited sample defined such that the redshift @xmath52 falls in the range @xmath116",

    "for each instance , we place cell centers on a square grid overlaid on this projection at intervals of @xmath123 .",
    "subsequent projections will have @xmath124 and @xmath125 shuffled by an amount less than @xmath123 .",
    "for the 2d sample we consider cells with radii between @xmath126 and @xmath127 in steps of @xmath126 .",
    "for 3-dimensional cells in redshift space , we use spherical cells because they are simple to analyse .",
    "for example , the simplest form of equation ( [ edist - vcorr ] ) applies to spherical cells , and such cells can be described by just their location and radius @xmath50 .    to obtain the 3d counts - in - cells distribution in redshift space ,",
    "we first convert redshift space into cartesian coordinates using ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath128 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 refer to the j2000.0 right ascension and declination respectively , and @xmath129 is the comoving distance given by equation ( [ edata - zdist ] ) . for each instance , we place cell centers on a cartesian grid with spacings of @xmath130 .",
    "subsequent instances will have the origin of the grid shuffled by an amount less than @xmath130 .",
    "for the 3d sample we consider cells with radii between @xmath131 mpc and @xmath132 mpc in steps of @xmath133 mpc .",
    "since we work in comoving coordinates , the resulting projected area of a cell is a circle about the cell center of angular radius @xmath134 where @xmath50 is the radius of the cell in comoving coordinates .",
    "the cell center is also easily obtained from @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath135 .",
    "hence , we can define a spherical polygon that represents the footprint of the cell on the sky in a manner similar to what we have used for the case of 2d cells .    to get the positions of galaxies in redshift space ,",
    "we apply the transformation in equation ( [ edata - xcart ] ) .",
    "then a galaxy is a member of a cell if the distance between the galaxy and cell center is less than @xmath50 .",
    "since the two - point correlation function is a well - studied description of clustering , we first compute the two - point correlation functions @xmath16 from the counts - in - cells distribution using equation ( [ edist - xibvar ] ) and compare our results with earlier works .",
    "this allows us to check the validity of our data and method by comparing our results to results from previous studies .    for this study , we focus on the power law approximation of the two - point correlation function since we are dealing with small scales .",

    "as expected , our results show large differences in @xmath3 , @xmath36 and @xmath46 between quadrants . comparing the observed counts - in - cells distribution between the gqed and nbd , based on the least squares distance alone , @xmath4 for 2d projected cells tend to follow the gqed while @xmath4 for 3d spherical cells tend to follow the nbd . however , in most cases , the gqed and nbd both fall within the measured quadrant to quadrant variations , and we note that the observed @xmath4 for individual quadrants within a sample may be closer to the gqed or nbd .",
    "this shows that the sdss catalog is unable to distinguish between the gqed and nbd because the difference between the gqed and nbd is smaller than the quadrant to quadrant variations . since the nbd has been shown to be unphysical  @xcite , on physical grounds we use the gqed for further analysis .",
    "comparing the values of @xmath3 and @xmath36 , between redshift ranges , we note that the values of @xmath3 and correspondingly @xmath36 are lower in the low redshift range than in the high redshift range for the same magnitude cutoff  ( samples 1b and 2b ) .",
    "this is despite the presence of the sdss `` great wall '' in the low redshift range .    on a closer look",
    ", we note that the `` great wall '' spans the region between @xmath61 , @xmath845 and @xmath846  @xcite which is a small fraction of the sdss footprint .",
    "the observed quadrant to quadrant variations of @xmath4 do not seem to depart much from the gqed , so the presence of a large supercluster probably does not affect the observed form of @xmath4 .",
    "this result is in agreement with an earlier analysis of the 2mass catalog by @xcite where it was found that the inclusion of the shapley supercluster did not make a large difference on the agreement with the gqed .",
    "therefore these large superclusters may be natural consequences of gravitational interactions among galaxies .",
    "since the `` great wall '' probably does not make a large contribution to the counts - in - cells statistics , the difference in @xmath3 and @xmath36 between the high and low redshift ranges could be due to evolution or selection .",
    "further pursuit of these possibilities requires more detailed models .",
    "here we note that the difference is consistent across quadrants which rules out cosmic variance as a dominant cause .",
    "we also note that the difference in lookback time between the middle of the low and high redshift ranges is about 0.7 gyr , which is close to the amount of time a merging pair of galaxies takes to merge  @xcite so we can expect that the effect of galaxy mergers might make a difference between the low and high redshift range .",
    "as expected from different magnitude cutoffs , the values of @xmath3 and @xmath36 are lower for the brighter 1b sample than the fainter 1a sample .",
    "we can compare the value of @xmath36 for the brighter sample with the expected value of @xmath36 if the brighter sample is a randomly selected sample from a fainter parent sample using  @xcite : @xmath847 this allows us to compare the clustering of the brighter 1a sample with the fainter 1b sample .",
    "we find that for all samples , the brighter galaxies from the 1b samples have a higher value of @xmath36 than would be expected if they were a random subsample of the 1a sample .",
    "this means that bright galaxies are more strongly clustered than fainter galaxies which may be a result of brighter galaxies being concentrated around cluster centers , or in dark matter haloes .",
    "if so , it suggests an upper limit of about @xmath848 mpc for the size of these haloes .",

    "in this paper we have compared the counts - in - cells distribution of galaxies @xmath4 with two theoretical models and found that the observed distribution has large field to field variations which may be as great as @xmath0 across quadrants .",
    "these large variations essentially mean that there is a considerable amount of cosmic variance in the data , and that the galaxies in different quadrants are not identically distributed .",
    "this also means that errors determined using the jackknife procedure will underestimate the true range of variation in the data because different subsets of the data are not identically distributed .",
    "we see the existence of these subregions of different local density from the bumps in the counts - in - cells distribution for large cells .",
    "we note that as shown by @xcite , these bumps may be the result of regions of different local density .    as suggested by",
    ", a larger survey volume will show less effects of cosmic variance , and an earlier analysis of the 2mass catalog by @xcite provides a hint that this may be the case . in the 2mass analysis",
    ", @xcite found less variation between quadrants , on the order of @xmath113 instead of the @xmath0 we have found in the sdss .",
    "we note that after excluding regions close to the galactic plane using @xmath850 , the 2mass catalog covers two - thirds of the sky , a coverage that is more than three times that of the sdss .",
    "although the sdss `` great wall '' is contained within the low redshift range , it covers only a small fraction of the sdss footprint in a stripe within @xmath851 of the celestial equator . for this reason we do not see much difference between the low redshift range and the high redshift range beyond differences in @xmath3 because the overdensity in the `` great wall '' is not large enough to dominate over the rest of the survey . indeed , because the `` great wall '' is most likely porous in three dimensions , it is not clear that `` great wall '' is an accurate description .",
    "our comparison of @xmath139 for 2d projected cells and 3d spherical cells in redshift space shows that there is a difference in the exponent @xmath139 of the two - point correlation function between the 2d and 3d sample .",
    "the 3d samples have a value of @xmath139 that is lower than that for the 2d samples because the 3d samples in redshift space are affected by peculiar velocity distortions which change the apparent clustering in redshift space . using the well - known relation between the projected correlation function and the real space correlation function",
    "we find that the difference in @xmath139 between the 2d and 3d samples is a measure of the redshift space distortions .",
    "our findings for the value of @xmath139 suggest that the difference between the projected sample and redshift space sample is about @xmath339 in agreement with work by @xcite and @xcite using earlier catalogs .    comparing the low redshift and high redshift range",
    ", we find that there is a large difference in @xmath3 between the low and high redshift range for samples with the same magnitude cutoff which may be caused by galaxy mergers .",
    "we also find that brighter galaxies are more strongly clustered than a random subset of all galaxies in the low redshift range , which may be a result of bright galaxies clustering around cluster centers or dark matter haloes .",
    "the analysis of the counts - in - cells distribution shows that the observed @xmath4 may follow the gqed or nbd , and 2d projected cells generally prefer the gqed while 3d spherical cells often prefer the nbd .",
    "however , both distributions are generally within the range of quadrant to quadrant variations so we can conclude that both the gqed or nbd are in agreement with observations .",
    "since the gqed is physically motivated while the nbd was found to be unphysical , we can reject the nbd as a physically complete description of galaxy clustering .",
    "this conclusion is not at odds with the results of @xcite because although the error bars in @xcite excludes the gqed , jackknife errors were used which , as our results suggest , underestimate the true range of variability in the data .",
    "we conclude that while the sdss is an excellent sample , there remains a considerable amount of cosmic variance that will probably require an all - sky survey to resolve .",
    "nevertheless , the counts - in - cells analysis of the sdss data has shown that observations of @xmath4 agree with the gqed within cosmic variance .",
