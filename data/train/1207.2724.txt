    "<S> we present high - spatial resolution imaging obtained with the submillimeter array ( sma ) at 880@xmath0 m and the keck  adaptive optics  ( ao ) system at @xmath1-band of a gravitationally lensed sub - millimeter galaxy ( smg ) at @xmath2 discovered in the _ herschel _  astrophysical terahertz large area survey . </S>",
    "<S> the sma data ( angular resolution @xmath3 ) resolve the dust emission into multiple lensed images , while the keck  ao @xmath1-band data ( angular resolution @xmath4 ) resolve the lens into a pair of galaxies separated by @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we present an optical spectrum of the foreground lens obtained with the gemini - south telescope that provides a lens redshift of  @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we develop and apply a new lens modeling technique in the visibility plane that shows that the  smg is magnified by a factor of @xmath7 and has an intrinsic infrared ( ir ) luminosity of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a half - light radius of the background source of @xmath9kpc which implies an ir luminosity surface density of @xmath10kpc@xmath11 , a value that is typical of @xmath12 smgs but significantly lower than ir luminous galaxies at  @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the two lens galaxies are compact ( @xmath14kpc ) early - types with einstein radii of @xmath15 and @xmath16 that imply masses of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the two lensing galaxies are likely about to undergo a dissipationless merger , and the mass and size of the resultant system should be similar to other early - type galaxies at @xmath19 . </S>",
