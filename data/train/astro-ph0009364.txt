    "it was the study of simkin , su , and schwarz ( 1980 ) that revealed a more frequent occurrence of outer and inner rings in the host galaxies of seyferts than those of non - seyfert galaxies .",
    "this pioneering investigation has been confirmed recently ( hunt & malkan 1999 ) of the possible connection between the host galaxies and nuclear activities .",
    "the galaxy morphology can be modified by environmental effects , such as mergers or interactions .",
    "it could be formed , on the other hand , as an evolutionary sequence ( martinet 1995 ) , without galaxy interactions .",
    "the role of minor mergers in the formation of agn has been tested by corbin ( 2000 ) .",
    "a very intriguing result obtained from this study is that the nuclear spectral type of galaxies is strongly dependent on their hubble type instead of environmental effects , indicating the existence of a connection between the host galaxy and nuclear activity .    when condon et al .",
    "suggested ( 1982 ) , and rush et al .",
    "( 1996 ) conducted , to distinguish starbursts from agn by using of fir - radio correlation , the possible connection between the host galaxy and nuclear activity is involved .",
    "the nuclear spectral types of sources can be designated by their global properties .",
    "the fir - radio correlation has proven a useful tool successfully classifying the liners type , liner 1s and liner 2s , in recent investigation ( ji et al.2000 ) . in their study on a small sample of liners ,",
    "a higher frequency of inner rings in liners found by hunt & malkan ( 1999 ) turned out to be related to liner 2s .",
    "it is worth exploring the astrophysical implication of this result , especially for understanding a possible connection between the host galaxy and nuclear activity , or even further a possible connection between starbursts and agn in terms of the evolution of galaxies .",
    "to faciliatate the study of active nuclei and their hosts , it is desirable to utilize a liner sample on the basis of host galaxy flux ( krolik 1999 ) .",
    "one of the best sample in the literature is the spectroscopic survey by ho , filippenko and sargent ( 1997 , hfs hereafter ) , from which we have a magnitude - limited liner sample , with a statistically meaningful size of 94 .    a second , and deeper , magnitude - limited liner sample has been constructed from a catalog of liner compiled by carrillo et al .",
    "( 1999 , cmd hereafter ) , which is based on criteria of m@xmath2 14.5 and @xmath3 .",
    "the cmd sample contains 223 sources .",
    "in order to test a possible connection between the host galaxies and nuclear activities , we need to study the star - formation activity among liner samples , along with their agn activity . as an indicator of star - formation activity , the luminosity ratio of @xmath0 has been widely used ( keel 1993 , huang et al .",
    "1996 , hunt & malkan 1999 ) . on the other hand , the mid - infrared flux ratio f(25)/f(60 ) has been known a good indicator of agn activity ( hunt & malkan 1999 ) .",
    "following hunt & malkan ( 1999 ) , we make plots of f(25)/f(60 ) vs hubble - type index for the hfs sample and the cmd sample in fig 1a and 1b respectively .",
    "significant correlations between them , @xmath199.99% for the hfs sample and @xmath199.99% for the cmd sample , imply a possible relation of nuclear activity to the evolutionary status of galaxy , similar to the results obtained by corbin ( 2000 ) and hunt & malkan ( 1999 ) for agn .",
    "the different distributions shown in fig 1a and 1b lie mostly in the lack of liners in late - types for the hfs sample , as compared with those for the cmd sample .",
    "it is something related to the selection effect in the hfs sample , which makes it harder to find agn in late - type galaxies .",
    "though the cmd sample is not complete for sources with 12.5 @xmath4 14.5 , the situation is much improved .",
    "this selection effect may cause some problems on the study of evolutionary status of agn activity along the hubble sequence .",
    "however , it is not crucial for our investigation as the statistics given above indicated .    in fig 2",
    "we have shown the star - formation indicator of @xmath0 vs hubble - type index for the cmd sample only .",
    "the correlation is significant at the level of @xmath199.99% .",
    "what the trend in fig 2 shows is certainly consistent with the fact that hubble - type sequence is also a sequence of star formation rate ( kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "the most active star formation occurs in late - type spirals .",
    "in fact , the majority of liners with inner rings are located in these types , see fig 1 and 2 .",
    "there are other significant indicators for star - formation or agn activity , such as the nuclear mass - to - light ratio at h band , @xmath5 , and the ratio of x - ray - to - uv power , @xmath6(2 - 10kev)/@xmath6(1300 ) ( oliva et al . 1999 ; maoz et al .",
    "1998 ) .    a diagram of @xmath5 vs f(25)/f(60 ) for seyferts is shown in fig 3a with the @xmath5 data obtained by oliva et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which again demonstrates the f(25)/f(60 ) ratio as a good indicator of agn activity .",
    "the sources in the lower - left part of the diagram are seyfert 2 with circum - nuclear starbursts , while those in the upper - right part are seyfert 1 without circum - nuclear starbursts .",
    "the trend shown in fig 3a might provide evidence for the evolutionary hypothesis for seyferts ( hunt & malkan 1999 ) .    following this approach",
    ", we made a similar plot for liners in fig 3b , with the @xmath5 data obtained by devereux et al .",
    "the correlation between @xmath5 and f(25)/f(60 ) is significant at 97% level .",
    "two sources shown with symbol of star , ngc1052 and ngc4486 , are those with the @xmath5 data obtained by oliva et al .",
    "the systematic difference between the two observations is obvious , as it can be seen from different positions of the same object , ngc1052 .",
    "further evidence for this evolutionary trend might be provided using another agn activity , i.e. the ratio of x - ray - to - uv power .",
    "due to the limited liners with both x - ray detections and the uv observations , we use the einstein data ( carrillo et al .",
    "1999 ) for the x - ray fluxes instead of the hard x - ray fluxes used by maoz et al .",
    "the uv fluxes are retrieved from the iue archive data .",
    "the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath6(0.2 - 4.0kev)/@xmath6(1300 ) is shown in fig 4 , significant at 99% level .",
    "a key point in agn unification hypotheses is to claim that seyfert 1s and 2s are intrinsically similar , and the different types of nuclear activity are caused by different view angles . increasing evidence ( malkan et al .",
    "1998 ; hunt et al .",
    "1999 ) suggests that seyfert nuclei may be same objects seen at different evolutionary sequence .",
    "seyfert 2s tend to reside in later morphological types than seyfert 1s .",
    "starbursts and massive stars play an important energetic role in a significant fraction of seyfert 2s ( heckman 1999 ) , while few seyfert 1s have such circum - nuclear starbursts ( gonzalez delgado et al .",
    "1997 ; hunt et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the data points in the lower right part of fig . 4 of the diagram have higher ratio of @xmath6(0.2 - 4.0kev)/@xmath6(1300 ) and lower ratio of @xmath0 , in other words , have higher agn activity and lower star - formation contributions .",
    "it is the region the well studied liners with broad   emission or with active agn are located at , e.g. ngc3998 , ngc4486 , ngc4594(larkin et al .",
    "1998 ; ho 1998 ; nicholson et al . 1998",
    "; maoz et al .",
    "we have found few liners with inner rings in this region .",
    "sources with the highest agn activity and the lowest star - formation contributions are absolutely ellipticals . it has been known that most of x - rays detected in ellipticals come from the extended halo where elliptical galaxies reside . removing these ellipticals from the sample used in fig 4 ,",
    "the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath6(0.2 - 4.0kev)/@xmath6(1300 ) becomes significant at 90% level .    on the contrary , the sources shown in the upper left part of the figure have lower ratio of @xmath6(0.2 - 4.0kev)/@xmath6(1300 ) and higher ratio of @xmath0 , i.e. lower agn contribution and higher star - formation activity .",
    "it is the region some well studied liners supported by massive stars are found , e.g. ngc4569 , ngc4736 , ngc4826 , ngc5194 ( maoz et al . 1998 ; larkin et al .",
    "1998 ; alonso - herrero et al .",
    "1999 ; barth & shields 2000 ) .",
    "the above argument holds for fig .",
    "the agn - supported liners , ngc1052 , ngc4579 , ngc4486 , are distributed in the region with higher ratio of f(25)/f(60 ) ( strong agn activity ) and higher nuclear @xmath5 ( small starburst contribution ) . while ngc7217 , a well studied starburst(sb)-supported liner , is in the region having higher star - formation activity and lower agn contribution .    if adopting the hubble sequence as an evolutionary sequence ( pfenniger , combes & martinet 1994 , martinet 1995 ) , the correlations in fig 1 and 2 show that the agn and the star - formation activity are anticorrelated to the evolutionary status of galaxies .",
    "along with the evolution from late - type spirals to early - type ones , and up to ellipticals , the intensity of agn activity in liners increases with decrease of star - formation contributions , consistent with what the statistics performed for fig 3 and 4 implied . due to the large sample size used for fig 1 and 2 , more well studied liners ,",
    "agn- or sb - supported , can be found in their corresponding regions , e.g. sb - supported liners ngc404 , ngc3504 , ngc5055 , ngc7743 ( maoz et al . 1998 ; alonso - herrero et al .",
    "1999 ; larkin et al 1998 ) , and agn - supported ones ngc2639 , ngc3718 , ngc4203 , ngc4278 , ngc6500 ( alonso - herrero et al . 1999 ; ho 1998 ; iyomoto et al .",
    "1998 ; shields et al .",
    "2000 ; falcke et al .",
    "1999 ; maoz et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "probably , this evolutionary trend might indicate processes in which massive black holes in liners are competing with the starbursts for the inflowing gas , a suggestion proposed by de carvalho & coziol ( 1999 ) .",
    "the liners residing in late - type spirals , with strong star - formation and lower agn activity , might be at an early evolutionary stage .",
    "they are liner 2s .",
    "the growing bulges of galaxies are bound to be followed by the evolution of galaxies from late - type to early - type spirals .",
    "the formation of a massive black hole may turn out to be a natural evolution of the massive bulges of galaxies ( norman & scoville 1988 ) .",
    "ellipticals , s0 galaxies and very early - type spirals containing liners with broad   emission or active agn have massive bulges for the formation of massive or supermassive black holes ( wandel 1999 ; margorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , being active enough to suppress the circum - nuclear starbursts in liners .",
    "these liners might be at late evolutionary stages of liners , they are liner 1s .    in conclusion , the above analyses may suggest a possible connection between the host galaxies and nuclear activities , and it might also indicate a possible evolutionary connection between agn and starburst in liners .",
