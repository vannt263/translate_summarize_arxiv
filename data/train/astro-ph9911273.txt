    "soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are _ transient _ binary systems that consist of a black hole primary and a distorted ( i.e. roche lobe filling ) , late type , cool dwarf secondary .",

    "their outbursts result from a sudden , dramatic increase in the accretion rate onto the compact object .",
    "sxts show a _",
    "soft _ spectra compared to other x - ray sources .",
    "the secondary stars are visible and dominate the systemic infrared luminosity in quiescence , allowing us to observe and model the ellipsoidal variations of the secondary star as it orbits the primary .",
    "the most difficult parameter to determine when estimating the mass of the primary is the orbital inclination , @xmath4 .",
    "since the known sxts are not eclipsing , @xmath4 can only be determined through the modeling of ellipsoidal variations .",
    "ellipsoidal variations result from the rotational and tidal distortions of the roche lobe filling secondary star and its non - uniform surface brightness distribution ( limb darkening , gravity brightening ) . in the infrared ,",
    "the secondary stars of stxs are brighter , and the variations are much less contaminated by any residual accretion disk or hot spot than in the optical regime .    to construct the gs2000 + 25 j - band light curve shown in fig .",

    "the current wd98 model indicates an inclination angle of @xmath0 and a resulting mass of @xmath7 .",
    "no outburst x - ray eclipses were observed , so @xmath0 represents the upper limit of allowable inclinations .",
    "more data is needed to fill in the gaps in the light curve and better define the minima .",
    "each night of data has been carefully normalized , but until we have a data set that covers both a minima and maxima , the true maximum to minimum amplitude can not be conclusively determined .",
    "note that the circular orbit model does not fit the light curve perfectly .",
    "the possibility of an eccentric orbit will be explored once the minima are more clearly defined .",
    "if this system were to have an elliptical orbit , it would be an unexpected , yet important discovery ."
