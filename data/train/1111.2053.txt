    "winds from stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and super - asymptotic giant branch ( sagb ) provide an important component of mass return into the interstellar medium ( ism ) and account for a significant fraction of interstellar dust in present - day mature galaxies ( zhukovska , gail & trieloff 2008 ; sloan et al .",

    "grain formation is far from being complete ( for a comprehensive review see h@xmath11fner 2009 ) : dust grain properties depend on dynamical aspects of the stellar wind , and on the surface chemical composition of the star .",
    "shock waves caused by stellar pulsations lift the gas above the stellar surface intermittently creating dense cool layers where grain condensation can occurr . provided that their cross sections are large enough",
    ", the newly formed dust grains can be accelerated by radiation pressure and collisionally couple to the gas , dragging it along .",
    "time  independent wind models , though limited in their capability of reproducing important properties of the dynamical atmosphere with shocks , can reproduce certain observed features , such as the observed spectral energy distribution of c  rich stars with high mass loss rates .",
    "compared to the problem of computing reliable mass loss rates ,",
    "the problem of calculating dust yields has the additional complication of estimating the fraction of elements condensing into various types of dust species , which , in turn , depends on the changes in the surface chemistry of the star determined by the interplay between nucleosynthesis and convection .    the most extensive study so far has been made by ferrarotti & gail ( 2006 ) . using synthetic stellar evolution models , they compute the non - equilibrium dust formation and estimate dust yields for m , s , and c  type agbs .",
    "synthetic agb models are useful tools , due to the relatively short computation time required and the simplicity with which they can be incorporated in stellar population synthesis studies . on the other hand",
    ", they have no predictive power on some key physical processes that occurr during agb evolution , such as the hot bottom burning experienced at the bottom of the convective envelope .",
    "a proper description of these processes and of their impact on dust formation demands the full integration of the stellar structure .    to progress in this direction ,",
    "the aim of the present investigation is to estimate the mass and composition of dust formed around agbs using models that follow stellar evolution from the pre ",
    "main sequence phase .",
    "this enables the computation of the time evolution of the surface chemistry and of the mass loss rate in a self  consistent way , providing an important benchmark for studies based on synthetic modelling . using the proper stellar evolutionary sequences ,",
    "we also apply the dust formation model to winds of sagb stars , whose dust yields have not been studied so far .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the description of the codes used to calculate the agb and sagb evolution , the wind structure and dust formation are described in sect.2 ; the main physical processes which affect the surface chemistry of these stars are discussed in sect.3 . in sect.4",
    "we present the resulting dust mass and composition for stars with masses in the range @xmath0 and with initial metallicity of @xmath1 ; we assess the robustness of these results and discuss the effects of uncertain physical processes in sect.5 . finally , in sect .",
    "6 we compare our predictions with alternative dust yields present in the literature and in sect .",
    "7 we summarize the main conclusions .",
    "to address the issue of dust production by agb stars , we developed a specific tool to calculate the structure of the wind around the central object as well as the mass and composition of the newly formed dust .",
    "these properties depend on the luminosity , effective temperature and mass loss rate experienced by the star , and on the surface chemical composition . in the following ,",
    "we provide a description of the numerical code used to integrate the stellar evolution , the aton code , and of the code used to estimate the stellar wind structure and dust formation .      the evolution of the stars , from their pre main sequence phase , until the almost complete ejection of their external mantle , was computed by means of the code aton @xcite which integrates spherically symmetric structures in hydrostatic equilibrium",
    ". an exaustive description of the code is beyond the scope of the present study and we refer the interested reader to the original paper . here",
    "we briefly recall those features which affect the thermodynamics and chemical composition of the wind where dust nucleation occurs .",
    "the temperature gradient within regions unstable to convection is determined via the full spectrum of turbulence ( @xcite , hereinafter fst ) model for turbulent convection ; the code allows the alternative mixing length theory ( mlt ) treatment @xcite .",
    "mixing of chemicals within nuclearly active regions is handled by means of a diffusive approach : for each of the species included in the nuclear network we solve the diffusive equation following the scheme by @xcite , which couples self  consistently nuclear burning and mixing of chemicals .",
    "the extra  mixing ( overshooting ) from the convective borders is simulated by an exponential decay of velocities from the neutrality point , where buoyancy vanishes ; the scale of this phenomenon is assumed to be @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the pressure scale height . in agreement with the calibration based on the fit of the observed main sequences of open clusters given in @xcite , we assume @xmath14 to simulate overshoot from the border of the convective cores during the two major phases of core hydrogen and helium burning . to limit the number of free parameters , we assumed no extra - mixing from the base of the convective envelope during the giant evolution , and during the agb phase .",
    "this choice renders the extent of the third dredge up found during the thermal pulses phase a conservative estimate .",
    "the mass loss rate during the agb evolution was modelled according to @xcite .",
    "based on hydrodynamic computations by @xcite , the strong increase in the mass loss rate during the agb evolution is modelled by multiplying the reimers rate by a given power of the luminosity ; the resulting expression is ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a free parameter and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the stellar mass , radius and luminosity , expressed in solar units .",
    "using as a calibration the luminosity function of lithium  rich stars in the magellanic clouds , we set @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the blcker treatment has been used and tested so far to describe mass loss from high  luminosity , m stars ; here we extend this modelling to the c  rich regime , being aware of the additional uncertainties due to this choice on the results obtained .",
    "@xcite present an analysis of the uncertainties in the description of the mass loss during the agb phase of carbon stars ( see in particular their fig .",
    "some sequences based on the @xcite treatment ( hereinafter vw93 ) were also calculated for comparison : in this case mass loss increases exponentially with the pulsation period , p , until the star enters a super  wind phase , when p exceeds 500d .",
    "the super  wind rate is @xmath21m@xmath22/yr .    the results provided by the two descriptions are in reasonable agreement for low  mass agbs , and for the early agb phases of the more massive objects ; the main differences are found in the description of the advanced phases of the evolution of the stars with mass close to the limit for carbon ignition , where the @xcite treatment predicts very large mass loss rates , that favour an earlier consumption of the whole stellar envelope .",
    "the nuclear network includes 30 elements , with 64 reactions .",
    "all the most relevant p  capture and @xmath23capture processes are taken into account .",
    "the nuclear cross - sections were taken from the nacre compilation @xcite , with the exception of the reactions @xmath24n(p,@xmath25o @xcite , @xmath26c(@xmath27o @xcite , @xmath28c+@xmath29 @xcite , @xmath30ne(p,@xmath31na @xcite , @xmath32na(p,@xmath33 mg @xcite , @xmath32na(p,@xmath34ne @xcite .",
    "the opacities in the low - temperature regime are calculated by means of the aesopus tool , developed by @xcite .",
    "these tables are suitably constructed to follow the changes in the chemical composition of the envelope when the c / o ratio approaches , or exceeds , unity .",
    "this is deeply different from the classic approach , traditionally used to build agb models , that neglects possible variations in the surface chemistry during the evolution in the opacity calculations . to understand how the results depend on this choice",
    ", we decided to calculate additional agb models , where the above effect is neglected .",
    "it goes without saying that this is expeted to play a role only in the models that eventually reach the c  star stage , i.e. for m@xmath35m@xmath22 in the present investigation .    for the present study ,",
    "we restrict our discussion to stellar models with absolute metallicity z=0.001 , and helium fraction y=0.24 .",
    "the mixture is @xmath23enhanced with @xmath36/fe]=+0.4 , the solar reference mixture being @xcite .",
    "other chemical compositions will be investigated in future explorations .",
    "the thermodynamic and chemical structure of the wind that forms around agbs is calculated on the basis of the inputs provided at each time step by the integration of the structure of the central star , which are the natural outcomes of the aton code .",
    "in particular , we use luminosity ( @xmath19 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath37 ) , mass ( @xmath17 ) , mass loss rate ( @xmath38 ) , and surface chemistry defined by the mass fractions ( @xmath39 ) of the various elements included in the nuclear network .",
    "the structure of the wind is determined following the schematization by @xcite .",
    "the outflow is assumed to be stationary and spherically symmetric . neglecting the hydrostatic pressure forces",

    "( [ eqt ] ) is found from the differential relation ,    @xmath51    with the limiting condition that @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "the wind model , determined via integration of eqs .",
    "( [ eqv])([eqtau ] ) , is calculated starting from the innermost radius where the first dust species become stable , commonly located 34 stellar radii away from the centre of the star .",
    "this is expected to coincide with the region where @xmath41 increases until it exceeds unity , and the wind is accelerated to supersonic velocities . in analogy with @xcite , we keep the velocity of the gas constant from the surface of the star to the region where dust forms .",
    "the above equations are integrated out to a radial distance of @xmath54 ( @xmath18 is the stellar radius ) , far beyond the point where all the relevant quantities reach their asymptotic behaviour .    before turning to the dust formation process",
    ", we stress here that a more physically sound description of the wind properties is needed before the full reliability of the results from this kind of investigations can be confirmed .",
    "in particular , the assumption of a time  independent flow neglects any effect of atmospheric shocks waves , which play a crucial role for the wind mechanism .",
    "the assumption of a constant velocity does not account for the consequences of these shocks , which could push the gas beyond the condensation point .      dust formation generally starts with the condensation of small seed nuclei which then grow by accreting material to macroscopic grains .",
    "since the nature of these seeds is still unclear , we do not consider the nucleation phase , but only the growth process of grains . as initial conditions , in agreement with @xcite , we assume that the seed grains have an initial size @xmath55 nm , and that their initial density is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the hydrogen number density in the wind",
    ". we could verify that the results are independent of both assumptions .",
    "the composition of dust in the winds during the agb phase depends on the surface chemical composition .",
    "for m stars , with surface c / o @xmath58 1 , the dominant dust species are expected to be olivine , pyroxene , quartz , and solid iron . for c stars with surface c / o @xmath59",
    ", the dust mixture is assumed to be dominated by solid carbon , sic and solid iron . in table 1",
    "we summarize the formation reactions of these dust species . when computing the reaction rates for olivine and pyroxene , we follow the variation of the magnesium percentage with respect to the pure iron component .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the mass loss description has important effects on dust formation around agbs .",
    "in fact , the surface chemistry of the star , which determines the composition of dust species , results from the interplay among tdu , hbb , and the consumption rate of the envelope . this is particularly important for massive agbs and sagbs , because the degree of the p  capture nucleosynthesis experienced at the base of the convective zone , hence the final elemental abundances , depends on the mass left in the envelope at each evolutionary stage .",
    "therefore , a major issue is the competition between the rates of the relevant nuclear reactions and the time ",
    "scale for envelope consumption . in the reference aton model",
    ", the mass loss treatment follows the prescription by @xcite . to quantify the uncertainties introduced by the mass loss treatment we have explored models where the @xcite prescription is used .    the evolution of the @xmath5 model presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is characterized by an early phase of strong silicates production , followed by a later stage , during which only solid iron forms .",
    "when silicates production ceases , the mass left on the envelope depends on the ratio between the rate of oxygen burning at the bottom of the external mantle and the rate of envelope ejection : a smaller @xmath38 renders this behaviour even more extreme , because it increases the fraction of silicates  free mass lost by the star .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figmdot ] .",
    "the left panel shows the variations of the surface content of oxygen and carbon when the @xcite ( solid lines ) and the @xcite ( dotted lines ) mass loss treatments are used . in both models ,",
    "an initial phase of carbon burning occurs , followed by the depletion of surface oxygen .",
    "the @xcite mass loss is so strong that oxygen burning proceeds at the same rate as surface mantle consumption .",
    "since the @xcite mass loss rate is much slower , the star experiences many more tps , and eventually tdu , via an increase in the surface @xmath26c , favours the formation of a carbon star . however , carbon dust production is negligible because surface carbon enrichment is inhibited by hbb . for the @xmath5 stellar mass model ,",
    "the mass lost by the star when it is still o  rich is @xmath60 , to be compared to @xmath61 in the @xcite model . as it is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figmdot ] , the production of silicates is consequently smaller and iron is the only dust species produced for most of the evolution . as a result , the lower mass loss rate leads to a reduction of the total dust mass produced by @xmath62 dex .",
    "dust formation is progressively less affected by the mass loss description as the mass of the star decreases , because stars of smaller mass never enter the phase when only iron is produced , thus the production of silicates never ceases .    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : lowtopacities ] , mass loss also plays a role in setting the stellar mass , which marks the border between silicates producers and carbon  dust producers . with our standard choices , based on the @xcite treatment , we find this threshold mass to be @xmath63 .",
    "when the @xcite formulation is adopted , this limit shifts downwards to @xmath64 , because the larger mass left in the envelope for a given core mass favours hbb ignition .    for sagbs",
    ", @xcite showed that a mass loss rate increasing with the luminosity , as in the @xcite recipe , prevents the star from experiencing a very advanced nucleosynthesis ; on the contrary , in models based on the @xcite formulation only a modest amount of oxygen is left in the envelope for most of the sagb evolution @xcite . in this latter case",
    "the production of silicates would be smaller and limited to early evolutionary phases , whereas iron would be the main dust species produced .",
    "a detailed investigation , aimed at understanding the uncertainties affecting stardust from sagb stars , is in preparation and will be presented in a separate paper .      for each dust species",
    ", condensation occurs below a threshold temperature that depends on the differences in the formation enthalpies of the various molecules entering the reaction associated to the condensation process . below the threshold temperature ,",
    "the destruction rate rapidly declines to zero , thus leaving the production rate to depend uniquely on the growth  rate coefficients .",
    "the latter , in turn , are linearly proportional to the sticking coefficients , @xmath23 , which parametrize the efficiency of the dust formation process .    for quartz and pyroxene the sticking coefficients are poorly constrained by laboratory experiments .",
    "similarly , the exchange coefficient regulating the magnesium fraction within olivine and pyroxene is very uncertain . since for all the stellar models",
    "the surface chemical composition is extremely rich in magnesium , the latter coefficient has a negligible effect on dust formation and the equilibria of both hybrid products , olivine and pyroxene , are always shifted to the magnesium  rich cases .    to estimate the uncertainties associated to the sticking coefficients we have artificially changed by a factor 5 those relative to pyroxene and quartz ( see table 1 for the values adopted in the reference model ) .",
    "the resulting dust masses are shown in fig .",
    "[ figstick ] where dashed ( solid ) lines indicate the mass of pyroxene ( quartz ) expected when the minimum and maximum sticking coefficient is adopted . for comparison , we also show the total mass of silicates expected in the reference model ( filled squares ) and mass of olivine ( long - dashed line ) which is not affected by the uncertainty on the sticking coefficient and is the most abundant species among silicates .",
    "thus , although the pyroxene and quartz masses can vary by a factor @xmath65 , their variation has a smaller effect on the total mass of dust : this is represented by the shaded region and shows that when the lowest limits for the pyroxene and quartz sticking coefficients are used , their contribution is completely negligible compared to the olivine , causing a @xmath66 decrease in the total mass of silicates . on the other hand , with the highest sticking coefficient , pyroxene becomes the dominant species for all stellar models , and the silicates mass produced increases by a factor @xmath67 . at present , this quantifies the degree of uncertainty due to choice of the sticking coefficients on the total dust mass formed .",
    "in fig .  [ figtot ] we summarize the results of the present study of dust production by agbs and sagbs stars .",
    "we show separately the silicates ( left panel ) and carbon ( right ) dust produced by stars as a function of their initial mass .",
    "the values obtained with the reference model for the agb evolution described in sect .  [ sec : refmodel ] are indicated as filled squares .",
    "the shaded areas quantify the uncertainties introduced in dust mass estimates by the poorly understood physical processes discussed in the previous sections . these are limited to stellar masses @xmath68 because a detailed investigation of the uncertainties affecting dust production by sagbs will be presented in a future paper . for comparison ,",
    "the triangles represent the results obtained by @xcite using synthetic models of agbs with initial metallicity of @xmath7 .",
    "the extension of the shaded region in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figtot ] confirms that the mass of silicates produced by stars with @xmath69 is extremely uncertain , being very sensitive to the adopted molecular opacities whose treatment determines whether hbb can be activated . in our standard case ,",
    "models within this range of masses are precited to produce carbon  type dust , with a poor production of silicates : this explains the almost null lower limit in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figtot ] . on the other hand ,",
    "use of classic opacities , coupled with the @xcite mass loss prescription , allows hbb conditions to be reached even for @xmath70 , thus preventing the envelope of the star to become carbon  rich , and favouring the production of silicate  type dust .",
    "these assumptions , coupled with the highest choice of the sticking coefficients for the formation of pyroxene and quartz grains ( see fig",
    ".  [ figstick ] ) , determine the upper envelope of the shaded area in the low  mass regime of fig .",
    "[ figtot ] ( left panel ) .    for stars experiencing hbb ,",
    "the uncertainties on silicates production are smaller .",
    "the lower limit on the shaded regions is set by the mass loss modelling , whereas the upper limit is due to the choice of the sticking coefficients . in agreement with the discussion of the previous sections , we find that the most uncertain models are those experiencing strong hbb ( @xmath71 )",
    ".    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figtot ] shows that carbon dust production is also uncertain in the low  mass regime ( m@xmath72 ) , due to the combined effects of mass loss and opacities for carbon ",
    "rich mixtures , that are essential in determining whether hbb conditions are reached . in our reference model",
    "no carbon dust is expected for @xmath73 , whereas in models calculated with the @xcite mass loss treatment some production is expected , because the envelope is consumed so slowly that eventually tdu can lead to the c / o@xmath59 condition .",
    "this determines the extent of the shaded region associated to stars of @xmath74 in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figtot ] .    a comparison between the data marked with squares and triangles in fig .",
    "[ figtot ] shows that the dust yields based on synthetic agb models @xcite can not be reconciled with our results , even taking into account the uncertainties on the physical processes discussed so far .",
    "according to @xcite , the dominant dust species produced by stars with @xmath7 and initial stellar masses @xmath75 is carbon  dust ; the production of silicates is limited to stars with initial masses @xmath76 but amounts to a few percent of the total dust mass formed .",
    "these differences can be entirely ascribed to the adopted description of the convective transport in the innermost regions of the convective envelope . as shown by @xcite , use of the fst model leads to stronger hbb , at odds with the mlt treatment , that favours a modest hbb only in the most massive stars . in the latter case ,",
    "independently of the mass , tdu eventually dominates and the carbon  star stage is reached .",
    "it is not surprising that the results by @xcite predict the formation of c  type dust ; in our case this is possible only for models not experiencing hbb , i.e. for m@xmath72 .    in the low  mass regime",
    "the results are in qualitative agreement , the carbon  dust mass presented by @xcite being larger ; this is partly due to the different choices for the low ",
    "t molecular opacities and the mass loss description , and also the efficiency of the tdu extension , which in our case is found by neglecting any overshoot from the base of the envelope , and is thus to be considered as a conservative estimate .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the implications of the dust yields for agb and sagb stars within the context of cosmic dust enrichment .    following the analysis done by valiante et al .",

    "all the stars are assumed to form in a single burst at @xmath94 with initial metallicity of @xmath95 and the mass of dust is normalized to the total stellar mass formed .    since",
    "massive agbs and sagbs stars are the most efficient silicates producers , about @xmath96  myr after the burst silicates dominate the dust mass evolution . when stars of @xmath97 have ended their evolution , about 300 myr after the burst , the production of silicates ceases and restarts only when stars with @xmath98 reach their agb phase ( @xmath99  gyr after the burst ) .",

    "<S> although part of the modelling which describes the stellar outflow is not completely realistic , this approach allows a straight comparison with results based on similar assumptions present in the literature , and thus can be used as an indication of the uncertainties affecting the theoretical investigations focused on the dust formation process in the surroundings of agb stars .    </S>",
