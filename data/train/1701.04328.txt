    "accretion powered pulsar gx 1 + 4 was discovered in 1970 with pulsations of about two minutes period ( lewin et al . 1971 ) .",
    "it showed strong spin - up during 1970s ( white et al .",
    "after an undetectable low state era during early 1980s , the source was detected again and found to have undergone a torque reversal ( makishima et al .",
    "1988 ) . after this torque reversal event , gx",
    "1 + 4 has been usually observed to be spinning down ( gonzales - galan et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "gx 1 + 4 is in a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) system with its optical counterpart being an m6iii type red giant star v2116 oph which does not fill its roche lobe ( glass & feast 1973 ; chakrabarty & roche 1997a ; hinkle et al .",
    "distance to this system was estimated to be about 4.3 kpc ( hinkle et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "gx 1 + 4 is the first identified accretion powered pulsar in a symbiotic x - ray binary system in which the compact object accretes mass via the dense wind of the m - type giant companion ( corbet et al .",
    "presence of a long - term accretion disc around the pulsar was suggested and standard accretion disc theory ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ; wang 1987 ) was used to explain pulse period evolution , torque reversal and transition to a faint state ( dotani et al .",
    "1989 ; cui & smith 2004 ) .    magnetic field strength of gx 1 + 4 was inferred by using two ways : making use of standard accretion disc theory and using marginal evidence of cyclotron resonance scattering feature . with the standard accretion disc theory ,",
    "surface magnetic field strength of the pulsar was estimated to be quite high , being @xmath2 gauss ( dotani et al . 1989 ; cui & smith 2004 ) .",
    "on the other hand using marginal evidence of cyclotron resonance scattering feature ( crsf ) , magnetic field strength was estimated to be rather ordinary among accretion powered pulsars , being @xmath3 gauss ( rea et al . 2005 ; ferrigno et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "although optical companion of gx 1 + 4 is known , orbital parameters of the system has not been conclusively determined yet . from x - ray measurements of the spin period variations during both spin up and down era ( between 1991 and 1998 ) ,",
    "an orbital period of 304 days has been suggested ( cutler et al .",
    "1986 , pereira et al . 1999 ,",
    "braga et al . 2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , infrared observations of the source have indicated a 1161-day period without any sign of 304-day periodicity ( hinkle et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "x - ray spectrum of gx 1 + 4 was studied extensively before . both a power law with an exponential cutoff ( cui 1997 , kotani et al .",
    "1999 , cui & smith 2004 , ferrigno et al .",
    "2007 ) and a model based on comptonization of soft photons in hot plasma ( galloway 2000 , galloway et al .",
    "2000 , galloway et al .",
    "2001 , naik et al .",
    "2005 ) are found to fit the x - ray spectra well .",
    "the continuum is influenced by highly variable intrinsic absorption and strong iron line emission .",
    "gx 1 + 4 exhibits low luminosity states with irregular time coverage varying from several days to months . during these times iron emission",
    "is enhanced and the continuum is generally harder without an indication of cutoff .",
    "a bepposax observation of the gx 1 + 4 during a low luminosity state revealed a strong iron k@xmath4 emission along with the iron k@xmath5 ( rea et al . 2005 ) and a narrower iron k@xmath4 line is found to be present for moderate luminosities as well ( naik et al .",

    ", we present timing and spectral analysis of rxte  pca observations of gx 1 + 4 consisting of 90 pointing observations between march 3 , 2001 and january 31 , 2003 with a total exposure of 276 ks .",
    "moreover , we also look for episodic correlations and anti - correlations between torque and x - ray luminosity using cgro  batse x - ray flux and frequency derivative time series between 1991 and 1999 . in section [",
    "sect : obs ] , we briefly introduce the observations . in sections [ sect :",
    "timing ] and [ sect : spec ] , we present the analysis of these observations .",
    "in section [ sect : discuss ] , we discuss our results .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) was an x - ray satellite which had been launched into low - earth orbit on december 30 , 1995 and operated until january 5 , 2012 .",
    "it had proportional counter array ( pca ) which were composed of proportional counter units ( pcus ) , each of which had an effective area of 1300 @xmath6 .",
    "the pca was sensitive to the photons within 260 kev energy range .",
    "gx 1 + 4 was monitored with rxte  pca between march 3 , 2001 and january 31 , 2003 . during this time interval ,",
    "90 pointing observations were carried out .",
    "total exposure of these observations is around 276 ks while the exposure for each observation varies between 0.5 and 18 ks ( see table [ tab : obslog ] for details ) .",
    ".observation log of gx 1 + 4 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     in contrast to previous studies that concentrates on searching for `` general '' correlation or anti - correlation states ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "1997b ; paul et al .",
    "1997 ; gonzales - golan et al .",
    "2012 ) , we searched for episodic correlations and anti - correlations on shorter time scales ( @xmath0100 - 200 day long ) by using cgro - batse measurements .",
    "we find that the correlation state of gx 1 + 4 seems to change on @xmath0 100 - 200 days long intervals ( see figure [ fig : pearson ] ) .",
    "furthermore , these correlation and anti - correlation intervals do not show significant x - ray flux changes compared to uncorrelated intervals .",
    "still , we might argue that these correlation and anti - correlation intervals might be indications of transient accretion disc formation ( either prograde or retrograde ) and episodic variation of accretion geometry without significant x - ray flux variations .",
    "future monitoring observations of gx 1 + 4 will be useful to further understand the torque @xmath7 x - ray luminosity relation .",
    "torque noise fluctuations and noise strengths of pulse frequency fluctuations have been studied for several accretion powered x - ray pulsars ( bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ; baykal & gelman 1993 ) .",
    "red noise ( random walk ) in pulse frequency fluctuations or white noise in the pulse frequency derivatives are resonable models for wind accreting x - ray binaries like vela x-1 , 4u 1538 - 52 and gx 301 - 2 ( bildsten et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "these sources have power spectra with white noise strengths in the range @xmath8 hz s@xmath9 .",
    "the persistent long - term spinning - down source 4u 1907 + 09 ( baykal et al . 2001 , baykal 2006 ) also shows random walk in the pulse frequency history ( ahiner et al .",
    "2012 ) with noise strength @xmath10",
    "hz s@xmath9 for a frequency interval between 1/1300 d@xmath11 and 1/75 d@xmath11 . for this source ,",
    "formation of an episodic transient accretion disc around the neutron star was suggested to explain the random walk model in pulse frequency ( ahiner et al .",
    "2012 ) .    being accretion powered pulsars in low mass x - ray binaries , her x-1 and 4u 1626 - 67 accrete via persistent accretion discs and their pulse frequency time series are also consistent with the random walk model .",
    "their pulse frequency derivatives have white noise strengths in the range @xmath12 to @xmath13 hz s@xmath9 .",
    "since the power spectra of these sources lie in a narrow range , possibility of red noise in the pulse frequency derivative can not be excluded ( bildsten et al . 1997 ) .",
    "cen x-3 accretes via disc and and the noise strength varies from low to high frequencies as @xmath14 , @xmath13 hz s@xmath9 ( bildsten et al .",
    "1997).the power law index of the power spectrum in this system is @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that disc accretion dominates at short time scales .",
    "oao 1657 - 415 has a power law index of @xmath16 with noise strength @xmath17",
    "hz s@xmath9 ( baykal 1997 ) .",
    "this source also shows marginal correlation with spin - down rate and x - ray luminosity ( baykal 2000 ) .",
    "x per has the lowest noise strength among accretion powered pulsars in high mass x - ray binaries with @xmath18 hz s@xmath9 for frequencies between 1yr@xmath11 and 1/35 yr@xmath11 ( acuner et al .",
    "2014 ) . the steep power law index in pulse frequency derivative indicates that it could have a transient accretion disc .",
    "sax j2103.5 + 4545 has the steepest power law index with 2.13 among high mass x - ray binaries ( baykal et al .",
    "the steep power law index suggests that accretion via accretion disc at shorter time scales possesses low timing noise therefore power density spectrum becomes more steeper compared to the other persistent high mass x - ray binaries .",
    "in gx 1 + 4 , we observe flickering noise ( @xmath1 ) which agrees with the power spectrum estimate of bildsten et al .",
    "it is important to note that we extend the estimate for a time scale ranging from 31 days to 44 years .",
    "thus , we achieve to measure the longest observed timescale for a noise process among accretion powered x - ray pulsars .",
    "we find that the noise strength level of the source changes between @xmath19hz sec@xmath9 and @xmath20hz sec@xmath9 .",
    "we also investigate x - ray energy spectrum of the source using absorbed power law model with or without cut - off , including a gaussian line for iron line complex .",
    "analysis of time resolved spectra by using individual rxte - pca observations indicate a significant correlation between iron line flux and unabsorbed x - ray flux",
    ". this correlation might be an indication of the fact that flourescent iron line emission originates from the reflected x - rays and corresponding reflected flux should be proportional to the x - ray flux of the source .",
    "we also combine rxte - pca observations to obtain four overall x - ray spectra with the data having exposure times of 18.66ks , 14.69ks , 26.77ks and 21.33ks . for these spectra two different models",
    "are used for fitting : an absorbed power law with a high energy cut - off and an absorbed model based on comptonization of soft photons in hot plasma .",
    "it is found that both models are equally successful to describe these four energy spectra in general , however resulting hydrogen column density values corresponding to these models are significantly different from each other .",
    "pulse phase resolved spectra of the source are also successfully modeled using both models . from the powerlaw fits , the spectral bin corresponding to the pulse minimum has significantly higher cutoff energy , lower photon index and lower e - folding energy indicating a harder spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "if the comptonization model is considered , our result is in agreement with that of galloway et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : decrease in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and increase in @xmath23 for the pulse minimum .",
    "this behaviour might be an indication of an accretion column eclipse during pulse minima .",
