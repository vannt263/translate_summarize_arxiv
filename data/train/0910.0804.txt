    "in supergravity ( sugra ) models , both neutralinos and gravitinos are plagued by the gravitino problem .",
    "thermally - produced gravitinos @xmath5 too weakly coupled to be in thermal equilibrium can decay into various sparticle - particle pairs with long lifetimes of order @xmath6-@xmath7 seconds due to the planck mass suppression of the gravitino coupling constant : @xmath8 . the energy injection during or after bbn from these late - decaying gravitinos can dis - associate light element nuclei created during bbn , thereby disrupting the successful predictions of the light element abundances calculated from nuclear thermodynamics .",
    "one way to avoid over - production of gravitinos in the early universe , and thus bypass the gravitino problem , is to require @xmath9 gev for @xmath10 tev .",
    "however , such low values of @xmath0 rule out many attractive baryogenesis mechanisms , so we instead relax the upper bound to @xmath11 gev by allowing @xmath12 tev .",
    "as long as we keep @xmath0 below the upper bound , we can still avoid the gravitino problem .",
    "the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe provides us with an additional cosmological constraint . in light of evidence for massive neutrinos ,",
    "the currently popular mechanism for baryogensis is leptogenesis . in thermal leptogenesis ,",
    "heavy right - handed neutrino states @xmath13 ( @xmath14 - 3 is a generation index ) decay asymmetrically to leptons over anti - leptons in the early universe . the lepton asymmetry is converted to baryon asymmetry via sphaleron effects .",
    "the measured baryon abundance can be met for @xmath15 gev  @xcite subjecting this mechanism to the gravitino problem described above .",
    "if we instead turn to non - thermal leptogenesis , where the @xmath13 states may be produced via inflaton decays , then we can achieve lower reheat temperatures .",
    "the boltzmann equations for the @xmath16-@xmath17 asymmetry ( which is again converted into baryon asymmetry by sphaleron processes ) have been solved numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite , within which the baryon - to - entropy ratio is found to be @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the heaviest ( active ) neutrino mass , @xmath20 is the mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino , and @xmath21 is an effective @xmath22-violating phase .",
    "comparing this to the wmap value of @xmath23  @xcite constrains the lower bound on the reheat temperature to @xmath24 gev . a third type known as affleck - dine leptogenesis",
    "is described succinctly in ref .",
    "the baryon - to - entropy ratio for affleck - dine can be expressed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the higgs field vev , @xmath27 is the mass of the lightest neutrino , and @xmath28 is the planck scale . from this relation , values of @xmath29-@xmath30 gev are allowed for @xmath31-@xmath32 ev .",

    ". then the axion field @xmath35 can start with any value on the order of the peccei - quinn ( pq ) breaking scale at temperatures @xmath36 . as the temperature of the universe drops , the potential turns on causing @xmath35 to oscillate and settle to its minimum at @xmath37 ( here @xmath38 $ ]",

    "the difference between @xmath35 before and after the potential turns on corresponds to the vacuum misalignment producing an axion number density @xmath41 where _ t _ is the time near the qcd phase transition .",
    "relating the number density to the entropy density yields a formula for the axion relic density today  @xcite : @xmath42 axions produced from vacuum misalignment constitute _ cold _ dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "axinos can be produced thermally or non - thermally .",
    "if the axino @xmath43 is the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , then the neutralino can decay via @xmath44 .",
    "the axinos inherit the thermally produced neutralino number density .",
    "thus , the non - thermal production ( ntp ) relic abundance of axinos is @xmath45 ntp axinos are _ warm _ dark matter for @xmath46 - 10 gev  @xcite .",
    "the neutralino - to - axino decay can reduce relic density by large factors , thereby reinstating models that otherwise yield too much dark matter .",
    "axinos can be thermally produced via scattering and decay processes in the cosmic soup so that they need not be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "using hard thermal loop resummation , the axino thermally produced ( tp ) relic abundance is given in ref .",
