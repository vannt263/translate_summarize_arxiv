    "faraday tomography , originally suggested by @xcite and @xcite , introduced a revolutionary progress in the study of cosmic magnetic field , superseded by that using faraday rotation measure ( rm ) .",
    "the technique creates a tomographic reconstruction of polarization spectrum as a function of rm or the faraday depth along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "the basic equation is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the observed polarization spectrum . here , @xmath3 is the faraday spectrum or faraday dispersion function ( fdf ) , which is basically the polarized synchrotron emission due to the `` perpendicular '' magnetic field , @xmath4 , as a function of the faraday depth , @xmath5 .",
    "the faraday depth is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the `` parallel '' magnetic field , @xmath8 is the thermal electron density , and @xmath9 is the physical distance along the los . it is given in units of @xmath10 .",
    "the coefficient is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the electron charge , @xmath13 is the electron mass , and @xmath14 is the speed of light .",
    "the study of magnetic field using faraday tomography involves two stages of efforts .",
    "one is the reconstruction of @xmath3 , and the other is the extraction of the magnetic field information from @xmath3 .",
    "the first requires wide frequency coverage observations of @xmath2 , which can be provided by , for instance , the square kilometre array ( ska ) and its pathfinders and precursors , such as , lofar , askap , meerkat , mwa , and hera .",
    "various approaches for it have been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the second requires a successful interpretation of @xmath3 .",
    "but that often turns out to be difficult , because the physical distance is not in one - to - one correspondence with the faraday depth owing to the turbulent component of magnetic field , and thus @xmath3 , in general , does not represent the distribution of polarized emission in the real space . while it would be straightforward to estimate , for instance , the number of sources of synchrotron radiation and their faraday depths , the faraday spectrum should contain more information .",
    "there have been relatively few works of how to retrieve such information ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the the second stage efforts . as the first trial",
    ", we consider face - on spiral galaxies and study how the properties of the `` vertical '' magnetic field ( the component vertical to the disk ) can be extracted .",
    "the strength of vertical magnetic field is among many yet to be constrained in spiral galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a summary ) .",
    "it has been observed in several edge - on galaxies showing the x - shaped pattern ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but such observations so far have told us mostly the existence and orientation of the field .",
    "the vertical magnetic field is important for the reconstruction of the global galactic magnetic field and its origin @xcite , and also necessary to describe the cosmic - ray ( cr ) transportation ( galactic wind ) . in the milky way",
    ", there is a difference in the strength of vertical magnetic field toward the north and south galactic poles , as estimated with rm @xcite .",
    "this is inconsistent with observations of several external galaxies and needs to be understood @xcite .",
    "the strategy of our study is following .",
    "we assume models for spiral galaxies and magnetic fields there , and calculate @xmath3 by changing model parameters .",
    "we then examine the dependence of @xmath3 on parameters .",
    "previously @xcite studied @xmath3 of face - on galaxies , using a model for the milky way @xcite .",
    "the model includes the global , regular component of magnetic field , based on observations , as well as the turbulent component , constructed with the data of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations .",
    "@xmath3 turned out to be very complicated , mostly due to the turbulent component of magnetic field .",
    "we attempted to extract the magnetic field information using the shape - characterizing parameters of @xmath3 , that is , the width , skewness , and kurtosis , @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath16-th discretized bin of faraday depth . here , @xmath17 is the spectrum - weighted average of faraday depth .",
    "we found that stronger vertical magnetic fields result in larger @xmath18 ; hence , @xmath18 should be a useful measure . on the other hand , @xmath19 and @xmath20 exhibit complicated behaviors .",
    "@xmath3 in the work was obtained with a realistic model , but its characteristics were not easy to be understood . a simpler approach would be desired for a better understanding of the characteristics of @xmath3 .",
    "after the previous work , we here assume much a simpler , toy model for the magnetic field in face - on spiral galaxies , and numerically and analytically calculate @xmath3 and its shape - characterizing parameters .",
    "the turbulent magnetic field is modeled as a random field with single coherence length , and the resulting @xmath3 is examined . the turbulent field represented by power - law spectra",
    "is also considered .",
    "we specifically examine how @xmath3 obtained along `` multiple loss '' can be used to explore the vertical magnetic field .",
    "we regard this work as the first step in finding a practical way to extract magnetic field the information from faraday spectrum . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we describe the toy model and show calculated @xmath3 . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we present the analytical interpretation of calculated @xmath3 . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we present @xmath3 with power - law magnetic fields .",
    "summary and discussion follow in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "note that in this paper , we concentrate on the characteristics of @xmath3 , and do not consider observational effects in constructing @xmath3 from @xmath2 , such as , the ambiguity caused by the limited coverage of observation frequency and observational noises .",
    "cccc @xmath21 & random component of @xmath7 & @xmath22 g & @xcite + @xmath23 & coherent component of @xmath7 & @xmath24 @xmath25 g & @xcite + @xmath8 & thermal electron density & 0.02 @xmath26 & @xcite + @xmath27 & cell size & * 10 * , 50 , 100 pc & @xcite + @xmath28 & scale height of physical quantities & 0.5 , * 1.0 * , 2.0 kpc & @xcite +    we consider a small portion of face - on spiral galaxies , and employ a simple model for the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field is decomposed into the parallel ( @xmath29 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath30 ) components with respect to the los ; @xmath29 contributes to the faraday depth , while @xmath30 to the polarized synchrotron emission , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we further assume that the parallel field is decomposed into the random and coherent components , representing the turbulent and global vertical fields , respectively , and express it as , @xmath31    @xcite , for instance , estimated that the strength of the turbulent magnetic field in our galaxy is of order @xmath32 g from a study of galactic synchrotron emission .",
    "so we set the rms ( root - mea - square ) strength of @xmath21 , @xmath33 , to be @xmath34 g ( then the rms strength of three - dimensional ( 3d ) random field is 1 @xmath25 g ) .",
    "it was shown that the size of turbulent cells in the galactic disk is @xmath35 @xmath36 pc from a pulsar rm study @xcite , that the outer scale of turbulent magnetic field is @xmath35 17 pc in spiral arms and @xmath35 100 pc in interarm regions from an rm study of extragalactic polarized sources @xcite , and that the size of turbulent cells in external galaxies is @xmath35 50 pc from a faraday depolarization study @xcite .",
    "based on these studies , for the coherence length of random field , we adopt 10 pc as the fiducial value and also consider 50 and 100 pc for comparison . on the other hand , we take @xmath23 as a free parameter varying the value , and see the effects on faraday spectrum . from rm studies , @xcite and @xcite estimated that the strength of global vertical field is @xmath37 g and @xmath38 g toward the north galactic pole ( ngp ) and the south galactic pole ( sgp ) , respectively .",
    "so we set @xmath39 g .    as to the perpendicular magnetic field that lies on galactic disks , we assume that the coherent component dominates the random component .",
    "this assumption may be justified with observations of ordered magnetic fields in galactic disks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , for instance , reported a spiral pattern of @xmath40 from a polarized radiation observation in m51 , with an angular resolution of @xmath41 which corresponds to the beam size of @xmath35 500 pc .",
    "this means that the synchrotron emissions within this beam would have similar polarization angles .",
    "we treat @xmath30 as being uniform over the computational domain ( see below ) .",
    "this results in the same polarization angle for synchrotron radiations within the domain .",
    "thermal and cr electron densities enter in the calculations of faraday depth and synchrotron emission .",
    "observations suggest @xmath42 @xmath43 for the thermal electron density in our galaxy ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "so we adopt @xmath44 0.02 @xmath43 .",
    "we here concern only the overall shape of faraday spectrum , but not its amplitude ( see section [ sec2.2 ] ) .",
    "hence , we do not need to specify the density and energy spectrum of cr electrons , nor the strength of perpendicular magnetic field , @xmath30 .",
    "the physical quantities described above are assigned to cubic cells of size @xmath27 . for @xmath21",
    ", we randomly place @xmath45 of 1 @xmath25 g strength and take the los component .",
    "then , @xmath46 g , and the cell size corresponds to the coherence length , that is , @xmath47 10 , 50 , 100 pc .",
    "other quantities , such as @xmath23 , @xmath8 , and the synchrotron emissivity , are assumed to be simply uniform in the computational domain .    along a los , we stack up cells for @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath28 is the scale height of physical quantities .",
    "@xcite , for instance , suggested @xmath49 pc for the thermal electron density in the thick disk of our galaxy .",
    "@xcite reported that @xmath28 of radio emission , which reflects @xmath28 of cr electrons and magnetic field , is @xmath50 pc for thin disks and @xmath51 kpc for thick disks from observations of various edge - on spiral galaxies .",
    "so we set @xmath52 kpc as the fiducial value and also consider 0.5 kpc and 2  kpc for comparison .",
    "each los includes @xmath53 cells or `` layers '' ; 200 layers for representative @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "faraday spectrum is obtained with @xmath54 loss , covering a small region in the sky where the properties of physical quantities can be assumed to be uniform , but yet larger than the coherence length of turbulent magnetic field .",

    "however , observations showed that the distribution of the radio emission from spiral galaxies can be described by a two - component exponential function , for instance , with the scale heights of 300  pc and 1.8  kpc @xcite .",
    "these suggest that the halo emission may be small compared to that of disk .    finally , the work presented here is the first step in understanding the intrinsic characteristics of @xmath3 .",
    "it needs to be further sophisticated with more realistic treatments for the galactic magnetic field .",
    "in addition , when @xmath3 is obtained from the observed polarization spectrum , the ambiguity such as the false signal in rm clean @xcite as well as noises in observation need to be considered ; so it is necessary to examine how well the shape - characterizing parameters will be determined after considering such observational effects",
    ". we will leave these as future works .",
