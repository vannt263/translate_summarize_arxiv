    "chaotic behaviour as an exponential sensitivity to initial conditions in a classical non - linear system has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "the deterministic chaos , which occurs in non - dissipative systems , can typically be found starting from regular states as a function of some external control parameter . on the other hand",
    ", there seems to be no direct analogue to chaos in the quantum world , because the schrdinger equation is linear in time , and the scalar product between different initial states ( as a measure of distance ) is conserved under unitary evolution .",
    "accordingly , the semiclassical _ quantum chaology _ @xcite has been constrained to studying some quantum - mechanical `` fingerprints of chaos '' ( like spectral properties ) , and non - trivial transitions from the quantum - to classical domain and vice versa ( e.g. , bohr s correspondence principle ) .",
    "experimental progress in mesoscopic physics , e.g. the transport of electrons through so - called `` chaotic quantum dots '' @xcite , has allowed to study a quantum - mechanical system in a random potential , the results of which give numerical evidence for weak chaos ( indicated by level repulsion ) @xcite . + recent theoretical and experimental studies in quantum information theory and quantum computation  ( qc ) @xcite should shed new light also on the basic understanding of quantum mechanics itself . in",
    "qc one tries to utilize the quantum - mechanical superposition and ( non - classical ) entanglement to solve certain classes of problems in a potentially very powerful way .",
    "while most models of qc have been based on networks of quantum gates , which are reminiscent of classical integrated circuits , quantum turing machines  ( qtm ) @xcite follow a different line but have not shown much potential for future applications up to now . in both cases the complexity of the computation is characterized by sequences of unitary transformations ( or the corresponding hamiltonians  @xmath1 acting during finite time interval steps ) .",
    "+ the investigation of quantum chaos based on quantum gate networks has so far been proposed e.g. by an implementation of quantum baker s map on a 3-qubit nmr quantum computer @xcite , or by realizing a quantum - mechanical delta - kicked harmonic oscillator in an ion trap @xcite . in both cases",
    "some sort of sensitivity has been located with respect to parameters specifying the dynamics ( e.g. , the respective hamiltonian ) . in this letter",
    "we address an iterative map which , though based on standard gates , can be thought to be realizedas a qtm architecture : local transformations of the turing head controlled by a fibonacci - like sequence of rotation angles alternate with a quantum - controlled not - operation with a second spin on the turing tape .",
    "this type of control can generate a chaotic quantum propagation ( lyapunov exponent , @xmath2 ) in the `` classical '' regime @xcite which is defined here as the turing head being restricted to an entanglement - free state sequence ( `` primitive '' )  @xcite",
    ". it will be shown that chaos in local bloch - vector space of the turing head can be found also in the quantum - mechanical superposition of those primitives , implying entanglement between head and tape as a genuine quantum feature ( see fig  [ qtm_chaos ] ) . due to this quantum correlation",
    ", we can observe a chaotic propagation even in the reduced subspace of the turing tape ( `` chaos swapping '' ) .",
    "the quantum network  @xcite to be considered in detail is composed of 2 spins @xmath3 ( turing - head @xmath4 , turing - tape spin 1 ) so that its network - state @xmath5 lives in the 4-dimensional hilbert - space spanned by the product wave - functions @xmath6 .",
    "correspondingly , any ( unitary)network - operator can be expanded as a sum of product - operators , which may be based on the @xmath7-generators , pauli matrices @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . + the initial state @xmath10 will be taken to be a product of the turing - head and tape wave - functions .",
    "for the discretized dynamical description of this externally driven system we identify the unitary operators @xmath11 with the local unitary transformation on the turing - head @xmath4 , @xmath12 , and the quantum - controlled - not ( qcnot ) on ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 , respectively as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a ( local ) projection operator . the @xmath19th fibonacci number @xmath0 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "it is useful for later calculations to note that @xmath22 .",
    "+ we restrict ourselves to the reduced state - space dynamics of the head  @xmath4 and tape - spin  @xmath23 , respectively , @xmath24 due to the entanglement between the head and tape , both will , in general , appear to be in a `` mixed - state '' , which means that the length of the bloch - vectors in ( [ bloch ] ) is less than @xmath23 .",
    "however , for specific initial states @xmath25 the state of head and tape will remain pure : as @xmath26 with latexmath:[$\\hat{\\sigma}_{1}^{(1 ) }     @xmath14 can not create any entanglement , irrespective of the head state @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 and the turing - head then performs a pure - state trajectory ( `` primitive '' ) on the bloch - circle @xmath30 @xmath31 it is easy to verify that the fibonacci relation and the property ( [ entangle ] ) give for @xmath32 @xmath33 of @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and for @xmath37 , @xmath38 . in order to find the corresponding expression of @xmath39 for @xmath40 , we utilize the following recursion relations for the cumulative rotation angle @xmath41 up to step @xmath42 @xmath43 then @xmath44 are rewritten , respectively , as @xmath45 yielding @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "the fibonacci property implies that @xmath48 is also chaotically driven as @xmath49 is .",
    "+ from any initial state @xmath50 , we then find at step @xmath42 @xmath51 , @xmath52 this trajectory of the turing - head  @xmath4 thus appears , for fixed  @xmath42 , as a decomposition into two bloch - vectors corresponding to non - orthogonal pure states , a consequence of the superposition as a quantum feature . by using ( [ cumulative ] ) , ( [ super ] ) @xmath53 we thus obtain for @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the equation  ( [ chaotic_driving ] ) shows that the local dynamics of the turing head is controlled by a `` chaotic '' driving force ( `` input '' ) , because the sequences in @xmath58 and @xmath59 , namely @xmath60 or @xmath61 , are in fact both chaotic as @xmath62 is .",
    "the bloch - vector @xmath63 can alternatively be calculated directly from the initial state ( here : @xmath64 ) and for any control angle @xmath65 by using the relations @xmath66",
    "now we show that the periodic orbits on the plane @xmath67 are unstable , which means that the dynamics of the turing head ( `` output '' ) is indeed chaotic .",
    "it is enough to check the periodicity only for step @xmath68 : periodic orbits for @xmath69 must obey @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( mod @xmath72 ) ( one concludes that @xmath65 must be a rational multiple of @xmath73 ) . by using the fibonacci numbers ( [ fibonacci ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath74 in ( [ plus_fibo ] ) and @xmath75 in ( [ cumulative ] ) , respectively , for period @xmath76 as @xmath77 now let us consider a small perturbation @xmath78 of the initial phase angle @xmath17 , implying @xmath79 and a perturbed fibonacci - like sequence @xmath80 : @xmath81 similarly to ( [ plus_po ] ) , one finds @xmath82 , respectively , where @xmath83 by using ( [ pm_per ] ) for @xmath69 we represent the evolution of the perturbation at the @xmath84-th step : @xmath85 where @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "one easily shows @xmath89 which means that @xmath90 grows exponentially ( note that latexmath:[$|\\beta| > 1 ,     perturbation @xmath78 in the external control @xmath92 .",
    "+ strikingly enough , the local dynamics of the turing tape also shows the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath93 : @xmath94 + 1}\\ , -\\ , \\alpha_1\\ , + \\ ,   \\delta_{\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right]}^{\\mbox{fib}}\\right)&\\;\\;\\;\\;n=0,1\\ ; ( \\mbox{mod}\\ ; 4)\\\\ & \\\\ \\cos\\left(\\alpha_{\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right]+1}\\ , + \\ ,   \\delta_{\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right]}^{\\mbox{fib}}\\right)&\\;\\;\\;\\;n=2,3\\ ; ( \\mbox{mod}\\ ; 4)\\ , , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath95 : = n,\\,a = n + r,\\,n \\in \\mathbf{z},\\ , 0 \\leq r < 1 $ ] . similarly to the turing - head case , it follows for @xmath96 at step @xmath97 , period @xmath98 ( mod @xmath99 ) @xmath100 where @xmath101 , confirming the exponential instability of the periodic orbit ; it is easily shown that there is no periodic orbit with period @xmath102 ( mod@xmath99 ) .",
    "note that the turing tape can exhibit chaos only by means of the entanglement with the head ( `` chaos swapping '' ) , not as a result of a chaotic driving force .",
    "the chaotic sequence of fibonacci - type can be interpreted as temporal random ( chaotic ) `` potential '' , in analogy to @xmath23-dimensional `` chaotic quantum dots '' in real space @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to compare this machine with a regular qtm @xcite which is controlled by a fixed @xmath103 for local transformations of the turing - head by using the bures metric @xcite : @xmath104 this distance between density matrices , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , lies , independent of the dimension of the liouville space , between 0 and 2 [ see fig  [ 2figs ] ; the maximum ( squared ) distance of 2 applies to pure orthogonal states , @xmath107 . for @xmath108 and any @xmath78",
    "the distance remains constant ; for the fibonacci - like sequence we recognize an initial exponential sensitivity , which is eventually constrained , though , by @xmath109 .",
    "+ the source of the considered chaotic behaviour can be traced back to any small perturbation @xmath78 of the initial state @xmath110 which is directly connected with a perturbed unitary evolution , @xmath111 .",
    "this implies that the scalar product between different initial states ( as a measure of distance ) is no longer conserved under these evolutions : @xmath112 thus the initial state is directly correlated to its unitary evolution , which can lead to the exponential sensitivity to initial condition , whereas there is no chaos in a generic quantum system evolving by a fixed @xmath113 even if characterized by chaotic input parameters .",
    "this @xmath114 reminds us immediately of the test function @xmath115 in the control ( see also the comment by r.  schack @xcite ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the quantum dynamics of a chaotically driven qtm based on a decoherence - free hamiltonian . we have found quantum chaos as a dynamical feature and cumulative loss of control in a pure quantum regime .",
    "this might be contrasted with the usual quantum chaology , which is concerned essentially with quantal spectrum analysis of classically chaotic systems @xmath116 . as quantum features we utilized the superposition principle and the physics of entanglement .",
    "our dynamical chaos occurs as a result of the superposition and entanglement of a pair of `` classical '' ( i.e. unentangled ) chaotic state - sequences . due to the entanglement",
    ", we can observe the chaos in any local bloch - plane .",
    "this indicates that patterns in reduced bloch - spheres ( a quantum version of a poincar - cut , fig  [ stability ] ) should be useful to characterize quantum chaos in a broad class of quantum networks .",
    "it is worth noting that this kind of control loss is completely different from the typical control limit of a quantum network resulting from the exponential blow - up of hilbert - space dimension in which the state evolves @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that a qtm architecture with an arbitrary number of spins on the turing tape would also exhibit chaos under the same type of driving .",
