    "the intensity of the infrared extragalactic background light ( ebl ) is a cornerstone of cosmological observations , a measure of the total radiation produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and gravitational accretion over cosmic history .",
    "accurate measurements can determine if the ebl is consistent with the calculated surface brightness from galaxy counts , or if an additional background component is present , e.g. , unaccounted flux from known galaxies or missing galaxy populations .",
    "furthermore , light from the epoch of reionization must contribute to the total ebl , with lyman cutoff and lyman-@xmath0 features originating at @xmath1 redshifted into the near - infrared ( nir ) wavelength band .",
    "current direct measurements of the nir ebl intensity are mutually inconsistent .",
    "the dominant factor causing this discrepancy arises not from instrumental effects , but from different approaches to astrophysical foreground removal . in the nir ,",
    "all astronomical observations taken 1  au from the sun are completely dominated by zodiacal light ( zl ) .",
    "zl originates from interplanetary dust scattering sunlight at optical and near - infrared wavelengths , and emitting thermal radiation at mid - infrared to far - infrared wavelengths . in the early 1990 s , the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) produced absolute measurements of the astrophysical sky brightness in multiple bands over a wide range of solar elongation angles @xcite",
    "a model of zl based on morphology derived from annual modulation of the signal measured by dirbe was developed for subtracting the zl foreground in order to assess the ebl @xcite . applying this model has led to high ebl estimates @xcite .",
    "zodiacal dust models based on morphology alone are not unique , and a separate zl model was subsequently developed based on the assumption that the mid - infrared sky brightness observed by dirbe is entirely due to zl @xcite .",
    "implementing this foreground treatment led to a significant decrease in estimated ebl levels @xcite .",
    "@xcite make the important observation that a 23% underestimate in zl intensity in the @xcite model would account for the entire observed nir ebl excess , as the residual ebl spectrum displays the same color as zl within the statistical uncertainties .",
    "an independent test of the zl contribution to total sky brightness is needed .",
    "solar fraunhofer lines scattered by interplanetary dust provide an alternative method of estimating zl brightness . as the equivalent widths of fraunhofer lines are accurately known in the solar spectrum , a measurement of the line in scattered light is directly related to the zl continuum brightness .",
    "empirically , the measured equivalent width of fraunhofer lines in zl matches the solar spectrum to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "early measurements by @xcite were the first to estimate zl from its fraunhofer signature .",
    "@xcite attempted to measure the optical ebl using a combination of absolute sky brightness measurements with the hubble space telescope and fraunhofer line measurements with a ground - based telescope .",
    "this pioneering measurement was complicated by atmospheric airglow emission , but also by systematic uncertainties from atmospheric scattering , ground scattering , and stray light @xcite . @xcite",
    "have developed a technique to remove zl by measuring the difference in brightness between a high - latitude dark nebula and its surrounding area , using fraunhofer line measurements to remove diffuse galactic light from starlight scattered by interstellar dust .",
    "they have applied this technique to estimate the ebl at 400  nm and provide an upper limit at 520  nm . a recent re - analysis of pioneer 10 and 11 optical data at 440  nm and 640  nm from outside the zodiacal cloud",
    "@xcite also derive an ebl that is consistent with @xcite .",
    "these measurements , done with a model - independent zl foreground estimation , suggest a total ebl consistent with the integrated light from galaxies in the optical .    in this paper , we describe the design and implementation of a narrow band spectrometer ( nbs ) aboard the cosmic infrared background experiment ( ciber ) sounding rocket payload ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the instrument is optimized to measure zl intensity by observing a single fraunhofer line at 854.2 nm caused by solar absorption , and work in synergy with a low - resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to estimate the mean intensity of the ebl in the nir .",
    "the lrs will measure the spectrum of the zl ( e.g. @xcite ) from 0.75 to @xmath3 m so that a determination of the zl brightness at @xmath4 nm can be directly compared with predictions from zl models based on the dirbe 1.25 and @xmath5 m bands , where the ebl discrepancies are the largest .",
    "the ciber payload also contains two wide field imaging camera @xcite , designed to probe the ebl through its spatial fluctuation characteristics .",
    "we have chosen to measure the 854.2 nm line , the strongest of the triplet lines at 849.8 , 854.2 and @xmath6 nm . we selected a long - wavelength fraunhofer line for comparison with the dirbe / kelsall model at 1.25 and @xmath5 m , and the @xmath4 nm line is the brightest non - hydrogenic fraunhofer line , with an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath7 nm @xcite , at wavelengths longer than @xmath8 nm .",
    "we avoided hydrogen lines , which have a contribution from recombination line emission from the interstellar warm ionized medium @xcite .",

    "if the noise on detector current scales as the number of pixels @xmath28 on and off the line , the zl sensitivity is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the per pixel current noise .",
    "thus to optimize surface brightness sensitivity , we need to maximize the pixel throughput @xmath13 , and incorporate as many pixels on and off the line as possible .",

    "our chosen set point of @xmath137k , it typically takes @xmath138h for the heaters to raise the temperature of the focal plane to its set point @xmath139k above the base . when stabilized , the active control proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) loop controls the intermediate stage about the set point .    to quantify the systematic error on zl intensity measurement induced by thermal instabilities ,",
    "dark current was measured periodically during the stabilization process .",
    "images were produced from dark data with thermal drifts ranging up to @xmath140  mk / s .",
    "this drift produces a response over the array of typically @xmath141  e / s .",
    "because this response is largely spatially uniform , the effect of a thermal drift on zl signals is minimal . after subtracting a template of dark current produced by averaging",
    "many integrations taken previously with the temperature fully controlled , a fraunhofer line was fit to the thermally unstable data .",
    "the inferred zl brightness was observed to depend very steeply on thermal instability , with the amplitude of the induced zl signal falling below the statistical uncertainty ( described in section [ ss : sensitivity ] ) at a drift level of @xmath142  mk / s , equivalent to @xmath143  nw m@xmath60 sr@xmath61 in table  [ tab : performance ] .",
    "when fully controlling , the average drift of the focal plane temperature is @xmath144k / s over a 50 s integration , making the effect of thermally varying dark current a negligible systematic .",
    "the nbs control system is powered on several hours before flight to ensure that the focal plane temperature has stabilized at launch . during flight",
    ", the temperature of both thermal bridges are telemetered to the ground .",
    "the flight data show no significant deviation from the ground behavior during astronomical observations in flight .",
    "figure 10 of @xcite shows that the thermal drift of the nbs focal plane , at its worst during the first hundred seconds of flight , is @xmath145k / s in the first @xmath90s of astronomical data acquisition , which exceeds the specification .",
    "however , after this period of time the drift is @xmath146k / s and thermally - induced drift is negligible .      for precise measurements of the fraunhofer line brightness ,",
    "we require a high degree of out - of - band blocking of the zl continuum .",
    "the hgcdte detectors are only responsive over a 2100  nm range spanning @xmath147 nm , which defines the outer wavelength limit for potential contamination .",
    "the fact that the zl continuum peaks at optical wavelengths , and that any spectral leak is unlikely to be modulated over the field of view as the line , further reduces the systematic error from leaks .",
    "barr originally designed a single blocking filter ( ed536 ) to meet the @xmath148 blocking requirement .",
    "this filter ( ed536 ) provides an in - band transmittance of 66 % .",
    "the blocking performance in fig .",
    "[ fig : blocking ] is excellent , though limited by measurement accuracy to od@xmath149 .",
    "the on - axis blocking performance of the nbs was characterized using the tunable long wavelength laser system coupled to the integrating sphere as described in @xcite .",
    "the laser wavelength was changed to discrete values separated by @xmath150 nm over the range @xmath151 nm . at each wavelength step , we determined the response of the nbs by summing the photocurrent over the array . to remove the photocurrent arising from background light in the apparatus , we recorded ambient frames when the laser was shuttered .",
    "we differenced the laser on and shuttered data to measure the photocurrent arising from out - of - band light .",
    "we simultaneously monitored the radiance incident on the nbs using a calibrated detector viewing the integrating sphere . because the laser is capable of producing a large radiance in a narrow band , the signal to noise ratios of the measurements are large , even though the absolute response to out of band light is not",
    "the average photocurrent arising from @xmath152 light is @xmath153 e@xmath114s  / nw m@xmath60 sr@xmath61 , which is consistent with the od @xmath154 limit derived from direct filter testing .",
    "we produce an out - of - band spectral response function by interpolating the measurements over the range @xmath155 nm .    to determine if the measured out of band blocking is sufficient , we estimate the photocurrent expected in flight from zl by assuming a solar zl spectrum for @xmath156 .",
    "the expected signal at the nbs detector is then calculated by numerically integrating the product of the zl spectrum and our out - of - band response function which yields @xmath157me@xmath114s  at the ecliptic pole .",
    "this results in a calculated level of @xmath158 and is therefore is deemed negligible .      to measure the fraunhofer line intensity",
    "we must first normalize the relative responsivity of the individual detector array pixels to a common value , typically termed the `` flat field '' correction . because the flat field of the nbs detector array can not be determined independently of the astrophysical signal in flight",
    ", we must measure the flat field response in the laboratory .",
    "the internal instrument calibration lamp serves as a transfer standard to verify that the responsivity has not changed between the laboratory testing and flight .",
    "the flat field measurement consists of a quartz halogen lamp which is fiber coupled into an integrating sphere inside a vacuum chamber .",
    "we measured the output spectrum of the integrating sphere and added a filter at the lamp to synthesize a solar spectrum over the wavelength range of interest , @xmath159  nm@xmath160  nm . the ciber instrument shares a common vacuum space with the test chamber so there are no optical surfaces between the integrating sphere port and the nbs aperture . since the illumination pattern of the output of the sphere has been measured to be uniform to @xmath161 0.3% at angles of incidence @xmath162 the illumination measured at the nbs focal plane is a good tracer of the array flat field .",
    "the flat field response is measured by turning on the quartz halogen lamp , recording an image , and then subtracting images before and after the lamp is off to remove any background signal .",
    "finally these measurements are bracketed by dark frames to ensure that the array baseline behavior is stable .",
    "the flat field is measured at a variety of input flux levels from 1000 to 10 e@xmath114sto ensure the flat field measurement does not vary significantly with source brightness due to detector non - linearity .    to quantify the stability of the flat field and its effect on the instrument s ability to accurately measure the depth of the fraunhofer line",
    ", the measurement was repeated three independent times .",
    "each measurement was conducted in a separate cooldown of the cryostat . to quantify stability ,",
    "the amplitude of the fraunhofer line was fit in a direct measurement of the solar spectrum ( described in detail in section [ s : solmeas ] ) using each of the three independent flat field measurements .",

    ", we followed the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "this consisted of replacing the picnic array with a warm silicon photo - diode and mounting the nbs to a custom optical bench capable of rotation to 90@xmath170 from on - axis .",
    "a collimated halogen source was chopped at 20  hz as the angle to the nbs boresight was varied .",
    "the amplitude of the modulated signal was measured with a lock - in amplifier referenced to the signal from the chopper .",
    "the dynamic range of this measurement was limited due to the small bandwidth of the nbs such that the largest angle with sufficient signal to noise was 25@xmath170 from center . at this angle , @xmath171 and the function displayed a sharp slope , suggesting it continues to fall at higher angles .",
    "the night - side brightness of the earth in the nbs band is dominated by airglow emission and is approximately @xmath172 nw m@xmath60 sr@xmath61 @xcite at 854 nm . as the earth limb is @xmath173 off - axis during observations ,",
    "the maximum projected solid angle is @xmath174 sr . even in the overly conservative case in which @xmath168 is assumed to remain flat at @xmath175 to higher angles than were measured in the lab , the integral in equation  [ eq : straylight ] results in a signal @xmath176  nw m@xmath60 sr@xmath61 .",
    "we therefore conclude that off - axis emission from the earth contributes a negligible systematic error to the measurement .",
    "the nbs must be accurately calibrated in order to compare our zl measurements with zl models based on dirbe observations .",
    "specifically , we need to translate the nbs zl measurements to the dirbe @xmath177 m band with an accuracy of @xmath178% to distinguish between models . to perform this comparison",
    ", we must absolutely calibrate the nbs , then translate the zl brightness measured at @xmath179 nm to @xmath177 m using the ciber - lrs zl spectral color . to reduce the contribution of the uncertainty in the nbs calibration to the overall uncertainty in this chain , the nbs must be accurately calibrated relative to dirbe . for comparison ,",
    "the absolute calibration uncertainty in standard calibration stars like vega is typically @xmath180 and the @xmath181 m dirbe channel absolute calibration uncertainty is 3% @xcite obtained on sirius .",
    "in addition to the laboratory calibration we describe below , the nbs observes vega in every flight for an independent calibration check .",
    "a schematic representation of the nbs calibration set up is shown in figure 15 of @xcite , where light from a stable source is coupled into an integrating sphere which is viewed by the nbs and a reference detector absolutely calibrated by nist .",
    "the radiance of the light source is varied and the response of the nbs is referenced to the detector .",
    "our primary photometric calibration measurements are derived from the monochromatic data described in detail in section  [ ss : wavelength ] which use the sircus laser facility as the stabilized light source @xcite .",
    "the reference detectors which measure absolute radiance are constructed of single element large area si photodiodes and baffles that limit the angular extent light reaching the detector .",
    "a smaller sphere feeding the larger sphere , which is viewed by the nbs , is constantly monitored with si photodiodes to ensure the light levels remain known during the nbs calibration given the ratio of large sphere radiance to monitor signal previously determined with the reference detectors .",
    "uncertainties in the deduced narrow band radiance are approximately 0.3% , dominated by contributions from the sphere uniformity and the effects of out - of - field light .",
    "photocurrent measurements using the laser source determine the nbs absolute responsivity , at a discrete set of wavelengths .",
    "we calculate an array - wide map of the calibration factor ( @xmath182 ) for a spectrally flat source from the ratio of the measured nbs photocurrent and absolute radiance .",
    "the integral is evaluated from scans of the sircus laser across a 100  nm wide range . after applying the flat field correction , described in section  [ ss : flatfield ] ,",

    "the @xmath184 uncertainty in the quoted absolute calibration factor is determined by the variance across all pixels in the array , added in quadrature with the @xmath185 systematic uncertainty from the absolute calibration quoted by nist .",
    "this calibration factor was checked by coupling a supercontiuum laser source to the integrating sphere referenced to a detector system capable of @xmath186 spectral measurements , calibrated to measure radiance traceable to fixed - point blackbodies .",
    "the supercontinuum laser produces a relatively flat featureless spectrum across the nbs band .",
    "measurements of the photocurrent induced by the broad band source were taken at four light levels ranging from 500 to 2000  e@xmath187 while simultaneously monitoring the absolute radiance of the sphere .",
    "dark signals were referenced to the ambient light background of the laboratory .",
    "each exposure is corrected using the flat field template described in section  [ ss : flatfield ] .",

    "this allows for a more sophisticated treatment of flight data .",
    "the response over the array may be calculated for any source spectrum using equation  [ eq : ilambda ] .",
