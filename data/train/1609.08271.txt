    "the explicit consideration and self - consistent implementation of the evolution of turbulence in expanding plasma flows is a focus of contemporary modeling of astrophysical flow phenomena .",
    "this is particularly so for the solar wind ; see the review - like introductions in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this considerable improvement , relative to non - self - consistent modeling , is , on the one hand , necessary in order to fully understand the transport of charged energetic particles in the heliosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and via this to explore the physics of their interactions with the plasma turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , the correct description of the transport of cosmic rays in other astrophysical systems is also of great interest .",
    "for example , in astrospheres , i.e. , circumstellar regions occupied by stellar winds , it is of high relevance in the context of exoplanet research ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and potentially for an understanding of cosmic ray anisotropy at high energy @xcite .",
    "another example is the , at least partly diffusive , cosmic ray transport in galactic halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "modeling of the transport of solar wind turbulence has advanced considerably since the early model of @xcite , which was itself a major step forward from wkb transport theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "improved inertial range models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and energy - containing range models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been presented .",
    "these have often included additional effects , such as heating of the solar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , non - zero cross helicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , non - constant difference in velocity @xmath0 and magnetic field @xmath1 fluctuation energy ( sometimes called residual energy , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and different correlation lengths for @xmath0 and @xmath1 as well as for the elsasser fluctuations @xcite .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for reviews of this progress .",
    "another extension concerns the nature of the fluctuations .",
    "models like those mentioned above typically treat the fluctuations as being of a single kind , typically either waves or some form of turbulence .",
    "@xcite developed a model where propagating high - frequency wave - like fluctuations and low - frequency , perpendicularly cascading , thus quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) turbulent fluctuations are both supported ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this approach , referred to as _ two - component _ turbulence modeling , explicitly acknowledges the presence of both turbulence and wave - like fluctuations and has distinct advantages compared to the ` traditional ' one - component modeling .",
    "first , it is commonly agreed that there are at least two turbulence drivers , namely stream shear at low frequencies and unstable pick - up ion velocity distributions at high frequencies .",
    "clearly , the separation of the turbulence into two corresponding frequency components allows for a more ` natural ' quantitative formulation and modeling of the distinct driving processes .",
    "second , this decomposition permits a fairly detailed treatment of nonlinear interactions of wave - like and quasi-2d components with each other and amongst themselves @xcite . and ,",
    "third , assuming these two components to determine with sufficient accuracy the slab and 2d turbulence quantities required in contemporary cosmic ray transport theory , they form the basis of so - called _ ab initio _ modeling of cosmic ray modulation @xcite .    in order to self - consistently couple turbulence transport models to those of the large - scale structure of the heliosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or astrospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the former must be formulated in three spatial dimensions .",
    "this has been done for the one - component model by @xcite .",
    "another generalization concerns the removal of the limitation of the model s validity for the super - alfvnic solar / stellar wind regimes , which ",
    "again for the one - component model  has been achieved recently in a non - self - consistent fashion by @xcite and fully self - consistently by @xcite . naturally , it is desirable to make both extensions also for the two - component turbulence model .",
    "this is the objective of the present paper , whose structure we now outline .",
    "we formulate the basic equations of the two - component phenomenology and its coupling to the large - scale mhd equations in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "the implementation in the cronos numerical framework is presented in section  [ sec : results ] , along with numerical results .",
    "these include a computational validation with respect to the simpler @xcite model , and results from the new two - component model with its more realistic background solar wind . a comparison with spacecraft data is also presented .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : mfps ] , the findings are used to calculate diffusion and drift coefficients for the transport of cosmic rays in the heliosphere .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outlook on future improvements in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we begin by introducing our notation for the large - scale and small - scale fields .",
    "the total solar wind velocity is written @xmath2 , the sum of a large - scale piece dependent upon the heliocentric position vector @xmath3 , and a small - scale contribution that depends also upon local small - scale coordinates @xmath4 , relative to each @xmath3 .",
    "similary the total magnetic field is @xmath5 , with associated large - scale alfvn speed @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the large - scale mass density .",
    "the small - scale dynamics is treated as incompressible ( see @xcite for a discussion of transport of density fluctuations ) . as a simplifying assumption ,",
    "the fluctuation amplitudes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are restricted to be transverse to @xmath8 ; that is , parallel variances are neglected .",
    "solar wind observations indicate this is often a reasonable approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in general , the above quantities are also time - dependent .",
    "the large - scale wind velocity @xmath9 is with respect to an inertial frame ; in the frame co - rotating with the sun the large - scale velocity is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the solar angular rotation rate .",
    "our numerical computations are often performed in this co - rotating frame . in obtaining the transport equations in this frame",
    "we make use of the relation @xmath12 which holds because @xmath13 .",
    "the two - component aspect of the model involves separating the fluctuations into two precisely defined incompressible elements : quasi-2d turbulence and a complementary wave - like component @xcite .",
    "specifically , employing elsasser variables , @xmath14 , we express the fluctuations as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the quasi-2d and wave - like components , respectively ; both quantities are functions of the ( large - scale ) heliocentric radius @xmath3 and the small - scale displacements @xmath4 from each @xmath3 .",
    "table  [ tab : quantities ] summarizes the definitions of the major energy - related fluctuation quantities which appear in the transport model . for the quasi-2d component ,",
    "@xmath18 is the normalized cross helicity , and @xmath19 the normalized energy difference , equal to the ( normalized ) kinetic energy less the magnetic energy all divided by the sum of these . in general",
    ", the analogous quantity for the wave - like component is indicated by a subscript or superscript @xmath20 .",
    "c c c quasi-2d & & wave - like + fluctuations & quantity & fluctuations + @xmath21 & elsasser ` energies ' & @xmath22 + @xmath23 & total ` energies ' & @xmath24 + @xmath25 & cross helicities & @xmath26 + @xmath27 & normalized cross helicities & @xmath28 + @xmath29 & normalized energy differences & @xmath30 +    along with the energies ( per mass ) of the fluctuations , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , it is also necessary to consider their characteristic lengthscales , typically defined using correlation lengths . in general , these are distinct for each type of field ; for example , @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 fo @xmath36 . here we make the simplifying assumption that these scales are equal and denote the characteristic lengthscale of @xmath37 as @xmath38 and that of @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the typical _ parallel _ scale of the wave - like component , @xmath41 , is needed , particularly in connection with driving by pickup ions .",
    "( for one - component transport models that consider the @xmath42 lengthscales separately see @xcite and @xcite . )    finally in this section , we address the suitability of using incompressible mhd to model solar wind fluctuations .",
    "naturally , the actual solar wind fluctuations will often display some compressive activity . here , however , from the outset we approximate them as being incompressible and thus neglect small - scale compressive behaviour . on the observational side ,",
    "density fluctuations are often found to be @xmath43 of the mean value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing motivation for neglecting compressive activity at this level .",
    "on the theory side , the nearly incompressible approach for systems with small mach numbers @xcite , leads to a leading - order description that is either incompressible 3d mhd ( large plasma beta ) or incompressible 2d mhd ( beta small or order unity ) .",
    "the next order corrections are termed ` nearly incompressible ' ( ni ) and support mhd waves . in particular , when beta is order unity , as is typical for the solar wind , the ni solutions include alfvn waves with timescales shorter than those associated with the leading - order incompressible behaviour .",
    "thus , modeling the system as we do herein , i.e. , using incompressible quasi-2d and incompressible wave - like components , is consistent with the nearly incompressible results .",
    "the transport and driving terms  for the energy , cross helicity , and characteristic lengthscales of the fluctuations  have been derived and discussed in various works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we largely follow the approach of @xcite and @xcite , extended to incorporate the homogeneous two - component phenomenology presented in @xcite and also retaining terms of order @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following equations for the fluctuation energies , in the frame co - rotating with the sun , @xmath45      \\nonumber \\\\   & &          \\ ; - \\ ;           { \\alpha_z}\\left [               \\frac{z^3 } { \\ell }          f^+_{zz }             + \\frac{2w z^2 } { \\ell }    \\frac{f^+_{zw } } { 1 + z / w }          \\right ]          \\ ; + \\ ;             { \\alpha_z}x^+      \\nonumber \\\\   & &          \\ ; + \\ ;           \\frac{z^2}{r}{{c_\\text{sh}}^z}| { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{u}}}}| ,                                                          \\label{eq : z2-dot } \\\\   { \\frac{\\partial{w^2 } } { \\partial{t } } }   & = &         - \\nabla \\cdot ( { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}}w^2 + { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}_{\\!\\!\\!a}}{h_c^w } )         + 2 { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}_{\\!\\!\\!a}}\\cdot \\nabla { h_c^w}+ \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\nabla \\cdot{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{u } } } } ) { w^2 }      \\nonumber \\\\   & &         - { \\sigma_{d}^w}w^2             \\left [                    \\frac{\\nabla \\cdot { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{u}}}}}{2 }                -    \\hat{{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}\\cdot ( \\hat{{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{b } } } } } \\cdot \\nabla ) { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{u}}}}\\right ]      \\nonumber \\\\   & &          \\ ; - \\ ;            { { \\alpha_w}}\\left [           \\frac { 2 w^2 z } { \\lambda }             \\frac { f^+_{wz } } { 1 + \\lambda/\\ell }          +            \\frac { 2 w^4 \\lambda_\\parallel}{\\lambda^2 v_a }             ( 1 - { \\sigma_{c , w}}^2 )          \\right ]          -   { \\alpha_z}x^+      \\nonumber \\\\   & &          \\ ; + \\ ;           \\frac{w^2}{r}{{c_\\text{sh}}^w}| { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{u}}}}|          \\ ; + \\ ;            \\dot{e}_\\text{pi } ,                                                          \\label{eq : w2-dot } \\\\   { \\frac{\\partial{{h_c^z } } } { \\partial{t } } }   & = &         - \\nabla \\cdot ( { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}}{h_c^z}+ { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}_{\\!\\!\\!a}}z^2 )         + 2 { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}_{\\!\\!\\!a}}\\cdot \\nabla z^2         + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\nabla \\cdot{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{u } } } } ) { { h_c^z } }      \\nonumber \\\\   & &         + { \\sigma_{d}^z}z^2            \\left [                  \\nabla \\cdot { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}_{\\!\\!\\!a}}+ \\frac { \\hat{{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}\\cdot ( \\hat{{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{b } } } } } \\cdot \\nabla ) { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{b } } } } }                       { \\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho } }            \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\   & &          \\ ; - \\ ;            { \\alpha_z}\\left [                  \\frac{z^3 } {   \\ell }          f^-_{zz }               +   \\frac{2 w z^2 } { \\ell }    \\frac{f^-_{zw } } { 1 + z / w }            \\right ]       + { \\alpha_z}x^- ,                                                             \\label{eq : hcz - dot } \\\\   { \\frac{\\partial{{h_c^w } } } { \\partial{t } } }   & = &         - \\nabla \\cdot ( { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}}{h_c^w}+ { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}_{\\!\\!\\!a}}w^2 )         + 2 { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}_{\\!\\!\\!a}}\\cdot \\nabla w^2         + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\nabla \\cdot{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{u } } } } ) { { h_c^w } }      \\nonumber \\\\   & &         + { \\sigma_{d}^w}w^2            \\left [                  \\nabla \\cdot { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}_{\\!\\!\\!a}}+ \\frac { \\hat{{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}\\cdot ( \\hat{{{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{b } } } } } \\cdot \\nabla ) { { \\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{b } } } } }                       { \\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho } }            \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\    & &          \\ ; - \\ ;            { { \\alpha_w}}\\left [           \\frac{2 w^2 z}{\\lambda }             \\frac { f^-_{wz } } { 1 + \\lambda/\\ell }          \\right ]          - { \\alpha_z}x^-   ,                                                          \\label{eq : hcw - dot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 ,                                                          \\label{eq : ypm } \\\\    \\gamma^{ab}_c          & = &      \\frac{1 } { 1 + \\tau_{\\text{nl}}^{ab } / \\tau_a^c } ,                                                          \\label{eq : gamma } \\\\    2 f^{\\pm}_{ab }         & = &            \\left ( 1 + \\sigma^a \\right )   \\sqrt{1 - \\sigma^b }           \\pm            \\left ( 1 - \\sigma^a \\right )   \\sqrt{1 + \\sigma^b } ,                                                          \\label{eq : f - pm - ab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 or @xmath48 for the component @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",

    "( [ eq : lamparprs ] ) on @xmath268 , this is balanced to some degree by an increase of the proton larmor radius at these radial distances . at higher latitudes ,",
    "the flattening of the parallel mean free path commences at larger radial distances and is less obvious than in the ecliptic , due in part to the latitudinal dependence of the extent of the ionization cavity as modelled here ( see section [ sec : validation ] and fig .",

    "the parallel mean free path assumes relatively uniform values as function of latitude .",
    "this behaviour is simply due to the variance .",
    "the perpendicular mean free path appears to decrease as function of radial distance due to the fact that pickup ions do not directly contribute to @xmath66 .",
    "this decrease is steeper in the ecliptic plane than at higher latitudes , reflecting the radial decrease in @xmath66 at different latitudes as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : oughton - lineplots ] . the perpendicular mean free path also consistently assumes higher values at higher latitudes than in the ecliptic plane , again a consequence of the behaviour of @xmath66 , and hence of @xmath270 .",

    "mean free path assumes relatively high values which can not be associated with a corresponding increase in @xmath66 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : oughton - slices ] .",

    "[ fig : drifts ] .",
    "globally , these expressions yield very different results , with the @xcite drift scale being in general considerably larger than the @xcite scale .",
    "the latter drift scale displays a considerably more complicated spatial dependence than the former , a consequence of its additional dependences on the various correlation lengthscales calculated in the turbulence transport model .",
    "the @xcite drift scales become very small at intermediate latitudes due to the enhanced levels of turbulence associated with regions where stream - shear effects are significant .",
    "this behaviour is not readily apparent when the @xcite drift scale is considered .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that both drift scales yield results that are larger over the poles than in the ecliptic plane .",
    "the transport coefficients discussed here display complex dependences on the various turbulence quantities , and hence have spatial dependences that are far more complex than those usually assumed in cosmic ray modulation studies .",
    "the latitude dependences of the drift coefficients alone , given the directions in which cosmic rays drift in periods of positive and negative magnetic polarity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can be expected to lead to interesting consequences for modulation studies .",
    "furthermore , given the sensitivity of solutions to the parker transport equation to choices made for the diffusion and drift terms , the use of self - consistently computed transport coefficients such as those presented here can be expected to lead to new insights in the field of cosmic ray modulation in both the region enclosed by the termination shock and potentially beyond , i.e. , in the inner heliosheath .",
    "we have generalized the two - component turbulence model developed by @xcite and @xcite to a self - consistent treatement with respect to the solar wind plasma .",
    "this generalization consists , first , in a fully three - dimensional formulation of the evolution equations of the two - component phenomenology , i.e. , the high - frequency parallel propagating wave - like and the low - frequency perpendicularly cascading quasi-2d turbulent fluctuations .",
    "this includes both a discussion of the most suitable way to formulate the evolution equations for the corresponding correlation lengthscales in order to obtain a closed system for all large - scale and small - scale quantities and a discussion of the correct choice for the structural similarity parameters that implies the occurrence of additional mixing terms in the equations for the energies ( per unit mass ) and cross helicities .",
    "second , we have extended the previous modeling by ( i ) not neglecting transport and mixing terms involving the alfvn velocity , ( ii ) taking into account the solar wind stream shear , and ( iii ) using a state - of - the - art formulation of the efficiency of the so - called pick - up ion driving @xcite .",
    "after an implementation in the mhd modeling framework cronos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the new model , consisting of the generalized turbulence evolution equations self - consistently coupled with those for the large - scale expansion of the solar wind , was validated against the spherically symmetric results obtained earlier by @xcite for a prescribed background solar wind .    as a first application",

    "these improvements comprise the inclusion and improved reproduction of off - ecliptic ulyssses results and , due to the additional alfvn velocity terms , a better agreement of the computed energy - weighted cross helicity with that derived from observations .    as a second application we have used the new results for the wave - like and quasi-2d fluctuations to calculate _ ab initio _ diffusion",

    "with respect to the particle drifts we employed state - of - the - art expressions derived by @xcite and @xcite for turbulence - reduced drift scales via fits to simulations of the drift coefficient for various turbulence conditions . while , interestingly , both drift scenarios predict larger scales above the sun s poles than in the ecliptic plane , they yield rather different results , in general . on the one hand",
    "the drift scale of @xcite is considerably larger than that of @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the latter exhibits a comparatively complex spatial dependence as a consequence of its additional dependences on the various correlation lengthscales . in view of the sensitivity of the solution of the cosmic ray transport equation to the diffusion and drift coefficients",

    "we have demonstrated the feasibility to self - consistently take into account all terms containing the alfvn velocity .",
    "the explicit incorporation of the latter allowed not only for the extension of the model to all heliographic latitudes and longitudes but will particularly allow quantitative studies of the sub - alfvnic solar wind regions in the inner heliosphere ( as in * ? ? ? * ) close to the sun and is also a pre - requisite for applications to the heliosheath whose turbulent structure is as yet unmodelled .",
