    "bubbles play an important role in the sound propagation in everyday life liquids .",
    "for example , the murmur of the brooks essentially originates , as first suggested by bragg@xcite , in the oscillations of air bubbles captured and dragged along by the water . the so - called `` hot chocolate effect '' , namely the rising of sound pitch when one repeatedly taps the bottom of the mug in which some instant coffee or chocolate is being dissolved , is explained by the releasing into the water of the tiny bubbles trapped in the powder@xcite .",
    "bubble dynamics and acoustic properties of liquids containing a large number of bubbles have been widely studied for a long time@xcite .",
    "a very good and complete review in this domain was achieved by leighton@xcite .",
    "_ inter alia _ , the problem of the interaction of two neighbouring bubbles has been discussed using fluid dynamics tools@xcite or the acoustic - electrostatic analogy@xcite .",
    "moreover , the _ free _ oscillations of a system of two ( and even three ) air cavities formed in a metal plate lying on a water surface have been theoretically and experimentally investigated in detail ( including cubic nonlinearities)@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present article is to present a simple , readily reproducible , experimental study of the _ forced _ oscillation regime of a two - air bubble system in water .",
    "we begin with a short introductory theory in which we show that the two - bubble system is mostly equivalent to a set of two magnetically coupled electric circuits .",
    "an air bubble in water will be considered as a perfect sphere of radius @xmath1 , with variation @xmath2 much smaller than equilibrium value @xmath3 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath4 oscillates with minnaert s angular frequency @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the specific heat ratio @xmath7 of air , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively stand for the equilibrium pressure for a typical radius of @xmath10 ( see @xcite eq .",
    "( 65b ) ) and will be neglected : @xmath8 is _ also _ the equilibrium pressure of enclosed air . ] and mass density of water .",
    "this oscillation is damped through several mechanisms : of course the acoustic radiation damping ( thanks to which the bubble noise is audible ) , but also the viscous and thermal dampings@xcite .",
    "we will neglect , in the following simplified theory , the last two ones .",
    "moreover , allowing for the typical @xmath11 acoustic frequency and @xmath10 bubble size we deal with in our experiment , we will neglect any sound propagation in the enclosed air .",
    "we thus deliberately restrict the present study to the ( radial ) fundamental resonance of the air bubble - water system .",
    "let us consider one bubble with radius @xmath3 immersed in an infinite volume of water at equilibrium pressure @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the actual pressure at site @xmath13 and instant @xmath14 .",
    "the extra pressure @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 . according to minnaert s assumption , the enclosed air undergoes isentropic transformations and its ( extra ) pressure @xmath17 is homogeneous inside the bubble .",
    "then , neglecting air s inertia as well as the air - water surface tension , @xmath17 and the radius variation @xmath4 are linked by : @xmath18 on the other hand , it can be easily shown that ( extra ) pressure @xmath19 at distance @xmath20 from the center of the bubble follows a dalembert - like 1d equation , the solution of which exactly reads , for @xmath21 : @xmath22(t-\\frac{r - r_0}{c})\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the sound velocity in water .",
    "if the acoustic wavelength @xmath24 is much larger than @xmath20 ( i.e. , under the circumstances , if condition @xmath25 is fulfilled ) , then @xmath19 can be approximated by : @xmath26 \\nonumber \\\\         & \\simeq &   \\rho_0 r_0 ^ 2 \\left[\\frac{\\xi^{''}(t)}{r}+\\frac{\\omega^2_0}{c }                    \\xi^{'}(t ) \\right ] \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , equalling @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , one gets , all calculations carried out : @xmath28 which is the well - known differential equation of a weakly is actually assumed to be much smaller than unity , as a consequence of the the validity condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . ]",
    "damped 1d harmonic oscillator .",
    "let us now add a second bubble , with the same ( equilibrium ) radius @xmath3 , at a distance @xmath29 apart from the first one .",
    "let @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) be the ( equilibrium ) position of the @xmath32 bubble center , @xmath33 its radius variation , @xmath34 the ( inner ) extra pressure of the enclosed air , and @xmath35 ( resp . @xmath36 the would - be ( outer)extra pressure ( resp .",
    "displacement with respect to equilibrium ) at point @xmath13 and instant @xmath14 in the water medium if bubble @xmath37 was alone .",
    "then , allowing for the superposition principle for small displacements , we assume that overall water extra pressure and displacement respectively read :    @xmath38    with , of course , @xmath34 and @xmath33 still linked by eq.([eq1 ] ) . on the surface of the first bubble : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "a similar constraint is required on the surface of the second bubble , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 . if the bubble spacing @xmath29 is much smaller than @xmath24 ( i.e. @xmath44 ) is of order @xmath45 , while @xmath29 ranges from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "] , then eq .  ( [ eq3 ] ) is available and we finally get the following pair of coupled motion equations : @xmath48 where @xmath49 can be regarded as a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "observe , by the way , that if double condition : @xmath50 is fulfilled , eqs .",
    "( [ eq6a ] ) and ( [ eq6b ] ) are available ( with @xmath51 ) , and dynamic variables @xmath52 are still coupled by radiation damping , since the dissipation terms do not involve @xmath53 .    defining symmetrical and antisymmetrical normal variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 as respectively the sum and the difference of @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ", we get the uncoupled equations system : @xmath58 it is noteworthy that , as far as only radiation is concerned , the symmetrical mode s damping rate is twice the single - bubble s one , while the antisymmetrical mode is undamped.this feature is easily understood in terms of constructive ( resp .",
    "destructive ) interference between the acoustic waves radiated by each bubble , and parallels a well - known situation in the atomic physics domain ( super- and sub- radiant quantum states of a couple of identical atoms interacting with each other through the e.m .",
    "field ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq7a ] ) and ( [ eq7b ] ) , it is clear that the symmetrical mode has the lower angular frequency @xmath59 , and the antisymmetrical mode the higher one @xmath60 . observe that , leaving apart the calculation of radiative damping , it is very easy to derive above expressions of @xmath61 using the following trick .",
    "let us consider the water as an uncompressible fluid ( i.e. @xmath62 ) .",
    "the water displacement due to bubble @xmath37 s motion simply reads : @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "then , allowing for eq .",
    "( [ eq5b ] ) , the overall water kinetic energy @xmath65 is : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the effective mass of either bubble . on the other hand , the total potential energy @xmath68 associated with the isentropic compressibility of the enclosed air",
    "reads : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the effective stiffness of either bubble .",
    "the lagrange equations derived from @xmath71 are : @xmath72 which is exactly the @xmath73 limit of eqs .",
    "( [ eq6a ] ) and ( [ eq6b ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that eqs .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) through ( [ eq11b ] ) are formally equivalent to those of a system of two ( @xmath74 ) electric circuits coupled by mutual induction with coefficient @xmath75 . in this analogy ,",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively correspond to @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the @xmath52 s to the electric charges @xmath80 of either capacitor .",
    "let us now suppose that the above studied two - bubble system is driven by an external acoustic source with an angular frequency @xmath81 near minnaert s one , @xmath82 .",
    "the phase difference of the driving pressures on both bubbles can therefore be neglected , since @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath84 be the external pressure undergone by bubble @xmath37 .",
    "motion eqs .",
    "( [ eq6a ] ) and ( [ eq6b ] ) are then completed in : @xmath85 or equivalently : @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 . solving for @xmath89 and @xmath90 in above eqs .",
    "( [ eq13a ] ) and ( [ eq13b ] ) , one gets @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and consequently ( using eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) ) quantities @xmath91 and @xmath92 at any point @xmath13 of the medium .",
    "at last , comparing external ( applied ) pressure @xmath93 with the actual overall extra pressure @xmath94 , we can experimentally measure the two - bubble system s response as a function of @xmath81 . in this respect ( and provided that the excitation - detection geometry allows it ) , resonances are expected for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "our aim is to demonstrate the existence of both above mentioned modes . from an experimental point of view",
    ", it turns out to be easier to implement a forced oscillation scheme than a free oscillation one .",
    "we therefore present the former hereafter .",
    "a small net ( see fig.1 ) , made up with a gauze maintained with a wire , is designed to catch up an air bubble in water and to fix it at any desired position without appreciably modifying acoustic impedance and spherical symmetry .",
    "two such devices are used for studying the two - bubble system .",
    "the external driving source is a speaker and extrapressure @xmath15 is measured with a small microphone .",
    "a function generator , to which the speaker is connected , produces a c.w .",
    "sinusoidal signal with a frequency slowly swept from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "the signal delivered by the microphone is transmitted to a lock - in amplifier which compares it with the reference one ( delivered by the function generator ) and decomposes it into real and imaginary parts .",
    "both parts can be seen on an oscilloscope and recorded with a computer ( see fig.2 ) .    in a preliminary set of experiments , without any bubble in the aquarium , the response of the microphone is calibrated for different speaker - microphone configurations .",
    "two kinds of configurations are presented in figure  3 . in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) the configuration is deliberately asymmetrical : the microphone is mainly susceptible to bubble 2 s motion , while the speaker selectively drives bubble 2 ( fig .",
    "3(a ) ) or bubble 1 ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , so that @xmath99 is nonzero : both modes can be excited and the associated motions detected . in fig .",
    "3(c ) , the speaker is placed far from the bubbles ; then , not only the phases , but also the amplitudes of the external pressures @xmath100 and @xmath101 undergone on either bubble are appreciably equal . in such a symmetrical excitation configuration ,",
    "@xmath102 , so that the antisymmetrical mode remains unexcited .",
    "observe , by the way , that since distances @xmath103 and @xmath104 between the bubbles and the microphone are equal , the latter would detect no contribution from the antisymmetrical mode _ even though _ it was excited ( see eqs.([eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq5a ] ) : @xmath105 and @xmath106 yields @xmath107 ) .      in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) , the imaginary part @xmath108 of the output signal from the lock - in amplifier is displayed versus the speaker frequency @xmath109 for various values of the bubbles spacing @xmath29 .",
    "figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) respectively correspond to configurations 3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "two resonances can be made out in fig 4(a ) and ( though at a lesser degree ) in fig 4(b ) .",
    "observe that the sign of the signal at the higher frequency resonance is changed from 4(a ) to 4(b ) , while the lower frequency one remains unchanged .",
    "this is consistent with the latter signal being associated with the symmetrical mode s resonance ( @xmath110 , and @xmath111 unchanged from configuration 3(a ) to 3(b ) ) , and the former one with the antisymmetrical mode s resonance @xmath112 , and @xmath113 changed into @xmath114 from configuration 3(a ) to 3(b ) ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that both resonances have appreciably the same width .",
    "this is in contradiction with simplified eqs.([eq7a ] ) and ( [ eq7b ] ) ( or ( [ eq13a ] ) and ( [ eq13b ] ) ) , in which only the radiation damping was considered .",
    "in fact , as mentioned in introduction , other kinds of damping should be taken into account : if viscous damping is absolutely negligible for such large bubbles , thermal damping is not ( see fig.8 in @xcite ) , and may be at the origin of the linewidth .",
    "further discussion of this point is out of the scope of the present paper . in figure 5 , we have plotted , for both symmetrical and antisymmetrical modes , and for @xmath115 , the inverse squared frequency @xmath116 ( multiplied by a factor of @xmath117 ) versus the inverse bubble spacing @xmath118 , in order to get a visual check of theoretical relations : @xmath119    although experimental points are appreciably aligned , the measured slopes are about @xmath120 below theoretical prediction , suggesting that coupling constant @xmath53 has been overestimated .",
    "in fact , theoretical value @xmath121 was derived in eq.([eq9 ] ) when integrating the water kinetic energy density @xmath122 over the whole space in integral ( [ eq9 ] ) _ does not _ depend on the bubbles radius @xmath3 . ] .",
    "this inertial coupling is naturally lowered if some obstacle lies between the bubbles and consequently screens ( part of ) the water flow is modified too , but at a lesser degree . ] .",
    "now , this is exactly what happens in configurations 3(a ) and 3(b ) : to be able to excite the antisymmetrical mode , we are compelled to insert the speaker between the two bubbles , thus bringing about the above screening effect . in order to check this interpretation",
    ", we performed the same experiment with configuration 3(c ) , and recorded , for the symmetrical branch of the linear fitting of fig .  5 , a slope of about @xmath123 of the theoretically predicted value .    at last ,",
    "it should be noted that , when blocked from the top by the net , the bubble is , strictly speaking , no longer spherical . as mentioned in footnote 1 ,",
    "such a deviation from the spherical shape is ( almost ) of no consequence , and we have used the formulas derived above in section 2 with @xmath3 standing for the radius of the sphere of equivalent volume ( _ i.e. _ the radius of the bubble before it is captured by the net ) .",
    "nevertheless , this feature of our experimental setup raises the following difficulty : since , in course of motion , the fixed point of the bubble is no longer its centre ( as implicitly assumed in the theoretical model ) but its top , expression ( [ radius ] ) of the water displacement is no longer correct ; a dipolar term should be added to the spherical monopolar one . as a consequence ,",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath65 derived in eq.([eq9 ] ) is modified too .",
    "more precisely , an exact calulation shows that @xmath65 should be multiplied by a factor of @xmath124 and the coupling constant @xmath53 by a factor of @xmath125 .",
    "these corrections lie within our experimental accuracy .",
    "we have consequently neglected them . in this respect , it may be noted that the gauze in our device _ does not _ act like a rigid wall because the water can flow through the meshes of the net .",
    "the situation is therefore different from that discused in other studies@xcite considering the influence of the proximity of a rigid boundary on the minnaert frequency .",
    "as a conclusion , the acoustic inertial coupling between two air bubbles in water has been experimentally put in evidence .",
    "theoretical analysis shows that the two - bubble system is formally equivalent to a set of two magnetically coupled ( @xmath78,@xmath126 ) electric circuits , with two eigenmodes , respectively symmetrical and antisymmetrical .",
    "experimental measurements and theoretical predictions are in @xmath0 accuracy agreement .",
    "we gratefully thank professor f.massias for enriching discussions about the correction to the minnaert frequency in the case of a bubble fixed from the top by a wide - mesh net .",
