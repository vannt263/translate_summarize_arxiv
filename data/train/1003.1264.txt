    "<S> we study the main properties of the one - loop vacuum polarization function ( @xmath0 ) for massless spinor @xmath1 in a slab , namely , with fields defined on @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 , and bag - like boundary conditions on the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the induced charge density and current due to an external constant electric field normal to the boundary ; we also study the effective action for a purely transverse field , identifying its @xmath4-dependent contribution .    in the presence of nontrivial boundary conditions </S>",
    "<S> , quantum field theory models may give rise to many interesting effects . </S>",
    "<S> noteworthy examples of them are the casimir effect  @xcite , the bag model of qcd  @xcite , as well as many others  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the common origin of those effects is the presence of boundaries , which strongly affect the structure of the vacuum fluctuations ; this fact has relevance not only for global observables , i.e. , casimir energies , but also for local ones , like vacuum energy densities and response functions . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , which are determined by the correlation between fluctuations should exhibit a strong dependence with the distance to the boundary ( at least for the ones involving degrees of freedom affected by the boundary conditions ) .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the vacuum polarization tensor , @xmath5 , for a dirac field confined to a slab - shaped region @xmath6 , defined by the condition @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> more concretely , we consider a massless dirac field in @xmath8 dimensions , which satisfies ` bag ' ( i.e. , vanishing normal current ) boundary conditions on the two static planes @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> euclidean spacetime coordinates are , in the conventions that we shall use , denoted by @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we shall assume the dirac field to be confined to the region between those mirrors ; hence , @xmath5 vanishes identically outside of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> it there are fermions outside of the slab , @xmath5 does not vanish there . however , their properties in that region are equivalent to the case of just one boundary ; for example , if @xmath13 , @xmath5 in that region is the same as the one for a single wall at @xmath9 .    in the conventions we shall use , </S>",
    "<S> euclidean coordinates are denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , while the metric tensor is given by @xmath16 .    to account for the effect of the confined fermion fluctuations on the gauge field propagation , </S>",
    "<S> one introduces : @xmath17 where the fermionic action , @xmath18 accounts for the ( minimal ) coupling to the gauge field as well as for the introduction of the bag boundary conditions . to deal with the latter , </S>",
    "<S> we follow the approach of representing them by local interaction terms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the resulting propagator should agree with the one one would get by using , for example , the multiple reflection expansion ( mre ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that approach has been used in  @xcite for the calculation of @xmath5 for a dirac field in a half - space .    following  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we include a ` potential ' @xmath19 into the fermionic action , so that : @xmath20 \\psi(x)\\ ] ] with @xmath21 \\;.\\ ] ] here , @xmath22 is a constant which , in order to enforce bag boundary conditions , has to be equal to @xmath23  . </S>",

    "<S> , we may write , @xmath26 \\;,\\ ] ] which allows us to introduce the vacuum polarization , @xmath5 , the kernel determining the form of the first non - trivial term for the expansion of @xmath27 in powers of @xmath28 : @xmath29    from ( [ eq : gef ] ) , we may give a more explicit , yet formal , expression for @xmath5 in coordinate space : @xmath30 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the ( coordinate space ) exact fermion propagator for @xmath32 , namely , the free propagator with bag boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this object may be obtained as the matrix elements of the inverse of an operator : @xmath33 where a ` bracket ' notation has been used to denote the coordinate space versions of operators ( in this case , the inverse of @xmath34 ) . since the boundary conditions only affect the @xmath35 coordinate , there is symmetry under translations in the ` parallel ' coordinates @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath37 , and it is natural to work with @xmath38 , a mixed fourier representation of @xmath31 which results by transforming the parallel coordinates only , so that .    this reduces the problem to a one - dimensional one , where @xmath38 satisfies the equation : @xmath39\\ , \\widetilde{s}_f(p_\\shortparallel ; x_3 , y_3)\\,=\\ , \\delta ( x_3 - y_3)\\;.\\ ] ] the solution to the inhomogeneous linear equation above may be written as the sum of two terms : @xmath40 where the first of them , @xmath41 , is the free fermion propagator in the absence of boundaries , while the other , denoted by @xmath42 accounts for the boundary ( bag ) conditions .    </S>",

    "<S> once those objects are found , the outcome of this procedure is an explicit expression for @xmath52 , which can be expressed as a sum of terms , distinguished according to its @xmath24-matrix content : @xmath53 where we have introduced four functions @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) . </S>",

    "<S> we now analyze the uv properties of the propagator @xmath38 , as presented in ( [ eq : suma ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the two terms have a quite different behaviour . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , the first one , @xmath64 , being the free propagator in the absence of boundaries , does have the well - known uv behaviour ( @xmath65 in momentum space ) . in the ` mixed ' fourier representation , where it depends on @xmath66 and @xmath67 , that behaviour translates into a @xmath68 behaviour when @xmath69 , and an exponential decay when @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath71 term , on the other hand , decays exponentially everywhere , except when both @xmath35 and @xmath63 approach one ( the same ) boundary , namely , when either @xmath72 or @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can trace the origin of that behaviour to see that it comes from the @xmath74 and @xmath75 terms ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 always decrease exponentially , regardless of the values of @xmath35 and @xmath63 ) .    as a consistency check for the expression of @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> , one can find an alternative representation , obtained by expressing @xmath78 , which appears as a common factor in the expressions for @xmath54 , as a series : @xmath79 as a result , and after some algebra , we obtain : @xmath80 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which may naturally be thought of as an mre representation of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to pinpoint also here the part of the propagator that control its uv behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> since all the terms in the sum can be written as functions of @xmath64 , it is quite straightforward to see that the terms that control the large-@xmath81 regime are : @xmath82 ( for @xmath69 or @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 ( for @xmath85 ) .    to obtain a more explicit expression for @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> we insert the results derived previously for @xmath31 into ( [ eq : pimn ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we first note that , since @xmath5 shall also be a function of , we may write its fourier transform with respect to the parallel variables , as follows : @xmath86 \\;.\\ ] ] thus , @xmath87 where : @xmath88 \\;,\\ ] ] @xmath89 \\;,\\ ] ] @xmath90 \\;,\\ ] ] @xmath91 \\;.\\ ] ] inserting the explicit expressions for @xmath41 and @xmath71 presented in the appendix , one sees , after evaluating the traces , that @xmath92 vanishes identically . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath93 where : @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    before evaluating the above for some particular cases , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a magnitude corresponding to a related effect : the boundary conditions at @xmath96 and @xmath4 do break the chiral symmetry of the ( massless ) unconfined theory . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative and local measure of that violation , based on the expectation value of a bilinear observable is the fermion condensate @xmath97 .    in terms of the fermion propagator </S>",

    "<S> it can also be shown that it tends to @xmath96 when @xmath108 and @xmath35 is far from the borders . </S>",
    "<S> this concentration around the boundaries does also show up in the calculation of the induced vacuum current , @xmath109 , resulting from some special electromagnetic field configurations . </S>",

    "<S> this corresponds to @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is a constant . in the @xmath115 gauge : @xmath116 , and @xmath117 for @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath119 and its usually more convenient real - time ( minkowski ) version , @xmath120 , becomes : @xmath121 and , ( with @xmath122 ) : @xmath123 since the system is parity conserving , @xmath124 for this external field . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we concentrate on @xmath125 and @xmath126 . recalling ( [ eq : pilu ] ) , we see that these currents receive two contributions : @xmath127 \\,y_3   \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and analogously for @xmath126 .    to otain @xmath125 , we note first that : @xmath128 which is finite for all @xmath70 . a divergence </S>",
