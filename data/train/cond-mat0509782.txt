    "heterostructures made of superconducting ( sc ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) pieces not only give rich physical effects that are not observed in individual subsystems , but also offer new devices that can be tuned by weak magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "one of the realizations of such heterostructures is ferromagnetic / suprconducting bilayer ( fsb ) .",
    "earlier lyuksyutov and pokrovsky noticed @xcite that in a bilayer consisting of homogeneous sc and fm films with the magnetization normal to the plane , sc vortices occur spontaneously in the ground state , even though the magnet does not generate a magnetic field in the sc film .    in previous work",
    ", we presented a theory of such vortex - generation instability and the resulting vortex structures @xcite .",
    "we showed that due to this instability , domains with alternating magnetization and vortex directions occur in fsb . in that study , we treated these domain structures in the continuum regime in which the domain size is much larger than the effective penetration depth , which is defined to be @xmath1 , where the london penetration depth @xmath2 is much larger than the thickness of superconducting film @xmath3 @xcite . under the continuum aproximation , we found that the energy of stripe phase was minimal .",
    "the equilibrium domain size and the equilibrium energy for the stripe structure was found as @xcite    @xmath4    @xmath5    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is self - energy of a vortex , @xmath8 is domain wall energy per domain wall length,@xmath9 is the domain s area and @xmath10 is the euler - mascheroni constant . if @xmath11 , the continuum approximation becomes invalid , since @xmath12 becomes on the order of or less than @xmath0 ( see eq.([l - eq - stripe ] ) ) .",
    "however , it can be recovered by considering the discrete lattice of vortices instead .    in this paper , we study the discrete latice of vortices in stripe domain structures in fsb via a method based on london - maxwell equations , which is developed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the extension of the method to periodic systems is also introduced for the case of square magnetic dot arrays on a sc film @xcite . here",
    "we adapt it for the discrete vortex lattices in sc / fm bilayers . in doing so",
    ", we assume that vortices and antivortices sit periodically on chains in the alternating domains of magnetization and vorticity .",
    "the problems we consider here are ; i ) how the vortices and the antivortices are positioned on the chains ; ii ) how the equilibrium domain size changes , depending on the magnetization and the magnetic domain wall energy in the presence of the vortices ; iii ) if the spontaneous appearence of domains structures with different number of vortex chains is possible . in order to solve these problems , we first propose five different configurations of the vortex and the antivortex chains , in which at most two chains per stripe is considered .",
    "next , we calculate their equilibrium energies by means of numerical methods and find the most favorable case among them .",
    "our calculations show that in equilibrium structure , vortex chains are half shifted in the adjacent domain while they are next to each other in the same domains .",
    "inspired from this result , similar configuration for three vortex chains per domain is considered , and its equilibrium energy is calculated for various values of magnetization and domain wall energy .",
    "comparison of equilibrium energies of cases with one , two and three chains per domains shows that at lower values of magnetization and domain wall energy case with two chains is favorable whereas , three chain cases wins at higher values of magnetization and domain wall energy .",
    "additionally , single chain case does not win over the ones with two and three chains per domain under any circumstances .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the following section , we present the method for discrete case and its application to configurations with a single and double vortex chains per domain . in the third section ,",
    "we briefly present our results on the proposed five configurations .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to the study of the case with three chains per domain .",
    "the last section consists of the conclusions and discussion . in the appendix",
    ", we give the details of the methods and mathematical tricks in series calculations .",
    "in this section , we introduce a method based on the treatment of vortices in the discrete lattice .",
    "we study the lattices of discrete vortices only in the stripe phase . in the continuum approximation",
    ", it is found that the vortex density increases at the closer distances to the magnetic domain walls .",
    "based on this fact and the symmetry of the stripe domain structure , it is reasonable to consider that the vortices and antivortices form periodic structures on straight chains along the @xmath13 direction . even though it is not clear how many chains",
    "are associated with each domain , we can still make progress toward understanding discrete vortex lattices . to this end , five stripe domain configurations in which vortices are situated periodically on chains are proposed . from this point on ,",
    "the configurations with @xmath14 vortex chains per stripe domain are labeled as @xmath14 state .    in two of proposed cases , there is one chain per stripe ( @xmath15 states ) , located in the middle of the domain . in this case , two configurations of vortex lattice are possible ; first , the vortices and the antivortices in a neighboring domains are alongside to one another ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1stcase ] ) , second , they are shifted by half period @xmath16 along the @xmath13 direction , where @xmath17 is the distance between two nearest vortices on the chain ( see fig . [ fig:2ndcase ] ) .",

    "the possible situations in the two chain cases are as follows ; first , chains in the same domains are shifted by a half period @xmath16 along @xmath13 direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3rdcasea ] ) .",
    "however , the neighbor vortices and antivortices are next to each other .",
    "second , they are just shifted by a half period @xmath16 ( see fig . [ fig:4thcase ] ) .",
    "third , the vortices and the antivortices are simply side by side on the chains ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5thcase ] ) .",
    "our next step is to write the energies of these five candidates . to this end",
    ", we use the energy equations for periodic systems developed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 , where the @xmath21 s are the reciprocal vectors of the periodic structures , the @xmath22 are the positions of the vortex centers , and @xmath23 are the charge of the vortex . in our proposed models , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "[ tabf ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     2    as seen from table.[comp ] , at low magnetization and small domain wall energies , @xmath18 state is energetically favorable .",
    "however , @xmath26 state wins over at high values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this picture resembles the one we see in the case of magnetic dots on a sc film . in that case",
    ", the further increase in @xmath27 and the dot s size makes other vortex states more energetically favorable @xcite . here",
    ", the domain s size is also controlled by domain wall energy .",
    "therefore , the larger the @xmath28 , the larger the domain size . as a result ,",
    "new chain states might be more energetically favorable . in @xmath26 state ,",
    "how the equilibrium domain size , vortex - vortex distance on the chain , and vortex chain - domain wall distance change according to different values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are shown in figs.[3coll],[3colb],[3cola ] .",
    "as seen in these figures @xmath29,@xmath30 and @xmath31 follow the same pattern as that of @xmath15 and @xmath18 states .",
    "as number of chains per domain increases , @xmath29,@xmath30 and @xmath31 increase .",
    "in addition to equilibrium energies , equilibrium unit cell areas and vortex densities of unit cells for @xmath15 , @xmath18 and @xmath26 states are given in table.[comp ] . at fixed @xmath32",
    ", unit cell area expands with further increase of @xmath28 .",

    "on the other hand , unit cell area expands with more more vortex chains at fixed values of @xmath33 and @xmath28 except , unit cell areal of @xmath15 state is larger than those of @xmath18 and @xmath26 states , when @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we think that @xmath15 state in this case is energetically very close to instable region in which there is monodomain only .",
    "furthermore , from our results , we expect that the most energetically favorable state has the highest vortex density .     versus @xmath36 for @xmath26 state .",

    "in this article , we reported our results on the lattices of discrete vortices in stripe domains in fsb based on a method based on maxwell - london equations . if @xmath11 , the continuum approximation becomes invalid . instead , we considered the discrete lattice of vortices in which the vortices were considered to be situated on chains directed along the stripes .",
    "we first analyzed the vortex configurations up to two vortex chains .",
    "depending on the magnetization and the magnetic domain wall energy , the equilibrium energy , the positions of the vortices and the equilbrium domain size are calculated . according to our calculations , in equilibrium , vortices on the either side of the magnetic domain walls are not side by side on the chains ;",
    "instead , they are shifted by a half period along the stripe , while they are side by side in the same domain .",
    "we also checked whether different vortex chain states can be energetically favorable . to do so , we calculated the equilibrium energy for @xmath26 state whose equilibrium configuration was assumed to be the superposition of those for @xmath15 and @xmath18 states .",
    "the comporison of energies implies that more vortex chains can emerge spontanously in the larger domains .    in numerical calculations",
    ", we also found that the vortex lattice is stable for @xmath39 . at this point ,",
    "the domain size is noticably larger than the effective penetration depth @xmath0 , so the continuum approximation is valid .",
    "therefore , we expect that the domain nucleation starts in the continuum regime .",
