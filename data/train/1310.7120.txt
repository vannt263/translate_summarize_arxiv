    "given the ( noisy ) channel output along with his side information , bob must be able to deduce alice s message with zero probability of error ( we always require zero error throughout this entire paper ) .",

    "@xmath16 is the infimum of @xmath17 over all @xmath13-coding schemes .",

    "on the other hand , communication over a perfect channel with side information was considered by witsenhausen  @xcite ; the corresponding cost rate is known as the _ witsenhausen rate_. the general problem , with both side information and a noisy channel , was considered by nayak , tuncel , and rose  @xcite .",
    "the shannon capacity of a channel is very difficult to compute , and is not even known to be decidable .",
    "however , a useful upper bound on shannon capacity is provided by the @xmath3 number introduced by lovsz  @xcite .",
    "the lovsz @xmath3 number also provides a lower bound on the witsenhausen rate  @xcite and , in general , the cost rate .",
    "recently it has been of interest to study a version of this problem in which the parties may make use of an entangled quantum state , which can in certain cases increase the zero - error capacity of a classical channel  @xcite .",
    "the lovsz @xmath3 number upper bounds entanglement assisted shannon capacity , just as it does classical shannon capacity  @xcite .",
    "beigi s proof  @xcite proceeds through a relaxation of the channel coding problem , with the relaxed constraints consisting of various orthogonality conditions imposed upon a set of vectors .",
    "we study a relaxation of the entanglement assisted source - channel coding problem inspired by this technique of beigi .",
    "this relaxation leads to a set of constraints that are exactly characterized by monotonicity of @xmath3 .",
    "this has a number of consequences .",
    "beigi defined a function @xmath7 as an upper bound on entanglement assisted independence number and posed the question of whether @xmath7 is equal to @xmath19 .",
    "we answer this in the affirmative and show that a similarly defined quantity is equal to @xmath20 .",
    "we show that @xmath3 provides a bound for the source - channel coding problem . as a special case this reproduces both beigi s result as well as that of brit et al .",

    "a slightly different relaxation of source - channel coding leads to three necessary conditions for the existence of a @xmath21-coding scheme in terms of @xmath3 and two variants : schrijver s @xmath4 and szegedy s @xmath5 .",

    "in particular , we produce a tighter bound on the entanglement assisted independence number : @xmath22 .    the technical results , [ thm : th_homb , thm : th_homp ] , should be accessible to the reader who is familiar with graph theory but not information theory or quantum mechanics , which merely provide a motivation for the problem .",
    "we will make use of the following graph theoretical concepts . a _ graph _ @xmath0 consists of a set of _ vertices _ @xmath23 along with a symmetric binary relation @xmath24 among vertices ( we abbreviate @xmath25 when the graph can be inferred from context ) .",

    "the _ complement _ of a graph @xmath0 , denoted @xmath31 , has the same set of vertices but has edges between distinct pairs of vertices which are not adjacent in @xmath0 ( i.e.  for @xmath32 we have @xmath33 ) .",
    "a set of vertices no two of which form an edge is known as an _ independent set _ ; the size of the largest independent set is the _ independence number _ @xmath34 .",
    "a set of vertices such that every pair is adjacent is known as a _ clique _ ; the size of the largest clique is the _ clique number _ @xmath35 .",
    "clearly @xmath36 . an assignment of colors to vertices such that adjacent vertices are given distinct colors",
    "is called a _ proper coloring _ ; the minimum number of colors needed is the _ chromatic number _ @xmath37 .",
    "a function mapping the vertices of one graph to those of another , @xmath38 , is a _ homomorphism _ if @xmath39 .",

    "many other graph properties can be expressed in terms of homomorphisms ; for details see  @xcite .",
    "the _ strong product _ of two graphs , @xmath45 , has vertex set @xmath46 and has edges @xmath47 the @xmath15-fold strong product is written @xmath48 .",

    "therefore , alice s set of codewords must form a clique of @xmath1 ; the size of the largest such set is the clique number @xmath61 .",
    "we will call this the _ distinguishability graph _ of @xmath55 . the complementary graph @xmath62 is known as the _ confusability graph _ of @xmath55 . note that standard convention is to denote the confusability graph by @xmath1 rather than @xmath62 .",
    "we break convention in order to make notation in this paper much simpler .",

    "the number of bits ( the base-2 log of the number of distinct codewords ) that alice can send with a single use of @xmath55 is known as the _ one - shot zero - error capacity _ of @xmath55 , and is equal to @xmath64 .",
    "the average number of bits that can be sent per channel use ( again with zero error ) in the limit of many uses of a channel is known as the _ shannon capacity_. with @xmath15 parallel uses of @xmath55 the distinguishability graph is @xmath65 .",
    "the shannon capacity of @xmath55 is therefore @xmath66    this quantity is in general very difficult to compute , with the capacity of the five cycle graph @xmath67 having been open for over 20 years and the capacity of @xmath68 being unknown to this day .",
    "the capacity of @xmath69 was solved by lovsz  @xcite who introduced a function @xmath70 , the definition of which will be postponed until [ sec : mainthms ] .",

    "<S> we study zero - error entanglement assisted source - channel coding ( communication in the presence of side information ) . adapting a technique of beigi </S>",
    "<S> , we show that such coding requires existence of a set of vectors satisfying orthogonality conditions related to suitably defined graphs @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> such vectors exist if and only if @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the lovsz number . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain similar inequalities for the related schrijver @xmath4 and szegedy @xmath5 numbers .    </S>",
    "<S> these inequalities reproduce several known bounds and also lead to new results . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a lower bound on the entanglement assisted cost rate . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the entanglement assisted independence number is bounded by the schrijver number : @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we are able to disprove the conjecture that the one - shot entanglement - assisted zero - error capacity is equal to the integer part of the lovsz number . </S>",
    "<S> beigi introduced a quantity @xmath7 as an upper bound on @xmath8 and posed the question of whether @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we answer this in the affirmative and show that a related quantity is equal to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a quantity @xmath11 recently introduced in the context of tsirelson s problem is equal to @xmath12 .    in an appendix </S>",
    "<S> we investigate multiplicativity properties of schrijver s and szegedy s numbers , as well as projective rank .    </S>",
