    "relaxation is the most fundamental process in evolution of many - body system .",
    "the classical statistical theory is based on ergodic property , which is considered to be established after relaxation .",
    "however , not all systems do not show such an idealistic relaxation .",
    "a historical example is fpu ( fermi - pasta - ulam ) problem@xcite , which experiences the induction phenomenon ( e.g. , ref@xcite ) and does not relax to the equipartition for very long time .    from nearly thirty years of investigation , one - dimensional self - gravitating sheet systems ( ogs )",
    "have been known by their strange behavior in evolution .",
    "hohl@xcite first asserted that ogs relaxes to the thermodynamical equilibrium ( the isothermal distribution ) in a time scale of about @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of sheets , and @xmath3 is typical time for a sheet to cross the system .",
    "later , more precise numerical experiments determined that the hohl s result was not right , and then arguments for the relaxation time arose in 1980 s .",
    "a belgian group@xcite claimed the ogs relaxed in shorter than @xmath4 , whereas a texas group@xcite showed that the system showed long lived correlation and never relaxed even after @xmath5 .",
    "tsuchiya , gouda and konishi ( 1996)@xcite suggested that this contradiction can be resolved in the view of two different types of relaxations : the _ microscopic _ and the _ macroscopic _ relaxations . at the time scale of @xmath4 , cumulative effect of the mean field fluctuation makes the energies of the individual particles change noticeably .",
    "averaging this change gives the equipartition of energies , thus there is a relaxation at this time scale . by this relaxation",
    "the system is led not to the thermal equilibrium but only to a quasiequilibrium .",
    "the global shape of the one - body distribution remains different from that of the thermal equilibrium .",
    "this relaxation appears only in the microscopic dynamics , thus it is called the microscopic relaxation .",
    "the global shape of the one - body distribution transforms in much longer time scale .",
    "for example , a quasiequilibrium ( the water - bag distribution , which has the longest life time ) begins to transform at @xmath6 in average .",
    "tsuchiya et al.(1996 ) @xcite called this transformation the macroscopic relaxation , but later in tsuchiya , gouda and konishi ( 1998 ) @xcite , it is shown that this transformation is onset of the _ itinerant stage_. in this stage , the one - body distribution stays in a quasiequilibrium for some time and then changes to other quasiequilibrium .",
    "this transformation continues forever .",
    "probability density of the life time of the quasiequilibria has a power law distribution with a long time cut - off and the longest life time is @xmath7 . only by averaging over a time longer than the longest life time of the quasiequilibria , the one - body distribution becomes that of the thermal equilibrium , which is defined as the maximum entropy state .",
    "therefore the time @xmath8 is necessary for relaxation to the thermal equilibrium , and called the _ thermal relaxation time_. although there are some attempts to clarify the mechanisms of these relaxations @xcite , the reason why the system does not relax for such a long time is still unclear .    at the view of chaotic theory of dynamical systems ,",
    "relaxation is understood as mixing in phase space , and its time scale is given by the kolmogorov - sinai time ( ks time ) , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the kolmogorov - sinai entropy .",
    "however , it does not simply correspond to the relaxation of the one - body distribution function , which is of interest in many - body systems . recently",
    ", dellago and posch@xcite showed that in a hard sphere gas , the ks time equals the mixing time of neighboring orbits in the phase space , whereas the relaxation of the one - body distribution function corresponds to the collision time between particles .",
    "now , it is fruitful to study relation between relaxation and some dynamical quantities , such as the ks entropy and the lyapunov exponents , in the ogs .",
    "milanovi et al.@xcite showed the lyapunov spectrum and the kolmogorov - sinai entropy in the ogs for @xmath11 .",
    "however , since it is known that the chaotic behavior changes for @xmath12 for the ogs@xcite , it is considerably important to extend the analysis to the system larger than @xmath12 . in this paper , we extend the number of sheets to @xmath13 and follow the evolution numerically up to @xmath14 , which is long enough for the thermal relaxation @xcite .",
    "the ogs comprises @xmath2 identical plane - parallel mass sheets , each of which has uniform mass density and infinite in , say , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 direction .",
    "they move only in the @xmath17 direction under their mutual gravity .",
    "when two of the sheets intersect , they pass through each other .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system has the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the mass ( surface density ) , velocity , and position of the @xmath22th sheet , respectively .",
    "since the gravitational field is uniform , the individual particles moves parabolically , until they intersect with the neighbors . thus the evolution of the system can be followed by solving quadratic equations .",
    "this property helps us to calculate long time evolution with a high accuracy . since length and velocity ( thus also energy )",
    "can be scaled in the system , the number of the sheets @xmath2 is the only free parameter . the crossing time is defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the total mass and total energy of the system .",
    "detailed descriptions of the evolution of the ogs can be found in our previous papers@xcite .    in order to investigate dynamical aspects of the system",
    ", we calculated the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "the basic numerical algorithm follows shimada and nagashima@xcite , and detailed description of the procedure for the ogs can be found in ref@xcite .",
    "we made numerical integration for @xmath26 up to @xmath27 , which is enough time for the system to relax , and up to @xmath28 for @xmath13 for reference .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum ] shows the spectrum of the lyapunov exponents , @xmath29 , where their unit is @xmath30 . this figure is the same diagram as fig . 6 in milanovi",
    "et al@xcite , but the range of @xmath2 is extended to @xmath31 . in the horizontal axis , @xmath32 is the index of the lyapunov exponents , which is labeled in the order from the maximum to the minimum .",
    "thus all the positive lyapunov exponents @xmath33 is scaled between 0 to 1 in the axis .",
    "the vertical axis shows the lyapunov exponents normalized by the maximum lyapunov exponents , @xmath34 .",
    "milanovi et al@xcite stated that the shape of the spectrum approximately converges for large @xmath2.a closer look , however , shows bending of the spectrum , which is most clearly seen at @xmath35 .",
    "this bending seems increase with @xmath2 for @xmath36 .",
    "a further investigation is needed to give a definite conclusion about the convergence of the shape of the spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : ndependence ] shows @xmath2-dependence of the maximum @xmath37 , the minimum positive lyapunov exponent @xmath38 , and the ks entropy @xmath39 per the number of freedom .",
    "@xmath34 is already shown in fig.13 in tsuchiya et al.@xcite , and it is proportional to @xmath0 for @xmath36 . decreasing nature of the lyapunov exponent may indicate that the ogs approaches closer to an integrable system for larger @xmath2 .    as expected from the spectrum",
    "the ks entropy divided by @xmath2 is also proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the conjecture by benettin et al.@xcite that @xmath39 increases linearly with @xmath2 is not right .",
    "it is clear that the inverses of both the maximum lyapunove exponents and the ks entropy do not give the time scale of any type of relaxation time .",
    "the @xmath2-dependence of small positive lyapunov exponents are quite different from larger ones . in fig.[fig : ndependence ] , the minimum positive lyapunov exponent , @xmath40 , is shown by a dashed dotted line with the symbol @xmath41 .",
    "it decreases linearly for @xmath36 , and its time scale @xmath42 is about the same as the microscopic relaxation time ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the eigen vectors for the lyapunov exponents also give a useful information .",
    "figure [ fig : lyapvec ] shows projection of the eigen vector for @xmath44 on to the one - body phase space .",
    "filled circles indicate positions of @xmath2 sheets at a moment and the arrows give the direction of the lyapunov eigen vector , which grows with the rate of the lyapunov exponent . fig [ fig : lyapvec](a ) is for the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath34 , and fig.[fig : lyapvec](b ) is for the minimum positive one , @xmath40 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the instability is carried only by a few particles , which are interacting in a very small region .",
    "the instability is thus not for global transformation . on the other hand",
    ", the instability with @xmath40 makes all particles mix in the phase space .",
    "this is the very effect of relaxation .",
    "these features are commonly seen for different @xmath2 .",
    "the results that the coincidence of the @xmath42 and the microscopic relaxation time , and the direction of the eigen vector , may be suggesting that the microscopic relaxation time is determined by the growing time of the weakest instability , which is determined by the minimum positive lyapunov exponent ; in other words , this time is necessary for the phase space orbit to mix in the phase space in the all directions of freedom . in our working model of the evolution of the ogs@xcite , the phase space is derived by some barriers which keep the phase orbit inside for a long time .",
    "the microscopic relaxation is considered to be a diffusion process in the barierred region@xcite , and in the time @xmath43 , restricted ergodicity is established within the barierred region .",
    "this time may correspond to the diffusion time in the slowest direction .",
    "in the ergodic theory , the ks time represents the time scale of `` mixing '' in the phase space . on the other hand ,",
    "the relaxation of the one - body distribution is of the most interest in systems with large degrees of freedom .",
    "we have shown that the time scale of the relaxation of one - body distribution ( both the microscopic and thermal relaxation ) is certainly different from that of the ks time , and found that the growing time of the weakest lyapunov instability is about the same as the microscopic relaxation time .",
    "in addition , taking into account the direction of the eigen vector of the weakest lyapunov exponent , it is suggested that the microscopic relaxation is determined by the weakest lyapunov instability .",
    "the ks entropy is defined as a typical time for the system to increase `` information '' .",
    "this definition does not depend on the number of degrees of freedom . in higher dimensions ,",
    "however , even very small growth of instability can increase information quite rapidly .",
    "therefore the ks time does not seem suitable to characterize the relaxation of the one - body distribution function .",
    "the relaxation of the one - body distribution function implies ergodicity . to attain ergodicity",
    ", the phase space orbits should diffuse over all accessible phase space . for the microscopic relaxation , even though it is not true thermal relaxation , the system shows ergodicity which is restricted in a part of the phase space@xcite .",
    "therefore it seems natural that the microscopic relaxation time is characterized by the slowest time of diffusion .",
    "that may be the reason that the inverse of the minimum positive lyapunov exponent coincides the microscopic relaxation time .",
    "gurzadyan and savvidy@xcite derived the ks time in the usual three dimensional stellar systems , which was found to be proportional to @xmath45 , by the method of the geodesic deviation .",
    "they asserted that the system relaxes in this time scale .",
    "this result was not supported by numerical simulations@xcite and by a semi - analytical study@xcite .",
    "our analysis of one - dimensional systems also gives negative result for the conjecture of gurzadyan and savvidy . according to our results",
    ", the time scale of the minimum positive lyapunov exponent would be related to the relaxation also in three - dimensional systems , though it is difficult to show it numerically .",
    "we have found that the ks time and any of the times of lyapunov instabilities do not give the thermal relaxation time in the ogs . in our working model ,",
    "the thermal relaxation is the successive transitions of the phase space orbit among the barierred regions .",
    "the each region has locally restricted ergodicity , hence the long time average could only give average of the lyapunov exponents , which are defined in each region , and it is reasonable that the averaged lyapunov exponents do not characterize the thermal relaxation .",
    "actual time of the thermal relaxation is that of transition among quasiequilibria .",
    "it is necessary to find appropriate dynamical quantities to describe it .",
    "the authors are grateful to t. konishi for many critical suggestions .",
    "we also thank b. n. miller and y. aizawa for valuable discussions . this work was supported in part by jsps research fellow and in part by the grant - in - aid for scientific research(no.10640229)from the ministry of education , science , sports and culture of japan ."
