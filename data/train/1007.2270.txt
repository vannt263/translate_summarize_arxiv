    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) structures formed by micron - sized colloidal particles trapped at fluid interfaces have received a significant attention since an interfacial colloidal crystal has been first observed by pieranski in 1980  @xcite . in the last two decades 2d - colloidal structures have proven to be an excellent model system for studying the influences of dimensionality and confinement on phase transitions .",
    "for example , a general scenario for 2d - melting , predicted by kosterlitz and thouless  @xcite in 1973 , has been directly verified in experiments using quasi-2d colloidal structures  @xcite .",
    "it has also been found that strong lateral confinement can lead to peculiarities like reentrant freezing  @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the capillary interactions between colloidal particles mediated by a fluid interface resemble 2d - electrostatics , which is due to the fact that the small deformations of the interface are governed by the poisson equation with the pressure field playing the role of a two - dimensional charge density . in terms of application perspectives",
    ", controlling self - assembly  @xcite and structure formation  @xcite at fluid interfaces provides tools for the engineering of advanced materials based on transferring such microstructures onto solid substrates  @xcite .",
    "colloidal particles are also known to stabilize emulsions by self - assembling at the droplet surfaces  @xcite , creating capsules which might have potential use in medicine  @xcite .",
    "the particles at droplet surfaces can also be used to study correlations  @xcite , topological defects , and the generalized thomson problem for optimal packing on a sphere  @xcite .",
    "the presence of an interface strongly modifies the effective interactions between colloidal particles as compared with their counterparts in the bulk .",
    "it has been already noted by pieranski  @xcite , that in the generic case of different dielectric constants of the adjacent fluids , the interface breaks the symmetry in the ion distribution around each particle , leading to an effective dipolar repulsion .",
    "therefore , in the presence of lateral confinement a 2d - crystal can form . however , in the last decade many authors reported on the spontaneous formation of mesostructures like clusters , stripes  @xcite , and freely floating crystallites  @xcite without confinement .",
    "these observations suggest more complicated forms of the effective interaction potentials , in particular the presence of an attraction , the origin of which has recently been intensively discussed in the literature .",
    "the interface mediated capillary interactions are considered to be promising candidates for an explanation , but their theoretical description is still in progress .",
    "the main idea , formulated already in 1949 by nicolson  @xcite , is that the surface energy of a deformed interface depends on the separation of the particles generating the deformation  @xcite .",
    "originally , nicolson studied the behavior of millimeter - sized bubbles deforming the interface due to their buoyancy . in the case of micrometer - sized or smaller particles gravity",
    "can be usually neglected , but even then capillary interactions can dominate thermal energies by orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "there seem to be at least two reasons for the origin of the interface deformation around the particles .",
    "first , in the case of charged colloidal particles pinned at the interface , an electrostatic pressure emerges due to the inhomogeneous ion distribution close to the interface  @xcite .",
    "second , the interface must deform in order to meet the particle surface at a given contact angle or at a prescribed ( pinned ) contact line , which becomes important in the cases of smooth non - spherical particles  @xcite or rough particles  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the case of charged particles has been strongly debated in the last few years and different theoretical approaches have lead to contradictory results for the form of the capillary interaction potential . in 2002",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite observed a freely floating hexagonal structure formed by charged particles at the surface of a water droplet in oil .",
    "the authors proposed a simple explanation according to which the particles are pulled towards the water phase by the electrostatic forces due to the different dielectric constants of water and oil .",
    "they concluded that the presence of such a pulling force leads to a logarithmically varying interface profile around a single particle and consequently to a logarithmically varying effective interaction potential between two particles .",
    "however , it was noted by megens _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite that this long - ranged interface deformation yields an unbalanced force acting on the rim of the vessel containing the liquid , which is inconsistent with newton s third law . instead , in the presence of the electrostatic pressure , decaying as @xmath1 with lateral distance @xmath2 from the particle , the latter authors concluded that the interaction potential should be attractive and should decay also like @xmath1 .",
    "a similar reasoning was presented by foret and wrger  @xcite , who obtained the same power law , but with opposite sign .",
    "their calculation was based on a regularization of the interface deformation field at @xmath3 and a superposition approximation for the electrostatic pressure in the presence of two particles .",
    "however , domnguez _ et al .",
    "_  noted  @xcite that the latter assumption is not correct because the electrostatic pressure , proportional to the electrostatic field squared , is not additive .",
    "instead , one should use the additivity of the electrostatic potential , which finally gives an attractive @xmath4 behavior .",
    "this leads to the conclusion , that the total interparticle potential including the direct dipolar electrostatic repulsion , governed also by the power law @xmath4 , can not exhibit a minimum , unless the screening length in water is comparable with the size of the particles .",
    "in such a case a shallow minimum with a depth of several @xmath5 could be expected  @xcite .",
    "however , its occurrence would depend sensitively on the precise values of several system parameters .    in yet another publication  @xcite , domnguez _ et al .",
    "_  suggested that the finite size of the system might be important for generating the long - ranged interactions .",
    "in fact , in the experiment reported by nikolaides _",
    "_ , the particles were trapped at the surface of a droplet pinned to a solid plate , but curvature and volume constraint were neglected in the theoretical description in ref .",
    "@xcite . for recent assessments of these capillary forces see refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite , and @xcite . in the present work",
    "we show that finite size effects indeed lead to effects not present in the case of a flat unbounded interface .",
    "quite generally , the presence of boundaries in a colloidal system can change the nature of the effective interactions .",
    "for example , the hydrodynamic interactions in the bulk decay like the inverse of the particle separation , but in the presence of one or two walls or of surfaces the decay exponent can change or there might be even a switch to a logarithmic law  @xcite . on the other hand , in one - dimensional channels the hydrodynamic interactions are screened and characterized by an exponential decay  @xcite .",
    "our ultimate objective is to study how curvature and confinement of the fluid interface affect the capillary interactions between the floating particles .",
    "the effects of curvature have been already studied by wrger  @xcite , but this description can not be regarded as complete as long as the consequences of force balance on the droplet have not been correctly resolved  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite kralchevsky _",
    "_  have provided numerical results for the free energy of particles protruding from a spherical liquid film and in some cases they observed a non - monotonic dependence of the ensuing effective interaction on the spatial distance between them , but the physical mechanism responsible for this effect has not been explained .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite derived the equation for the axisymmetric shape of a slightly deformed spherical droplet , taking into account the volume constraint and a certain type of boundary condition at the substrate .",
    "however , the influence of the type of boundary condition on the free energy and the occurrence of a possible confining capillary potential due to the presence of the substrate have not yet been discussed . in the following we aim at calculating such an effective potential and at providing some general instructions of how the finite size effects should be taken into account when discussing capillary interactions .    as a first step in understanding the interactions ,",

    "this situation is common in experiments with evaporating droplets due to the flux of liquid dragging the particles towards the contact line  @xcite .",
    "when the height of the interface in the liquid wedge reduces below the particle diameter the interface around the particle must deform .",
