    "in this document , we develop a new formulation of single - particle relativistic quantum mechanics . traditionally , the formulation of quantum mechanics proceeds via a set of postulates,@xcite which we do not find it necessary to repeat here .",
    "we do note , however , that the order , precise content , and even total number of quantum postulates , vary from one treatment to the next . this situation might be taken as an indication of the controversy or uncertainty that still exists  particularly around those postulates having to do with quantum measurement .",
    "the latter are especially nettlesome in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics  where , e.g. , it may not be entirely clear how to reconcile the `` instantaneous '' collapse of the wavefunction with subluminal propagation .",
    "on the other hand , the traditional quantum treatments all do agree on the first and most important postulate ",
    "that the state of a system be completely described by the quantum wavefunction , @xmath0 .",
    "the wavefunction has thus always enjoyed a hallowed status in quantum mechanical theories , despite much historical and ongoing disagreement about its precise interpretation or physical significance.@xcite even those `` alternative '' interpretations of quantum mechanics that dare to challenge the first postulate still tend to respect the supremacy of @xmath0 .",
    "an example would be bohmian mechanics,@xcite which adopts a hybrid ontology wherein it is the wavefunction _ plus _ a quantum trajectory , together , that are needed to completely specify the quantum state .",
    "for many physicists , it may be difficult to even conceive of a quantum theory that makes no direct or indirect recourse to wavefunctions ",
    "after all , @xmath0 , appears in every one of the five ( or six ) standard postulates .",
    "nevertheless , exactly just such a theory was recently formulated for non - relativistic quantum mechanics.@xcite    for a number of reasons , it makes sense to try to extend the previous work to the _ relativistic _ case . as presented in this document ,",
    "this goal is now also achieved  at least in the context of a single , spin - zero , massive , relativistic quantum particle , propagating on a flat minkowski spacetime , with no external fields .",
    "such a system might represent , e.g. , a single higgs boson particle  apropos to which , the recent news from cern@xcite is serving to stimulate demand for new and fresh approaches . in any case , generalizations for curved spacetimes , external fields , photons , particles with spin , multiple particles , etc .",
    ", together with detailed analyses of symmetry and stability properties , are planned for the future ( although for each such development , a varying degree of required effort is anticipated ) .    to be clear ,",
    "the present approach is _ not _ a quantum field theory ( qft ) , but rather , a conserved particle approach  in that sense , like the non - relativistic time - dependent  equation ( tdse ) . as a fundamental theory of relativistic quantum mechanics , it is safe to say that a particle - based strategy has been largely abandoned for many decades ( with some notable exceptions@xcite ) . of course , the reasons for this date back to the earliest attempts to `` relativize '' the tdse , starting with the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation in 1926.@xcite whereas the tdse is first order in time and second order in space , the kg equation ( which treats space and time on an equal footing ) is second order in both ",
    "wherein lies the source of most of its difficulties .",
    "in particular , this leads to : ( 1 ) negative energy solutions , as well as ( 2 ) negative ( indefinite ) probability densities.@xcite    in 1928 , dirac improved matters somewhat , with the development of his famous first order ( in both time and space ) but multi - component equation , describing spin @xmath1 particles.@xcite dirac effectively solved problem ( 2 ) , but not problem ( 1 ) . by 1934",
    "however , the `` real '' solution to both problems was hit upon ",
    ", second quantization , and the development of qft.@xcite though obviously serving us well in the ensuing decades , particularly for processes involving the creation / annihilation of particles , it can be argued that qft introduces as many problems as it solves ( e.g. , pertaining to causality@xcite as well as renormalization ) , and in any event greatly complicates matters , both theoretically and conceptually .",
    "presumably , a viable , rigorous , single - particle theory of relativistic quantum mechanics would therefore still be welcomed with open arms .",
    "the time is now ripe to revisit this notion .",
    "what makes us imagine that we can succeed where klein , gordon , and dirac evidently failed ?",
    "the crucial development is the recent wavefunction - free reformulation of non - relativistic quantum mechanics , alluded to above.@xcite this approach is trajectory based , and in that sense reminiscent of bohmian mechanics . unlike the bohm theory , however , here , the traditional wavefunction , @xmath2 , is entirely done away with , in favor of the _ trajectory ensemble _ , @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 labels individual trajectories ) as the fundamental representation of a quantum state .",
    "the ensemble is such that there is exactly one trajectory passing through every point in space ( @xmath5 ) at any given point in time ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the ensemble satisfies its own partial differential equation ( pde ) that is mathematically equivalent to the tdse  even though it is nonlinear , real valued , second order in @xmath6 and fourth order in @xmath4",
    ". it also satisfies an action principle , for which the lagrangian consists of the usual classical part , plus a quantum contribution that incorporates _ intertrajectory interactions _",
    "( i.e. , partial derivatives of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath4 ) .    from the perspective of developing a relativistic generalization of quantum theory , the trajectory - based approach is extremely well suited to the task . as in standard relativity theory ( and non - relativistic classical mechanics ) , quantum solution trajectories are obtained as those that extremize the appropriate quantum action quantity  whose relativistic form may be guessed as the lorentz - invariant ( or generally covariant ) version of the non - relativistic quantum action described above . as in relativity theory , also , the quantum solution trajectory pdes are inherently nonlinear .",
    "although in the non - relativistic case , these happen to be equivalent to a linear wave pde ( i.e. , the tdse for @xmath0 ) , there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect such a relationship to hold in the relativistic case . indeed ,",
    "if a viable ( i.e. , non - kg ) relativistic linear wave pde describing individual quantum particles were possible , then it probably would have been discovered decades ago by one of the aforementioned luminaries ...    at any rate , in this work we develop a relativistic generalization of our earlier non - relativistic trajectory - ensemble - based theory for quantum particles .",
    "it must be emphasized that _ new physics is being predicted here_which , in principle , could be validated or refuted by comparison with experiment . because we are operating largely in uncharted waters , it is possible that the present form of our equations may have to be modified ( as was famously the case with einstein s own equations ) ; at the same time , however , general covariance considerations _ greatly _ restrict the form that such alternate dynamical laws might take . in any event ,",
    "the form presented here is likely the simplest and most reasonable .",
    "we note that although only special relativity ( sr ) _ per se _ is considered here , the mathematical development of our approach relies heavily on curvilinear coordinate systems  and therefore , on the framework and tools of general relativity ( gr).@xcite    central to our approach is our ( evidently ) new definition of _",
    "simultaneity for accelerated particles .",
    "_ even in sr , there is no good notion of the set of all spacetime events that occur simultaneously ( from the particle s perspective ) with a given event on the particle s worldline , if it is accelerating . in this",
    "context , simultaneity is sometimes defined in the usual unaccelerated manner  i.e .",
    ", using local inertial or comoving frames.@xcite this strategy fundamentally fails , however , because it predicts multiple reoccurrences of the same spacetime events ( e.g. pivot points@xcite ) , as well as the incorrect time ordering for distant , timelike separated events .",
    "quite remarkably , the present , trajectory ensemble approach allows for a natural and rigorous generalization of the simultaneity concept for an arbitrarily - moving particle  essentially , because the quantum nature of the particle imparts a global character to it .",
    "the new relativistic quantum trajectory pdes can be analyzed in various ways . in inertial coordinates ,",
    "one obtains a form that is similar to the kg equation  yet differs in one very crucial respect ( discussed in sec .",
    "in retrospect , from a trajectory ensemble vantage , one can see clearly exactly where kg `` got the physics wrong , '' in their attempt to relativize the tdse .",
    "however , in order to do so , one must transform from the inertial frame to a certain curvilinear ( albeit naturally arising ) coordinate system , in terms of which the new pdes are fourth order in space , and only _ second _ order in time ( i.e. , just like the non - relativistic quantum trajectory pdes ) .",
    "the ramifications of this  and more generally , of the apparent inherent nonlinearity of the new pdes  are not yet entirely clear .",
    "thus , it may turn out that the present form is not always stable ( or that other unanticipated problems may eventually manifest)although instability has not yet been observed , e.g. , in the examples considered in sec .",
    "[ examples ] .",
    "however , if such difficulties were to arise in the future , the author s view is that it should serve as a call to arms to look for a suitable rectifying modification of the present formulation  rather than as a condemnation of the general approach presented here , which seems to have much to offer .",
    "this document is quite long and comprehensive , as the requisite formal development is rather involved .",
    "we thus provide here a detailed overview of the remaining sections , with a specification of those subsections that might be skipped on an initial reading .",

    "note that we adopt the -+++ convention for the metric signature ; also , factors of @xmath13 are always explicitly indicated .",
    "thus , the line element @xmath14 has units of length squared , whereas the proper time , @xmath15 , defined via d^2 = - 1 c^2 _ dx^dx^ , [ dtaudef ] has units of time .",

    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , run over the four spacetime inertial coordinate labels , i.e. 0,1,2,3 , whereas @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 serve a similar function for general curvilinear coordinate systems ( denoted @xmath24 ) .",
    "latin indices run over spatial ( or spacelike ) coordinate labels 1,2,3 , as per usual , with @xmath25 , @xmath9 ( not to be confused with mass ) used for inertial coordinates , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for general coordinates .",
    "a _ path ensemble _ ( candidate solution trajectory ensemble ) is uniquely specified via a contravariant vector field @xmath29 ( in inertial coordinates ) , satisfying _ u^u^= - c^2 [ fourvcond ] everywhere .",
    "equation  ( [ fourvcond ] ) above implies that @xmath29 is everywhere timelike , and may be interpreted as a four - velocity field , i.e. u^= d x^d .",
    "[ fourv ] integration of then gives rise to a set of 1d submanifolds that foliate @xmath8 , and therefore do not cross ( even self - intersections are prohibited by the topology ; the submanifolds are inextendible ) .",
    "this family of timelike curves thus constitutes the ensemble of paths , or candidate solution trajectories .",
    "there is exactly one path passing through every point @xmath30 in @xmath8 ; also , a one - to - one correspondence exists between paths ( whose codimension is 3 ) and spatial points ( the set @xmath7 for fixed @xmath6 ) .",
    "moreover , all of the above properties are preserved under lorentz transformations of the inertial frame , i.e. x^x^ = ^ _ x^. [ lt ] specifically the transformed four - velocity field , @xmath31 , satisfies primed versions of , and a correspondence can be established between paths and @xmath32 points , for fixed @xmath33 .",
    "we next introduce a set of _ path labeling parameters _ , @xmath34 , which uniquely identify individual paths within the ensemble .",
    "the @xmath35 are not yet coordinates per se , although later we will construct curvilinear coordinate systems from them . note that the @xmath35 values do not change under lorentz transformations . since the labeling parameters can ( but in general will not ) be identified with @xmath7 at some specific @xmath6 ( for some specific inertial frame ) , we regard the @xmath35 as spacelike parameters . in any event , for a given path ensemble and choice of inertial frame , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are well - defined inverse diffeomorphisms of each other , for fixed values of @xmath6 .",
    "note that the above claims are subject to certain caveats , such as the possible existence of a measure - zero set of exception points.@xcite      consider the tangent space @xmath38 for a point @xmath30 in @xmath8 .",
    "a 3d spacelike `` orthogonal subspace '' can be defined as the set of all vectors @xmath39 in @xmath38 that are orthogonal to @xmath29 : _",
    "u^ w^= 0 [ orthosub ] the orthogonal subspace is a linear vector space in its own right ; the collection of all such subspaces for every point @xmath30 in @xmath8 forms a subbundle .",
    "we presume that the orthogonal subspaces can be integrated outward from the point @xmath30 , to construct a corresponding integral submanifold .",
    "specifically , this is a 3d embedded submanifold of @xmath8 , a spacelike hypersurface , that intersects every path exactly once . by starting this procedure from each point",
    "@xmath30 that lies along a particular reference path , a one - parameter family of such hypersurfaces may be constructed , which are non - intersecting , and otherwise foliate @xmath8 . by construction , at every point @xmath30 in @xmath8 , the four - velocity vector @xmath29 is normal to the hypersurface passing through that point .",
    "we hereby refer to the above 3d hypersurfaces as `` simultaneity submanifolds . ''",
    "this terminology is justified through the following physical arguments .",
    "consider a particle on a worldline passing through event @xmath30 . at that instant ,",
    "the velocity four - vector @xmath29 defines the local forward time direction for that particle .",
    "likewise , the orthogonal subspace defines the local spacelike directions for that particle  that is to say , the local set of events that occur simultaneously with @xmath30 , from the particle s perspective .",
    "this much , at least , is consistent with the idea of local inertial frames , and more importantly , with the einstein equivalence principle.@xcite the problem in standard relativity theory , of course , is that of extending these _ local _ notions of simultaneity in a _ global _ manner .",
    "using inertial coordinate frames , this can be achieved for the special case of unaccelerated motion , but it is problematic for accelerating particles ( a limitation that in hindsight , should perhaps seem a bit odd ) .    in any event , the quantum relativistic theory developed here provides a _ global concept of simultaneous events _ for a single , arbitrarily - moving particle , in the form of the simultaneity submanifolds described above .",
    "this is perhaps most physically meaningful if one adopts a `` many worlds''-type ontological interpretation of the multiple particle paths / trajectories , according to which each trajectory worldline literally represents a different world , as has been discussed in previous work.@xcite the one particle is thus comprised of many `` copies , '' distributed across all space .",
    "locally , the structure of the orthogonal subspace described above ensures that each particle copy agrees with its nearest neighbors as to which events occur simultaneously .",
    "because of the global distribution of copies , however , this notion can be extended globally throughout all of space .",
    "in this fashion  and much like einstein s own orthogonal - ruler - and - clock construction of inertial frames  one builds a global manifold of simultaneous events , agreed upon by all particle copies , regardless of whether some or all of those copies are accelerating , and despite the fact that they never cross paths .",
    "note that the simultaneity submanifolds are _ not _ absolute , in the sense of being agreed upon by all _ observers_. a different quantum observer ( or particle ) would have its own copies , its own trajectory ensemble , and ( in general ) an entirely different set of simultaneity submanifolds .",
    "this is as it should be .",
    "note that for two quantum observers to agree completely on simultaneity , every trajectory in one ensemble must match the corresponding trajectory in the other ensemble ( i.e. , the two trajectory ensembles must be identical ) .",
    "likewise , a `` quantum inertial observer '' is characterized via an ensemble of parallel straight - line trajectories  i.e .",
    ", by u^= const^. [ inertialdef ] thus , for example , if @xmath40 satisfies , then the contours of @xmath41 ( expressed in the @xmath42 coordinate system ) define the simultaneity submanifolds for a quantum inertial particle , whose trajectory orbits are given by the intersections of the @xmath43 contours .",
    "as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - inertial ] , this special case is of course , entirely consistent with the usual global notion of simultaneity for unaccelerated particles  except that here , it is obtained in a more rigorous , essentially completely local fashion .",
    "the reason is that @xmath29 is a four - velocity vector field ",
    "defined on all of @xmath8 , rather than just along a single trajectory .",
    ", as functions of the inertial coordinates , @xmath44 , to which they are related via a lorentz transformation [ ] .",
    "the dashed lines are the contours of @xmath45 .",
    "these represent `` simultaneity submanifolds''i.e . , sets of spacetime events that occur simultaneously  for an inertial observer moving with the primed frame .",
    "the solid lines are the contours of @xmath46 , any one of which could represent the trajectory of the moving inertial observer or particle , according to standard sr theory .",
    "collectively , the solid lines constitute a _",
    "relativistic quantum trajectory ensemble _ , describing a single relativistic particle undergoing quantum inertial motion . ]    more generally  i.e .",
    ", for accelerated motion  the relativistic quantum trajectories and simultaneity submanifolds behave more along the lines indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig - gaussian ] . unlike comoving frames,@xcite the simultaneity submanifolds of the present theory",
    "are curved .",
    "this is appropriate , given that the trajectories are also curved ( albeit in the extrinsic rather than intrinsic sense ) .",
    "the curvature of the simultaneity submanifolds also enables them to avoid intersecting each other  thus also avoiding the problems of multiple reoccurences and incorrect time orderings that plague the comoving frame approach .",
    "finally , the simultaneity submanifolds are everywhere orthogonal to the trajectories , and thus each submanifold consists only of spacelike separated events .",
    "it should be noted that the ability to construct global simultaneity submanifolds is not automatic , but in fact , induces a slight constraint on the allowed form of @xmath29 . using frobenius theorem,@xcite and the fact that the @xmath29 field is ( presumed ) smooth",
    ", it can be shown that only fields for which @xmath47 is four - curl - free ( for some scalar field @xmath48 ) are permissible .",
    "( technically , this is slightly more restrictive than the actual condition , but it is a sufficient condition that suits our purposes better ) .",
    "this condition implies that the four - velocity field is the normalized gradient of some scalar field @xmath49 : u^= c -^ _  , [ lambdaeq ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( and it is presumed that @xmath52 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is a timelike parameter that we call an `` ensemble time . '' actually , it is a full - fledged scalar field , and can therefore be interpreted as a global time _",
    "coordinate_. imply that the @xmath53 _ contours are the simultaneity submanifolds_. the term `` ensemble time '' is therefore justified , as all members of the ensemble ( i.e. , all particle copies ) agree that events corresponding to the same value of @xmath49 occur simultaneously .",
    "the actual @xmath49 value itself , however , is not uniquely defined . in general ,",
    "any transformation of the form @xmath54 yields a new ensemble time coordinate with the same contours , and which otherwise also satisfies . for the moment",
    ", we treat all such choices equally .",
    "later , we will identify special candidates to serve as the `` ensemble proper time , '' @xmath55 ( secs .",
    "[ uniformizing ] and  [ conversion])i.e . , the ensemble analog of the usual single - path proper time , @xmath56 .    even for a path ensemble ,",
    "it is straightforward  and often convenient  to construct a true proper time coordinate , @xmath15 , as a scalar field on @xmath8 . for each path in the ensemble , labeled by @xmath4 , one",
    "simply chooses a reference point @xmath30 at which @xmath15 is taken to be zero , and then integrates along the path to find the value of @xmath15 at all other points .",
    "there is thus a freedom in the definition of the @xmath15 coordinate , associated with the particular choice of reference point @xmath30 for each path .",
    "this freedom corresponds to coordinate transformations of the form  =  ( , * c * ) = + ( * c * ) , [ taudef ] where the shift , @xmath57 , varies across paths .",
    "although the @xmath56 coordinate is useful in its own right , note that any choice of @xmath56 is in general incompatible with any @xmath49 coordinate of the form described above .",
    "in particular , for two different paths of a given ensemble , both starting at the same simultaneity submanifold ( @xmath49 contour ) and ending at another , the elapsed ensemble time @xmath58 is the same , but the elapsed proper times @xmath59 are ( generally ) different .",
    "thus , @xmath56 per se can not generally serve as a good ensemble time coordinate , @xmath49 .",
    "the situation above is not problematic , and in fact , reflects nothing more than a generalized version of the well - known ( but poorly named ) twin `` paradox . ''",
    "the conventional twin paradox has one twin leaving the other at spacetime point @xmath60 , only to rejoin him or her at a later point @xmath61 , after having undergone accelerated motion .",
    "the accelerated trajectory of the second twin is necessary , in order that their paths may recross ( the stay - at - home twin is presumed to undergo inertial motion ) .",
    "since the starting point for both twins is in fact the same event @xmath60 , there can be no question but that the departures occur simultaneously .",
    "likewise , the reunion at @xmath61 is the same event for both twins , and must therefore also occur simultaneously .",
    "nevertheless , we know that the elapsed proper times for the two twins are different , with the stay - at - home twin having aged ( in some renditions , very significantly ) more than his or her more adventurous sibling .",
    "a similar situation characterizes our ensemble of paths  except that we now have a global definition of simultaneity , so that we can specify that two such paths begin `` at the same moment '' even if the initial spacetime events are different .",
    "likewise , we can uniquely specify the simultaneous `` end '' of the two paths , as the points where these paths intersect a different @xmath49 contour .",
    "the global property of the simultaneity submanifolds is indeed required , as any two paths within a given path ensemble never cross .",
    "even though the two paths start and end simultaneously , the generalized twin paradox implies that there is no reason to expect the two elapsed @xmath59 values to be the same  and indeed they are not , in general . for the special case where all paths are moving inertially  i.e .",

    "of course , time reversibility implies that the force must also be independent of the _ past _ state of the particle , which leaves only the present . in this manner ,",
    "we are led to :    * _ postulate 2 : _ all force vectors , together with the quantities used in their construction , must `` live '' on the simultaneity submanifolds .",
    "the meaning of this statement will be made more precise as we go along . in any case , we take postulate 2 as a necessary condition for any viable physical theory  at least for particles with mass , in the context of non - relativistic or relativistic classical or quantum mechanics . as shown above , it certainly holds for non - relativistic classical particles .",

    "thus , for example , a relativistic force vector can _ never _ be simply the gradient of some scalar invariant potential : @xmath158 . on the other hand ,",
    "one simple way that can be achieved is by taking @xmath156 to be the product of an antisymmetric tensor and @xmath29 .",

    "as it happens , the @xmath160 tensor _ does _ depend on future particle states , because this quantity is obtained from all partial derivatives of @xmath159 .",

    "the reason is that the full @xmath160 tensor is not actually required to construct @xmath156only that portion of the tensor that is projected onto the local simultaneity submanifold is used .",
    "consequently , although @xmath159 values at points other than @xmath30 are required , these points occur simultaneously with @xmath30 , lying neither in its past nor its future , and so postulate 2 is indeed satisfied .",
    "similar arguments will prove relevant , also , for quantum force fields , although these arise in an altogether different manner .",

    " may seem , it is quite problematic.@xcite this is true even if one restricts consideration to the positive energy solutions only  thus avoiding problem ( 1 ) , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ intro ] . to begin with",
    ", the dalembertian form of the kg @xmath230 clearly violates postulate 2 , as discussed .",

    "third , and even more egregious : the sign of @xmath126 may change , during the course of the evolution  thus implying a trajectory that turns a corner in time , or a particle that dynamically changes the sign of its charge .",
    "finally , the interpretation of the spatial probability density in the two theories  i.e . , the kg @xmath126 vs. the tdse @xmath363is fundamentally different , with the kg @xmath343 alone insufficient to specify a relativistic quantum state ( the time derivative is also needed ) .",
    "it is perhaps remarkable that all of these difficulties of the kg approach appear to be remedied though what amounts to a fairly simple fix : _ restrict the derivatives used to construct the quantum potential so that these act only on the 3d spatial simultaneity submanifolds , rather than the full 4d spacetime_. because , in the relativistic context , the quantum trajectories themselves define the simultaneity submanifolds , this restriction also seems to imply that _ a trajectory - based formulation must be used in the relativistic context_or at least , is more fundamental than a wavefunction - based approach .",
    "though we have not yet succeeded in developing a linear relativistic quantum wave equation , it remains an open question whether or not this is in fact possible .",
    "in addition to the reason stated above , another important reason why it may not be possible has to do with the variation of @xmath364 across a simultaneity submanifold , and the fact that relativistic quantum trajectories evolve at different rates across the ensemble . adopting a kg quantum trajectory approach , it is exactly this effect that causes @xmath365 , as well as the other undesirable properties of the kg @xmath355 that have been discussed .",
    "alternatively , adopting the present approach , the resultant relativistic quantum trajectories are evidently well - behaved  but likely at the expense of the existence of an equivalent linear wave equation . in any case , in the non - relativistic limit  where both the wave and trajectory approaches are certainly viable  the variability across the ensemble of @xmath364 , and the associated trajectory evolution rates , disappears .",

    "it is worthwhile to consider exactly _ why _ it is that the gaussian form  and only that form ",
    "is preserved over time in the non - relativistic context .",
    "fortunately , the trajectory ensemble approach provides a very straightforward answer .",
    "because of postulate 1 , preservation of the probability density form requires that initially uniformly spaced trajectories [ i.e. , @xmath390 remain uniformly spaced over time . from a dynamical perspective , this in turn requires that the initial velocity and acceleration fields , @xmath391 and @xmath392 , be linear in @xmath393 .",

    "the @xmath392 condition is satisfied if and only if the initial force field is linear in @xmath393 . for a free particle ,",
    "only quantum forces are present , and so a linear force field requires that @xmath399 exhibit a quadratic dependence on @xmath393 .",
    "the only @xmath400 functional form that can give rise to such a @xmath401 is the gaussian .    from , an initially gaussian @xmath400 implies a gaussian @xmath78 , because @xmath402 at @xmath403 ( since @xmath404 is presumed , and @xmath405 because the application is 1d ) .",
    "of course , @xmath78 is preserved over time  but this property is not unique to the gaussian alone ; it is always true , due to postulate 1 .",
    "rather , the fact that both sides of maintain a gaussian form for all @xmath6 implies something special about @xmath18namely , that @xmath406 is independent of @xmath393 . the value of @xmath407 indicates the extent of gaussian dispersion or broadening present at time @xmath6 .",
    "thus , if the initial gaussian is taken to be a coherent state , @xmath408 for all @xmath6 , with the equality holding only at @xmath403 .",
    "let us now apply a similar analysis to the relativistic free particle problem . without substantive loss of generality , we presume an initially _ stationary _ coherent state gaussian wavepacket of the following form : again , the fact that @xmath78 _ per se _ remains gaussian over time is not special , as this property would be true for any relativistic quantum wavepacket , by virtue of postulate 2 . in what sense ,",
    "then , should the question of the preservation of the gaussian form be addressed ?    to this end , it is natural to consider the usual spatial probability density , @xmath409 . however , for fixed @xmath410 , this function can not be gaussian .",
    "the reason is that the linear ( with respect to @xmath411 ) velocity field , @xmath412 , that this would entail would require the exterior trajectories in the ensemble to travel superluminally .",
    "the one exception would be the case of parallel trajectories ; but in this case , the probability density would be uniform or exponential , rather than gaussian ( see secs .  [ inertial ] and  [ exponential ] ) .",

    "the relevant probability density quantity is thus @xmath109 .",
    "the _ a priori _ reason why this approach might have a chance of being successful is because the simultaneity submanifolds fan outwards away from the @xmath411 axis , so that the interior trajectories are evaluated at earlier @xmath6 relative to the the exterior trajectories ( see fig .  [ fig - gaussian ] ) .",
    "the latter are thus afforded more time to spread themselves out .",
    "the condition that the trajectories be distributed uniformly across a given simultaneity submanifold , labelled by @xmath62 , is that @xmath413 be independent of @xmath393in exact analogy with the non - relativistic case . in order",

    "such a strategy is likely to fail , however  because the other formulations rely explicitly or implicitly on the tdse for @xmath0 , whose relativistic generalization is presumably the kg equation .",
    "although the prospect of a viable single - particle relativistic linear wave equation is not entirely ruled out , it seems quite unlikely ( sec .",
    "[ kg ] , and discussion below ) ; in any case , no such equation has materialized after more than eighty years . without such an equation ,",
    "however , it is not clear how the other , @xmath0-based non - relativistic formulations are to be relativized , as the linear superposition postulate is not satisfied.@xcite    under such hypothetical circumstances , the present formulation  and any associated ontological interpretation  would become the _ only _ viable single - particle theory able to explain experimental observation , as opposed to one amongst several equivalent competing theories .",
    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ simultaneity ] , the present approach indeed suggests its own natural `` many worlds '' interpretation  wherein each trajectory in the ensemble constitutes a distinct world , or universe .",
    "this is very different from `` conventional '' many worlds theory,@xcite however . for one thing",
    ", the trajectory worlds _ do _ interact with each other ( which is , indeed , the source of all quantum behavior ) ; for another , the worlds do not branch over time ( new trajectories are not `` born , '' e.g. , as a result of measurement , but exist for all time ) . a further discussion would be out of place in this document , but can be found in our previous work,@xcite and in future work specifically addressing the quantum measurement ramifications of the trajectory - based approach .",
    "after the above , admittedly speculative discussion , it now behooves us to provide a summary of what has actually been achieved here thus far .",
    "the key ideas , in rough order of logical dependence , are listed below :    * general covariance * trajectory ensembles * simultaneity submanifolds * postulate 1 : probability conservation along trajectories * postulate 2 : dynamical forces do not depend on future system states * universality of the quantum potential * principle of least ( or extremal ) action    these are the most essential elements , leading to a nearly unambiguous theory of relativistic quantum mechanics , as presented in this work .",
    "of course , the einstein equivalence principle,@xcite or more broadly , the principle of general covariance , pervades everything that we do here  restricting possibilities , and otherwise guiding towards the relativistically proper forms for all quantities .",
    "the idea of ensembles of trajectories that foliate spacetime is borrowed from the non - relativistic theory , but is equally natural in the relativistic context , where it is arguably even more important .",
    "the reason is that it leads directly to the construction of simultaneity submanifolds for accelerating particles  a central idea of this work , crucial to all of the subsequent development presented here .",
    "a rigorous , global definition of simultaneity is problematic for classical relativistic theory , because a single trajectory can explore only a small portion of spacetime .",
    "it is not clear that any such viable notion existed previously  despite certain clever prior developments in this direction , involving intersecting light cones emanating from the worldline , and the like.@xcite in a trajectory _ ensemble _",
    "approach , however , the construction of simultaneity submanifolds is extremely natural and unambiguous . in this respect",
    ", the quantum mechanical generalization of relativistic theory actually makes things much easier .",
    "postulates 1 and 2 provide important insight into the kinematics and dynamics associated with the trajectory ensemble time evolution .",
    "one of the most surprising conclusions ( at least for the author ) to come out of this work is the idea that the kg equation does not satisfy postulate 2as reasonable as both the equation and the postulate might seem .",
    "the latter is , after all , satisfied by relativistic and non - relativistic classical mechanics , as well as by non - relativistic quantum mechanics ; it really should be expected to hold in the relativistic quantum context as well .",
    "a quantum application of the postulate 2 condition logically requires a global notion of simultaneity .",
    "such a structure already exists _ a priori _ for the non - relativistic case , but for relativistic applications , seems to require a trajectory ensemble or related approach . in any case , kg theory does not provide a simultaneity structure , leading to an evident causality paradox .    in previous work,@xcite",
    "it has been argued that the quantum potential should adhere to a _",
    "universal form_which is quite independent of the particular dynamical law ( e.g. , non - relativistic vs. relativistic ) .",
    "this form can be derived without reference to the tdse  although the resultant trajectory - based non - relativistic pde turns out to be equivalent to it , as has been mentioned several times . in the relativistic context ,",
    "for which there is no previously existing pde with which to compare , the _ a priori _ universality of the @xmath230 form obviously plays a central role in the development of the formulation .",
    "finally , of course , the notion of action extremization ",
    "so central to classical mechanics , relativity theory and the trajectory - based non - relativistic quantum theory  is also applied to the present relativistic quantum application , placing all of these theories within a single , unified framework .",
    "it is also to be hoped that we may have helped to set the stage for a possible integration with gr , and with quantum gravity .",
    "certainly , our use of general coordinates even in the sr context , lends itself to this purpose  as does the inherent use of density fields .",
    "we have , in any case , already uncovered some quite intriguing similarities  and differences  between the gravitational and quantum potentials , as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ conversion ] .",
    "not least of these is the fact that the value of @xmath230 itself  and not just its spatial gradient  plays a dynamical role in its own right , as seen explicitly in the nontrivial example of sec .  [ gaussian ] . also quite relevant ( in the non - relativistic context too )",
    "is the fact that very narrow wavepackets experience strongly dispersive quantum forces , causing very rapid broadening via trajectory fanout .",
    "thus , on small length scales  i.e .",
    ", on the order of the compton wavelength , but still larger than the planck length  quantum trajectory effects may prevent relativistic singularities from occurring , or may otherwise play an important dynamical role , e.g. in inflation .",
    "there are a number of additional areas for future development that might be considered",
    ". some are straightforward , such as the incorporation of external force fields ( e.g. , the electromagnetic field for charged particles ) , and a recasting of the various density and flux quantities into a stress - energy tensor form ( together with the development of energy and momentum conservation laws ) .",
    "less obvious will be determining how to generalize the present theory for multiple particles of fixed number ",
    ", the relativistic analog of the many - particle trajectory - based non - relativistic quantum theory already in place . here , the biggest and most important challenge will be to define simultaneity submanifolds for multiple particles .",
    "this is not so straightforward , and may well prove to be the `` achilles heel '' of the present approach ",
    "most likely related to the oft - quoted claim that relativistic theories involving interaction energies comparable to particle rest masses must encompass the creation / annihilation of particles.@xcite of course , one might also attempt to apply some of the current ideas in a varying - particle - number , qft context .",
    "given the difficulties of the kg equation , one wonders whether it is correct to use this as a basis for qft , as is currently accepted practice .",
    "how would things change if the present approach were adopted instead ?",
    "what impact might this have , e.g. , on theoretical predictions pertaining to the higgs boson or pi meson ?",
    "of course , the basic ideas developed here need not be limited to massive spin - zero bosons .",
    "it is only natural that one might consider revisiting the dirac field for spin 1/2 particles , as well as the quantized electromagnetic field describing photons , armed with the weapons developed in the present arsenal .",
    "it is not yet clear what such investigations might turn up  i.e .",
    ", whether they would lead to new theoretical predictions , as they seem to have done in the present case for spin - zero particles , or to predictions in substantive agreement with currently accepted theories . in the photon context , of course , the simultaneity submanifold concept _ per se _ would have to be discarded  presumably , to be replaced with an analogous family of null hypersurfaces .",
    "it is not yet clear whether this would even be possible .    even for the specific relativistic quantum pdes developed here",
    ", there is still much work that remains to be done , in terms of characterizing these fully .",
    "can an analytical solution for the relativistic gaussian ( or other nontrival ) wavepacket be derived ?",
    "are the solution ensembles always well - behaved ( subject to the conditions of sec .  [ basic ] ) , or is it possible that singularities can somehow develop ?",
    "are the pdes inherently nonlinear , or can they be recast into an equivalent linear wave equation ? under what conditions is numerical solution of the pdes unstable , and what sorts of algorithms can be used or should be developed ?",
    "one very basic property of particular interest has already been established .",
    "this is simply that the pde order in the spatial coordinates @xmath205 is twice that in the time coordinate ( @xmath62)even though these equations are perfectly invariant with respect to lorentz transformations .",
    "this is not surprising in one sense ",
    ", in light of the theoretical developments presented in this document ( notably pertaining to postulate 2 ) . in the context of the history of relativistic wave equations , on the other hand , it is highly unusual  if not borderline heretical .",
    "traditional treatments virtually always presume that the space and time orders must be identical , in order to treat these coordinates on an equal footing .",
    "the present theory , in contrast , suggests that _ there is indeed a fundamental difference between space and time_at least when these notions are interpreted in an appropriate manner , and linked to a single particle / observer .    in any case",
    ", it should be mentioned that the two - to - one ratio of space - to - time orders that characterizes the present relativistic quantum pdes as described above , also characterizes the non - relativistic quantum pdes  both the trajectory - based pde , and the tdse itself .",
    "this is , in large measure , why the present theory reduces so seamlessly to these others in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "one might also do well to recall that it is precisely the _ lack _ of such an asymmetry in the kg equation  i.e .",
    ", the fact that this equation is second - order in both space and time  that is known to lead to the difficulties described in sec .",
    "[ kg ] , especially that of defining a suitable probability density quantity .",
    "these problems were well understood in the early days of the quantum theory  but",
    "what is perhaps quite startling is that _ the same can be said of all of the theoretical tools used here to develop the present fix _ ( though of course , the trajectory - based formulation itself is new ) . in principle ,",
    "einstein or dirac , or one of their contemporaries , could have hit upon this very same approach .",
    "one ( at least the author ) has to wonder how things might have progressed differently , had this idea been born in say , 1932 , or even 1952,@xcite rather than in 2012 .",
    "this work was supported by grants from the robert a. welch foundation ( d-1523 ) and by a small grant for exploratory research from the national science foundation ( che-0741321 ) .",
    "the author would also like to acknowledge useful discussions with luis grave de peralta , george hinds , jeremy schiff , and hung - ming tsai ."
