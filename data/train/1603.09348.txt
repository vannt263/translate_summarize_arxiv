    "the first gravitational wave ( gw ) detection by advanced ligo @xcite put the field of gw astronomy in the spotlight . at nhz frequency ( inaccessible to ground based interferometers ) , pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) brings the promise of gw detection from inspiralling supermassive black hole ( smbh ) binaries .",
    "this is the primary goal of the european pulsar timing array ( epta ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves ( nanograv ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that join forces under the aegis of the international pulsar timing array ( ipta ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at those low frequencies ,",
    "the superposition of individual signal coming from smbh binaries is expected to produce a stochastic gravitational wave background ( gwb * ? ? ?",
    "its normalization is set by the cosmic merger rates of smbh binary systems and their typical masses , whereas its shape is affected by the interaction of the binaries with their stellar and gaseous environment , possibly suppressing the signal at the lowest frequencies .",
    "both the amplitude and the spectral shape of the signal are affected by significant uncertainties , some of which have been recently explored by several authors ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular the signal amplitude strongly depends on the smbh masses , which is set by the intrinsic relation between smbhs and either the host galaxy stellar bulge ( @xmath4 relation ) or the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 relation ) . in recent years",
    ", improvements in smbh dynamical mass measurements , together with the discovery of few `` overmassive '' black holes in brightest cluster galaxies @xcite resulted in a upward revision of the smbh - host galaxy relations , implying a median expected gwb signal with strain amplitude @xmath6 at @xmath7yr ( although values of @xmath8 are not excluded ) .",
    "therefore , recent pta non detections of the gwb at the @xmath6 level @xcite has been interpreted as being somewhat in tension with currently favoured smbh assembly scenarios , pointing to a possible important role of smbh binary eccentricity or environmental coupling @xcite .    however , recently @xcite ( s16 , hereafter ) , confirming the earlier finding of @xcite , showed that the set of local galaxies with dynamically - measured smbhs is biased .",
    "it has significantly higher velocity dispersions than local galaxies of similar stellar mass as determined from the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and this bias also affects the smbh - host galaxy relations . using targeted monte - carlo simulations , s16 showed that this bias could have been induced by the observational selection requirement that the black hole sphere of influence must be resolved to measure black hole masses with spatially resolved kinematics . by studying the impact of this bias on the local smbh scaling relations",
    ", they found this selection effect to artificially increase the normalization of the intrinsic @xmath5 relation by a factor @xmath9 , and the intrinsic @xmath4 relation by up to an order of magnitude at low stellar masses .",
    "the underlying unbiased relations would thus lie significantly below all previous estimates found in the literature , naturally implying a lower normalization of the expected gwb .",
    "the aim of this letter is to quantify the impact of the bias in local smbh scaling relations on the detectability of the gwb with ptas . in section 2",
    "we review our model for the computation of the gwb , and in section 3 we focus on the smbh - host galaxy scaling relations .",
    "we present our results in section 4 , discussing their implication for pta campaigns and we summarize our findings in section 5 . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a concordance @xmath10cdm universe with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . unless otherwise specified , we use geometric units where @xmath14 .",
    "the method we adopt to extract the gwb from observed properties of low redshift galaxies is fully described in @xcite ( s13 , hereafter ) . in the following we provide a short summary .",
    "we neglect issues related to possible binary coupling with the environment , eccentricity , and the possibility of resolving individual sources , which are beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we consider a cosmological population of smbh binaries , inspiralling in quasi - circular orbit , driven by gw back - reaction .",
    "each merging pair is characterized by the masses of the two black holes @xmath15 , defining the mass ratio @xmath16 for smbh binaries , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 for galaxies ] .",
    "the characteristic amplitude @xmath19 of the generated gwb is given by @xcite @xmath20 although the integrals formally run through the whole allowed range of each variable , @xcite showed that @xmath21 of the signal comes from major mergers ( @xmath22 ) involving massive binaries ( @xmath23 ) at low redshift ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the energy emitted per log - frequency interval is @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the chirp mass of the binary and @xmath27 is the gw rest frame frequency ( twice the orbital frequency ) .",
    "it then follows @xcite that @xmath28 where the normalization constant @xmath29 depends on the smbh binary merger rate density per unit redshift , mass and mass ratio given by the term @xmath30 in equation ( [ hcde ] ) .",
    "pta limits on a stochastic gwb are usually quoted in terms of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we summarize here the approach taken by s13 to determine @xmath31 .",
    "the procedure is twofold : ( i ) we determine _ from observations _ the _ galaxy _ merger rate @xmath32 ( in a merging galaxy pair , @xmath17 and @xmath33 are the stellar mass of the primary galaxy and the mass ratio respectively ) , and ( ii ) we populate merging galaxies with smbhs according to empirical smbh  host galaxy scaling relations . in this procedure , we assume a one - to - one correspondence between galaxy and smbh mergers ; significant delays between the two or possible stalling of smbh pairs will naturally _ reduce _ the integrated gwb .      the galaxy differential merger rate can be written as ( s13 ) @xmath34 @xmath35 denotes the galaxy mass function ( mf ) at redshift @xmath36 ; @xmath37 is the differential fraction of galaxies with mass @xmath17 at redshift @xmath36 paired to a secondary galaxy with mass ratio in the range @xmath38 ; @xmath39 is the merger time - scale for a galaxy pair and is a function of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath40 provides the conversion between proper time and redshift in the adopted cosmology .",
    "equation ( [ galmrate ] ) conveniently expresses the rate as a function of the directly observable quantities @xmath41 and @xmath42 , whereas @xmath43 can be inferred from numerical simulations ( see below ) .    ,",
    "predicted by all combinations of pair fractions and merger time - scales considered in this work ( light blue lines ) , compared to a compilation of theoretical and observational estimates .",
    "dark green squares are simulations from @xcite , the magenta triangle is from @xcite , the blue circles are a compilation of bcg simulations by @xcite and the brown open square is from @xcite .",
    "observational estimates are from @xcite ( purple circles ) , @xcite ( orange pentagon ) and @xcite ( yellow circle ) .",
    "red lines highlight models featuring an average mass growth in line with what observed for bcgs ( upper ) , and with typical massive galaxies ( lower ) .",
    "bottom panel , average number of mergers as a function of galaxy mass since @xmath44 .",
    "light blue lines are the models presented in this paper , with fiducial ones highlighted in red .",
    "dark green square are estimates from @xcite , the blue pentagon from @xcite , the violet triangle from @xcite and the yellow circle from @xcite . ]    improving on s13 , we explore four different mass functions ( labelled , mf1 - 4 ) .",
    "mf1 - 3 are constructed by matching individually the mfs at @xmath45 provided by to the local mass function estimated by @xcite .",
    "conversely mf4 simply assumes an extension of @xcite at all considered redshifts without evolution ( therefore providing an upper limit to the inferred gwb ) .",
    "this is also in line with the recent observational findings by @xcite at @xmath46 .",
    "we also explore four different differential pair fractions ( pfs ) @xmath47 , extracted from @xcite following the same procedure as in s13 ( see also detailed description in * ? ? ?",
    "we checked that those broadly match recent compilations of galaxy pfs from , e.g , @xcite . considering different",
    "mfs and pfs helps in folding into our computation possible systematic errors due to the specific samples and techniques adopted in each work . to account for statistical uncertainties ,",
    "each mf and pf comes with a fiducial value plus an upper and lower limits derived from the uncertainty range quoted in each paper .",
    "as in s13 , we explore a fast and slow merger scenario where @xmath43 is specified by ( i ) adopting equation ( 10 ) of @xcite @xmath48 and ( ii ) complementing equation ( [ tau ] ) with fits to the results of a set of full hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy mergers presented by @xcite , which gives @xmath49    we interpolate all the measured @xmath50 on a fine 3-d grid in @xmath51 , to numerically obtain @xmath52 differential galaxy merger rates .",
    "note that typical values of @xmath43 are up to few gyr , therefore , the merger rate at a given @xmath51 point in the grid is obtained by evaluating @xmath41 and @xmath42 at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the redshift delay corresponding to the merging time @xmath43 . by doing this , we implicitly assume that smbh binaries coalesce instantaneously at the merger time of their hosts .",
    "we extend our calculations to all galaxies with @xmath55 merging at @xmath56 , ensuring that we capture the bulk of the gwb ( see * ? ? ?",
    "using the same formalism of equation [ galmrate ] and following @xcite , the differential number of mergers experienced by each individual galaxy with mass @xmath17 is given by @xmath57 we can then compute the number of mergers experienced by each individual galaxy with a given mass at @xmath44 ( @xmath58 ) as @xmath59 , \\label{nmerger}\\ ] ] where the integral is consistently evaluated at the redshift - evolving galaxy mass @xmath60 through the dirac delta function .",
    "if we multiply the integrand of equation ( [ nmerger ] ) by a factor @xmath61 , we then obtain the mass growth of the galaxy , @xmath62 , since @xmath44 .",
    "results for all mfs and pfs considered in this work are compared to various estimates from the literature in figure [ fig1].the average number of galaxy mergers and mass growth are in line with observations and other theoretical estimates , validating the viability of our modelling .",
    "the last ingredient in the computation of the gwb from equation ( [ hcde ] ) is the connection between the host galaxy and the smbh mass .",
    "this issue is overcome by employing scaling relations between @xmath63 and either the galaxy bulge stellar mass @xmath64 or velocity dispersion @xmath65 , measured on a limited sample of nearby galaxies .",
    "recent estimates of the gwb are usually based on relations provided by @xcite and kh13 . in particular , we consider here the relations reported by kh13 : @xmath66 @xmath67 with intrinsic scatter @xmath68 dex , and @xmath69 dex respectively .    however , s16 have shown that both monte carlo simulations and the analysis of the residuals around the scaling relations suggest that @xmath65 is most fundamental galaxy property correlated to smbh mass , with a possible additional ( weak ) dependence on stellar mass . in particular the @xmath4 relation is mostly induced by the relation between @xmath70-@xmath65 and @xmath71 .",
    "s16 find the preferred intrinsic relation @xmath72 with intrinsic scatter @xmath73 dex . in the following",
    "we will consider the three scaling relations given above ; models adopting either equation ( [ srelkh13sigma ] ) or ( [ srelkh13bulge ] ) will be referred to as kh13 , whereas those adopting equation ( [ srels16 ] ) will be referred to as s16 .",
    "the relations link @xmath70 to the _ bulge _ properties , whereas our galaxy merger rates are function of the total stellar mass .",
    "we derive the bulge mass of each galaxy by multiplying the total stellar mass by a factor @xmath74 taken from @xcite for serexp galaxies with a probability @xmath75 of being ellipticals / lenticulars , which we fit as @xmath76 with an intrinsic scatter @xmath77 dex .",
    "velocity dispersion @xmath65 , corrected to the hyperleda aperture of @xmath78 kpc for consistency with s16 , is computed from the corresponding bulge mass and fitted as @xmath79 characterized by an intrinsic scatter @xmath80 in equations ( [ fbulge])-([sigmadisp ] ) , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are expressed in units of @xmath81 and km s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we assume no redshift evolution in any of the aforementioned relations up to @xmath82 .    finally ,",
    "each merger event , involves three bulges : the progenitors @xmath83 , @xmath84 and the remnant @xmath85 .",
    "we associate to these spheroids smbh masses @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , taken from the same scaling relation , and imposing the only constrain that @xmath89 . we therefore allow , during the merger , an amount of accretion @xmath90",
    ". this mass can be accreted with a different timing with respect to the smbh binary merger , and in different amount on the two smbhs .",
    "we follow the three prescriptions described in section 2.2 of @xcite .",
    "we stress that the exact details of the accretion model are not crucial as we are specifically interested in evaluating the impact of the bias in smbh scaling relations for pta searches .    the combination of the @xmath91 smbh population prescription with the 288 galaxy merger rates results in 2592 different smbh binary merger rates @xmath31 . by construction",
    "they are consistent with current observations of the evolution of the galaxy mass function , pair fractions at @xmath56 and @xmath55 , and with published empirical smbh - host relations .",
    "they also reproduce _ observational constraints _ on the number of galaxy mergers and mass growth ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "since we are primarily interested in assessing the impact of the smbh - galaxy relations selection bias on the expected gwb , we divide the 2592 models in two sub - sample featuring either the kh13 or the s16 relations .",
    "the expected characteristic amplitude ranges obtained in the two cases are compared in figure [ fig2 ] , together with current upper limits placed by the three pulsar timing arrays : epta @xcite , nanograv @xcite and ppta @xcite .",
    "including the s16 scaling relations in the model lowers the median value of the expected signal at @xmath0yr@xmath1 by a factor of three , from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "this is further elucidated in figure [ fig3 ] , where we show the resulting probability density distributions of @xmath29  cf .",
    "equation ( [ hcpar ] )  for the two cases .",
    "although recent limits show some tension with the kh13 models , they are fully consistent with the s16 models , which predict @xmath92 at 95% confidence . in the upper panel of figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we further separate models featuring mf1 - 3 to those featuring mf4 .",
    "as expected , the latter provides an upper limit to the signal , placing the median value at @xmath93 and @xmath94 for kh13 and s16 models respectively .",
    "conversely , the more realistic mf1 - 3 , place the median signals at @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "background  cf .",
    "equation ( [ hcpar ] )  , and the horizontal ticks are their extrapolation at @xmath0yr@xmath1 ]     assuming different scaling relations , as indicated in figure .",
    "top panel : all pair fractions and merger time - scale are considered .",
    "the solid distributions include all the adopted mfs , the long - dashed ones include mf 1 - 3 , and the short - dashed one assumes mf 4 .",
    "bottom panel : amplitude distributions assuming the two fiducial models highlighted in figure [ fig1 ] : fiducial1 ( long  dashed ) and fiducial2 ( short  dashed ) . ]    in figure [ fig1 ] , we highlighted in red two fiducial models ; one providing a good fit to the overall mass growth of medium - size galaxies ( fiducial1 , lower red curve ) , and one matching the mass growth of brightest cluster galaxies ( fiducial2 , upper curve ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath29 distributions from these models are reported in the lower panel of figure [ fig3 ] . obviously , model fiducial2 results in a higher signal , but only by just about 0.2 dex .",
    "median values remain in the range @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the kh13 and s16 models respectively .      to investigate the consequences for pta detection we follow @xcite ( hereinafter r15 ) .",
    "we consider an ideal ipta - type array with @xmath100 pulsars , timed with an rms residual @xmath101 ns at intervals @xmath102 weeks .",
    "we compute detection probabilities versus time by means of equation ( 15 ) in r15 , fixing a false alarm rate @xmath103 .",
    "we mimic the effect of fitting for the pulsar spin - down by excluding the two lowest frequency bins from the computation .",
    "although this is a crude approximation , it has little impact on our investigation , since we are interested in comparative results .",
    "we take two gwbs with @xmath95 and @xmath104 , representative of the kh13 and s16 models respectively .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig4 ] . in the latter case",
    ", there is a significant delay in detection probability build - up , reaching 95% about seven year later . since , for any given @xmath105 , s / n@xmath106 , a drop of a factor of three in @xmath19 can be compensated by an equivalent improvement of the rms residuals ( i.e. from @xmath101 ns to @xmath107 ns ) , by monitoring pulsars every couple of days , or by increasing the number of pulsars in the array .",
    "note that results in figure [ fig4 ] are shown _ from the start _ of the pta experiment ; for comparison , an @xmath95 signal would have a detection probability of only few% in current ipta data , which is marked by the vertical dotted line .",
    "however , one can not simply extrapolate ipta detection times based on this plot , since the s / n build - up pace depends on the number of pulsars , on their timing accuracy , on the addition of new pulsars and availability of novel instrumentation .    .",
    "the dashed green and solid purple lines are for signals with @xmath95 ( kh13 ) and @xmath104 ( s16 ) respectively , assuming an array of @xmath100 pulsars , @xmath101 ns and @xmath102 weeks .",
    "the black dotted line marks a detection probability of 95% . ]",
    "we investigated the impact of the selection bias in dynamical measurement of smbh masses on the expected gwb at nhz frequencies , accessible to ptas .",
    "we found that the revised smbh - host galaxy relations imply a drop of a factor of three in the signal amplitude , shifting its median to @xmath108 . note that since @xmath109 is proportional to the number of mergers , compensating this drop would require @xmath110 more smbh binary mergers , which is severely inconsistent with observational and theoretical estimates of galaxy merger rate ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this result resolves any potential tension between recent pta non - detections and theoretical predictions , without invoking any additional physics related to the dynamics of smbh binaries , such as stalling , high eccentricity or strong coupling with the surrounding stellar and gaseous environment . on the other hand",
    ", it also poses a significant challenge to ongoing pta efforts .",
    "if smbh - galaxy relations are in fact affected by the strong bias reported by s16 , the resulting gwb might be outside the reach of current ptas for several years to come .",
    "this picture is consistent with the stalling scenario of @xcite , in which a 95% detection probability is expected only in the next 8-to-12 years depending on the array .",
    "this is not surprising since their stalling scenario has a mean @xmath29 consistent with the implication of the selection bias in the smbh - host relations described here .",
    "our results call for a more extensive investigation along the lines of @xcite and @xcite , properly weighting - in new ultra - precise timing measurement with meerkat @xcite and fast @xcite starting next year , and eventually data collected with ska from 2021",
