    "in the hierarchical structure formation scenario @xcite mergers have played a strong role in forming and shaping galaxies .",
    "one of the common product of major mergers are the classical bulges @xcite which are the central building blocks in spiral galaxies .",
    "there have been a couple of other mechanisms suggested for the formation and growth of classical bulges e.g. , monolithic collapse of primordial gas clouds @xcite , the coalescence of giant clumps in gas - rich primordial galaxies @xcite , multiple minor mergers @xcite , accretion of small companions or satellites @xcite .",
    "the classical bulges formed via these processes seem to have little rotation as compared to the random motion . on the other hand ,",
    "various observational measurements have confirmed that classical bulges in spiral galaxies possess rotation @xcite about their minor axis and in most cases in the same sense as the disk rotates .",
    "it is also known that classical bulges rotate faster than elliptical galaxies and that often their rotation velocities are comparable to that of an isotropic oblate rotator model @xcite .",
    "so the origin of the systematic rotational motion observed in the classical bulges remains unclear .",
    "the photometric and kinematic properties of classical bulges as well as their origin are quite distinct from those of the other class of bulges , the boxy / peanut and disk - like bulges .",
    "it is well known that the surface brightness profiles in classical bulges follow a sersic law @xmath0 with sersic index @xmath1 . whereas the sersic indices in boxy and disk - like bulges are , in general , low with @xmath2 ; so that their surface brightness profiles follow roughly an exponential distribution , see @xcite for extensive reviews .",
    "the kinematics of bulges are well illustrated in the @xmath3 plot @xcite which clearly demonstrates the distinction in the kinematic properties of ellipticals , classical bulges and boxy bulges and brings out the fact that in terms of their rotational support , classical bulges fall in between ellipticals and boxy / disk - like bulges .",
    "since the boxy as well as disk - like bulges are thought to have formed from disk material , the source of their angular momentum is known .",
    "the classical bulges formed early through major mergers and violent relaxation can subsequently accrete material quiescently as a result of which a disk grows inside - out @xcite .",
    "the gas accretion may facilitate the disk to grow sufficiently for the disk self - gravity to dominate the internal dynamics .",
    "eventually , a bar and/or spiral arms form in the disk and initiate secular processes in the galaxy .",
    "indeed , bars are quite common in disk galaxies , about @xmath4 of the disk galaxies host a strong stellar bar in their central region @xcite",
    ". therefore one might expect the disk to go bar unstable also in galaxies with preexisting classical bulges .",
    "in fact , classical , boxy and disk - like bulges could co - exist @xcite in a single galaxy , although the observational identification of the several components could be difficult . in the milky way ,",
    "an upper limit on the mass of a classical bulge ( @xmath5 of the disk mass ) has been set by modelling the kinematics from the bulge radial velocity assay ( brava ) data @xcite .",
    "but there is evidence for a metallicity gradient above the galactic plane @xcite which is taken as an indication for the existence of a classical bulge in our galaxy .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the dynamical interaction between preexisting classical bulges and bars in barred galaxies .    in this paper , we investigate in considerable detail the interaction of a bar and a low mass classical bulge via a high resolution _",
    "n_-body simulation of a galaxy consisting of a live disk , bulge and dark matter halo , and follow the evolution of the dynamical structure and kinematics of the small classical bulge . we find that its dynamical evolution is strongly connected to the growth of the bar which forms spontaneously in the disk . during the secular evolution ,",
    "the structure and kinematics of the bulge are altered significantly , developing an interesting and complex rotation structure ; in particular , cylindrical rotation ( which is considered as a typical proxy of boxy bulge ) appears in the inner region of the classical bulge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : barbulgeinteraction ] summarizes the basics of bar - bulge interaction .",
    "section  [ sec : galaxymodels ] outlines the initial galaxy model and set up for the _ n_-body simulation .",
    "the bar evolution and boxy bulge formation are described in section  [ sec : barevolution ] .",
    "section  [ sec : lzexchange ] describes , in detail , the angular momentum exchange between the bar and the classical bulge .",
    "the evolution of the classical bulge , its structure and kinematics are presented in section  [ sec : bulgestructure ] .",
    "discussion and conclusions are contained in sections  [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : concl ] respectively . in the text , by bulge , we mean a classical bulge unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "as we have seen ( in section  [ sec : introduc ] ) , the possible co - existence of a bar and a classical bulge might be rather common in present day disk galaxies , and thus they are bound to interact gravitationally .",
    "in fact , a preexisting classical bulge in the disk has a strong influence on the formation and growth of the bar itself .",
    "for the swing amplification to work , one needs to keep alive the feedback loop through which a set of trailing waves traveling through the center are transformed into leading waves .",
    "this is possible as long as there is no inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) .",
    "a highly centrally concentrated bulge can shield the center by putting an ilr barrier and thus cutting the feedback loop which in turn could hinder the growth of the bar @xcite . however , various non - linear processes are probably active in real galaxies which would destroy the ilr barrier and eventually lead to the formation of a bar @xcite .",
    "once a bar is formed , it takes over the dynamics in the central region of the disk and starts interacting with the stellar bulge and dark matter halo through exchange of angular momentum .",
    "based on the work of @xcite , hereafter lbk72 , it has been emphasized by several authors @xcite that the resonant interaction plays a significant role in the angular momentum transfer between the bar and the dark matter halo .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that the same underlying mechanism could as well apply between the bar and the spheroid and in particular , @xcite have studied how the shape of a bulge would change in response to a growing bar .    although the dynamical interaction between a growing bar and a bulge and their subsequent evolution can be best studied via _",
    "n_-body simulations , an analytic understanding is required to complement this .",
    "following lbk72 , it can be shown that during the bar - bulge interaction the time rate of change of angular momentum of a classical bulge , whose distribution function ( @xmath6 ) is descibed by a king model , is always positive and can be written as    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the fourier amplitude and pattern speed of a non - responsive bar potential and @xmath10 is the velocity dispersion of the bulge stars .",
    "so at a given resonance , the angular momentum gained by the bulge depends on the strength of the bar and is inversely proportional to the square of bulge velocity dispersion , implying a hotter bulge will absorb less angular momentum provided other conditions remain unchanged .",
    "however , in real galaxies , the angular momentum transfer is more difficult to determine , because the time rate of change of bar s angular momentum involves the change in its pattern speed , moment of inertia , and in the angular momentum associated with any internal circulation @xcite within the bar . in section  [ sec : lzexchange ]",
    ", we show the angular momentum transfer between the bar and the bulge in our simulation using orbital spectral analysis .",
    "an equilibrium model for a disk galaxy is constructed using the self - consistent bulge - disk - halo model of @xcite .",
    "their prescription provides nearly exact solutions of the collisionless boltzmann and poisson equations which are suitable for studying disk stability related problems .",
    "all the components in our model are live ( i.e. , the gravitational potential of each component can respond to an external or internal perturbation ) and , hence , provide a realistic representation for the structure and evolution of the galaxy .",

    "there is also a considerable group of particles with @xmath90 ; a look to the orbits allows to identify them as mainly stochastic trajectories . in the lower panels , we show the angular momentum gain by the particles at each @xmath91 during the growth and evolution of the bar .",
    "there is a considerable gain of angular momentum by three main groups in our diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances ] , second bottom panel ) .",
    "the main gain of angular momentum comes from those particles at resonance with @xmath92 , corresponding to particles orbiting around the lagrangian points .",
    "since these particles are at negative frequency it means that they are counter - rotating with the bar .",
    "another gaining group corresponds to the particles with @xmath93 , the stochastic group . by gaining angular momentum their ( counter ) rotation decreases . amongst the low order resonances , the important gaining group is around the ilr ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "we can conclude that at this stage of evolution , which is very rapid , the main transfer of angular momentum occurs through resonant and stochastic orbits .    -1pt",
    "-1pt        during the period of evolution between @xmath95  gyr , the bar goes through the buckling event , therefore there is still some trapping of particles around the 2:1 resonance .",
    "although there not much gain or loss of angular momentum , some angular momenta are gained through @xmath96 resonance during this period .",
    "notice that in the upper row of panels , the number of bulge particles trapped at the bar s ilr ( 2:1 ) is increasing . in the forth panel , at @xmath97  gyr",

    "gyr the classical bulge is still gaining angular momentum through resonances at ilr and @xmath92 corresponding to the lagrange points .",
    "note that some of the angular momentum gain is also coming from the olr .",
    "although the number of particles trapped at the ilr is gradually increasing over time , their angular momentum gain does not follow accordingly . by comparing the last two panels ( upper and lower )",
    ", it is evident that the particles trapped at the ilr are now hardly gaining angular momentum .",
    "it is plausible that the inner bar - like structure in the classical bulge ( see section  [ sec : bulge - bar ] ) is giving away angular momentum to the outer parts of bulge and perhaps to disk and halo .",
    "the gain of angular momentum by the bulge can thus be explained by resonances during the slow secular evolution of the bar , and by resonances together with stochastic orbits in the dynamical stage . during the dynamical phase , @xmath103  gyr ,",
    "the net gain of angular momentum ( computed by adding up the averaged angular momentum of each orbit ) is @xmath104 times larger than that gained in the relatively quiet secular phase ( @xmath105  gyr ) . while approximately @xmath106 of the net angular momentum gain comes from the resonances , stochastic orbits contribute to @xmath107 of the net angular momentum gained during the dynamical phase .",
    "previous studies of angular momentum transfer to the live dark matter halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) have found important contribution from corotation , outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) and higher order resonances .",
    "by contrast , in the case of a small classical bulge as studied here , the olr and corotation have not played any significant role in the gain of angular momentum as shown above .",
    "this is most probably due to the fact that the size of the bulge in our simulation is much smaller than the typical size of the dark matter halo ; the bulge half - mass radius ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 at @xmath97 and @xmath110 gyr respectively ) is shorter than the bar size ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 at those times ) in our simulation .",
    "the bar size is measured from the phase angle of the bar @xcite .",
    "the phase angle of the bar ( i.e. , the @xmath67 fourier component of the disk surface density ) remains approximately constant upto a certain radius and starts varying beyond that .",
    "we measure the length of the bar as the radius at which the phase angle of the bar starts deviating from the contant value .",
    "we also note that the corotation resonance ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 at @xmath115 and @xmath110 gyr respectively ) of the bar is clearly outside the radius confining most of the bulge particles .",

    "[ fig : resonances ] , more and more particles in the classical bulge are trapped at the bar s ilr as time progesses . during the slow secular evolution",

    "this angular momentum transfer and the subsequent change of the orbital structure of the classical bulge are indeed responsible for the transformation of the classical bulge as described below .",

    "fig : bdenmaps ] . during the initial phases of secular evolution , the angular momentum gained by the bulge particles",
    "is primarily converted into streaming motion and the classical bulge starts rotating around the z - axis , with gradients in the streaming velocity both along the radial and vertical directions .",
    "note that in the barred potential , the classical bulge is no longer axisymmetric and its inner regions becomes moderately boxy ( see sections  [ sec : cbsurfb ] and [ sec : bulge - bar ] ) . this could be a signature of a thick bar formed inside the classical bulge ( see section  [ sec : bulge - bar ] ) .",
    "indeed as time progresses , mild signatures of cylindrical rotation emerge in the inner regions of the bulge and gradually become prominent ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bdenmaps ] ) .    to have a clearer picture of the velocity structure",
    ", we show parallel minor - axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vcb_minor ] ) and major - axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vcb_major ] ) velocity profiles of the classical bulge at two different epochs @xmath128 ( upper panels ) and @xmath102  gyr ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the minor - axis velocity profiles are drawn at two different radii ( @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) on either side of the bulge center . at @xmath128  gyr ,",
    "the minor axis rotation velocity decreases along the vertical direction ( @xmath140 ) indicating clearly a non - cylindrical rotation throughout the bulge ( see the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vcb_minor ] ) .",
    "note , the velocity profiles in the outer parts are asymmetric which is probably influenced by the on - going buckling instability of the bar .",
    "the major - axis profiles are taken at four different slits ( the slit positions are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcb_major ] ) parallel to the major axis of the classical bulge . the major - axis velocity profiles in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vcb_major ] , also indicate non - cylindrical rotation throughout the classical bulge .    at later times , the inner regions of the classical bulge have developed cylindrical rotation . however , the gradient of this cylindrical rotation in the classical bulge is shallower than that in the boxy bulge .",
    "the minor - axis velocity profiles in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vcb_minor ] , show clear indication for that in the inner regions .",
    "the same is evident from the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : vcb_major ] .",
    "the major axis velocity profiles at @xmath102 gyr clearly demonstrate that the inner regions ( @xmath141 ) of the classical bulge rotate cylindrically while the outer regions beyond about twice the half - mass radius ( @xmath142 ) still maintain differential rotation both along the radial and vertical directions ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "_ so in the later stages of the secular evolution , the initially non - rotating classical bulge has developed a mixed rotational state with the inner region rotating cylindrically while the outer region rotates differentially in z. _      in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the complex non - linear dynamical interplay of the bar and the bulge , we investigate the three dimensional structure of the classical bulge using spherical harmonics analysis .",
    "in particular , we are looking for non - axisymmetric modes in the classical bulge which could have been influential for producing some of the complex structure and kinematics as discussed in sections  [ sec : cbsurfb ] and [ sec : cbrotation ] .",
    "the outcome of the bar - bulge interaction is not only the transfer of angular momentum between the two and changes in kinematics thereby , but a structural transformation of the classical bulge , a prediction of which is probably beyond the scope of the analytic / semi - analytic theories @xcite briefly outlined in section  [ sec : barbulgeinteraction ] . from our analysis , it becomes clear that the interaction of a bar and a small classical bulge is more vigorous than that between the bar and the massive dark halo as discussed in section  [ sec : barbulgeinteraction ] .",
    "the primary reason being the smaller mass and size of the bulge compared to the dark matter halo .    to analyze the structural components developed in the small classical bulge after the evolution , we expand the full three dimensional bulge density distribution ( @xmath143 ) in terms of spherical harmonics :    @xmath144    where @xmath145 are the usual spherical coordinates , and the @xmath146 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "@xmath147 denotes the radial density function .",
    "we bin the bulge particles into spherical shells and compute @xmath148 as function of the bin radius ( @xmath149 ) , as follows :    @xmath150    where @xmath151 , @xmath152 is the mass of each bulge particle , @xmath153 are the associated legendre polynomials .",
    "the function @xmath148 is directly related to the mass of each bin and thereby to @xmath147 via the bin radius ( @xmath149 ) . then using the above formula ( eq .",
    "[ eq : blm ] ) , we can derive the radial variation of the amplitude of a particular @xmath154 mode in the bulge as @xmath155 .",
    "the corresponding phase angle @xmath156 can be used to derive the pattern speed of the @xmath157 mode .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgebarlm2 ] , we show the time evolution of the amplitude of @xmath158 mode .",
    "the classical bulge - bar ( hereafter , denoted as clbb ) is weaker than the disk bar ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : baramp ] for the bar amplitude and pattern speed ) but rotates nearly in phase with it . by analyzing the radial variation of the phase angles ,",
    "we conclude that the physical size of the clbb is much smaller compared to the disk bar .",
    "initially , the clbb and disk bar are not in phase , the clbb seems to be lagging behind the disk bar by about @xmath159 in angle .",
    "but soon , they start rotating in - phase with each other . after about @xmath160 gyr ,",
    "the pattern speed of the clbb is also nearly the same as that of the disk bar ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgebarlm2 ] ) . a convenient way of viewing the dynamics of the clbb , is to think of it initially as a driven oscillation phenomenon where the disk bar is acting as a driver and the bar - like structure in the classical bulge is its forced response .",
    "later bulge particles are trapped by the 2:1 resonance ; i.e. , both components populate the orbits in their jointly rotating potential .",
    "it has been shown in previous simulations e.g. , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that a bar - like structure also forms in the inner regions of the dark matter halo as a result of its interaction with the bar in the disk .",
    "these studies have shown that such a bar in the halo is rather weak and nearly corotates with the bar in the disk .",
    "it turns out that some of the characteristics of the clbb are quite similar to that of the halo - bar .",
    "however , with the classical bulge being much less massive than the halo , the dynamical impact of the bar - like structure is much more pronounced in the classical bulge as we have already demonstrated above . beside the transfer of energy and angular momentum between the disk - bar and the classical bulge , the stars in the classical bulge",
    "are also being heated during the evolution and hence the inner bulge region becomes moderately thicker and rounder ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bdenmaps ] ) .",
    "we have checked that the slow variation in the ellipticity of the classical bulge is consistent with the variation in the kinetic energy tensor in accordance with the tensor virial theorem .",
    "a more detailed picture of the dynamics of the bulge hosting a bar and its observational properties will be presented in a future paper .      from the misalignment of the photometric major axis of the disk and the bulge and the isophotal twists , it is inferred that many of the bulges in spiral galaxies are indeed triaxial @xcite . here",
    ", we show the evolution of the triaxiality and velocity anisotropy in the low mass classical bulge in our simulation .",
    "the global parameter for the bulge triaxiality @xmath161 can be computed using the following relation @xcite :    @xmath162    where @xmath122 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 are the semi - axes defining the shape of the classical bulge ( see section  [ sec : v - sig - epsa ] for the measurement of the axis ratios ) .",

    "@xmath169 defines a triaxial configuration with peak values reaching @xmath170 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgetrix ] , we show the evolution of the shape of the classical bulge .",
    "initially the bulge is oblate ( @xmath171 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgetrix ] ) ; thereafter it evolves as a result of the angular momentum gain and change in the orbital structure . during the period of @xmath172  gyr ( roughly the dynamical phase ) a considerable fraction of angular momentum",
    "is gained at resonances @xmath92 corresponding to the lagrange point orbits and @xmath173 ( ilr ) ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : resonances ] ) .",
    "this angular momentum gain cause the bulge particles to move outwards and thereby producing a disky structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bdenmaps ] ) in the outer parts of the bulge . in this period ,",
    "essentially only @xmath174 changes while @xmath175 remains nearly constant .    beyond @xmath176 gyr , the clbb forms in the bulge causing substantial changes in the bulge structure . as mentioned in section  [ sec : bulge - bar ] , the clbb heats @xcite the bulge stars mainly in the central region and makes it thicker . we think that this heating due to clbb is primarily responsible for subsequent changes in the @xmath175 . during the period from @xmath177   gyr , @xmath174 changes more than @xmath175 . at @xmath135  gyr ,",
    "the small classical bulge is triaxial with @xmath178 .",
    "this suggests that more generally , fast rotating and triaxial bulges could have developed through the interaction of a strong bar and a small classical bulge in galaxies with low @xmath179 ratio .",
    "a more comprehensive analysis focusing on the role of the most important parameters such as the bulge mass and size will be presented in a future paper .    as shown in section  [ sec : galaxymodels ] , the initial velocity distribution in the classical bulge in our simulation is isotropic represented by a king model . as a result of the angular momentum influx and the readjustment of the orbits , the velocity structure changes during the evolution .",
    "we measure the deviation from isotropy in the velocity distribution by the anisotropy parameters defined as @xmath180 and @xmath181 , where @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 are the velocity dispersions in the radial , azimuthal and vertical direction .",
    "then @xmath185 denotes radial anisotropy and @xmath186 means tangential anisotropy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgeaniso ] , we show the profiles of the radial anisotropy at four different epochs calculated from all the particles in the classical bulge .",
    "we see that the classical bulge already becomes radially anisotropic at @xmath128   gyr . to understand the source of radial anisotropy",
    ", we have studied orbits in the classical bulge as clarified in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances ] .",
    "[ fig : orbitaniso ] shows radial variation of @xmath187 and @xmath188 computed from bulge particles that are trapped at ilr ( @xmath173 ) and from a group of resonant and non - resonant particles in the frequency range @xmath189 separately .",
    "the particles that are at ilr resonance ( 2:1 ) follow x1-type orbits and they produce the radial anisotropy in the inner region of the classical bulge which host the clbb . whereas in the outer region",
    ", definite contributions to the radial anisotropy comes from the bulge particles in the frequency range @xmath189 .",
    "the particles that are at resonance with the bar e.g. , at @xmath190 follow regular orbits while the non - resonant particles are in stochastic orbits .      to quantify the degree of ordered motion in bulges and ellipticals and illuminate the difference between the two types of stellar systems , the @xmath191 diagram relating the ratio of rotational to random motions and the observed ellipticity ( @xmath192 ) was introduced @xcite .",
    "it was shown that bulges are , in general , fast rotators compared to bright elliptical galaxies . here , we focus on the relation between the shape and the kinematics of the simulated low mass classical bulge that has been subject to the secular evolution driven by a strong bar .",
    "we show explicitly the evolutionary track of this particular classical bulge in the @xmath191 diagram below ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vsigeps ] ) .    in observations ,",
    "it is rather difficult to have an accurate measurement of the bulge rotation velocity due to possible disk contamination . on the other hand , in simulations ,",
    "it is rather straightforward to compute the velocity profile for the classical bulge alone because it is possible to filter out the disk and halo components of the model galaxy .",
    "we determine , @xmath193 as the maximum of the azimuthally averaged rotational velocity of the bulge particles measured in the equatorial plane of the bulge ; @xmath194 is the mean velocity dispersion in the central region ( calculated at @xmath195 ) of the bulge .    for the bulge ellipticity , we use @xmath175 for edge - on view . measuring",
    "the ellipticity for a bulge is a bit tricky because there can be strong radial variation in the ellipticity profile @xmath196 .",
    "triaxiality could add another degree of complexity to such a measurement .",
    "below we describe how the bulge ellipticities are measured .    in order to determine the intrinsic ellipticity ,",
    "we first compute the moment - of - inertia tensor of the three dimensional mass distribution of the classical bulge and diagonalize it to obtain the principal moments and three orthogonal eigenvectors .",
    "the principal moments of inertia determine the intrinsic axis ratios of the inertia ellipsoid and the eigenvectors determine the orientation of the ellipsoid with respect to the co - ordinate space . using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors ,",
    "we determine the two axis ratios namely @xmath174 and @xmath175 , where @xmath197 are the three semi - axes of the inertia ellipsoid .",
    "we have done this at the bulge half - mass radius containing @xmath198% of the total bulge particles and at the radius containing about @xmath199% of the total bulge particles .",
    "the ellipticity measurements for the classical bulge are nearly the same in both cases . in the following ,",
    "we use the ellipticity at radii enclosing @xmath200 of the total bulge particles and use the definition of the ellipticity of the bulge as @xmath201 when viewed edge - on .",
    "we have also performed isophote analysis using the ellipse - fitting routine from iraf on a set of suitably rotated and inclined edge - on images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bdenmaps ] ) of the classical bulge at different epochs during the evolution .",
    "we find a good agreement between the two different types of measurements of the bulge ellipticity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vsigeps ] , we show the @xmath202 and @xmath192 values for the small classical bulge during the secular evolution . each point in this diagram corresponds to a particular epoch during its evolution and when connected together they form its evolutionary track .",
    "this shows that the small classical bulge rotates significantly faster in the latter stages of evolution compared to the oblate isotropic rotator model , which can be approximated by @xcite :    @xmath203    the interpretation of fig .",
    "[ fig : vsigeps ] is complicated by the fact that the classical bulge is not an isolated stellar system , but interacts dynamically with the bar within a disk galaxy .",
    "the entire period of evolution of the classical bulge can be broadly divided into two parts : one before the formation of the clbb ( @xmath176 gyr ) and the second after its formation .",
    "before the formation of the clbb , the bulge stars in the outer region gain a significant fraction of angular momentum emitted by the bar and move mainly outwards in radius . as a result of this ,",
    "the values of @xmath202 increase till @xmath176 gyr while the axis ratio @xmath175 remains unchanged . in the second half of the evolution",
    ", the bulge stars are heated due to the clbb by a factor of @xmath204 in velocity dispersion and this makes the inner region rounder .",
    "so @xmath175 ratio increases , making the ellipticity decrease considerably .",
    "the near saturation in the @xmath202 towards the end of the simulation is connected with the fact that the rate of angular momentum gain by the bulge nearly saturates at these epochs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : splz ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances ] ) . a more detailed analysis on how the spinning up of the classical bulge depends on the various parameters of the bulge ( bulge - to - disk mass ratio , size of the bulge , its central velocity dispersion ) and disk ( toomre q , bar strength , bar size ) will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the primary goal of this paper has been to describe a generic mechanism , the transfer of angular momentum from a bar to an embedded classical bulge .",
    "we have shown that this mechanism is important for understanding the rotational motion of low mass classical bulges in the central regions of barred galaxies .",
    "the growth rate and the strength of the bar are important factors for the mechanism to work efficiently .",
    "one very interesting outcome of this process is the cylindrical rotation in the small classical bulge in the model studied here .",
    "some possible observational implications and other issues are addressed below .      during the secular evolution",
    ", a flat bar transforms into a boxy bulge .",
    "while the bar grows , buckles and evolves , a fraction of the angular momentum emitted by the bar is absorbed mainly in the outer parts of the embedded classical bulge in the galaxy . as a result",
    ", streaming motions are induced in the classical bulge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vcbulge ] ) , and the orbital structure changes , causing velocity anisotropies . after about half a gyr , the clbb forms in the inner regions of the bulge .",
    "the clbb introduces a pattern rotation in the classical bulge which transforms into a rotating triaxial object . a comparision of fig .",
    "[ fig : baramp ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : bulgebarlm2 ] shows that beyond @xmath205 gyr the clbb essentially corotates with the boxy bulge formed out of the disk bar . towards the end of the evolution ,",
    "the model galaxy has a composite bulge : a superposition of the boxy bulge and a rotating triaxial classical bulge . at late times , the inner regions of the classical bulge become rounder as it is evident from the surface density maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bdenmaps ] ) for the classical bulge particles alone .",
    "we note that the stars in the classical bulge are heated by a factor of @xmath204 in velocity dispersion within @xmath206 gyrs .",
    "the clbb maybe responsible for heating the bulge stars in a similar fashion as the bar heats the disk stars @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that cylindrical rotation is a characteristic feature of the kinematics of a boxy bulge formed out of disk material , via the vertical buckling instability of the bar .",
    "thus the presence of cylindrical rotation in the central regions of a galaxy may lead one to infer the presence of a boxy bulge that originated from the disk , without any need for a classical bulge in this galaxy .",
    "the work presented in this paper adds a new aspect to this simple picture .",
    "the cylindrical rotation could also include the stars of the classical bulge whose rotational properties have been modified by the interaction with the bar .",
    "one would measure the net cylindrical rotation of the stars in the combined boxy bulge and classical bulge . in absence of strong photometric evidence , other information such as from stellar populations and metallicity gradients",
    "would be needed to determine the presence of a small classical bulge .",
    "although the pure kinematic modelling of the brava data @xcite suggests only an upper limit on the mass of a classical bulge in the milky way , the measurements of the metallicity gradient above the galactic plane @xcite may indicate the presence of a classical bulge .",
    "the upper limit on the total mass of the bulge ( boxy bulge + classical bulge ) in our model , including the remaining disk component in the boxy bulge region , is @xmath207 . of this",
    ", @xmath208 is in the classical bulge , and @xmath209 in the boxy bulge and the central disk .",
    "since the classical bulge extends further above the galactic plane than the boxy bulge , the metallicity composition of the composite system would change with height .",
    "we plan to investigate this further and use our model to look for signatures of the classical bulge from the metallicity distribution in order to compare with observations of the milky way .",
    "previous studies mainly based on _",
    "n_-body simulations have focused on the bar - halo interaction @xcite and shown that a significant amount of angular momentum emitted by the bar is absorbed in the dark matter halo . the angular momentum gained by the halo changes the internal structure of the dark matter halo .",
    "some authors have utilized this mechanism of angular momentum exchange to resolve the cusp - core issue @xcite in galaxies while others have focused on the halo - bar @xcite .",
    "however , direct observational evidence for the halo - bar , and hence direct observational verification of the ongoing secular evolution and angular momentum transfer can not be obtained unless dark matter is detected . unlike the dark matter",
    ", it is possible to observe galactic bulge stars in detail , both the kinematics and stellar population parameters .",
    "it is thus possible to verify observationally the bar - bulge interaction and the resulting dynamical properties of the clbb .",
    "observational evidence for the clbb could be a direct confirmation of the angular momentum transfer and secular evolution in the galaxy .",
    "the secular processes driven by the bar not only restructure the disk , but also the other components in the galaxy .",
    "since the classical bulge is less massive here compared with the surrounding dark matter halo , the angular momentum gained by the classical bulge has a more significant effect on its evolution .",
    "the present work has shown in considerable detail that the unavoidable gravitational interaction between these two components can have profound implications for the structure of a low mass classical bulge , as highlighted below .",
    "we have established that the main mechanism of angular momentum transport operating between the bar and the classical bulge is through resonances .",
    "the bulge particles gain angular momentum emitted by the bar through the bar s ilr ( @xmath94 ) , and other resonances with @xmath210 and also through non - resonant orbits with @xmath211 during the dynamical phase when bar growth is rapid .",
    "approximately @xmath212 of the net angular momentum is gained by the classical bulge during the dynamical phase where stochastic orbits contribute @xmath213 .",
    "the angular momentum gained by the initially non - rotating classical bulge sets the bulge particles in rotational motion .",
    "the radial gradient in the rotational motion in the classical bulge is lower than in the boxy bulge . as time progresses the rotational velocity increases and",
    "nearly saturates at about 1 gyr . at around this time",
    ", the inner regions of the classical bulge develop cylindrical rotation while the outer parts are still in differential rotation .    \\3 . as a result of the angular momentum transfer ,",
    "some of the bulge orbits are trapped by the rotating bar potential , a clbb forms which essentially cororates with the bar , and the classical bulge transforms into a triaxial , anisotropic object where trapped orbits contributes to the radial anisotropy .    \\4 . towards the end of the secular evolution ,",
