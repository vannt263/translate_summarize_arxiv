    "an _ ice - type _ or _ vertex _ model was first proposed by pauling @xcite as a model for ( type i ) water ice .",
    "it was known that ice forms a hydrogen - bonded crystal , i.e. , the oxygen atoms are located on a four - valent lattice and the bonding is mediated by one hydrogen atom per bond .",
    "pauling proposed that there be some non - periodicity in the arrangement of the hydrogen bonds in that the hydrogen atoms could be located nearer to one or the other end of the bond .",
    "this positioning should satisfy the _ ice rule _ , stating that always two of the bonds are in the `` close '' position and two are in the `` remote '' position with respect to the considered oxygen atom . denoting the position of the hydrogen atom by a decoration of the bond with an _ arrow _ pointing to the closer oxygen , this leads to the arrow configurations depicted in figure [ vertex_conf_fig ]",
    "when for simplicity placing the oxygens on a square lattice instead of the physically realized diamond lattice .",
    "generalizing the resulting _ six - vertex model _ for square ice , one assigns energies @xmath1 , @xmath2 , to the vertex configurations depicted in figure [ vertex_conf_fig ] , resulting in boltzmann factors @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the inverse temperature or coupling . assuming an overall arrow reversal symmetry ( corresponding to the absence of an external electric field ) , one abbreviates @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ". then , the original ice model corresponds to the choice @xmath8 , @xmath2 , whereas another especially symmetric version assumes @xmath9 which is known as the @xmath0 model of anti - ferroelectrics @xcite , since due to the choice of weights the vertex configurations 5 and 6 will dominate for low temperatures , resulting in a ground - state of staggered , anti - ferroelectric order as depicted in figure [ sixvertex_groundstates_fig ] .",
    "the six - vertex model as well as the more general eight - vertex models , obtained by including sink and source vertices with all four arrows pointing in and out , respectively , have been exactly solved in zero field using transfer matrix techniques , see reference @xcite .",
    "they exhibit rich phase diagrams featuring first - order and continuous phase transitions as well as multi - critical points .",
    "in particular , the six - vertex @xmath0 model undergoes an infinite - order transition of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type to an anti - ferroelectrically ordered phase and the scaling behaviour of the basic thermodynamic quantities can be extracted from the closed - form solution . since there is no solution of the model in a ( staggered ) field",
    ", however , information about properties related to the polarization is incomplete .",
    "the same is true for the correlation function , which can only be evaluated at the so - called free - fermion point of the model @xcite ( the correlation length , however , is exactly known for all temperatures , see below ) .",
    "also , since the solution was obtained in the thermodynamic limit , information about finite - size scaling ( fss ) is not exact , but must be deduced from scaling arguments .",
    "apart from its prominent position as a non - trivial solvable model of statistical mechanics , the @xmath0 model has enjoyed sustained interest due to its equivalence to the bcsos surface model @xcite , and hence several _ dynamical _ generalizations of the six - vertex model have been considered @xcite . a six - vertex model with so - called domain - wall boundary conditions",
    "has recently attracted considerable interest and found numerous applications in counting problems , the quantum inverse scattering method etc .",

    "the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless @xcite scenario of an infinite - order phase transition induced by the unbinding of vortex pairs in the two - dimensional _ xy _ model has been found exceptionally hard to confirm numerically @xcite .",
    "this is partially due to the nature of the infinite - order phase transition itself , which is not easy to distinguish from a finite - order transition numerically , and the presence of a critical phase , which render many of the standard fss techniques less useful .",
    "the main trouble , however , is caused by the presence of logarithmic corrections , expected to be present on general grounds for a theory with central charge @xmath10 @xcite and explicitly found from the bkt theory of the model @xcite . while a numerical confirmation of the leading scaling behaviour of the bkt transition has been achieved in the past decade or so , the resolution of the logarithmic scaling corrections is still at the forefront of problems amenable to numerical investigation today @xcite .     model .",

    "thus , apart from being an interesting subject in its own right , a detailed analysis of the thermal and fss properties of the six - vertex @xmath0 model in the critical phase and at its bkt point serves as a guideline for simulations of the _ xy _ model case .",
    "guidance is been given here through the fact that the exact solution of the @xmath0 model yields the leading singularities _ including the correction terms _ explicitly , and , most notably for numerical purposes , the exact critical coupling of the model .",
    "uncertainties occurring in analyses of the _ xy _ model such as systematic errors in the determination of the transition point or the effect of neglected higher - order correction terms can be studied rather explicitly for the @xmath0 model . finally , when it is found here that one has to consider large system sizes and proceed carefully when including correction terms into the fits , this situation should also be put into relation with the case of an @xmath0 model placed on an annealed ensemble of _ random lattices _ considered recently @xcite .",
    "guided by the present investigation , this case has to be analyzed even more carefully due to an additional fractality of the lattices , which reduces the effective linear extent of the amenable lattice sizes , thus increasing finite - size effects even further .",
    "the other paradigm example of an exactly solved non - trivial model of statistical mechanics , the two - dimensional ising model , has served as a benchmark system and playground for new ideas in the theory of critical phenomena as well as for new algorithms in computer simulations in an overwhelming number of studies , and almost all of its aspects have been investigated ( but not necessarily understood ) . in contrast , for the case of vertex models only rather recently efficient cluster - update monte carlo algorithms have been developed @xcite , mainly with the mapping of vertex models on quantum chains in mind , and some simulations of special aspects of the six - vertex model , such as dynamical critical exponents of the considered algorithms @xcite , properties of the equivalent surface models @xcite , matching of renormalization - group flows with the _ xy _ model @xcite , or the case of domain - wall boundary conditions @xcite have been analyzed . a systematic thermal and fss study of the @xmath0 model in the critical high - temperature phase , at the critical point and its low - temperature vicinity including the analysis of the logarithmic correction terms , however , is to our best knowledge lacking so far .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the extent of exact knowledge about the phase diagram and the occurring transitions of the six - vertex model and the @xmath0 model in particular and give an overview over scaling at a bkt point in general . after a short description of the simulational setup used",
    ", section 3 contains a report of the analysis of the simulation data , comprising the fss analyses of the critical - point thermodynamic properties ( where the corresponding fss relations are explicitly derived from the closed - form solution ) , an investigation of the behaviour in the critical phase as well as a thermal scaling analysis in the low - temperature phase of the model .",
    "finally , section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "the square - lattice , zero - field six - vertex model has been solved exactly in the thermodynamic limit by means of the bethe ansatz by lieb @xcite and sutherland @xcite . the analytic structure of the free energy is most conveniently parametrized in terms of the reduced coupling @xmath13 such that the free energy takes a different analytic form depending on whether @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "this leads to a phase diagram of the model consisting of four distinct phases as shown in figure [ sixvertex_phase_diagram ] .",
    "the phases i and ii are both characterized by @xmath16 , thus corresponding to the same analytic form of the free energy ; they represent ferroelectrically ordered phases , the ground - states being related to each other through a global rotation by @xmath17 . in these phases , the system exhibits the peculiarity of sticking to the respective ground - states also for non - zero temperatures .",
    "the intermediate case @xmath15 , corresponding to phase iii , includes the infinite temperature point @xmath18 and thus belongs to a disordered phase , which turns out to be massless , i.e. , it exhibits algebraic correlations throughout .",
    "this latter effect can be traced back to the fact that the six - vertex model corresponds to a critical surface in the phase diagram of the eight - vertex model . finally , for @xmath14 one has @xmath19 , resulting in the anti - ferroelectric order of phase iv described above for the @xmath0 model .",
    "the parameter space of the @xmath0 model is restricted to the dashed line connecting phases iii and iv indicated in figure [ sixvertex_phase_diagram ] .",
    "the dotted line of figure [ sixvertex_phase_diagram ] indicates the curve @xmath20 , where the six - vertex model is equivalent to a system of free fermions and an exact solution is even possible in the presence of a staggered field @xcite .",
    "the nature of the transitions between the phases i  iv can be extracted from the exact solution @xcite . crossing the phase boundaries i @xmath21 iii and ii @xmath21 iii one finds discontinuities corresponding to first - order transitions .",
    "the transition iii @xmath21 iv , on the other hand , is peculiar in that all the temperature derivatives of the free energy exist and vanish exponentially as the transition is approached .",
    "these are the properties of a bkt phase transition to be detailed below in section [ sec : kt ] .    while the ferroelectrically ordered phases i and ii exhibit a _",
    "plain _ polarization , which can be used as an order parameter for the corresponding transition , the anti - ferroelectric order of phase iv is accompanied by a _",
    "staggered _ polarization with respect to a sub - lattice decomposition of the square lattice .",
    "this is equivalent to a mutually inverse plain polarization on two tilted , square sub - lattices as indicated in figure [ sixvertex_groundstates_fig ] .",
    "an order parameter for the corresponding transition can be defined by introducing overlap variables @xmath22 for each vertex @xmath23 such that @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the anti - ferroelectric ground - state configuration depicted in figure [ sixvertex_groundstates_fig ] and the product `` @xmath26 '' denotes the overlap given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 numbers the four edges around each vertex and @xmath29 should be @xmath30 or @xmath31 depending on whether the corresponding arrow of @xmath32 points out of the vertex or into it .",

    "although the general @xmath0 model has not been solved in a staggered electric field , as a single result the spontaneous staggered polarization is known exactly for all inverse temperatures @xmath47 @xcite , @xmath48 where again the first two forms are rapidly convergent for large @xmath46 , away from criticality , and the third form converges fast close to the critical point @xmath49 . as a proper order parameter , the spontaneous polarization @xmath50 vanishes identically in the critical high - temperature phase @xmath51 .",
    "as stated , the @xmath0 model undergoes an finite - order phase transition of the bkt type at @xmath36 . for later reference ,",
    "let us shortly bring to mind the basic features of the bkt scenario for the two - dimensional _ xy _ model @xcite , which forms the paradigmatic case of an infinite - order phase transition , albeit the exact solution of the @xmath0 model was published a couple of years earlier . as a consequence of the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem @xcite , the two - dimensional _ xy _ model can not develop an ordered phase with a non - vanishing value of a locally defined order parameter for non - zero temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , it undergoes a finite - temperature phase transition resulting from the unbinding of _ vortex pairs _ superimposed on an effective spin - wave behaviour of the low - temperature phase . above the critical temperature , spin - spin correlations decay exponentially",
    ", @xmath52 while below @xmath53 long - range correlations are encountered , @xmath54 such that the correlation length @xmath55 for all @xmath56 and the massless low - temperature phase corresponds to a critical line terminating in the critical point @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath57 varies continuously along this critical line , with @xmath58 .",
    "approaching the critical point @xmath53 from above , the correlation length diverges _ exponentially _ instead of _ algebraically _ as for a usual continuous phase transition , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the behaviour of further observables at the transition point can be conveniently expressed in terms of this singularity of the correlation length .",
    "in particular , the magnetic susceptibility diverges as @xmath62 the specific heat , on the other hand , is only very weakly singular , behaving as ( omitting a regular background contribution ) @xmath63 finite - size scaling analyses of the bkt transition are hampered by the occurring essential singularities and the presence of a critical phase . as a consequence of the latter , magnetic observables such as the susceptibility do not exhibit maxima in the vicinity of the critical point , which otherwise could be used for an estimation of the transition temperature from finite systems . for the same reason ,",
    "also the binder parameter requires a more careful treatment than at a standard second - order phase transition @xcite . nevertheless , the general arguments for finite - size shifting and rounding remain valid , such that suitably defined pseudo - critical points @xmath64 for systems with linear extent @xmath65 scale to the critical point @xmath53 as @xcite @xmath66/t_c\\sim(\\ln l)^{-1/\\rho } ,    \\label{kt_fss_shifts}\\ ] ] cf .",
    "equation ( [ exponential_xi_sing ] ) , since sufficiently close to the critical point the growth of the correlation length becomes limited by the linear extent @xmath65 of the system .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath67 can be replaced by @xmath65 ( neglecting corrections to scaling for the time being ) to yield the fss law @xmath68 which for @xmath69 predicts a rather strong divergence . on finite lattices , the specific heat is found to exhibit a smooth peak , which is however considerably shifted away from the critical point into the high - temperature phase and does not scale as the lattice size is increased @xcite .",
    "thus , with the main strengths of fss being not exploitable for the bkt phase transition , the focus of numerical analyses of the _ xy _ and related models has been on _ thermal _ scaling , see , e.g. , references @xcite . in addition , renormalization group analyses predict _ logarithmic corrections _ to the leading scaling behaviour @xcite , as expected for a theory of central charge @xmath10 , which have been found exceptionally hard to reproduce numerically due to the presence of higher order corrections of comparable magnitude ( for the accessible lattice sizes ) @xcite .",
    "from the exact solution of the square - lattice @xmath0 model , equations ( [ eq : f_low])([eq : polarization ] ) , one extracts the asymptotic behaviour in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath36 .",
    "approaching the critical point from the low - temperature side , @xmath70 , the singular part of the free energy density ( [ eq : f_low ] ) and the correlation length ( [ eq : corrlength ] ) behave as @xmath71 since @xmath46 goes as @xmath72 for @xmath73 , this exactly corresponds to the essential singularity described above for the bkt transition of the two - dimensional _ xy _ model with @xmath61 .",
    "the specific heat has the weakly singular contribution @xmath74 as expected .",
    "concerning properties related to the order parameter , the situation for the @xmath0 model is somewhat different from that of the _ xy _ model .",
    "the order parameter ( [ eq : polarization ] ) is non - vanishing for finite temperatures in the ordered phase model with its discrete symmetry . ] .",
    "thus , the corresponding staggered anti - ferroelectric polarizability @xmath75 shows a clear peak in the vicinity of the critical point for finite lattices .",

    "is expected throughout this phase .",
    "in fact , for the free - fermion case @xmath20 or @xmath88 , which is exactly solvable in a staggered field @xcite , a logarithmic divergence of the polarizability is found , implying @xmath89 .",
    "more recently , the behaviour of @xmath90 in the critical phase of the @xmath0 model has been conjectured from scattering methods to follow the form @xcite @xmath91 this is in agreement with the exact results for the critical @xmath0 model at @xmath35 and the free - fermion case at @xmath20 .",
    "additionally , the pure ice model at @xmath92 is known to have a `` dipolar '' correlation function with @xmath93 as predicted by ( [ eq : delta_conjecture ] ) @xcite .",
    "note that , since the dual relation to the _ xy _ model is only valid at criticality and the _ xy _ model magnetization is not equivalent to the polarizability of the @xmath0 model , this result is not simply related to the exponent @xmath90 of the _ xy _ model in its critical low - temperature phase , which actually _ decreases _ as one moves into the critical phase , see , e.g. , references @xcite .",
    "the common occurrence of a bkt type phase transition for the _ xy _ and @xmath0 models is no coincidence .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that the critical points of both models are asymptotically dual to each other @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by noting that the villain representation of the _ xy _ model @xcite is dually equivalent to a model of the solid - on - solid ( sos ) type known as the discrete gaussian model @xcite , which in turn , as typical for sos models , can be mapped onto the coulomb gas @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 model , on the other hand , also has a height - model representation known as the bcsos ( body - centered sos ) model @xcite , which is itself asymptotically equivalent to the coulomb gas .",
    "alternatively , the stated equivalence can be seen from the loop representation of the o(@xmath94 ) vector model @xcite , which for the critical o(@xmath95 ) model yields a close - packed loop ensemble equivalent to that of the loop representation of the critical @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "the apparent discrepancy regarding the magnetic exponents @xmath96 and @xmath97 between the _ xy _ and @xmath0 models , on the other hand , is not an indicator of different universality classes of the models , but reflects the fact that the @xmath0 model staggered polarizability is not equivalent to the magnetic susceptibility of the _ xy _ model .",
    "for an analysis of the six - vertex @xmath0 model via monte carlo simulations , a suitable simulation update scheme has to be devised .",
    "since the focus here lies on the investigation of the vicinity of the bkt transition and the critical phase of the model , all local updates will suffer from the severe critical slowing down with dynamical critical exponent @xmath98 expected at or close to criticality .",
    "fortunately , a fully - fledged framework of cluster algorithms has been constructed for the simulation of the six- and eight - vertex models , mainly motivated by their equivalence with the trotter - suzuki decomposition of quantum spin chains . here",
