    "zinc oxide ( zno ) is a wide bandgap semiconductor that has attracted a great deal of attention with demonstrated applications in ultraviolet ( uv ) light detection , air - quality monitoring , missile warning systems , gas detection , and utilization as light - emitting diodes .",

    "_ demonstrate growth of un - doped zno films having a polycrystalline wurtzite structure , where grain size is seen to increase with annealing temperature.@xcite the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum for zno typically includes a broad ultraviolet ( uv ) band emission attributed to excitonic binding energies and green and yellow band emission , due to various defect states.@xcite in several instances , blue - band emission has also been reported.@xcite    wu _ et al .",
    "_ argue that deep - level green and yellow emission corresponds to a recombination of a delocalized electron close to the conduction band with a deeply trapped hole in the single ionized oxygen vacancy ( v@xmath0 ) and the single negatively charged interstitial oxygen ( o@xmath1 ) ion centers , respectively.@xcite there has been much debate on the cause of defects leading to specific pl emission , and several possibilities have been suggested such as growth environment , annealing temperature , and film thickness .",

    "show decreasing deep level band intensities with increasing temperature when films are oxidized in oxygen ambient via a two - step process.@xcite these seemingly conflicting reports suggest that the oxidizing agent and final annealing temperature is critical in determining pl behavior .",
    "the origin of blue emission is controversial .",
    "_ describe strong blue emission possibly caused by stress resulting from the volume expansion of the zno transformed from zn during high treatment temperature.@xcite whereas zhang _",
    "et al . _ have shown that the intensity of the blue pl peak is strongly dependent on the oxygen pressure.@xcite they conclude that one source of blue level emission is from the electron transition from the shallow donor of oxygen vacancies to the valence band , while another is electron transmission from the shallow donor level of zinc interstitials to the valence band .",
    "however , wu _ et al . _",
    "argue that blue emission is related to zn interstitials found within the depletion region .",
    "they argue that a large depletion region relative to the bulk results in blue emission , since bulk - related defects associated with deep - level emission would dominate except when bulk volume is comparable to that of the depletion region.@xcite    we investigate the effects of film thickness on pl emission for zno grown via thermal oxidation of zn - metal films . specifically , if green and blue emission result from defect - related energy levels in the bulk and depletion region , respectively , as suggested by wu _ et al._,@xcite and",
    "we decrease the bulk to depletion region ratio via a decrease in thickness , then we should observe a corresponding decrease in the green to blue emission ratio .",
    "in this study , zinc films were grown on _ c_-plane sapphire substrates using direct current sputter deposition without reactive gas .",
    "the sputter cathode used was a 1 \" diameter 99.99% purity zinc target mounted on a water - cooled stage .",
    "a turbomolecular pump maintained a background pressure of ~@xmath3 mbars before deposition . during deposition ,",
    "an argon pressure of ~@xmath4 mbars was maintained via a metal leak valve and pump throttling .",
    "deposition times ranged from 10 - 60 minutes at sputter power between 15 - 30 w. all resulting zn films were initially oxidized by thermal annealing in an open air muffle furnace at a temperature of 300c for over 24 hours . some films",
    "where then re - annealed at temperatures of 600c , 900c , and 1200c for two hours .",

    "there is very little change in the underlying characteristics between zinc - metallic films and zno films annealed at 300c ; however , surface roughness is observed to increase and protrusions grow in size by approximately 50 nm .",
    "this is consistent with previous studies , where gupta _ et al .",
    "_ show that the preferred orientation of zno thermally oxidized on glass can depend on the zn film texture and oxidizing agent.@xcite as shown in fig .",

    "interestingly , for 200 nm thick films , grain size decreased with increasing temperature up to a certain point . figures [ fig : afm](b - c ) show a decrease in protrusion diameter from approximately 150 nm to approximately 100 nm at annealing temperatures of 300c and 600c , respectively , with no further significant change in size as temperature was further increased .",
    "grain size , as determined by the full width at half maximum in the xrd spectra ( not shown ) , was also found to decrease with increasing temperature up to 600c , with relatively small increases at higher temperatures , which is consistent with afm measurements .",
    "this observation appears inconsistent with some reports in the literature for thermally oxidized zno films.@xcite this discrepancy may be the result of our two - step thermal annealing process , where metallic zinc films are all initially oxidized at low temperature , the differences in studied temperature regimes , and the variations in film thickness .",

    "a more narrow band in the uv is observed in most cases , which is associated with excitonic emission ; however , the 200 nm film demonstrates an asymmetric and broad band in the blue - uv region at higher temperatures .",
    "for all thicknesses , the strongest uv excitonic emission is observed at low temperature , with decreasing uv emission observed with increasing annealing temperature .",

    "_ both demonstrate that an increase in particle size should result in a redshift in energies , which appears inconsistent with our results.@xcite however , these studies discuss systems where quantum size effects become relevant , and the particle sizes in this study are sufficiently large that the shift in bandgap can not be explained via a similar mechanism .",
    "speculate that this red shift is the result of an increase in interstitial zinc atoms.@xcite    ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl - spectra ] , 600 nm films demonstrate increasing yellow - green band intensity with increasing annealing temperature when compared to uv emission .",
    "this is consistent with previous research showing higher temperature results in a rapid increase in v@xmath0 and o@xmath1 ion centers.@xcite the broad and asymmetrical yellow - green peak observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pl - spectra](a ) for the 600 nm film can be gaussian divided into two bands in the yellow and green region .",
    "figure [ fig : green](a - c ) shows the pl spectra ( solid lines ) for films annealed at various temperatures with a model consisting of the linear combination of two gaussian peaks centered on yellow and green energies ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we observe a small red shift ( 0.5 ev ) in green band emission without a corresponding shift in yellow emission , which wang _ et al . _",
    "attribute to differences in the annealing temperature contribution to the respective defects responsible.@xcite also , the green to yellow ratio increases dramatically at annealing temperatures above 600c .",
    "in contrast , 200 nm thick films demonstrate little green and yellow band emission at any temperature [ see fig . [",
    "fig : pl - spectra](b ) ] .",
    "deep level emission is attributed to bulk defects , therefore it is possible that decreased bulk volume results in the formation of relatively fewer deep - level states . if green and yellow emission results from the recombination of a delocalized electron close to the conduction band with a deeply trapped hole in the v@xmath0 and o@xmath1 centers in the bulk , respectively , then a decrease in film thickness would decrease the bulk with respect to the depletion region , resulting in weaker bulk - related , deep - level emission.@xcite reaction kinetics could also contribute , with thinner films having shorter diffusion paths for reactive oxygen species during oxidation.@xcite thin films would therefore demonstrate fewer v@xmath0 and o@xmath1 ions at any annealing temperature , as observed .    ]",

    "the uv excitonic emission is observed as expected considering the bandgap energies of the films .",
    "specifically , the uv peak for the 200 nm film [ fig .",
    "[ fig : gauss - fits](c ) ] is redshifted in a manner consistent with the observed shift in bandgap ( see fig . [",
    "fig : tauc - plot ] ) .",

    "the pl spectra for the 200 nm thick film [ fig .",
    "[ fig : gauss - fits](c ) ] exhibited the most dramatic blue band emission and very low green band emission .",
    "similarly , wu _ et al .",
    "_ found that the intensities of the green and yellow cathodoluminescence peaks were strongly affected by the width of the free - carrier depletion region near the surface.@xcite they argue that single ionized oxygen vacancies exist only in the bulk , so the magnitude of the depletion region in relation to the bulk directly affects the intensity of the green emission in the cathodoluminescence spectrum .",
    "it has been suggested that blue emission results from zinc interstitials found in the depletion region , so an approximately 400 nm blue emission should only be observed in a sample with a wide depletion region relative to the bulk .",
    "otherwise , deep - level green emission will dominate.@xcite therefore , it is not surprising that we would observe the emergence of blue emission with decreasing film thickness , since limiting thickness lowers the ratio of bulk to depletion region .",
    "temperature and grain size may also contribute , since no blue emission is observed for 200 nm films annealed at 300c [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : pl - spectra](b ) ] .",
    "as discussed , we observe larger grain size via xrd and afm for 200 nm films annealing at 300c , resulting in a larger bulk to depletion region ratio , which could contribute to weaker blue emission . as with the green emission ,",
    "reaction kinetics associated with temperature may also contribute , were thinner films would have shorter diffusion paths for reactive oxygen species during oxidation , and lower temperatures would slow the zn / o@xmath6 reaction .",
    "the result could be fewer zinc interstitials , which would manifest as weaker blue emission and a red shift in both blue and uv emission , as is observed .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the pl emission from zno grown on sapphire substrates via the thermal oxidation of zn - metal films at various temperatures and thicknesses .",
    "pl spectra indicate four emission bands , excitonic ultraviolet ( uv ) , blue , and deep - level green and yellow emission .",
    "films annealed at lower temperature exhibited the strongest uv emission intensity and lowest blue and deep - level emission .",
    "an increasing ratio of deep - level green to excitonic uv emission was observed with increasing annealing temperature , which may be attributed to the generation of oxygen vacancies and interstitial oxygen ions in the bulk .",
    "the ratio of green to blue band emission decreased with decreasing film thickness , suggesting that the origin of the blue emission is related to zinc interstitials found within the deletion region near the surface .",
