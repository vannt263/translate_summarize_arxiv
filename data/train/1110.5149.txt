    "for a simple , but realistic , model of a strong ti we use a tight - binding model on the diamond lattice with spin - orbit coupling ( soc):@xcite @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the annihilation operator on site @xmath9 where we have suppressed the spin index , @xmath10 the nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath11 the chemical potential , @xmath12 the next - nearest - neighbor soc , @xmath13 the cubic cell size , @xmath14 the pauli spin matrices , and @xmath15 the two bond vectors connecting next - nearest - neighbor sites @xmath9 and @xmath16 . in order to access a surface",
    "we create a slab of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) along the ( 111 ) direction with abbcc ... aabbc stacking terminations on each side , respectively .",
    "we find that for @xmath17 lateral unit cells there is minimal cross - talk between the two surfaces . by further distorting the hopping amplitude to @xmath18 along one of the nearest - neighbor directions not parallel to ( 111 ) , this system becomes a strong ti , with a single surface dirac cone located at one of the @xmath19 points in the surface brillouin zone.@xcite we use an energy scale such that the slope of the surface dirac cone @xmath20 , which is achieved by setting @xmath21 throughout this work . in order to study the effect of a local potential impurity we create a rectangular - shaped surface supercell with @xmath22 sites along each direction",
    "this gives a supercell surface area of @xmath23 , where we use @xmath24 as the unit of length .",
    "we create an impurity on site @xmath9 on the surface by adding the term @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the impurity strength , to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) .",
    "we note that by adding @xmath27 we break particle - hole symmetry and thus our model , even with @xmath28 , corresponds to a quite general situation .",
    "we solve @xmath29 in the supercell by using exact diagonalization .",
    "we find that a @xmath30 @xmath31-point grid gives sufficient resolution , while at the same time using a gaussian broadening of @xmath32 when calculating the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "we first focus on the change in the ldos as a function of impurity strength @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ fig : usweep](a ) shows the ldos on the nearest - neighboring surface sites to the impurity for a sequence of different values of @xmath3 at fixed impurity concentration . for very weak impurities ( @xmath33 ) the impurity resonance resides inside the bulk valence - band . with increasing @xmath3 ,",
    "the resonance peak moves to lower energies and enters the bulk gap region , where it becomes clearly visible amid the dirac surface spectrum .",
    "eventually , for large enough @xmath3 , the resonance peak moves _ past _ @xmath34 , where the dirac point of the unperturbed system is located . with increasing @xmath3 the peak does not significantly change its height or width , although a second subpeak develops on the right - hand side for large @xmath3 values",
    "this subpeak even comes to slightly dominate the original peak when @xmath35 .",
    "we believe the origin of the double peak is the overlap of impurity states at large impurity concentration , when the impurity states start forming a band and the resonance peak broadens due to overlap .",
    "indeed , the peak - peak splitting goes down when increasing @xmath22 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : uvac](a ) ] .",
    "the whole peak structure is non - dispersive in energy over the whole supercell and in fig .",
    "[ fig : usweep](c ) we see that the position of the impurity resonance scales as @xmath36 . in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) continuum model for the surface state ,",
    "the same @xmath3 dependence was established but the resonance peak was found to get narrower and taller with increasing impurity strength and it finally disappears at unitary scattering.@xcite we further find that the peak height decays with distance approximately as @xmath37 for all values of @xmath3 , a faster decay than found previously.@xcite this difference could be related either to the inherent 3d nature of the state or to the fact that we are only looking at the short distance behavior .",
    "the finite resonance peak at low energies for strong scattering raises the question of stability of the dirac point .",
    "figure  [ fig : usweep](b ) shows the ldos at surface sites far from the impurity , and we see that with increasing scattering strength , the apex of the dirac spectrum , i.e. ,  the dirac point , moves to positive energies and that the resonance peak never moves past this point .",
    "however , for large @xmath3 we also see the development of a _ second _ dirac point on the left - hand side of the impurity peak , such that at unitary scattering the negative - energy dirac cone terminates in a point to the left of the resonance peak , whereas the positive - energy dirac cone terminates in a point to the right of the peak .",
    "thus , for very large @xmath3 , the resonance peak is situated between the apices of the valence- and conduction - band dirac cones . in fig .",
    "[ fig : usweep](c ) the development of the two dirac points with respect to @xmath38 is plotted in red ( light gray ) . the shaded gray area indicates approximately the region of large @xmath3 where the second , left - hand side , dirac point is present . beyond this region",
    "there is no real second dirac point , only a non - zero dip in the dos .",
    "below we will in detail analyze separately the case of weak scattering , when the resonance peak and the dirac point are well separated , and the case of strong scattering , when the peak structure is in close proximity to the dirac point .",
    "for a weak impurity we find that the resonance peak moves to slightly lower energies when the impurity concentration decreases . at the same time the right - hand side subpeak clearly diminishes ,",
    "such that the center of mass of the peak is still approximately constant .",
    "more distinct is the development of the position of the dirac point when changing impurity strength and concentration .",
    "not only does he dirac point shift to positive energies , but also the high - energy feature of the dos closes linearly to the , now shifted , dirac point . with the overall chemical potential @xmath39 set to zero , one could imagine an overall shift in the dirac point directly related to @xmath40 , as there are @xmath41 surface sites and @xmath3 acts as a local doping source .",
    "now , this argument is too simplistic since it does not , e.g. ,  take into account any of the sub - surface sites , or how the effective doping @xmath3 spreads over the surface . despite this , we still see a shift of the dirac point to positive energies , which is approximately linear in @xmath3 . moreover , for @xmath42 the dirac point position is roughly proportional to @xmath43 , whereas for @xmath44 the concentration dependence has weakened to @xmath45 .",
    "we therefore attribute the shift of the dirac point to positive energies to an effective and uniform surface doping by the impurities , which , in the limit of an isolated impurity , disappears .",
    "now , let us concentrate on the strong scattering regime , where the resonance peak and the dirac point can no longer be thought of as separate entities . in fig .",
    "[ fig : uvac ] we plot the ldos for a vacancy ( @xmath46 ) at different impurity concentrations .",
    "we see directly in fig .",
    "[ fig : uvac](a ) that for decreasing impurity concentration , the impurity resonance becomes significantly sharper , the impurity peak - peak splitting diminishes , and the prominent dip in between the two peaks , at around @xmath47 , disappears .",
    "the inset further shows how the total number of states within the peak does not significantly change with @xmath22 and also seems to converge to a value of @xmath48 states per unit area for low concentrations .",
    "thus , for the dilute impurity case @xmath49 , we expect a single resonance peak to be present in the low - energy spectrum , contrary to 2d surface - state continuum model results.@xcite we attribute this difference to the 3d dimensionality of the problem .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : uvac](b ) we plot the ldos as far away from the impurity as the supercell construction allows , in order to focus on the development of the dirac points with impurity concentration .",
    "these dirac points are located on both sides of the resonance peak , symmetrically with respect to the center of the peak structure . these are not only the points where the dos reaches down to zero , but they are also the points where the high - energy negative and positive dirac cone spectra close , i.e. ,  where the dirac apices associated with the slopes at higher energies are located .",
    "this verifies the nature of these two points as dirac points . with decreasing impurity concentrations",
    "the two dirac points move closer together since the resonance peak then becomes narrower .",
    "thus , for very low impurity concentrations the apices of the negative and positive high - energy spectra will almost converge to a single point at the center of the resonance peak .",
    "the finite gap in the lowest concentration sample ( @xmath50 ) is due to cross - talk between the two surfaces of the slab , because of computational limitations in the total system size .",
    "the gap region covers what would have been a finite dos due to both the resonance peak and the dirac surface spectrum .",
    "we have carefully checked that such a finite cross - talk gap does not change either the resonance peak weight or the high - energy spectrum features .",
    "we also note that with decreasing impurity concentration the high - energy spectrum becomes smoother . in the lowest concentration sample ,",
    "the high - energy dirac spectrum has become smooth enough to distinguish a clear kink at around @xmath51 . below this kink the linear spectra on each side close at the two dirac points at the base of the resonance peak .",
    "however , above the kink , both the positive and negative linear dirac spectra instead have their apices at @xmath34 . moving closer to the impurity site , the kink position does not change , but the slope above , at higher energies , starts to coincide with the slope below , at lower energies .",
    "therefore , close to the impurity , the two dirac points at the base of the resonance peak are still the only defining parameters for the whole energy spectrum of the surface band .",
    "this is true for any impurity concentration , including the case of an isolated impurity .",
    "however , far from the impurity , the surface - state spectrum located above a kink is  healed \" back to its unperturbed state , i.e. its slope indicates closing at a single dirac point at @xmath34 .",
    "we find that the kink moves to somewhat lower energies as the impurity concentration decreases , such that this  healing \" above the kink takes place at lower energies for more dilute impurities .",
    "since we are unable , at the present moment , to model significantly larger systems than those reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : uvac ] , we can not say anything definitive about the low - energy spectrum far away from a single isolated impurity .",
    "this will depend on the kink position as the impurity concentration decreases",
    ". it would be reasonable to expect that the kink eventually reaches down toward @xmath34 for an isolated impurity , thus leaving little , if any , trace of the impurity resonance and its double dirac points very far from an isolated impurity in any part of the energy spectrum .",
    "above we have established that a large resonance peak resides inbetween two emerging dirac points for strong potential impurities .",
    "thus , the topologically protected dirac surface - state spectrum with a single dirac point is , at least locally , destroyed by such strong potential scatterers .",
    "this might seem surprising as the surface - state is topologically protected from any perturbation that is time - reversal invariant .",
    "however , often forgotten in this line of reasoning is both the finite size of the bulk gap and the fact that the surface and bulk states have a finite spatial overlap in any realistic ti .",
    "together these two effects open up the possibility of virtual excitations to the bulk of the ti . with spin",
    "flips allowed in the bulk , virtual spin - flip bulk excitations give rise to ( the otherwise absent ) backscattering on the surface and thus the topological protection of the dirac point is lost . since the electrostatic energy for strong scatterers can easily surpass that of the bulk gap in real tis",
    ", these bulk - assisted processes can become very common , granted that there is also a sizable spatial overlap between the bulk and surface states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk ] we plot the ldos on nearest - neighbor sites to the impurity across all layers of the slab for both a weak impurity [ fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk](a ) ] and a vacancy [ fig .",
    "[ fig : bulk](b ) ] .    on the opposite surface ( layer 40 )",
    "we see the ldos pattern of an unperturbed dirac cone centered at the chemical potential @xmath11 .",
    "this state slowly joins the bulk states , present at @xmath52 , when penetrating into the slab . at the 10-layer depth the remnant dos from the surface state is less than 0.002 and is also only located at energies close to the bulk gap . on the surface with the impurity ( layer 1 )",
    "we see how the resonance peak significantly modifies the spectrum .",
    "a weak impurity markedly enhances the ldos around its resonance peak , here at @xmath53 , but , to some degree , the ldos is enhanced over the whole energy spectrum in the surface layer . at energies far from the resonance peak ,",
    "the unperturbed dirac spectrum is recovered in subsurface layers . however , close to the resonance peak the ldos is enhanced even deep below the impurity , with traces of the peak found somewhat deeper than the unperturbed surface state . for a vacancy",
    "the bulk penetration is rather similar , but with the notable difference that the resonance peak now sits close to @xmath34 and two new dirac points have emerged on either side of this peak .",
    "thus , our results for a general model of a 3d ti show that both a finite bulk gap and a finite and sizable penetration depth for the surface state ( and the resonance peak ) are present , together giving rise to bulk - assisted scattering .",
    "since the argument on topological protection for the surface state relies on suppressed 180@xmath0 backscattering in the case of 2d scattering , it totally ignores the contributions of 3d scattering processes that engage bulk states .",
    "therefore , there is no inherent protection left for the original dirac point from strong non - magnetic impurities , and the resonance peak at low energies , with the accompanied two dirac points , are simply a consequence of a bulk - surface interaction in the system .",
    "these results show that any realistic solution of the impurity problem in tis has to include a realistic calculation of the bulk contribution , and consequently , the argument for suppressed backscattering also needs to be modified to include bulk - assisted scattering .",
    "we also note that large impurity resonance peaks close to the fermi level are going to be sensitive to strong coulomb interactions , which can lead to spin - polarized splitting and thus spontaneous local time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "however , we leave a detailed analysis of interaction effects for future work .",
    "at this point we would also like to note that scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) results on non - magnetic impurities in bi@xmath54se@xmath55 have recently appeared , confirming the existence of strong resonance states at the dirac point.@xcite    we are grateful to z.  alpichshev , r.  biswas , t.  hanaguri , d.  h. lee , a.  kapitulnik , h.  manoharan , t.  wehling , and s.  c.  zhang for discussions .",
