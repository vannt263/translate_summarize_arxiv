    "sudden cardiac death , attributable to unexpected ventricular arrhythmias , is one of the leading causes of death in the us and kills over 300,000 americans each year @xcite .",
    "the induction and maintenance of ventricular arrhythmias has been linked to single - cell dynamics @xcite . in response to an electrical stimulus , cardiac cells fire an action potential @xcite , which consists of a rapid depolarization of the transmembrane voltage ( v@xmath0 ) followed by a much slower repolarization process before returning to the resting value ( fig . [",
    "fig : action_potential ] ) .",
    "the time interval during which the voltage is elevated is called the action potential duration ( apd ) .",
    "the time between the end of an apd and the beginning of the next one is called the diastolic interval ( di ) . the time interval between two consecutive stimuli is called the basic cycle length ( bcl ) . when the pacing rate is slow , a periodic train of electrical stimuli produces a phase - locked steady - state response , where each stimulus gives rise to an identical action potential ( 1:1 pattern ) .",
    "when the pacing rate becomes sufficiently fast , the 1:1 pattern may be replaced by a 2:2 pattern , so - called electrical alternans @xcite , where the apd alternates between short and long values .",
    "recent experiments have established a causal link between alternans and the risk for ventricular arrhythmias @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding mechanism of alternans is a crucial step in detection and prevention of fatal arrhythmias",
    ".        cellular mechanisms of alternans have been much studied .",
    "summaries on this topic can be found in recent review articles by shiferaw et al .",
    "@xcite and weiss et al .",
    "@xcite . at the cellular level ,",
    "cardiac dynamics involves bidirectional coupling between membrane voltage ( v@xmath0 ) dynamics and intracellular calcium ( ca@xmath1 ) cycling . during an action potential ,",
    "the elevation of v@xmath0 activates l - type ca currents @xmath2 to invoke the elevation of [ ca@xmath1 ] , which in turn triggers ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( sr ) , a procedure known as calcium - induced - calcium release ( cicr ) @xcite .",
    "the v@xmath4ca@xmath1 coupling satisfies graded release , where a larger di leads to an increase in the ca release at the following beat since it allows more time for l - type ca channels to recover . on the other hand , ca release from the sr affects the apd in two folds : to curtail the apd by enhancing the inactivation of l - type ca currents @xmath5 ; and to prolong the apd by intensifying na@xmath6/ca@xmath7 exchange currents @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , depending on the relative contributions of @xmath2 and @xmath8 , an increase in ca release may either shorten the apd ( negative ca@xmath9v@xmath0 coupling ) or lengthen the apd ( positive ca@xmath9v@xmath0 coupling ) @xcite .",
    "there exist two main cellular mechanisms of alternans .",
    "firstly , alternans may be attributed to steep apd restitution @xcite , which is due to a period - doubling instability in the v@xmath0 dynamics . in this case ,",
    "ca@xmath1 transient alternans , as a slave variable , is induced because v@xmath0 regulates [ ca@xmath1 ] via the l - type ca currents and the sodium - calcium exchange currents .",
    "secondly , alternans may be caused by a period - doubling instability in ca@xmath1 cycling , which is associated with a steep relationship between the sarcoplasm reticulum ( sr ) release and sr load @xcite . in this case ,",
    "apd alternans is a secondary effect via ca@xmath9v@xmath0 coupling .",
    "for ease of reference , we call the first mechanism _ apd - driven alternans _ and the second _ ca - driven alternans_. interestingly , apd and ca@xmath1 transient alternans can be electromechanically ( e / m ) in phase or out of phase @xcite . in e / m in - phase alternans",
    ", a long - short - long apd pattern corresponds to a large - small - large [ ca@xmath10 pattern , see fig .",
    "[ fig : em_coupling ] ( a ) .",
    "in contrast , in e / m out - of - phase alternans , a long - short - long apd pattern corresponds to a small - large - small [ ca@xmath1 ] pattern , see fig .",
    "[ fig : em_coupling ] ( b ) . when alternans happens in isolated cells , the bidirectional coupling between apd and ca@xmath1 transient determines the relative phase of apd and ca@xmath1 transient alternans .",
    "in particular , apd - driven alternans always leads to e / m in - phase alternans whereas ca - driven alternans is e / m in phase for positive ca@xmath9v@xmath0 coupling and out of phase for negative ca@xmath9v@xmath0 coupling @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of alternans in multicellular tissue is more complicated since it involves electrotonic coupling and conduction velocity restitution .",
    "of particular interest is a phenomenon called spatially discordant alternans , in which different regions of the tissue alternate out of phase .",
    "discordant alternans is arrhythmogenic because it forms a dynamically heterogeneous substrate that may promote wave break and reentry @xcite . to study the spatiotemporal patterns of alternans , echebarria and karma derived amplitude equations that are based on apd - driven alternans @xcite .",
    "these amplitude equations not only are capable of quantitative predictions but also provide insightful understandings on the arrhythmogenic patterns .",
    "in a recent article , dai and schaeffer @xcite analytically computed the linear spectrum of echebarria and karma s amplitude equations for the cases of small dispersion and long fibers .",
    "spatial patterns of alternans have been investigated in experiments @xcite . recently , aistrup et al .",
    "@xcite used single - photon laser - scanning confocal microscopy to measure ca signaling in individual myocytes .",
    "they found that ca alternans is spatially synchronized at low pacing rates whereas dyssynchronous patterns , where a number of cells are out of phase with adjoining cells , arise when the pacing rate increases .",
    "aistrup et al . also observed subcellular alternans at fast pacing , where ca alternans is spatially dyssynchronous within a cell . using simulations of 1-d homogeneous tissue , sato et al .",
    "@xcite found that , in cardiac fibers with negative ca@xmath11v@xmath0 coupling , ca alternans reverses phase over a length scale of one cell whereas , in fibers with positive ca@xmath11v@xmath0 coupling , ca alternans changes phase over a much larger length scale .",
    "they interpreted this difference by showing that negative ca@xmath11v@xmath0 coupling tends to desynchronize two coupled cells while positive ca@xmath11v@xmath0 coupling tends to synchronize the coupled cells .",
    "motivated by the aforementioned experimental and theoretical work , this paper aims to explore spatial patterns of cardiac alternans . through extensive numerical simulations , we find that complex spatial patterns of ca alternans with phase reversals in adjacent cells can happen in homogeneous fibers with both negative and positive ca@xmath11v@xmath0 couplings .",
    "most surprisingly , we find that the spatiotemporal pattern of cardiac alternans is not determined by the pacing period alone . specifically , when calcium - driven alternans develops in multicellular tissue , there coexist multiple spatiotemporal patterns of alternans regardless of the length of the fiber , the junctional diffusion of ca , and the type of ca@xmath11v@xmath0 coupling .",
    "we further investigate the mechanism that leads to the coexistence of multiple alternans solutions .",
    "our analysis shows that multiple alternans solutions are induced because of the interaction between electrotonic coupling and an instability in ca@xmath1 cycling .",
    "we adopt a model of membrane dynamics that combines the calcium dynamics model developed by shiferaw et al . @xcite and the canine ionic model by fox et al . @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will refer to this model as the shiferaw - fox model .",
    "detailed formulations of the model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the shiferaw - fox model has adopted two sets of parameters in the calcium dynamics to account for negative and positive ca@xmath9v@xmath0 couplings . besides the phase difference",
    ", the two sets of parameters also produce alternans at different values of bcl . using shiferaw s default parameters , we find alternans happens at bcl@xmath12 ms for negative ca@xmath13v@xmath0 coupling and bcl@xmath14 ms for positive ca@xmath9v@xmath0 coupling . fig .",
    "[ fig : ode_bif ] shows the bifurcation diagrams in apd and peak value of [ ca@xmath1 ] for negative ca@xmath9v@xmath0 coupling .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams for positive ca@xmath9v@xmath0 coupling are similar and thus are not shown here .",
    "we note that , in simulations of isolated cells using the shiferaw - fox model , alternans solutions do not depend on the initial condition nor on the pacing history .",
    "however , as we will show in the following , fibers based on the shiferaw - fox model possess multiple alternans solutions , which are sensitive to the initial condition and the pacing protocol .",
    "[ c]cc &   + ( a ) & ( b )      we study paced , homogeneous fibers , which can be modeled using the cable equation:@xmath15 where @xmath16 represents v@xmath0 , @xmath17 @xmath18ms represents the effective diffusion coefficient of @xmath16 in the fiber , @xmath19 @xmath20@xmath21 represents the transmembrane capacitance , @xmath22 is the total ionic current , and @xmath23 represents the external current stimulus .",
    "the ionic current @xmath22 is computed using the shiferaw - fox model .",
    "the current stimulus has duration 1 ms and amplitude 80 @xmath24a/@xmath24f .",
    "this paper studies fibers of various lengths . for two coupled cells ,",
    "we pace the left cell . for longer fibers",
    ", we pace the leftmost few cells to ensure propagation . for example , the leftmost 5 cells are paced in simulating a fiber of 100 cells .",
    "the cable equation ( [ eqn : voltage ] ) is solved using the finite difference method with a space step of @xmath25 cm and time step of @xmath26 ms .",
    "no - flux boundary conditions are imposed at both ends of the fiber @xcite .      to study the onset and development of alternans , we pace both single cells and fibers of various lengths with several pacing protocols , which are briefly described below .",
    "\\(i ) in the _ downsweep protocol _ @xcite ,",
    "the cell / fiber is paced periodically with period bcl until it reaches steady state .",
    "then , the pacing period is reduced by @xmath27b and the procedure is repeated many times . note that this protocol is also known as _ dynamic pacing protocol _ @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the _ perturbed downsweep protocol _ , proposed by kalb et al .",
    "@xcite , can be regarded as a perturbation to the downsweep protocol . at each pacing period bcl ,",
    "the cell / fiber is first paced n beats to reach steady state . then",
    ", a longer pacing period is applied at the n+1st pacing , after which the original pacing period is applied for 10 beats to allow the tissue to recover its previous steady state .",
    "next , a shorter pacing period is applied and followed by 10 beats of the original pacing period .",
    "finally , the pacing period is reduced by @xmath27b and the procedure is repeated .",
    "\\(iii ) to explore the possibility for multiple alternans solutions , we set up certain initial condition and pace the tissue with period bcl to reach steady state , a process we call _ direct pacing_.    \\(iv ) to explore the origin of an alternans pattern , we use the _ upsweep protocol _",
    "@xcite , which is a reversed downsweep protocol .",
    "we simulate fibers using the shiferaw - fox model with both negative and positive ca@xmath9v@xmath0 couplings under various conditions .",
    "default parameters in shiferaw s code @xcite are used unless otherwise specified . despite quantitatively significant differences , we find both types of couplings lead to the coexistence of multiple alternans solutions . for clarity ,",
    "we start with the results for negative ca@xmath13v@xmath0 coupling and defer the results for positive ca@xmath9v@xmath0 coupling in a later subsection .",
    "we first consider a homogeneous fiber of 100 cells with negative ca@xmath9v@xmath0 coupling . to our surprise",
    ", numerical simulations show that when the fiber is in alternans , there coexist multiple solutions for a given pacing period .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : dtype100 ] shows 6 selected solutions of alternans for the fiber paced at bcl=@xmath28  ms . here",
    ", the steady - state solutions in panels ( a - c ) are obtained using the downsweep protocol with step size @xmath27b=1 ms , 2 ms , and 25 ms , respectively .",
    "the pacing protocols are started from bcl=500 ms in ( a ) and ( c ) and from bcl=499 ms in ( b ) .",
    "we note that the solution of a downsweep protocol is not influenced by the initial condition at the starting , long bcl ; instead , the solution is sensitive to the step size @xmath27b .",
    "the steady - state solutions in panels ( d - f ) are obtained by pacing the fiber at bcl=@xmath28  ms with prescribed initial conditions for @xmath29 beats , the so - called direct pacing .",
    "the initial condition of the fiber in panel ( d ) is uniform , i.e. , all cells are assigned the same resting voltage , gating variables , and ionic concentrations . the initial condition in panel ( e )",
    "is same as that in ( d ) except that [ ca@xmath1 ] is assigned to be @xmath30 @xmath24 m for the first 35 cells and @xmath31 @xmath24 m for the remaining cells .",
    "interestingly , this initial condition leads to a steady - state [ ca@xmath1 ] pattern , which , besides the phase reversal between cells 35 and 36 , has another phase reversal between cells 11 and 12 .",
    "the initial condition in panel ( f ) is the same as that in ( d ) except that [ ca@xmath1 ] is randomly assigned for cells on the fiber according to a uniform distribution in the interval of @xmath32 @xmath24 m to @xmath33 @xmath24 m . in all protocols ,",
    "we pace the fiber for 200 beats at each bcl and plot the last 10 beats at bcl=375 ms .",
    "the simulation results in fig . [ fig : dtype100 ] demonstrate that the alternans on a fiber is not solely determined by the pacing period .",
    "instead , the solution is sensitive to the pacing protocol and the initial condition .",
    "it is worth noting that , besides the solutions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtype100 ] , there exist many other solution patterns .",
    "in particular , there exist many complex patterns similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : dtype100 ] ( f ) . in the following",
