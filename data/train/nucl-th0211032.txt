    "@xcite , monopole , dipole and quadrupole isoscalar ( is ) and isovector ( iv ) giant resonances in stable and drip line , particularly neutron drip line nuclei , were studied by using the self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf)calculation plus random phase approximation ( rpa ) with skyrme interaction , and both the is and iv correlations were taken into account simultaneously .",
    "it was found that for both @xmath5-stable and drip line nuclei the giant resonances can be well described by the collective model @xcite . for neutron drip line nuclei ,",
    "however , there is appreciable amount of low - lying strengths just above threshold and these low - lying strengths are nearly pure neutron unperturbed excitations .",
    "for example , in ref@xcite , the quadrupole strength of the neutron drip line nucleus @xmath3 was analyzed and it was pointed out that there exists a so - called threshold strength , which is not of collective character and comes from the excitations of excess neutrons with small binding energies . in a recent publication @xcite , the low - lying octupole excitation of the neutron skin nucleus @xmath6 was studied and it was pointed out the low - lying ( @xmath7 ) is octupole states appear as collective excitation and are shifted down to very low energy region , due to the disappearance of the n=50 magic number .",
    "low - lying octupole excitations usually consist of transitions from occupied states to bound states , resonance states and nonresonance states . in this paper",
    ", we make a detailed study of low - lying ( @xmath7 ) octupole excitations of the @xmath8stable nucleus @xmath9 , the neutron skin nucleus @xmath6 and the drip line nucleus @xmath10 .",
    "it can be seen that in all these nuclei , the low - lying octupole states near threshold appear as the coexistence of the collective excitations and the decoupled strong continuum strength .",
    "the properties of these low - lying states can be understood from the point of view of particle - vibration coupling .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical formalism of hf plus rpa calculation is described in section 2 .",
    "numerical results and discussions are shown in section 3 .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "the unperturbed strength function is defined by@xcite @xmath11 while rpa strength function is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the noninteracting p - h green function , and @xmath14 is the rpa response function including the effect of the coupling to the continuum , @xmath15    in eqs .",

    "this means that the normalized tassie transition density should give the same strength as that of rpa state .    in the present work ,",
    "the properties of low - lying octupole excitations are studied from particle - vibration coupling . for octupole excitation",
    ", we use the radial dependence of the particle - vibration coupling    @xmath33    or @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the hf potential and @xmath36 is the ground state density .",
    "eq.([pv1 ] ) has been successfully used for the coupling of particle to shape oscillations in ref.@xcite .",
    "the sign of the ratio @xmath37 determines the influence of particle - vibration coupling on the strength of the unperturbed @xmath38 excitations@xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the ratio is a measure of how strongly the unperturbed strength of this @xmath38 excitation is modified by performing rpa calculation .",
    "if the ratio is equal to zero , the unperturbed strength of this @xmath38 transition will remain unchanged by the rpa correlation .",
    "we first perform the hf calculation with the skm@xmath39 interaction and then use the rpa with the same interaction including simultaneously both the is and the iv correlation .",
    "it is solved in the coordinate space with the green s function method , taking into account the continuum exactly .",
    "the calculated unperturbed strengths of @xmath9 , @xmath6 and @xmath10 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] . in the harmonic oscillator model ,",
    "the low - lying octupole strength ( @xmath7 ) is approximately equal to the high - lying ( @xmath40 ) strength in the large @xmath41 limit , and the low - lying and high - lying octupole strengths approximately exhaust @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the energy weighted sum rule , respectively . in real @xmath0stable nuclei @xmath41",
    "is finite and the low - lying strength is less than that predicted by harmonic oscillator model in the large @xmath41 limit . from fig.[fig.1](a )",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath9 , the unperturbed low - lying ( @xmath7 ) strength is centered at about 8 mev and spread over the same order of energy range .",
    "it exhausts approximately @xmath44 of total strength .",
    "the high - lying ( @xmath45 ) strength is centered at about 24 mev and exhausts approximately @xmath46 of total strength . for @xmath6 , the unperturbed strength ( see fig.[fig.1](b ) ) spreads over an energy range from 2 mev to 15 mev and exhausts about @xmath46 of total strength .",
    "while for @xmath10 ( see fig.[fig.1](c ) ) , except a few high - lying proton excitations , nearly all of the octupole strength lies within the low energy region . for @xmath6 and @xmath10 , large amount of neutron unperturbed octupole strengths",
    "are shifted down to very low energy region .",
    "this downward shifting of the octupole strengths is attributed to the disappearance of magic number n=50 for @xmath6 as shown in fig.[fig.2](a ) , and the disappearance of magic numbers n=20 and n=28 for @xmath10 as shown in fig.[fig.2](b ) .",
    "for all the three nuclei , the calculated energy weighted sum rules are equal to the classical sum rules to a good accuracy .    in fig.[fig.2 ]",
    ", one - particle energies are given with fixed neutron number for ( a)n=20 and ( b)n=40 as a function of proton number .",
    "it is easy to see that in fig.[fig.2](a ) , when it is near the neutron drip line , the magic number n=20 is disappearing , which agrees with the experimental observation@xcite , and new magic number n=16 appears , which is consistent with the conclusion in ref.@xcite .",
    "similar phenomena appear also in fig.[fig.2](b ) . near the neutron drip line",

    ", it can be seen that the is and iv octupole excitations are surface modes and they are well described by the collective model . for the strong collective",
    "is state at 3.48 mev in fig.4(a ) and fig.5(a ) , there are some difference between two models at small @xmath52 , but in the surface region with @xmath52 at about 7 @xmath53 , this excitation can well be described by the bohr - tassie model .    in neutron - excess nuclei",
    ", the is mode ( shape vibration ) gives rise to a iv moment which is proportional to @xmath54 , so the strength of an is mode carries iv strength , and the ratio of iv strength / is strength is expected to be @xmath4 as pointed in refs .",
    "we calculated this ratio for collective is modes at ex=3.48 mev and giant is resonance around ex=20.5 mev in @xmath9 .",
    "both modes give the ratios @xmath55 to a good accuracy .    for @xmath6 ( fig.[fig.3](b ) )",
    ", the main is strengths are shifted down to low energy region .",
    "below 5 mev there are 4 strong is peaks and one of them is below threshold ( ex=1.91 mev ) .",
    "> from the transition densities and radial current components in fig.[fig.6 ] , the is collective state at ex=1.91 mev can be described by the bohr - tassie model . the transition densities and radial current components of the other three",
    "is peaks below 5 mev are shown in fig.[fig.7 ] and fig.[fig.8 ] , respectively .",
    "> from fig.[fig.7 ] it can be seen that these three is peaks are surface modes and both neutrons and protons contribute .",
    "this indicates they are collective . in the central region of the nucleus",
    "there are differences between the transition densities of the bohr - tassie model and those of rpa calculation .",
    "but in the surface region the results of rpa calculation are similar to those of collective model . from fig.[fig.8 ] we see that for the currents , the bohr - tassie model results differ from the ones from rpa substantially , even in the surface region . for example , in our rpa calculation the small component @xmath56 is comparable to the large component @xmath57 , but the bohr - tassi model gives @xmath58 .",
    "this difference will be explained from the viewpoint of particle - vibration coupling later .",
    "the ratios of iv strength / is strength for these 4 strong is peaks ( below 5 mev in @xmath2 are also calculated .",
    "we find that , however , unlike the case in @xmath0stable nucleus @xmath9 , the calculated ratios are larger than @xmath4 by factor 2 to 4 .",
    "this result is closely related to the neutron orbits of small binding energies and they push down the unperturbed octupole strengths to very low energy region .    for @xmath10 ( see fig.[fig.3](c ) ) , the high - lying is giant resonance nearly disappears and almost all the is octupole strengths are shifted down to low energy .",
    "the transition densities and radial current components for the lowest three peaks are shown in fig.[fig.9 ] and fig.[fig.10 ] , respectively . from fig.[fig.9 ] we see that the three peaks are surface modes and both protons and neutrons contribute . in fig.[fig.1 ] and fig.[fig.3 ] we notice that the is strengths of these peaks are larger than those of unperturbed ones , which shows they are collective .",
    "the bohr - tassie model can approximately describe the transition densities in the surface region .",
    "the bohr - tassie model gives quite different currents properties for these is peaks in fig.[fig.10 ] .",
    "the reason will be analyzed later .",
    "we also calculated the ratios of iv strength / is strength for these three is peaks .",
    "the calculated values are factor 3 to 5 larger than @xmath4 in @xmath3 .",
    "similar to @xmath2 , this is also related to the least bound neutrons .",
    "next we try to understand the collective properties of these low - lying is excitations in @xmath2 and @xmath3 based on the particle - vibration coupling .",
    "we have checked that the signs of the ratio eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) in our cases are always positive , so we only consider their absolute values here .",
    "fig.[fig.11 ] shows a few low - lying neutron unperturbed octupole strengths in @xmath2 for radial operators @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and fig.[fig.12 ] shows the corresponding quantities for @xmath10 . here where @xmath35 is the neutron radial hf potential and @xmath36 is the ground state density .",
    "> from fig.[fig.11 ] we see that for the transition from bound state to nonresonance state , @xmath62 , there is a pronounced peak in octupole strength function for radial operator @xmath63 , but almost no peaks for the other two radial operators @xmath64 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "just like the transitions from bound states to bound states , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , there are strong peaks of octupole strengths for all three radial operators in corresponding energy region for the transitions from bound states to resonance states , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , .",
    "it means that the ratios eq . ( [ ratio ] ) for transitions to nonresonance states are much smaller than those for the transitions to resonance states and to bound states . in rpa calculation",
    "the unperturbed octupole strength of the radial operator @xmath59 for the transition from bound state to nonresonance state @xmath69 will hardly be affected , but the strengths of the radial operator @xmath59 for the transitions from bound states to resonance states and to bound states will be strongly absorbed into the collective excitations . because the unperturbed octupole strength of the transition from bound state to nonresonance state @xmath70 for radial operator @xmath59 is mainly distributed within the energy region from 3.0 mev to 4.5 mev , there is the coexistence of the collective excitations and the decoupled strong continuum strength near the threshold in these three lowest is peaks .",
    "that is why the bohr - tassie model can only well describe the transition density of rpa calculation in the surface region for the low - lying excitations in @xmath2 , but it can not well describe the calculated transition current .",

    "( [ ratio ] ) is much smaller than those for transitions from bound states to resonance states , @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in these",
    "three lowest is peaks , there is the coexistence of the collective excitations and the decoupled strong continuum strength near the threshold .",
    "that is the reason why the bohr - tassie model can only approximately describe the calculated transition density in the surface region for the three lowest is peaks in @xmath10 , but it can not well describe the transition current of our calculation .",
    "the octupole vibrations for the @xmath0stable nucleus @xmath9 , the neutron skin nucleus @xmath6 and the drip line nucleus @xmath10 are studied .",
    "it is found that the lowest is excitation below threshold for the nuclei @xmath9 and @xmath6 , and is and iv giant resonances of the @xmath74-stable nucleus @xmath9 can be well described by collective model , at least in the surface region .    for the neutron skin nucleus @xmath6 and the neutron drip line nucleus @xmath75 ,",
    "there exist strengths of transitions from bound states to bound states , resonance states , and nonresonance states in the low - lying unperturbed neutron octupole strength ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the strengths of transitions to nonresonance states are nearly unaffected and the strengths of other transitions are strongly absorbed into collective states by taking into account the rpa correlation .",
    "so there is the coexistence of the collective excitations and the decoupled strong continuum strength near the threshold in the lowest is states .",
    "we also find that , for the @xmath0stable nucleus @xmath9 , both low - lying is states and giant is resonances carry iv component and the ratios of iv strength / is strength are equal to @xmath4 to good accuracy , but for the neutron skin nucleus @xmath6 and the neutron drip line nucleus @xmath10 , these ratios for a few lowest strong is excitations are much larger than @xmath4 .",
    "these results are closely related to the small binding energies of neutron orbits in these nuclei .",
    "the octupole transitions from these orbits are mainly distributed in low energy region , so the contribution to low - lying ( @xmath7 ) octupole states from neutrons are much larger than those from protons .",
