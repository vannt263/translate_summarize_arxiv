    "it is widely believed that there are supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies , and these are hypothesized to be the central engines for active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "two main possibilities are considered as the energy source .",
    "one is the gravitational energy of accreting matter and the other is the rotational energy of the black hole or the accretion disk surrounding it .",
    "however , the details of the energy extraction process are not clear .",
    "it is also not understood well how the energy is converted into that of agns or grbs .",
    "blandford and znajek showed that the rotational energy of a rotating black hole can be extracted in the form of poynting flux along magnetic field lines penetrating the event horizon  @xcite , which is known as the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism .",
    "its efficiency depends on the rotational velocity of the black hole and the configuration of the magnetic field : the extraction of the rotational energy becomes more efficient the more magnetic field lines penetrates the event horizon and the more rapidly the black hole rotates . in the bz mechanism ,",
    "poloidal magnetic fields which penetrate the event horizon play a crucial role for the energy extraction as well as for the formation of jets associated with agns .",
    "in fact , some numerical studies reported that poynting - dominated jets were produced  @xcite .",
    "bick and janis showed that a magnetic field without an electric current is expelled from the event horizon of a maximally rotating black hole  @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the meissner effect in a superconductor .",
    "this effect for a rapidly rotating black hole would decrease the efficiency of the bz mechanism , though the larger rotational velocity of the black hole would increase the efficiency .",
    "in realistic astrophysical cases , however , there would be plasma around the black hole .",
    "how the meissner - like effect is affected by the existence of plasma is the main subject of this paper .",
    "we clarify the effect of an electric current on the meissner - like effect of an extreme black hole .",
    "komissarov and mckinney studied numerically the meissner - like effect of a kerr black hole  @xcite .",
    "they carried out numerical simulations for a highly conductive magnetosphere until it almost reaches steady state , and there was no sign of the meissner - like effect in their numerical results .",
    "in this paper , we study how an electric current affects the meissner - like effect by solving a stationary problem analytically .",
    "since realistic situations are , in general , very complicated , it is difficult to model them . in order to reveal the essence of the plasma effect",
    ", we consider a very simple toy model : ( i ) we consider a stationary , axisymmetric force - free system of the electromagnetic field and plasma ; ( ii ) we consider a static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime with a degenerate horizon as a background spacetime rather than a rotating black hole . the degenerate horizon is the origin of the meissner - like effect in a vacuum black hole spacetime  @xcite , and hence , by studying the electromagnetic field in this spacetime , we can see whether the meissner - like effect remains even in the case with an electric current .",
    "the spacetime considered in this paper is known as the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) spacetime . by these assumptions ,",
    "the basic equations reduce to only one quasi - linear elliptic equation for the magnetic flux function called the grad - shafranov ( gs ) equation  @xcite .    for the black hole spacetime",
    ", the gs equation has three regular singular points : one is at the event horizon , and the other two are at the inner and outer light surfaces on which the velocities of the magnetic field lines agree with the speed of light . for non - extreme cases ,",
    "one boundary condition is imposed at each regular singular point so that the magnetic field is smooth everywhere .",
    "however , for a given electric current function , the obtained solution for the magnetic flux need not be @xmath0 but at most @xmath1  @xcite . although numerical @xmath0 solutions have been obtained by iteratively changing the functional form of the electric current  @xcite , a mathematically rigorous proof for the existence of a @xmath0 solution has not yet been presented .",
    "furthermore , in the extreme case , two kinds of boundary condition must be imposed at once on the event horizon .",
    "we shall mention all these difficulties in solving the gs equation in  iv .    as will be shown in ",
    "v , the monopole component is a unique configuration of the magnetic field on the event horizon if there is not an electric current .",
    "since there is no magnetic monopole in nature , this result implies the meissner - like effect of the extreme rn black hole . in order to study the electromagnetic field",
    "coupled to an electric current around an rn black hole , we use a perturbative method which includes two expansion parameters .",
    "one of these parameters corresponds to the rotational angular velocity of the magnetic fields .",
    "namely , we consider slow - rotating magnetic fields as was first considered by blandford and znajek  @xcite . the other parameter is the ratio of the distance from the event horizon to the horizon radius , since we consider only the vicinity of the event horizon , which includes the inner light surface .",
    "although we can not take into account the outer light surface in our perturbative method , we can obtain approximate solutions sufficient to study the meissner - like effect with an electric current .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "ii , we introduce the rn black hole as a background geometry .",
    "then we show the gs equation for the rn spacetime in  iii ; the detailed derivation of the gs equation is given in appendices a and b. the regularity conditions for the gs equation and difficulties in solving this equation are described in detail in  iv . using perturbative analyses",
    ", we study the cases with and without an electric current in  v and vi , respectively .",

    "in general , the gs equation for a black hole magnetosphere has three regular singular points : one is at the event horizon @xmath10 , and the other two are at the light surfaces defined by @xmath33 .",
    "a light surface is a timelike hypersurface on which the rotational speed of magnetic field lines are equal to the speed of light .",
    "the inner light surface given by a function @xmath34 has a spacelike section with spherical topology , whereas the outer one , @xmath35 , has that of cylindrical topology .    in the case of the kerr spacetime , the kerr - schild coordinate system is often adopted , for example , in numerical simulations ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , since there is no coordinate singularity on the event horizon .",
    "therefore , we give the kerr - schild coordinate system for the rn spacetime in appendix [ ks ] . in appendix",
    "[ ks ] , we show that the singular point on the event horizon in the gs equation appears even if we adopt kerr - schild coordinates .",
    "this is also true in the case of the kerr spacetime , though it is not shown in this paper ( we will show it elsewhere ) .",
    "as long as a stationary magnetic field is considered , the singular point of the basic equation will appear on the event horizon , since there is no timelike killing vector field on or inside the event horizon , or in other words , the stationary configuration can not be realized inside the black hole .",
    "in this section , we consider only the case of @xmath36 .",
    "then , by virtue of the symmetry of the background spacetime , without loss of generality , we may assume @xmath37 .",

    "the conditions ( [ eq : neumann ] ) become neumann boundary conditions on the light surfaces .    here , we consider the non - extreme case @xmath66 . let us assume that the functional form of @xmath67 has already been determined before solving the gs equation .",
    "then , by solving the horizon regularity condition ( [ eq : h - regularity ] ) , we obtain @xmath30 on the event horizon . since @xmath30 is the magnetic flux through the polar cap ( see appendix b ) , @xmath30 should vanish at @xmath39 .",
    "thus , there seems to be no freedom for setting a boundary condition for @xmath30 in solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - regularity ] ) , but this is not true . since @xmath39 is a regular singular point of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - regularity ] ) , there still remains one degree of freedom for choosing a boundary value of the second - order derivative of @xmath30 .",
    "hence , a dirichlet boundary condition for the gs equation is determined on the event horizon by the regularity condition ( [ eq : h - regularity ] ) . by imposing this dirichlet boundary condition at @xmath50 and further neumann boundary conditions at @xmath68 ( [ eq : neumann ] ) and on the equatorial plane ( e.g. , the reflection - symmetric boundary condition @xmath69 ) , a solution for the gs equation ( [ eq : gs - eq ] ) is uniquely determined in the domain @xmath70 . by imposing two neumann boundary conditions ( [ eq : neumann ] ) on the two light surfaces @xmath71 and the equatorial plane @xmath72 , and a further dirichlet boundary condition @xmath73 on the symmetry axis @xmath39 , a solution for the gs equation is uniquely determined in the domain @xmath74 .",
    "for the domain @xmath75 , if we impose a boundary condition at @xmath30 for @xmath76 , then we can obtain a solution for the gs equation .",
    "the gs equation can be solved for these three domains , @xmath77 , @xmath74 , and @xmath78 , independently by the above procedure ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : non - extreme ] ) .",
    "thus , for an arbitrary electric current @xmath67 , the obtained solution for @xmath30 is , in general , not @xmath0 but at most @xmath1 at the boundaries @xmath71 .",
    "it was first reported by contopoulos , kazanas , and fendt ( ckf ) that the continuity of the first - order derivative of @xmath30 at the light surface as well as the continuity of @xmath30 itself determines the functional form of the electric current @xmath67 in the case of the pulsar magnetosphere  @xcite .",
    "they numerically obtained @xmath0 solutions for @xmath30 by an iterative method in which both @xmath30 and the functional form of @xmath67 are determined simultaneously .",
    "the ckf method was used by several authors to study the pulsar magnetosphere and they showed that this method also suitable for their case of interest  @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that a mathematically rigorous proof for the existence of the @xmath0 solution for the gs equation has not yet been given .",
    "although there is at most one light surface in the case of the pulsar magnetosphere , there can be two light surfaces if @xmath24 is a non - vanishing constant in the case of the black hole magnetosphere ( see fig .  [ fg : non - extreme ] ) .",
    "thus , if we chose the functional form of @xmath67 such that @xmath30 is @xmath0 in the domain @xmath79 , imposing an asymptotic boundary condition for @xmath76 does not guarantee the continuity of the derivative of @xmath30 at the outer light surface @xmath80 .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a solution which is @xmath0 in the domain @xmath81 , we need to solve the gs equation for the outermost domain @xmath82 as a cauchy problem with a boundary data for @xmath30 and the derivatives of @xmath30 on @xmath80 .",
    "this implies that we can not impose the asymptotic boundary condition for @xmath83 . in general",
    ", it is difficult to solve an elliptic - type differential equation numerically , such as the gs equation , as a cauchy problem due to the numerical instability .",
    "thus , in the case with two light surfaces , it is difficult to numerically obtain a solution for the gs equation in the outermost domain @xmath84 .",
    "however , this might not be a serious problem , since we may understand whether the blandford - znajek mechanism works by studying only the domain @xmath85 .",
    "uzdensky applied the ckf method to the magnetospheres of the schwarzschild black hole  @xcite and of the kerr black hole  @xcite , but he focused on only the cases in which there is only one light surface by virtue of a particular assumption on @xmath24 : uzdensky assumed that @xmath24 asymptotically decreases , and hence there is no outer light surface .",
    "thus , uzdensky succeeded in numerically obtaining global solutions without solving cauchy problems for the gs equation .      , but for an extreme rn black hole @xmath86 .",

    ", we also assume that @xmath24 is constant . the horizon regularity conditions ( [ eq : h - regularity-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : h - regularity-2 ] ) give boundary values of @xmath30 and the derivative of @xmath30 .",
    "thus , in the extreme case , we must solve the gs equation ( [ eq : gs - eq ] ) as a cauchy problem even for the domain @xmath87 ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : extreme ] ) . as mentioned",
    ", it is difficult to numerically solve the gs equation as a cauchy problem , and hence , it seems to be difficult to numerically obtain a solution for the physically important domain @xmath88 in the extreme case .",
    "further , even if we find a procedure for numerically solving the gs equation as a cauchy problem , the regularity condition on the inner light surface @xmath68 may not be satisfied for an arbitrary functional form of electric current @xmath67 : we must assume the functional form of @xmath67 to solve the gs equation as a cauchy problem , but , in general , the assumed electric current @xmath67 does not satisfy the regularity condition on the inner light surface . as a result",
    ", it seems to be impossible to obtain a solution for the gs equation numerically , which is finite on the inner light surface , in the extreme case . in this sense , the perturbative analytic approach discussed in ",
    "vi is very important .",
    "we should note that even if we find analytically the electric current @xmath40 which guarantees the finiteness of @xmath30 and its derivative on the inner light surface , such a electric current @xmath40 might not guarantee the finiteness of both @xmath30 and its derivative on the outer light surface .",
    "this implies that either the force - free condition should break down near the outer light surface or the rotational velocity should decay far from the black hole so that the outer light surface does not exist , as in the situation studied by uzdensky .",
    "in this section , we consider the vacuum case @xmath89 .      here , we consider the case of @xmath38 on the event horizon , @xmath90 .",
    "even if @xmath24 does not vanish except on the event horizon , it satisfies @xmath91 thus , on the event horizon , @xmath92 or @xmath93 should hold . in the former case , @xmath30 vanishes on the event horizon , implying that the magnetic flux does not penetrate the event horizon . in the latter case , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gs - eq ] ) , in order that @xmath30 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are finite on the event horizon , the following equation should be satisfied : @xmath94 in the extreme case , since @xmath95 also holds on the event horizon @xmath56 , we have @xmath96 the solution of the above equation which satisfies the regularity condition on the symmetry axis @xmath39 is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is an integration constant .",
    "the above solution implies that the magnetic field which can penetrate the event horizon is the only monopole component .",
    "by contrast to the extreme case , non - monopole components can penetrate the event horizon in the non - extreme case , since , in this case , eq .  ( [ eq : h - regularity-0 ] ) does not necessarily imply @xmath99 . as a result , we can conclude that the meissner - like effect of the extreme black hole appears in the vacuum case .    in the case that @xmath24 vanishes everywhere , we can obtain global solutions .",
    "the solutions which satisfy the regularity condition on the symmetry axis @xmath39 are written in the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the associated legendre function of the first kind with @xmath102 .",

    "if the angular velocity of the magnetic field is constant , two light surfaces necessarily exist .",
