    "_ dblp _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) is an online database system regarding bibliographic entries of scientific publications inside computer science .",
    "it maintains publications of single authors or a set of authors , it is public and offers a retrieval interface to query publication entries . since march 2008 , more than one million entries have been added to the database .",
    "the first publications are of 1936 , the latest of 2008 .",
    "an intelligent dblp core gathers data from known conferences , collecting entries from electronic publications . interpreting each publication as a data stream element ( the authors share some time together , converse , and",
    "produce a result ) , then this refers to similar problems and challenges given above .",
    "we have performed association discovery of dblp entries throughout on a yearly basis for the last 72 years .",
    "this is because the data set has a certain size and is therefore more expressive than a data set on a monthly basis , but more precise than a less fine - granulated discretisation .",
    "the calculation of association rules has been done by using a sample in a way that we firstly set the _ item set frequency _ threshold to 0.1% and secondly the _ bayesian probability value _ threshold to 5% .",
    "thirdly , since the number of received rules has still been tremendously high , we filtered some of them by taking the _ lift _ - representing the proportion of the bayesian probability and the statistically independent case of an association rule @xmath0 . in this respect ,",
    "the number of scientific contributions had been downsized ; we got a distribution curve having the pike in 1972 .",
    "although the publication of a scientific paper has a delay of a several months ( submission date , evaluation period , publication ) , we counted each scientific paper to the year it has appeared . following the yearly calculation of associative rules - beginning from 1936 and ending in 2007 - a various number of patterns occurred .",
    "some of them are presented in figure [ fig : ximg-14 ] , showing the distribution of the publishing authors in the year of 1994 .",
    "the publishing communities in 1994 are mainly characterized by a central _ star _ consisting of many author nodes .",
    "generally , the observations we have done , produced a diverse number patterns that are often quite similar and that base on very simple geometric structures .",
    "most interestingly , patterns went away but appeared again , they stayed stable or disappeared forever .",
    "for example , the big star ( figure [ fig : ximg-14 ] ) has not been existing before 1955 , but appeared several times afterwards , for example in 1994 , disappeared temporarily , and appeared again in 2006 ( _ visiting pattern _ ) .",
    "simple structures like in figure [ fig : ximg-1 ] are present continuously ( _ constant pattern _ ) , without any temporal break : this sounds interesting in the first moment , but in fact , it simply reflects a certain kind of noise within the set of results .",
    "following our observations , we typify each associative pattern to their fundamental structure , and - since these structures are evocative of chemical basic modules - we label them in almost the same manner .",
    "each author node @xmath1 corresponds to an _ atomic author nucleus _ , owning a certain activation @xmath2 and a number of atomic bonds with other nuclei . in the following model description , we keep these bonds unvalued although the strengthen between the adjacent atomic author nuclei exists per se .",
    "\\a )   b )     as presented in figure [ fig : ximg-1 ] , we call such a connection a _ single atomic bond _ , as it describes the relationship between two _ author nuclei _ on the lowest level , being single - directed .",
    "furthermore , we call a relationship a _ double atomic bond _ , if the relationship between two authors is undirected ( see figure [ fig : ximg-1 ] ) in a sense that both the association between author nuclei a and b and b and a , respectively , are frequent .",
    "both structures define the _ fundamental molecular structure _ between two adjacent _ nuclei_. in case , that two _ nuclei _ share two _ single atomic bonds _ of different direction , we call this undirected relationship a _ bridge_. all these molecules are called _ 2-ary _ since only two _ atoms _ are involved .    as for this , any combination of atomic structures results in further _ molecules _ , being of different granularity and size . in general",
    ", we understand molecules as expressive in respect to their arity .",
    "some examples of 2-ary _ fundamental molecules _ are presented in figure [ fig : ximg-4 ] .",
    "on the left , an atomic nucleus @xmath3 is being arranged as a centre of @xmath4 adjacent nuclei .",
    "we call this molecule structure a _ molecule star _ , meaning that the inner nuclei is dependent on each adjacent nuclei : following the meaning of the bond , a publication of @xmath3 has always been done under the condition that someone else has published . in case that a _ author nucleus _ is connected to only disjunctive _ nuclei _ sharing no other _ bonds _ , then the _ author nucleus _ is still being 2-ary , otherwise n - ary .",
    "\\a )   + b )   +",
    "c )     for figure [ fig : ximg-4 ] , we observe on the right side a _ molecule star _ is the opposite of the previous one as @xmath3 is the originator of any publication , being the condition that others publish . with this",
    ", we differentiate between different roles of a _ nucleus _ :    * an _ author nucleus _ a is a _ trigger _ if a influences another author b : @xmath0 * an _ author nucleus _ a is a _ reactor _ if a is is influenced by another author b : @xmath5 * two _ author nuclei _ a and b define a _ bridge _",
    "if they share a _",

    "with the defined predicates and functions we are then able to decompose _",
    "molecular structures_. in this sense , _ molecular stars _ can be seen communities that consist of an arbitrary number of triggers and reactors ; and a _ molecular diamond _ is nothing else than a composition of bridges . furthermore , a decomposition of _ molecular structures _",
    "can then be performed quite easily , leaving to a number of descriptive attributes like shown in table [ tab : attributes ] .",
    "figure [ fig : ximg-27 ] briefly displays a selection of molecular structures that have appeared over the years . for structure [ fig : ximg-27]a ) , we notice a mixture of _ molecular diamonds _ and _ molecular stars _ , for structure [ fig : ximg-27]c ) a mixture of _ molecular bridges _ and _ atomic bonds _ , and for structure [ fig : ximg-27]d ) three bridges only , concentrated on one node .",

    ", we demand on decomposing each publishing community and to describe a _ publishing community _ by the molecular attributes .",
    "applying such a data table containing a description for molecular structures with clustering , we may then get groups of molecular structures being similar .",
    "the advantage of such an analytical performance is a simplification of existing molecular communities in respect to their structure .",
    "the immediate identification of roles in social communities is shown in figure [ fig : ximg-38 ] : here , we may observe _ molecular diamonds _ and _ molecular stars _",
    ", having _ micha sharir _ as _ molecular trigger _ for seven other authors .",
    "furthermore , _",
    "carlos sanchez _ is both a _ molecular trigger _ and a _ molecular reactor _ , whereas _",
    "eric dubois _",
    ", _ phillipe dubois _ , and _",
    "michael petit _ form a _ molecular diamond_.        a more complex scenario can be observed in [ fig : ximg-42 ] , which references to the _",
    "big star_. this _ big star _ is often present over many years , referencing a huge community sharing publications . for this , this structure symbolizes fruitful years with strong interrelations and cooperations .",
    "we may observe that the _ big star _ is nothing else than a composition of many _",
    "author nuclei _ in its inner centre , being connected to external _",
    "nuclei_. moreover , we may observe these _ nuclei _ , being either a _ reactor _",
    ", a _ trigger _ or both .",
    "overall , the molecule is composed of different levels , representing an increasing importance , the more concentrated a nucleus is positioned .",
    "one nucleus in the core has much more a trigger function than a node outside , and the influence concerning a directing of research might be stronger , if we admit that this can be influenced by publications .",
    "initially , we observe very simple _ molecules _ in the years before 1950 , because less publications have been made .",
    "the first _ molecular bridge _ can be observed in 1953 , the first more complex structure in 1954 .",
    "the evolvement remembers to cell division operations of natural processes , leading to a first _ big star _ in 1960 .",
    "interestingly , the _ molecular noise _ ( pairwise , but disjunctive publication , not sharing publications with others ) is present the whole time , continuously staying on a similar percentage .",
    "furthermore , the years of e.g. 1961 , 1975 , 1978 , 1991 , and 1993 are of specific notice , as they do not hold a _",
    "big star _ , but signifying even a evolutionary step from one research topic to another .",
    "moreover , the latest years of 1995 to 2005 appear continuously without a dominating molecules , which might be the result of an evolving internet with lots of potential in many areas . and especially this vivid and colorful landscape enforces the scientific community to a multitude of research activities , finally shown in publications to different areas . on the other side ,",
    "the amount of human researchers might be grown up , the possibilities of electronically publish a work has been tremendously increased .            a yearly flight over the association landscape between 1970 and 1999 yields on a results as presented in figure [ fig : ximg-40 ] .",
    "the first years are characterized by an alternating appearance of the _ big star _ ( two consecutive years ) and one year of restructuring .",
    "this is , for example , in 1975 , 1978 , and 1981 .",
    "interestingly , the research years where _ artificial intelligence _ had become significantly could be characterized by the social communities between 1982 and 1990 , dominating the publication landscape with less space for other social communities .",
    "in contrast to this , the social communities in the 1990 s not generally concern with one social domain but stay manifold and distributed , sharing more simple _ molecular structures _ than in the years before .",
    "we have focused on entries of the bibliographic communities dblp and characterized communities through a simple typifying description model .",
    "we have set a publication as a transaction between its associated authors , the general idea is to concern with directed associative relationships amongst them , to decompose each pattern to the fundamental _ molecular components _ , and to describe these communities by such _",
    "atomic _ and _ molecular _ attributes .",
    "the decomposition supports the management of discovered structures towards the use of adaptive - incremental mind - maps ( figure [ fig : ximg-44 ] ) , being discovered _ molecular _ structures at the _ associative memory layer _ and firstly managed in the _ short - term _ memory .",
    "understanding bibliographic entries as data stream input , this is an important step towards the interpretation of ( temporal ) _ social communities _ as informational and intermediate results .",
