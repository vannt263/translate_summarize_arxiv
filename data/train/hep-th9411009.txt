    "the solution is especially simple @xmath272 and can in fact easily be checked by direct substitution in ( [ tbaxi ] ) . for the exceptional cases no explicit form of the solutions",

    "@xcite .",
    "another remark to be made is that the identities ( [ adedilog ] ) are in fact consequences of the stronger identities @xcite @xmath273 where we recall that @xmath184 in ( [ ccg ] ) .",
    "[ sec7 ] in this paper we have presented conjectures for polynomial identities of a - d - e type following the ` solvable lattice model ' approach of melzer @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "all polynomials identities can be viewed as finitizations of rogers  ramanujan type identities for branching functions associated with the gko pair @xmath274 at levels @xmath236 , 1 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "apart from extensive computer tests we have corroborated our conjectures by studying the behaviour under level - rank duality for @xmath6=a@xmath2 and by establishing the expected dilogarithm identities following from the a - d - e rogers  ramanujan in the asymptotic limit @xmath7 .",
    "given that we have no proofs of our conjectures a lot of course remains to be done .",
    "first of all it is to be noted that we have only presented fermionic polynomials associated with one particular choice of one - dimensional configuration sum , or , equivalently , we have only given fermionic finitizations of one particular branching function associated with the above mentioned coset pair .",
    "this is in contrast to melzer s original work where fermionic polynomials for all virasoro characters @xmath41 were conjectured .",
    "in fact , the method of proof for the a@xmath28 polynomial identities @xcite relies heavily on the completeness of a set of fermionic polynomials in order to apply recurrence methods similar to those used for obtaining the bosonic polynomials . however , despite some efforts to find fermionic counterparts to all configuration sums @xmath106 we did not succeed to do so in general .",
    "so , for example , for @xmath6=a@xmath2 we only managed to find fermionic forms corresponding to configuration sums of the form @xmath275 with @xmath276 , @xmath277 .",

    "the parameter @xmath279 herein provides the generalization to the cosets @xmath280 and by letting @xmath38 taking any of the values @xmath281 , instead of fixing it as in section  [ sec2 ] , we can obtain fermionic finitizations to several and not just 1 branching function associated with ( [ gkos ] ) .",
