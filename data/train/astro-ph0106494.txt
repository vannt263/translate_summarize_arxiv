    "the observation of extensive air showers ( eas ) provides an opportunity to study the hadronic interaction in an energy range exceeding that of present artificial accelerators , and moreover in kinematical ranges essentially unexplored in collider experiments . the diffractive particle production , which strongly influences the eas development and energy flux in forward direction @xcite , has been experimentally investigated at comparatively low energies ( , for a review see @xcite ) . at higher energies ,",
    "the ua5 experiment could register only and the cdf detector ( ) even only about of the total energy .",
    "additionally one should keep in mind that these experiments examined high - energy proton - antiproton collisions , while nitrogen is the most abundant target nucleus in eas .",
    "hence , hadronic interaction models for the higher energy regime rely on extrapolations from lower energies , guided by more or less detailed theoretical ( qcd inspired ) prescriptions",
    ".    the resulting models of the hadronic interactions suffer from various uncertainties , firstly due to necessary approximations done in the model construction , secondly because of systematic uncertainties and inconsistencies in the experimental results basing the extrapolations .",
    "for example , nucleon - carbon cross - sections have been measured at energies of as @xmath0 and @xcite with uncertainties mainly of systematical character . at the highest energy of ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath1 pev , results obtained for the total proton - antiproton cross - section are @xmath2 ( e710 @xcite ) , ( cdf @xcite ) , and ( e811 @xcite ) with a probability of the values being consistent with each other of only @xcite .",
    "these systematic uncertainties of are propagated when constructing hadron - air and nucleus - air cross - sections for eas simulations .",
    "the effects on the eas predictions are considerable .",
    "as eas simulations using the monte carlo program corsika @xcite show , for proton primaries of an increase of @xmath3(hadron - air ) by , e.g. , leads to a reduction of the number of high - energy hadrons by up to and of the electron number by , calculated for eas of vertical incidence at sea level . the depth of shower maximum gets shifted higher in the atmosphere by about .",
    "the total muon number is relatively little affected ( ) , while the lateral distribution appears to be considerably flatter with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "these model uncertainties also influence astrophysical interpretations of eas measurements .",
    "a salient example is the mass composition at the highest primary energies deduced from the depth of shower maximum .",
    "the composition varies from mixed to pure iron depending on the model ( see , e.g. , reference @xcite ) .",
    "though studies of high - energy hadronic interactions by eas observations imply a limited knowledge about the nature of the interacting primary , the strong dependence of the hadronic eas observables on details of the hadronic interaction models enables a test with effective constraints on the model parameters .",
    "the central detector of the kascade experiment @xcite with a large hadron calorimeter and muon detectors provides unique experimental possibilities for such an endeavour . a recent analysis of the hadronic structure in eas cores at primary energies around the _ knee _ @xcite , i.e.  in the pev region , exhibited differences between the models qgsjet @xcite , venus @xcite , and . in the present article we report on tests at lower primary energies of .",
    "at these energies ,    * the models should be quite reliable due to some overlap with accelerator data and * the primary flux and composition are reasonably well known from balloon and satellite borne experiments , i.e.  with an uncertainty of about at .",
    "the idea is to measure the rate of events in the central detector , when a certain number of trigger counters ( mostly induced by muons ) have fired and at least one hadron has been detected in the calorimeter .",
    "these rates prove to be a stringent test quantity .",
    "they are compared with predictions of eas simulations generated by the models qgsjet , sibyll , venus , @xcite , @xcite , and .",
    "the investigations are performed with the kascade experiment , mainly using its central detector @xcite .",
    "figure  [ kas ] shows a sketch of the experimental arrangement .",
    "an enlarged view of the calorimeter with its iron absorber slabs and eight layers of liquid ionization chambers is shown in the inset .",
    "the third absorber gap houses 456 scintillators ( 0.45 m@xmath4 each ) of the trigger layer . the central detector is surrounded by a scintillator array of field stations registrating the electromagnetic and muonic component of eas .    for triggering the readout of all kascade components , a coincidence of at least nine scintillators of the trigger layer is demanded .",
    "specifically , the signals have to be above 1/3 of that of a minimum ionizing particle .",
    "this trigger multiplicity has been proven to be an appropriate compromise between sensitivity at low primary energies on the one hand and reasonable permanent data amount on the other hand .",
    "given such a trigger , in addition at least one reconstructed hadron with a minimal energy deposit corresponding to is requested in the analysis of the calorimeter . for hadrons of these energies ,",
    "the reconstruction efficiency exceeds .",
    "typically , the trigger is generated by muons with energies , but in case of hadrons , cascading in the calorimeter , these also contribute to the required trigger multiplicity . at low primary energies they even dominate the trigger rate .",
    "the experimental observables investigated in the present studies are two rates , i.e.  the frequency of events which fulfill the described trigger condition , defining the _ trigger rate _ , and the frequency of events with additionally at least one reconstructed hadron , defining the _",
    "hadron rate_.    the measured rates show long - term stability on the percentage level after being corrected for dead - time and air pressure effects ( each correction @xmath510 % ) .",
    "the scintillation counters are monitored permanently utilizing the single muon peak , and the high voltage is corrected if necessary .",
    "the amplification of the ionization chamber signal is checked every six months and proves to be stable within over a period of 4 years .",
    "no electronic cross - talk is observed in the ionization chambers .",
    "uncertainties concerning the trigger layer affect also the hadron rate being a dependent quantity .",
    "it should be emphasized that the knowledge of the absolute energy scale of hadrons , usually extracted from detector simulations and applied in the same way for measurement and simulations , is not necessary since the comparison of both data is performed on the basis of the detector signal , i.e.  choosing the same energy deposit in a reconstructed hadron track .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty of the experimental values , including threshold uncertainties , dead or noisy channels etc .  and taking into account the steep trigger multiplicity and hadron energy spectra , is estimated to for the trigger rate and for the hadron rate as listed in . a detailed discussion of the error budget is given in reference @xcite .",

    "both models indicate that the hadron rate pertains to energies below .",
    "the trigger rate , however , contains significant contributions also from energies above .",
    "a closer inspection shows that the hadron events are mainly caused by proton and @xmath6 to a smaller extent @xmath6 by helium primaries , while for the trigger rate at energies above also heavy primaries become important .",
    "the uncertainties of the simulated rates are listed in table [ tab.errsim ] and will be discussed in the following . the main contribution to",
    "the systematic error stems from the uncertainty in absolute fluxes of the primary particles .",
    "this results in a positive correlation of the systematic uncertainties in both rates . for an error estimation it is favourable to distinguish the primary energy contributions below and above .",
    "approximately , half of the trigger events and most of the hadron events are generated in the low - energy regime . as a guideline ,",
    "the aforementioned uncertainty of at @xcite is adopted .",
    "the trigger rate requires extrapolations to high primary energies . at ,",
    "e.g. , the uncertainty in the absolute flux amounts to about . without changing the absolute flux , even extreme assumptions on the composition or adopting a rigidity dependent _ knee _ influence the trigger rate only little ( @xmath510 % ) because the trigger efficiencies for different primary masses are similar to one another in the pev region .",
    "it should be emphasized that changes of the rates caused by an assumption of a rigidity dependent _ knee _ are included in the uncertainties of total flux and composition quoted in table [ tab.errsim ] .",
    "since the low - energy hadronic interaction model plays an important role for generating low - energy muons @xcite , the corresponding systematic uncertainty of has been estimated by replacing the gheisha code with the program urqmd @xcite .",

    "the integral rates of all models are compiled in figure  [ raten.mod ] together with the experimental kascade value .",

    "the total systematic uncertainty of the predictions as listed in table [ tab.errsim ] is indicated for qgsjet by the dotted line . comparing the calculated results , differences of about a factor 1.7 in the predicted trigger and of 2 in the hadron rate occur .",
    "these discrepancies between the calculations do persist even if , for example , different primary flux parameters were assumed .",
    "all predictions would be shifted in a similar way .",
    "thus , the scatter of the model predictions originates from different realizations of the hadronic interactions in eas .",
    "compared to the measurement , qgsjet , nexus 2 , dpmjet , and predict reasonable values for the trigger rate . on the other hand",
    ", however , all models overestimate the hadron rate considerably . varying the required trigger multiplicity or hadron energy threshold",
    "does not affect this discrepancy significantly .",
    "the ratio of hadron rate to trigger rate of the predictions is twice the experimental value . in this ratio ,",
    "the primary flux uncertainty , e.g. , cancels to a large extent .",
    "is known to produce too small muon multiplicities at observation level for primaries of pev energy @xcite , which will be improved in the currently developed version 2 @xcite .",
    "the reason for the prediction to agree with the measured trigger rate is twofold : firstly , the muon deficiency is less pronounced at lower primary energies which also induce trigger events .",
    "secondly , hadrons also contribute to the trigger rate , and the overestimation of hadron events compensates for the underestimated muon contribution . in accordance with results in reference",
    "@xcite the larger ratio of hadron rate to trigger rate obtained with compared to those of qgsjet and venus indicates a disbalance between the hadronic and muonic component .",
    "the correlation of hadron and trigger rate with respect to model modifications will become apparent in the following and has been checked with a preliminary version of @xcite .",
    "the differences of the simulated rates can be understood in terms of the predicted muon lateral distribution and the number of high - energy hadrons both of which are closely connected to the inelastic cross - section and the elasticity distribution of the high - energy hadronic interactions .",
    "the large cross - sections and low elasticity values in dpmjet , e.g. , entail early developing showers .",
    "consequently , the hadron number at observation level is reduced and the muon lateral distribution is flat with low muon densities in the central part of the shower which contributes most to the trigger rate .",
    "thus , small values for the rates emerge , and vice versa for hdpm .",
    "to obtain an idea how the model parameters have to be changed quantitatively to accomodate simulations to the measurement , several changes in qgsjet have been tried .",
    "qgsjet has been chosen because independent analyses have shown that this model provides the best overall description of eas data @xcite .",
    "it turned out that increasing the inelasticity for non - diffractive hadron - nucleus interactions has minor influence on the calculated hadron rates .",
    "most of the events which contribute to the hadron rate correspond to rare fluctuations of the free - path of the leading hadron with very few interactions , mostly of diffractive - dissociation type , before reaching the ground .",
    "consequently , the calculated hadron rates should decisively depend on the inelastic cross - section and on the probability for the interaction to be diffractive .",
    "therefore , the following ( energy independent ) modifications in qgsjet have been studied in more detail : either the inelastic cross - section was increased or the fraction of diffraction dissociation was lowered keeping the inelastic cross - section constant .",
    "thus , in the latter case the reduction of the diffractive inelastic cross - section is compensated by increasing the non - diffractive inelastic cross - section . theoretically , in the glauber - gribov approach @xcite one has some parameter freedom to adjust the diffraction dissociation cross - section independently of the inelastic cross - section without violating unitarity .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ raten.qgs ] . to start with",
    ", the rates are shown adopting the slightly higher cdf value for the total proton - antiproton cross - section by properly changing the energy - dependent term of the pomeron - nucleon coupling .",
    "the increase from the original in qgsjet to at transforms to an increase of only of the inelastic proton - air cross - section in the energy region which is important for the hadron rate .",
    "more specifically , the cross - section in qgsjet amounts to at and at before / after the modification .",
    "in fact , as can be seen from figure  [ raten.qgs ] , no significant effect on the rates can be stated .",
    "additionally , two values with an inelastic hadron - air cross - section increased arbitrarily by and and three values with diffraction dissociation lowered by , , and of the inelastic cross - section are presented . in the original model , diffraction dissociation accounts for of the inelastic cross - section .",
    "this number comprises all proton - nitrogen collisions with the highest - energetic baryon carrying more than of the initial momentum .",
    "thus , when reducing the diffraction dissociation by of the inelastic cross - section , highly elastic events are suppressed to a large extent .",
    "one observes a large sensitivity of the rates to these changes .",
    "increasing the inelastic cross - section by reduces the hadron rate by about a factor of 2 .",
    "the above - mentioned correlation of hadron and trigger rate due to the model changes can be seen .",
    "additionally , both types of modifications influence the rates in the same way showing that the hadron rate essentially depends on the non - diffractive part of the inelastic cross - section .",
    "the simulations agree best with the measurements if the fraction of diffraction dissociation is reduced by about a factor of 2 or , correspondingly , by of the inelastic cross - section .",
    "the trend of the points in figure  [ raten.qgs ] indicates , however , that the considered changes are not completely sufficient to reconcile the simulations with the measurements .",
    "allowing for energy - dependent modifications could be an option , but , as will be discussed below , also amendments with respect to the predicted hadron multiplicities seem necessary which might influence the calculated integral rates .    to meet the measurement given in figure  [ raten.qgs ] by increasing only @xmath3(p - air ) and leaving the relative diffraction contribution untouched ,",
    "would require values hardly compatible with results obtained at accelerators",
    ". both proton - antiproton cross - sections and the elastic scattering slope are fixed by the collider data at low energies and are already adjusted to maximum values at . using realistic equivalent radii of the nucleon distribution in air nuclei instead of the adopted parametrization in qgsjet might yield a increase of @xmath3(p - air ) @xcite .",
    "however , such an enlargement , still insufficient to achieve the desirable agreement between calculations and kascade measurement , is already extreme because the nucleon electromagnetic form factor in the measured charge distributions has to be accounted for @xcite .",
    "more uncertain than is the fraction of diffractive events , and we conclude that the diffraction dissociation is overestimated in the calculated nucleon - nucleus interactions . in case of qgsjet , diminishing the diffraction dissociation by about of @xmath3(p - air )",
    "seems appropriate , which corresponds to reducing the original contribution by a factor of 2 .",
    "the hadron rate is an observable highly sensitive to the non - diffractive inelastic cross - section .",
    "one should keep in mind the inclusive character of this quantity with contributions of events with very different shower parameters . for most events , generated by primary energies below the reconstruction threshold of the kascade array ( @xmath110.5 pev ) , the usual reconstruction of shower parameters",
    "@xcite is not possible .",
    "however , to determine roughly the contribution of different primary energy intervals to the measured hadron rate , the muon detectors of the array are included in the analysis . depending on the number of fired muon detectors ,",
    "the integral rates are grouped into different bins of 0@xmath61 , 2@xmath63 , 4@xmath610 , and @xmath1210 detectors . a larger number of hit detectors indicates , on average , a higher primary energy .",
    "applying the same binning for measurement and simulation , hadrons from the simulated events are found to originate from primary energies typically below if not more than one muon is registered .",
    "demanding signals in two or three array muon detectors selects showers around , et cetera .    following this scheme ,",
    "the ratios of simulated to measured hadron rates in each interval are given in figure  [ array.raten ] for qgsjet and .",
    "the abscissa displays the corresponding primary energies as extracted from simulations .",
    "similar to the results given in figure  [ eprim_spek ] , average and rms - width of the primary energy distributions do not depend significantly on the interaction model indicating that mainly the frequency of otherwise resembling events is predicted differently .    in both models",
    ", the overestimation of the hadron rate can be attributed to low primary energies . in this area , the hadrons predicted by the calculations are in most cases the highest - energetic ones in the shower , having suffered only a few and predominantly diffractive collisions .",
    "few interactions with minor energy loss are plausible , because for normal shower developments the small energy gap from the primary particle to the calorimeter threshold of would be too limiting .    to support this qualitative statement in a more quantitative way , additional information available in simulations",
    "is utilized . in corsika , for each hadron at observation level its generation @xmath13 of the producing interaction within the cascade is recorded .",
    "for the most energetic shower hadron , an average hadron energy of @xmath14 is expected with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the energy and mass of the primary particle and 0.38 the mean elasticity in qgsjet , i.e. , the energy fraction of the most energetic baryon to the initial energy in proton - air collisions .",
    "the mean elasticity is to a good approximation energy independent in the range of interest .    in figure  [ quot.lead ]",
    "the ratio of this calculated energy to the actual energy is plotted for the hadron with the highest reconstructed energy , using the qgsjet model .",
    "we observe ratios smaller than 1 at low primary energies indicating that the hadrons originate from highly elastic interactions .",
    "in addition , for primaries below the detected hadrons are predominantly nucleons , the typical leading particles in proton - air collisions .",
    "therefore , as long as this type of events dominates the predicted hadron rate one is to a large extent restricted to increase the non - diffractive part of @xmath3(p - air ) in order to reduce significantly the calculated value .",
    "apart from the leading particle , details of the secondary particle production are of minor importance in this case .    this prevalence of diffractive dissociation and of the leading particle decreases with rising primary energy .",
    "secondary hadrons in the shower start to contribute to the hadron rate .",
    "the ratio increases to values well above 1 , and pions , as the typical secondary particles , become more numerous .",
    "thus , at higher primary energies the hadron events can be used to test also particle production , being in particular sensitive to the spectra of pions and kaons in the forward region .    for such tests",
    "an appropriate quantity could be the mean multiplicity of hadrons in the calorimeter , as shown in figure  [ array.hmulti ] .",
    "the hadron events are grouped into intervals according to the number of muons observed by the array , in a similar way as in figure  [ array.raten ] .",
    "the intervals with more than one muon are combined to achieve a more significant result when averaging discrete multiplicity values with limited statistics .",
    "the gross trend , however , is apparent .",
    "one observes a discrepancy between experiment and model predictions at both intervals shown , especially for qgsjet . at low primary energies the measurement yields on average more than one hadron ,",
    "whereas in simulations in most cases only one hadron arrives at the detector . at higher energies the prediction of the newly developed code nexus 2 agrees better with the measured hadron multiplicity .    in simulation",
    "it is checked that the multiplicity of hadrons reaching the detector is reconstructed correctly . in case of multiple hadrons ,",
    "both in the measurement and the calculations the typical separation of hadrons is much larger than the spatial detector resolution .",
    "the mean hadron multiplicity turns out to be quite insensitive to modifications of the cross - sections as given in figure  [ raten.qgs ] and thus allows to test additional features of the hadronic interaction models . to improve the agreement harder spectra of secondary pions and kaons appear to be required .",
    "future investigations , especially including the energy - multiplicity correlation of hadrons , have to throw light onto this issue .",
    "the kascade detector system measures observables which allow to test high - energy hadronic interaction models as implemented in the corsika code .",
    "the measured hadron rates are most sensitive to primary energies between 0.5 and . in this region",
    "the primary fluxes are reasonably well known and the models are expected to be quite reliable .",
    "the investigations reveal distinct differences in the rates between the models which can be related to the inelastic cross - section and the contribution of diffractive dissociation .",
    "so far none of the models can explain the measurements correctly .",
    "we attribute the overestimation of the hadron rate at small primary energies to an underestimate of the non - diffractive inelastic cross - section for nucleon - air collisions . to reconcile simulations with measurements",
    "while keeping the inelastic cross - section unchanged , the contribution of diffraction dissociation should be reduced , e.g.  for qgsjet by about of the inelastic cross - section .",
    "this corresponds to about half of the original contribution .",
    "it would therefore be highly desirable to measure the proton inelastic cross - section on nitrogen and oxygen at the highest energies at accelerators and to study the kinematical region of diffraction dissociation .",
    "particle production in the forward region can be checked at kascade via hadron multiplicities .",
    "first analyses point towards harder spectra of secondary pions and kaons .",
    "further studies with the new models and in close connection to the authors of the models are under way and will , hopefully , help to improve our understanding of the hadronic interaction processes in air showers .",
    "we are very grateful to r.  engel and k.  werner for illuminating discussions and appreciate their advice when applying their models , and to g.b .",
    "yodh for carefully reading the manuscript .",

    "<S> an analysis of muon and hadron rates observed in the central detector of the kascade experiment has been carried out . </S>",
    "<S> the data are compared to corsika simulations employing the high - energy hadronic interaction models qgsjet , dpmjet , hdpm , sibyll , and venus . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , first results with the new hadronic interaction model are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> differences of the model predictions , both among each other and when confronted with measurements , are observed . </S>",
    "<S> the hadron rates mainly depend on the inelastic cross - section and on the contribution of diffraction dissociation . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy between simulations and measurements at low primary energies around 5 tev can be reduced by increasing the non - diffractive part of the inelastic cross - section of nucleon - air interactions . </S>",
    "<S> examination of hadron multiplicities points towards harder spectra of secondary pions and kaons needed in the calculations .    </S>",
