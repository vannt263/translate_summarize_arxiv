    "radio source 3c84 is associated with the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in ngc1275 , the central galaxy in the perseus cluster , the prototypical ` cooling flow ' cluster @xcite . the black hole in the agn launches powerful jets into the surrounding medium .",
    "the accretion process onto the black hole has been studied through a variety of techniques on scales as small as a few parsecs @xcite . at the distance of ngc1275 , 1 pc",
    "subtends 3 milliarcseconds .    at cm wavelengths 3c84 is well - known as an ` unpolarized ' calibrator",
    "why is this so , given that the radio emission from the agn and its associated jet arise from synchrotron emission , which should be highly polarized ?",
    "one possibility is that faraday rotation twists the position angle @xmath2 of this linearly polarized radiation as it propagates through foreground plasma .",
    "the position angle is rotated by @xmath3 , where rm is the rotation measure .",
    "if rm varies across the source and the observations do not resolve this structure ( `` beam depolarization '' ) , the net observed polarization may be very small .    measurements of faraday rotation along the line of sight to the black hole provide a valuable diagnostic of the accretion flow onto the central object , since the rm is proportional to the integral of the electron density and the magnetic field along the line of sight . in the case of sgra",
    "* , for example , the rm has been used to constrain both the mode and the rate of the accretion onto its black hole @xcite .",
    "similar methods have recently been applied to m87 @xcite .",
    "time variability of the rm could also be a valuable probe of turbulence in the accretion region @xcite .    for 3c84 , @xcite found an rm of about 7000  toward a small spot in the jet about 15 milliarcseconds ( @xmath4  pc ) south of the nucleus , based on vlba maps at wavelengths of 1.3 , 2.0 , and 3.6  cm .",
    "it was not possible to fit the rm toward the nucleus itself because in that direction linear polarization was detected only at a single wavelength ( and only at the 0.2% level ) . at 7 mm , where emission from the nucleus becomes dominant",
    ", vlba monitoring observations by the boston university group @xcite sometimes detect spots of weak linear polarization toward the nucleus , but typically the polarized flux density is @xmath5% of the peak flux density .    polarization should be easier to detect at mm wavelengths because faraday rotation decreases steeply at shorter wavelengths , and because the mm emission region is smaller , so that variations in rm across the source are less problematic .",
    "however , based on observations made with the plateau de bure interferometer in 2011 mar , @xcite placed upper limits of 0.5% on the linear polarization of 3c84 at wavelengths of 1.3 and 0.9 mm .",
    "here we report observations at the same wavelengths made over a 2 year period with the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy ( carma ) and with the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "the fractional polarization of 3c84 was @xmath6 in the earliest data , from 2011 may , consistent with the @xcite results , but by late 2011 it had increased to the 12% level .",
    "the rm inferred from the data is @xmath7  , among the largest ever measured .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results for the accretion flow onto the black hole in 3c84 .",
    "the carma polarization system @xcite consists of dual - polarization 1.3 mm receivers that are sensitive to right- ( r ) and left - circular ( l ) polarization , and a spectral - line correlator that measures all four cross - correlations ( rr , ll , lr , rl ) on each of the 105 baselines connecting the 15 antennas .",
    "the double sideband receivers are sensitive to signals at sky frequencies @xmath8 above ( upper sideband ) and below ( lower sideband ) the local oscillator frequency @xmath9 .",
    "signals received in these two sidebands are separated in cross - correlation spectra .",
    "the correlator provides 4 independently tunable sections , each up to 500  mhz wide .",
    "typically we centered these sections at intermediate frequencies @xmath10 of 68 ghz , so that the polarization data from the upper and lower sidebands spanned a sky frequency range of 16  ghz .",
    "data were analyzed with the miriad package @xcite .",
    "stokes parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 were derived for each of the 8 spectral windows ( 4 sections @xmath14 2 sidebands ) . @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 may be considered components of a complex polarization vector @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the linearly polarized flux density in jy , @xmath17 is the electric vector position angle , rm is the rotation measure , @xmath18 is the redshift , and @xmath19 is the position angle at the reference frequency @xmath20 ( 225  ghz ) .",
    "the factor @xmath21 arises because faraday rotation takes place at frequency @xmath22 in the source frame ; this correction factor is negligible for 3c84 , at @xmath23 .",
    "we fit @xmath24 and @xmath25 to solve for @xmath16 , @xmath19 , and rm .    for a bright but weakly polarized source like 3c84 ,",
    "the accuracy of the measurements is limited by systematic errors , not thermal noise .",
    "the primary difficulty is in correcting for the polarization leakages  the cross coupling between the l and r channels caused by imperfections in the receivers or crosstalk in the if system .",
    "leakages are derived from observations of a bright point source , polarized or unpolarized ( usually 3c84 itself ) , obtained over a wide range of parallactic angle .",
    "miriad task gpcal fits these data to solve simultaneously for the source polarization , receiver gains , and leakage corrections . since the carma receivers have no moving parts the leakages are stable over periods of months .",
    "their magnitudes are typically of order 6% , however , and they have considerable frequency structure .",
    "we calibrated the leakages separately for each of the 8 spectral windows .",
    "we were able to set only a crude upper limit of on the magnitude of circular polarization ( stokes @xmath26 ) because this requires highly accurate calibration of the gains of the r and l channels on a source other than 3c84 .",
    "sma observations were conducted in both the 1.3 mm and 0.9 mm bands .",
    "the single polarization receivers are switched between r and l circular polarization by inserting quarter wave plates into the optical path . using a different switching pattern for each of the 8 telescopes , all 4 cross - polarizations ( rr , ll",
    ", lr , rl ) are measured every 5 minutes on each baseline . like carma",
    ", the sma operates in double sideband mode , with a 48 ghz if .",
    "the available observational bandwidths were either 2 ghz or 4 ghz .",
    "thus the data spanned a sky frequency range of either 10  ghz or 12  ghz .",
    "data were reduced using a combination of the mir / idl and miriad data reduction packages .",
    "the instrumental polarization is frequency - dependent and the typical values are @xmath27 .",
    "the instrumental polarization is determined with an accuracy of @xmath28 .",
    "the rm was fit to the difference in the upper and lower sideband position angles .",
    "of 232.5  ghz overlap those observed at 218 and 247  ghz .",
    "the error bars are estimated from the scatter in the measurements at each frequency and do not fully reflect systematic errors in the polarization leakage calibration .",
    "fractional polarizations of 1.5% were measured for both 3c84 and 0359 + 509 ; 0359 + 509 has a much lower flux density than 3c84 , so the position angle uncertainties due to thermal noise are larger .",
    "rotation measures are derived from fits to the position angle vs. frequency , indicated by the blue curves . ]",
    "the 3c84 data reported here span the period from 2011 may through 2013 august . in almost all cases 3c84 was observed as a calibrator for another science target .",
    "many of the carma datasets were from the tadpol survey @xcite .",
    "one carma observation targeted 3c84 specifically . in an 8-hour observation on 2013 august 04 we interleaved observations at lo frequencies of 218 , 232.5 , and 247  ghz to obtain wide parallactic angle coverage at 16 sky frequencies from 210255  ghz .",

    "the polarization position angle trended monotonically toward more negative values , apparently wrapping through from @xmath84 to @xmath85 twice over the 2 year span of the observations .",
    "also plotted in figure  [ fig : bigplot ] are the r - band optical polarizations and position angles for 3c84 measured with the 1.8-m perkins telescope at lowell observatory ( flagstaff , az ) using the prism camera .",
    "the observations and data reduction were performed in the same manner as described by @xcite for the quasar 3c454.3 . the 12% fractional polarization in",
    "the optical is similar to that at mm wavelengths , but there is not a simple correspondence between the optical and mm position angles ; @xmath86 sometimes fluctuates by tens of degrees on time scales of days , while @xmath87 tends to vary more smoothly .",
    "generally there is good agreement between the carma and sma results at 1.3 mm ; significant rm measurements were made with both instruments .",
    "it was not possible to detect faraday rotation from the 0.9 mm data alone  at this wavelength the expected position angle difference between the upper and lower sidebands is only 2.5@xmath29 for an rm of @xmath88  .",
    "however , interpolation of the data in figure  [ fig : bigplot ] shows that position angles at 0.9 mm were 3040@xmath29 more negative than those at 1.3 mm in mid-2012 .",
    "the fact that this offset is maintained over a period of months even as the position angles at both wavelengths rotate through 90 degrees provides powerful evidence that we are observing faraday rotation in an external screen , rather than variations in the polarization direction vs. synchrotron optical depth .",
    "a 35@xmath89 difference in the 1.3 mm and 0.9 mm position angles corresponds to an rm of ( @xmath90)@xmath1  .",
    "the uncertainties in the rm measurements listed in table  1 do not fully account for possible systematic errors in the polarization leakage corrections .",
    "thus , although our results allow for possibility of up to 50% variations in the rm on time scales of days or weeks , the evidence for such variations is not convincing .",
    "an average of the 1.3 mm rm values , excluding the anomalous result from 2011 may , gives , where the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the measurements .",
    "where do the linearly polarized emission and faraday rotation originate in 3c84 , and what conclusions can we draw about the source ?      we expect that at wavelengths of @xmath91 mm most of the flux originates from a small region , probably less than a milliarcsecond ( @xmath92  pc ) across , centered close to the nucleus . for an agn with radio jets the mm emission `` core ''",
    "is thought to be located somewhere in the approaching jet , displaced from the black hole .    in blazars , where the jet is closely aligned with our line of sight",
    ", the core may be offset by thousands of schwarzschild radii ( @xmath93 ) from the black hole , near the end of the zone where the jet is electromagnetically accelerated , because this is where doppler boosting is greatest . for jets that are viewed at a substantial angle",
    ", however , this model predicts that the core should be close to the base of the jet @xcite . in m87 , for example , where the jet is inclined by @xmath9420@xmath29 with respect to the line of sight , vlba observations by @xcite show that the 7 mm radio core is offset by only 1423 @xmath93 from the black hole , while 1.3 mm vlbi observations appear to resolve the base of the jet , just 2.54  @xmath93 from the black hole @xcite .",
    "the jets in 3c84 are mildly relativistic and are directed at an angle of roughly @xmath95 to @xmath96 to the line of sight @xcite , so here too the offset of the core from the black hole may be small .",
    "variations in the polarization position angle presumably are caused by changes in the magnetic field structure of the emitting region , possibly as the result of shocks propagating along the jet similar to what is seen in blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "optical emission originates in these same shocks , although from volumes that are much smaller , leading to faster fluctuations in the optical position angles @xcite .",
    "the rotation of 3c84 s optical and mm polarization position angles with time is reminiscent of the systematic variations seen in bllac in late 2005 . in bllac , this rotation was correlated with an optical , x - ray , and radio outburst , and was attributed to a shock propagating along a helical magnetic field in the jet @xcite .",
    "where , then , is the faraday screen ? is it close to the nucleus , or far away in the intracluster gas ?",
    "the rotation measure is given by @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the thermal electron density in @xmath99 , @xmath100 is the magnetic field in gauss , and @xmath101 is the path length along the direction of propagation in pc .",
    "only the component of the magnetic field along the line of sight contributes ; if the field is tangled , with many reversals along the line of sight , the rm will be reduced .",
    "it is implausible that the faraday rotation originates in the intracluster gas .",
    "typical rms toward cooling flow clusters are in the range @xmath102 to @xmath103  @xcite , similar to the rm of 7000  measured by @xcite 15 mas ( 5 pc ) from 3c84 s nucleus",
    ". the rm could be higher if we happen to view the nucleus along the axis of one of the partially ionized filaments that thread the intracluster gas surrounding ngc1275 @xcite .",
    "these filaments , in diameter and several kpc long , are stabilized by 10@xmath104 gauss magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "if our line of sight to the nucleus passed precisely along the axis of such a filament it could account for the measured rm , but such perfect alignment is improbable .    probably the faraday screen is close to the nucleus , within a parsec of the emission core",
    ". we can not be certain whether the material in this screen is being blown out from the black hole or is accreting onto it .",
    "we consider these two possibilities below .",
    "faraday rotation might originate in the sheath or boundary layer of the radio jet , in plasma that is flowing outward from the black hole .",
    "@xcite suggested such a geometry to explain the faraday rotation measured in a sample of 40 radio galaxies and quasars observed with the vlba at wavelengths of 2  cm to 3.6  cm .",
    "rotation measures were typically @xmath102 to @xmath103  for the radio cores in these sources .",
    "this is comparable to the rm of about 7000  measured in the 3c84 jet 5  pc from the nucleus by @xcite at wavelengths of 1.3 to 3.6 cm .",
    "the much higher rm that we measure at 1.3 mm might be explained if the mm emission originates closer to the base of the jet and thus propagates through a denser zone of the boundary layer .",
    "in fact , an increase of rm at shorter wavelengths appears to be common in radio jets . in an agn polarization survey",
    ", @xcite found that the rm measured at mm wavelengths was greater than the rm measured at cm wavelengths in 8 of 8 sources ; a fit to these data gave @xmath105 , with @xmath106 .",
    "this dependence can be explained by a simple model in which the @xmath107 surface is located at distance @xmath108 along the jet , and where the magnetic field , path length , and electron density in the boundary layer scale as @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 respectively , giving @xmath112 @xcite .    for 3c84 ,",
    "scaling the 1.3 cm rm of 7000  by @xmath113 gives rm @xmath114  at 1.3 mm , in good agreement with the measured value .",
    "we caution that this agreement may be a fortuitous coincidence .",
    "the model assumes that the cm emission originates 10 times farther from the nucleus than does the mm emission .",
    "in fact , however , the mm emission likely originates within a few @xmath14 0.1  mas of the nucleus , whereas the cm rm was measured at the tip of the jet 15 mas away , so the actual distance ratio is closer to 100 .",
    "we now consider the possibility that the faraday rotation originates in the accretion flow onto the black hole .",
    "the rm , @xmath7  , is among the largest ever detected .",
    "however , it is striking for the fact that it is not larger .",
    "it is less than a factor of two greater than the rm observed toward sgra * , which is thought to originate in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) surrounding the black hole @xcite .",
    "for sgra * the rm constrains the accretion rate onto the black hole to be @xmath115 ; bondi accretion is excluded because it requires an even higher rm .",
    "accretion onto the black hole in 3c84 , on the other hand , powers a massive outflow into the perseus cluster . in 3c84",
    "the black hole mass is @xmath116 @xcite , 2.5 orders of magnitude larger than sgra * , and the total luminosity is @xmath117 @xcite , 9 orders of magnitude larger .",
    "if the rm scales with the black hole mass or mass accretion rate , we might expect it to be orders of magnitude larger in 3c84 .",
    "accretion flow models fall into two classes .",
    "riaf models should be applicable to sources with luminosities less than about 1% of the eddington luminosity @xcite ; thin disk models @xcite are more appropriate for higher luminosity sources .",
    "3c84 s luminosity is about 0.4% of its eddington luminosity of @xmath118  ergs  s@xmath119 , so it is reasonable to use riaf models to predict its rm .    following the formulation for the rm as a function of accretion rate for spherical power - law accretion profiles in @xcite should be @xmath120 @xcite . ]",
    ", we calculated the rm for riaf models with inner radii @xmath121 of 3 and 300 schwarzschild radii @xmath93 ( figure  [ fig : rm ] ) .",
    "@xmath122 pc for an @xmath116 black hole ; @xmath121 is the radius at which the accretion flow becomes relativistic , or is truncated for some other reason .",
    "we assume a very large outer radius , @xmath123 , about 8  pc .",
    "the results are not sensitive to @xmath124 or to the density power - law index , @xmath125 , which selects between the limiting cases of advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; @xmath126 ) and convection - dominated accretion flow ( cdaf ; @xmath127 ) models .",
    "for @xmath128 the measured rm implies an accretion rate @xmath129 .",
    "this value is strongly inconsistent with the accretion rate @xmath130 estimated from the bolometric luminosity and a radiative efficiency of 10% ; an even higher accretion rate is required if the radiative efficiency is lower .",
    "we can account for the rm in an adaf context only if @xmath131  pc .",
    "even larger values are required for cdaf models .",
    "but these inner radii are much larger than any theoretical expectations .",
    "if the polarized radiation at 1.3 mm originates close to the black hole , then either the magnetic field in the accretion flow is much weaker than the equipartition value assumed in the calculation , or the field is highly tangled , or the accretion flow is disk - like rather than spherical .",
    "other observations suggest that material close to the nucleus of ngc1275 lies in a disk that is tilted with respect to the line of sight .",
    "for example , @xcite model nir observations of ionized species in the inner @xmath132 ( 50 pc ) region as originating from a disk at an inclination angle of 45@xmath29 , with electron density @xmath133 and temperature @xmath134  k.    this disk is detectable on even smaller scales via radio free - free absorption in multifrequency vlba images @xcite .",
    "absorption is seen against the n counterjet , but not toward the nucleus or the s jet .",
    "modeling suggests that it originates in a torus with @xmath135 , @xmath136  k , and @xmath137  pc @xcite .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field in this gas is @xmath138  mg .",
    "if the polarized mm emission passed through 3  pc of this material , the rm could be as large as @xmath139  , 20 times the measured value .",
    "probably line of sight to the mm core intercepts only a small fraction of this material . since we do not know the exact location of the mm emission region relative to the black hole , it is difficult to constrain the scale height of the disk .",
    "the absence of measurable free - free absorption toward the nucleus at 1.3 cm can be explained if the cm wavelength emission originates farther downstream in the jet due to optical depth effects , as in the model described in section  [ section : sheath ] above .    the jet efficiency , @xmath140 , defined as the ratio of the jet power @xmath141 to the accretion power @xmath142 onto the black hole , has been used to explore the mechanisms through which jets are launched , as well as the role of black hole spin and magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath141 may be inferred from the energetics of x - ray cavities excavated by the jets .",
    "if one assumes that accretion onto the black hole occurs at the bondi rate , then it is typical to infer jet efficiencies of a few percent @xcite .",
    "bondi accretion is spherically symmetric inflow from the accretion radius @xmath143 , where the sound speed @xmath144 is estimated from x - ray observations of the gas temperature near the center of the galaxy . for 3c84 , as in most radio galaxies , this temperature is in the range 0.53  kev @xcite , so the accretion radius is tens of parsecs .",
    "our rm results and the free - free absorption data suggest , however , that accretion is disk - like on scales smaller than @xmath145 , which implies that estimates of @xmath146 based on spherical bondi or riaf models may not be valid for all sources , especially those near the transition between riaf and thin - disk accretion .      on timescales of decades",
    "the emission from 3c84 varies dramatically , both in the radio and in the @xmath147-ray band ; currently the source is brightening rapidly @xcite , suggesting increased fueling of the black hole .",

    "span our polarization measurements show no apparent systematic increase in the rm .",
    "this suggests that processes inside r@xmath148 control accretion onto the black hole , or that our line of sight to the mm core does not pass through the inner accretion flow .",
    "more precise measurements of the rm would be valuable to search for variability caused by turbulence or patchiness in the accretion flow , as in the sgra * models of @xcite . or",
    ", if the polarized mm emission originates in a hot spot moving outward along the radio jet , then changes in the rm could be used to probe the structure of the accretion flow as a function of radius .",
    "polarization observations with carma and the sma show that radio source 3c84 is linearly polarized at wavelengths of 1.3 mm and 0.9 mm .",
    "the variation in position angle with wavelength is consistent with faraday rotation , with a rotation measure of ( @xmath0)@xmath149  , among the largest ever measured .",
    "the fractional polarization was 12% over most of the 2 years spanned by these observations .",
    "the rotation measure was stable within @xmath15050% over this period , even as the polarization position angle drifted steadily toward more negative values , wrapping through a span of roughly 300 degrees .",
    "we argue that at mm wavelengths the linearly polarized radiation from 3c84 originates from the nucleus of the system , possibly within tens of schwarzschild radii of the black hole , and that the faraday screen lies just in front of the emission region .",
    "it is uncertain whether the faraday rotation originates in in the boundary layer of the radio jet , or in the accretion flow onto the black hole .",
    "we investigated whether quasi - spherical radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) models could explain the measured rm but found that they overpredicted it by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that on scales of less than a parsec the accretion flow onto the black hole is primarily disk - like rather than spheroidal .",
    "the geometry of the disk previously inferred from free - free absorption appears to be correct , with the disk obscuring the counterjet and the innermost parts of the core .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of faraday rotation toward radio source 3c84 , the active galactic nucleus in ngc1275 at the core of the perseus cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation measure ( rm ) , determined from polarization observations at wavelengths of 1.3 and 0.9 mm , is ( @xmath0)@xmath1 , among the largest ever measured . </S>",
    "<S> the rm remained relatively constant over a 2 year period even as the intrinsic polarization position angle wrapped through a span of 300 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> the faraday rotation is likely to originate either in the boundary layer of the radio jet from the nucleus , or in the accretion flow onto the central black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion flow probably is disk - like rather than spherical on scales of less than a parsec , otherwise the rm would be even larger . </S>"
