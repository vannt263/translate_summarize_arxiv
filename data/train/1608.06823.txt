    "each type of model has its own advantages and disadvantages .    in discrete particle models ,",
    "the internal structure of materials is directly simulated through its geometric approximation and accounts for the actual intrinsic randomness specific of the selected length scale .",
    "particles replicate the effect of major heterogeneities and their interaction is formulated by contact algorithms or through inter - particle lattice struts whose constitutive behavior models specific physical mechanisms . as such",
    ", discrete models have the advantage that many microscopic effects can be accounted for in a straightforward manner .",
    "however , they often lead to large computational systems , especially to simulate real structures , and require a significant , often overwhelming , amount of computational resources .    continuum models are computationally less expensive . but",
    "most of the continuum models are based on the cauchy continuum which can not take into account features of the internal structure and does not possess a characteristic length .",
    "these type of models have some well - known drawbacks .",
    "first of all , they are not able to produce a mathematically well - posed problem in the softening regime causing strong mesh sensitivity in the numerical results @xcite .",
    "secondly , the dispersive nature of wave propagation , typical of many heterogeneous materials , can not be reproduced .",
    "furthermore conventional continuum formulations predict unrealistic stress singularities at the tip of sharp cracks and fail to simulate size effect phenomena correctly @xcite .    in order to overcome these drawbacks ,",
    "non - local continuum theories have been proposed in the literature .",
    "a popular approach consists in enriching continua with high order strain and stresses .",
    "cosserat brothers study @xcite was one of the initial attempt in this direction .",
    "they considered independent rotational degrees of freedom , modeling smaller scale kinematics , in addition to translational degrees of freedom .",
    "later , the couple - stress theory was developed by toupin @xcite . in this model",
    "the only independent field is the displacement field that also determines the rotations .",
    "eringen developed the so - called micropolar continuum theory @xcite and non - local elasticity @xcite .",

    "mindlin @xcite proposed an enhanced elastic theory with microstructural effects by considering the potential energy density as a quadratic form of gradient of strain in addition to quadratic form of strains .",

    "they investigated the possibility of formulating high - order constitutive equations with and without high order stresses .",
    "they found that , contrarily to the model with high - order stresses , the one without is unstable .",

    "they considered a representative volume of material as a collection of grains interacting through inter - granular force displacement relations .",
    "inter - granular force displacement relations are formulated based on atomistic - level particle interactions .",
    "these force displacement relationships are then used to derive the incremental stress - strain relationship of a representative volume of material .",

    "al @xcite applied this type of microstructural granular based higher - order continuum theory to model the failure behavior of nanophased ceramics .",
    "they compared results obtained from the ab initio simulations with the result of higher - order continuum theory with good agreement .",
    "nonlinear nonlocal constitutive equations were also proposed without enrichment of the elastic part and by using integral or gradient approaches to enrich plasticity and damage theories .",
    "integral type models are based replacing a local variable with its weighted spatial averaging over a certain volume of material .",
    "pijaudier - cabot and baant @xcite pioneered research in this area . on the contrary ,",
    "gradient plasticity or gradient damage models are based on enriching state variables with high - order terms .",
    "a phenomenological strain gradient plasticity theory was developed by fleck and hutchinson @xcite in the context of couple - stress theory where only rotational part of strain gradients is taken into account .",
    "they extended the classical j2 plasticity to account for strain gradient effects .",
    "later they reformulated their model and included also stretch gradients in addition to rotational ones @xcite .",
    "they investigated their model performance by applying it to the simulation of size effect on torsion of wires , sheet bending , indentation and void growth .",
    "later , the so - called mechanism based theory of strain gradient plasticity ( msg ) @xcite was proposed on the basis of a multiscale framework linking statistically stored and geometrically necessary dislocations to plastic strains and strain gradient .",
    "a reformulation of mechanism - based strain gradient plasticity was given by @xcite that involves the third - order tensor of higher - order stress to a much simpler version within fleck and hutchinson s theoretical framework of strain gradient plasticity theory .",

    "these types of elements can be non - conforming and are required to fulfill the patch test @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ru and aifantis @xcite developed a strategy based on operator split method for their simplified strain gradient model , in which the fourth - order partial differential equations of gradient elasticity are split into two separate second - order partial differential equations and they implement it using @xmath1 finite element .",
    "classical microplane model formulations , pionered by baant and coworkers @xcite , assume that nonlinear phenomena such as , but not limited to , fracture , shearing , and plastic deformations occur on specific orientations within the internal structure of the material . therefore , microplane models simulate these phenomena through vectorial constitutive laws formulated on the so called `` microplanes '' representing generic orientations in space .",
    "the strain vector on a generic microplane is obtained by projecting the strain tensor onto a local system of reference and the stress tensor is computed from tractions on all possible orientations in space through an energetic equivalence .",
    "the initial formulations of microplane models focused on concrete materials and the most recent one , labeled as m7 @xcite , has demonstrated a remarkable ability to reproduce typical experimental data relevant to a large variety of loading conditions , from tension to confined compression ; from quasi - static to highly dynamic conditions .",
    "microplane models have also been successfully developed for other materials such as rock @xcite ; rigid foam and shape memory alloys @xcite ; fiber reinforced concrete @xcite ; as well as composite laminates @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned microplane formulations are `` local '' in the sense that the stress tensor at a given point is only function of the strain tensor at the same point .",
    "unfortunately , such constitutive equations suffer from mesh sensitivity and spurious energy dissipation @xcite when softening behavior is simulated . to overcome this problem ,",
    "nonlocal microplane models were proposed by various authors @xcite by exploiting integral methods , in which the nonlinear behavior at one point depends on a weighted average of the strain in the neighborhood of that point . these approaches",
    "while preventing mesh sensitivity quite effectively lead to a significant increase of the computational cost of simulations .",
    "an alternative to integral microplane models is to adopt strain - gradient formulations such as the ones proposed by kuhl et al .",
    "@xcite and , more recently , by cusatis and zhou @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "starting from a discrete particle model , they derived a high order microplane ( hom ) theory which includes cosserat theory and strain gradients elasticity as a special cases .",
    "the hom model possess two characteristic lengths : the first associated with the spacing of flaws in the material internal structure and related to the gradient character of the continuum ; and the second associated with the size of these flaws and related to the micro - polar character of the continuum .",
    "following cusatis and zhou @xcite , one can calculate microplane strains and curvatures as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the strain tensor , @xmath4 is the curvature tensor ; @xmath5 is the strain gradient tensor also referred to as high order strain tensor ; @xmath6 , @xmath7 are displacement and rotation , respectively , at a generic position @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in a 3d continuum .",

    "the microplane stress integration is performed by a voronoi integration scheme ( see appendix a ) with 66 microplane over the entire unit sphere . in order to control the location of the the localization zone , the central one tenth of the bar is weakened by reducing the tensile strength by 10 % .    for comparison , simulations with @xmath111",
    "are also performed .",
    "as one might expect , for @xmath111 the bar response is mesh dependent .",
    "the load displacement curve is increasingly more brittle ( fig .",

    "[ reg_uniaxial_bar]f does not show the extreme strain localization of the local simulation but still there is not a clear convergence upon mesh refinement .",
    "cusatis and zhou @xcite conducted a 1d spectral analysis of localization and proposed to regularize the solution by computing the high order stresses as @xmath226 where @xmath227 and @xmath228 is the localization limiter .",
    "for the 1d case and for linear softening , one can obtain a localization band equal to @xmath229 if @xmath230 @xcite . for exponential softening ,",
    "in which the softening modulus is not constant , the localization limiter must be a function of the current value of strain .",
    "in this case , and again with reference to a 1d setting , one can write @xmath231 with @xmath232 . in order to use this 1d result in the microplane formulation",
    "one can write @xmath233 where @xmath234 accounts for the presence of shear on the microplanes ( see the adopted constitutive equations above ) .    from the physical point of view , this regularization strategy corresponds to adding , in parallel with the softening microplane stresses , additional non - softening microplane stresses which ensure that the phase velocity of a propagating uniaxial wave is always real .",
    "it is worth noting that such parallel coupling of softening and elastic components is also intrinsically captured by the microplane model by virtue of the kinematic constraint ( eq . [ eq : def_microplane_strain ] ) and the micro - macro stress relation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : stress_integration_sphere ] ) .",
    "this is the reason why partial regularization is attained with @xmath235 and @xmath236 ( figs .",
    "[ reg_uniaxial_bar]b and [ reg_uniaxial_bar]f )    figs .",
    "[ reg_uniaxial_bar]c and  [ reg_uniaxial_bar]g show the obtained response by adopting the formulation in eqs .",
    "[ eq : reqhigherorderstress ] and [ eq : localization - parameter ] .",
    "as one can see , the initial softening branch is very well regularized .",
    "however , the rest of the softening curve shows an oscillatory behavior , the convergence upon mesh refinement is not clear , and a residual load appear even for relatively large strains ( stress locking ) .",
    "the strain profile does not localize in one element but , again , clear convergence can not be demonstrated .",
    "the stress locking phenomenon is due to the fact that the additional elastic stresses associated with @xmath237 are added during the entire simulation , since the beginning when the material has yet to soften .",
    "this is clearly unnecessary .",
    "an alternative regularization scheme which avoids this shortcoming can be formulated by introducing the regularization term on the stress increments as opposed to total stress . in this case",
    "[ eq : reqhigherorderstress ] is substituted by the following equations    @xmath238    where @xmath239 for @xmath240 and eq .",
    "[ eq : localization - parameter ] holds for @xmath241 .    figs .",
    "[ reg_uniaxial_bar]d and [ reg_uniaxial_bar]h shows the results obtained with this incremental formulation . as one can see , both the load displacement curve and the strain profile along the bar are fully regularized and both show a clear convergence upon mesh refinement .",
    "the localization band is larger than the theoretical 1d value of @xmath242 .",
    "this is due to the intrinsic 3d formulation of the microplane model which , even under uniaxial tensile macroscopic conditions , feature tensile and shear strains and stresses at each microplane orientation .",
    "the correct estimate of the localization band requires a fully 3d spectral analysis , which , however is intractable from the analytical point of view ( see discussion in ref .",
    "this paper presents the isogeometric finite element implementation of a recently developed high - order microplane ( hom ) model .",
    "the hom model was originally derived based on a discrete particle model and the resulting theory includes gradient elasticity and cosserat theory as a special cases .",
    "in addition , the hom model allows for an effective regularization of softening constitutive equations by means a simple modification of the high order stresses .",
    "the numerical simulations are carried out with an isogometric finite element characterized by 27 control points and 6 degrees of freedom , 3 displacement components and 3 rotation components , at each control point .",
    "the spatial integrals were performed with a gauss quadrature scheme with 27 gauss points and the microplane integration was carried out by a novel integration scheme based on the voronoi discretization of the unit sphere with 66 microplanes .    based on the results presented in the paper the following conclusions",
    "can be drawn :    1 .   the implemented finite element with adoption of the hom model as constitutive equation performs very well in the numerical simulations of classical high order elasticity problems .",
    "this was verified by simulating bending of strain - gradient elastic cantilever beams and computing the stress concentration due to a circular hole in a cosserat elastic plate subject to tension .",
    "2 .   the hom formulation with softening constitutive laws is only partially regularized and it shows mesh dependence in the softening branch close to the peak load .",
    "the regularization technique previously proposed bt cusatis and zhou @xcite solves the mesh dependency in the initial post peak but leads to stress locking and lack of clear convergence in the far post peak .",
    "an optimal regularization of the post peak response is obtained by introducing the regularizing term on the high order stress increments as opposed to the total high order stresses . with this approach",
    "a clear convergence can be observed for both the load versus displacement curve and the strain profile along the bar .",
