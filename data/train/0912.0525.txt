    "i will focus here on the formation and evolution of massive black holes ( mbhs ) , in high - redshift galaxies , and their symbiotic evolution with their hosts .",
    "mbhs weighing million solar masses and above have been recognized as the engines that power quasars detected at early cosmic times .",
    "dynamical evidence also indicates that mbhs with masses in the range @xmath1 ordinarily dwell in the centers of most nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "mbhs populate galaxy centers today , and shone as quasars in the past ; the quiescent mbhs that we detect now in nearby bulges would be the dormant remnants of this fiery past , suggesting a single mechanism for assembling mbhs and forming galaxies .",
    "the surprisingly clear correlations between mbh masses and the properties of their host galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) may well extend down to the smallest masses , for example , the dwarf seyfert  1 galaxies pox 52 and ngc 4395 are thought to contain a mbh of mass @xmath2 @xcite . at the other end , however , some powerful quasars , powered by super - massive black holes with masses @xmath3 @xcite , have already been detected at @xmath4 , corresponding to a time less than a tenth of the age of the universe , roughly one billion years after the big bang .",
    "we are therefore left with the task of explaining the presence of billion solar masses mbhs when the universe is less than 1 gyr old , and of much smaller mbhs lurking in 13 gyr old galaxies . the outstanding questions concern how and when `` seed '' mbhs formed , the frequency of mbhs in galaxies , and how efficiently mbh seeds grew in mass during the first few billion years of their lives .",
    "the  flow chart \" presented by @xcite still stands as a guideline for the possible paths leading to formation of massive mbh seeds in the center of galactic structures . in this paper",
    "i will concentrate on the currently favoured scenarios .",
    "one of the most popular scenarios for mbh formation associates mbh seeds with the remnants of the first generation of stars , formed out of zero metallicity gas .",
    "the first stars are expected to form in minihalos , @xmath5 collapsing at @xmath6 from the highest peaks of the primordial density field , where cooling is possible by means of molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "simulations of the collapse of primordial molecular clouds @xcite suggest that the first generation of stars contained many ` very massive stars ' ( vmss ) with @xmath7 .",
    "this is because of the slow subsonic contraction set up by molecular hydrogen cooling .",
    "further fragmentation into sub - components is not seen although it is not clear if this is a numerical effect , rather than due to the gas physics @xcite .",
    "if the first stars retain their high mass until death , they will collapse after a short ( @xmath8 myrs ) life - time .",
    "the final fate depends on the exact mass of the star .",
    "between 25 and 140 @xmath9 , low - metallicity stars form black holes directly .",
    "it is likely , however , that such light black holes wander within their hosts , dynamically interacting with stars of similar mass , rather than settle at the center of the galaxy s potential well .",
    "between approximately 140 and 260 @xmath9 lies the domain of pair instability supernovae .",
    "these objects are completely disrupted by nuclear - powered explosions , leaving no remnants @xcite .",
    "going to still more massive stars ( over 260 @xmath9 ) the nuclear energy released when the star collapses on the pair instability is not sufficient to reverse the implosion .",
    "a massive black hole , containing at least half of the initial stellar mass , is born inside the star @xcite .",
    "a numerous population of mbhs may have been the endproduct of the first episode of pregalactic star formation ; since they form in density high peaks , relic mbhs with mass @xmath10 would be predicted to cluster in the cores of more massive halos formed by subsequent mergers @xcite .",
    "although this path to mbh formation seems very natural , large uncertainties exist on the final mass of popiii stars . if the first stars formed in multiples per halo the mass function would be less top - heavy @xcite . and",
    ", if single objects are formed , the characteristic final mass at the end of the accretion process can be much less than the initial clump mass due to feedback effects @xcite .",
    "another family of models for mbh formation relies on the collapse of supermassive objects formed directly out of dense gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the physical conditions ( density , gas content ) in the inner regions of mainly gaseous proto - galaxies make these locii natural candidates , because the very first proto - galaxies were by definition metal - free , or at the very least very metal - poor .",
    "enriched halos have a more efficient cooling , which in turn favors fragmentation and star formation over the efficient collection of gas conducive to mbh formation .",
    "it has been suggested that efficient gas collapse probably occurs only in massive halos with virial temperatures @xmath11k under metal - free conditions where the formation of h@xmath12 is inhibited @xcite , or for gas enriched below the critical metallicity threshold for fragmentation @xcite . for these systems",
    "the tenuous gas cools down by atomic hydrogen only until it reaches @xmath13 k. at this point the cooling function of atomic hydrogen drops by a few orders of magnitude , and contraction proceeds nearly adiabatically .",
    "finally , it has been recently suggested that highly turbulent systems are also likely to experience a limited amount of fragmentation , suggesting that efficient gas collapse could proceed also in metal - enriched galaxies at later cosmic epochs @xcite .    in such halos where fragmentation is suppressed , and cooling proceeds gradually , the gaseous component can cool and contract until rotational support halts the collapse . in the most common situations ,",
    "rotational support can halt the collapse before densities required for mbh formation are reached .",
    "additional mechanisms inducing transport of angular momentum are needed to further condense the gas until conditions fostering mbh formation are achieved",
    ". an appealing route to efficient angular momentum shedding is by global dynamical instabilities , such as the  bars - within - bars \" mechanism @xcite .",
    "a bar can transport angular momentum outward on a dynamical timescale via gravitational and hydrodynamical torques , allowing the radius to shrink .",
    "provided that the gas is able to cool , this shrinkage leads to even greater instability , on shorter timescales , and the process cascades .",
    "this mechanism is a very attractive candidate for collecting gas in the centers of halos , because it works on a dynamical time and can operate over many decades of radius .",
    "an alternative way of describing mass - inflow is via the toomre stability parameter , @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath14 approaches unity a disc is subject to gravitational instabilities .",
    "if the destabilization of the system is not too violent , instabilities lead to mass infall instead of fragmentation and global star formation @xcite .",
    "this is the case if the inflow rate is below a critical threshold @xmath15 the disk is able to sustain ( @xmath16 describes the viscosity ) and molecular and metal cooling are not important .",
    "such an unstable disc develops non - axisymmetric spiral structures , which effectively redistribute angular momentum , causing mass inflow .",
    "this process stops when the amount of mass transported to the center is enough to make the disc marginally stable .",
    "after gas has efficiently accumulated in the center , what happens next ?",
    "the gas made available in the central compact region can then form a central massive object . depending on how fast and efficiently the mass accumulation proceeds",
    ", the exact outcome would differ .",
    "it is generally thought that vmss supported by radiation pressure evolve as an @xmath17 polytrope @xcite .",
    "the fate of a marginally unstable , maximally rotating vms has been investigated numerically in full general relativity by @xcite .",
    "they found that the final object is a kerr - like black hole ( spin parameter @xmath80.75 ) containing 90% of the stellar mass .",
    "the fate of an isolated vms is therefore the formation of a mbh",
    ".    if the mass accumulation is fast , however , the outer layers of vmss are not thermally relaxed during much of the main sequence lifetime of the star @xcite .",
    "such vmss can have a complex structure with a convective ( polytropic ) core surrounded by a convectively stable envelope .",
    "after exhausting its hydrogen , the core of a vms will contract and heat up until it suffers catastrophic neutrino losses and collapses .",
    "the initial black hole , with mass of a few @xmath9 , formed as a result of core - collapse subsequently grows via accretion from the bloated envelopes that result (  quasistars  , an initially low - mass black hole embedded within a massive , radiation - pressure - supported envelope ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . over time",
    ", the black hole grows at the expense of the envelope , until finally the growing luminosity succeeds in unbinding the envelope and the seed mbh is unveiled .",
    "the key feature of this scenario is that while the black hole is embedded within the envelope , its growth is limited by the eddington limit for the whole quasistar , rather than that appropriate for the black hole mass itself .",
    "very rapid growth can then occur at early times , when the envelope mass greatly exceeds the black hole mass .",
    "the masses of the seeds predicted by different models of gas infall and vms structure vary , but they are typically in the range @xmath18 ( figure  [ fig : mf ] ) .      efficient gas collapse , leading to mbh seed formation , is mutually exclusive with star formation , as competition for the gas supply limits the mass available .",
    "formation of ` normal ' low  mass stars , however , opens up a new scenario for mbh seed formation , if stellar - dynamical rather than gas - dynamical processes are at play .",
    "this first episode of efficient star formation can foster the formation of very compact nuclear star clusters @xcite where star collisions can lead to the formation of a vms , possibly leaving a mbh remnant with mass in the range @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite investigate the process of runaway collisions directly with hydrodynamical simulations and show that during collisions large mass losses are likely , at metallicities larger than 10@xmath20 solar .",
    "the growth of a vms should be much more efficient at low metallicity .",
    "low metallicity can modify the picture in different ways .",
    "first , at sub - solar ( but non - zero ) metallicity , stars with masses @xmath21 are thought to collapse directly into a black hole without exploding as supernovae .",
    "second , the mass loss due to winds is much more reduced in metal - poor stars , which greatly helps in increasing the mass of the final remnant .    @xcite investigate the formation of mbhs , remnants of vms formed via stellar collisions in the very first stellar clusters at early cosmic times .",
    "the main features of the model are as follows : we consider halos with virial temperatures @xmath22 k after the first episode of star formation , hence with a low , but non - zero , metallicity gas content .",
    "this set of assumptions ensures that ( i ) atomic hydrogen cooling can contribute to the gas cooling process , ( ii ) a uv field has been created by the first stars , and ( iii ) the gas inside the halo has been mildly polluted by the first metals .",
    "the second condition implies that at low density h@xmath12 is dissociated and does not contribute to cooling .",
    "the third condition ensures that gas can fragment and form low - mass stars only if the gas density is above a certain threshold , @xmath23 ( which depends on the metallicity , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : this causes only the highest density regions of a proto - galactic disc to be prone to star formation .    in toomre - unstable proto - galactic discs , such as those described in the previous section , instabilities",
    "lead to mass infall instead of fragmentation into bound clumps and global star formation in the entire disk .",
    "the gas inflow increases the central density , and within a certain , compact , region @xmath24 . here",
    "star formation ensues and a dense star cluster is formed . at metallicities",
    "@xmath25 solar , the typical star cluster masses are of order @xmath26 and the typical half mass radii @xmath27 pc .",
    "most star cluster therefore go into core collapse in @xmath28 3 myr , and runaway collisions of stars form a vms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to a mbh remnant .    as the metallicity of the universe increases , the critical density for fragmentation decreases and stars start to form in the entire protogalactic disk",
    "as gas is consumed by star formation , the inflow of gas is no longer efficient , more extended clusters form , and the core collapse timescale increases until it exceeds the main sequence lifetime of massive stars .",
    "@xcite find that typically a fraction @xmath29 of protogalaxies at @xmath30 form black hole seeds , with masses @xmath31 , leading to a mass density in seeds of a few @xmath32 .",
    "most of the assumptions in @xcite have been conservative , but still the population of seeds is comparable to the case of population iii star remnants discussed , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the fraction of high - redshift galaxies seeded with a mbh is about a factor of 10 below the direct collapse case presented in @xcite , where a seed was assumed to form with a 100% efficiency whenever a protogalaxy disk was toomre unstable .",
    "what are the possible observational tests of mbh formation scenarios ? figure  [ fig : mf ] shows three mass functions for three different mbh ` seed ' models : direct collapse @xcite , runaway stellar mergers in high - redshift clusters @xcite , and population iii remnants @xcite .",
    "these are the initial conditions that we would like to probe . in this section",
    ", i will focus on discriminants for two different , extreme , scenarios : ` light seeds ' , derived from population iii remnants , and ` heavy seeds ' , derived from direct gas collapse .          since during the quasar epoch ( @xmath33 ) mbhs increase their mass by a large factor @xcite , signatures of the seed formation mechanisms are likely more evident at _ earlier epochs_. if accretion is efficient , it washes out any trace of the initial seed population .",
    "@xcite find that of the contribution to the quasar luminosity budget at @xmath4 is dominated by mbhs with mass @xmath34 .",
    "such small , low - luminosity mbhs do not contribute to the bright end of the luminosity function of quasars , and are therefore difficult to account from simple extrapolations of the luminosity function of quasars .",
    "these small holes are not hosted in extremely massive galaxies residing in the highest density peaks ( 5 to 6@xmath35 peaks ) , but are instead found in more common , `` normal '' systems , @xmath36 , peaks .",
    "future generation of space  based telescopes , such as _ jwst _ and _ ixo _ , are likely to detect and constrain the evolution of the population of accreting massive black holes at early times ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "detection of gravitational waves from seeds merging at the redshift of formation @xcite is probably one of the best ways to discriminate among formation mechanisms .",
    "_ lisa _ in principle is sensible to gravitational waves from binary mbhs with masses in the range @xmath38 basically at any redshift of interest",
    ". a large fraction of coalescences will be directly observable by _ lisa _ , and on the basis of the detection rate , constraints can be put on the mbh formation process . @xcite and @xcite analyze merger histories of mbhs along the hierarchical build  up of cosmic structures @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that a decisive diagnostic is provided by the distribution of the mass ratios in binary coalescences .",
    "models where seeds start large predict that most of the detected events involve equal mass binaries .",
    "a fraction of observable coalescences , in fact , involve mbhs at @xmath39 , when mbhs had no time to accrete much mass yet . as most seeds form with similar mass , mergers at early times involve mbh binaries with mass ratio @xmath40 . in scenarios based on population iii remnants ,",
    "@xmath39 mergers involve mbhs with mass below the _ lisa _ threshold .",
    "the detectable events happen at later times , when mbhs have already experienced a great deal of mass growth yielding a mass ratio distribution which is flat or features a broad peak at mass ratios @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite determine the detectability of events by using a code that includes both spin precession and higher harmonics in the gravitational - wave signal , and carrying out monte carlo simulations to determine the number of events that can be detected and accurately localized in these population models .",
    "lisa will detect a significant fraction of all mergers : almost all mergers will be detected in heavy - seed scenarios , and nearly half of all mergers in small - seed scenarios . for heavy - seed models most mergers detectable with high signal - noise - ratio ( s / n@xmath4210 ) occur in the redshift range @xmath43 , with a peak around @xmath44 . in the case of light seeds , mergers are roughly uniform in @xmath45 over the range @xmath46 .",

    "as mbhs grow from lower - mass seeds , it is natural to expect that a leftover population of progenitor mbhs should also exist in the present universe .",

    "the signatures of mbh formation mechanisms will consequently be stronger in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",

    "2009 ) find that for the most part mbhs hosted in milky way satellites retain the original ` seed ' mass , thus providing a clear indication of what the properties of the seeds were .",
