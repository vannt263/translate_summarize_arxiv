    "globular cluster ( gc ) systems are always present in large galaxies .",
    "it is generally believed that gcs form when starbursts occur in galaxies , and as ` fossil records ' , contain vital information on the formation and evolution of their parent galaxies @xcite . despite their close interplay between gcs and field stars ,",
    "the comparative studies have uncovered a fundamental difference in the observed shapes of their metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) , even within the relatively simple type of galaxies  elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the cause of the discrepancy between these two prime stellar components of galaxies has been the topic of much interest both on theoretical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observational grounds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because the disagreement signifies highly decoupled evolutionary paths between gc systems and their parent galaxies .",
    "the most common technique for measuring metallicities of a substantially large sample of gcs is _ photometry _  obtaining their broadband colors , although it is no substitute for spectroscopy .",
    "because gcs in the milky way and other galaxies are usually older than 10 gyr and age does not strongly affect gc broadband colors of gcs this old , the main parameter governing gc colors is metallicity .",
    "indeed , the overall , first - order feature of the color - metallicity relations ( hereafter `` cmrs '' ) is that gc colors scale _ linearly _ with their metallicities .",
    "empirical relationships between the most often used color , @xmath3 , and [ fe / h ] , fitted mainly to the galactic gcs @xcite , are approximately linear . using the more metallicity - sensitive colors @xmath4 or @xmath5 ,",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found a mildly quadratic or broken linear relationship between [ fe / h ] and color to be a better fit , thus improving on the relation of @xcite .    with the linear or mildly curved color - to - metallicity conversion , the now well - documented observation of bimodality in gc color distributions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been translated into bimodality of their mdfs .",
    "this is where a sharp distinction between gcs and field stars takes place ; independent studies via _ direct _ photometry of spatially - resolved constituent field stars in a dozen nearby galaxies have shown that their mdfs have , in general , strongly - peaked , _ unimodal _ [ fe / h ] distributions with broad metal - poor tails .",
    "more recent observations and modeling of old star clusters , however , suggest that the relations between metallicity and broadband color for gcs have a subtle , second - order feature ; they appear to be nonlinear with a quasi - inflection at intermediate metallicities .",
    "for instance , @xcite presented an empirical relationship between the @xmath6 colors and spectroscopic metallicities for gcs in the milky way and the giant elliptical galaxies , m49 and m87 ( see their figure 11 ) . with this dataset",
    ", they showed that the relationship between [ fe / h ] and @xmath6 is steep for [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath80.8 , shallow up to [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath80.5 , and then possibly steep again at higher metallicities .    independently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) presented a theoretical metallicity - to - color relationship that has a significant inflection and thus reproduces well the observed feature .",
    "this nonlinear nature of the relation between intrinsic metallicity and its proxy , colors , may hold the key to understanding the color bimodality phenomenon .",
    "paper i showed that the wavy feature projects equidistant metallicity intervals near the quasi - inflection point onto larger color intervals , and thus produces bimodal gc color distributions when the underlying distribution in [ fe / h ] is broad , even if it is unimodal .",
    "the scenario gives a simple and cohesive explanation for the key observations , including ( @xmath10 ) the overall shape of color histograms , ( @xmath11 ) the number ratio of blue and red gcs as a function of host galaxy luminosity , and ( @xmath12 ) the peak colors of _ both _ blue and red gcs as a function of host luminosity .",
    "if the bona - fide shape of the color - metallicity relationship is highly inflected , what has been thought to be the mdfs of gc systems may deviate significantly from the true distributions .    in this paper",
    ", we present an alternative way of resolving the long - standing discrepancy in the mdfs between gcs and halo stars in bright elliptical galaxies . the nonlinear conversion from metallicities to colors",
    "( paper i ) should not be irreversible , and here we try to _ inverse - transform _ color distributions of gcs into metallicity distributions using the nonlinear cmrs .",
    "section 2 presents the pros and cons of the nonlinearity of cmrs , on which the present work is based .",
    "section 3 applies the nonlinear color - to - metallicity conversion to the actual gc color distributions , and examines the inferred [ fe / h ] distributions for m87 and m84 (   3.1 ) and for the 100 early - type galaxies in the acs virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) (   3.2 ) .",
    "section 4 compares the inferred gc mdfs with the mdfs of spatially - resolved constituent stars of nearby galaxies (   4.1 and   4.2 ) and the mdfs from a simple chemical enrichment model of galaxies (   4.3 ) .",
    "section 5 discusses the implications of our results on the color bimodality issues (   5.1 ) , addresses the question of whether the gc formation is coupled with the bulk formation of the stellar population of host galaxies (   5.2 ) , and finally presents our view on the formation and evolution of gc systems and their parent galaxies (   5.3 ) .",
    "the core of this work is that the mdfs derived from gc optical color distributions are similar to those of constituent halo stars in galaxies .",
    "this work is based on the nonlinearity - cmr hypothesis ( paper i ) , that has been a target of dispute after its announcement .",
    "the issue is important enough that we devote a section to discuss it .",
    "simple linear conversion of photometric colors is frequently used for estimating metallicities for large samples of extragalactic gcs .",
    "this is a reasonable first - order assumption for obtaining mean metallicities , but for investigating the detailed structure of the mdf , including possible subpopulations , the form of the cmr must be known to higher order .",
    "however , the best empirical color - metallicity calibrations currently available ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) exhibit notable observational scatter .",
    "moreover , compared to tens of thousands of gcs in a typical giant elliptical , the calibration samples are still relatively small and sparsely populated at the high - metallicity end .",
    "larger samples of high - quality spectroscopic metallicities are needed to establish the precise forms of cmrs .",
    "such samples would implicitly include any correlations with age or other parameters , and would provide strong constraints on the theoretical models .    in general , the slope of the dependence of a given photometric color on the logarithmic metallicity [ fe / h ] will change as a function of metallicity , and several recent studies have found departures from linearity .",
    "for instance , it has been known for decades that the color of the giant branch in galactic gcs is a nonlinear function of [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , using the observed @xmath4 versus [ fe / h ] relation of @xcite , showed that the shape of the color distribution would differ from that of the mdf , and a non - peaked metallicity distribution could result in a bimodal color distribution .",
    "@xcite fitted nonlinear relations for @xmath4 color versus [ fe / h ] , and found that the inferred mdf changed significantly depending on the adopted relation .",
    "@xcite fitted a quartic relation to the @xcite data and showed that the empirical fit produces bimodal @xmath6 colors from unimodal mdfs .",
    "as the observations have improved , so have the models , and these also tend to predict nonlinear cmrs ( e.g. , lee et  al .",
    "2002 ; paper i ; cantiello & blakeslee 2007 ) .",
    "this is partly , but not totally , due to improved modeling of the horizontal branch .",
    "kissler - patig et  al .",
    "( 1998a ) showed that the worthey ( 1994 ) models predict a nonlinear relation between [ fe / h ] and @xmath3 , with a wavy form qualitatively similar to that found empirically by @xcite , although the inflection occurs at higher metallicity because the colors of these models are generally too red at the high - metallicity end ( see blakeslee et  al .",
    "this is interesting because the worthey models do not realistically model the horizontal - branch morphology , but treat it as a red clump near the giant branch with a position that varies according to age .",
    "the lee et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) model colors clearly showed nonlinear behavior as a function of metallicity even without any horizontal - branch component , but the nonlinearity in the optical colors was more pronounced with the horizontal branch .    despite the advances ,",
    "more work is needed , especially on the behavior of the horizontal branch in extragalactic gc systems , as this is a complex multi - parameter problem .",
    "metallicity is the primary factor governing horizontal - branch temperature , and the transition occurs in a nonlinear way at intermediate metallicities ( e.g. , lee et  al .",
    "however , variations in other parameters , including age , helium content , and central density , can create significant scatter in horizontal - branch morphology at a given metallicity ( e.g. , sandage & wildey 1967 ; zinn 1980 ; stetson et  al .",
    "1996 , sarajedini et  al.1997 ; buonanno et  al .  1997",
    "; sweigart & catelan 1998 ; see also the recent discussions by yoon et  al .",
    "2008 ; gratton et  al .  2010",
    "; dotter et  al .",
    "there are also intricate intercorrelations among these parameters , as well as correlations with gc mass .",
    "for instance , the color - magnitude relation found among the brightest gcs in external systems ( e.g. harris et  al .",
    "2006 ; strader et  al .",
    "2006 ; mieske et  al .  2006 , 2010 ;",
    "peng et  al .",
    "2009 ) is likely the result of a mass - metallicity relation . in galactic gcs ,",
    "the presence of an extreme blue horizontal branch correlates strongly with gc mass ( lee et  al .",
    "2007 ) , and is likely related to the presence of helium - enhanced subpopulations ( e.g. , norris et  al .  2004 ; lee et  al .",
    "2005b ; piotto et  al .",
    "2005 ; yoon et  al .",
    "2008 ; han et  al .",
    "2009 ; gratton et  al .  2010 ) .",
    "more massive gcs also have smaller half - light radii and higher central densities ( van den bergh 1996 ) . finally , there is some evidence for correlations between age and metallicity in both the galactic and extragalactic gc systems ( puzia et  al .",
    "2005 ; beasley et  al .  2008 ; marn - franch et  al .",
    "2009 ) , but the degree of correlation must depend on the formation history of the gc system .    to summarize , the best current data indicate that optical cmrs for gc systems are nonlinear , and multiple sets of models support this general result",
    ". however , exactly how colors vary with metallicity depends on ages , the age - metallicity relations , and variations in other parameters such as @xmath13-element and helium contents . thus",
    ", a complete picture of the multi - band color - metallicity behavior in extragalactic gc systems would include an understanding of the interplay of the various stellar population parameters .",
    "lacking more stringent observational constraints , we consider only some simple , reasonable assumptions on the standard stellar parameters , and for the present work , we use our best predicted cmrs .",
    "the gc system of the milky way galaxy follows a bimodal mdf ( zinn 1985 ) .",
    "the bimodality is confirmed by the radial number density profiles of metal - poor and metal - rich gcs and their orbital characteristics .",
    "the metallicity distribution of gcs and field stars in our galaxy are known much more accurately than those in any other galaxy .",
    "for instance , the metal - poor gcs in the milky way have formed with an efficiency @xmath14 20 times greater than the metal - rich gcs with respect to their associated stellar populations .",
    "although these were well known , there was little expectation that it would be a general property of much larger gc systems in giant ellipticals .",
    "such galaxies contain 10 - 100 times as many gcs as the milky way , and reside predominantly in cluster environments where they likely experienced very different evolutionary histories ( e.g. , peng et  al .",
    "2008 ) ; thus , the analogy with our own galaxy was unclear .",
    "in the context of the toomre ( 1977 ) idea that elliptical galaxies are the remnants of dissipationally merged spirals , ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) discussed bimodal mdfs with a population of higher metallicity gcs forming in the major merger .",
    "nonetheless , given the simplicity of that model , and the advances in hierarchical structure formation theory , it came as a surprise when most giant ellipticals exhibited bimodal gc color distributions ( interpreted as linearly reflecting metallicity ) , and other scenarios were proposed to account for the bimodality ( e.g. , forbes et  al .  1997 ; ct et  al .",
    "1998 ; beasley et  al .  2002 ; kravtsov & gnedin et  al .  2005 ; muratove & gnedin 2010 ) .",
    "however , the presumed bimodality of the mdf is taken as an input constraint in these models , rather than being a clear prediction ( apart from perhaps the original ashman & zepf scenario , which is difficult to reconcile with the more complex assembly histories of ellipticals found in cosmological simulations ) . in light of this , it is worth reexamining the direct evidence for bimodal mdfs in elliptical galaxies , and other galaxies with comparably large gc systems .",
    "m31 is the largest galaxy in the local group and contains over 450 confirmed gcs , three times as many as the milky way , and hundreds of additional candidates ( galleti et  al .",
    "2004 ; huxor et  al .",
    "2011 ; caldwell et  al .  2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "barmby et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied the optical and near - ir color distributions for a large sample of m31 gcs . unlike in most giant ellipticals",
    ", the colors did not appear bimodal , but barmby et  al .",
    "suggested that errors in reddening and photometry could `` wash out '' the bimodality .",
    "a kmm analysis of the @xmath15 colors favored a double gaussian model over a single gaussian with 92% confidence ( @xmath16 ) , but although the distribution appeared asymmetric , it did not show two distinct components as in the milky way .",
    "the result was similar for the sample of @xmath17 gcs with spectroscopic metallicities compiled by these authors ( see their figure  19 ) .",
    "galleti et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) presented a homogeneous set of metallicities from lick index measurements for 245 gcs .",
    "again , they found that multiple gaussian component models were favored because the mdf is broad and asymmetric , but it lacks the two distinct metallicity peaks seen in the milky way ( see their figure  15 ) .",
    "when the sample was restricted to m31 gcs with errors @xmath18  dex , there was no appearance of bimodality .",
    "galleti et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) conclude , `` the md[f ] of m31 gcs does not present any obvious structure like the bimodality encountered in the gc systems of the mw [ milky way ] .",
    "nevertheless , the distribution for m31 clusters does not seem to be well represented by a single gaussian distribution@xmath19 while clearly not conclusive , the above analysis suggests that there may be actual structures in the md[f ] of m31 gcs . ''    in the most recent study of the m31 gc mdf , @xcite present high signal - to - noise spectroscopic data on the m31 gc system .",
    "metallicities were estimated using a calibration of lick indices with [ fe / h ] provided by galactic gcs . although caldwell et al",
    ". sample does not include many outer - halo metal - poor gcs that would increase the significance of the metal - poor side of the mdf , the metallicity distribution of over 300 old gcs has a significant population of intermediate - metallicity gcs and is not generally bimodal , in strong distinction with the bimodal galactic gc distribution .",
    "the mdf shows a broad peak , centered at [ fe / h ] = @xmath20 , possibly with minor peaks at [ fe / h ] = @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , suggesting that the gc systems of m31 and the milky way had different formation histories .",
    "given the complex accretion history of m31 ( mcconnachie et  al .",
    "2009 ) , it is not surprising that the m31 gc mdf would possess significant structure , but the best current data do not present evidence for bimodality in the m31 gc system .",
    "we note in passing that the balmer absorption lines ( h@xmath24 , h@xmath25 and h@xmath26 ) theoretically have nearly the same response to horizontal - branch stars as optical broadband colors in their index - metallicity relations ( e.g. , lee et  al .",
    "2000 ; chul et  al .",
    "2011 , in prep . ; s. kim et  al .",
    "2011 ( paper iv ) ) .",
    "remarkably , @xcite s sample shows strong nonlinearity in the balmer lines vs. metal line ( @xmath7fe@xmath27 ) relations ( see their figure 10 ) , and , as a result , exhibits clear balmer strength bimodality ( see their figure 6 ) which is a close analogy with optical color bimodality .",
    "the case for mdf bimodality is better in ngc5128 ( cen  a ) , an s0  pec galaxy at the center of its own small group ( karachentsev et  al .",
    "beasley et",
    "al.(2008 ) present spectroscopic metallicities for 207 gcs in this galaxy .",
    "the resulting mdf is skewed towards high metallicities and apparently has three closely spaced peaks ( see their figure 5 ) , in contrast to the two well - separated peaks in the milky way .",
    "this difference in mdf structure likely reflects the very different accretion histories .",
    "a very similar mdf was found by woodley et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) in a spectroscopic study of 72 ngc5128 gcs . in this case , a unimodal distribution provided statistically the best fit , but their [ mgfe ] index distribution was better fitted with a double gaussian model . in both studies , the ngc5128 gc metallicities and [ mgfe ] values",
    "lack the sharply bimodal appearance of the optical colors , especially of @xmath28 and @xmath3 ( peng et  al .",
    "however , spitler et  al.(2008 ) find that the optical[3.6@xmath29 m ] ir color distributions for 146 ngc5128 gcs are distinctly bimodal , providing good evidence for mdf bimodality .",
    "they also found that similar data for a smaller sample of gcs in ngc4594 ( the sombrero ) did not provide significant evidence for or against mdf bimodality in that galaxy .",
    "more recently , @xcite present a spectroscopic mdf for over 200 gcs in this galaxy , which is bimodal with peaks at [ fe / h ] @xmath14 @xmath21 and @xmath30 .      various studies of gc metallicities in giant ellipticals from spectroscopic and near - ir / optical photometric data ( puzia et  al .  2002 , 2005 ; cohen et  al .  2003 ; strader et  al .  2007",

    "kundu & zepf 2007 ) are discussed in detail by blakeslee et  al .",
    "we summarize here and refer the reader to that work for the full discussion .",
    "despite the groundbreaking nature of many of these studies , the spectroscopic results tend to be limited by the sample sizes ( @xmath31 of the population ) , sample definitions , or sensitivity to the treatment of the data . thus , blakeslee et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) conclude that the _ direct _ evidence for metallicity bimodality in giant ellipticals is weak .",
    "for example , the bimodality reported by strader et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) in the sample of 47 m49 gc metallicities derived from the cohen et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) lick index measurements depended on the calibration above solar metallicity . despite the very pronounced color bimodality",
    ", there was no significant evidence for bimodality in the metallicities reported by cohen et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which extended to higher metallicities , rather than forming a clump near the solar value as in strader et  al .",
    "given the uncertainty in the high - metallicity calibration ( see discussion in cohen et  al . ) , and the sample limitations ( 0.6% of the gc population , observed with two spectroscopic masks ) , the issue remains unresolved for m49 .",
    "more recently , foster et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) have studied the caii triplet ( cat ) feature in a sample of 144 gcs in the eridanus giant elliptical ngc1407 , which has prominent optical color bimodality . in galactic gcs ,",
    "the cat index is linearly related to metallicity , at least for @xmath32}<-0.4 $ ] ( armandroff & zinn 1988 ) , and models indicate that it is very insensitive to age ( vazdekis et  al .",
    "foster et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) find that bright gcs near the peaks of the color distribution have very similar cat strengths , indicating very similar metallicities despite the wide separation in color space .",
    "the distribution of cat - derived metallicities does not appear bimodal , but because of its asymmetry , it is better fitted by a double gaussian model at the @xmath33 level .",
    "however , if this result were interpreted as mdf bimodality , then the components would differ significantly in amplitude , width , and position from those implied by the optical colors ; i.e. , it would be a different bimodality .",
    "foster et  al .  remark that if the metallicities are taken at face value , then the very different color and metallicity distributions could be reconciled by a nonlinear cmr causing a unimodal mdf to appear bimodal in color space .    in a recent near - ir / optical photometric study",
    ", @xcite presented the @xmath34 color distribution of 80 gcs in m87 , which shows bimodality .",
    "more recently , @xcite present ( optical  near - ir ) colors for the gc systems in 14 early - type galaxies , and find that the bimodality becomes less evident in @xmath35 if compared to @xmath6 and even less pronounced in @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite point out that the disappearance of bimodality in these colors while evident in the optical @xmath6 color could be attributed to a nonlinear - cmr effect although the observational uncertainties could also account for it .",
    "finally , we note that our new studies combining acs and wfc3/ir data for ngc1399 in the fornax galaxy cluster ( blakeslee et  al .",

    "_ direct _ measures of metallicity than colors ",
    "suggest bimodality , it is much less apparent than the dramatic double - peaked histograms of colors for the same galaxies ( e.g. , peng et  al .",
    "thus , at least _",
    "some _ of the observed color bimodality is likely due to nonlinear behavior of colors with metallicity .",
    "as discussed above , there is empirical evidence for such nonlinearity having a form that tends to produce bimodal color distributions .",
    "pipino et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) , considering the results of puzia et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , also concluded that color - metallicity nonlinearity would help significantly in reconciling the photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "the question of the relative importance of color - metallicity nonlinearity and metallicity bimodality in producing the observed gc color distributions remains open . in the meantime , besides the necessity of better spectroscopic samples , it is worthwhile to explore the possibility of deriving mdfs from the observed colors under the assumption of nonlinear cmrs .",
    "the following sections use the latest stellar population models to invert the colors for very large photometric samples and to examine the implications of the resulting mdfs .",
    "our main objective is to investigate the mdfs for gc systems when inferred from the nonlinear cmrs .",
    "compared to the metallicity - to - color conversion shown in paper i , the inverse - conversion from colors to metallicity is more susceptible to the inevitable incompleteness of current population synthesis models . with a theoretical cmr that is somewhat incorrect in the color direction ,",

    "we have selected m87 and m84 , giant elliptical galaxies in the virgo cluster , because they both have gc systems with confirmed color bimodality in @xmath6 and are among very few elliptical galaxies with deep @xmath38-band observations available .",
    "we refer the reader to yoon et  al .",
    "( 2011 , hereafter paper ii ) for greater details on the multiband photometry of the m87 gc system in the context of nonlinear cmrs .",

    "our @xmath39-band catalogs were matched with acs / wfc @xmath40- and @xmath41-band photometry of jordn et al ( 2009 ) .",
    "we hereafter refer to @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 mags as @xmath38 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "jordn et al ( 2009 ) selected _ bona - fide _ gcs with their magnitudes , @xmath6 colors , and sizes .",
    "we further employed color cuts in the @xmath38-band colors to filter out contaminating sources , especially background star - forming galaxies .",
    "we used 591 gcs in m87 and 306 gcs in m84 that have reliable @xmath38 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 measurements in common .",
    "the samples are @xmath38-band limited .",
    "the merit of the multiband observations is clear : since the form of cmrs hinges on which color is used , the shape of the color distributions varies significantly depending on the colors in use .",
    "hence a comparative analysis of the gc mdfs that are independently obtained from distributions of different colors will put the nonlinearity hypothesis to the test , as proposed in paper i and paper ii . among other optical colors , the @xmath38-band related colors ( e.g. , @xmath44 and @xmath45 )",
    "are theoretically predicted to exhibit the most distinctive cmrs from other preferred cmrs ( e.g. , for @xmath6 ) , and thus the most adequate to the task .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath38-band colors are significantly less affected by the variation in the horizontal - branch mean temperature , having less inflected , `` smooth '' cmrs than @xmath6 for given ages . therefore ,",
    "for instance , the conversion from @xmath44 color distributions to mdfs via the ( @xmath44)-[fe / h ] relation should be more straightforward than the case of @xmath6 .",
    "the reason why the cmrs for @xmath38-band colors are less inflected than the @xmath6 cmr is two - folded : ( @xmath10 ) the integrated @xmath38-band colors of main - sequence and red - giant - branch stars are smoother functions of metallicity compared to @xmath6 , and ( @xmath11 ) the @xmath38-band colors are less sensitive to the horizontal - branch temperature variation , which is due to the fact that the blueing effect of the optical spectra with increasing horizontal - branch temperature is held back by the balmer discontinuity where the @xmath38-band is located ( yi et  al .",
    "such properties make the @xmath38-band colors good metallicity indicators for a wide range of age , and the @xmath38-band color distributions are expected to be significantly different from distributions of other optical colors such as @xmath6 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",

    "the @xmath6 distribution of the m87 gcs unambiguously displays two peaks around @xmath6 = 1.0 and 1.4 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath44 distribution for the identical sample does not appear to have clear bimodality .",
    "one may argue that the larger observational uncertainties in @xmath38-band weaken the bimodality .",
    "table 3 shows that the typical photometric error of @xmath44 is 2.2 times larger than that of @xmath6 for the entire sample , but at the same time the ranges spanned by the colors are @xmath48(@xmath6 ) = 1.1 mag and @xmath48(@xmath44 ) = 2.1 mag , that is , the baseline of @xmath44 is 1.9 times longer than that of @xmath6 . as a result , the relative sizes of error bars are ( @xmath6 : @xmath44 ) = ( 1.0 : 1.2 ) . in a relative sense , the errors in the two colors are quite comparable to each other .",
    "moreover , paper ii shows that the @xmath45 color , which has _ smallest _ relative errors , still exhibits weaker bimodality in the color distribution compared to the @xmath6 distribution .",
    "it is , therefore , not likely that bimodality in the @xmath44 distribution of m87 gcs is simply blurred by larger observational errors in the @xmath38-band .    the variation in the histogram shape for different colors may suggest that the form of the cmrs varies depending significantly on the colors in use .",

    "the @xmath44 colors of the gcs in the milky way and ngc 5128 were obtained from their @xmath50 colors via the equation , ( @xmath44 ) = 1.014 ( @xmath50 ) + 1.372 , derived from model data for synthetic gcs with combinations of age ( 10 @xmath14 15 gyr of 1 gyr intervals ) and [ fe / h ] ( @xmath51 @xmath14 0.5 dex of 0.1 dex intervals ) . @xmath52- and @xmath53-passband are relatively close to @xmath38- and @xmath42-passband , respectively , and thus @xmath50 has responses to the horizontal - branch morphology in a way that is very similar to @xmath44 .",

    "given the current level of observational accuracy and inhomogeneity of the data , the purpose of our study is not to determine the exact shape of color - metallicity relationships , but to investigate the consequences and implications of the possible nonlinear transformations .",
    "we now consider the inferred gc mdfs .",

    "the two histograms in figure 1@xmath54 are more consistent with each other in terms of their overall shape and peak positions than those shown in figure 1@xmath42 .",
    "we note that our stellar population models show that , for given input parameters , the _ absolute _ quantities of output are rather subject to the choice of model ingredients such as stellar evolutionary tracts and model flux libraries ; the different choices can result in up to @xmath14 0.2 mag @xmath6 and @xmath44 variation among models and the inferred [ fe / h ] values accordingly ( up to @xmath14 0.5 dex ) .",
    "hence , one should put more weight on the _ relative _ values of inferred gc mdfs , i.e. , the overall morphology of the mdfs and their unimodality .",
    "we , however , wish to emphasize that the typical gc mdf shape is obtained invariably from different colors , i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath44 for m87 gcs .",

    "the gc mdfs for the luminous ( @xmath56 @xmath7 @xmath817 ) host bins ( the first to fifth brightest bins ) in particular are strongly peaked with a broad metal - poor tail .",

    "paper i mentioned that the position of the inflection is bluer for younger stellar populations and so if fainter galaxies host gcs younger than brighter counterparts , then a different cmr may apply .",

    "figures 4@xmath124@xmath49 show that the strong bimodality is no longer evident in the inferred mdfs , and the typical shape of the gc mdfs does not depend upon differing age assignment from the faintest host galaxies to the brightest .",

    "moreover , the _ true _ shape of cmrs suggested in this study is still unproven .",

    "the necessity of obtaining photometry of spatially - resolved field stars limits us to nearby galaxies .",

    "the stellar mdfs of individual galaxies were obtained from color - magnitude diagrams of red - giant stars whose colors are highly sensitive to their metallicities .    in figure 5 , we plot the gc mdf shown in figures 3@xmath46 and 4@xmath46 ( they are identical ) .",
    "the data for the plot are presented in table 5 .",
    "the figure shows that the gc mdfs are similar to the mdfs of resolved constituent stars of nearby elliptical galaxies . in particular",
    ", the typical shape of the gc mdfs ( colored solid line in each panel ) , characterized by a sharp peak with a metal - poor tail , is remarkably consistent with those of field stars in nearby galaxies .",
    "by contrast , gc mdfs obtained using the simple linear [ fe / h ] vs. @xmath6 relation ( grey dotted lines ) do not agree with the stellar mdfs .",
    "we note that the metallicity spread of gcs tends to be broader than that of stars .",
    "as indicated in figures 3@xmath123@xmath49 and figures 4@xmath124@xmath49 , the gc mdfs , on the whole , are broader than the stellar mdfs .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that each color histogram of the acsvcs consists of gcs belonging to 3 @xmath14 20 diverse host galaxies , giving an ensemble character of each host luminosity bin .",
    "moreover , the inferred mdfs become broader as the observational uncertainty in color is propagated to metallicity space .",
    "in addition to the noticeable similarities found in the shape of mdfs between gcs and stars , they share a common feature in that their mean metallicity increases with increasing host luminosity . as a result ,",
    "the peak positions of gcs and stars are roughly coincident in each luminosity bin  at [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath81.0 ( faint hosts ) and @xmath80.5 ( bright hosts ) .",
    "this , however , should be taken with great caution because the mean colors of both gcs @xcite and field stars @xcite depend significantly on the sampled radial location in a galaxy",
    ". their mean metallicities gradually decrease with projected radius , as seen in figures 5@xmath46 and 5@xmath47 for the outer- and inner - halo stars of ngc 5128 , respectively .",
    "moreover , observations show that the mean gc color is bluer than stars within an elliptical galaxy as a whole @xcite . more importantly ,",
    "gcs are on average bluer than the unresolved light of the galaxies at the same radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for old stellar populations such as those in elliptical galaxies and gcs , the observed bluer colors imply lower metallicities in all stellar models , thus leading to the conclusion that gcs are typically more metal - poor than field stars in a galaxy . hence it may just be a coincidence that the gc mdfs line up with the field star mdf of the nearest elliptical galaxy . despite these caveats ,",
    "the peak and width of the mdfs of gcs and field stars are similar enough to suggest that both were formed in the same events , which built the major part of the galaxies .",
    "it should be addressed that the [ fe / h ] histogram for ngc 3379 stars ( figure 5@xmath12 ) , despite the overall resemblance to the compared gc mdf , shows an excess of metal - poor stars with a bump at [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath81.2 .",
    "@xcite found the metal - poor stellar halo in ngc 3379 and provided an explanation for why their earlier studies only detected a metal - rich component in the same galaxy .",
    "the ngc 3379 _ hst _ field is at a distance of 12 effective radii , which is more than twice as far as the equally small fields of view for ngc 3377 ( figure 5@xmath11 ) and ngc 5128 ( figures 5@xmath46 and 5@xmath47 ) .",
    "studies of the stellar mdfs of large galaxies have been performed photometrically and concentrate on more central regions of the galaxy where the metal - rich field star population is concentrated .",
    "the radial bias seemed to under - sample metal - poor stars in the earlier studies .",
    "with the recent evidence of metal - poor halo stars emerging at great galactocentric distances , one should not assume that the stellar mdfs are unimodal at all positions .",
    "therefore , this suggests that our interpretation should be more applicable to their main , inner parts of galaxies , less to the remote outskirts .",
    "as envisaged by the ngc 3379 case above , each galaxy has its own evolutionary history .",
    "so a more direct way to assess the similarity between gcs and stars is to compare between the mdfs of spatially - resolved field stars in a galaxy and its _ own _ gc system .",

    "figure 6@xmath46 shows the gc mdf , which is highly concentrated toward the metal - poor side .",
    "if divided at [ fe / h ] = @xmath81.2 where the metal - poor bump of the filed - star mdf is located , the metal - poor gcs outnumber the metal - rich gcs by 25 to 11 . as a result , for the metal - rich half of the mdf , the numbers of gcs are much too small .",
    "by contrast , figure 6@xmath54 displays the gc mdfs based on the yeps relation ( table 2 ) . with the gc mdfs of only 36 clusters , it is not yet clear whether the mdfs of gcs and stars have the same shape .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the gc metallicities are now more evenly distributed , and the proportions of the two metallicity subgroups , when divided at [ fe / h ] = @xmath81.2 , became more comparable ( 21:15 ) than those in figure 6@xmath46 ( 25:11 ) .",
    "interestingly , the inferred gc mdf in figure 6@xmath54 seems very similar to the ngc 3379 field - star mdf in the western half ( farther from the galaxy center ) of the acs / wfc field ( shaded histogram in figure 14 of harris et  al .",
    "2007b )      the new development in linking the observed gc colors to their intrinsic metallicities leads to gc mdfs that are strikingly similar in shape to mdfs of resolved field stars in nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "both the inferred gc mdfs and halo stellar mdfs are characterized by a sharp peak with a metal - poor tail . in this section ,",
    "we proceed to compare the inferred gc mdfs to chemical enrichment models of galaxies .    in figure 7",
    "we compare the inferred gc mdfs for the second brightest ( @xmath56 @xmath9 @xmath820.5 , orange ) and the brightest ( @xmath56 @xmath9 @xmath821.5 , red ) galaxy luminosity bins with the simple closed - box model of chemical evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we plotted the mdfs for this simple model using yields of [ fe / h ] = @xmath80.685 and @xmath80.505 , respectively . with the improved nonlinear relationship between color and metallicity , the general shape of gc mdfs",
    "is in remarkable agreement with that of galaxy chemical enrichment models .",
    "in contrast , the dotted line in each panel represents the inferred gc mdf for the corresponding bin based on the simple straight fit to the data .    despite their resemblance in the general shape ,",
    "the inferred gc mdfs have fewer metal - poor gcs than the simple chemical model .",
    "this is akin to the `` g - dwarf problem '' in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the width of the chemical evolution model can be changed using various kinds of gas infall and stellar feedback , and an accreting - box model of chemical evolution yields narrower distributions that provide a better match with the inferred gc mdfs .",
    "for instance , @xcite remarked that the halo of ngc 5128 ( @xmath56 = @xmath820.9 ) also suffers from the g - dwarf problem in that it lacks metal - poor stars compared to the simple model .",
    "they were able to fit the field star mdf using an accreting - box model of chemical evolution , producing a narrower distribution that is also a better match to the inferred gc mdfs in this study .",
    "there is substantial evidence that gcs are the remnants of star formation events in galaxies , and are linked to the star formation , chemical enrichment , and merging histories of their parent galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , ever since _ direct _ photometry of spatially - resolved constituent stars in a dozen nearby galaxies became possible thanks to the _ hst _ and large ground - based telescopes , the discrepancy between the mdfs of gcs and field stars has remained a conundrum . if gcs mirror field stars across the galaxy histories , the mdfs of gcs and field stars should be similar .",
    "thus , the curious disagreement in metallicity has been interpreted in the context of highly decoupled formation and evolution histories between gcs and constituent stars of their parent galaxies .",
    "current observational data and modeling point convincingly to nonlinear cmrs , which have significant implications for the interpretation of gc color distributions .",
    "we find that the strongly peaked [ fe / h ] distributions inferred from nonlinear cmrs are qualitatively similar to the mdfs of field stars in the spheroidal component of nearby galaxies and to those produced by chemical evolution models of galaxies .",
    "however , whether the inferred gc mdfs represent the intrinsic , true ones is still unproven , and so it may be partly a coincidence .",
    "nevertheless , if the mdfs obtained using stellar population models more closely represent the true gc mdfs , then this would change much of the current thought on the formation of gc systems and their host galaxies .",
    "the next two sections discuss what constraints would our findings pose on formation of gc systems (   5.1 ) and their host galaxies (   5.2 ) . in section 5.3 , we present our view on the formation and evolution of gc systems and their parent galaxies .",
    "remarkable progress has occurred over the past few decades in our understanding of extragalactic gc systems .",
    "one of the most important discoveries is that many galaxies show bimodality in their color distributions , leading to the notion that galaxies possess two distinct subpopulations of gcs .",
    "we showed , however , that the typical gc mdf shape derived from color distributions is unimodal and characterized by a sharp peak with a metal - poor tail .",
    "if confirmed , the inferred gc mdfs may appreciably reduce the demand for the separate formation mechanisms to explain the metal - poor and metal - rich division of gcs .",
    "we warn , though , that the sample used in this study is the gc systems in the virgo galaxy cluster obtained from the _ hst _ acs / wfc , wfpc2 , and wfc3 observations .",
    "the field of view of acs / wfc , for example , covers galaxies haloes within r @xmath9 0.6 , 0.8 , 7.2 , 8.3 , 8.9 , 9.4 , and 10.6 @xmath2 ( in @xmath43-band , ferrarese et  al .",
    "2006 ) for the seven host luminosity bins ( from the brightest bin to the faintest ) of the acsvcs , respectively . nevertheless , the dearth of metal - poor gcs in mdfs for inner spheroids of giant ( @xmath56 @xmath1 @xmath66 ) elliptical galaxies and nearly the entire spheroids of normal ( @xmath66 @xmath1 @xmath56 @xmath1 @xmath67 ) ellipticals suggest that the inheritance of metal - poor gcs via dissipationless accretion from dwarf satellites seems to be less significant than previously thought",
    ".    on the outskirts of giant galaxies , accretion of metal - poor gcs from low - mass satellites and/or from surrounding regions may be an important channel for a galaxy to add gcs on the metal - poor part of gc mdfs @xcite .",
    "recall , however , that one of the main consequences of the nonlinear metallicity - color relations is that their steepness at the metal - poor end naturally creates a blue peak of gcs in color space , which is a direct cause of the conventional subpopulation of blue gcs .",
    "therefore , even for the outskirts of giant galaxies in cluster environments , whether or not accretion of metal - poor gcs is solely responsible for blue peaks of color distributions is still an open question .",
    "the strongest evidence against accretion models is that the blue peak colors are correlated tightly to the host galaxy luminosity ( larsen et  al .",
    "2001 ; strader , brodie & forbes 2004 ; peng et  al .",
    "the metal - poor relation implies that metal - poor gcs , although they formed at very high redshift and were accreted later on , already `` knew '' which galaxy they would ultimately belong to , and thus weakens the accretion scenario for the color bimodality .",
    "alternatively , the nonlinear metallicity - color relations scenario ( paper i ) gives cohesive explanations for the observations that the mean colors of _ both _ blue and red gcs increase progressively for more luminous host galaxies .",
    "further counter - evidence of the accretion model is the significant fraction of blue gcs in massive cluster galaxies in relatively lower - density regions ( peng et  al .",
    "2006 ) and massive field galaxies in isolation ( cho et  al .",
    "in such environments , galaxies have few neighboring lower - mass galaxies , and it would be difficult to acquire many metal - poor gcs via accretion",
    ". therefore , the accretion process seems more important when it meets the three conditions : ( a ) the _ outskirts _ ( rather than the inner , main bodies ) of ( b ) _ giant _ ( rather than dwarf ) ellipticals orbited by a large number of low - mass satellites in ( c ) _ cluster _ ( rather than isolated ) environments . in this",
    "regard , wide - field , multiband studies of gc systems in cluster and field environments are clearly needed .",
    "wide - field photometry of nearby _ cluster _ galaxies in ctio 4-m @xmath52-band ( h. kim et  al .",

    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 ( cho et al .",
    "2011 ) are done or in progress to further investigate our alternative scenario .",
    "current hierarchical models of galaxy formation in the @xmath68cmd cosmology predict that several thousands of small building blocks were involved for the emergence of one single massive galaxy .",
    "this is significant because the extent of complexity may leave little room for the existence of just two gc subpopulations in each massive galaxy .",
    "indeed , the unimodal , skewed mdfs arise naturally in an aggregate of a large number of protogalactic gas clouds from its virtually continuous chemical evolution through many successive rounds of star formation .",
    "the strongly peaked unimodal gc mdfs point to gc formation with a relatively short , quasi - monolithic timescale .",
    "remarkably , the typical gc mdf shape emerges across three orders of magnitude in host galaxy mass .",
    "this suggests that the processes of gc formation and chemical enrichment are quite universal among a variety of gc systems .",
    "we also address the important issue of whether or not the formation of gcs is coupled with the bulk formation of the stellar population of host galaxies . or , equivalently , does gc formation really mirror star formation in a galaxy ?",
    "we have shown that the inferred gc mdfs agree reasonably well with the stellar mdfs of nearby galaxies and the mdfs produced by models of galaxy chemical evolution .",
    "the results suggest that the evolutionary histories of gc systems and their parent galaxies are strongly coupled , and thus share a more common origin and closer subsequent evolution than previously thought .",
    "an important aspect of the gc - host galaxy co - evolution issue concerns the gc - to - star offset , in the sense that gcs are on average more metal - poor than the unresolved light of an elliptical galaxy at the same radial location ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in light of the typical shape of gc mdfs proposed in this study ,",
    "the lower value of the mean metallicity of gcs compared to that of field stars should not be attributed to the number excess of the metal - poor gcs .",
    "alternatively it is more likely that , at a given radial location , the gc mdf on the whole is shifted toward the metal - poor side with a peak at a lower [ fe / h ] value , compared to the field - star mdf .",
    "the gc - to - star offset would point to a picture in which gcs are the remnants of vigorous star burst events in the early stages of galaxy formation , and thus preferentially trace the _",
    "major _ mode of star formation in galaxies .",
    "if so , gc formation was less prolonged than field star formation .",
    "recent observations show that gcs were at least an order of magnitude more massive at birth than now ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the large masses may have been the cause of the earlier truncation of their formation process than that of stars .",
    "consequently , the chemical enrichment process of a gc system appears to have ceased somewhat earlier than that of the field stellar population in each star formation episode .",
    "we further showed a possible age difference among gc systems , in that the gc systems in fainter galaxies are on average younger .",
    "we refer to this as `` gc system downsizing . ''",
    "the gc system downsizing phenomenon appears to further support the similar nature shared by stellar populations of gcs and field stars .",
    "interestingly , recent observations reveal that the gc systems in milky way satellites and some milky way gcs believed to be accreted from satellite dwarf galaxies are relatively younger than the majority of galactic gcs ( e.g. , marn - franch et  al .",
    "2009 )    galaxy downsizing is generally defined by more _ prolonged _ residual star formation in fainter galaxies .",
    "however , the `` gc system downsizing '' involves the idea that the first generation of gcs in fainter hosts are created later than the counterpart in brighter galaxies , and may provide further information on galaxy downsizing itself .",
    "provided that gc systems became attached to the present host galaxies from the beginning , we can speculate that not only the first gcs but also _ first field stars _ were formed earlier in brighter galaxies than fainter galaxies .",
    "that is , massive galaxies today were likely where conditions first favored star formation , thus suggesting a prolonged epoch of galaxy formation in the universe .",
    "combined with the fact that gcs and field stars in brighter galaxies have higher metallicities , a picture emerges in which the formation and accompanying metal enrichment of both gcs and halo stars seem to have started earlier and proceeded more rapidly and efficiently in massive galaxies , presumably in denser environments .",
    "it is also important to note that some galaxies have substructure in their stellar mdfs and are thus more complex than a smooth transition from a metal - rich dominance to metal - poor with increasing radius .",
    "examples include the milky way @xcite and m31 @xcite .",
    "the stellar mdf of the elliptical galaxy ngc 3379 ( figure 5@xmath12 ) also shows a fine substructure @xcite .",
    "the remote outer haloes of these galaxies are inhomogeneous in terms of surface density and show different metallicity distributions from the inner haloes .",
    "this indicates that the stellar populations in the outer haloes of galaxies are not well mixed , and in turn supports the build up of halo formation via satellite accretion @xcite , which can have mixing time scales of a few gyr in these outer regions @xcite .",
    "the evidence of the satellite accretion indicates that the outskirts of galaxies do not all build up their stellar populations in one single way .",
    "for instance , the ngc 3379 observation fits into a model in which its outskirts were formed by a combination of earlier dissipative mergers and later accretion of dwarf satellites .",
    "the remote halo of ngc 3379 has been on the fringes of active , violent gas - rich mergers at the early epochs of galaxy formation , and later experienced dry accretion of stars and gcs from its metal - poor satellite dwarfs .",
    "therefore , one should not assume that the stellar mdfs are unimodal at _ all _ positions , and our new interpretation would be more applicable to the inner , main bodies of galaxies than their remote outskirts .",

    "<S> one of the conundrums in extragalactic astronomy is the discrepancy in observed metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) between the two prime stellar components of early - type galaxies  globular clusters ( gcs ) and halo field stars . </S>",
    "<S> this is generally taken as evidence of highly decoupled evolutionary histories between gc systems and their parent galaxies . here </S>",
    "<S> we show , however , that new developments in linking the observed gc colors to their intrinsic metallicities suggest nonlinear color - to - metallicity conversions , which translate observed color distributions into strongly - peaked , unimodal mdfs with broad metal - poor tails . remarkably , the inferred gc mdfs are similar to the mdfs of resolved field stars in nearby elliptical galaxies and those produced by chemical evolution models of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the gc mdf shape , characterized by a sharp peak with a metal - poor tail , indicates a virtually continuous chemical enrichment with a relatively short timescale . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic shape emerges across three orders of magnitude in the host galaxy mass , suggesting a universal process of chemical enrichment among various gc systems . given that gcs are bluer than field stars within the same galaxy , it is plausible that the chemical enrichment processes of gcs ceased somewhat earlier than that of field stellar population , and if so , gcs preferentially trace the major , vigorous mode of star formation events in galactic formation . </S>",
    "<S> we further suggest a possible systematic age difference among gc systems , in that the gc systems in more luminous galaxies are older . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the downsizing paradigm whereby stars of brighter galaxies , on average , formed earlier than those of dimmer galaxies ; this additionally supports the similar nature shared by gcs and field stars . </S>",
    "<S> although the sample used in this study ( the _ hst _ acs / wfc , wfpc2 , and wfc3 photometry for the gc systems in the virgo galaxy cluster ) confines our discussion to @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 for giant ellipticals and @xmath1 10 @xmath2 for normal ellipticals , our findings suggest that gc systems and their parent galaxies have shared a more common origin than previously thought , and hence greatly simplify theories of galaxy formation . </S>"
