    "the absence of gravitational degrees in lower dimensions stipulates addition of physical sources in order to make strong attraction centers and black holes . the prototype example in this regard",
    "was provided by the baados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) black hole in @xmath0dimensions which was sourced by a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "addition of different sources to make alternative black holes to the btz has always been challenging 3,4,5 . from this token",
    "recently we considered a doublet of scalar fields constrained to lie on the unit sphere as source in @xmath0dimensions @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness condition of the scalar fields under rotation imposes an integer parameter to play role in the metric .",
    "two distinct classes of solutions emerged : a black hole with integer valued negative hawking temperature and a non - black hole metric with interesting topological properties .",
    "although extension of similar properties to @xmath1dimensional metrics remains to be seen it is of utmost importance in connection with the belief that spacetime may be digital. at the quantum ( planck ) level the idea is not new but at the classical , large scale it needs concrete proof to incorporate topological numbers . beside black holes wormholes",
    "also can be considered within the similar context . in a recent work we have shown for instance that a wormhole solution can also be obtained by employing a scalar - doublet of fields as source in @xmath0dimensions @xcite .",
    "let s add that multiple field scalar - tensor has been studied before 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 .",
    "triplet scalar field in the context of global monopole has been studied extensively in literature 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29 .",
    "one has to keep in order that the single scalar field coupled with gravity has been studied more rigorously .",
    "as our concentration is on @xmath0 and @xmath1 dimensions , we only refer to 30,31 in @xmath0 and @xcite in @xmath1dimensions .    in the present study",
    "we choose firstly our source again as a doublet of scalar fields , namely @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the modulus @xmath4 our metric is circularly symmetric so that the angular dependence washes out leaving only the radial dependent function @xmath4 in addition to the kinetic term of the scalar field we choose a suitable potential term such that our system will admit a black hole solution with interesting properties .",
    "the chosen potential with @xmath5 is the product of a polynomial expression with a liouville term .",
    "the number of parameters initially is four but with the solution the number reduces to two .",
    "the potential admits a local minimum apt to define a vacuum in the assumed field theory model .",
    "particle states can be constructed in the potential well in analogy with the energy levels of atoms .",
    "the potential has the constant term with @xmath6 , which leads to the well - known btz black hole .",
    "our solution can be interpreted as a new black hole solution constructed from a simple doublet of scalar fields .",
    "such black holes emerge with distinct properties when compared with a singlet scalar field black holes .",
    "secondly , we undertake the similar task to construct black holes in @xmath7dimensions whose source consists of a triplet of scalar fields .",
    "the solution in the limit of zero scalar fields naturally reduces to the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime .",

    "we should also admit that considering a relation between @xmath23 and the scalar field in the form given in ( 18 ) imposes restriction to our general solution . as we stressed before ,",

    "the only parameter that can be changed to shift the horizon into the region with positive specific heat is the mass of the black hole i.e. , @xmath121 therefore increasing @xmath94 causes the horizon to be larger and consequently  one obtains a positive @xmath104 and a stable black hole .      for an analytical comparison between the doublet scalar field and the singlet scalar field one needs to consider in ( 1)@xmath122",
