    "it is a fundamental result of quantum measurement theory that in any optomechanical system , where light serves as a quantum readout agent interacting with a mechanical probe ( test mass ) via radiation pressure , the probe is subject to measurement _ back - action _ @xcite . already in the simplest setup comprised of a mirror in `` free - space '' , see fig.[pic_om_setups]_a _ , quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field exert _ back - action noise _ on the probe @xcite which causes the standard quantum limit ( sql ) of measurement precision @xcite .",
    "this can become relevant in setups where the optical field is resonantly enhanced , as in a fabry - perot ( fp ) cavity , see fig.[pic_om_setups]_d_. in this way back - action noise has been observed very recently both directly @xcite and indirectly via ponderomotive squeezing @xcite . in addition ,",
    "resonant field enhancement causes _ dynamic back - action _ : modulation of the intracavity field by the motion of the probe produces a ponderomotive force , which alters the dynamical properties of the probe , as was first recognized in @xcite .",
    "dynamic back - action comprises a shift of the probe s ( i ) intrinsic damping rate ( _ optical damping _ ) , and ( ii ) mechanical frequency ( _ optical spring _ ) .",
    "both effects have been studied and observed in fp cavities ( or equivalent systems ) in a regime of _ dispersive coupling _ ( motion of the probe modulates cavity resonance frequency ) , and utilized for , respectively , optical back - action cooling @xcite of micromechanical oscillators @xcite , and optical trapping of a gram scale mirror @xcite .        in this paper",
    "we address dynamic back - action in standard two - path interferometers , as e.g.  michelson or sagnac interferometers , cf .",
    "fig.[pic_om_setups ] .",
    "high - precision measurements commonly employ such interferometric topologies because a path differential measurement in a balanced interferometer significantly suppresses path common noise , such as laser noise .",
    "the prime example is the michelson topology of gravitational wave detectors ( gwds ) .",
    "state - of - the - art balanced interferometers utilize resonant field enhancement techniques , similar to fp cavities @xcite .",
    "for instance , an additional mirror positioned in the interferometer s input and/or output port , referred to as power - recycling ( pr ) and signal - recycling ( sr ) mirror respectively , provides amplification of the laser power and/or the signal field @xcite . just as in a fp cavity ,",
    "the resonant field amplification in recycled interferometers implies dynamic back - action on the test masses .",
    "so far , the associated optomechanical effects have been considered exclusively in interferometers perfectly tuned to a dark fringe ( vanishing mean power ) in the output port ( hence , dark port ) . the operation on _ or close to _",
    "dark port is in fact the generic working point as it provides the most sensitive signal transduction , see fig.[pic_om_setups]_c _ , and on top of this ensures that laser noise is rejected from the interferometer s output . on dark port",
    "the _ scaling law _",
    "@xcite provides a general framework for understanding optomechanics of interferometers : it states that the dynamical and noise properties of any interferometer with high - finesse signal mode and operated on dark port , are equivalent to the ones derived from the dispersive optomechanics of a fp cavity with corresponding effective linewidth , detuning and circulating optical power .",
    "here we show that the dynamic back - action in any sr interferometer operated _ off dark port _ exhibits rather surprising , anomalous features as compared to the canonical one in a fp cavity as derived within the scope of the scaling law .",
    "we show this for the concrete setups of ( i ) a michelson - sagnac interferometer ( msi ) with a semitransparent membrane @xcite , see fig.[pic_om_setups]_f _ , as relevant to the optomechanical experiments with micro- and nano - mechanical test masses , and ( ii ) a free - mass michelson interferometer ( mi ) , as relevant to gwds , see fig.[pic_om_setups]_e_. we emphasize that our logic applies immediately to other interferometric topologies . in particular , we found that optical damping in msi as a function of detuning acquires a non - zero value on cavity resonance and additional cooling / heating regions on either side of the resonance . in a mi optical spring and",
    "damping acquire intersecting regions of positive / negative values .",
    "this is of particular interest for free - mass gwds as the intricate frequency dependence of the optical spring has been studied ( within the scope of scaling law ) as a means for increasing the sensitivity via tailoring the dynamics of the test masses @xcite .    from the viewpoint of cavity optomechanics the anomalous",
    "dynamic back - action can be understood as being caused by the emergence of _ dissipative coupling _ ( motion of the test mass modulates the cavity linewidth ) @xcite and its interplay with the usual dispersive coupling .",
    "recently some of the authors showed that a specially tuned msi can indeed exhibit a pure dissipative coupling @xcite . here",
    "we show that the anomalies in dynamic back - action have to be expected generically for any sr interferometer operated off dark port , even when no simple description in terms of dispersive and dissipative coupling is possible .",
    "we derive the dynamic back - action in a sr msi ( which covers mi as a special case ) using a transfer matrix approach to the propagation of fields in frequency domain @xcite .",
    "details of calculations are presented in appendix [ sec_propag_fields ] .",
    "first we characterize the non - recycled msi as an effective mirror whose reflectance @xmath0 and transmittance @xmath1 depend on the position of the membrane @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being the imbalance of the interferometer arms @xcite : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the laser carrier wavenumber , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the amplitude reflectivity and transmissivity of the beamsplitter , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the amplitude reflectivity and transmissivity of the membrane .",
    "reflectance @xmath0 describes reflection of the input vacuum field from detector port , while @xmath10 describes reflection of the input laser field .",
    "the dark port condition for the interferometer is achieved when @xmath11 , which is satisfied for @xmath12 and odd @xmath13 in the case of a balanced beamsplitter , @xmath14 .",
    "insertion of the sr mirror ( srm ) of amplitude reflectivity @xmath15 and transmissivity @xmath16 effectively transforms an interferometer into a fp cavity whose second mirror is defined by the msi .",
    "inverse resonance factor of this effective cavity , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the effective cavity length ( total length between the srm and the membrane , see fig.[pic_om_setups]_f _ ) , describes modulation of cavity resonance frequency _ and _ linewidth by the motion of the membrane , featuring dispersive and dissipative couplings respectively @xcite .",
    "in particular , total detuning @xmath19 of laser carrier frequency @xmath20 from cavity resonance reads @xmath21 here @xmath22 is a fixed integer , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the detuning from cavity resonance @xmath25 at dark port , defined by the position of the srm , and @xmath26 is the detuning due to offset from dark port , defined by the position of the membrane , hence , describing the dispersive coupling in the effective cavity .",
    "similarly , total half - linewidth @xmath27 of the latter in the narrow - band approximation ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 accounts for the finite transmittances of the srm via @xmath30 , and of the msi operated off dark port via @xmath31 , the latter thus describing dissipative coupling in the effective cavity .",
    "we then compute the fields incident on the membrane and derive the corresponding radiation pressure force , which consists of ( i ) the radiation pressure noise , that is stochastic back - action due to vacuum fluctuations entering from laser and detector ports , and ( ii ) the ponderomotive force due to motion of the membrane @xmath32 .",
    "the unsymmetrized spectral density of back - action noise exhibits a mixture of lorentz- and fano - like resonances , the latter owned to the interference between input and intracavity laser fields , see refs.@xcite and appendix [ sec_stochastic_ba ] .",
    "the ponderomotive force @xmath33 , calculated in appendix [ sec_dynamic_ba ] , creates a dynamic back - action @xmath34 , comprised of the optical spring @xmath35 $ ] and optical damping @xmath36/\\omega$ ] , such that the corresponding shifts of the square of the mechanical frequency and mechanical damping rate are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , with @xmath39 being the membrane s ( effective ) mass .",
    "we present the formula for @xmath34 , which is rather complicated in the general case , using the following simplifying assumptions : ( i ) balanced beamsplitter , ( ii ) single optical mode with narrow linewidth , @xmath40 , and ( iii ) small displacements of the membrane from the position corresponding to dark fringe , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 . under these conditions , @xmath43 , @xmath44   alternates in the sequence of dark ports , starting with @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "note that both shifts in linewidth ( @xmath31 ) and detuning ( @xmath26 ) due to offset from dark fringe are _ quadratic _ in displacement . ] and the dynamic back - action reads @xmath47}{\\gamma^2+\\delta^2}\\\\      + \\frac{2i(\\gamma_\\mathrm{sr}\\delta_\\mathrm{m}+\\gamma_\\mathrm{m}\\delta_\\mathrm{sr})\\omega+\\delta_\\mathrm{m}\\omega^2}{\\gamma^2+\\delta^2}\\biggr\\ } ,      \\label{eq_dynamic_ba_gen_approx}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the input laser power . for @xmath49 ( on dark port )",
    "eq.([eq_dynamic_ba_gen_approx ] ) reduces to the canonical spring and damping of a simple fp cavity with pure dispersive coupling @xcite . these canonical @xmath50 and @xmath51 posses the following characteristic features : ( i ) both are antisymmetric with respect to @xmath19 and vanish at @xmath52 , ( ii ) @xmath51 as a function of @xmath19 crosses zero only once , being positive for @xmath53 and negative for @xmath54",
    " these regions are usually labeled as stable ( cooling ) and unstable ( heating ) , ( iii ) @xmath50 as a function of @xmath19 crosses zero once if @xmath55 ( case of free - mass gwd interferometers ) and ( iv ) three times otherwise ( case of micromechanical oscillators in the resolved sideband limit ) .",
    "these properties are illustrated in fig.[pic_ba]_a , b_.     and @xmath51 defined in eq.([eq_dynamic_ba_gen_approx ] ) for @xmath49 , normalized to their respective maximum values , for @xmath56 .",
    "( _ b _ ) same for @xmath57 .",
    "( _ c _ ) and ( _ d _ ) respectively show optical damping and spring in the signal - recycled msi detuned from dark port at @xmath58 by @xmath59 , with @xmath60 mw , @xmath61 nm , @xmath62 cm , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 khz . ]    off dark port for @xmath66 , features ( i )  ( iii ) break . in this sense",
    "we refer to the dynamic back - action in a msi operated off dark fringe as anomalous .",
    "in particular , both @xmath50 and @xmath51 become highly asymmetric and acquire non - zero values at @xmath52 , see fig.[pic_ba]_c_,_d _ , such that for a certain region of parameters @xmath67  this is _ cooling on cavity resonance_. also optical damping can cross zero several times , acquiring additional regions of stability / instability ( see inset in fig.[pic_ba]_c _ ) , thus allowing _ another regime of cooling / heating_. non - zero @xmath50 at @xmath52 implies a shift of the mechanical frequency on resonance , although for micromechanical oscillators it is mostly negligible compared to their intrinsic mechanical frequencies .",
    "the influence of the optical losses can be estimated by corresponding increase of @xmath68 .",
    "we note that at fixed mechanical frequency @xmath69 optical damping is proportional to the antisymmetric part of the unsymmetrized spectral density @xmath70 of back - action noise , @xmath71 , see @xcite .",
    "since in cavity optomechanics the transformation of the lorentzian profile of @xmath70 into the mixture of lorentz and fano ones is governed by the interplay between dispersive and dissipative couplings @xcite , one can argue that the same mechanism leads to the transformation of canonical dynamic back - action into the anomalous one .",
    "dynamic back - action corresponding to the pure dissipative coupling in a single - mode cavity optomechanics was considered in @xcite , where it was shown that although both optical spring and damping remain antisymmetric with respect to @xmath19 ( and vanish at @xmath52 ) , damping acquires additional regions of stability / instability on either side of the cavity resonance .",
    "an extreme case of a 100% reflective membrane in msi corresponds to a pure mi , i.e.  reproduces basic topology of the gwds .",
    "the coordinate @xmath72 of the mechanical degree of freedom refers then to the differential motion of the end - mirrors in the arms of the mi , see fig.[pic_om_setups]_e_. for a gwd being a free - mass interferometer , the effect of the optical spring is not negligible , since it transforms ( almost ) free test masses into mechanical oscillators with resonance frequencies lying in the gw observation band , where typically @xmath56 .",
    "thus , if a detuned interferometer is operated at dark fringe , eq.([eq_dynamic_ba_gen_approx ] ) for @xmath49 implies either @xmath73 , @xmath74 for @xmath54 , or @xmath75 , @xmath76 for @xmath53 .",
    "this means that for a single laser drive a set of canonical @xmath50 and @xmath51 is unstable in both cases .",
    "however , a mi also exhibits anomalous dynamic back - action if operated off dark port , violating features ( ii ) and ( iii ) of the canonical one : in the limit of a quasi free mass , @xmath77 , which is of particular interest for gwds , eq.([eq_dynamic_ba_gen_approx ] ) reduces to    @xmath78,\\label{eq_optical spring_anom}\\\\      \\gamma&=-\\frac{4\\omega_0p_\\mathrm{in}}{c\\mathcal{l}}\\,\\frac{\\gamma\\delta}{(\\gamma^2+\\delta^2)^2}\\ ,      \\left[1-\\frac{\\gamma_\\mathrm{m}}{\\gamma}\\,\\frac{3\\gamma^2-\\delta^2}{\\gamma^2+\\delta^2}\\right].\\label{eq_optical damping_anom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    both @xmath50 and @xmath51 vanish on resonance , and one can check using eq.([eq_dynamic_ba_gen_approx ] ) that this feature holds for any @xmath79 .",
    "terms in square brackets in eqs.([eq_optical spring_anom],[eq_optical damping_anom ] ) represent the deviations from canonical formulas . according to these terms ,",
    "the optical spring can have three zeroes at @xmath52 and @xmath80 , if @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , the optical damping can also cross zero three times at @xmath52 and @xmath82 , if @xmath83 .",
    "this sequence of transformations of the canonical @xmath50 and @xmath51 , shown in fig[pic_ba]_a _ , into the anomalous ones for the increasing value of @xmath31 is illustrated in fig.[pic_ba_michelson ] .",
    "since the 2nd - generation gwds will be utilizing the single - photodiode homodyne readout ( dc - readout ) , when the offset from dark port is created on purpose to transmit a small portion of mean power to the detection port , anomalous optical spring / damping may have an impact on the control of detectors in detuned regime ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "additionally , in realistic dual - recycled interferometers ( sr _ and _ pr ) anomalous optical spring should be expected at even smaller @xmath85 , since anomalies rise at @xmath86 , where @xmath87 stands for the power reflectivity of the pr mirror , compared to @xmath88 for pure sr topologies .     and @xmath51 in a michelson interferometer , defined by eqs.([eq_optical spring_anom],[eq_optical damping_anom ] ) , and normalized to their respective maximum values .",

    "( _ c _ ) @xmath93 or @xmath94 , and ( _ d _ ) @xmath95 or @xmath96 demonstrate the existence of stable optical spring ( @xmath73 and @xmath76 ) in a certain range of detunings for larger offsets from dark fringe . ]",
    "fig.[pic_ba_michelson]_c , d _ shows that for a large enough offset from dark fringe several intersecting regions of positive / negative @xmath50 and @xmath51 appear , such that for a certain range of negative detunings both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are positive , indicating a possible stable state .",
    "accurate analysis of stability in terms of routh - hurwitz criteria indeed reveals that there exists a region of parameters where the set of @xmath50 and @xmath51 makes a stable optical spring which can be utilized for the increase of the quantum - noise - limited sensitivity of gwd topologies , such as traditional detuned - sr topology and promising intracavity topologies of optical bars @xcite and optical levers @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the dynamic back - action in interferometers operated off dark port exhibits anomalous features as compared to the canonical one in dark - port - operated interferometers , and should be expected as a generic feature in optomechanical systems which exhibit a mixture of dispersive and dissipative couplings . in particular , in a sr msi with a translucent micromechanical membrane , cooling / heating of the latter becomes possible on resonance .",
    "additionally , as a generic feature of dissipatively coupled systems , cooling of the membrane to near quantum ground state outside the resolved sideband regime can be in principle achieved .",
    "we have demonstrated that the scaling law  being the cornerstone of characterization of the optomechanics of gwd topologies  is invalidated for interferometers operated off dark port .",
    "in particular , for a large enough offset from dark port in a mi , a stable optical spring , used for the reduction of quantum noise , becomes possible with a single laser carrier .",
    "the latter condition is important , because the canonical optical spring ( on dark port ) can only be stabilized with either additional feedback / control loops or second laser carrier @xcite , which is undesirable in the experiment .",
    "thus , the offset from dark fringe makes a useful additional degree of freedom in shaping of the optical spring , and , in principle , may help in converting the latter into the so - called _ optical inertia _ @xcite which allows broadband reduction of quantum noise .",
    "however , since a large offset from dark fringe will couple mean power and technical laser noise into the detector port , certain changes in the gwd topology will be required to make use of the stable single - carrier optical spring , such e.g.  switching to intrcavity topologies @xcite .",
    "the anomalous aspects of back - action introduced in this paper , which will be important to estimate the consequences for next - generation gwds , can be examined and studied on the basis of a micromechanical system .",
    "therefore , our findings represent an example of the fruitful interplay between cavity optomechanics of micromechanical oscillators and the optomechanics of `` macro - mechanical '' oscillators as relevant to the high - precision interferometers employed for gwd .",
