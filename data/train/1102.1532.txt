    "as is well known , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) and confinement are two fundamental features of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "nowadays it is generally believed that at high enough temperature and/or density strongly interacting matter will undergo a chiral symmetry restoring and deconfining phase transition ( for a recent review , see for example ref .",
    "the study of such phase transitions has become a field of great theoretical and experimental interest over past years because it will provide us a fundamental understanding of the basic theory including the origin of observed mass and the nature of the early universe .",
    "a central goal of relativistic heavy ion collision experiments is to explore the phase structure and investigate the chiral phase transition of qcd matter .    in the study of chiral phase transition the enhanced quark number fluctuations",
    "are thought to be an essential characteristic @xcite . in the confined / chirally broken phase quark ( baryon )",
    "numbers are associated with hadrons in integer units whereas in the deconfined / chirally restored phase they are associated with quarks in fractional units which could lead to different quark number fluctuations in the two phases .",
    "theoretically such fluctuation is constructed from measurement of quark number susceptibility ( qns ) as a function of temperature , which is the the response of quark number density to infinitesimal change of chemical potential at zero chemical potential @xcite . in particular , it was recently argued that the qns may be used to identify the chiral critical point in the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "hence the qns of qcd has been extensively studied over the past twenty years using different approaches including lattice qcd simulations @xcite , nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite , hard - thermal / dense - loop resummation techniques @xcite and the rainbow - ladder approximation of the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) approach @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that many model calculations of the qns are done at the level of mean field approximation ( it corresponds to the rainbow - ladder approximation in the framework of the dses approach ) @xcite .",
    "since the qns is a very important quantity in characterizing the chiral phase transition , theoretically it is very interesting to calculate this quantity beyond mean field approximation , i.e , beyond the rainbow - ladder approximation of the dses approach .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to calculate the qns at finite temperature beyond the rainbow - ladder approximation of the dses approach .    over the past few years considerable",
    "progress has been made in the framework of the rainbow - ladder approximation of the dses approach @xcite ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . due to the great success of the rainbow - ladder approximation ( rl ) of the dses approach in hadron physics , the authors in refs . @xcite",
    "adopt this approximation to solve dses for the dressed quark propagator and the vector vertex and from these obtain the numerical value of the qns .",
    "however , it is well known that the rainbow - ladder approximation uses a bare quark - gluon vertex , which violates slavnov - taylor identity of qcd . in order to overcome this deficiency",
    ", physicists are trying their best to go beyond the rainbow - ladder approximation .",
    "much work has been done in this direction , including the ball - chiu ( bc ) vertex derived from the vector ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) @xcite , the cp vertex @xcite which takes into account some transverse effects and the vertex derived from the transverse wti @xcite . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , if the ghost amplitudes and the gluon dressing function factor are ignored in slavnov - taylor identity one would find the resultant relation has the form of a color matrix times the wti structure which could be satisfied by the bc vertex ansatz multiplied by the color matrix .",
    "therefore , in this paper we adopt such a quark - gluon vertex ansatz to explore the effect of vertex dressing on the quark number susceptibility .    when the bc vertex is used to calculate the dressed quark propagator from the dses",
    ", one should construct a consistent kernel approximation corresponding to this vertex . how to construct systematic and convergent expansions for the kernels of dses",
    "is a long - standing unsolved problem .",
    "recently , an important progress in this aspect has been achieved in ref .",
    "the authors in ref . @xcite have proposed a bethe - salpeter kernel which is valid for a general quark - gluon vertex and this provides a theoretical foundation for calculating the qns beyond the rainbow - ladder approximation . in the present paper we will use this method to calculate the qns at finite temperature .",
    "to make this paper self - contained , let us first recall the definition of the qns which is analogous to the familiar magnetic susceptibility .",
    "if we confine ourselves to the two - flavor case with exact isospin symmetry and set @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the chemical potential of the up and down quarks ) , the quark number density and the corresponding susceptibility are given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , where @xmath5 is the partition function of qcd at finite temperature @xmath6 and quark chemical potential @xmath7 .    from eq .",

    "it should be noted that in contrast to the chiral susceptibility @xcite , there is no ultraviolet divergence in the quark number susceptibility , and if one substitutes the free quark propagator ( in the chiral limit ) at finite @xmath6 and the bare vertex into eq .",

    "however , at present it is very difficult to calculate the dressed quark propagator and vector vertex from first principles of qcd and hence one has to resort to various nonperturbative qcd models . in the following we will use dses of qcd to calculate the qns from eq .",

    "<S> in this paper we calculate the quark number susceptibility ( qns ) of qcd at finite temperature under the rainbow - ladder and ball - chiu type truncation schemes of the dyson - schwinger approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the difference between the result of the rainbow - ladder truncation and that of ball - chiu type truncation is small , which shows that the dressing effect of the quark - gluon vertex on the qns at finite temperature is small . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that at low temperature the quark number susceptibility is nearly zero and it increases sharply when the temperature approaches the chiral phase transition point . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between the result in the present paper with those in the literature is made .    </S>",
