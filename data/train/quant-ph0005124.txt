    "ii we consider a number of proposals for standard forms of three - qubit pure states , concentrating especially on those which generalize some aspect of the bipartite schmidt decomposition : the _ minimal _ form @xcite , the _ two - term _ form @xcite , and the _ schmidt _ form .",
    "this form was given briefly in @xcite and independently in @xcite . in section iii",
    "we examine it in greater detail .",
    "we give an explicit parametrization of the coefficients in terms of five locally invariant quantities , and discuss their physical significance .",
    "we make use of the schmidt form to prove analytically the reliability of a proposed distillation technique for ghz triplets from general three - qubit pure states @xcite ; we present this proof in section iv .    in @xcite linden and popescu proposed characterizing the entanglement properties of three - qubit states by examining the `` orbits '' of the states under general local unitary transformation .",
    "this was carried a step further by carteret and sudbery @xcite , who proved that most states have a certain generic behavior under such transformations , but identified classes of ` special ' states which they speculated to have unusual entanglement properties . in section",
    "v we briefly review these ` special ' states , then analytically evaluate the yield of ghzs under the distillation protocol of @xcite and section iv . by examining the yield of these states as a function of the invariant parameters from section iii , and also of the locally invariant `` residual tangle '' @xmath7 of coffman , kundu and wootters @xcite , we verify that these classes of states are indeed exceptional by this operational measure , representing extremes of distillability or undistillability .",
    "we briefly compare the results using this protocol to the recently discovered optimal distillation method of @xcite , and find that they are entirely consistent .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section vi .",
    "two qubits can always be represented in their schmidt decomposition ( [ schmidt_decomp ] ) @xmath8 characterized by a single schmidt coefficient @xmath9 ( or equivalently @xmath10 ) . without loss of generality",
    ", we adopt the convention that @xmath11 and the corresponding eigenvector is @xmath12 .    most attempts to define a standard form for a _",
    "three_-qubit state attempt either to generalize some property of the bipartite schmidt decomposition , or make use of the schmidt decomposition between one of the bits and the other two , or both .",
    "for instance , we can make a schmidt decomposition between qubit a and qubits b and c , writing the three - qubit state in the form @xmath13 choosing the schmidt basis for qubit a guarantees that the correlated states of qubits b and c must be orthogonal : @xmath14    the sixteen real parameters to describe a generic pure state of three qubits can be reduced to fifteen by normalization , and to five which are invariant under the ten - dimensional group of local unitary transformations @xcite ; unfortunately , no single choice of five quantities has proven completely satisfactory .",
    "one simple parametrization that has been proposed @xcite is the linden - popescu - schlienz ( lps ) standard form .",
    "one begins with a state in form ( [ partial_schmidt ] ) .",
    "one can then choose one of the two correlated states , say @xmath15 , and find its corresponding schmidt bases .",
    "the resulting state for the three qubits has the form @xmath16 where @xmath9 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are real positive numbers , @xmath19 is complex , and @xmath20 .",
    "together these give five independent real parameters .",
    "the vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 span a two - dimensional subspace of the hilbert space for qubits 2 and 3 .",
    "it s possible to make an interesting variation on the lps idea using a result of niu and griffiths , who showed @xcite that any such two - dimensional subspace can be given basis vectors of the form @xmath23 for some choice of a product basis for the 4-d hilbert space of the two bits , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are real numbers between 0 and 1 . using this basis leads to a unique standard form @xmath26 where @xmath17 is real and @xmath27",
    "this then gives five independent real parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath17 , and the phase of @xmath28 .",
    "this form treats the @xmath12 and @xmath29 terms more symmetrically than lps ; however , there is still a lack of symmetry under interchange of the bits .",
    "more interesting from a fundamental point of view are attempts to generalize some aspect of the schmidt decomposition .",
    "three such properties suggest themselves .",
    "first , the schmidt decomposition is the choice of orthonormal bases for the local hilbert spaces which minimizes the number of terms needed to represent the state .",
    "second , any two qubit state can be written as the sum of only two product vectors .",
    "( for @xmath30-dimensional systems , @xmath30 product vectors are needed . )",
    "third , the schmidt decomposition diagonalizes the reduced density matrices of the local subsystems .",
    "no single representation for tripartite systems has all three properties , but they can be generalized individually .",
    "acn et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that all three - qubit states can be written in the form @xmath31 by a suitable choice of basis , where the @xmath32 are all real and positive and @xmath33 is a phase between @xmath34 and @xmath35 . with only five terms , this is a minimal description , and in that sense a generalization of the bipartite schmidt decomposition . a similar form has been described by higuchi and sudbery @xcite , @xmath36 which has the added benefit of being symmetric under interchange of the qubits .",
    "carteret , higuchi and sudbery @xcite have shown how to generalize this construction to give a unique minimal representation for systems of any dimension .",
    "these minimal forms have practical benefits : with a small number of terms , they can simplify the calculation of locally invariant quantities @xcite . however , the @xmath32 and @xmath33 themselves have no obvious physical interpretation",
    ".    this minimal property can be generalized in another way , by relaxing the requirement that the product vectors be orthogonal .",
    "acn et al . and dr , vidal and cirac",
    "have also shown @xcite that almost all three qubit states can be written in the form @xmath37 where the vectors are normalized but not orthogonal .",
    "there are six real parameters , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath33 ; imposing normalization reduces this to five .",
    "interestingly , not all three qubit states can be written in the form ( [ two_term ] ) ; a small subclass of states require a minimum of three product terms @xcite .",
    "dr , vidal and cirac made use of this result to prove that there are two classes of three - qubit pure states which can not be interconverted with nonzero probability @xcite .",
    "the class that requires three terms is a three - parameter family , and is characterized by vanishing residual tangle @xmath43 @xcite ( see section v ) .",
    "acn , dr and vidal also used this form to demonstrate a method of converting a single copy of a three qubit state into a ghz triplet with maximum probability @xcite .",
    "the third generalization is to find bases for all three qubits which diagonalize their reduced density matrices .",
    "that is , one can simultaneously put each bit in its schmidt decomposition with respect to the other two .",
    "this form was proposed in @xcite and independently in @xcite .",
    "the state has the form @xmath44 which looks just like a generic three - qubit state with 16 parameters . however , using each of the three qubits in turn we can write @xmath45 in a form similar to ( [ partial_schmidt ] ) , with orthogonality conditions which impose restrictions on the possible values of the coefficients in ( [ three_qubit ] ) .",
    "we can use these relationships to reduce these coefficients to five independent parameters , as we show in the next section .",
    "by redefining the relative phases of the basis vectors @xmath46 we can choose to make four of the coefficients real .",
    "a convenient choice is to make @xmath47 real , while @xmath48 remain complex .",
    "the state must also be normalized , which imposes the condition @xmath49 this leaves 11 undetermined parameters .",
    "we can now express the larger eigenvalues @xmath50 of the reduced density matrices @xmath51 in terms of the coefficients : @xmath52 ( the smaller eigenvalues obviously being @xmath53 ) . finally , the states @xmath54 correlated with basis vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 must be orthogonal to each other .",
    "this gives three more equations : @xmath57 because these equations are complex , they are equivalent to six real equations .    combining these restrictions",
    ", we now have fourteen equations in sixteen unknowns .",
    "thus , in addition to the eigenvalues @xmath50 we would expect there to be two more free parameters .",
    "can we identify reasonable candidates for these parameters ?",
    "it turns out that natural choices are the two probabilities @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "these parameters are symmetric under interchanges of the three qubits , and have a fairly simple physical interpretation : they are the probabilities of all three qubits giving the same result ( 0 or 1 , respectively ) when measured in their schmidt bases .",
    "moreover , the coefficients of the other state vectors can all be calculated in terms of the five probabilities @xmath60 , and @xmath50 , up to a sign .",
    "define @xmath61 .",
    "the expressions for the norms of the coefficients are then simple : @xmath62    the phases of @xmath63 are more complicated . if we define the variables @xmath64 by @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , the constraint equations ( [ orthogonality ] ) imply after a bit of algebra that @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are two constants .",
    "we can solve for the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 by using the identity @xmath71 and substituting ( [ norm_equations ] ) for @xmath72 .    in the schmidt form for three - qubit pure states ,",
    "each of the five parameters has a reasonably straightforward physical interpretation .",
    "the three parameters @xmath73 are the larger ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) eigenvalues of the reduced density operators for each of the three qubits , and correspond to the probabilities of obtaining the more likely of the two possible outcomes ( which by convention we label @xmath12 ) when we measure each of the qubits in its schmidt basis .",
    "these parameters are closely related to the minimum absolutely selective information @xcite for each qubit , which is given by the entropy function @xmath75 this quantity is the minimum amount of _ fundamentally unpredictable _ classical information generated by carrying out a measurement on qubit @xmath76 , given a free choice of measurement basis @xcite . by using the schmidt form to choose measurement bases we can simultaneously minimize the absolutely selective information for all three qubits .    the parameters @xmath73 range from @xmath77 to @xmath78 ( since they are defined to be the _",
    "larger _ eigenvalues of their corresponding local density matrices ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath58 ranges from @xmath34 to @xmath78 , and @xmath59 from @xmath34 to @xmath77 .",
    "however , this does not mean that these parameters can take arbitrary values within these ranges .",
    "some choices of parameter values correspond to no physical state , and give nonsensical values for ( [ norm_equations ] ) and ( [ phase_equations ] ) .",
    "in particular , the local probabilities must obey the triangle inequalities @xmath79 these imply , for instance , that if @xmath80 then @xmath81 .",
    "the restrictions on @xmath58 and @xmath59 are more complicated , but they too display an interdependency in their range of values",
    ". in particular , as @xmath82 we must have @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the schmidt form can provide analytical insight when addressing specific problems .",
    "for example , the efficacy of a recently proposed tripartite distillation protocol @xcite can be demonstrated with its help .",
    "consider a state of three qubits in an arbitrary product basis , which can be written in the form ( [ three_qubit ] ) .",
    "we can straightforwardly calculate the quantity @xmath85 @xmath86 this expression is a polynomial in the coefficients and their complex conjugates , and is correct in any basis .",
    "if the state is in the schmidt form , this simplifies to @xmath87    let us assume that we have written the state in schmidt form , such that the states @xmath88 for each qubit @xmath89 are eigenstates of the local density matrix with eigenvalues @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "suppose we now perform a weak measurement on each of the three qubits .",
    "first , allow each qubit to interact with a separate ancilla bit initially in state @xmath12 , such that @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "then measure the three ancilla bits . with a probability of @xmath94",
    "one will find one or more of the ancilla bits in state @xmath95 , in which case the procedure has failed .",
    "otherwise , this step has succeeded and the three qubits are now in a new state with slightly different coefficients @xmath96 .",
    "the changes in the coefficients are @xmath97 this very simple form results because the state is in schmidt form . after this procedure the bases for the three bits will generally no longer be the correct schmidt basis ( though it will be close to it ) , so the expression ( [ schmidt_p - p2 ] ) can not be used ; but ( [ p - p2 ] ) is always correct .",
    "thus we get a change in @xmath85 @xmath98 & = &    - \\epsilon ( 4 - 2(p_a+p_b+p_c ) ) ( |af - be|^2 + |ag - ce|^2 ) \\\\ & & - \\epsilon ( 3 - 2(p_a+p_b+p_c ) ) ( |ah - de|^2 + |bg - cf|^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\epsilon ( 2 - 2(p_a+p_b+p_c ) ) ( |bh - df|^2 + |ch - dg|^2 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & - \\epsilon ( 3 - 2(p_a+p_b+p_c ) ) p_a(1-p_a ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & - ( \\epsilon/2)(|af - be|^2 + |ag - ce|^2 - |bh - df|^2 - |ch - dg|^2 ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by making use of equations ( [ p_equation ] ) and ( [ orthogonality ] ) , this expression simplifies to @xmath98 & = &   \\epsilon \\biggl [ ( 2(p_a+p_b+p_c ) - 3 ) p_a(1-p_a ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + p_a ( a^2 - |e|^2 + |h|^2 - d^2 ) + d^2 - a^2 \\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which using ( [ norm_equations ] ) further simplifies to @xmath98 & = &   { { \\epsilon ( 2p_a-1)}\\over{2p_a+2p_b+2p_c-3 } } \\biggl [ 2(a^2+|h^2|)(p_b+p_c-1 )    \\nonumber\\\\ & & - ( 2p_a-1)(p_a+p_b+p_c-1)(p_a+p_b+p_c-2 )   \\biggr ] .",
    "\\label{deltap - p2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the prefactor to ( [ deltap - p2 ] ) is strictly positive , as is the first term inside the brackets .",
    "the second term is positive if @xmath99 ; any state that satisfies this criterion will evolve towards the ghz state and have a nonzero yield .    for @xmath100 , the sign of ( [ deltap - p2 ] ) depends on the relative sizes of the first and second terms inside the brackets .",
    "the last two equations of ( [ norm_equations ] ) show that for @xmath100 , the fact that @xmath101 implies @xmath102 which yields the inequalities @xmath103 this straightforwardly implies @xmath104 \\ge    \\epsilon ( 2p_a-1)(1-p_a)(p_a+p_b+p_c-2 ) \\ge 0.\\ ] ] because of the symmetry of the protocol , @xmath105 and @xmath106 must also increase .",
    "so one step of this protocol must move the state towards the ghz with nonvanishing probability , and will ( in general ) produce a nonzero yield of ghz triplets .",
    "there are three circumstances in which this result can fail .",
    "first , no product state can ever be distilled to a ghz by this method .",
    "at least one of @xmath73 must equal 1 in this case , which causes the rate ( [ deltap - p2 ] ) corresponding to it to vanish .",
    "this is not immediately obvious from the form of ( [ deltap - p2 ] ) , but it is easily checked using ( [ norm_equations ] ) and ( [ triangle])if @xmath80 , then @xmath107 , and ( [ deltap - p2 ] ) is equal to zero .",
    "second , there are states with @xmath108 for which @xmath109 , again making ( [ deltap - p2 ] ) vanish .",
    "these are a subset of the _ triple states _ discussed in section v below , which are equivalent to states of the form ( [ triple ] ) ; these states have vanishing residual tangle . finally , it is possible for a state with @xmath110 to evolve to one of these triple states .",
    "all such states will also have vanishing residual tangle @xcite , and conversely all states with vanishing residual tangle will evolve under this distillation protocol to a triple state with @xmath108 , and hence have zero yield of ghzs . this can be clearly seen in fig .  1 .",
    "linden and popescu @xcite proposed characterizing three - qubit states by the dimensions of their orbits under the action of the local unitary group .",
    "generically , tripartite pure states of qubits have ten - dimensional orbits , equal to the dimension of the local unitary group .",
    "the very interesting results of carteret and sudbery @xcite give a complete classification of all states for three qubits which behave nongenerically under local unitary transformations ; these ` special ' states have stabilizers of nonzero dimension , and hence orbits of dimension @xmath111 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior suggests that these ` special ' classes have unusual entanglement properties , which might be evident in other measures of entanglement .",
    "we have numerically simulated the distillation of generic states by the algorithm described above in section iv , in order to determine the yield of ghz triplets as a function of various parameters , especially the parameters used to describe the schmidt form .",
    "we have also calculated analytical expressions for the yield of states in the exceptional classes enumerated by carteret and sudbery .",
    "we find that these states are indeed exceptional by this operational criterion , as we describe below .",
    "most important in calculating the yield of ghzs is the sum of the local eigenvalues @xmath112 .",
    "this quantity determines the probability of failure in one step of the infinitesimal distillation procedure of section iv , with the probability of failure being @xmath113 .",
    "if it takes @xmath30 steps to become sufficiently close to a ghz triplet , the expected yield is @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the value of @xmath116 at the @xmath117th step . in the limit of infinitesimal steps",
    "the sum inside the exponent becomes an integral .",
    "calculating @xmath115 analytically is no simple matter for a general state ; the equations ( [ delta_coeff ] ) for the change in the coefficients become differential equations in the limit , but must be supplemented by an additional change of basis between steps , since in general the bases will no longer be the schmidt basis for the new state . while this is simple to do numerically , analytically it is challenging .    fortunately , the classes of exceptional states are generally expressible in simple forms which make it possible to integrate the equations ( [ delta_coeff ] ) in closed form , and derive simple expressions for the yield of ghzs .",
    "interestingly , the steps of the ghz distillation technique commute with local unitary transformations .",
    "because of this , the distillation procedure preserves the stabilizer of the initial state , and hence must take ` special ' states to other ` special ' states of the same type .",
    "this gives another way of understanding why certain special states are not distillable to ghzs .",
    "in addition to @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath116 , we looked at the dependence of the ghz yield on one other locally invariant quantity .",
    "this is the _ residual tangle _ of coffman et al .",
    "@xcite , which can be written @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the ( positive ) eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath121 . here",
    "@xmath122 is the density operator for the two - party @xmath123 system , and @xmath124 is the `` spin - flipped '' density operator : @xmath125 . it has been suggested @xcite that the residual tangle is a measure of the irreducible three - way ( `` ghz - type '' ) entanglement of a tripartite state , beyond any two - party ( `` epr - type '' ) entanglement that may be contained in such a state . as such , it is of particular interest in discussing distillability below . also , its square @xmath126 is a polynomial quantity , which makes it analytically tractable .",
    "_ triple states .",
    "_ for this set of states the residual tangle vanishes @xcite .",
    "we previously described states in this set as `` triple '' states @xcite , because they are equivalent under local unitary transformations to states with just three components : @xmath127 carteret and sudbery @xcite refer to these as `` beechnut '' states ; they all have @xmath128 . for triple states with @xmath129",
    "each step of the infinitesimal distillation protocol reduces @xmath116 , but leaves the state a triple state . if @xmath130 , the actions on the three qubits cancel out , leaving the state unchanged .",
    "states of this type have vanishing primary yield for the tripartite distillation protocols described in section iv and in @xcite ; indeed , dr , vidal and cirac have shown that _ no _ procedure can transform one copy of a state with zero residual tangle into a ghz with nonzero probability @xcite .",
    "because the distillation procedures of section iv and @xcite preserve the classes of ` special ' states , it is easy to see why they can not produce ghzs from triple states ; because all triple states have @xmath128 , they can not include the ghz state ( @xmath131 ) as a limit .",
    "the set of product states ( or `` bystander states '' in the terminology of carteret and sudbery ) is similarly undistillable .",
    "the result of dr , vidal and cirac , however , goes beyond this , since it assumes nothing about the symmetry of the procedure .    the symmetric version of state ( [ triple ] ) ( with @xmath132 )",
    "is termed by dr , vidal and cirac the `` w '' state , and seems to fill a role for the zero residual tangle states similar to the role filled by the ghz for all other states : it is , in some sense , maximally entangled .",

    "slice states written in the form ( [ slice ] ) are simultaneously in both schmidt and lps standard forms .",
    "it is easiest to see how the the distillability of these states compares to that of generic states by plotting their yields @xmath164 as a function of @xmath116 and @xmath7 along with the numerical results for a large sample of randomly generated states .",
    "we have plotted these quantities in figs .  1 and 2",
    ", with the families of ` special ' states indicated .",
    "we see that most of these states are indeed special as far as distillation is concerned : they form the boundaries of the plotted regions .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 does seem to be closely related to distillability , as conjectured , though this relationship is not exact ; for a given value of @xmath7 states with a range of @xmath164 values exist , but the range is not very wide .",
    "this range is bounded at the top by the generalized ghz and maximal slice states , and at the bottom by the symmetric generalized triple state .",
    "all zrt states have @xmath165 .",
    "there is also a relationship between @xmath116 and @xmath164 , though again for a given @xmath116 there is a range of @xmath164 values .",
    "this range too is bounded above by the generalized ghzs , and below by the zrt states , generalized triples and maximal slice states .",
    "these upper and lower bounds are both linear ; the upper bound is exactly the same as that for bernstein and bennett s procrustean technique @xcite , reflecting the fact that generalized ghz states can be distilled by exactly the same techniques which work in the bipartite case .",
    "a reasonable question is to what extent these yields are artifacts of the particular distillation protocol we use .",
    "after all , this technique is only one possible way of producing ghzs , in general not the optimal method even for a single copy of a three - qubit state .",
    "fortunately , we can actually answer this question . recently ,",
    "acn , jan , dr and vidal @xcite have discovered the optimal algorithm for transforming a single copy of a three - qubit state into a ghz .",
    "this involves performing a povm on each of the three bits , designed to project the states in the two - term representation onto tri - orthogonal vectors .",
    "finding the correct povm for an arbitrary state involves maximizing a somewhat involved function , but is easily done numerically .",
    "we have done so for a large sample of random states , as well as for the members of the ` special ' classes enumerated by carteret and sudbery .",
    "the optimal yield is higher , in general , than that of the infinitesimal algorithm of section iv , though they are surprisingly close for most states .",
    "however , for the ` special ' states , the yields are identical . in other words ,",
    "the infinitesimal distillation technique gives the optimal yield for these classes of states .",
    "quite remarkably , if we plot figures 1 and 2 for the optimal ghz distillation protocol , the figures look completely unchanged .",
    "thus we can see that by both the optimal and the infinitesimal techniques , these classes of special states extremize the yield of ghzs as a function of both @xmath7 and @xmath116 .",
    "this strongly supports the conclusion that these states do indeed have unusual entanglement properties , and are worthy of further study .",
    "we have examined tripartite entanglement from both an analytical and an operational point of view . in the bipartite case , which is well understood and to which we have turned for clues , the analytical and operational aspects of entanglement are closely related : the entanglement properties of a single copy are given by the locally invariant parameters , the schmidt coefficients , which also determine their operational characteristics .",
    "we have looked for similar connections in the three - qubit case . here",
    "at least five locally invariant parameters are required , as opposed to just one in the two - qubit case .",
    "we have examined several ways of choosing these five parameters , looking in particular at generalizations of the bipartite schmidt decomposition .",
    "one representation in particular , the `` schmidt form , '' has useful properties which made it simple to prove the efficacy of the infinitesimal ghz distillation protocol of @xcite ; it can also be parametrized in terms of five physically meaningful quantities .",
    "we have looked for connections between these parameters and yields in distilling ghz triplets , as well as connections with the residual tangle of coffman et al .",
    "we have shown that the ` special ' classes of states enumerated by the theorem of carteret and sudbery extremize the distillation yield as functions of the residual tangle @xmath7 and @xmath166 .",
    "although a certain amount amount of progress towards understanding tripartite entanglement has been made , at least for qubits , many important questions remain unanswered .",
    "for example , the number of states in the asymptotic minimum reversible entanglement generating set ( mregs ) @xcite for three - qubit states , and for tripartite states in general , is still unknown .",
    "no asymptotically reversible ( or optimal but irreversible ) distillation technique for ghz states is known .",
    "the search for solutions to these and related problems is ongoing .",
    "we would like to thank h.a .",
    "carteret , w. dr , r.b .",
    "griffiths , a. sudbery and g. vidal for many useful conversations .",
    "this work was supported by nsf grant no .",
    "phy-9900755 .",
    "figure 1 . here",
    "we plot the primary yield of ghz triplets from the infinitesimal distillation algorithm of section iii vs. the square of the residual tangle @xmath126 for various ` special states ' as well as a random sample of generic states .",
    "we see that all states lie between two curved boundaries ; the generalized ghz and maximal slice states lie on the upper boundary , while the generalized triple states lie on the lower boundary .",
    "the triple states all have both @xmath7 and the yield equal to zero .",
    "interestingly , the maximal slice states appear to be high - yield states when plotted against @xmath7 , but low - yield when plotted against @xmath167 ; for a given value of @xmath7 these states minimize @xmath168 .",
    "figure 2 . here",
    "we plot the primary yield of ghz triplets from the infinitesimal distillation algorithm of section iii vs. @xmath169 for various ` special states ' as well as a random sample of generic states .",
    "we see that all states lie between two linear boundaries ; the generalized ghz states lie on the upper boundary , while the maximal slice and generalized triple states lie on the lower boundary , and the triple states are the zero - yield states between @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "the upper linear boundary corresponds to the yield of bernstein and bennett s procrustean method of epr distillation in the bipartite case ."
