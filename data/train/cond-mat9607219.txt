    "the phase diagram of high temperature superconductors in the mixed state has provided an astonishingly broad field to workers in -among other fields- many body problems , polymer physics , low dimensional systems , critical phenomena , and statistical physics in general .",
    "the main reason of this situation is the great number of parameters that define the behavior of the vortex structure . on the other hand",
    ", the same abundance of parameters defining the system turns difficult to find a unified description of all features observed in experiments .",
    "some of the main parameters that define the behavior of the vortex structure are the external magnetic field @xmath4 , temperature @xmath5 , anisotropy @xmath6 , and the disorder ( which produces a non - homogeneous pinning potential for the vortices ) that at this moment we loosely characterize by a parameter @xmath7 .",
    "there are convincing explanations of the main characteristics of different sectors of this multi - dimensional phase diagram , such as the first order melting of the vortex - lattice in clean samples , the continuous melting of a glassy phase in disordered samples , or the existence of two different superconducting transitions ( perpendicular and parallel to @xmath4 ) in some cases ( for a review see ref",
    "however a unified , consistent with experiments description of the problem , even in a qualitative level , is still lacking .    in this paper",
    "we propose a qualitative @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath7-@xmath6 phase diagram of high-@xmath8s , that reproduces most of the available experimental results .",
    "our approach is twofold : we use numerical simulation on the three - dimensional josephson junction array model to study the behavior of the system as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath6 , and show that the dependence on @xmath4 can be deduced from a rescaling of @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "the obtained phase diagram is then rederived using a phenomenological estimation of the free energy @xmath9 of the system for different values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "this estimation relies on the existence of two characteristic lengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 parallel and perpendicular to the applied field @xmath4 which are supposed to govern the behavior of the system .",
    "the minimizing of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath10 and @xmath11 allows one to obtain the @xmath12 and @xmath13 functions , which in turn are used to detect the superconducting transitions .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the results of the numerical simulations , and discuss the @xmath7-@xmath6 phase diagram emerging from them . in sec .",
    "iii this phase diagram is qualitatively re - obtained using a proposal for the free energy of the system . in sec .",
    "iv we indicate that a change in the external magnetic field can be interpreted as a movements in the @xmath7-@xmath6 plane , and so the @xmath4-@xmath5 phase diagram for samples with different @xmath7 and @xmath6 can be obtained from the results of the previous sections .",
    "we also compare our results with those found in experimental studies . finally in sec .",
    "v , we summarize and conclude .",
    "our numerical results are based on simulations performed on the three dimensional ( 3d ) josephson junction array ( jja ) model on a stacked triangular network .",
    "each junction is modelled by an ideal josephson junction with critical current @xmath14 shunted by a normal resistance @xmath15 and its attached johnson noise generator , which accounts for the effects of temperature .",
    "an external _ c _ directed magnetic field is included .",
    "the variables that characterize the model are the phase of a superconducting order parameter defined on the nodes of the lattice .",
    "vortices form in the system as singularities in the distribution of these phases .",
    "the details of the model have been discussed elsewhere.@xcite the 3d jja model has been previously used to show the first order melting of the vortex lattice in clean systems.@xcite both thermodynamical and transport signatures of this first order transition were obtained , in close relation to experimental results.@xcite in addition , using the same model we have shown that disorder can destroy the first order transition.@xcite    we study here the model further by systematically exploring the case of anisotropic and disordered samples .",
    "we introduce anisotropy by reducing the critical current of the _ c _ axis directed junctions by a factor @xmath16 , and at the same time increasing the _ c _ axis normal resistance by the same factor .",
    "disorder is introduced by randomly varying the critical current of the junctions through the lattice . as vortices gain energy when close to a low critical current region , the effect of randomizing the critical currents is to provide a nearly random pinning potential for vortices .",
    "we characterize the disorder by a parameter @xmath7 which is defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the maximum and minimum value of the critical current of the junctions through the sample . the probability distribution between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is taken flat .",
    "we carried out simulations for @xmath20 flux quanta per plaquette .",
    "this is the value used in refs . 4 and 5 .",
    "it produces a ground state ( for a clean sample ) which is commensurate with the subjacent triangular lattice , so no frustration effects are expected .",
    "although the value @xmath21 is rather large and effects of the substrate may be observable , we expect the physics of the problem to be qualitatively well described .",
    "in particular , we assume that for a clean sample the first order melting observed in simulations is in fact the counterpart of the experimental observations.@xcite it would be interesting to perform simulations at lower ( commensurate ) fields , such as @xmath22 or @xmath23 . however , the sample size needed to minimize size effects make the computing time be exceedingly large .",
    "all simulations presented here were performed for @xmath20 , with boundary conditions as in ref .",
    "7 , and for a sample of @xmath24 junctions .",
    "we characterize the superconducting transitions by measuring the resistivity of the sample when a small current ( typically 1/100 of the mean critical current in the corresponding direction ) is applied along the _ ab _ or _ c _ direction .",
    "we will observe two well different behaviors of the resistivities as a function of temperature : in some cases resistivities have a jump from zero to a finite value at a given temperature .",
    "this jump in the resistivity corresponds ( see the discussions in sec .",
    "iv ) to a first order phase transition of the vortex lattice . in some other cases",
    "we will obtain that resistivities as a function of temperature smoothly depart from zero .",
    "we will refer to this behavior as a _",
    "continuous transition_. we do not claim at this point about whether these continuous transitions are or are not real phase transitions , they can be crossovers as well . in sec .",
    "v we present a discussion on this point .",
    "we start by showing in fig .",
    "[ uno](a ) and ( b ) ( full symbols ) the results for the _ ab _ plane and _ c _ axis resistivity of an isotropic sample as a function of temperature for different values of the disorder @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath25 we obtain a jump in the resistivities at a well defined temperature ( the low temperature tails in @xmath26 are due to surface effects ) .",
    "this temperature is the ( first order ) melting temperature @xmath27 of the system . at @xmath27 the superconducting coherence",
    "is lost discontinuously in all directions .",
    "in other words , vortices passes from a solid phase to an entangled liquid phase .",
    "this situation persists for low values of disorder .",
    "when disorder increases further ( @xmath28 in our simulations ) , the first order transition is lost , and two continuous transitions at different temperatures @xmath29 -for @xmath30- and @xmath31 -for @xmath32- are obtained .",
    "superconducting coherence along the _ ab _ plane is lost at @xmath29 when increasing the temperature , but the system is still superconducting along the _ c _ direction . at the higher temperature @xmath31 the parallel to field superconducting coherence",
    "for @xmath33 the vortex structure corresponds to that of a disentangled vortex liquid .",
    "= 8.7truecm    thermodynamical measurements agree with this picture .",
    "we calculated the helicity modulus parallel ( @xmath34 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath35 ) to the field .",
    "helicity modulus measures the influence on the energy of the system of a twist in the boundary conditions , and has to be different from zero to indicate superconducting coherence.@xcite open symbols in fig .",
    "[ uno](a ) and ( b ) show the values @xmath36 that correspond to the resistivity curves .",
    "in the case of the first order transition both @xmath37 and @xmath38 have an abrupt drop at the melting temperature . for the highly disordered case",
    "@xmath38 has a ( smoother ) decrease at @xmath29 , whereas @xmath34 becomes nearly zero at @xmath31 .",
    "the transition at @xmath31 is a percolation phase transition of the vortex structure as discussed in refs .",
    "14 and 12 , that can be characterized by a percolation probability @xmath39 the value of @xmath40 is the probability that a vortex path traversing the sample perpendicularly to the applied field exists .",
    "this value is zero below the transition and one above , with a transition zone that becomes narrower when @xmath41 increases .",
    "the plot of @xmath40 vs temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ uno](c ) .",
    "we see that @xmath32 is different from ( equal to ) zero if @xmath40 is different from ( equal to ) zero .",
    "= 8.7truecm    in fig . [ dos ]",
    "we give the corresponding results for anisotropy @xmath42 .",
    "the first order melting transition occurring for low disorder is similar to that observed for @xmath43 , i.e. , the inter - plane coherence is lost at the same temperature than the in - plane coherence .",
    "however , for higher values of disorder some differences occur : the inter - plane resistive transition occurs ( to our numerical precision ) at the same temperature as the in - plane transition @xmath29 , but the percolation transition temperature @xmath44 ( which for low anisotropy coincides with the resistive inter - plane transition ) occurs for lower temperatures , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "this indicates that for high anisotropy , there is a temperature range @xmath46 for which percolation paths across the samples exist , however these path are not mobile ( presumably because they are pinned to the planes , as @xmath47 ) and dissipation is not observed.@xcite    from the above discussion on figs .",
    "[ uno ] and [ dos ] , the following picture emerges : at low disorder the vortex lattice melts through a first order phase transition . when disorder increases this transition breaks into two continuous ones , where in - plane and inter - plane coherence are lost at different temperatures @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "whether @xmath29 is larger or lower than @xmath31 depends on the anisotropy of the system . for nearly isotropic samples @xmath29 is lower than @xmath31 , and a disentangled vortex liquid phase exists for @xmath33 . for highly anisotropic samples",
    "@xmath31 is lower than @xmath48 although dissipation along the _ c _ axis is observed only for @xmath49 .    in fig .",
    "[ tres ] we show the numerical @xmath7-@xmath6 phase diagram as obtained from simulations .",
    "stars indicate points where the melting transition is first order .",
    "full circles are points where @xmath50 , and hollow circles are points where @xmath45 .",
    "this diagram shows the three different zones discussed above . the continuous line is a sketch of the frontiers between the different zones . in the next section",
    "we show that the main characteristics of this phase diagram can be derived from a simplified description of the vortex structure .",
    "we saw in the previous section that a single first order transition is observed at low disorder , whereas two continuous ones are obtained in disordered samples .",
    "these features suggest that the system can be described as having in general two different transitions , but that in certain cases they can merge onto a single first order transition due to some kind of ` interaction ' . here",
    "we show that this idea can be formulated more precisely by estimating the free energy of the system .      to make this estimation we will consider first a single clean plane .",
    "we suppose that the thermodynamics of that plane can be phenomenologically described by a quantity @xmath11 , which is a correlation length : for distances shorter than @xmath11 the system has superconducting coherence , whereas this coherence is lost for distances larger than @xmath11 .",
    "the free energy functional @xmath51 of the plane has the form @xmath52 ( the thermodynamical free energy @xmath9 is obtained by minimizing with respect to @xmath11 ) . for a system of @xmath53 completely decoupled planes , we would have @xmath54 on the other hand , if the coupling between planes is infinite the vortices are rigid lines and we get @xmath55 note that in this case the entropy term does not have the factor @xmath53 because giving the position of the vortices on one plane automatically determines the position of vortices in all other planes .",
    "the term @xmath56 accounts for the energy gain due to the coupling of the planes , @xmath57 being a numerical constant and @xmath6 the anisotropy parameter defined before . in an intermediate situation ( @xmath58 )",
    "the system can be thought as formed by @xmath59 layers ( @xmath10 is a number that satisfies @xmath60 ) . within each layer",
    "the vortices are almost straight lines , whereas correlation is small between different layers . within this picture",
    "the free energy of the system is    @xmath61    in the first term , @xmath62 is the number of sites along the _ c_-direction at which the system gains an energy @xmath63 .",
    "the length @xmath10 is a correlation length along the _ c-_direction .",
    "for distances shorter than @xmath10 the system possesses superconducting coherence , whereas this coherence is lost at distances greater than @xmath10 .",
    "the previous estimation of the free energy of the system is too crude . in particular , in the form given by eq .",
    "( [ f4 ] ) , it leads to some unphysical results .",
    "we must modify eq .",
    "( [ f4 ] ) slightly in order to obtain the correct behavior in some limiting cases .",
    "however , we will keep a fundamental property of eq .",
    "( [ f4 ] ) and make the guess that the entropy can be written for the real system as @xmath64 i.e. , as a product of independent functions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 two yet unknown functions .",
    "the basic assumption contained in ( [ entropia ] ) is the following : if the value of @xmath10 is kept fixed , then the system behaves as a two dimensional system with a renormalized temperature .",
    "although this assumption can not be fully justified a priori , it is a natural starting point , and gives sensible results as we will show soon .",
    "we still have to add a term to the free energy which accounts for the effect of impurities .",
    "impurities decrease the energy of the system when vortices pin to them .",
    "if pinning is uncorrelated the energy gain due to pinning becomes lower when the vortex positions are more correlated .",
    "so we add a term to the free energy that increases the energy of the system when @xmath11 and @xmath10 increase .",
    "the most simple term of this type is of the form @xmath67 .",
    "finally , the free energy functional of the system @xmath68 ( dropping an irrelevant constant term ) is    @xmath69    the true expressions for the functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are difficult to establish .",
    "however , it is not our aim to give a complete quantitative description of the free energy of the system but only a qualitative description of the phase diagram .",
    "we will only ask the functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 to reproduce some known limiting cases : if @xmath73 ( @xmath11 ) is kept fix we expect the value of @xmath13 ( @xmath74 ) obtained by minimizing @xmath75 , to be smoothly dependent on temperature .",
    "this corresponds to the absence of first order transitions in the dynamics of a single plane ( a single vortex line).@xcite however , when @xmath75 is minimized with respect to _ both _ @xmath10 and @xmath76 a _  discontinuity _ in @xmath12 and @xmath13 can appear , as we show below .",
    "just to give an example we use for the function @xmath70 the form @xmath77 .",
    "the term @xmath78 ( @xmath79 is a numerical constant ) is proportional to the entropy of a single ( isolated ) vortex line .",
    "the constant added assures that the two - dimensional limiting case is reobtained when @xmath80 .",
    "in addition , we will take for the functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 the form @xmath81 and @xmath82 , in such a way that we obtain a form for the free energy functional that is ( unphysically ! ) symmetric ( for @xmath83 ) between _ ab_- and _ c_-directions .",
    "we have tested other forms of the functions @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( giving the same limiting behavior discussed above ) and found results qualitatively similar to those shown here .",
    "we arrive to our final working expression of the free energy functional ( we will measure @xmath11 and @xmath10 in units of @xmath41 and @xmath53 , respectively , take @xmath84 by rescaling @xmath85 and also rescale @xmath7 )    @xmath86 \\left [ \\gamma \\ln \\left ( 1/\\xi _ { ab}\\right ) + 1\\right ] + d\\xi _ { ab}\\xi _ c   \\label{f6}\\ ] ]    2    the thermodynamical free energy @xmath9 is obtained by minimizing with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath10 : @xmath87    we stress again we do not claim expression ( [ f6 ] ) is a good detailed description of the free energy of the system , but only a expression ( which main characteristic is given by eq .",
    "( [ entropia ] ) ) , that will help us to understand different sectors of the @xmath7-@xmath6 phase diagram of high-@xmath88 s .",
    "we present now the results obtained by minimizing the free energy functional given by expression ( [ f6 ] ) . when doing this minimization we obtain the free energy @xmath9 and the lengths @xmath11 and @xmath10 as a function of temperature .",
    "a first order transition is identified as a discontinuous derivative of @xmath9 , or equivalently a jump in the values of @xmath11 and @xmath89 .",
    "when no jump in @xmath11 and @xmath10 is obtained , the dependence of @xmath11 and @xmath10 with temperature gives a clue on how the superconducting coherence is lost when raising temperature .",
    "however , in this case the identification of a phase transition is not simple , and we can only identify temperature ranges where coherence along _",
    "ab-_directions is high or low .",
    "let us start with the case @xmath25 and @xmath43 ( note that we are using a renormalized anisotropy parameter , so @xmath43 does not imply necessarily an isotropic system ) . in this case eq . ( [ f6 ] ) is symmetric in @xmath76 and @xmath10 , and in fact",
    "the minima of @xmath75 are on the line @xmath90 , so in fig .",
    "[ cuatro ] we plot the function @xmath91 for different values of the temperature .",
    "we see that when @xmath92 the minimum free energy state corresponds to the maximum possible value of @xmath93 , i.e. , the system is in the ordered state . when temperature increases a _ first order _ transition to a disordered state occurs .",
    "this is also seen from the behavior of @xmath93 as a function of temperature , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ cuatro](b ) .",
    "thus we see that the coupling of two continuous transition ( through the entropy term in ( [ f6 ] ) ) can merge them onto a single one , which is first order .",
    "in fact , such sort of mechanism has been previously proposed to occur in other cases , such as two dimensional melting , in which the continuous dislocation - unbinding and disclination - unbinding transitions of the kosterlitsz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young melting theory@xcite can collapse onto a first order melting transition.@xcite    = 8.7truecm    if disorder is present in the system it will tend to destroy the melting transition . in fig .",
    "[ cinco ] we show results as those of fig .",
    "[ cuatro ] but for a value of @xmath94 . as we see",
    "the jumps in @xmath11 and @xmath10 have disappeared , indicating that the transition is not first order .",
    "if the anisotropy had been chosen different from one , then the temperature at which @xmath11 and @xmath10 take a given value would have been different .",
    "although we can not characterize from our simplified model a phase transition when @xmath11 and @xmath10 are continuous functions of temperature , it is tempting to say that if @xmath11 ( @xmath10 ) drops to zero at lower temperature than @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , then we are in a sector of the phase diagram where @xmath50 ( @xmath45 ) . in this way",
    "we generate the phase diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ seis ] . as indicated , it is qualitatively similar to the one obtained from the numerical simulation , and it gives support _  a posteriori _ to the proposal of an entropy of the system of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ entropia ] ) .",
    "some characteristics of this phase diagram can be analyzed in simple terms .",
    "for example , when @xmath95 the system is a set of decoupled planes , and no first order transition is obtained for any value of @xmath96 when @xmath97 vortices are rigid lines and in fact effectively two - dimensional , so a first order transition is not obtained in this case either .",
    "this limiting cases give some insight on the form of the border between first - order and continuous transitions in figs .",
    "[ tres ] and [ seis ] .",
    "there is an optimum value of the anisotropy , at which the first order transition persists up to a highest value of disorder .",
    "this optimum value depends on the thickness of the sample .",
    "in fact , as we discussed in a previous work@xcite the temperature @xmath31 logaritmically _ decreases _ when the thickness of the sample increases .",
    "this means that in fig .",
    "[ tres ] the border between the zones with @xmath98 and @xmath99 moves to lower values of @xmath6 .",
    "it is thus likely that the optimum value of @xmath6 for the occurrence of the first order transition also decreases with sample thickness .",
    "having discussed the @xmath7-@xmath6 phase diagram for a fixed magnetic field @xmath4 , we turn now to the discussion of the dependence on @xmath4 . from the numerical point of view",
    "the direct approach would be to do simulations at different fields .",
    "however , as we discussed above , to reduce the magnetic field to other commensurate values would require exceedingly large computing time . fortunately , there are arguments that suggest that a change of @xmath4 can be mapped onto a change of @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "= 8.7truecm    the scaling combination between magnetic field and anisotropy has been given by chen and teitel.@xcite we generalize here the argument to include the disorder parameter @xmath7 .",
    "our dimensionless temperature ( measured in units of the mean josephson energy of the in - plane junctions ) can be only a function of the other dimensionless parameters of the system .",
    "these are @xmath7 , @xmath4 , and @xmath6 .",
    "these parameters have different dependences on the coherence length @xmath100 .",
    "if we identify the discretization parameter in the _ ab _ plane with a distance of the order of the coherence length @xmath101 then the critical current of the josephson junctions along the _ c _ direction is proportional to @xmath102 so the anisotropy parameter @xmath6 behaves as @xmath103 on the other hand , our dimensionless magnetic field @xmath4 is given in terms of the real external magnetic field @xmath104 by the expression @xmath105 ( @xmath106 is the flux quantum ) . for the parameter @xmath7",
