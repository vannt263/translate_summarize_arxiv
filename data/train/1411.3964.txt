    "this paper describes a fast numerical algorithm for computing the configuration of lipid bilayer vesicles .",
    "lipid bilayers are crucial components to living systems . being amphiphilic ,",
    "lipid molecules have charged or polar hydrophilic head groups and hydrophobic tails .",
    "this allows lipids in aqueous solution to aggregate into structures that entropically favor the alignment of hydrophobic tails and the exposure of hydrophilic head groups to water .",
    "a lipid bilayer is formed from the self - assembly of hydrophobic tails of the two complementary layers .",
    "the bilayer will the then close so the hydrophobic core will not be exposed at the free edges , forming membranes of cells and sub - celluar organelles .",
    "these membranes are semi - permeable boundaries separating the enclosure from the surrounding environment . at the microscale ,",
    "lipid bilayer membranes regulate the transportation of ions , proteins and other molecules between separated domains , and provide a flexible platform on which molecules can aggregate to carry out vital chemical or physical reactions . at the mesoscale , for example , membranes of the red blood cells ( rbcs ) suspended in blood flow change their shape in response to the local flow conditions , and this change will in turn affect the rbc s ability of oxygen transport and the hydrodynamic properties of the blood flow @xcite .",
    "deformation of the bilayer membranes can be driven by various types of force . at the microscale ,",
    "driven forces are mainly the results of protein - membrane or membrane - membrane interactions , such as protein binding or insertion , lipid insertion or translation , and ubiquitous electrostatic interactions , to name a few @xcite . at the mesoscale",
    ", hydrodynamic forces usually dominate @xcite .",
    "determination of the membrane geometry in response to protein - membrane , membrane - membrane , or fluid - membrane interactions is necessary for elucidating the structure - function relation of these interacted biological systems .",
    "the variation of lipid bilayer configurations can be characterized by its deformation energy .",
    "this energy is the handle of almost all computational methods .",
    "classical strain energy can be defined for lipid bilayers so their deformation can be described as elastic plates @xcite .",
    "a crucial difference between the plates and bilayer membranes is missing in such models : a flat membrane can be subject to some shear deformation with zero energy cost provided the deformation is so slow that the viscous effect of lipids is negligible @xcite . as a result",
    ", the deformation energy of a lipid bilayer is mostly attributed to the bending energy of the monolayers .",
    "the classical energy forms proposed by canham @xcite , helfrich @xcite , and evans @xcite , are of this type , in which the deformation energy is defined be a quadratic function of the principle curvature of the surface .",
    "other components of the energy , such as those corresponding to the area expansion and contraction of the monolayers , and the osmotic pressure , are of several orders of magnitude larger than the bending energy , and usually serve in computational models as area and enclosed volume constraints of the bilayer membrane , respectively . with this simplification , often referred to as the spontaneous curvature model , the deformation energy of the bilayer membrane is given by the bending curvature equation with two constraints .",
    "the equilibrium configuration of lipid bilayer vesicles can be obtained by minimizing this energy .",
    "for sufficiently simplified membrane systems such as isolated vesicles with symmetric lipid composition , analytical analysis of these energies can give an excellent classification of the phases of the vesicle configurations , particularly the axisymmetric configurations , and can accurately locate the conditions under which the phase transition occurs @xcite . giving the complexity the realistic interacted biological system with which lipid bilayer is interacted , analytical approaches may fail in quantifying these interactions and thus computational methods become indispensable .",
    "the solutions of the energy minimization problem have been computed in various ways . solving the euler - lagrange equations",
    "directly has so far been restricted by the surface parameterization to solutions which are axisymmetric @xcite .",
    "one alternative is to minimize the energy over a smaller subspace of membrane configurations . on triangulated vesicle surface",
    ", the subspace can be that spanned by the basis functions at triangular vertices . in this subspace",
    "the deformation energy can be approximated using rayleigh - ritz procedure @xcite or finite element methods @xcite . in case that the triangular mesh needs to be locally refined to resolve a very large local curvature ,",
    "the number of basis functions becomes large , leading to a significant increase of computational cost of numerical minimization .",
    "the other alternative is to define the surface of a lipid bilayer vesicle as the level set of a phase field function .",
    "geometrical properties of the vesicle surface can be represented using the phase field function , and the equilibrium surface configuration can be obtained by following the gradient flow driven by the membrane curvature .",
    "approaches of this type have been very successful in describing the nonaxisymmetric equilibrium configurations @xcite , membranes with multiple lipid species @xcite , membranes with surfactant sedimentation or solvation @xcite , and membrane - flow interactions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the phase field approach is the only computational method that can simulate topological changes of the surface during the merging or separation of vesicles .",
    "nevertheless , there is a significant increase in the computational cost with phase field approaches , because the tracking of the 2-d vesicle surface is replaced by the evolution of 3-d phase field function .",
    "special numerical techniques , such as spectral methods @xcite , finite difference or finite element methods with local mesh refinement @xcite , have been developed to accelerate the simulations .",
    "there are many important applications where fast algorithms are necessary for simulating vesicle deformation that does not necessarily involve topological change .",
    "these include the vesicle deformations induced by protein clusters @xcite , and interactions between blood flow in micro - vessels and the deformable rbcs @xcite .",
    "for example , about 7778 nodes are used to describe the deformation of spherical vesicles in 3-d simulations of single vesicle - blood flow interactions using immersed boundary method @xcite . in a 2-d simulation of multiple vesicle - blood flow interactions ,",
    "about 128 to 512 nodes are used to track the deformation of a single vesicle at a satisfactory resolution @xcite .",
    "a full 3-d simulation of this type can be even more expensive .",
    "an accurate and simplified representation of vesicle configuration will greatly improve the efficiency of these computational investigations .    in this article",
    ", we approximate the deformation energy of lipid vesicles using surface harmonic functions .",
    "these real - valued functions are the linear combination of complex - valued spherical harmonics functions .",
    "they share the same orthonormal and completeness properties as spherical harmonics , and thus provide a natural basis for vesicle configurations of star - shape .",
    "the uniform convergence of spherical harmonic functions in approximating smooth functions enables us to choose far fewer number of basis functions to approximate vesicle surface when compared to finite element methods with a triangular mesh . with the surface harmonic expansion",
    ", one can analytically compute the variations of the deformation energy with respect to the expansion coefficients .",
    "a nonlinear conjugate gradient method is employed to numerically compute the minimizer of the deformation energy , without incurring the computationally cost evaluation of hessian matrix for the deformation energy .",
    "our numerical experiments below show that 49 surface harmonic functions are sufficient to represent axisymmetric prolate , oblate , and stomatocyte shapes as well as many nonaxisymmetric shapes .",
    "we note that complex - valued spherical harmonic functions were used to compute the local curvature of vesicles deformed by protein clusters , where least square solution of an over - determined linear systems for spherical harmonic expansion coefficients is solved using singular value decomposition @xcite . in a more relevant study ,",
    "a complex - valued spherical harmonic expansion is sought for each individual cartesian coordinate of the node on vesicle surface @xcite .",
    "curvature energy by itself can not account for the deformation and various biological functions of the membrane , the potential and kinetic energies arising in realistic intermolecular interactions shall be included in simulations @xcite .",
    "although the vesicle deformation can be well represented using spherical harmonic functions as shown in this study , whether the modeling of various intermolecular interactions and the total energy can be facilitated by the spherical harmonic expansions is to be determined . for fluid flows ,",
    "a simplified geometric representation of immersed vesicles will speed up the evaluation of flow field .",
    "for stokes flow in particular , the implementation of the stokeslet can be accelerated by using the analytical expression of the vesicle surfaces . in a companion paper",
    "we will show that our fast algorithm can be applied to minimize a total energy that ensembles both the deformation energy and the electrostatic potential energy arising from protein - membrane interactions , where a transfer matrix assigns the electrostatic force computed at an arbitrary point on vesicle using surface harmonic functions .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the bending energy of a lipid bilayer membrane and its variation along with the area and volume constraints .",
    "section 3 introduces surface harmonics and establishes the variational problem in terms of the surface harmonics parameterization .",
    "section 4 presents examples of equilibrium configurations and confirms these results from previous work in the literature .",
    "finally , section 5 discusses future developments of the model , including electrostatics from protein - membrane interactions .",
    "according to the classic spontaneous curvature model as developed by canham @xcite , helfrich @xcite , and evans @xcite , the bending energy of the membrane is given by @xmath0 = \\int_{\\gamma } \\left(\\frac{1}{2 } \\mathscr{k}_c ( 2h - c_0)^2 + \\mathscr{k}_g k \\right )   ds , \\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the bending modulus and gaussian saddle - splay modulus , respectively , @xmath3 is the mean curvature , @xmath4 is the spontaneous curvature , and @xmath5 is the gaussian curvature @xcite .",
    "the position of the membrane is given by @xmath6 , and so the total bending energy @xmath7 $ ] depends only upon the membrane position . an explicit formula for the differential surface area element @xmath8",
    "will be given in terms of the surface harmonic parameterization in section 3 .",
    "we assume that the spontaneous curvature of the membrane @xmath4 is a constant .    in the case of protein - membrane interactions",
    ", the membrane will also be under an external force .",
    "the potential energy from this interaction may be added to the total potential energy of the system , denoted by @xmath9 $ ] : @xmath10 = e[\\gamma ] + g[\\gamma],\\ ] ] where @xmath7 $ ] is the bending energy and @xmath11 $ ] is the electrostatic potential energy from the protein - membrane interaction . the introduction of the electrostatic potential energy will be discussed in the companion paper . for this paper , we only consider the bending energy @xmath7 $ ] .    to complete the total energy and account for the area expansion / contraction and osmotic pressure",
    ", the constraints for the conservation of the surface area of the membrane and the total volume enclosed are added to .",
    "the equilibrium position of the bilayer membrane is determined by the surfaces which minimize the bending energy with the surface area and volume constraints .",
    "the total potential energy ( neglecting any electrostatic potential energy for now ) with the penalty functions is given by @xmath12 = e[\\gamma ] + \\frac{k_s}{2}(s_a-\\bar{s})^2 + \\frac{k_v}{2}(v-\\bar{v})^2\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the total surface area and volume , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the initial surface area and volume , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are large constants to enforce the constraints to a chosen degree of precision .",
    "the minimization of gives rise to the bending curvature equation of @xmath6 , @xmath19 = \\delta_\\gamma e[\\gamma ] + k_s(s_a-\\bar{s})\\delta s_a + k_v(v-\\bar{v})\\delta v.\\ ] ] the computation of the terms in , , and depend on the choice of parameterization of the membrane surface .",
    "a convenient consequence of the bending energy of lipid bilayers is that the energy functionals are independent of the surface parameterization @xcite .",
    "therefore , we choose to parameterize the surface not by brute force , intrinsic cartesian coordinates , but by surface harmonics . since lipid vesicles are sphere - like structures , the choice of surface harmonics to represent the surface is natural , and this choice reduces the number of terms necessary for the computation .",
    "in this section , we introduce the surface harmonic parameterization , and provide formulas for the terms in , , and according to this parameterization .",
    "surface harmonic functions are a simplification of spherical harmonic functions .",
    "we choose to implement surface harmonics in our work to allow for an easier minimization algorithm .",
    "spherical harmonic functions are linear combinations of real valued spherical harmonics .",
    "spherical harmonics are solutions to laplace s equation in spherical coordinates .",
    "the solution can be obtained through separation of the variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; however , more convenient way to construct spherical harmonics is to use a generalization of legendre polynomials .",
    "legendre polynomials , also called legendre functions of the first kind , legendre coefficients , or zonal harmonics , are solutions to the legendre differential equation",
    ". the legendre polynomial can be defined by the contour integral @xmath22 another useful representation utilizes the rodrigues representation , @xmath23    the associated legendre polynomials generalize legendre polynomials , provided @xmath24 , and are defined by @xmath25 if @xmath26 , the associated legendre polynomial is just the legendre polynomial . by rodrigues formula , @xmath27 it is convenient to introduce the change of variables @xmath28 . in this way",
    ", the partial derivatives with respect to the polar angle @xmath29 $ ] may be computed . using this notation ,",
    "normalized spherical harmonic functions are defined by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the associated legendre polynomial evaluated at @xmath32 . since spherical harmonics form an orthonormal basis for @xmath33 , linear combinations of them can represent smooth surfaces .",
    "the surface is parameterized in spherical coordinates @xmath34 , where the radius @xmath35 is expressed in terms of spherical harmonics , @xmath36 the @xmath37 are the coefficients of the linear representation .",
    "these coefficients can be determined by the following formula : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the complex conjugate of @xmath40 .",
    "if the coefficients @xmath37 are poorly chosen so that the complex parts of @xmath37 and @xmath41 do not cancel the radius parameterizing the object will be complex . in an optimization routine ,",
    "the coefficients are perturbed arbitrarily , so any nonzero perturbation in the complex part will result in a complex surface .",
    "since we seek a real - valued surface that minimizes the potential energy , we use only the real parts of the spherical harmonics to ensure that the surface under the energy minimization is real .",
    "these are surface harmonics .    by euler s formula , each spherical harmonic function",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the normalization factor @xmath44 since the real and complex parts of are solutions to laplace s equation , we define the surface harmonics to be @xmath45 we now parameterize the radius of a smooth surface by a linear combination of the surface harmonics @xmath46 , @xmath47 a more convenient representation of the radius of a surface that avoids the sign changes in @xmath48 is @xmath49where @xmath50      discretize the surface by @xmath51 values of @xmath20 and @xmath52 values of @xmath21 for a total of @xmath53 points . since @xmath54 can be a very large number , performing pointwise calculations on the mesh can be computationally costly . under the surface harmonics parameterization ,",
    "the surface is approximated by truncating the infinite sum in at some number @xmath55 .",

    "<S> lipid vesicles appear ubiquitously in biological systems . understanding how the mechanical and intermolecular interations deform vesicle membrane is a fundamental question in biophysics . in this article we developed a fast algorithm to compute the surface configurations of lipid vesicles by introducing the surface harmonic functions to approximate the surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> this parameterization of the surfaces allows an analytical computation of the membrane curvature energy and its gradient for the efficient minimization of the curvature energy using a nonlinear conjugate gradient method . </S>",
    "<S> our approach drastically reduces the degrees of freedom for approximating the membrane surfaces compared to the previously developed finite element and finite difference methods . </S>",
    "<S> vesicle deformations with a reduced volume larger than 0.65 can be well approximated by using as small as 49 surface harmonic functions . </S>",
    "<S> the method thus has a great potential to reduce the computational expense of tracking multiple vesicles which deform for their interaction with external fields .    </S>",
