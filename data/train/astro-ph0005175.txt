    "pds 456 is a bright , _ radio - quiet _",
    "qso ( v=14 ) recently discovered by torres _",
    "( 1997 ) , in a search for young stellar objects .",
    "it lies fairly close to the galactic plane ( @xmath4 ) and is seen through an extinction of a@xmath5 .",
    "pds 456 is at a similar redshift ( z=0.184 ) to 3c 273 , but has a higher bolometric luminosity ( by a factor of @xmath61.7 , simpson et al .",
    "overall , pds 456 is the most luminous object in the local ( z  @xmath0 ) universe ( with m@xmath7 , l@xmath8  erg  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "we have conducted an extensive campaign to observe pds 456 from the radio through to the hard x - ray band . the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is shown in figure 1a and the optical spectrum in figure 1b .",
    "pds 456 shows strong h i emission lines , and like many nls1s has strong optical feii emission but weak oiii .",
    "although by definition a broad - line quasar , pds 456 has only a moderate width in h@xmath10 ( fwhm = 3000 km s@xmath9 ) .",
    "vla observations confirm that , unlike 3c 273 , pds 456 is radio - quiet ( r@xmath11=-0.7 ) and has little extended radio emission .",
    "overall the sed is dominated by the optical / uv ` big blue bump ' .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of pds  456 is of the order 10@xmath1  erg  s@xmath9 ( assuming @xmath12  kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "as part of our campaign , we observed pds  456 with asca on 7 - 8 march 1998 and with rxte on 7 - 10 march 1998 . the hard x - ray spectrum of pds 456 obtained by both asca and rxte shows complex features ( see reeves _ et al . _",
    "2000 for details ) .",
    "the data / model residuals from a power - law fit ( @xmath14 ) to the rxte data are shown in figure 2a .",
    "unsurprisingly a power - law gave an inadequate fit to the data in this band .",
    "we find that an unusually deep and ionised fe k edge is observed , with best - fit parameters of e=8.7@xmath150.2 kev and @xmath16 .",
    "the edge is detected in both the asca and rxte data to @xmath1799.99% confidence .",
    "there is also some evidence in the x - ray spectrum for a broadened ( @xmath18  kev ) line at  6 kev ; this line may originate from the inner disk , as hypothesised in seyfert 1s ( tanaka _ et al .",
    "a ` warm ' absorber of lower ionisation may also be present at soft x - ray energies , whose properties are also similar to those observed in seyfert 1s ( e.g. reynolds 1997 ) .    a model consisting of reflection off a highly ionised accretion disk provides the best - fit to the hard x - ray spectrum ; with disk solid angle , r=@xmath19 , ionisation parameter , @xmath20  erg  cm  s@xmath9 and t@xmath21  k. the high - ionisation of the disk reflection component can reproduce both the depth of the edge and its energy at 8.7 kev .",
    "such high - ionisation reflection features are predicted in disk photoionisation models ( e.g. ross , fabian & young 1999 , nayakshin et al . 1999 ) , particularly at high accretion rates when the primary x - ray emission is steep .",
    "therefore the high ionisation of the reflector could imply a high accretion rate in pds  456 ( relative to the eddington limit ) , particularly as @xmath22 for a photoionised accretion disk .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the other x - ray properties of pds  456 , namely a steep underlying x - ray continuum and rapid x - ray variability , both of which are commonplace in nls1s ( boller _ et al .",
    "nls1s are also thought to be accreting near the eddington limit ( e.g. pounds et al .",
    "1995 ) ; indeed recent evidence has been found in one nls1 ( ark 564 ) for a spectrum consistent with ionised disk reflection ( vaughan _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) .",
    "both the asca and rxte data were examined to search for x - ray variability .",
    "a strong hard x - ray flare is observed in the rxte observation ( figure 2b ) , well above any residual fluctuations in the detector background ; the doubling time for the flare was @xmath2  ksec .",
    "( note that , unfortunately , the shorter asca observation had ended by the time of the flare . )",
    "we also calculated that the probability of finding another contaminating source of comparable brightness in the rxte beam was low ( @xmath23% ) , although not totally excluded .",
    "additionally there is no other x - ray source detected in the rass ( rosat all sky survey ) to within a degree of pds 456 .",
    "therefore , if confirmed , this would be unprecedented behaviour in such a high - luminosity source .",
    "this suggests , from simple light - crossing arguments , a maximum size of @xmath24  m for the varying region . for a black hole of mass @xmath25m@xmath26 ( corresponding to pds  456 , with l@xmath27 erg  s@xmath9 , at the eddington limit )",
    ", this implies that the x - ray flare occurs * within a region of less than 2 schwarzschild radii * ( 2r@xmath28 ) .",
    "a smaller mass black hole would loosen this requirement somewhat , but would then imply a super - eddington accretion rate . _",
    "therefore one possible implication of the rapid variability is accretion near to or greater than l@xmath29 .",
    "_ the variability also implies a ( non - beamed ) efficiency of converting matter to energy of @xmath30  5% , close to the limit for a schwarzschild black hole ( see fabian 1979 ) .",
    "in conclusion , pds  456 is a remarkable object , showing clear features of a high ionisation reprocessor , one possible interpretation of which is through reflection off a highly ionised accretion disk .",
    "overall the high ionisation spectral features , steep x - ray emission and the extreme rapid variability suggest that the super - massive black hole in pds  456 could be running at an unusually high accretion rate .",
