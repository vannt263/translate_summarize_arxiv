    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) of elliptical galaxies is an empirical relation existing between the global properties of these galaxies .",
    "it was first mentioned in @xcite , where authors showed that normal elliptical galaxies are , at least , a two - parameter family ( the connection between velocity dispersion and line - strength ) .",
    "it was defined and discussed in more detail in e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the structural properties of dynamically hot galaxies ( central velocity dispersion , effective surface brightness and effective radius ) , as well as the global relationships of the stellar populations to their parent systems , are analyzed in @xcite . these fundamental plane properties are combined into a sort of 3d - phase space , where the axes are parameters that are physically meaningful .",
    "there are two main global properties of the fp , i.e. its _ tilt _ and _ tightness_. the so - called tilt of fp , with respect to the expected virial plane , which should contain all the considered self - gravitating systems , means that the coefficients of the fp equation differ from those predicted by the virial theorem : if written in logarithmic form , the two planes appear to be tilted by an angle of @xmath5 @xcite . by analyzing the properties of a sample of elliptical galaxies @xcite , it is possible to show that more than half of the tilt of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies is accounted for by the non - homology in the dynamical structures of the systems .",
    "it has also been shown that about 30 @xmath6 of the tilt can be explained by stellar population effects and by spatial non - homology , which is close to the agreed - upon modern value .",
    "there are also studies pointing out that the tilt is mainly driven by a mass - dependent dark matter ( dm ) fraction , such that more massive galaxies have larger dm fractions within effective ( half - light ) radius @xcite .",
    "some authors find that a hybrid interpretation of the fp should be preferred , where dynamical non - homology and dm effects seem to play a significant role in producing the tilt @xcite .    in this paper , we want to show that it is possible to recover the fp by considering corrections due to modified gravity .",
    "in particular , we will adopt @xmath0 gravity which is the straightforward generalization of einstein s general relativity as soon as the theory is @xmath7 , that is non - linear in the ricci scalar @xmath8 as in the hilbert - einstein action @xcite .    the idea that modification of gravity could be used as an alternative to dm was first proposed by milgrom in form of the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite .",
    "mond gave a number of successful predictions in the field of galactic dynamics , and achieved a significant success in explaining the flat rotational curves of spiral galaxies without dm , as well as in diminishing of its influence in ellipticals @xcite .",
    "besides , mond also inspired the development of modified relativistic gravitation theories ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these theories have recently become very popular due to the fact that allow to address dm and dark energy issues in a self - consistent way @xcite without considering new material ingredients non - interacting electromagnetically . besides",
    ", they fix several shortcomings of the standard cosmological model giving rise to natural inflationary scenarios @xcite .    here",
    ", we shall adopt a power law form of @xmath0 gravity , that is @xmath2 , that a part being the very first extension of einstein gravity ( e.g. @xmath9 with @xmath10 @xcite ) , has an important physical meaning being determined by the presence of noether symmetries in the interaction lagrangian @xcite . in other words , noether symmetries determine a further effective gravitational radius ( more than the standard schwarzschild radius ) and the value of the slope @xmath11 .",
    "such a radius and the slope of @xmath0 function determine the dynamical structure of self - gravitating systems . if confirmed by other observational evidences , this approach could point out that gravitational interaction is not scale - invariant and results holding for gr in solar system could not be valid at other scales ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this sense , instead of considering dark matter issues ,",
    "gravitational interaction should be revised at different scales like those of galaxies .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to recover the fp in the context of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "such an approach is twofold .",
    "from one side , this geometric view could help to interpret the dm , whose effect , also if observationally determined at any astrophysical scale , has not been revealed , up to now , at fundamental particle level neither by direct nor by indirect detection . on the other hand , fp could be a formidable test bed for alternative theories of gravity at galaxy scales .",
    "in fact , as already pointed out for spiral galaxies in @xcite , elliptical galaxies in @xcite , and clusters of galaxies in @xcite , alternative gravity could result a new paradigm in order to interpret extragalactic astrophysical structures . in particular ,",
    "as recently reported in @xcite , the authors analyzed rotation curves of two particular galaxies showing that power - law @xmath0 gravity fits them better than in presence of dm .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "[ sec1 ] is devoted to power - law @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we show that the corrected gravitational potential , solution of the field equations , can be used to model out self - gravitating systems .",
    "fp in view of @xmath0 gravity is discussed in sec .",
    "we show how velocity dispersion , effective radius and surface brightness can be recovered starting from the parameters of @xmath0 gravity solutions .",
    "the reconstruction of fp vs observational data , considering the @xmath0 interpretation , is reported in sec .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "let us now shortly review the @xmath0 gravity theory that can be considered a straightforward extension of einstein s general relativity .",
    "the action is :    @xmath12}\\ ] ]    where @xmath0 is an analytic function of the ricci curvature scalar @xmath8 and @xmath13 is the standard matter contribution .",
    "clearly @xmath14 implies the recovering of general relativity .",
    "the variation of the action with respect to the metric @xmath15 gives the field equations [ see @xcite ] :    @xmath16 + f'(r ) _ { ; \\mu \\nu } } \\nonumber \\\\ ~ & - & \\displaystyle{g_{\\mu \\nu } \\box{f'(r ) } \\bigg \\ } } + \\displaystyle{\\frac{t^{(m)}_{\\mu \\nu}}{f'(r ) } } \\label{eq : f - var2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath17 is the einstein tensor ; the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "the terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 are of fourth order in derivatives with respect the metric @xmath20 . the case @xmath21 is selected by the existence of noether symmetries in the theory .",
    "those symmetries are related to the presence of a conserved quantity in the dynamical system .",
    "physically , such a quantity gives rise to further gravitational radius other than the standard schwarzschild radius @xcite .",
    "a symmetry exists for any value of @xmath11 that is a real number . in the case",
    "@xmath22 , the theory becomes again of second order ( einstein s theory ) and the further gravitational radius is not present : in such a case , the only characteristic feature is the schwarzschild radius @xcite.the constant @xmath23 is chosen gives the right physical dimensions .",
    "let us now take into account the gravitational field generated by a pointlike source and solve the field equations ( [ eq : f - var2 ] ) . under the hypothesis of weak gravitational fields and slow motions ( the same holding for standard self - gravitating systems ) ,",
    "we can write the spacetime metric in spherical symmetry as :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the line element on the unit sphere . a physically motivated hypothesis to search for solutions is ( see the discussion in @xcite )    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the gravitational potential generated by a pointlike mass @xmath28 at the distance @xmath29 .",
    "it is possible to show that a solution is @xmath30 \\label{eq : pointphi}\\ ] ] where the gravitational potential deviates from the newtonian due to the correction induced by @xmath0 gravity . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath3 is the gravitational radius induced by the noether symmetry @xcite .",
    "note that , for @xmath32 , @xmath22 , the newtonian potential is exactly recovered and the metric reduces to the standard schwarzschild one . on the other hand , as shown in @xcite by taking into account extended self - gravitating systems , this term allows to fit galaxy rotation curves without the dm contribution .",
    "considering the solution ( [ eq : pointphi ] ) and ( [ eq : bnfinal ] ) , we can search for constraints on @xmath11 by imposing some physically motivated requirements to the modified gravitational potential .",
    "in the following , we will consider @xmath33 and use eq .",
    "( [ eq : bnfinal ] ) to infer @xmath11 from the estimated @xmath33 .",
    "a first reasonable condition is the non - divergence of the potential at infinity , that is    @xmath34    and then @xmath35 can not be positive .",
    "furthermore we can ask for recovering the newtonian potential in the solar system . as a consequence",
    ", one can require @xmath36 to avoid increasing @xmath37 in the solar system .",
    "this means that @xmath38 and then newtonian gravity is restored .",
    "these physical constraints are evaded considering solutions in the range    @xmath39    that , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bnfinal ] ) , gives @xmath40 as lower limit on the slope of the gravitational lagrangian .",
    "this means that the presence of symmetries selects the class of viable theories , in this case the power - law models , but additional requirements have to be imposed to achieve physical models , see also @xcite . ] .",
    "other considerations are in order at this point .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 controls the slope of the correction term while @xmath3 is the scale where deviations from the newtonian potential takes place . for reliable physical models , @xmath33 and @xmath3",
    "can be determined by observations at galactic scales . clearly , @xmath33 should be an almost universal parameter while @xmath3 , as in the case of the schwarzschild radius , should depend on the dynamical quantities ( mass , effective length , etc . ) of the given self - gravitating system .    before discussing how these considerations work for fp , it is worth evaluating the rotation curve for the pointlike case , i.e. the circular velocity @xmath41 of a test particle in the potential generated by the point mass @xmath28 . for a central potential , it is @xmath42 and then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pointphi ] ) , it is :    @xmath43 ,   \\label{eq : vcpoint}\\ ] ]    which means that the corrected rotation curve is the sum of two terms : the first one is equal to the half the newtonian curve @xmath44 , the second is the contribution related to @xmath0 gravity . for @xmath32 , the two terms sum up and reproduce exactly the newtonian result .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath33 in the range ( [ eq : brange ] ) , the corrected rotation curve is higher than the newtonian one .",
    "it is worth noticing that observations of spiral galaxy rotation curves point out circular velocities higher than what predicted by the observed luminous mass and the newtonian potential : this result suggests the possibility that @xmath0 gravitational potential can address the problem of galactic dynamics without additional dm ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "finally , we can say that similar considerations work also for elliptical galaxies @xcite and clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this means that the whole problem of dm could be addressed considering modified gravity @xcite .",

    ", this formula can summarize the kinematical , morphological and photometric features of a given object represented as a point in the parameter space @xmath48 .",
    "the velocity @xmath46 assumes the meaning of the characteristic velocity of the self - gravitating system that we are considering . in the case of elliptical galaxies , @xmath49 that is the central velocity dispersion @xcite",
    "this means that kinematics is not dominated by well defined circular velocities of orbiting objects ( stars ) as in the case of spiral galaxies ( called `` cold systems '' ) but we need a velocity distribution as in thermodynamics ( elliptical galaxies are called `` hot systems '' where a characteristic temperature @xmath50 is related to @xmath51 ) .",
    "more in detail , most elliptical galaxies exhibit little or no rotation .",
    "their stars have random velocities along the line of sight whose root mean square dispersion @xmath51 can be measured from the doppler broadening of spectral lines @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath52 strictly depends on the morphology and the homology properties of the systems @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that @xmath4 is typically of the order 3 kpc for bright ellipticals and smaller for fainter galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the largest luminous mass fraction of the galaxy is concentrated within @xmath4 so that it can be considered as a typical gravitational radius , being a galaxy a diffuse system without a defined boundary .",
    "we want to show that the fp could be modulated by @xmath0 , and in such a way the issues related to dm could be completely reproduced .    in this paper , we use the data given in table i of @xcite , which are the result of the collected efforts of many astronomers over the years ( as summarized in the table s explanation - available among the source files of its arxiv version ) .",
    "we want to recover fp using @xmath0 gravity , which means to find connection between the parameters of fp equation and parameters of the potential in eq .",

    "( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although gr is well working on these scales , some more recent studies indicate that it is not the case for the larger galactic scales where significantly larger values of @xmath33 can be obtained , showing that effects of @xmath2 gravity could start to work and should be taken into account at such scales .",
    "for example , as shown in @xcite , the value of this parameter which gives the best fit of the observed orbit of s2 star around the galactic centre is @xmath88 , i.e. four orders of magnitude larger than the previously mentioned upper bound in the case of solar system . besides , studies on low surface brightness galaxies and galaxy clusters indicate even much larger value @xmath89 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the cases of low surface brightness galaxies and galaxy clusters are extremely important in order to point out the breaking of gravity scale invariance at galactic scales .",
    "specifically , the fact that @xmath90 inside the solar system and significantly different from zero at galactic scales is the feature characterizing this issue .",
    "for example , as discussed in detail in @xcite by using the data reported in @xcite , the theoretical rotation curve of low surface brightness galaxies can be modeled as a function of three unknown quantities , namely the stellar @xmath91 ratio @xmath92 and the two theory parameters @xmath93 .",
    "actually , in @xcite , the fitting parameter has been @xmath94 rather than @xmath3 ( in kpc ) since this is a more manageable quantity that makes it possible to explore a larger range of parameter space .",
    "moreover , the gas mass fraction @xmath95 , rather than @xmath92 is another important fitting quantity @xcite since the range for @xmath95 is clearly defined , while this is not for @xmath92 .",
    "the two quantities are easily related as follows : @xmath96 with @xmath97 the gas ( hi + he ) mass , @xmath98 and @xmath99 the disk total mass and luminosity . to constrain the parameters @xmath100 , the following merit function has been minimized : @xmath101 ^ 2 } \\label{eq : defchi}\\ ] ] where the sum is over the @xmath102 observed points .",
    "while using the smoothed data helps in better adjusting the theoretical and observed rotation curves , the smoothing procedure implies that the errors @xmath103 on each point are non - gaussian distributed since they also take into account systematic misalignments between hi and h@xmath104 measurements and other effects leading to a conservative overestimate of the true uncertainties ( see the discussion in @xcite for further details ) .",
    "as a consequence , one does not expect that @xmath105 for the best fit model ( with @xmath106 the number of degrees of freedom ) , but one can still compare different models on the basis of the @xmath82 values .",
    "in particular , the uncertainties on the model parameters have estimated exploring the contours of equal @xmath107 in the parameter space . considering the observational data in @xcite the best fit value for low surface brightness galaxies is @xmath89 .",
    "similar procedures can be adopted for giant elliptical galaxies @xcite and galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the result is always that consistent deviations from newtonian gravity ( working in excellent way at solar system scales ) are found at galactic scales .",
    "all these results imply that gravity , most likely , could be not a scale invariant interaction , and thus @xmath33 could have different values depending on the scale of a gravitating system . taking this into account , as well as the fact that the effective galactic radii @xmath4 with size of @xmath108 kpc in average ( see @xcite ) , have the significant influence on fp",
    ", it is expected that @xmath33 should be much larger in the case of fp than for s2 star orbit around galactic centre ( which size is on the order of 1 mpc ) , and close to the values for the rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "therefore , we investigated the cases where @xmath33 ranges between 0.2 and 0.8 ( see tables 1 - 2 and figs . 4 - 8 ) . in summary , if further evidences will be found in this direction , these could indicate that the straightforward extrapolation of solar system results to any astrophysical and cosmological scale is an approach that has to be carefully revised .",

    ", @xmath33 should represent a universal constant and @xmath3 depends on the system s dynamical properties . from fig .",

    "3 , the value of parameter @xmath52 depends on the morphology and the homology properties of the sample of self - gravitating systems used to construct the fp @xcite . in other words ,",
    "considering ellipticals , spirals , dwarfs and so on gives different values for @xmath52 .",
    "geometrically , @xmath52 fixes the intersection of fp with the axes of parameter space .",
    "furthermore , morphology has a main role in determining the dm content of systems so parameters like @xmath33 and @xmath3 , that correct the newtonian potential , can be influenced by the observed values of @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the observational fp reported in @xcite for ellipticals , is well reproduced in the framework of power law @xmath0 gravity as soon as @xmath124 and @xmath125 . in such a case , the parameters @xmath126 of eq.([equ10 ] ) are in excellent agreement with observations without considering the presence of dm .",
    "in recent years dm as well as dark energy are become the main issues in cosmology and astrophysics because also if their effects are observed at almost every scale , their detection as new fundamental particles remains very elusive and complicated . in other words , also if the macroscopic , large scale ( infrared ) effects of these components are clearly evident , the quantum physics counterpart ( new particles at ultraviolet scales ) can not be easily found out . this puzzling situation could be overcome by considering the gravitational sector and the possibility to extend general relativity at large scales by retaining its positive results at local and solar system scales .",
    "addressing astrophysical systems and the whole universe evolution by modified or extended gravity is a compelling approach with respect to introducing the _ dark side _ in the cosmological dynamics . in this perspective",
    ", fp can play a major role as test bed for these theories in view of explaining galactic structures without dm .",
    "specifically , fp is a formidable tool in extragalactic astrophysics used to study the evolution and the dynamics of self - gravitating systems like elliptical galaxies , bulges of spiral galaxies , globular clusters and so on . in some sense ,",
    "the role of fp for galaxies could be similar to the herzsprung - russell diagram for stars : a bivariate sequence of characteristic parameters assigns the position and then the evolution on a sort of suitable phase - space of hot stellar systems .",
    "however , as reported in @xcite and @xcite , a quite large amount of physical processes can affect the shape ( tightness ) and the position ( tilt ) of fp in this phase - space .",
    "in particular , the presence of dm strongly affects the position of objects in fp determining also their evolution .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the possibility to reproduce the fp of galaxies ( in particular elliptical galaxies ) adopting the corrected gravitational potential coming out as solution of power law @xmath127 gravity , a straightforward extension of einstein s general relativity related to the existence of noether symmetries that select the value of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have shown that @xmath2 gravity gives the same @xmath51 for elliptical galaxies as in the newtonian case , but for spiral galaxies ( and other non - ellipticals ) it is not the case .",
    "we obtained that for elliptical galaxies the characteristic radius @xmath3 is proportional to the effective radius @xmath4 , more precise @xmath128 gives the best fit with data .",
    "an important point has to be stressed again at this point .",
    "the effective radius @xmath4 , observationally derived from photometry , actually is a gravitational radius in the sense that its value is determined by the self - gravitating luminous matter content in the inner part of the elliptical galaxy .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , it can be defined for any spheroidal system where gravity is the dominant interaction . the previous assumption that @xmath129 is motivated by the fact that also @xmath3 is a gravitational radius that comes out from the theory . since",
    "observational fp gives @xmath125 , this can be considered as a sort of consistency check that both ( observational ) @xmath4 and ( theoretical ) @xmath3 are gravitational radii .",
    "we want to stress again that @xmath3 radius is a gravitational radius , and it comes out from the fact that a fourth order theory of gravity , like @xmath0 , gives a further gravitational radius than the schwarzschild one . as shown in @xcite , this further radius comes directly from the presence of a noether symmetry .",
    "considering the definition of @xmath4 , we are saying that the effective radius ( defined photometrically as the radius containing half of the luminosity of a galaxy ) is , in some sense , led by gravity .      1",
    ".   the observed fp for elliptical galaxies can be reproduced by @xmath2 gravity .",
    "in particular , we have shown that @xmath2 gravity gives the same @xmath51 for elliptical galaxies as in the newtonian case ; 2 .",
    "the assumption that the characteristic radius @xmath3 of @xmath2gravity is proportional to the effective radius @xmath4 of elliptical galaxies can be probed : we probed the ratio of this quantities and that , under this assumption , f(r ) is able to reproduce the fp .",
    "thus , if we take into account the definition of @xmath4 , this indicates that the effective radius ( defined photometrically as the radius containing half of the luminosity of a galaxy ) is led by gravity ; 3 .   in the range @xmath130 , the values of @xmath33 , which are deduced from the lsb galaxies @xcite and galaxy clusters @xcite , are in agreement with fp of elliptical galaxies . in other words , the same range of values of @xmath3 and @xmath33 work at galactic scales . the fact that these values are larger than the corresponding values obtained from the observational data at smaller scales , such as those from solar system , may indicate that gravity is not a scale invariant interaction .",
    "this point deserves some comment . in @xcite ,",
    "the analysis of low surface brightness galaxies , performed in @xcite , has been extended to a wider class of objects containing also high surface brightness galaxies , while in @xcite the baryonic tully - fisher relation has also been adopted besides the low surface galaxies sample . in the first case ,",
    "the result was @xmath131 , in the second case , it was @xmath132 .",
    "both cases are consistent with the present result @xmath133 but the lesson is that morphology and homology determine corrections to the newtonian potential . on the other hand , the result @xmath90 , from cassini and other solar system experiments , clearly means that at local scales such corrections are not relevant ; 4 .",
    "the further gravitational radius @xmath3 is related to the radius of galactic bulges or the hot spherical component of galaxies . in the present case ,",
    "it is related to @xmath4 that is the effective radius of ellipticals .    in conclusion",
    ", the observed empirical fp can be reproduced by @xmath0 gravity without assuming dm while the photometry of the systems is led by the gravitational corrections .",
    "these preliminary results can be improved considering detailed samples of data and different classes of objects .",
    "a final remark is now necessary . as we said above",
    ", the reported results seem to point out that , in absence of dark matter , gravity is not a scale - invariant interaction .",
    "this means that constraints working at solar system level for general relativity could not be simply extrapolated at any astrophysical and cosmological scale .",
    "besides , the presence of noether symmetries could rule the strength and the shape of gravitational interaction at different scales . in our case , the couple of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath33 indicate if given self - gravitating systems ( in this case elliptical galaxies ) sit or not on fp . however further and detailed investigations are necessary to confirm this delicate statement .",
