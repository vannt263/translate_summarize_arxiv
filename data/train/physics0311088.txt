    "optical spectroscopy is a powerful instrument for investigation of the electronic and ionic structure of clusters as well as their thermal and dynamical properties . during the last decades these issues",
    "have been intensively investigated both experimentally by means of photodepletion and photodetachment spectroscopy and theoretically by employing the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) , configuration interaction ( ci ) and random - phase approximation ( rpa ) ( for review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these methods have been used in conjunction with either jelium model @xcite defined by a hamiltonian , which treats the electrons in a cluster in the usual quantum mechanical way , but approximates the field of the ionic core treating it as a uniform positively charged background , or with _ ab initio _ calculations of the electronic and ionic cluster structure , where all or at least valence electrons in the system are treated accurately .    during the last years",
    ", numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have been devoted to the study of optical response properties of alkali metal clusters .",
    "the plasmon resonances formation in na , k and li clusters has been studied both theoretically and experimentally ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some attention was also devoted to the splitting and broadening of the plasmon resonances ( see citations above ) .",
    "the mentioned metal elements belong to the first group of the periodic table , i.e. possess one @xmath2-valence electron .",
    "the situation differs for clusters of the alkali - earth metals of the second group of the periodic table , such as be , mg , ca .",
    "study of these clusters is of particular interest , because they exhibit a transition from the weak van der waals bonding being the characteristic of the diatomic molecule to the metallic bonding present in the bulk .",
    "thus , significant attention was paid to the magnesium clusters .",
    "various properties of mg clusters , such as their structure , the binding energy , ionization potentials , homo - lumo gap , average distances , and their evolution with the cluster size have been investigated theoretically ( see @xcite and references therein ) . recently ,",
    "the mass spectrum of mg clusters was recorded @xcite and the sequence of magic numbers was determined .",
    "the investigation of optical response of small mg clusters has not been performed so far in spite of the fact that it should carry a lot of useful information about the dynamic properties of magnesium clusters .    in this paper",
    "we predict the strong enhancement in the photoabsorption of small @xmath0 clusters in the region of 4 - 5 ev due to the resonant excitation of the plasmon oscillations of the cluster electrons . using all electron _ ab initio _",
    "tddft we calculate the spectra for cluster structures with up to 11 atoms possessing the lowest energy .",
    "the geometries of these clusters were calculated using all electron dft methods and described in our recent work @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on the formation of the plasmon resonances in magnesium clusters .",
    "we elucidate their nature by comparing our results with the results of the classical mie theory and analyse the splitting of the plasmon resonances caused by the cluster deformation .",
    "theoretical methods used in our calculations are based on the density functional theory and many - body - perturbation theory . in the present work we use the gradient - corrected becke - type three - parameter exchange functional @xcite paired with the gradient - corrected lee , yang and parr correlation functional ( b3lyp ) @xcite , as well as with the gradient - corrected perdew - wang 91 correlation functional ( b3pw91 ) @xcite .",
    "we do not present the explicit forms of these functionals , because they are somewhat lengthy , and refer to the original papers @xcite .",
    "our calculations have been performed with the use of the gaussian 98 software package @xcite .",
    "we have utilized the 6 - 311+g(d ) basis set of primitive gaussian functions to expand the cluster orbitals @xcite .",
    "the absorption of light by small metal spheres has been investigated theoretically by mie long ago ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for particles with the diameter being considerably smaller than the wavelength",
    ", the absorption cross section based on the drude dielectric function reads as :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the surface - plasma frequency of a sphere with @xmath5 free electrons , @xmath6 is the photon frequency , @xmath7 represents the width of the resonance , @xmath8 is the electron mass , @xmath9 is its charge and @xmath10 is the light velocity . equation ( [ photoabsdrude ] ) assumes that the dipole oscillator strengths are exhausted by the surface plasma resonance at @xmath4 . in metal clusters this resonance corresponds to the collective oscillation of the spherical valence - electron cloud against the positive background .",
    "using the sum rule one can easily show ( see e.g. @xcite ) that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the static polarizability of the cluster . for a classical metal sphere , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wigner - seitz radius .",
    "with @xmath15 a.u . for na and @xmath16 for mg @xcite ,",
    "one derives the classical surface - plasma - resonance energies @xmath17 ev and @xmath18 ev for @xmath19 and @xmath0 respectively",
    ".    for small metal clusters the photoabsorption pattern differs significantly from the mie prediction . in these systems",
    "the plasmon resonance energy is smaller as compared to the metal sphere case .",
    "the lowering of the plasmon energies in small metal clusters occurs because of the spill out effect according to which the electron density is spilled out of the cluster , increasing its volume and polarizability . for example , for spherical @xmath20 and @xmath21 clusters the average static polarizability is 796.840 ( a.u ) and 1964.484 ( a.u . ) respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , the plasmon resonance energies , @xmath4 , read as 2.73 and 2.75 ( ev ) for @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively . beside the lowering of the plasmon resonance energy in small metal clusters the photoabsorption pattern is splitted .",
    "this fragmentation arises mainly due to the cluster deformation . with the use of the sum rule , equation ( [ photoabsdrude ] )",
    "can be generalized and written in the following form ( see e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 are the transition energies , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the corresponding oscillator strengths and widths , @xmath26 is the total number of the resonant transitions .    in the case of the triaxial cluster deformation the photoabsorption cross section possesses the three peak structure .",
    "the splitting of the plasmon resonance into three peaks can easily be understood assuming the ellipsoidal form of the cluster surface . within the framework of the deformed jelium model the ionic density",
    "is considered to be uniform within the volume confined by the ellipsoid surface defined by @xmath27 .",
    "if one assumes that the electron density fills in entirely in the interior of the ionic ellipsoid , one finds the following dipole plasmon energies corresponding to the electron density oscillations in three directions @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , ( for more details see @xcite ) :    @xmath31\\\\ \\nonumber \\omega_y&=&\\omega_{0}\\left[1+\\frac{\\delta cos\\gamma}{5}(1+\\sqrt{3}tan\\gamma)\\right]\\\\ \\nonumber \\omega_z&=&\\omega_{0}\\left[1-\\frac{2\\delta cos\\gamma}{5}\\right]\\\\ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the classical mie frequency being the average of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the deformation parameters defined by equations : @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "note that in the axially symmetric case one derives @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "clusters with @xmath42 using the @xmath43 method .",
    "vertical solid lines show the oscillator strengths for the optically allowed transitions .",
    "their values are shown in the left hand side of the plots .",
    "the right hand side of each plot shows the scale for the corresponding photoabsorption cross section .",
    "cluster geometries calculated in @xcite are shown in the insets .",
    "the label near each cluster image shows the sum of the oscillator strengths and the excitation energy range considered . by solid and dotted arrows we show the adiabatic and vertical ionization potentials respectively , calculated in @xcite . ]    in figure [ spectra_mg ] , we present the oscillator strengths for the dipole transitions calculated for the most stable cluster isomers of @xmath44-@xmath45 .",
    "cluster geometries are shown in the insets to the figure .",
    "they were calculated and discussed in @xcite .    for sodium @xcite ,",
    "the plasmon resonance arises for the clusters with less than 10 atoms .",
    "thus , it is natural to expect that for the magnesium clusters with @xmath46 the formation of the plasmon resonance should be clearly seen .    calculating the oscillator strengths @xmath24 and substituting the found values in equation [ photoabs ] , we obtain the photoabsorption cross sections for magnesium clusters plotted in figure [ spectra_mg ] . in this calculation",
    "we have used the width @xmath47 ev , which is the average width for @xmath19 clusters at room temperature @xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not calculate the excitation line widths for @xmath0 clusters and do not investigate the line widths temperature dependence .",
    "these interesting problems are beyond the scope of the present paper and deserve a separate careful consideration .    in the photoabsorption spectra for @xmath44 and @xmath48",
    "one can identify the strong resonances in the vicinity of 4 ev , which can be interpreted as the plasmon resonances splitted due to the cluster deformation .",
    "below , we discuss this splitting in more detail . for larger clusters ,",
    "the plasmon resonance energy increases slowly and evolves towards the bulk value , 6.26 ev , see dots in figure [ energies ] .",
    "the lowering of the plasmon resonance energy in small mg clusters as compared to its bulk value occurs because of the spill out effect .    ,",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 : x ( upper triangles ) , y ( lower triangles ) and z ( left triangle ) .",
    "circles are the mie - frequencies @xmath4 being the average of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . ]    there are two main factors , which determine the resonance pattern of the photoabsorption spectra for magnesium clusters : collective plasmon excitations of the delocalized electrons and the resonant transitions of the electrons bound in a single magnesium atom . in the excitation energy range",
    "considered , the photoabsorption spectrum of a single mg atom exhibits the two strong resonant excitations : @xmath49 and @xmath50 with the energies ( oscillation strengths ) 4.346 ( 1.8 ) and 6.118 ( 0.2 ) ev respectively @xcite .",
    "the td / b3pw91/6 - 311+g(d ) method gives the following energies and the oscillator strengths for these lines : 4.225 ( 1.63 ) and 5.765 ( 0.29 ) ev , which are in the reasonable agreement with the data given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath51 line can be easily identified in the photoabsorption spectrum for @xmath44 . in terms of the plasmon resonance excitations",
    ", this line corresponds to the oscillations of the electronic density perpendicular to to the cluster axis , while the strong line in the vicinity of 3 ev corresponds to the collective electron oscillations along the cluster axis . for larger clusters ,",
    "the @xmath51 line is strongly coupled with the plasmon resonance excitation occurring at the close energy .",
    "the situation is different for the @xmath52 line . due to its higher energy",
    ", this excitation line does not couple that strongly with the plasmon resonance and can be identified in the photoabsorption spectra for the @xmath44 , @xmath48 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 clusters in addition to the plasmon resonances . for larger clusters",
    "( e.g. @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , due to the growth of their plasmon resonance energies , the @xmath52 line becomes more and more of the plasmon resonance type .    for many clusters",
    "the plasmon resonance is splitted .",
    "this splitting arises mainly due to the cluster deformation . in order to illustrate this effect we plot in figure [ energies ] the energies @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 of the strongest resonances versus the cluster size . using equation ( [ split ] ) , we determine the deformation parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 and present them in figure [ deformation ] .",
    "one can distinguish four different cases : i ) @xmath58 the cluster is spherical ( see @xmath59 ) ; ii ) @xmath60 , @xmath40 the cluster is oblate ( see @xmath61 ) ; iii ) @xmath62 , @xmath40 the cluster is prolate ( see @xmath63 ) ; iv ) @xmath64 , @xmath65 the cluster is triaxially deformed ( see @xmath66 ) .",
    "this analysis shows that most of the clusters considered are close to the axially symmetric form , although some clusters ( @xmath53 and @xmath55 ) are triaxially deformed .",
    "note that many additional satellite resonances appear in the photoabsorption spectra .",
    "the additional satellite lines are often the result of higher order cluster deformations .",
    "thus , they are beyond the ellipsoidal model .    to show the connection between the plasmon resonance splitting and the cluster deformation we have determined the plasmon resonance energies for @xmath44 and @xmath48 from the mie theory via the static dipole polarizabilities of the clusters and compared them with the tddft result .",
    "the principle values of cluster polarizability tensor @xmath67 , @xmath68,@xmath69 are 130.386 , 130.386 , 246.769 ( a.u ) for @xmath44 and 282.412 , 282.412 , 159.757 ( a.u . ) for @xmath48 respectively .",
    "thus , the plasmon resonance energies @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 read as 4.82 , 4.82 , 3.39 ( ev ) for @xmath44 and 3.8 , 3.8 , 5.46 ( ev ) for @xmath48 respectively .",
    "these values are very close to those obtained directly from the photoabsorption spectra analysis and presented in figure [ energies ] .",
    "this fact independently proves that the plasmon resonance is already formed in such small systems .        in insets to figure [ spectra_mg ] , we present the sum of the oscillator strengths and the excitation energy range considered for each cluster .",
    "the sum of the oscillator strengths characterises the valence electrons delocalization rate .",
    "note , that for many clusters it is close to the total number of valence electrons in the system .",
    "for some clusters the total sum of the oscillator strengths is significantly smaller than the number of the valence electrons ( see , for example , @xmath57 , @xmath45 ) . to increase the sum of the oscillator strengths one has to calculate the photoabsorption spectra up to the higher excitation energies .",
    "the calculation of cluster excited states becomes an increasingly difficult problem with the growth of the cluster size , because of the rapid growth of the number of possible excited states in the system . in this paper",
    "we focus on the investigation of the plasmon resonances in small @xmath0 clusters , manifesting themselves in the energy range about 4 - 5 ev as it is clear from our discussion .",
    "therefore , for clusters with @xmath70 , we have calculated the photoabsorption spectra only up to the excitation energies of about 6 ev , which is significant for the elucidation of the plasmon resonance structure and at the same time it does not acquire substantial computer power .    , @xmath71 using the b3lyp functional ( solid lines ) .",
    "vertical lines show the oscillator strengths for the optically allowed transitions .",
    "cluster geometries calculated in @xcite are shown in the insets .",
    "the label near each cluster image shows the sum of the oscillator strengths , the excitation energy range considered and the line width .",
    "we compare our results with experimentally measured photoabsorption spectra @xcite ( dots ) and with the results of previous _ ab initio _ ci calculation @xcite ( dashed lines ) . ]",
    "photoabsorption spectra for sodium clusters have been earlier investigated in a large number of papers .",
    "there were performed experimental measurements , as well as theoretical calculations @xcite involving _ ab initio _ and model approaches . in order to check the level of accuracy of our calculation method , in figure [ spectra_na ] , we compare the photoabsorption spectra for a few selected neutral and singly charged sodium clusters , calculated with the use of the methods described above , with the results of experimental measurements and other calculations . in figure",
    "[ spectra_na ] , the experimentally measured photoabsorption spectra for @xmath72 , @xmath71 are plotted by dots .",
    "the results of our tddft calculation performed with the use of the b3lyp functional are shown by solid lines .",
    "the ci results of bonai - kouteck _ et al _ @xcite are shown by dashed lines .    in @xcite we demonstrated that the b3lyp functional is well applicable for the description of sodium clusters .",
    "thus , we used it for the photoabsorption spectra computations .",
    "the comparison shown in figure [ spectra_na ] demonstrates that our calculation method is a good alternative to the ci method , and our results are in a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the photoabsorption spectrum of @xmath73 has a prominent peak at the energy about 2.3 ev , which can be identified as a mie plasmon resonance .",
    "this peak is also seen in the photoabsorption spectra of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath20 .",
    "the plasmon resonance energy for these clusters is smaller than the bulk value , 3.4 ev , because of the spill out effect .",
    "as it is seen from figure [ spectra_na ] , the resonance energy evolves slowly towards the bulk limit with increasing cluster size . for the @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ,",
    "the plasmon peak is hardly to identify in the distribution of oscillator strengths , which means that the number of delocalized electrons in these clusters turns out to be insufficient for the formation of the plasmon resonance in this system , see figure [ spectra_na ] .",
    "note , that often the plasmon peaks for sodium clusters are splitted due to the cluster axial quadrupole deformation .",
    "using equations ( [ deformation ] ) , we have calculated the deformation parameters for axially symmetric @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the result reads as @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "the deformation parameter @xmath37 vanishes for both clusters .",
    "the axially symmetric jelium model leads to the following values of @xmath36 @xcite : @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "comparison shows that the splitting of the plasmon resonances can be explained by cluster deformation .",
    "in this paper we predict the enhancement of the photoabsorption spectra for small mg clusters in the vicinity of plasmon resonance .",
    "the photoabsorption spectra for neutral @xmath0 clusters consisting of up to @xmath1 atoms have been calculated using _ ab initio _ framework based on the time dependent density functional theory .",
    "the nature of predicted resonances have been elucidated by comparison of the results of the _ ab initio _ calculations with the results of the classical mie theory .",
    "the splitting of the plasmon resonances caused by the cluster deformation is analysed .",
    "the reliability of the used calculation scheme has been proved by performing the test calculation for a number of sodium clusters and the comparison of the results obtained with the results of other methods and experiment .",
    "the calculation of the photoabsorption spectra for larger clusters requires much more computer power and is left open for further investigations .",
