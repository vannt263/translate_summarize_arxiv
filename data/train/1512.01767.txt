    "in  @xcite , the sum - rate scaling was originally introduced and characterized in large wireless _ ad hoc _ networks . in practice , however , there will be a long latency and insufficient energy with only wireless connectivity in ad hoc networks .",
    "hence , it would be good to deploy infrastructure nodes , or equivalently base stations ( bss ) , in the network model , i.e. , hybrid networks , thereby possibly improving the throughput scaling .    in most network applications , energy efficiency and cost effectiveness",
    "are key performance measures for greenness  @xcite along with the throughput .",
    "this is because 1 ) the operating cost of bss , driven in part by inefficient diesel power generators , is one of the largest concerns and 2 ) given the economic and environmental cost , there is a need of environmental grounds to reduce the energy requirement of network architecture . from a telecommunications operator",
    "s point of view , the following two benefits can arise from green communications : reduced energy and network deployment costs , and improved environmental effects . especially for large - scale hybrid networks with long - distance wired backhaul links connecting all the bss ,",
    "the _ deployment cost of infrastructure _ is a critical issue for service providers since it not only directly relates to the capex ( capital expenditures ) as well as opex ( operational expenditures )  @xcite but also can have significant environmental impacts  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the increasing number of small cells in the fifth generation ( 5 g ) will result in a significant growth in the number of connections between cell sites .",
    "first of all , high capex / opex associated with high backhaul costs may limit the usefulness of such infrastructure - supported protocols in large hybrid networks  @xcite .",
    "it is thus vital to significantly dimension the backhaul bandwidth ( or equivalently the backhaul capacity ) to reduce the cost of the operators  @xcite .      in this paper , by taking into account greenness in hybrid networks , we introduce a more general hybrid network with _ cost - effective _ infrastructure ( named _ greeninfra _ ) , where the rate of each bs - to - bs link scales at an arbitrary rate relative to the number of nodes , @xmath0 .",
    "greeninfra nodes equipped with a large number of antennas are deployed in the network , and the best among the two bs - supported schemes in  @xcite , i.e. , infrastructure - supported single - hop ( ish ) and infrastructure - supported multihop ( imh ) protocols , is used to characterize an aggregate throughput of the network .",
    "more precisely , only infrastructure - supported routing protocols are used for analysis since our main focus is on how the rate of each backhaul link needs to effectively scale .",
    "that is , no pure ad hoc routing protocols such as multihop ( mh )  @xcite and hierarchical cooperation  @xcite are taken into account .",
    "then , we generalize the throughput scaling result achieved by the ish and imh protocols with an arbitrary scaling of each backhaul link , which is not definitely straightforward .    our results present a cost - effective approach for the deployment of backhaul links connecting a great deal of cell sites ( i.e. , bss ) .",
    "in order to provide a cost - effective solution to the design of greeninfra , we first derive the minimum rate of each bs - to - bs link , denoted by @xmath1 , required to guarantee the same throughput scaling as in the network using infinite - capacity backhaul links . the required backhaul link rate @xmath1 is shown according to the two - dimensional operating regimes with respect to the number of bss and the number of antennas at each bs .",
    "this backhaul link rate is determined by the multiplication of the number of matched source  destination ( s  d ) pairs between any different two cells and the bs - to - bs transmission rate for each s  d pair , which is not straightforward since the number of active s  d pairs between two cells and the bs - to - bs transmission rate vary according to the operating regimes .",
    "surprisingly , it turns out that , for some operating regimes , the required backhaul link rate @xmath1 can be indeed sufficiently small , which scales much slower than @xmath2 for an arbitrarily small @xmath3 , and thus does not need to be infinitely large .",
    "large - scale ad hoc networks are shown to be fundamentally power - limited and/or bandwidth - limited  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we are interested in further identifying the _ infrastructure - limited _ regime in which the routing protocol can not achieve its maximum throughput scaling due to the small backhaul link rate . from the infrastructure - limited regime , one can find the operating regimes , in which the associated throughput scaling can be improved by increasing the backhaul link rate for network design .",
    "finally , we analyze the aggregate throughput scaling for realistic hybrid networks including the case where the rate of each backhaul link scales slower than @xmath1 , which is based on the derivation of the transmission rate for each infrastructure - supported routing protocol . to validate the throughput scaling law for finite values of system parameters",
    ", we also provide numerical results via comprehensive computer simulations , which are shown to be consistent with our achievability results .",
    "our results indicate that a judicious rate scaling of each bs - to - bs link under a given operating regime leads to the order optimality of our general hybrid network along with greeninfra . in other words",
    ", we can still achieve the optimal throughput scaling of the network by significantly reducing the backhaul link rate ( equivalently , the cost of backhaul links ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we note that , in the next generation communications , the wireless backhaul is considered as an alternative to wired backhaul  @xcite .",
    "our generalized scaling result provides the theoretical limit on the performance of the wireless backhaul whose link rate can be smaller than the minimum required rate .",
    "our main contribution is fourfold as follows :    * as a cost - effective backhaul solution , we derive the minimum rate of each backhaul link required to achieve the same throughput scaling law as in the infinite - capacity backhaul link case . * to better understand the fundamental capabilities of our hybrid network with greeninfra",
    ", we explicitly identify the infrastructure - limited regime according to the number of bss , the number of antennas at each bs , and the rate of each backhaul link . * to show a more general achievability result , we derive the aggregate throughput scaling with respect to an arbitrary rate scaling of each backhaul link . *",
    "we show the numerical results via computer simulations .",

    "system ] , system and channel models are described .",

    "have been extensively studied in @xcite by showing that bss can be indeed beneficial in improving the network throughput . moreover ,",
    "one of the most viable ways to meet growing traffic demands for the high data rate is to use large - scale ( massive ) multiple antennas at each bs  @xcite  such large - scale multiple antenna systems can be thought to be easily implemented in very high frequency bands ( e.g. , millimeter wave bands  @xcite ) .",
    "especially , in a hybrid network where each bs is equipped with a large number of antennas , the optimal capacity scaling was characterized in  @xcite  the achievability result is based on using one of two infrastructure - supported routing protocols , i.e , ish and imh protocols , pure mh transmission , and hierarchical cooperation strategy .",
