    "recent research activity generated not only the valuable advance in understanding the nature of object but stimulated the experimental efforts in development the object - oriented tools .    here",

    "ade computing separates the database access and the user interface .",
    "the variety of applications may be generated that communicate with different and distinct desktop databases .",
    "the advanced techniques allows to involve remote or stored procedures retrieval and call .    according to an object - oriented traditions @xcite ,",
    "ade include some basic features of inheritance , encapsulation , and polymorphism .",
    "they are used to derive an actual object to cover the needed information resources .    the _ potential object _ ( po ) is composed with the _ menu _ ( m ) , _ data access _ ( da ) , and _ modular counterparts _ ( mc ) .",
    "the _ ancestor potential objects _ ( apo ) contain the menus , events , event evolver , attributes and functions ( that are encapsulated ) . the _ descendant potential objects _ ( dpo )",
    "are inherited from apo .",
    "the aim of the current contribution is to give a brief profile of the ade project without any detailed mathematical or implementational consideration .",
    "nevertheless , some mathematical background corresponds to the references @xcite , @xcite . other less traditional for the database area ideas are due to @xcite to conform the _ object computation _ strategies .",
    "the main ade building blocks have the relative uniformity to resolve the modular linkages .",

    "the mc is a holder of all the controls to communicate with the user .",
    "the event is assigned by the user call ( for instance , clicking ) or selection .",
    "thus , when the activity is initiated , the following main events may be triggered : respond to a request from the user application , database retrieval or updating .",

    "some vital concepts have clear mathematical representations : _ data object _ that represents the computer stored data ; _ metadata object _ that represents the conceptual information ; _ assignment _ that captures more dynamics and intrinsic states ; _ expansible database _ that represent the individualized self contained object couples .",
    "the main feature of the general approach is in embedding the typed entities ( also the variable concepts ) into the typeless system that is based on the a theory of the variable concepts .",
    "the last one is fitted to capture the dynamics of different objects and switching the states in the information systems .",
    "the prescribed modes in the information systems as a rule are corresponded to the known classic cases : the relational database theory , frame theory and logical reasoning in knowledge systems , theory of programming .",

    "the ade notion is based on the theory of variable concepts in the form of variable sets originate from f.lawvere investigations carried out in 1970 s .",

    "science variable sets are used in the form of variable domains theories in denotational semantics of programming languages ( pioneer investigations by c.starchey & c.wadsworth [ 1974 ] ) .",
    "variable collections ( sets ) are more widely used in computer science in the from of approximation lattices ( works by d.s .",
    "scott commenced in 1969 , @xcite ) with employing infinite domain .",
    "an attempt to formalize an idea of ` information system ' with infinite domain is known as continuity principle and called scott - belnap s thesis ) . in",
    "the early 1980 s d.s.scott resumed his analysis of the idea of variable domains because of the nature of lambda - calculus models and related formal systems ( like combinatory logic ) having been elucidated .",
    "logician h.curry and his school independently investigated the concepts of the ` object ' and the ` substitution ' in order to render theoretical computer science with the trustworthy representations from the early 1960 s ( in fact , even earlier ) .",
    "the results obtained by h.curry-d.s.scott became the mathematical foundations of modern computer science and inspired many subsequent works , e.g. d.turner ( [ 1979 ] applicative programming ) , t.hughes ( [ 1982 ] supercombinators in programming ) , p .-",

    "( [ 1990 - 91 ] functional programming languages reducible to collections ( systems ) of combinators ) .",
    "all these investigations as well as adjoining contemporary works employ the idea of ` object ' borrowed from the combinatory logic ( in the sense of curry - scott ) . the analysis of problems arose and , in particular , representation of transition processes in information systems ( dependency of program code on the basis of combinators , transition from some basis to another etc . )",
    "reflects the principle effect of varying the primary established objects .",
    "the attempts of partial solutions do not result in an adequate mathematical apparatus .",
    "some advance was done within the _ applicative _ computational framework ( see references in  @xcite ) .",
    "the starting point for ade project originates from the various object notions .",
    "known results in the field of relational data bases ( originated from works by e. codd and his school [ 1972 and later ] ) , in the field of conceptual modelling ( m.brodie [ 1984 and later ] ) , in the field of knowledge based systems ( including inference and transformation mechanisms ) chiefly deal with established modes of information systems . establishing the representation of a concept as invariant on variations , creating the tools of ` evolving the concept ' as a mathematical process overtakes these essential difficulties and are put into fundamentals of analysis an information system dynamics ( also the transition or switching processes ) .",
    "developing the theory of variable concepts naturally arises from the very process of creating theoretical foundations of computer science .",
    "information systems contain besides database ( db ) also the metadata base ( mdb ) that does include different facts concerning database . in applications metadata bases are used as the components of knowledge system with knowledge bases .",
    "both parts , db and mdb communicate each other and the host computational environment of information system .",
    "the relative ideas were understood from 1987 in the nine known research projects of _ extensible _ database systems .",
    "de witt ( [ 1988 ] and later ) gave a brief comparison and further directions of the possible research .",
    "the main ideas were concentrated on a model of data .",
    "even the project without any pre - defined data model was proclaimed , but the desirable degree of flexibility was not achieved .",
    "the most prominent experiments with experimental ( object - oriented ) extensible system have used the molecular chaining of objects to avoid the known difficulties in designing and development .",
    "but the completed solution was not obtained neither in a theory nor in practice .",
    "the design of the systems which accumulate and process both information and metainformation does influence the effectiveness of information system , the efforts of its designing , maintenance , modifications and extensions .",
    "this results in the problem of designing the application development environment ( ade ) which communicates with the varying db and mdb .",
    "ade is both the research project and tool kit aimed at development of the mathematical apparatus , models and methods which being considered together comprise a variant of theory of computations for object - oriented programming technology , data base management systems and knowledge based systems .",
    "the research aims were establishing and experimental issues of some generic concepts in computer science : data object to represent the storable data ; metadata object to represent the conceptual information ; assignment to represent internal states and dynamics ; extensible database to represent relatively self - contained couples of objects and some additional derived concepts .",
    "all of these notions are important to succeed in ade development . at the present time in computer science",
    "there are proper means and methods to handle static application domains .",
    "and there is an appropriate mathematical apparatus as well .",
    "but the work with dynamic application domain is still a problem unsolved also in mathematical aspect .",
    "other aspect of the proposed research is to verify the feasibility of previously aimed generic concepts .",
    "thus the implementation of a prototype information system will assist in understanding the dynamics of data objects both within tool and applied ( programming of information ) system .",
    "ade has under research the idea of a concept as the variable entity to possess the creation of the variable concepts and associated transition effects . in their",
    "turn the variable concepts lead to parameterized type system . the approach developed in ade",
    "is based on the reasons stated . the usage of the method of embedding typed system ( including the apparatus of variable concepts ) into untyped system based on the apparatus of applicative computational systems ( acs ) is the distinctive feature of the approach being developed .",
    "combining the ideas of variable concepts will make possible development of a wide range of applied information systems , particularly in the field of data base management systems , knowledge based systems and programming systems .",
    "ade is viewed to be a comprehensive research as follows :    establishing the primitive frame to represent and analyze a ` variable concept ' ;    setting up the approach to integrate the far distant concepts , means and models from computer science branches ;    developing methods to adopt some intentional concepts of computer science that naturally result from the idea of ` variable concepts ' and their potential applications ;    creating the tool kit to explicate and apply the advantages of variable concepts ;    augmenting the possibilities of host programming system ;    specifying the enhanced data models ;    fixing the possible ranges of design and development those systems that involve the idea of data / metadata object ;    creating the generalized tool kit on the basis of the mathematical concepts in the current contribution .    the target prototype system application development environment ( ade ) is mainly based on the idea of variable , or switching concept and covers the vital mechanisms of encapsulation , inheritance and polymorphism .",
    "variable concepts naturally generate families of similar types that are derived from the generic types .",
    "concepts in ade are equipped with the evolvents that manage the transitions , or switching between the types .",
    "in particular , the identity evolvent supports the constant concepts and types ( statical concepts ) . to achieve the needed flexibility a general ade layout consists of the uniform modular units , as shown in fig .",
