    "the hires collaboration has recently released two measurements of the uhecr flux using monocular observations from its two sites@xcite .",
    "broken power law ( bpl ) fits made to these measurements can be used to identify features in the spectrum and to estimate their statistical significance in the data .",
    "all the fits presented in this paper are performed using the normalized binned maximum likelihood method@xcite .",
    "this method requires comparing the numbers of events expected in a given model to the number actually observed .",
    "the number of expected events is obtained from the predicted flux divided by the same exposure used to calculate the observed flux .",
    "the numbers of events observed by hires are shown in figure  [ fig : events ] .",
    "the binned maximum likelihood method also allows one to use bins in which there were no observed events , but in which events were expected .",
    "the result of the fits are expressed in terms of a quality - of - fit parameter @xmath3 which approaches a true @xmath3 in the limit of large numbers of events .",
    "the bpl fits are only made to bins above @xmath4 ev . while hires - ii does have three bins below this energy , these bins have poor statistics .",
    "we do nt fit these bins in order to avoid biases due to an expected change in the spectral slope , the second knee , at about this energy .",
    "parameters from fits to the hires monocular spectra to a bpl , @xmath5 , with zero , one and two floating break points are shown in table  [ brokenpowerlawfits ] . the result of the fit in the two floating break point case is shown in figure  [ hr12_trilinear_m05 ] .",

    ".[brokenpowerlawfits ] parameters found in broken power law fits to the hires monocular spectra . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the simple power law fit is clearly not a good fit . adding one floating break point gives a much better fit , and the break point finds the feature known as the ankle with a very high degree of statistical significance . adding a second floating break point improves the fit further .",
    "the break point is found to be at approximately the energy expected of the gzk suppression@xcite .",
    "the statistical significance of the second break in the spectrum can be estimated by looking at the reduction in the @xmath3 achieved by adding the break point , or by comparing the number of expected events above the second break point to what would be expected if the spectrum continued unabated above the second break point .",
    "the reduction of 16 in the @xmath3 for two additional degrees of freedom corresponds to just under 4@xmath6 significance in a gaussian fit . using the red line in figure  [ hr12_trilinear_m05 ]",
    ", one would expect to see 28.0 events , where 11 events were actually observed .",
    "the poisson probability of observing 11 events or fewer when expecting 28.0 is @xmath7 . for comparison ,",
    "the area in one tail of a gaussian distribution outside of 4@xmath6 ( 3@xmath6 ) is @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "so the significance of the high energy suppression is between 3@xmath6 and 4@xmath6 .",
    "berezinsky _ et al._@xcite have suggested measuring the energy of a break in the uhecr spectrum finding the energy , @xmath2 , at which the observed integral spectrum is half of what one would expect with no break . the integral spectrum measured by hires , along with the expected integral spectrum using the red line in figure  [ hr12_trilinear_m05 ] , is shown in figure  [ integral - spectrum ] .",
    "the ratio of the observed to the expected integral spectra is shown in figure  [ integral - ratio ] . by interpolating between the hires - i points in figure  [ integral - ratio ]",
    ", we find an experimental value of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 in ev ) .",

    "berezinsky _ et al._@xcite also calculate the energy loss rate for uhe protons traveling through the cosmic microwave background radiation , assuming continuous energy loss through electron pair production , pion production and universal expansion .",
    "this can be used to predict the observed spectrum of extragalactic protons for a given input spectrum .    since protons with energies above the pion production threshold lose energy in highly inelastic interactions",
    ", we have used the monte carlo method of demarco _",
    "et al._@xcite to model this part of the propagation of extragalactic protons .",
    "protons from a shell at a given redshift are propagated from generation to observation ( at @xmath14 ) .",
    "each input energy corresponds to a distribution of observed energies after such a propagation .",
    "this @xmath15@xmath16 distribution convolved with the input spectrum gives the observed spectrum for protons from sources at a given redshift .",
    "if the distribution of sources is assumed to be uniform at any given redshift , but to evolve with redshift as @xmath17 , one can combine the spectra from different shells as shown in for a coarse , logarithmic series of shells in figure  [ shell - series ] .    because the hires - ii spectrum extends to fairly low energies",
    ", one should take into account an additional galactic component when fitting to this usm model .",
    "we made the simple phenomenological assumption that the extragalactic and galactic components of the spectrum are expressed , respectively , in the light ( protons ) and heavy ( iron ) components of a composition measurement .",
    "we use fits to the hires prototype / mia@xcite and hires stereo@xcite composition measurements with respect to qgsjet proton and iron expectations to determine the relative sizes of the extragalactic and galactic components .",
    "then , for a given set of parameters for the extragalactic uhecr spectrum , we can add the appropriate galactic cosmic ray flux .",
    "we varied the input spectral slope , @xmath18 , and evolution parameter , @xmath19 , to find the best fit of the hires monocular data to this usm - plus - galactic model .",
    "the best fit spectrum is shown in figure  [ usm - best ] . the final result for",

    "the fit does not work as well in the region just below the gzk suppression .",
    "this could be due to some sources having a maximum energy below the gzk threshold .",
    "the is also little sign of a second knee at around @xmath4 ev , though the hires - ii data has little statistical power in this region .",
    "the hires detector has observed the ankle and has evidence for a suppression at higher energies above @xmath1 ev .",
    "the energy for this high energy suppression agrees with what is expected from the gzk suppression according to the @xmath2 test .",
