    "this was the starting point of various lines of research , which led to various unitarization and saturation models in which the triple @xmath0omeron vertex is a key building block .",
    "the _ generalized leading log approximation _ , which takes into account any _ fixed _ number @xmath3 of @xmath4-channel exchanged reggeons , leads to the bartels , jaroszewicz , kwiecinski , praszalowicz ( bjkp ) equation @xcite .",

    "it is is expected that the whole series , although divergent , could have a critical behavior with an odderon intercept @xmath11 .",

    "the dipole model @xcite , @xcite , equivalent to the bfkl equation at lla @xcite , is based on the description of the wave function of an onium state in terms of color dipole degrees of freedom in the t hooft limit and at large @xmath13 .",

    "the non - planar part of the triple @xmath0omeron vertex can not be derived from the dipole model since this approach relies on the large @xmath7 limit which suppresses all non - planar contributions .    since the time it became clear that at high - energy ( regge limit ) non - linear effects dominates the dynamics of the scattering processes , non - linear evolution equations were derived .",
    "one of these equations is the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation , derived first by balitsky @xcite in the wilson line formalism , and then by kovchegov @xcite in the dipole model .",
    "the wilson line formalism is an operator language .",
    "it is based on the concept of factorization of the scattering amplitude in rapidity space and on the extension to high - energy ( regge limit ) of the operator product expansion ( ope ) technique , which was known before only at moderate energy ( bjorken limit ) as an expansion in terms of local operators or in terms of light - ray operators . in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) off a hadron at high - energy , the matrix elements made of wilson line operators appearing in the ope ,",

    "the wilson - line operators evolve with respect to rapidity according to the balitsky equation , which reduces to the bk equation in the large @xmath7 limit .",
    "the bk equation describes the so called fan diagrams neglecting all non - planar contributions , while the balitsky equation gives one the possibility to describe the fan diagrams including also the non - planar contributions .",
    "a similar method to the background field technique is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors studied the propagation of a fast moving particle , and showed that resumming the emission of soft gluons from this source and neglecting its recoil ( eikonal approximation ) , one may obtain the bfkl equation .",
    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) is another available way to describe high - energy scattering processes .",
    "this approach is similar to the wilson line formalism described above , and the corresponding evolution equation is the jalilian - marian , iancu , maclerran , weigert , leonidov , and kovner ( jimwlk ) equation .",
    "indeed , the balitsky equation , as already mentioned above , is not a closed evolution equation , but it contains an infinite set of evolution equations which goes by the name of balitsky - hierarchy .",

    "the description of the scattering of two probes involves the computation of the interaction of one wilson loop describing one probe with the field of the other .",
    "note that within the dipole model , a similar approach , based on the computation of the scattering phase of a dipole in the field emmited by a fast moving object ( involving color structures as well as multicolor states ) , was suggested in ref .",
    ".    a further approach to the description of high - energy processes is based on an effective field theory .",
    "this formalism @xcite provides the building blocks ( reggeon - reggeon - gluon ) necessary to the explicit computation of any type of diagram at this regime .",
    "however , the precise relationship between this effective theory and the eglla approach has not been clarified yet , and explicit applications of this effective field theory is highly desirable @xcite .",
    "the triple @xmath0omeron vertex is the first non - trivial building block common to all the above approaches .",
    "it turns out that up to now , its exact expression , including planar and non - planar contribution , was derived only in the eggla approach @xcite . using its conformal invariance @xcite , both the planar and",
    "the non - planar contributions of the vertex were computed in the coordinate space @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for explicit expressions in the @xmath15 case ) .",
    "so far , only the planar contribution was derived with formalisms different from the eglla one .",
    "these are the dipole model @xcite and the wilson line formalism applied to diffractive processes @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that the exact expression of the 3 @xmath0omeron vertex ( planar and non - planar contributions ) can be easily derived through the wilson line formalism not only for diffractive case but also for fan diagrams .",
    "indeed , this formalism was already used to derive several new and desirable results , and to confirm others which have been derived after many years of calculations .",
    "this include for example the nlo bk kernel in qcd @xcite and in @xmath16=4 sym @xcite whose linearized version confirmed the nlo bfkl kernel in qcd @xcite and in @xmath16=4 sym @xcite .",
    "moreover , through wilson line formalism it was possible to derive for the first time the conformal expression for the nlo bfkl kernel @xcite , the full amplitude at nlo in @xmath16=4 sym for four scalar currents made of chiral - primary operator @xcite , and the analytic result for the nlo photon impact factor @xcite , relevant for phenomenology at high - energy , was recently derived .",
    "it is clear that the wilson line approach to the study of high - energy scattering processes opens the way to attack more difficult problems which have not been solved before despite the many efforts that have been devoted to them using different techniques .",
    "this includes for example multiple @xmath0omeron or @xmath17dderon vertices , as well as sub - leading contributions .",

    "@xcite this was already done for the case of diffractive processes using keldysh formalism , but the result obtained there was only for the planar part of the vertex . in section iii , we have shown how to compute also the non - planar contribution of the diffractive triple @xmath0omeron vertex from wilson line formalism . to this end we considered the generalization of the balitsky equation for diffractive process , and using the linearization procedure and the 2-gluon approximation , we have extracted the desired subleading term in @xmath7 of the vertex .",
    "in section iv we have extended the result of section iii to the more generic case of fan diagrams , where the @xmath0omeron , which split to two other ones , does not need to be at @xmath113 .",
    "we then showed that the triple pomeron vertex for fan diagrams is the same as the one obtained in the diffractive case .",
