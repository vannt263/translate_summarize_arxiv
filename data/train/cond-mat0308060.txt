    "surfactant  induced mesomorphic structures based on the association between flexible homopolymers and head  functionalized oligomers represent a new class of supramolecular materials .",

    "@xcite and theoreticians @xcite , @xcite .",
    "microphase separation is the principal property of such systems which results in the formation of ordered mesoscopic structures due to the association between the head group of the oligomer and corresponding groups of the homopolymer , on the one hand , and unfavorable polar  nonpolar interactions between the non  polar tail of the surfactant molecules and the rest of the system , on the other one .",
    "the homopolymer ",
    "oligomer systems involve two main classes that are relevant to strong ionic bonds and weak hydrogen ones .",
    "unlike to conventional copolymers where repulsive blocks are bonded together by covalent bonds , there are various temporary physical interactions which play a crucial role in the formation of ordered mesophases in such systems . in the ionic bonding systems",
    "the degree of association is relatively high , so that the polymer chain resembles a comb copolymer with regularly alternating oligomer side chains . at the same time , for the systems with temperature  dependent hydrogen bonds the incompatibility must not be so strong to induce separation on a macroscopic level . here , the microphase separation results in the periodic alternation of the layers of stretched homopolymer chains surrounded by perpendicularly oriented oligomer tails ( see figure [ structure ] ) .    similarly to the conventional copolymer systems , a rich variety of morphologies ( lamellar , cylindrical , spherical etc .",
    ") is shown to be possible @xcite .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity we will restrict ourselves with considering lamellar morphology only .",
    "an example of the ionic bonding systems is represented by the mixture p4vp(dbsa)@xmath0 of the homopolymer being atactic poly(4-vinyl pyridine ) ( p4vp ) and the surfactant as dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid ( dbsa ) . here , owing to the very strong interaction , the temperature domain of microphase separation is not bounded from above by association effects @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of the systems of this type , being polyelectrolyte  surfactant complexes , is that the long space structure period is an increasing function of the number oligomer / monomer ratio @xmath2 ( the number of dbsa  groups per one pyridine ring ) .",
    "more complicated behavior is inherent in the hydrogen bonded systems which were considered to study the opposite weak - bonding limit @xcite    @xcite .",
    "here , the weak interaction causes an order  disorder transition to homogeneous high  temperature state .",
    "an example of these systems is given by the mixture p4vp(pdp)@xmath0 of the same homopolymer p4vp with 3-pentadecyl phenol ( pdp ) being the oligomer .",
    "in this case , unlike to the ionic bonding systems , the long space period decreases with @xmath2increase . an intermediate behavior exhibit the system p4vp-(zn(dbs)@xmath1)@xmath0 with the oligomer being zinc dodecyl benzene sulfonate zn(dbs)@xmath1 that forms transition metal coordination complexes with the monomers of p4vp @xcite .",
    "ionic bond weakening due to the absence of covalently bound charges along the homopolymer chain leads here to a non  monotonic form of the @xmath2dependence of the long space period .",
    "principally important for our consideration is decreasing form of the temperature dependence of the long space period for all above systems @xcite  @xcite .",
    "however , such character of the dependence appears in hydrogen bonded systems only within a finite temperature interval bounded by the glass transition temperature @xmath3 from below and order  disorder transition temperature @xmath4 from above @xcite . here , an increase of the oligomer / monomer ratio @xmath2 leads to a non  monotonic behavior of the temperature @xmath4 with a maximum near the point @xmath5 , deviation from which narrows the temperature domain @xmath6 .",

    "it turned out that this approach gives the real dependence of the long space period @xmath13 of the ordered structure on the oligomer / monomer ratio in the system , however , as the fraction of hydrogen bonds monotonically decreases with temperature , the increasing temperature dependence of @xmath14 obtained is in contradiction to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "this inconsistency is caused obviously by the roughness of the random phase approximation used for description of the hydrogen bonding .    to avoid this limitation ,",
    "our approach is based on the above mentioned analogy between associating homopolymer ",
    "oligomer mixtures and random comb copolymers taking into account the varying number of oligomers attached to the main chain stochastically .",
    "such a system can be analysed in terms of the random walk statistics to apply the field theoretical scheme @xcite for the development of the microscopic theory .",
    "the corner stone of our approach lies in the assumption that the alternation of the homopolymer associative groups with and without oligomers attached is like the alternation of the segments of different types along the chains of a random heteropolymer to be represented as a stochastic variation of the ising spin , for which the role of imaginary time is played by the number of chain segment @xmath15 @xcite  @xcite .",
    "along this line , the problem under consideration is divided into two parts , the first of which is reduced to the determination of the relation between the long space period @xmath13 and the average fraction of hydrogen bonds @xmath11 , whereas the second one is focused on the determination of the frequency @xmath16 in the distribution of the oligomer heads along the homopolymer chain .",

    "the principal peculiarity of our approach lies in accounting of the inhomogeneity in the distribution of oligomers along the homopolymer chains .",

    "complication of the problem arising from the determination of the proper frequency @xmath19 is caused by an essential non  linearity and coupling the advanced / retarded green functions and the structure factor .",

    "to get rid of a misunderstanding , we would like to stress a composite character of the approach used .",

    "oligomer mixture , the second one @xmath9 is caused by the hydrogen bonding .",
    "these terms are caused by the interactions of principally different physical nature : the behavior of the mixture of non  associated homopolymers and oligomers is determined by the flory parameter @xmath84 , characterizing unfavorable interactions between the the oligomers and the rest of the system ; the temperature induced distribution of hydrogen bonds is determined by the parameter @xmath38 , giving the strength of this bonding . from the formal point of view , both of the above contributions @xmath85 and @xmath86 should have a similar dependencies on the state parameters being ( apart from the temperature ) the volume fraction of the homopolymer @xmath87 for the first contribution , and the oligomer / monomer ratio @xmath2 for the second one . because the term @xmath88 involves the parabolic dependence on the parameter @xmath87 bounded by maximal value @xmath89 , we took generalized parabolic approximation ( [ 61 ] ) for the dependence of the hydrogen bonding strength @xmath38 on the oligomer / monomer ratio @xmath2 which may take values @xmath90 .    apart from the above difference in nature of the interactions , one needs to emphasize at once the difference in the approaches used : the mixture of non  associated homopolymers and oligomers had been studied within the strong segregation limit @xcite , whereas for the consideration of the hydrogen bonding we use opposite approach .",
    "this difference is kept if the flory parameter takes large values @xmath91 , whereas the hydrogen bonding strength is relatively small ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "indeed , the formula ( [ 1 ] ) for the long space period was obtained within approximation of the sharp interface , which thickness is @xmath93 to be relevant to the strong segregation regime @xcite . in the consideration presented , we have focused mainly on the study of the hydrogen bonding on the base of the action ( [ 8 ] ) that has the form of series in powers of the order parameter @xmath59 and its derivatives @xmath94 . such an expansion supposes making use of the weak segregation limit corresponding to the small values of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath38 .    finally , it is worthwhile to discuss a difference with an usual picture of the phase transitions that is caused by the self  consistency condition ( [ 35 ] ) .",

    "action effects .",
    "the accounting of these effects arrives to replacement the bare parameter @xmath84 by the renormalized value @xmath96 @xcite .",

    "oligomer mixture is negligible small . as a result ,",
    "the role of @xmath84 passes to the hydrogen bonding parameter @xmath38 which does not relate to the tendency of monomers of the different kinds to avoid each other .",
    "however , as it is shown by the considerations given in @xcite , @xcite , understanding of the whole picture of microphase separation , including the temperature dependence of the structure period , demands accounting the inhomogeneity in the distribution of oligomers along homopolymer chains . within the approach developed , this is reached by means of the effective kinetic energy ( [ 6 ] ) , with the mass fluctuating due to the temperature dependence of hydrogen bonding .",
    "this dependence leads to the reduction ( [ 36 ] ) of the effective mass @xmath97 that causes a phase transition from stochastic to periodic distribution of the oligomers along the homopolymer chain .",
    "however , if the critical point is fixed usually by the condition @xmath98 @xcite , in our case the critical temperature @xmath4 relates to the finite magnitude @xmath99 of the effective mass which has a singularity @xmath100 in the temperature derivative ( see figure 2 ) .",
