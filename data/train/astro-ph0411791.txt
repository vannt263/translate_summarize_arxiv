    "observations show that a significant fraction , perhaps a majority , of agn of different types are obscured by a screen of a cold dusty matter , thought to be a molecular torus - like structure with a scale between 1 to a 100 parsec @xcite . moreover , many lines of observational evidence suggest that the unobscured agn have similar torii as well , but we are viewing these agn at an angle allowing a direct view of their central engines .",
    "the orientation - dependent obscuration is thus said to unify the different agn classes @xcite .    despite the observational importance ,",
    "the theory of molecular torii is still in an exploratory state , which is indicative of the difficulty of the problem .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that the large geometrical thickness of the torus and yet its apparently low temperature are consistent only if the torus is made of many molecular clouds moving with very high random velocities ( mach number @xmath1 ) . given that stellar feedback processes appear inefficient to explain these large random speeds , the authors were `` forced to seek a much more speculative solution : viscous heating of the cloud system due to partially elastic cloud - cloud collisions . ''",
    "however , until now there is no definitive answer ( via numerical simulations ) on whether clouds colliding at large mach numbers would behave even partially elastic , or would rather share and dump the random velocity component and collapse to a disk configuration .",
    "@xcite took a point with @xcite assertion of the weakness of the stellar processes .",
    "considering `` large '' , e.g. 100 parsec torii , and via numerical simulations of supernova explosions resulting from star formation in a self - gravitating , massive disk , they have shown that large random cold gas velocities result from the interaction of the gas with the supernova shells .",
    "however as such about @xmath2  % of the gaseous disk in the simulations is consumed in the star formation episode rather than being accreted by the black hole . unless most of the stars formed in the disk are later somehow accreted onto the smbh , this mechanism can only work for torii on scales much larger than the smbh gravitational sphere of influence , @xmath3 , i.e. where the stellar mass is much greater than @xmath4 .",
    "it is also not clear whether this mechanism would work for smaller accretion / star formation rates because then supernova explosions become too rare .",
    "finally , time variability of obscuring column depths argues for much smaller radial sizes of the `` torus '' , e.g. in the range @xmath5 parsec @xcite .",
    "here we would like to emphasize that accretion disks in agn are very unlikely to be planar .",
    "there are several mechanisms that are capable of producing strong warps .",
    "we believe that such warps have to be an integral part of the agn obscuration puzzle .",
    "in particular , we shall describe and calculate a disk warping mechanism driven by an axi - symmetric gravitational potential .",
    "the sequence of events that takes place in an agn feeding cycle in our model is as following .",
    "first of all , a merger with another galaxy or a satellite , or another source of cold gas , fills the inner part of the galaxy with plenty of gas .",
    "this gas will in general have a significant angular momentum oriented practically _",
    "randomly_. the gas will start settling in a disk that is too massive and too cold to be stable against self - gravity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "stars are formed inside the accretion disk , producing a flat stellar system .",
    "this long - lived axi - symmetric ( or perhaps also warped ) structure will torque any orbit which is not exactly co - planar with it , resulting in a precession around the symmetry axis .",
    "now , as the time goes on , the orientation of the angular momentum vector of the incoming gas changes , and the newly built disk is exposed to the torque from the stellar disk remnant .",
    "different rings of the disk precess at different rates , thus the disk becomes warped .",
    "we shall emphasize that existence of these stellar disk remnants is hardly a question based on the severe self - gravity problems for the standard accretion disks at large radii .",
    "the recent observational evidence supports this conclusion too .",
    "the best known example of such flat stellar systems is in our galactic center @xcite where two young stellar rings are orbiting the smbh only a tenth of a parsec away .",
    "the orbital planes of these rings are oriented at very large angles to the galactic plane .",
    "such flat stellar systems are also being found elsewhere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the linear gravitational warping effect to investigate its main features . taking the simplest case of a warp produced by a massive ring",
    ", we calculate the gravitational warping torque . starting from a thin test accretion disk ,",
    "we calculate its time dependent shape . under quite realistic assumptions ,",
    "the disk becomes strongly warped in some @xmath6 orbital times , i.e. in @xmath7 years .",
    "since the warping is gravitational in nature , gaseous and clumpy molecular disks alike are subject to such deformations .",
    "we speculate that in the non - linear stage of the effect , a clumpy warped disk will form a torus - like structure .",
    "the basic physics of the effect is very simple and has been explained by e.g. , @xcite in his consideration of the galactic warps ( most galactic disks are somewhat warped ) .",
    "consider a nearly circular orbit of radius @xmath8 for a test particle in an axi - symmetric potential ( e.g. a central point mass plus a flat disk ) .",
    "let the axis @xmath9 to be perpendicular to the plane of the disk .",
    "the particle makes radial and vertical oscillations with slightly different frequencies , and the difference is the precession frequency , @xmath10 . due to the symmetry , the @xmath9-projection of the angular momentum of the particle is exactly conserved ( see , e.g. ,  3.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "thus the angle between the angular momentum of the particle and the @xmath9-axis , @xmath11 , is a constant .",
    "the line of the nodes ( the line over which the two planes intersect ) , however , precesses .    now consider a `` test - particle '' disk initially in the same plane as the circular orbit .",
    "the disk is a collection of rings , i.e. circular orbits .",
    "since precession rates @xmath10 are different for different @xmath8 , rings turn around the @xmath9-axis on unequal angles .",
    "the initially flat disk will be warped with time .",
    "let us calculate the gravitational torque between two rings with radii @xmath12 and @xmath8 , inclined at angle @xmath11 with respect to each other .",
    "we work in two rigid coordinate systems , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , centers of which are at the smbh . for convenience ,",
    "we place the first ring in the @xmath15 plane , whereas the second ring is at @xmath16 plane .",
    "angle @xmath11 is obviously the angle between the axes @xmath9 and @xmath17 .",
    "further , the axes @xmath18 and @xmath19 are chosen to coincide with the line of the nodes .    the total torque exerted by the second ring on the first one is @xmath20}{|\\vec{r } - \\vec{r}_1|^{3}}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the masses of the two rings , respectively .",
    "the integration goes over angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 that are azimuthal angles in the respective frames of the rings . from this expression",
    "it is immediately clear that co - planar rings do not exert any torque on each other , @xmath27=0 $ ] .",
    "in addition , if @xmath28 , the integral vanishes as well because for each @xmath29 the opposites sides of the second ring ( e.g. @xmath26 and @xmath30 ) make equal but opposing contributions .",
    "it is also possible to show that due to symmetry the torque s @xmath9-projection vanish .",
    "thus we only have the @xmath31 component , meaning that the angular momentum vector of the ring will rotate without changing its magnitude . also , if @xmath32 , then one can neglect warping of the first ring .    the absolute distance between two ring elements with the respective angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 is @xmath33 ^ 2 = r_1 ^ 2 + r^2 -2 r_1 r \\cos\\lambda\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 without going into tedious detail , we write the torque expression separating out the leading radial dependence and the integral over angles , which we label @xmath35 : @xmath36 with @xmath37^{3/2 } } \\label{i}\\ ] ] and @xmath38    total angular momentum of the second ring is @xmath39 . recall that @xmath40  const , whereas the component of @xmath41 in the plane of the first ring ( @xmath15 ) precesses . we chose it to be initially in the @xmath42-direction , so that @xmath43 ( cf .",
    "equation [ defl ] below ) .",
    "the precession frequency for the second ring is then @xmath44    in general , the integral in equation [ i ] is calculated numerically , but for @xmath45 one can decompose @xmath46^{-3/2 } \\approx 1 + 3/2 \\delta\\cos\\lambda$ ] and obtain @xmath47 .",
    "when this approximation holds , that is when @xmath48 or @xmath49 , the precession frequency for the second ring is @xmath50^{5/2}}\\;. \\label{omegapa}\\ ] ]    few estimates can now be made .",
    "first of all , @xmath10 reaches a maximum at radius @xmath51 at which @xmath52 .",
    "the maximum growth rate of the warp is thus @xmath53 @xmath54 may be expected on the order of a percent or so since this is when the accretion disks become self - gravitating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the resulting stellar mass would probably be of that order too . in this case one",
    "notices that to produce a sufficiently large warp one has to wait for at least @xmath55 or @xmath56 orbital times at the radius of the maximum warp @xmath51 . while this is a fairly long time , it is still much shorter than the corresponding disk viscous time ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the assimptotic dependence of precession frequency on radius @xmath8 is @xmath57 a thin massive stellar ring would thus only warp a range of radii , leaving the portions of the disk much internal and also much external to it unaffected .",
    "we now want to calculate the shape of a light non self - gravitating disk warped by a massive ring @xmath12 .",
    "the disk is treated as a collection of rings with different radii @xmath8 and negligible mass .",
    "we assume that the mass of the whole disk , @xmath24 , is negligible in comparison with the mass of the ring , @xmath58 , and that therefore the massive ring s orientation ( angular momentum ) does not change with time .    in application to the real disks",
    ", it should be remembered that any attempt to warp a disk will be resisted by disk viscous forces ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that transfer the angular momentum through the disk . however , we are interested in the outermost regions of agn accretion disks where they `` connect '' to the galaxy . on these",
    ", a tenth of a parsec to 100 parsec scales ( the range depends on @xmath4 ) , the usual @xmath0-disk viscosity @xcite becomes ineffective .",
    "the viscous time scale becomes too long and the disks are believed to be prone to self - gravity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore we are justified in neglecting the restoring viscous forces .",
    "a much more important effect will be the restoring force from the self - gravity of the disk that is being warped , but we differ the study of this and other non - linear effects to a future paper .",
    "it is convenient to work with angle @xmath11 , already introduced , and one additional angle , @xmath59 .",
    "recall that angle @xmath11 is the local angle of the ring s tilt to the @xmath9-axis and it remains constant in the test particle regime .",
    "angle @xmath59 is needed to introduce the projections of the unit tilt vector normal to the ring , @xmath60 , on the @xmath18 and @xmath42 axes @xcite : @xmath61 angle @xmath59 therefore describes the precession of each ring around the @xmath9-axis . with the chosen coordinate system , at time @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( and we get , in accord with conventions of  [ sec : rings ] , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) .",
    "as each of the disk rings precesses , @xmath66    it is useful to write the expression for the unit tilt vector in the @xmath67 coordinate system rigidly bound to the initial disk plane : @xmath68 note that if @xmath69 , @xmath70 , e.g. the rings are never tilted with respect to the @xmath71 axis , as it should .",
    "also , when @xmath63 , @xmath72 indeed coincides with the @xmath17-axis , i.e. the disk is flat .    using equations [ deflpx]-[deflpz ]",
    ", we can now calculate the shape of the warped disk in that system given the function @xmath73 . to accomplish this ,",
    "one first introduces the azimuthal angle @xmath26 on the surface of the ring .",
    "the coordinates of the points on the ring , @xmath74 , are then given by equations 2.2 and 2.3 in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding coordinates in the primed system of reference are easily obtained by @xmath75 , etc . , where @xmath76 and so on are the unit coordinate vectors of the primed system .",
    "the result is : @xmath77\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      to illustrate the results , we calculate the precession rates @xmath78 for the following case , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting shape of the disk in the original un - warped disk plane is plotted in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the time is in units of @xmath82 at @xmath83 , i.e. @xmath84 corresponds to time @xmath85 years , where @xmath86 is the distance in units of parsec and @xmath87 .",
    "note that the warp is strongest around radius @xmath88 , as expected .",
    "the inner disk is hardly tilted , which is not surprising given that @xmath89 for small @xmath8 ( equation [ ass1 ] ) .",
    "same is true for the outer radii , where the small tilt of the original plane can be seen on the edges of the disk ( we do not calculate the tilt beyond @xmath90 and hence the original disk plane is still seen on the edges of the figure ) .",
    "we believe that the gravitational disk warping due to non - spherical mass distribution within the smbh sphere of influence is a common occurrence in real agn .",
    "it is hard to see why agn disks should always form in one plane and even why they should be planar when they are born @xcite .",
    "the time scales for development of strong warps are short or comparable to characteristic agn lifetimes ( which are thought to be in the range of @xmath91 years ) . we thus expect that the outer edges of the disk will obscure a significant fraction of the sky as seen from the central source and hence be directly relevant to the unification schemes of agn @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the warped disk surface from figure [ fig : fig1 ] at different times as seen from the origin of coordinates .",
    "the vertical axis shows @xmath92 and the horizontal one shows @xmath26 defined previously .",
    "the shape of the disk at different times is shown with different colors . at time",
    "@xmath62 the disk is flat and its projection is simply @xmath93 for all @xmath26 . at later times the rings of the disk near @xmath94 precess and bulge out of the initial disk plane . with time",
    "the fraction of the sky obscured from the central engine becomes greater than a half .",
    "in reality non - linear effects and interaction of the disk with agn winds and radiation , etc .",
    ", will become important in shaping the disk for significant warps .      in general ,",
    "the non - linear stage of the evolution of the system of disks or rings of stars and molecular gas is far from a thin disk as long as collisions are of minor importance .",
    "we have already explored the non - linear evolution of collisionless systems with n - body codes and the results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "when two massive disks warp each other , mixing occurs when @xmath95 becomes large , and the resulting configuration reminds that of a torus .",
    "now , inelastic dissipative collisions between gas clumps will eventually become important .",
    "relaxation of a collisionless n - body system leads to non - circular orbits , and hence different disk rings will start to overlap .",
    "collisions should then tend to destroy the random motions and should establish a common disk `` plane '' .",
    "however , such a disk will normally be warped itself .",
    "therefore inelastic dissipative collisions do not necessarily turn off the obscuration in our model . further ,",
    "if molecular gas clumps are constantly supplied from the outside and come with fluctuating angular momentum , the disk may never arrive in a flat thin configuration ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite convincingly argued that the agn obscuring medium must not be uniform in density .",
    "this does not contradict our model at all since agn accretion disks on large ( e.g. 0.1 pc and beyond ) scales are self - gravitating unless the accretion rates are tiny ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the source of warping potential does not have to be a thin stellar ring or a disk : it may be any non - spherical distribution of stars in the smbh vicinity that retains a non - zero quadrupole moment ; it can also be a second ( smaller ) super - massive black hole during a merger of two galaxies .",
    "both the collision - dominated @xcite and the stellar - feedback inflated torii @xcite share a common starting point : the torus is the result of some internal disk physics .",
    "if our interpretation applies , agn torii lend their existence to the way in which the cold gas arrives in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "compared with the model of @xcite , large random speeds for the cold gas are not required in our model .",
    "although the gas may be quite high up away from the original plane of the disk , the disk is locally coherent and thin .",
    "high speed elastic collisions between molecular clouds are thus not needed to explain obscuration of agn in our model .",
    "there are also two other mechanisms potentially able to produce warped disks at parsec and beyond scales around agn .",
    "as mentioned in the x - ray binaries context , accretion disks develop twists and warps due to instabilities driven by x - ray heated wind off the disk surface @xcite .",
    "same can be achieved by the radiation pressure force from the central source @xcite .",
    "however , it seems that the majority of disks in x - ray binaries are either not warped or warped not strongly enough @xcite to provide the large obscuration needed for the agn unification schemes .",
    "in contrast , the warping mechanism discussed here is not applicable to x - ray binary systems , and hence it may be natural that agn disks are stronger warped than x - ray binary disks on appropriately scaled distances from the center .",
    "the two young stellar disks discovered recently in sgr  a@xmath96  present a challenge to the usual star formation modes because the gas densities required to avoid tidal shearing are many orders of magnitude larger than the highest densities observed anywhere in the galactic molecular clouds . on the other hand , star formation inside a massive accretion disk is a long expected outcome of the self - gravitational instability of such disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as such , the young stars in the sgr  a@xmath96  star cluster therefore are a first example of star formation in this extreme environment .",
    "it is very likely that the star formation efficiency and the initial mass function ( imf ) are quite different in the immediate agn vicinity and elsewhere in a galaxy .",
    "the `` astro - archeology '' of sgr  a@xmath96  can be used to study these issues .    the gravitational warping effect discussed in this paper",
    "constrains the time - averaged mass of the outer ring , @xmath97 , since the moment of its creation , assumed to be @xmath98 years .",
    "the inner stellar ring is rather well defined @xcite , and we thus estimate @xmath99 for the inner ring to be smaller than @xmath100 . taking the radius of the inner stellar ring to be @xmath101 for the gc black hole , and for the outer , @xmath102 , and using equation [ omegapa ] with @xmath103 , one obtains @xmath104 .",
    "preliminary numerical n - body simulations show this limit may be even smaller .",
    "there are clearly other observational implications of gravitationally warped disks .",
    "for example , narrow fe k@xmath0  lines , observed in many seyfert galaxies , can be explained with x - ray reflection off such warped cold disks .",
    "in addition , warped disks will yield different coherent paths for maser amplification than flat disks do , which may be a part of the explanation for the complexity of the observed agn maser emission .",
    "we argued that clumpy self - gravitating accretion disks in agn are generically strongly warped .",
    "we believe such warping should be an integral part of the explanation for the agn unification schemes .",
    "our model provides arguably the easiest way to obscure the central engine without the need to lift cold gas clouds off the disk plane high up via elastic collisions , supernova explosions or winds .",
