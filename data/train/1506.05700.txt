    "quantization of electronic motion by a strong magnetic field leads to many qualitatively new effects .",
    "they are most pronounced in two - dimensional systems , where the motion along the field is frozen by quantum confinement , so the continuous electronic spectrum is transformed into a series of discrete landau levels ( lls ) .",
    "probably the most famous examples of such new effects are the integer and the fractional quantum hall effects  @xcite , which arise because the degenerate electronic states on a ll are profoundly modified by disorder or lateral confinement potential , and by electron - electron interaction , respectively .",
    "electron - phonon coupling can also produce new effects , especially when the energy of an inter - ll excitation matches that of an optical phonon .",
    "such resonances may lead to strong - coupling effects even if the electron - phonon coupling in the absence of the magnetic field was weak .",
    "magneto - phonon resonances were first discussed theoretically in relation to the dc electron transport in doped bulk semiconductors subject to a strong magnetic field where the resonance leads to an enhancement of the electron - phonon scattering rate  @xcite .",
    "they were later observed experimentally in insb  @xcite .",
    "a doublet structure was observed in the infrared absorption spectrum of bulk insb in a magnetic field , which was attributed to the resonant coupling of an electronic excitation , the cyclotron resonance mode , to optical phonons , when tuned in resonance  @xcite .",
    "this is a strong - coupling effect , whose detailed theory was presented in ref .",
    "later , it was suggested that such magneto - phonon resonance need not be restricted to doublets : three branches of excitations involving zero , one , and two phonons may also cross at the same value of the magnetic field , resulting in a triplet structure of the absorption peak  @xcite .",
    "in fact , equidistancy of lls for electrons with parabolic bands leads to a rich variety of possible resonant combinations  @xcite .",
    "still , we are not aware of any observation of a resonant splitting of more than two excitation branches in conventional semiconductors .",
    "graphene , with its conical electron dispersion and exceptional crystal quality , opens new possibilities for observation of fundamental physical effects . in a magnetic field",
    "@xmath1 , perpendicular to the crystal plane , the ll energies are @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the landau level index , @xmath4 is the dirac velocity , and @xmath5 is the magnetic length . due to the @xmath6 dependence ,",
    "the spacing between lls with small @xmath7 is larger than for electrons with parabolic spectrum , which enabled the observation of the quantum hall effect at room temperature  @xcite , unprecedented in conventional semiconductor structures .",
    "magnetophonon resonances have been observed in raman scattering on optical phonons  @xcite , where the raman g  peak acquired a doublet structure .",
    "here , we report an observation of magnetophonon resonances where the triple peak structure is clearly seen . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", it is the first observation of such resonances in solid - state physics .    despite the generality of the observed magnetophonon resonance effects",
    ", graphene introduces some qualitatively new aspects .",
    "first , electronic bands in graphene are conical rather than parabolic , so the lls are not equally spaced in energy .",
    "this leads to a classification of possible resonant combinations which is quite different from that in conventional semiconductors .",
    "such classification for graphene is developed below .",
    "second , while in an undoped semiconductor all lls in the conduction band are empty , and those in the valence band are completely filled , in graphene there is always a partially filled ll ( unless the magnetic field is tuned to some special values ) ; if this partially filled level is involved in the resonance , the physics of the electron - phonon coupling is changed significantly .",
    "namely , it turns out that the multiple - peak structure can not be viewed as a resonant splitting of a few discrete levels ; one has to face a true many - body problem , so the peak splitting is necessarily accompanied by a broadening of a similar magnitude , and complicated spectral shapes may be produced .",
    "this physics was overlooked in the previous theoretical studies of magneto - phonon resonances in graphene  @xcite .",
    "our experiments are performed on extremely pure flakes of graphene which can be found on the surface of bulk graphite @xcite . to probe the magnetophonon resonances , we use raman scattering , which is a powerful and popular tool for characterization of graphene @xcite .",
    "inter - ll electronic excitations can be observed in the raman spectrum of graphene  @xcite , and the strongest features are due to transitions @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "in addition , transitions @xmath9 are also observed  @xcite even though theory predicts them to be weaker  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we trace the evolution of inter - ll excitations in graphene on graphite in magnetic fields up to @xmath10  t. such fields are needed to tune the inter - ll excitation energies across the energies of optical phonons and their combinations .",
    "we observe different series of magnetophonon resonances , involving both phonons from the vicinity of the @xmath11 and @xmath0 points of the first brillouin zone .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the filled red circle represents the excited electron , the empty red circle represents the hole , and the wavy line represents the phonon .",
    ", width=302 ]    in the following , we use a shorthand notation @xmath12 for an excitation of an electron from a filled level @xmath13 to an empty level  @xmath14 ( assuming that the partially filled level is @xmath15 ) . to gain a qualitative insight into various resonant processes , it is instructive to analyze the weak coupling limit first .",
    "namely , consider an initial excitation which was created in the sample in the course of raman scattering , and analyze different channels of decay for this excitation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] ) .",
    "one case is when the initial excitation is a phonon ; for example , the doubly degenerate @xmath16 phonon with the wave vector at the @xmath0 point of the first brillouin zone , giving rise to the @xmath17  peak in the raman spectrum .",
    "it may decay into an electronic inter - ll excitation , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay](a ) .",
    "the selection rule for the matrix element is @xmath18 , so the phonon decay rate is strongly enhanced when the phonon is resonant with one of the corresponding transitions , that is , the phonon energy @xmath19 for some  @xmath7 .",
    "this case corresponds to the magneto - phonon resonance in the raman scattering on phonons , which was observed experimentally @xcite , following the theoretical prediction in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on a different case , that of the initial excitation being an inter - ll excitation which decays into a phonon and another inter - ll excitation .",
    "again , the corresponding decay rate is enhanced at resonance , but the resonance condition is different from the previous case .",
    "for example , if the initial excitation is @xmath20 , it can decay if the electron on the level @xmath7 or the hole on the level @xmath13 emits a phonon and moves to another level @xmath21 or @xmath22 , respectively ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the decay is resonant if the phonon energy @xmath24 .",
    "it is essentially the same process that is responsible for the magneto - phonon resonance in electronic transport in semiconductors @xcite , as well as in magneto - optical absorption  @xcite .",
    "the role of momentum conservation is quite different in the two processes .",
    "as we focus here on optical excitation , the momentum of the incident and scattered photons can be neglected , so in both cases , the total momentum of the initial excitation is zero",
    ". if the initial excitation is a single phonon , it can be only the @xmath16 optical phonon from the @xmath0  point , and the total momentum of the inter - ll excitation into which it decays should also be zero , which leads to the selection rule @xmath18 , and thus restricts this case to the magneto - phonon resonance studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . for a multi - phonon initial excitation",
    ", one can also think about the resonant enhancement of the phonon decay rate ; however , the width of the multi - phonon raman peaks is dominated by other factors than the phonon decay  @xcite , so the modification of latter by the magnetic field is not observed in the raman spectra .    for an initial electronic inter - ll excitation of zero total momentum ,",
    "the momentum conservation allows the decay into a phonon with an arbitrary momentum and another inter - ll excitation with the opposite momentum .",
    "still , the matrix element is strongly suppressed unless the phonon momentum is within @xmath25 from the @xmath0  or @xmath26  points of the first brillouin zone .",
    "thus , one has to consider two kinds of resonances : ( i )  those involving the @xmath16 optical phonons around the @xmath0  point and intravalley electronic inter - ll excitations , and ( ii )  those involving intervalley inter - ll excitations and phonons around the @xmath26 points . among the latter phonons , those most strongly coupled to the electrons are the @xmath27 transverse optical phonons .",
    "the corresponding phonon energies are @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] ) . another important consequence of finite phonon momenta ( @xmath25 ) involved in the process , is the absence of any selection rule on the ll indices . in the above example of the decay of the @xmath20 excitation into a phonon and the @xmath30 , any @xmath21 is allowed ( energy conservation requires @xmath23 ) .",
    "the above discussion of decay of the initial excitation is valid in the limit when the electron - phonon coupling is weak compared to the typical broadening of the landau levels or to the dispersion of optical phonons or inter - ll excitations on the momentum scale @xmath25 . in the opposite limiting case , the problem corresponds to the coupling between discrete energy levels , when the states become strongly mixed .",
    "the energies of these hybrid excitations ( magnetopolarons ) exhibit an anticrossing as a function of the magnetic field as the latter is swept through the resonance region .    for an initial electronic inter - ll excitation ,",
    "different types of resonances are possible .",
    "a resonance occurs when the phonon energy @xmath31 matches the energy difference between some empty landau levels : @xmath32 for some @xmath33 ( we assume to be at zero temperature and zero doping , so @xmath15 is the only partially filled level ) . due to electron - hole symmetry , @xmath34 , eq .",
    "( [ resonance= ] ) automatically yields a similar condition for two filled levels , @xmath35 .",
    "also , because of the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath36 , the lls are not equidistant , but still , some additional degeneracies may arise .",
    "for example , if @xmath37 , this automatically yields @xmath38 , while if @xmath39 , there are no additional degeneracies .",

    "the filled red circles represent the excited electrons , the vertical arrows show their transitions which are resonant with a phonon .",
    ", width=188 ]    all resonances of the kind ( [ resonance= ] ) can be classified into three groups , depending on whether the ratio @xmath48 is integer , rational , or irrational ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : resonances ] ) .",
    "let us see what happens in each of these cases , restricting our attention to the initial excitations of the type @xmath20 , which dominate the electronic raman scattering in the magnetic field @xcite , and to @xmath49 ( as well as its electron - hole - symmetric counterpart @xmath50 ) , which are also observed in the raman spectra , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] .",
    "( i )  if @xmath51 is irrational , the resonances do not proliferate .",
    "then the simplest case is that of the initial @xmath49 excitation which is resonant with @xmath52 plus one phonon . in this case , there are no hole resonances ; indeed , @xmath53 at the same time would imply @xmath54 for some @xmath55 , which is impossible due to the concavity of the square root .",
    "the symmetric excitation @xmath20 is then resonant with @xmath30 ( or @xmath56 ) plus one phonon , but also with @xmath57 plus two phonons , i.  e. the electron and the hole resonances necessarily occur simultaneously .",
    "as the excitations with zero , one , and two phonons disperse differently with the magnetic field , the symmetric excitation gives a triple anticrossing of the levels as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "such triple anticrossings were discussed long ago in the context of optical magnetoabsorption in bulk semiconductors @xcite .",
    "( ii )  let @xmath51 be rational but not an integer , and let @xmath14  be the integer part of  @xmath51 . in this case , condition  ( [ resonance= ] ) yields not just one , but @xmath14  resonances .",
    "indeed , for any @xmath58 the energy @xmath59 matches the energy @xmath60 of the level @xmath61 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the last level in this sequence has the energy @xmath62 , which does not allow for emission of any more phonons .",
    "however , if we construct @xmath63 ^ 2 $ ] , then it turns out that @xmath64 , or , equivalently , @xmath65 .",
    "this means that the phonon itself is resonantly hybridized with the electronic excitation from the filled level @xmath66 to the empty level @xmath67 ( as the phonon involved has a finite wave vector , there are no selection rules on @xmath68 ) .",
    "thus , the asymmetric excitation @xmath69 is resonant with @xmath70 plus @xmath71 phonons for any @xmath72 , so we have an anticrossing of @xmath73 energy levels with different dispersions ( the hybridization of the phonon with @xmath74 or @xmath75 does not add anything , as these electronic excitations disperse with the magnetic field in the same way as @xmath76 ) .",
    "the symmetric excitation @xmath20 can resonantly emit phonons both on the electron and hole sides , up to @xmath77 phonons in total , corresponding to the anticrossing of @xmath78 levels .",
    "it is important that for non - integer  @xmath51 none of the resonances involve the partially filled @xmath15 landau level .",
    "( iii )  if @xmath79 , an integer , then the last term of the sequence @xmath80 from the previous case is @xmath81 .",
    "the resonance counting is analogous to case  ( ii ) .",
    "namely , we have @xmath73  anticrossings for the asymmetric initial excitation @xmath69 and @xmath78 anticrossings for @xmath20 , so that the latter can thus be entirely transformed into @xmath77  phonons by a sequence of resonant transitions . however , involvement of the partially filled @xmath15 level brings about a qualitatively new feature : the possibility of creation of an arbitrary number of zero - energy electronic excitations on the partially filled level . as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theoryiii ] , this feature makes a consistent theoretical treatment of case  ( iii ) quite problematic .    our experimental results , presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , include a clear observation of several resonances of type ( iii ) with double and , for the first time , triple avoided crossings .",
    "near each avoided crossing , we describe our data phenomenologically by an effective two- or three - level model with some coupling between the resonant excitations .",
    "we also observe some signatures of resonances of type  ( i ) , which are , however , close to the limits of our experimental resolution , and they do not allow for a quantitative anlysis .",
    "resonances of type ( ii ) are quite difficult to observe , as the smallest landau level indices @xmath82 which produce non - integer rational  @xmath51 are @xmath83 , @xmath84 , leading to @xmath85 .",
    "the corresponding magnetic field is too low , and the landau levels involved in the electronic excitation are too high , to be resolved in our experiment .    the theory for all three cases is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "its main task is to justify ( or disprove ) the phenomenological description of each avoided crossing by an effective few - level model .",
    "clearly , such description may be correct only if one can neglect the energy dispersion of the electronic excitations and of the phonons .",
    "the former can be neglected if the coulomb interaction is sufficiently weak ( e.g. , due to screening by the conducting graphite substrate ) . as for the latter",
    ", one should recall that the most important contribution to the dispersion of phonons near the @xmath0 or @xmath11 points comes from their coupling to the dirac electrons which produces the kohn anomaly  @xcite . in a strong magnetic field",
    "the spectrum of dirac electrons is quantized , so the main effect of the electron - phonon coupling is to induce magneto - phonon resonances .",
    "the residual part of the phonon dispersion which is due to interaction with electrons in the @xmath86  bands is quite weak and can indeed be neglected , as the relevant scale of the phonon wave vectors is quite small , @xmath87 ( @xmath88  is the magnetic length ) .",
    "still , it turns out , that even if one starts from dispersionless excitations , energy dispersion can be eventually generated due to resonant coupling .",
    "this effect is especially dramatic for case  ( iii ) , where plenty of zero - energy excitations are available on the partially filled @xmath15 landau level . as a result ,",
    "the splitting between the energies of the coupled excitations is accompanied by a broadening , whose magnitude is of the same order as the splitting .",
    "the broadened peaks have complicated spectral shapes , not described by any simple functional form , such as lorentzian , gaussian , or any other ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrint ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : theoryiii ] for an example ) .",
    "thus , the phenomenological description of our experimental data by effective two- or three - level models is very approximate .",
    "the splitting of the @xmath89 electronic excitation , observed when it is in resonance with the @xmath0  point phonon near @xmath90  t @xcite , can be ascribed to either of the two types of resonances mentioned in the beginning of this section .",
    "indeed , on the one hand , it can be viewed as the decay of the initial phonon into an electronic excitation . on the other hand",
    ", it can also be viewed as the decay of the initial @xmath89 electronic excitation into a phonon and a zero - energy @xmath91 excitation , falling into case  ( iii ) above . due to such `` double - faced '' nature of this particular resonance ,",
    "the split peaks are strongly broadened .",
    "this intrinsic broadening is missing in the simple description of refs .",
    "for the resonance between the @xmath11  point phonon and the @xmath89 excitation , coupling to an external continuum of states was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the strong broadening of the peaks ; here we see that the broadening , in fact , originates from the electron - phonon coupling itself , and there is no need to invoke any extrinsic effects .",
    "the broadening effects are less dramatic in the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "as discussed above , case  ( ii ) necessarily involves landau levels with quite large @xmath92 .",
    "this strongly suppresses the broadening effect : the main peaks are narrow and they contain the most of the spectral weight ( sec .  [ sec : theoryii ] ) . in case  ( i ) , discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssec : irrational ] , for asymmetric transitions @xmath69 no broadening is generated at all , so their resonance with @xmath93 and a phonon can be faithfully described by an effective two - level model .",
    "no broadening arises also for symmetric transitions @xmath20 resonating with @xmath30 and the @xmath11  point phonon , so the effective three - level description is justified . however ,",
    "if @xmath0  point phonons are involved in the resonance , broadening is generated due to a peculiar phonon exchange effect : the phonons emitted by @xmath94 and @xmath95 excitations which constitute the initial @xmath20 excitation , can be reabsorbed in the opposite order ; this is impossible for the @xmath11  point phonons as the two emitted phonons must necessarily belong to the opposite valleys .",
