    "massive magnetic monopoles ( @xmath0 gev ) are predicted by all grand unified theories of the electroweak and strong interactions ( guts ) @xcite .",
    "they could carry a magnetic charge @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an integer and @xmath3 is the elementary magnetic charge predicted by dirac @xcite .",
    "they should have been produced very early in the big bang universe and should have cooled to very low velocities since then .",
    "macro ( monopole , astrophysics and cosmic ray observatory ) @xcite is a large area underground experiment operating at laboratori nazionali del gran sasso , italy , at an average depth of 3700 hg/@xmath4 .",
    "it has a modular structure and three types of subdetectors : streamer tubes , liquid scintillators and nuclear track detectors ( cr39 and lexan ) .",
    "the track - etch system is distribuited on three ortogonal planes for a total area of 1263 m@xmath5 .",
    "in this paper the calibration , the charge resolution and the results of the magnetic monopole ( mm ) search using the macro cr39 as a ",
    "stand alone detector \" are discussed . in particular",
    ", the attention is focused on the experimental procedure of the search for magnetic monopoles : the etching conditions and the methods of searching for candidate events . in absence of candidates ,",
    "an updated estimate of the upper limits for an isotropic flux of monopoles with magnetic charge @xmath6 and for monopole - proton ( m+p ) composites established by the macro nuclear track detector is also presented .",
    "the macro cr39 is manufactured by the intercast europe company of parma ( italy ) .",
    "the standard cr39 , used mainly for sun glasses , was improved in order to achieve a lower detection threshold , a higher sensitivity in a large range of energy losses , a high quality of the post - etched surfaces after prolonged etching , stability of the sensitivity of the polymer over long periods of time and uniformity of sensitivity @xcite .",
    "when a heavily ionizing particle crosses a nuclear track detector foil , it produces damages at the level of molecular bonds , forming the so called  latent track \" . during the chemical etching of the detector in a basic water solution , as the etching velocity along the  latent track \" , @xmath7 , is larger than that for the bulk material , @xmath8 , etch - pit cones are formed on both sides of the foil , see fig .",
    "[ fig : funzionamento ] . the base area and the height of each cone are functions of the restricted energy loss ( rel ) of the incident ion and thus of the charge @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "stacks of cr39-target - cr39 were exposed to a pb@xmath10 ion beam of 158 a gev at the cern - sps .",
    "the exposures were performed at normal incidence .",
    "the beam passed through some foils of cr39 detector , interacted in the target material and then passed through cr39 foils which recorded the surviving lead projectiles and their fragments . after exposure",
    ", the cr39 detectors were etched for 268 h in a 6n naoh water solution at a temperature of 45 @xmath11c .    for each etch - pit cone , the base area was measured with an automatic image analyzer system . in order to reconstruct the path of the ions , we used a tracking procedure and then we performed for each ion an average of the measured areas .",
    "a distribution of etched cone base areas averaged on @xmath12 faces of the cr39 sheets located after the fragmentation target is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : area ] .",
    "this procedure has a good charge resolution for @xmath13 and an acceptable one up to @xmath14 ; for @xmath15 the fragment tracks and the lead tracks can not be distinguished .",
    "the charge resolution at @xmath16 is @xmath17 for a single measurement and @xmath18 for the average of 12 measurements @xcite .",
    "the charge resolution is worsening with increasing charge of the ions .    for high @xmath9 nuclei ,",
    "the height of the etched cone is more sensitive to @xmath9 than its base area or diameter @xcite . in order to separate the surviving lead ions from the nuclear fragments with charge @xmath15",
    ", we performed manual cone height measurements with an optical microscope .",
    "the charge resolution obtained from this measurement technique is about @xmath19 on a single face of the detector , see fig .",
    "[ fig : coni ] .",
    "this work was aimed at establishing the dependence of the response of the cr39 nuclear track detector on the energy losses of charged particles .",
    "the calibration curve of a nuclear track detector is the plot of the reduced etch rate , @xmath20 , versus rel . for an ion passing through a nuclear track detector , rel is the fraction of the energy loss localized in a cilindrical region with diameter of 100   around its path .",
    "it is the energy loss which leads to @xmath21 rays with energies lower than @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ev for cr39 .",
    "after the exposure described in ",
    "[ par : risoluzione ] , using measurements of the post - etched cone base areas and heights in the charge regions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , we obtained the calibration curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ext - cal ] .",
    "the comparison of this result with previous calibrations using relativistic and low velocity ions @xcite shows that a unique curve describes , within errors , all the data .",
    "we can conclude that the response of the detector depends only from rel .",
    "the macro track - etch detector consists of two types of nuclear track detectors , cr39 and lexan .",
    "most of the work concerns the development and processing of the cr39 .",
    "lexan has a much higher threshold compared to that of cr39 , making it sensitive to relativistic monopoles only .",
    "lexan has not been used until now for monopole searches in macro .",
    "the macro track - etch detector is organized in stacks (  wagons \" ) consisting of three layers of cr39 , each about 1.4 mm thick , three layers of lexan , each 0.25 mm thick , and an aluminium absorber 1 mm thick , fig .",
    "[ fig : vagone ] .",
    "each stack has a surface of @xmath26 @xmath4 and is placed in an aluminized mylar bag filled with dry air .        the restricted energy loss as a function of the monopole velocity in cr39 for @xmath27 bare monopoles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rel ] @xcite .",
    "the horizontal dashed line represents the detection threshold for the macro cr39 , corresponding to the rel value of @xmath28 mev @xmath4 g@xmath29 and to @xmath30 .      in order to determine the acceptance of the macro cr39",
    ", we performed a monte carlo simulation , assuming an isotropic flux of monopoles .",
    "this requires that the masses of the monopoles should be greater than @xmath34 gev and their velocities should be larger than @xmath35 for @xmath36 monopoles and @xmath37 for @xmath38 monopoles and ( m+p ) aggregates .",
    "the total acceptance of the macro cr39 subdetector is 7100 m@xmath5sr for an isotropic flux of fast monopoles .",
    "the passage of a mm in cr39 is expected to cause a structural damage .",
    "chemical etching should result in collinear etch - pit cones of equal size on both faces of each sheet .",
    "after extraction from the macro apparatus , three fiducial holes are drilled in each wagon by a precision drilling machine .",
    "the next steps are : ( i ) a  strong \" etching in 8n naoh water solution at 85 @xmath39c for 50 hours is applied to the first upper sheet of each wagon ; ( ii ) after etching , we perform a first scan in transparency and a successive analysis with a binocular microscope with low magnification ( @xmath40 ) , looking for holes and/or corresponding double etch - pits ; ( iii ) in case of a candidate in the upper sheet , a ",
    "standard \" etching in 6n naoh water solution at 70 @xmath39c for 30 hours is applied to the third sheet .",
    "a good candidate track must satisfy a three - fold coincidence of the position , incident angles among the layers and should also give the same value of rel .    from 1991 until now we etched 227 m@xmath5 of cr39 , with an average exposure time of 7.6 years . since no candidates were found , the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits are given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the acceptance of the extracted wagons and @xmath43 is their exposure time . since the limits corresponding to each individual extraction are independent , the resulting macro cr39 limit is given by the sum of each individual @xmath44 contribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : limite ] we present the flux upper limits for @xmath6 bare mms and for m+p composites obtained by our analysis .",
