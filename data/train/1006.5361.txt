    "the quantum hall effect continuous to intrigue both experimentalists and theorists not only because of the beautifully rich patterns visible in the data but also because of the fascinating physics involved in the collective phenomena of strongly interacting systems .",
    "the first suggestion of a connection between the quantum hall effect and the modular group appeared in @xcite , although these authors focused on a sub - group of the full modular group that did not turn out to have any direct relevance to the current experimental data .",
    "subsequent papers on symmetries of the phase diagram of the quantum hall effect @xcite appeared almost simultaneously from two very different directions and laid the foundations for the application of modular symmetry to the quantum hall effect .",
    "although reference @xcite did not use the mathematical language of modular symmetry the law of corresponding states  put forward in that reference is in fact equivalent to the assumption of modular symmetry @xcite .",
    "modular symmetry gives predictions @xcite for the manner in which the conductivity of a two - dimensional quantum hall sample flows , as the temperature is varied keeping the magnetic field fixed  predictions which have already received strong experimental support @xcite . while the flow diagram presented in @xcite was for spin - split samples the experimental data presented in @xcite",
    "is for spin - degenerate samples .",
    "zeeman splitting in the context of modular symmetry was analysed in @xcite and a flow diagram , deformed by interactions between adjacent landau levels , was given but the fully spin - degenerate case has not yet been treated using modular symmetry    in this paper restrictions on the temperature flow due to modular symmetry are combined with a zeeman splitting analysis to determine the way in which temperature flow changes as the zeeman splitting is smoothly varied between the two extremes of samples with well - split spins and fully spin - degenerate samples . the analysis is restricted to situations with particle - hole symmetry , as modular symmetry is particularly powerful in this case but does not give strong predictions otherwise .",
    "a central prediction of the analysis is that pairs of critical points of the quantum hall phase transitions between adjacent plateaux in spin - split samples must merge as the zeeman splitting is reduced , as shown in figures 12 and 13 .",
    "the law of corresponding states @xcite , for isotropic quantum hall samples with spins well split , can be written in terms of the complex conductivity @xmath0 ( for isotropic samples @xmath1 ) .",
    "a general map between two quantum hall states can be constructed by iterating two generating maps , @xcite : the landau level addition transformation , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the flux attachment transformation , @xmath4 , @xmath5 which attaches two units of statistical gauge field flux to each electron ( we use units with @xmath6 ) .    in samples which enjoy particle - hole symmetry",
    "there is a third map , the particle - hole transformation , @xmath7 , @xmath8 these maps generalise jain s transformations on ground state wavefunctions , @xcite , to include non - zero ohmic conductivity .",
    "repeated iteration of @xmath4 and @xmath2 generate an infinite discrete group which we shall denote @xmath9 .",
    "the infinite discrete group generated by repeated applications of @xmath2 and @xmath10 is called the modular group and is usually denoted by @xmath11 in the mathematical literature @xcite . a general element",
    "@xmath12 sends @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are any four integers satisfying @xmath16 .",
    "group multiplication can be realised in terms of the @xmath17 matrix @xmath18 and demanding that @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to check from the definition ( [ gammadef ] ) that , for any three such matrices satisfying @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 .",
    "thus the group multiplication law is given by matrix multiplication .",
    "the full modular group @xmath11 is not a symmetry of quantum hall effect , for example the element @xmath22 sends @xmath23 which has a fixed point for @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "there is no indication in the experimental data on the quantum hall effect that this point has any special significance ( though it is important in the insulator  superconductor phase transition @xcite ) .",
    "the group @xmath9 is a sub - group of the modular group , it is represented by matrices of the from ( [ gammam ] ) with the extra condition that @xmath27 be even . in matrix notation landau level addition and flux attachment",
    "are represented by @xmath28 and @xmath29    if the electron spins are not split then the story is different . for simplicity",
    "first consider the situation if zeeman splitting is completely absent and states corresponding to two different electron spins are completely degenerate .",
    "then landau level addition sends @xmath30 or @xmath31 , which is @xmath32 .",
    "attaching two units of flux to each electron sends @xmath33 which is @xmath34 acting on @xmath35 .",
    "thus spin generate landau levels give rise to an infinite discrete group generate by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "a general element of this group is of the form @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath27 and @xmath15 integers satisfying @xmath41 , but with @xmath40 restricted to be even .",
    "we denote this group by @xmath42 .",
    "in fact that @xmath42 acting on @xmath35 is the same as @xmath9 acting on @xmath43 .",
    "particle - hole symmetry for degenerate spins is also modified to @xmath44 , so @xmath45 .    for spins that have a slight splitting , so that the landau levels corresponding to opposite spins are not completely degenerate but are still close enough for there to be some mixing between landau level wave - functions , one expects @xmath36 to be a symmetry rather than @xmath46 . at the same time adding two units of statistical flux to each electron in the individual levels is described by @xmath47 . for this intermediate case therefore the group is generated by @xmath36 and @xmath47 and a general element is represented by @xmath38 with @xmath41 and _ both _ @xmath40 and @xmath27 even integers .",
    "this group is denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "clearly @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we are led to suggest the following sequence of symmetries as the zeeman splitting relative to the cyclotron energy is varied from large to small : @xmath51 thus the symmetry first decreases and then increases again as the zeeman splitting is varied .    since the modular group has an infinite number of elements the law of corresponding states maps between an infinite number of quantum hall phases , which is clearly a mathematical idealisation which is never realised in any physical system .",
    "obviously the symmetry breaks down in various limits , such as weak magnetic field , when the landau level splitting becomes comparable with thermal energies , or very strong magnetic fields , when a wigner crystal is expected to form .",
    "the range of validity is discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the law of corresponding states applies to the ac conductivity in the limit of infinite frequency rather than the dc conductivity .",
    "this is because the conductivity is a a function of frequency over temperature , @xmath52 , and the derivation of the law of corresponding states in @xcite takes the limit @xmath53 before @xmath54 and this does not in general commute with the limit required to extract the dc conductivity , namely @xmath54 before @xmath53 .",
    "the precise relationship between these two limits can only be explored in the context of a specific microscopic theory for the conductivity and is not accessible solely through infra - red effective action techniques such as the law of corresponding states . nevertheless the law of corresponding states has been applied to dc conductivities , for example with regard to temperature flows , and the experimental data are in remarkable agreement with the predictions @xcite .",
    "while some microscopic models may display a symmetry which makes the order in which the limits are taken irrelevant @xcite this is not generic , but since we do not commit ourselves to a specific model here we can not address this question directly .",
    "rather our philosophy will be to develop the predictions of the law of corresponding states , see where they lead , and future experiments will test their validity .",
    "scaling arguments @xcite suggest that , at low temperatures , the dc conductivity should be a function of a single variable , @xmath55 , rather than of the temperature @xmath56 and magnetic field @xmath57 separately . here",
    "@xmath58 is the deviation of the magnetic field from the critical value @xmath59 separating two quantum hall phases and @xmath60 is a scaling exponent , experimentally @xmath61 .",
    "the conductivity depends on the electron scattering length @xmath62 and we define the scaling function @xmath63 assuming @xmath62 is a strictly monotonic function of temperature , increasing as @xmath56 decreases , the temperature flow described by the scaling function @xmath64 will have the same topology as the flow described by @xmath65  they will have the same fixed points , @xmath66 if and only if @xmath67 .",
    "we do not need to determine either @xmath65 or @xmath68 exactly , in fact if @xmath69 is _ any _ monotonic function of @xmath56 , decreasing as @xmath56 decreases , then the flow described by @xmath70 will have the same topology as both that of @xmath68 and of @xmath65 .    if the law of corresponding states correctly describes the low temperature physics then the scaling flow commutes with the law of corresponding states map .",
    "from this it can be concluded that any value of the complex conductivity @xmath71 that is a fixed point of the modular group ( in the sense that there exists an element @xmath72 of the modular group such that @xmath73 ) must also be a fixed point of the scaling flow , @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath74 this follows because the assumption @xmath73 requires [ sigmaflow ]",
    "_ s(_*,_*)=_s((_*),(_*))=s.| _ _ * = 1 ( c _ * + d)^2_s(_*,_*)which is only possible if @xmath75 or if @xmath76 or @xmath77 . if @xmath78 then @xmath79 and , excluding the trivial case @xmath80 , @xmath81 , this is not possible if the ohmic conductivity @xmath82 at the fixed point .",
    "assuming @xmath83 is not infinite we conclude that @xmath76 and @xmath71 is a fixed point of the flow .",
    "the fixed points with @xmath84 are isolated and easy to enumerate , since @xmath85 now @xmath41 , with @xmath86 even for all three groups @xmath9 , @xmath42 and @xmath48 , hence @xmath87 must be odd so both @xmath39 and @xmath15 must be odd . demanding @xmath84",
    "then requires that @xmath88 .",
    "hence @xmath89 , @xmath90 , but @xmath39 and @xmath15 are both odd so @xmath90 is ruled out and we can conclude that @xmath91",
    ". hence [ sigmastar ] _ * = as the ohmic conductivity , @xmath92 , can not be negative .",
    "a matrix @xmath72 that leaves @xmath71 fixed must now be of the form @xmath93 with @xmath94 with @xmath39 odd .",
    "let @xmath95 for some integer @xmath96 , then @xmath97 and @xmath98 mod @xmath99 .",
    "in particular @xmath40 and @xmath27 can not both be even so @xmath48 has _ no _ fixed points with @xmath100 .    to summarise :",
    "@xmath9 has fixed points above the real axis of the form ( [ sigmastar ] ) with @xmath39 odd and @xmath27 even ; @xmath42 has fixed points above the real axis of the form ( [ sigmastar ] ) with @xmath39 and @xmath27 both odd ; @xmath48 has no fixed points above the real axis .",
    "although any fixed point of the modular group with @xmath84 must be a fixed point of the flow the converse does not necessarily hold , there could be fixed points of the flow that are not fixed points of the modular group .",
    "any such point would have an infinite number of images under the group action",
    ". however there is no sign any such extra fixed points in the experimental data for spin split samples so we shall assume that there are no fixed points for @xmath9 , other than those required by the symmetry",
    ". for brevity in the following this will be referred as the _",
    "minimalist assumption_. if we assume that the topology of the flow varies smoothly as the zeeman energy is varied then the @xmath9 fixed points can not suddenly disappear when @xmath9 is broken to the smaller group @xmath48 , they must move down towards the real axis .",
    "we shall likewise assume that the only fixed points of the flow for degenerate spins are those of @xmath42 and these move smoothly down towards the real axis as the degeneracy is lifted .",
    "the topology of the flow is determined by the fixed points and some other rather mild assumptions @xcite , such as decreasing ohmic conductivity when @xmath101 as the temperature is reduced , as in a semi - conductor , and attractive fixed points at integer quantum hall plateaux .",
    "we can plot the flow by changing variables from @xmath35 to @xmath102 where @xmath103 is invariant under @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath104 , with @xmath105 , @xcite .",
    "since @xmath106 represents a vector flow in a two - dimensional space this is just a change of co - ordinates in that space . in the new parametrisation",
    "the flow is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "the invariant function @xmath103 that has the smallest number of poles and zeros in the complex plane is unique , up to a constant rescaling and addition of a constant , @xcite .",
    "it is most easily expressed in terms of jacobi @xmath109-functions : @xmath110 where",
    "_ 3()=_n=-^e^in^2_2=2_n=0^e^i(n+)^2.it is also useful to define [ theta - identity ] ^4_4()=_n=-^(-1)^n",
    "e^in^2 = ^4_3()-^4_2 ( ) .then these functions have the following transformation properties under @xmath2 and @xmath4 : @xmath111 ( we use the notation of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore under @xmath112 , @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",
    "hence particle - hole interchange swaps @xmath115 and assuming particle - hole symmetry has the important consequence for the scaling function that [ phinterchange ] _ ( , ) = = _ ( , ) .this then implies that an expansion of @xmath116 in powers of @xmath103 and @xmath117 has only real co - efficients and we draw the important conclusion that , starting from any point for which @xmath103 is real , the flow can never generate an imaginary part for @xmath103 . in other words any curve on which @xmath103 is real is in integral curve of the flow @xcite : this is a key observation in creating the flow diagrams below .",
    "in particular @xmath103 is real on vertical lines above the integer points on the real line and one the semi - circles of radius @xmath118 joining the integers ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "while @xmath103 is not invariant under the larger groups @xmath9 and @xmath42 the following functions of @xmath103 are :    * @xmath119 is invariant under @xmath9 ; * @xmath120 is invariant under @xmath42 .",
    "the functions @xmath121 and @xmath122 can be used to determine the topology of the flow for @xmath9 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "fixed points of @xmath9 , respectively @xmath42 , must be fixed points of the flow , and these are enumerated in equation ( [ sigmastar ] ) .",
    "next , as above , we argue that demanding particle - hole symmetry implies that curves on which @xmath121 , respectively @xmath122 , is real will be integral curves of the flow .",
    "the flow can then be modelled qualitatively by taking @xmath123 to be a meromorphic function of @xmath35 , @xmath124 .",
    "although there is no physical argument for meromorphicity by plotting the flow in this case we can get a picture of what it looks like , the inclusion of @xmath125 dependence can only result in a smooth deformation of the meromorphic flow which leaves the fixed points invariant .",
    "meromorphic functions satisfying ( [ sigmaflow ] ) are called modular forms in the mathematical literature @xcite and their properties are well known .",
    "for @xmath9 it was shown in @xcite that the minimalist assumption leads to [ split - flow ] _",
    "s()=-= = , where @xmath126 ( the second and third forms of this equation rely on equation ( [ theta - identity ] ) and the fact that [ lambdaprime]= , a result that can be derived using the techniques in @xcite ) .",
    "the integral curves of the flow ( [ split - flow ] ) are plotted in figure 3 .",
    "it should be borne in mind that ( [ split - flow ] ) does not give a quantitative description of the temperature flow , because the function @xmath69 is undetermined . by changing @xmath69 , @xmath123",
    "can be multiplied by a function of @xmath56 , but as long as @xmath69 is strictly monotonic and real this will not change the fixed points nor will it change the fact that curves on which @xmath121 is real are integral curves of the flow  it will merely change the _ rate _ at which the flow lines in figure 3 are traversed as the temperature is changed , and this rate is not evident in the figure . also physical quantum hall samples can not be expected to give meromorphic flow , in a real sample @xmath127 will depend on @xmath125 and @xmath35 independently , but similar arguments apply : @xmath125 dependence can only distort the flow smoothly from the meromorphic flow shown leaving the fixed points invariant and , again assuming particle - hole symmetry , the vertical lines above the integers and the semi - circles , together with their images under @xmath9 , will not be affected ( equation ( [ phinterchange ] ) does not require meromorphicity ) .",
    "figure 3 should be compared to the experimental data in @xcite for spin split samples .",
    "for @xmath42 similar arguments applied to @xmath122 lead to [ degenerate - flow ] _",
    "s()= = = and this flow is plotted in figure 11 .",
    "this should be compared to the experimental flow for the spin degenerate sample in @xcite  the agreement is remarkable .    for samples intermediate between degenerate and well split",
    "spins @xmath48 symmetry is not as powerful as there are no fixed points with @xmath128 .",
    "nevertheless we would expect there to be fixed points of the flow , the fixed points of @xmath9 for spin split samples and of @xmath42 for spin degenerate samples can hardly just disappear when the zeeman splitting is smoothly varied . the minimalist assumption can not be used for @xmath48 .",
    "we can however assume that the fixed points of @xmath9 and @xmath42 persist when the zeeman splitting is varied , but their position is no longer dictated by modular symmetry .",
    "we seek a smooth deformation from figure 3 to figure 11 , equation ( [ split - flow ] ) to equation ( [ degenerate - flow ] ) , as the zeeman splitting is increased , a deformation which is compatible with particle - hole symmetry , @xmath129 . in order to avoid creating new spurious fixed points",
    "we keep the order of the polynomials in @xmath103 fixed in the numerators and denominators of ( [ split - flow ] ) and ( [ degenerate - flow ] ) , and this dictates that the interpolating flow must be of the form [ general - flowa ] _",
    "s()= , where @xmath130 , @xmath57 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are constants .",
    "particle - hole symmetry requires @xmath133 , which dictates that @xmath130 , @xmath57 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 be real .",
    "equation ( [ lambdaprime ] ) shows that a factor @xmath134 will appear in @xmath124 , unless @xmath135 , and this would introduce a new zero when @xmath136 that is not there in either ( [ split - flow ] ) or ( [ degenerate - flow ] ) . to avoid this we set @xmath135 and",
    "the only possible deformation that is compatible with our assumptions is , up to an overall constant factor , [ general - flow ] _",
    "s()= z= , with @xmath137 independent of @xmath35 and real .",
    "the free parameter @xmath137 varies from @xmath138 for @xmath9 to @xmath139 for @xmath42 ( an overall factor of 2 multiplying ( [ split - flow ] ) does not change figure 3 , indeed ( [ split - flow ] ) is only derived in @xcite up to an overall positive constant ) .",
    "figure 2 shows how the fixed point @xmath140 of @xmath9 moves as @xmath137 is varied : particle - hole symmetry constrains it to keep to the real curve of @xmath103 shown in figure 1 .",
    "the point associated with @xmath139 can be gained from from @xmath141 either by going anti - clockwise or clockwise .",
    "suppose first that @xmath137 increases monotonically between @xmath142 and @xmath143 as the zeeman splitting is varied smoothly from well - split spins , @xmath9 , to degenerate spins , @xmath42 .",
    "figure 2 shows that , as @xmath137 is increased from @xmath142 to @xmath144 , the fixed point at @xmath145 of the @xmath9 flow ( figure 3 ) follows the semi - circular arc of radius @xmath146 , moving down to the left until it hits the origin in the @xmath35-plane , @xmath147 when @xmath148 .",
    "it then continues up the imaginary axis , through @xmath149 for @xmath150 , to @xmath151 for @xmath152 ( near @xmath152 equation ( [ general - flow ] ) can be replaced with _",
    "s()= , where @xmath153 , multiplying @xmath123 by a constant does not change the topology of the flow ) .",
    "the fixed point subsequently moves down from @xmath154 to @xmath155 ( a @xmath42 fixed point , figure 11 ) as @xmath137 increases from @xmath156 to @xmath143 . while experimental data to date do show a fixed point on the semi - circle spanning @xmath143 to @xmath156 that is to the left of @xmath157 , @xcite",
    ", it does not seem likely that this sequence of flows can be the correct one . a fixed point at @xmath149 when @xmath158 has never been seen in any hall sample .",
    "indeed such fixed points were identified in @xcite as being associated with bosonic pseudo - particles excitations ( as in the superconductor - insulator transition of @xcite for example ) , rather the fermionic pseudo - particle excitations of the quantum hall effect . since no quantum hall sample to date",
    "has ever exhibited a critical point at @xmath24 we exclude this possibility .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the flow morphs from figure 3 to figure 11 by decreasing @xmath137 from @xmath159 going through @xmath160 to @xmath161 to continue down to @xmath162 .",
    "the nine plots in figures 3 to 11 show the series of flows for @xmath163 the fixed point at @xmath164 for samples with well - split spins moves left and down as the zeeman splitting is decreased , along the semi - circle of radius @xmath146 centred @xmath165 , until it hits the real axis at @xmath166 ( for @xmath167 ) , where it merges with the incoming fixed point coming from @xmath157 on the left .",
    "it then moves vertically upwards to the point @xmath168 when @xmath139 , which is the fixed point for degenerate samples with symmetry @xmath42 .",
    "every flow in the sequence has @xmath48 symmetry , which is enhanced to @xmath9 or @xmath42 at the extreme values @xmath141 and @xmath139 respectively .    in real samples particle - hole symmetry is hardly likely to be an exact symmetry of the system , there will be deviations from this picture .",
    "but any deviations will be small if particle - hole interchange is a reasonably good symmetry : for example if @xmath169 is small , where @xmath170 is the particle mass and @xmath171 the hole mass . in particular",
    "the collision of the critical points at @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) seems likely to be an artifact of the mathematical idealisation of exact particle - hole symmetry , as there is no obvious physical mechanism governing the merging of two critical points as the zeeman energy is reduced .",
    "the most plausible scenario here is that the merge is postponed in a real sample until the zeeman splitting is reduced to very small values and the proposed trajectory of a real sample , in which particle - hole interchange is a good but not exact symmetry , is shown in figure 12 .",
    "this is a small perturbation of the mathematically idealised flows shown in figures 3 to 11 which is still compatible with the proposed symmetries .",
    "the topology of the temperature flow of conductivities in quantum hall samples is tightly constrained by the law of corresponding states , expressed in terms of modular transformations on the complex conductivity ( [ complexsigma ] ) . for the extreme cases of well - split spins and degenerate spins the critical points in the complex plane are determined by the symmetry . for intermediate values of the zeeman splitting modular symmetry",
    "does not determine the position of the critical points but one can assume that they move around the complex plane in a continuous manner as the zeeman splitting is varied .",
    "in the case of samples exhibiting particle - hole symmetry modular symmetry is particularly powerful , leading to the statement that the curves in figure 1 , and their images under @xmath48 modular transformations , will be trajectories of the conductivity flow as the temperature is varied keeping the magnetic field fixed .",
    "this statement should be true for any zeeman splitting .",
    "zeeman energies which are large enough to give well - split spins result in critical points at @xmath172 between integer hall plateaux @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "zeeman energies which are so small that the spins are degenerate give critical points at @xmath175 between integer hall plateaux @xmath176 and @xmath177 ( figure 11 ) .",
    "the form of the flow as the zeeman splitting is varied from the spin - split to the spin degenerate case is shown in figures 3 to 11 .",
    "figure 12 shows proposed trajectories of two critical points as the zeeman energy is reduced in a real sample exhibiting symmetry under particle - interchange which is good but not exact .",
    "the analysis here has assumed that the parameter @xmath137 varies monotonically as the zeeman energy is varied , implying that the critical point at @xmath178 in the transition between @xmath166 and @xmath179 in spin - split samples moves to the right , down towards to @xmath166 , as the zeeman splitting is reduced .",
    "there is as yet no experimental evidence for such behaviour : indeed in @xcite a critical point is found on the semi - circle spanning 0 to 1 in the complex conductivity plane which is to the _ left _ of @xmath178 .",
    "this could be a consequence of a constant re - scaling of @xmath180 , @xcite , or , perhaps more likely , it may indicate that @xmath137 is not monotonic .",
    "it could be that the critical point at @xmath178 ( @xmath141 in equation ( [ general - flow ] ) ) in spin - split samples first starts to move down and to the left ( @xmath181 ) and then reverses to retrace its steps back to @xmath141 before starting to travel down to the right towards @xmath166 as @xmath137 decreases below @xmath142 .",
    "a possible trajectory is shown in figure 13 .",
    "while this would be compatible with the experimental data to date any physical explanation of such a trajectory , which is certainly allowed by the law of corresponding states combined with particle - hole symmetry , would go beyond the general predictions following from these assumptions and would probably require a more specific microscopic model .",
    "more experimental data would be welcome in order to determine the true behaviour of the critical points .",
