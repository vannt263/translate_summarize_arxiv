    "if this is a single star , it most likely belongs to the class of luminous blue variables ( lbvs , with bolometric absolute magnitudes above @xmath46 ) , to which belong all known stars of such high luminosities , including all the well - studied cases in our galaxy ( see below ) .",
    "red supergiants ( rsgs ; @xmath47 ) , blue supergiants ( bsgs ; e.g. , the progenitor of sn 1987a , @xmath48 ) and even the so - called rare `` cool hypergiants '' ( @xmath49 ) are all fainter than this source ( see , e.g. , humphreys & davidson 1994 ; their fig . 9 ) .      the magnitude given above",
    "is not corrected for possible extinction in ngc 266 , the host galaxy of sn 2005gl .",

    "3 of that work , all sne with na d lines weaker than ew@xmath52    have measured @xmath53 , which we therefore adopt as a conservative upper limit on dust extinction along this line of sight , implying @xmath54 mag .    additionally , the very blue spectrum of the sn at early time argues against significant extinction .",

    "reddening this putative hot spectrum using the cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) law with r=3.08 and extinction values of @xmath57 results in model observed spectra that are redder ( underpredict the blue flux ) than our snifs spectrum . we therefore conclude that @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is a robust upper limit on the optical extinction of sn 2005gl ( the likely value , as argued above , is much smaller ) .",
    "note , that such modest host extinction would drive up the magnitude of the putative progenitor star , making an lbv identification stronger yet .",
    "the main caveat remaining is establishing that the point source we have detected in the pre - explosion _ hst _ imaging is the progenitor of sn 2005gl is the possibility that this source is a compact , luminous star cluster , rather than a single star .",
    "compact luminous clusters with properties similar to those we measure ( often called `` super star clusters '' , or sscs ) are observed in very active galaxies ( such as starburst or interacting galaxies ) .",
    "however , they are generally rare in more normal galaxies ( with but a single ssc candidate , westerlund 1 , observed in our galaxy ) and are expected to be even less frequent in earlier - type galaxies such as ngc 266 ( an sa galaxy , nilson 1973 ; via ned ) .",
    "the majority of massive sn progenitors in early spirals are not found in sscs , and thus we believe that sn 2005gl probably did not explode in such an environment .",
    "however , this possibility can not be ruled out at this time . additional _ hst _",
    "imaging obtained once sn 2005gl declines should provide decisive evidence , with the point source at the sn location either gone ( if it was a single star ) or remaining approximately at the same magnitude , if it is indeed an ssc .",
    "additional support for the association between sne iin ( such as sn 2005gl ) and lbv progenitors could arise if additional such cases are discovered . while sne iin are intrinsically rare ( cappellaro et al . 1997 )",
    ", they tend to be over - represented in observed sn sampled due to their high average luminosity . in addition , the luminosity of lbv progenitors makes them visible in galaxies which are far more distant than hosts of less luminous stars .",
    "the number of such galaxies in the _ hst _ archive is higher than the number of nearby ones ( @xmath60 mpc ) usually considered as likely candidates for progenitor studies , again increasing the opportunity to test the association of sne iin with lbv progenitors in the future .",
    "we now examine the hypothesis that lbv stars explode as sn iin .",
    "the class of type iin sne is known to be a heterogeneous group of events . at least two subsets represent specific and probably unrelated phenomena to the one we consider here , namely , the core - collapse - driven explosion of a massive lbv star , similar , for example , to the well - known @xmath2-carina in our galaxy .",
    "the first unrelated class are the so - called `` sn impostors '' , which are believed to be super - outbursts of lbvs which do not result in total disruption of the progenitor star ( see , e.g. , van dyk 2005 and maund et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "these events are typically faint ( compared to a normal sn ) with absolute magnitudes between @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( van dyk 2005 ) , while `` genuine '' type iin explosions ( schlegel 1990 ) , are much brighter ( sometime reaching @xmath63 ; sn 2005gl has @xmath64 ) . the second group of events which are also probably irrelevant to our discussion are the recently discovered class of `` hybrid '' ia / iin sne , including the prototype sn 2002ic ( hamuy et al .",
    "2003 ; wood - vasey et al . 2004 ) along with its recent ( sn 2005gj , prieto et al . 2005 ; aldering et al .",
    "2006 ) and past ( sn 1997cy , germany et al .",
    "2000 , turrato et al .",

    "such events have been suggested to be thermonuclear sne ia , exploding either in close proximity to recently stripped gas from a binary companion with intense mass loss ( e.g. , an agb star , hamuy et al .",
    "2003 ) ; within a symbiotic system ; or perhaps thermonuclear explosion that occur while the envelope of the exploding star is still intact (  sne 1.5  , iben & renzini 1983 ) . in any case ,",
    "sn 2005gl does not share the spectroscopic properties of these hybrid events , and does not appear to be related to this iin sub - class ( fig .",
    "[ specfig ] ) .",
    "we note that both of the sub - groups discussed above comprise a minority within the observed population of sne iin .",
    "so , we can reformulate our question to be : can lbvs be the progenitors of most sn iin explosions ?",
    "we focus on the best - studied example of an lbv in our galaxy , @xmath2 carina .",
    "the envelope of this star still contains large quantities of hydrogen ( e.g. , davidson et al .",
    "1986 ) , so , had it exploded now , it would result in a type ii ( h - rich ) sn .",
    "in addition , we observe the results of copious mass loss around this system , of order several solar masses of ejected material , mostly h. were an energetic explosion to occur at the center of such a huge debris cloud , we would expect strong interaction leading to strong narrow h lines - the hallmark of type iin sne .",
    "thus , we conclude that an lbv exploding during the active mass - ejection phase , or shortly thereafter , would indeed appear to distant observers as a type iin sn .    the rates of sne  iin may shed some light on our proposed progenitor association .",
    "let us consider a simplistic massive star evolutionary scheme , for single stars with approximately solar metallicity , broadly following , e.g. , maeder and conti ( 1994 ) .",
    "we use the customary notations rsg for red supergiants , wn for n - rich ( and usually also he - rich ) wolf - rayet stars , wc for c - rich w - r stars , and wo for o - rich w - r stars .",
    "@xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    @xmath69    we note that sne iin can , in this picture , occur in two distinct cases .",
    "first , it is believed that massive stars undergo short lbv phases , involving rapid and strong mass loss which transform h - rich supergiants to w - r stars , as well as during the early w - r evolution stages ( while the stars still have significant amounts of h , i.e. , are wn stars ; see , e.g. , maeder & conti 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , since the evolution of the inner core is decoupled from that of the envelope during these stages , in some cases the core might collapse during those short - lived transition phase , resulting in sne iin from stars in the mass range , comparable to that of the progenitors of sne iib / l and ib / c . in this context",
    "we note the recent work by chugai & chevalier ( 2006 ) interpreting the observations of sn 2001em , which exploded as a sn ic , and then developed strong interaction signatures ( a bright radio signal accompanied by sn iin - like narrow h@xmath70 lines , stockdale et al .",
    "2004 ; soderberg , gal - yam , & kulkarni 2004 ; bietenholz & bartel 2005 ) .",
    "models by these authors suggest that sn 2001em underwent a violent and intense , hydrogen - rich , mass ejection episode , shortly ( @xmath71 ) years before the sn explosion .",
    "it appears sn 2001em exploded shortly after it exited a recent lbv phase , and a similar event , occurring slightly ( on stellar evolution timescales ) earlier , would appear as a sn iin .",
    "the second case is a speculative option which we now describe .",
    "we hypothesize that in the case of the most massive stars ( eq .",
    "1 ) the evolution of the core might be rapid enough to overtake the progress of envelope mass loss , and that these stars might undergo core - collapse while in their first lbv phase , before they are significantly stripped .",
    "sne iin in this case take the place of sne ic as the end products of the rare , most massive stars .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that explosion models of sne ic , including the most energetic ones associated with grbs ( e.g. , deng et al . 2005 ; mazzali et al .",
    "2006 ) require massive progenitors ( with zero - age mass @xmath72 ) , but not as massive as the claimed masses of the most extreme lbvs ( @xmath73 ) , e.g. , @xmath2-carina ( figer et al .",
    "1998 ) , lbv 1806 ( eikenberry et al . 2004 ) or the pistol star ( figer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we note that this scenario , in which the core evolution overtakes the envelope stripping , is not in accord with current stellar evolution models .",
    "still , we think it is an interesting option that merits further theoretical and observational examination .",
    "we note that chugai et al .",
    "( 2004 ) interpret their observations of the type iin sn 1994w as indicating that the progenitor underwent an explosive mass ejection shortly before its core collapsed and led to its final explosion as a sn .",
    "this would fit well with the above picture of sne iin resulting from lbvs like @xmath2-carina ( which are known to undergo extreme and violent massive loss episodes ) during or shortly after their active phase .    in either of the above cases , we expect these sne from lbv progenitors to be rare ( either because lbvs are short - lived phases , or because the progenitors are very rare stars ) . for example",
    ", the total number of stars with initial mass above @xmath74 is @xmath75 of the total core - collapse progenitor population ( @xmath76 ) for a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function .",
    "this is similar to the estimated fraction of sne iin of the total core - collapse population ( @xmath77 , cappellaro et al .",
    "we conclude that the notion that some or most of sne iin result from explosions of lbvs appears broadly consistent with available observational data .      in fig .",
    "[ mapfig ] we summarize the accumulated knowledge from direct observations of sn progenitor stars in the form of a progenitor - sn map . as possible progenitor classes we consider red and blue supergiants ( rsgs and bsgs ) , lbvs , early ( he rich ) and late ( c / o rich ) wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars , and massive binaries . on the sn side we list all the major well - defined sub - classes of core - collapse sne",
    ". among the h - rich type ii subclasses ,",
    "sne ii - p have extended plateau optical light curves , while sn 1987a - like events are fainter and have a late hump - like peak in their optical light curves .",
    "sne iin ( excluding the specific subsets described in @xmath78 above ) generally have blue and rather featureless spectra with balmer emission - line profiles which include a narrow component ( @xmath79 km s@xmath27 ) and are often very luminous in the optical , consistent with a strong contribution from shocked csm .",
    "the transition class of sne iil / iib have rapidly declining light curves and often display strong he lines , developing into events with spectra similar to sne ib ( see below ) .",
    "of the h - poor type i sne , type ib events are dominated by he lines , while type ic lack both h and he and are dominated by intermediate - mass elements such as o , mg , si and ca .",
    "it must be stressed that this is , by necessity , a simplified presentation of the core - collapse sn `` zoo '' , and that many peculiar objects which do not strictly fit into this picture , or transition objects that are either intermediate or evolve between classes , are known .",
    "still , this scheme should include the majority of observed objects .",
    "we suggest this is a useful tool to present and discuss this topic . of course",
    ", we have no guaranties that this map is complete ( perhaps more progenitor classes or sn types are required ) nor that it is a 1-to-1 mapping .",
    "most likely this version will evolve and change .",
    "let us use it for the time being as a basis for discussion .",
    "we note that the association of type ii - p sne with low - mass rsg progenitors is well - supported by 4 observed events , with no counter examples , and maintain this association is now progressing from suggestive to robust ( including also numerous supporting upper limits ; smartt et al .",
    "studies of the ( h and he - poor ) type ic sn 2004gt ( gal - yam et al . 2005",
    "; maund et al . 2005 ) and to a lesser degree sn 2002ap ( smartt et al . 2002 ) suggest these had highly evolved ( i.e. , optically less - luminous ) w - r progenitors , perhaps of the wc or wo subclasses .",
    "this may fit well with the population of less - evolved w - r stars ( late wn ) exploding as he - rich type ib events , consistent with recent explosion models by tominaga et al .",
    "this picture is consistent with that expected from stellar evolution theory .",
    "the case of the transition class of type iib objects ( which evolve from having h - dominated type ii spectra toward the he - dominated type ib class ) is less clear .",
    "observations of the prototypical event sn 1993j in m81 suggest a possible massive binary progenitor ( aldering et al .",
    "1994 ; van dyk et al . 2002 ; smartt et al .",
    "2004 ) with some support from the recent work on sn 2001ig ( ryder et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 ) . however , it is unclear whether the nearby putative binaries were indeed physically important or even bound to the sn progenitors , or perhaps ( some ) sne iib arise from single wn ( h rich ) w - r stars ( soderberg et al . 2005 ) .    finally , we note that type iin events , which show evidence for intense interaction with circumstellar material , suggesting heavy mass - loss from the progenitor , appear to require a different progenitor from those so far discussed .",
    "red supergiants have little mass loss , and so had the blue supergiant progenitor of sn 1987a . while lbvs are not the only option , they provide an elegant solution , as discussed above .",
    "it would appear that our putative map now encompasses all main sn types .",
    "of course , more data are required to establish a robust mapping , and we would like each line to be supported by several progenitor - sn associations ( as is the case for sne ii - p and red supergiants ) .",
    "additional cases may also allow an attempt to understand the effects of other parameters ( beyond initial mass ) such as metallicity , rotation and binarity .",
    "we have identified a luminous point source in pre - explosion images of the location of the typical type iin sn 2005gl . if this was a single star it was most likely an lbv , based on luminosity considerations .",
    "we have discussed a major caveat - the possibility that this point - like source is actually a compact luminous cluster - and ways by which this progenitor identification can be tested by future observations .",
    "we suggest that an association of sne iin with lbv progenitors accommodates much of what is currently known about both lbvs and sne iin .",
    "we introduce the progenitor - sn map and use it as a basis to discuss our finding .",
    "this field has rapidly progressed in recent years and should evolve from a collection of isolated fragmented pieces of information to become based on more solid concepts ( such as the progenitor - sn map ) .",
    "these should soon begin to provide useful constraints on models , and drive additional progress in understanding the last stages of massive star evolution and the physics of sne .",
