    "cosmic strings are linear topological defects predicted by many models of particle physics that go beyond the standard model , e.g. in supergravity @xcite , brane inflation @xcite and `` string gas cosmology '' @xcite models . in models which admit these defects , a network of cosmic strings is inevitably @xcite formed during a phase transition in the very early universe and will persist to the present time .",
    "this is true as long as the phase transition occurred after the period of inflation ( provided there was inflation ) .",
    "since strings carry energy , they lead to gravitational effects which induce distinctive signatures in cosmological observations .",
    "since the string tension ( which equals the mass per unit length @xmath0 ) increases as the energy scale @xmath1 at the time of string formation , the magnitude of the predicted signatures of strings increases as the energy scale grows .",
    "thus , a search for observational signatures of strings allows us to constrain the physics occurring at energies much larger that can be probed by earth - based particle accelerators .",
    "it has long been known that cosmic strings are able to produce many interesting effects for cosmology . in particular , cosmic strings",
    "lead to a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations @xcite .",
    "initially , the focus of interest was on strings which have large enough tension to explain the entire amplitude of the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "such strings would need to have a value of the tension given ( in dimensionless units ) by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the perturbations produced by cosmic strings are , however , active and incoherent @xcite and hence do not lead to acoustic oscillations in the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "thus , when conclusive evidence for the existence of these oscillations was reached @xcite , it became clear that cosmic strings could not be the dominant source of structure formation @xcite and interest in cosmological effects of strings collapsed .",
    "however , in light of the fact that in many models of inflation ( or other explanations for the dominant gaussian component of the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations ) cosmic strings are predicted , there has lately been a revival of interest in searching for cosmic strings ( see e.g. @xcite for recent surveys ) .",
    "a second reason for the revival of interest in searching for strings is that there have been great advances and technological breakthroughs in observational cosmology which are now making it possible to search for signals of cosmic strings with much lower tensions than those previously considered .",
    "the searches have been progressing in many directions .",
    "first of all , cosmic strings will contribute to the power spectrum of density fluctuations @xcite and to associated cmb anisotropies @xcite .",
    "signatures of these fluctuations can be searched for in optical and infrared galaxy surveys and in cmb temperature anisotropy maps .",
    "cosmic strings leave behind distinctive signals in 21 cm redshift surveys @xcite and in cmb polarization maps @xcite .",
    "considerable work has been done to study the effects of strings in the angular power spectrum of cmb temperature and polarization maps @xcite .",
    "analyses combining the spt @xcite and wmap 7-year @xcite data were able to place the bound @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "similar bounds are obtained @xcite using data from the act telescope @xcite and by the recent planck survey @xcite .",
    "improved bounds might be achievable by analyzing cmb maps using statistical tools which are designed to pick out the string - induced non - gaussianities ( see e.g. @xcite for some recent studies ) .",
    "in addition to these purely gravitational effects , cosmic strings can be responsible for the production of highly energetic bursts of particles @xcite , electromagnetic radiation in a wide range of frequencies @xcite and they can help seed coherent magnetic fields on galactic scales @xcite .",
    "cosmic string loops decay by emitting gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "decay into particle is also possible but the efficiency of particle production from strings remains uncertain .",
    "studies using nambu - goto strings and fields theory strings yield different results",
    ". studies using nambu - goto strings illustrate that non - superconducting strings decay predominantly via emitting gravitational radiation , whereas field theory simulations indicate that the decay into particles can also be important ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in any case , strings lead to a scale - invariant stochastic background of gravitational waves @xcite which can be constrained by pulsar timing measurements .",
    "cusps on string loops may lead to additional emission of gravitational waves @xcite , and a resulting constraint on the cosmic string tension of @xmath5 @xcite has been reported .",
    "however the bound is sensitive to details of cosmic string cusps which are subject to potentially large back - reaction effects @xcite .",
    "a bound of @xmath6 resulting from constraints on the amplitude of gravitational radiation from pulsar timing constraints is more realistic @xcite .",
    "observational optical astronomy is also experiencing a phase of rapid progress .",
    "larger telescopes are probing the universe at increasing depth , i.e. at increasing redshift .",
    "since cosmic strings produce non - linear density perturbations at arbitrarily large redshifts , it is expected that the signals of cosmic strings will stand out from the structures produced by the main source of fluctuations ( gaussian fluctuations ) more clearly at high redshifts than at low ones .",
    "signals from structures seeded by string loops have been studied in a recent paper by schlaer et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier work ) who found that loops could cause significant star formation to occur at high redshift .",
    "therefore cosmic strings with enough mass will have an impact on the epoch of reionization @xcite .",
    "string loops would also seed dense dark matter clumps .",
    "if dark matter self - annihilates , the fermi telescope may be sensitive to gamma - rays from the population of these clumps today @xcite .",
    "in this note we address early structure formation from cosmic string wakes @xcite .",
    "wakes lead to cosmic structures with a distinctive shape in position space maps .",
    "these non - gaussian features may allow the signals of strings to be detected in a background of gaussian noise even if the amplitude of the string - induced signal is quite low , as studied for cmb anisotropy maps in @xcite .",
    "in section [ background ] we give some background about the formation and properties of cosmic string wakes . in section [ sec_massfunction ]",
    "we investigate the contribution of string wakes to structure formation as a function of redshift .",
    "finally we discuss the implications and observational signals in section [ discussion ] .",
    "according to the kibble mechanism @xcite , the formation of cosmic strings from a symmetry breaking phase transition implies the existence of a string network .",
    "this network is expected to evolve towards a scaling solution which states that its properties become constant if all lengths are scaled to the hubble radius @xcite .",
    "the network is composed of two parts .",
    "the first is a network of  infinite \" strings ( which includes loops with radius greater than the hubble radius ) whose curvature radius @xmath7 can be shown to be of the order of the hubble scale , i.e. @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the fact that the curvature radius scales with @xmath10 is maintained by intersections and self - intersections of the long strings .",
    "such intersections create string loops that detach from the long string network , thus allowing the latter to straighten out .",
    "this brings us to the second part of the network : a distribution of string loops with curvature radius much smaller than the hubble scale .",
    "following @xcite we model a long string as a superposition of straight string segments , each of whose length is given by @xmath7 .",
    "this is a reasonable model since any wiggles on the strings would either be redshifted away or would cause self - intersections .",
    "the scaling solution suggests @xmath11 long string per hubble volume , which is supported by numerical simulations which yield @xmath12 with a loop distribution possessing a scaling peak at the loop radius of size @xmath13 of the hubble radius @xcite ( for earlier work on cosmic string simulations using nambu - goto strings see e.g. @xcite and using field theory strings see e.g. @xcite )",
    ".    the geometry of space around a long straight string will be conical with deficit angle @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a long string moving with speed @xmath15 will sweep a plane on which residing static observers would see that matter acquires a velocity kick @xmath16 towards the plane ( where @xmath17 is the relativistic gamma factor associated with the velocity @xmath15 ) .",
    "the streams of matter will overlap and create a wedge with twice the background density @xcite .",
    "the overdense region will eventually collapse under gravitational instability and form a virialized planar structure called the string wake .",
    "the growth of the wake will proceed by matter accretion .",
    "we will briefly review the dynamics of this process .",
    "let us consider the effect of the wake on a particle s motion by labelling its physical distance to the wake by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the comoving position , @xmath20 the displacement and @xmath21 the scale factor .",
    "the initial conditions are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the zeldovich approximation @xcite gives as equation of motion , @xmath24 this system can be solved to obtain , @xmath25 after dropping the decaying mode , we can find the distance at which our particle decouples from the hubble flow through the condition @xmath26 or more specifically @xmath27 which yields , @xmath28 hence @xmath29 , which denotes the distance from the wake s center of the mass shell that turns - around at @xmath10 , is given by @xmath30    matter that turned around at a height @xmath31 will virialize at a radius @xmath32 showing that @xmath33 labels the width of the wake which contains four times the background density of matter .",
    "shells of infalling baryonic matter will collide with one another at the virial height and create shocks on either side of the wake as shown through hydrodynamical simulations @xcite . the energy of the falling particles will be thermalized in the wake giving a temperature @xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the speed of hydrogen particles of mass @xmath36 at the shock .",
    "a shell that turns around at time @xmath37 will hit the wake at @xmath38 , and therefore the speed will be given by @xmath39 which yields a wake temperature of @xmath40(g\\mu)^2_6 ( v_s \\gamma_s)^2\\frac{z_i+1}{z+1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 being the value of @xmath42 in units of @xmath43 .",
    "to compute the amount of matter accreted onto wakes , and eventually the mass function , we must understand how to model the network of wakes created from our scaling solution .",
    "as previously mentioned , we expect @xmath44 strings per hubble volume .",
    "the curvature radius of the long strings network grows in length relative to fixed comoving coordinates .",
    "this growth is realized because long string segments intersect and produce string loops .",
    "the string intercommutations occur roughly once per hubble expansion time per string per hubble volume .",
    "they also lead to a change of the direction of motion of a string after intersecting another string and exchanging ends .",
    "we will use a toy model introduced in @xcite to characterize the long string network analytically : we divide the time axis into hubble time steps . in each time step and in each hubble volume",
    "we lay down @xmath44 straight string segments of length @xmath45 where @xmath46 is less but close to unity , and each string has a velocity @xmath15 in a random direction .",
    "we take the string segments to be uncorrelated .",
    "each string segment lives for a hubble time .",
    "the string network at different hubble time steps is taken to be uncorrelated .",
    "wakes first form behind strings at the time of equal matter - radiation energy density @xmath47 , when matter perturbations can start to grow .",
    "we consider hubble time steps from @xmath47 to @xmath48 labelling them @xmath49 . at the beginning of each time step",
    "@xmath50 we create @xmath44 string segments , at the end of the time step we remove them . each of these strings will create a wake with initial dimensions @xmath51 ( where @xmath17 is the relativistic gamma factor associated with the string velocity @xmath15 ) which will then grow in planar dimensions due to the hubble expansion and in width via the matter accretion process discussed in the previous section .",
    "consider a redshift z , then the comoving number density of wakes laid down at time @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 therefore the mass density in all wakes at a redshift @xmath54 is given by summing the contribution from all the wakes created at different hubble time steps : @xmath55 where the last factor is the volume at redshift @xmath54 of the nonlinear region about a wake created at a redshift @xmath56 . since the planar dimensions of the wake expand with the hubble flow , we obtain @xmath57 in figure [ massfrac ] we plot the quantity @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 is the background energy density ) for the following parameter choices : @xmath60 where the value of @xmath61 is close to the current upper bound and the other values are taken to agree with those in recent cosmic string evolution simulations .",
    "this quantity represents the fraction of the total mass in the universe accreted onto wakes .",
    "+     fraction of the total matter in the universe that is in cosmic string wakes with parameters [ parameters ] at various redshifts.,scaledwidth=51.0% ]    figure [ massfrac ] shows that a considerable fraction of matter is accreted by wakes .",
    "let us analyze this a bit more carefully .",
    "small density perturbations on the surface of the wake will grow due to gravitational instability and might eventually cause the wake to fragment .",
    "the dynamics of this process will be quite complex due to the inner structure of the wake : the dark matter density peaks at the edges while baryonic matter clusters in the center @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the fragmentation was done in the simpler case of a static isothermal sheet - like cloud in @xcite .",
    "the timescale of the perturbation growth is of the order of the freefall time with the length of the most unstable mode equalling the sheet s width and the longest wavelength unstable mode being twice that . taking the very optimistic route and assuming our wake behaves in a similar way respectively @xcite . in this case",
    "one could argue that if perturbations grew as cylindrical or spherical objects , they would grow slower than the planar wake and therefore no clear fragmentation would occur . ] , long filaments of virial diameter @xmath62 should form in a similar fashion to the zeldovich pancakes .",
    "these filaments would subsequently break into beads themselves , again the fastest growing mode having a length @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "therefore the wakes will eventually fragment into virialized halos of size @xmath64 .    with this picture in mind",
    "we can compute the comoving number density of halos of mass greater than @xmath65 that fragments from the wakes created at redshift @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the heavyside step function .    taking into account the all wakes that exist at redshift @xmath54 we simply get @xmath69",
    "the collection of step functions given by the sum is a bit odd as a distribution since in reality this should be continuous . the discrepancy arises because of the model that considers the wakes to be instantaneously created while this process actually spans a hubble time .",
    "the part of a wake that is created close to time @xmath50 will have different properties than the part created at around @xmath70 which would be more similar to the beginning of the next set of wakes .",
    "hence we should smear out the distribution @xmath71 to have something realistic .",
    "to do this we fix @xmath54 and split the mass range in intervals @xmath72 $ ] with @xmath73 being the mass of the halo s formed at @xmath54 from a wake created at the hubble time step @xmath74 . since the values of @xmath75 are known , we can just interpolate to create a continuous @xmath71 .",
    "one can then obtain the comoving mass function from @xmath76 .    in figures [ figngtm ] and [ fighalomfcomov ] , we plot and compare @xmath71 and @xmath76 from our model to the standard predictions as found in reed et al .",
    "@xcite based on gaussian fluctuations in a standard @xmath77cdm model with cosmological parameters chosen to agree with those obtained from the wmap data .",
    "we use the string parameters given in equation [ parameters ] and note that the small wiggles in the plots of @xmath71 are just an artefact of our interpolation .",
    "we see from the figures that structures formed from primordial fluctuations dominate at redshifts smaller than @xmath78 , whereas the string wakes dominate at higher redshifts . one thing to note",
    "is that the mass function for gaussian perturbations is obtained using the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite which counts the small halos and their parent halos independently . for wakes ,",
    "we assume here that smaller halos get destroyed when they merge in the wake to create larger ones , and hence the tail end of the halo distribution could be larger than what we predict here .",
    "note that even if at some redshift the wake halos make up a decent fraction of the total halo number in the small mass region , objects of these sizes are hard to detect .",
    "therefore it will be challenging to probe this mass range directly with any decent precision .",

    "in this paper we have studied the formation of halos of dark matter by cosmic string wakes as a function of redshift .",
    "we have found that the relative importance of string wakes increases as the redshift increases . however , there are challenges in trying to detect these signals , and this is the topic we discuss in this section without giving too many details .",
    "the temperature of our halos can be estimated from the virial theorem and conservation of energy by considering a collapsing gas cloud of radius @xmath89 containing two times the background density @xmath90 , @xmath91 here , @xmath89 is the radius of our collapsing cloud from eq .",

    "star formation can occur if the temperatures are high enough so that colliding molecules can excite each other to higher energy states and radiate away their kinetic energy .",
    "atomic cooling requires @xmath96k while @xmath97 cooling has channels that can be efficient down to temperatures as low as @xmath98k .",
    "however these @xmath97 molecules are very fragile and get destroyed by the radiation of the first stars , and therefore this cooling mechanism alone will not allow for multiple stars to form in close proximity as would be the case for halos formed from wakes .",

    "however , even if each wake contains a lot of mass , it is spread over a large area and hence we would only obtain strong lensing if the background source lay , with us , very close to the plane delimited by a wake , in order to have enough mass along the integrated line of sight .",
    "this makes the signal too rare to be useful to statistically constrain string parameters .",
    "however , if one were lucky , assuming the images do not overlap , which could happen for extended source and a small @xmath42 or if we are not in the proximity of the wake s plane , a lensed source would appear as two images with no magnification or distortion . in such case",
    "one could hope to find other similarily lensed objects along some line in the sky .",
    "observables sensitive to the structures formed at high redshift would be ideal to differentiate and detect wake structures from the background .",
    "one such example , that relies on the compact objects , is gamma ray constraints from dense dark matter clumps @xcite .",
    "however , the formation of these objects must proceed by a clean radial infall of matter in order to have a sufficiently steep dark matter density profile to produce a detectable gamma - ray flux .",
    "these are not favorable conditions in the wake since we expect strong tidal forces as growing perturbations oscillate around the center .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that string wakes can dominate the nonlinear structures in the universe at sufficiently high redshifts . even at redshifts where they are not dominant",
    ", they may be identifiable because of the distinct spatial correlations which they induce .",
    "the string - induced halos are typically too small and cold to induce star formation , and hence it is a challenge to be able to find them observationally .",
