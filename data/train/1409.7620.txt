    "for collisional systems in which the mean free path is very small , particles remain close to local thermal equilibrium , and transport and collective motions can be described with a hydrodynamic treatment . because of the increasing mean free path with particle kinetic energy , the situation can already change for mean free path on the order of or longer than 1% of the length scale of plasma gradients @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to kinetic effects such as streaming plasmas and non - local transport , which are intensely studied because of their importance in many plasma environments , such as high - density laser - produced plasmas @xcite and astrophysical plasmas like the solar wind @xcite , solar atmosphere @xcite , solar flares @xcite , and supernovae @xcite .",

    "a gap in the center of the plasma is created by placing an opaque wire in the path of the ionizing beam , which results in two plasma hemispheres that stream into each other during plasma expansion .",
    "streaming plasmas are precursors to complex phenomena such as instabilities , shock waves , and solitons @xcite , and they have been studied in a wide variety of environments such as the solar wind @xcite , supernovae @xcite , double plasma devices @xcite , and laser - produced plasmas @xcite . a partially transmitting strip , instead of an opaque wire , was recently used to create a smaller amplitude density depletion in the plasma center @xcite .",

    "this allows us to interpret the spectrum as the distribution of ion velocities perpendicular to the gap by plotting the spectra versus velocity , where velocity is calculated as @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is the detuning of the fluorescence excitation laser from resonance and @xmath60 is the wavelength .",

    "[ fig : wholecloudspec]a shows the velocity distribution for the entire plasma sheet , which reflects directed ion motion ( plasma expansion or streaming ) and thermal ion motion . at early times , the distribution is unaffected by the existence of the gap , and the width reflects the ion temperature after disorder - induced heating ( dih ) @xcite .",
    "dih occurs as excess potential energy in the initially random ion spatial distribution is converted to ion kinetic energy .",
    "the timescale for dih is the inverse of the ion plasma oscillation frequency , @xmath63s , where @xmath64 is the ion mass .",
    "this is much faster than the hydrodynamic timescale on which the plasma reacts to density inhomogeneities .",
    "after dih , ion velocities increase as electron thermal energy is converted to directed ion motion through the hydrodynamic process discussed above .",
    "the distribution for a plasma without a gap broadens as the ions accelerate radially , but it retains a generally featureless gaussian shape characteristic of a self - similar expansion @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the perturbed plasma broadens more quickly and develops a bimodal shape .",
    "we will show below that bimodality reflects ions from the two sides of the gap streaming into the gap and through each other . this motion is still driven by the conversion of electron thermal energy into ion expansion energy , but it occurs on the timescale @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ fig : wholecloudspec]b shows spectra for the perturbed plasma at the same scaled time , @xmath55 and with velocity scaled by @xmath65 .",
    "the universality of the scaled data emphasizes how the gradient in the electron thermal pressure drives the dynamics .",

[ fig : regionspectra25 ] and [ fig : regionspectra105 ] for initial electron temperatures 25k and 105k respectively ) . due to the symmetry of our plasma with respect to the gap , corresponding regional spectra in the two hemispheres mirror each other .",

    "the dimensions of these regions are 190@xmath28 m perpendicular to the gap and 760@xmath28 m parallel to it .",
    "the shift of a distribution represents the mean velocity of an ion population , and the width represents the rms velocity spread @xcite .",
    "we typically quote the width in terms of an effective local temperature , but the width is also affected by spread in average ion velocity across the region and lack of thermal equilibrium .",

    "the solid lines are data with and without the gap while short dashed lines are fits to perturbed velocity distributions .",

    "far from the gap and especially at early times , the distribution shape , shift , and width are essentially unchanged by introduction of a gap .",
    "but there are dramatic differences between spectra of perturbed and unperturbed plasmas for inner regions .",
    "signal at positive velocities represent ions moving away from plasma center , whereas , negative velocities represent ions moving towards it .",
    "positive and negative velocity groups in region 0 indicate ions moving through the center of the gap .",
    "it is important to note that ions move through the regions , so spectra for a given region at different times may reflect different ions .",
    "for instance , neglecting collisions and given the dimension of the regions , particles in a particular region with mean velocity of 60 m/s , will be in a contiguous region in approximately @xmath67s .",
    "there are many common features in @xmath30k and @xmath31k data that illustrate the general behavior of streaming ultracold neutral plasmas . at early times ( @xmath68s )",
    ", the density gradient in regions 1 and 2 produces an acceleration of ions towards the gap .",
    "this is followed by the appearance of two beams of high velocity ions crossing each other in region 0 .",
    "the stream velocities closely match the characteristic velocity introduced earlier ( @xmath69 m/s and 50 m/s for 105k and 25k respectively ) .",
    "the bulk velocity of each population greatly exceeds the ion thermal speed and is comparable to the phase velocity of ion acoustic waves . at later times ( @xmath70s )",
    "these populations have crossed region 0 , and ions that originated on the other side of the gap now appear in regions 1 - 3 as ions moving away from the gap . these interpenetrating streams and local velocity distributions that can not be defined by a single maxwellian with a well - defined temperature are indicators that the plasma is in the kinetic regime .",
    "data from hydrodynamic plasmas studied in @xcite showed no deviation from local maxwellians .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : regionspectra25 ] and figs . [ fig : regionspectra105 ] , it is interesting to note that ion populations remain cold until they have passed through the gap , after which their velocity spread greatly increases ( fig .",

    "important differences between the data sets reflect the variation in electron thermal pressure .",
    "for example , moving populations appear sooner for @xmath31k ( @xmath71s ) than @xmath30k , and velocities are higher for higher @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velandtemperture ] ) .",
    "the ion temperature in region zero at later times is also hotter for @xmath31k than @xmath30k .",
    "there is also significant difference in the penetration depth of ions from one side into the plasma on the other side of the gap .",
    "we estimate the penetration length in the plasma from the farthest excursion of right - moving populations . for @xmath31k ,",
    "right - moving ions clearly appear in region 3 ( 10@xmath28s ) , while for @xmath30k right - moving ions appear in region 1 , and perhaps region 2 , and the population is less distinct than for @xmath31k .",
    "@xmath72k ( not shown ) displays intermediate behavior .",
    "no clear right - moving population can be found at times later than @xmath7310@xmath28s for any @xmath36 ( data not shown ) .",
    "one expects a greater penetration length for higher @xmath36 because the coulomb collision cross section decreases with collision velocity , @xmath74 . from these measurements",
    ", it should also be possible to estimate the stopping power of electrons and strongly coupled ions in an ultracold plasma for a penetrating ion stream @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations are included in figs .",
    "[ fig : regionspectra25 ] and figs . [ fig : regionspectra105 ] to emphasize the breakdown of the hydrodynamic approximation .",
    "but it is also interesting to note the nature of the discrepancy between the data and the simulation . in the central region ,",
    "when two symmetric , relatively cold , streaming plasma populations are present , the hydrodynamic code predicts a single cold population with zero average velocity , which is what one would expect given the constraint in the simulation of a local thermal equilibrium for the ions .",
    "however , in regions away from the center , the distributions from the hydrodynamic simulation are close the the distribution for the population of ions that have not crossed the gap , but the contributions from ions that have streamed across the gap are absent in the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "this reflects the inability of the hydrodynamic code to account for non - local transport .",
    "the hydrodynamic code also tends to underestimate the ion temperature at later times .     and [ fig : regionspectra25 ] .",

    "[ fig : regionspectra105 ] and [ fig : regionspectra25 ] ) to one or the sum of two voigt profiles .",
    "the voigt profile is the convolution of a lorentzian with homogeneous width @xmath77 and shifted gaussian for doppler effects @xcite . in this way",
    "we take spectral broadening due to the natural linewidth of the transition into account for quantitative analysis .",
    "as mentioned above , the temperature is extracted from the width of the gaussian .",

    "ion velocities and temperatures for the streams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : velandtemperture ] whenever they are resolvable . for higher @xmath36",
    "we obtain faster streaming velocities , which is consistent with the separation of the bimodal distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : wholecloudspec]a . in regions 1 and 2 ,",
    "populations that are moving into the gap ( negative velocities and middle panel ) appear to be relatively cold ( @xmath78k ) , while populations that have traveled across the gap and moved an appreciable distance through a counter - streaming plasma ( positive velocities and bottom panel ) , have higher temperatures ( @xmath79k ) .",
    "in the center , region 0 , particles moving to the left and right show very similar ion temperatures .    for all regions ,",
    "velocities decrease with time . decreasing plasma gradient and decreasing @xmath80 @xcite with time",
    "imply that ions moving through the gap at later times have experienced less acceleration during their trajectories than at early times .",
    "but velocities also decrease for an individual population as it moves through the regions .",
    "this may reflect that after ions move past the gap , the local electric field opposes the average motion for that population .",
    "damping or collisions may also play a role , which is supported by the considerably higher temperatures measured for populations that have crossed the gap .",
    "when only one distinct population of ions is visible in the velocity distribution function , such as in region 1 at early times ( @xmath81s ) , the hydrodynamic simulation does a reasonable job of predicting the average ion velocity ( [ fig : velandtemperture](top ) ) .",
    "when two streaming populations are present , however , such as in region 1 at later times or in region 0 , the velocity distribution is far outside the regime that can be treated by a hydrodynamic treatment .",
    "the simulation tends to track close to the average velocity , which is always zero in region 0 .",
    "similarly , in regions farther from the gap ( region 2 ) , the temperature in the simulation agrees reasonably well with the temperature of the population moving towards the gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velandtemperture](middle ) ) , indicating these ions are relatively unaffected by the small population of high velocity ions that have crossed the gap and are streaming through the region .",
    "this highlights the phenomena that characterize departure from the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "in this work we have used the ability to create streaming populations of particles in ultracold neutral plasmas to demonstrate the crossover from hydrodynamic to kinetic behavior and predominantly kinetic behavior .",
    "this work is complimentary to a recent paper in which we studied plasmas with a similar initial geometry in the hydrodynamic regime @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the ion mean free path to the length scale of plasma inhomogeneities as ions move through the gap and the populations collide is the crucial parameter for determining the regime of behavior , and it can be tuned by varying the ion density in the gap and the electron temperature , which changes the stream velocity .",
    "the hydrodynamic regime is characterized by a density enhancement at the confluence of the plasma streams , gap splitting , and localized density depletions that propagate away from the initial gap .",
    "the kinetic regime lacks these features and displays velocity distributions that strongly deviate from local thermal equilibrium and show distinct populations of interpenetrating , counter - streaming plasmas .",
    "there are many future directions in which this work can go .",
    "this study has focused on a qualitative description of plasma behavior in the various regimes , but it would be informative to quantitatively map the boundary between different regimes in the parameter space of stream velocity and plasma density in the gap .",
    "one could use , for example , the appearance of streaming populations or visibility of a localized density enhancement in the confluence region as an indicator of the plasma regime .",
    "a full kinetic description will allow a much more detailed and quantitative discussion of the observed effects .",
    "alternatively , data such as this can provide a stringent test of kinetic codes .",
    "kinetic codes , however , are much more computationally intensive . rather than move to a full kinetic description ,",
    "a common strategy is to generalize transport coefficients in order to extend the usefulness of hydrodynamic treatments .",
    "this is often done to treat nonlocal transport in plasmas with low collisionality , in which particle and energy fluxes at a given location are affected by conditions in distant regions of the plasma , which represents an important and complex problem .",
