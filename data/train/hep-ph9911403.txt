    "during the last fifteen years it has become clear that the applicability of the skyrme s topological soliton model for baryon structure@xcite goes beyond all the original expectations .",
    "indeed , this model provides a very useful framework to investigate not only the structure of non - strange baryons and their interactions@xcite , but of strange hyperons as well . in this type of models , baryons emerge as soliton configurations of the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the corresponding non - linear chiral action describes the main features of qcd at low energies .",
    "when the model is extended to the strange sector , and in order to account for the non - negligible strange quark mass , appropriate chiral symmetry breaking terms have to be included .",
    "one can treat the resulting effective action by starting from a flavor symmetric formulation wherein non  vanishing kaon fields arise from a rigid rotation of the classical pion field .",
    "the associated collective coordinates , which parametrize these large amplitude fluctuations off the soliton , are canonically quantized to generate states which possess the quantum numbers of physical hyperons .",
    "it turns out that the resulting collective hamiltonian can be diagonalized exactly even in the presence of flavor symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to a good description of the hyperon spectra , magnetic moments , etc ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "consequently , it provides an alternative and interesting scheme to investigate other various hyperon properties . in the present contribution we will concentrate on the application of the model to the study of the electromagnetic decays of the decuplet baryons and of the non - leptonic weak decays of the octet hyperons .",
    "the study of the decuplet baryon radiative decays is of great interest at the present time due to the upcoming experiments at jlab@xcite .",
    "in fact , although recently the reaction @xmath2 has carefully been analyzed at mami , the decay parameters are still unknown for those @xmath3 to @xmath4 transitions which involve strange baryons .",
    "the experiments at jlab are expected to provide some data on these radiative decays soon and thus give more insight in the pattern of flavor symmetry breaking .",
    "theoretical studies of these decays have been performed in a number of quark - based models like i.e. the non  relativistic quark model @xcite , a quenched lattice calculation @xcite , etc . here , we report the corresponding results in the skyrme model . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - leptonic weak decays of hyperons represent a long - standing problem in hadron physics .",
    "for example , although quark models with qcd enhancement factors have been quite successful in predicting @xmath0-wave decay amplitudes ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) , they have serious difficulties in reproducing the empirical @xmath1-wave amplitudes .",
    "indeed , this is a problem ( so - called `` @xmath0-wave/@xmath1-wave puzzle '' ) which seems to be common to other approaches as e.g. heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory@xcite . within the context of the topological soliton models a possible solution to this problem",
    "has been suggested rather long ago@xcite .",
    "it was shown that in the skyrme model , in addition to the standard pole terms , the @xmath1-wave amplitudes receive extra contributions from contact terms .",
    "unfortunately , at the time this suggestion was made the model was hampered by several serious problems , like e.g. very poor predictions for the hyperon spectrum@xcite , far too small results for the @xmath0-wave non - leptonic decay amplitudes@xcite , etc .",
    "consequently , it was hard to draw definite conclusions about the real relevance of such contact terms . as mentioned above the introduction of a more refined version of the model",
    "has led to the solution of such problems .",
    "in fact , it has been recently shown@xcite that the correct @xmath0-wave absolute values can be naturally obtained within such scheme .",
    "thus , we are now in position to verify whether chiral soliton models can provide a unified and consistent description of the hyperon non - leptonic decays .",
    "the strategy is to use an effective chiral lagrangian to describe the weak interactions . assuming that the corresponding low energy constants are fixed to describe the known @xmath5 meson decay amplitudes , the hyperon weak matrix elements",
    "are then evaluated using the topological soliton model wave functions .",
    "the rest of this contribution is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we give a brief description of the collective coordinate approach to the @xmath6 skyrme model . in sec .",
    "3 we present our predictions concerning the radiative decays of the decuplet baryons within this approach . in sec .",
    "4 we describe how to evaluate the non - leptonic hyperon decays and give our results for the @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave decay amplitudes .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "5 some conclusions are given .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in the skyrme model baryons appear as topological excitations of a chiral effective action which depends only on meson fields . in the present work ,",
    "the following effective action is used @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the skyrme action @xmath9 +   { 1\\over{32 \\epsilon^2 } }   \\mbox{tr}\\left [ [ u^\\dagger \\partial_\\mu u , u^\\dagger \\partial_\\nu u]^2\\right ] \\right\\ } \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath10 is the dimensionless skyrme parameter .",
    "furthermore the chiral field @xmath11 is the non  linear realization of the pseudoscalar octet .",
    "@xmath12 is the wess - zumino action @xmath13 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the number of colors .",
    "finally , @xmath16 represents the symmetry breaking terms @xmath17 + \\sqrt{3 }   { f_\\pi^2 m_\\pi^2 - f_k^2 m_k^2 \\over{6 } } \\mbox{tr } \\left [ \\lambda_8 \\left ( u + u^\\dagger \\right ) \\right ] \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad   \\left . + { f_k^2 - f_\\pi^2\\over{12 } } \\mbox{tr } \\left [ ( 1- \\sqrt{3 } \\lambda_8 ) \\left ( u ( \\partial_\\mu u)^\\dagger \\partial^\\mu u + u^\\dagger \\partial_\\mu u ( \\partial^\\mu u)^\\dagger \\right ) \\right ] \\right\\ } \\ , . \\label{sb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath18 is the kaon decay constant while @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the pion and kaon masses , respectively . in all our numerical calculations below we",
    "will take @xmath21 and the rest of the parameters appearing in @xmath22 to their empirical values .    in the soliton picture",
    "we are using the strong interaction properties of the low  lying @xmath23 and @xmath24 baryons are computed following the standard @xmath6 collective coordinate approach to the skyrme model .",
    "we introduce the ansatz @xmath25 for the chiral field . here",
    ", @xmath26 is the chiral angle which parameterizes the soliton .",
    "the collective rotation matrix @xmath27 is @xmath6 valued . substituting the configuration eq.([ansatz ] ) into @xmath22 yields ( upon canonical quantization of @xmath28 ) the collective hamiltonian @xmath29-\\frac{3}{8\\theta_k } + \\phi \\ \\left ( 1 - d_{88 } \\right ) \\ . \\label{slowham}\\ ] ] in eq ( [ slowham ] ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the moments of inertia in the pionic and kaonic directions , respectively , and @xmath32 the symmetry breaking strength ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "@xmath33 denotes the spin operator while @xmath34 $ ] refers to the quadratic casimir operator of @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the collective hamiltonian are identified as the baryon wavefunctions @xmath35 and masses @xmath36 . due to the symmetry breaking terms in @xmath16",
    "this hamiltonian is obviously not @xmath6 symmetric .",
    "as shown by yabu and ando @xcite it can , however , be diagonalized exactly .",
    "this diagonalization essentially amounts to admixtures of states from higher dimensional @xmath6 representations into the octet ( @xmath4 ) and decuplet ( @xmath3 ) states .",
    "this procedure has proven to be quite successful in describing the hyperon spectrum and static properties @xcite .",
    "to study the hyperon radiative decays one has to introduce the electromagnetic field @xmath37 in the effective action described in the previous section .",
    "this is accomplished by replacing the usual derivatives @xmath38 appearing in @xmath8 and @xmath16 by covariant derivatives .",
    "these covariant derivatives are defined as @xmath39 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the electric charge matrix @xmath41 . in the case of wess - zumino action @xmath12 ,",
    "the gauging procedure is slightly more complicated since extra terms have to be added in order to ensure gauge invariance .",
    "details of this procedure as well as the explicit form of the gauged wess - zumino action can be found in e.g. ref.@xcite .",
    "the resulting gauged effective action can be cast in the following form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the hadron e.m .",
    "current and @xmath44 is a tensor which is responsible , for example , of the seagull contributions to the hadron polarizabilities . for the calculation of the radiative",
    "decays only the second term in eq.([gauged ] ) is relevant .    for the e.m .",
    "decays of the decuplet hyperons we are interested in both @xmath45 and @xmath46 transitions are allowed .",
    "the corresponding partial widths can be expressed in terms of @xmath43 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the photon momentum and @xmath49 are the spherical bessel functions .    in our model ,",
    "the general form of @xmath50 can be directly obtained from the gauged effective action .",
    "using the ansatz eq.([ansatz ] ) one can then get the explicit expression of the integrands in eqs.([ge2],[gm1 ] ) .",
    "these expressions can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that in deriving eq.([ge2 ] ) some approximations according to the siegert s theorem have been made .",
    "the impact of such approximations on the e2@xmath51 transition has been recently studied in the two flavor reduction of the model@xcite .",
    "it turns out that the kinematical corrections coming from the low - momentum expansion of the bessel functions are of the order of 5 % .",
    "in addition to this , pion fluctuations off the rotating soliton have to be included to consistently satisfy the continuity equation @xmath52 at subleading order in @xmath53 .",
    "these induced fields account for shortcomings in the collective quantization and give corrections of @xmath54% for the @xmath55 case .",
    "unfortunately such an inclusion of induced fields seems to be unfeasible in the three flavor model with symmetry breaking included . in any case , since the decuplet decays are almost completely m1dominated , these uncertainties do not affect the total decay widths in any significant way .",
    "results for the total decay widths are given in table 1 .",
    "there we list the corresponding widths normalized to the @xmath55 value . as in the case of magnetic moments ,",
    "the calculated @xmath55 transition amplitude turns to be roughly @xmath56 smaller than the empirical value .",
    "however , it has been recently shown that in the @xmath57 model the inclusion of next - to - leading order quantum corrections solves not only the nucleon mass problem , but also that of the magnetic moments@xcite .",
    "similar improvements are expected in the present model . from table 1",
    "we observe that the predictions of the present model are very similar to those of quark - based models .",
    "in particular , in both types of models the @xmath58spin selection rules that predict small @xmath59 and @xmath60 are rather well satisfied .",
    "._total decay widths normalized to that of the @xmath61 transition in various models .",
