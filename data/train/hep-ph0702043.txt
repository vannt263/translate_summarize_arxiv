    "lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions are rich from the theoretical point of view since they exist at the loop level and the measurable quantities of these decays carry considerable information about the free parameters of the model used .",
    "in addition to this , they are clean theoretically because they are free from the nonperturbative effects .",
    "the experimental work done stimulate the theoretical studies on lfv decays .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 processes are among the lfv decays and the experimental the current limits for their branching ratios ( br ) have been predicted as @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite , respectively .    in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) the theoretical values of the brs of lfv interactions are extremely small .",
    "therefore , one search new models beyond the sm to enhance these numerical values and the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , with flavor changing neural currents ( fcnc ) at tree level , is one of the candidate . in this model ,",
    "the lfv interactions are induced by the internal neutral higgs bosons @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the help of the yukawa couplings , appearing as free parameters , which can be determined by the experimental data .",
    "the present work is devoted to the analysis of @xmath8 , @xmath9 decay in the 2hdm with the inclusion of a single extra dimension , respecting the randall sundrum model ( see @xcite and @xcite for the calculation of the br of the same decay in the 2hdm without and with flat extra dimensions ) . here",
    ", the lfv transition @xmath10 is driven by the internal scalar bosons @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the internal z boson connects this transition to the @xmath11 output ( see fig . [ fig1ver ] ) .    the hierarchy problem between weak and planck scales",
    "could be explained by introducing the extra dimensions .",
    "the model introduced by randall and sundrum @xcite ( the rs1 model ) is related to the non - factorizable geometry where the gravity is localized in a 4d brane , so called planck ( hidden ) brane , which is away from another 4d brane , which is the visible ( tev ) brane where we live . in this scenario , the hierarchy is generated by the warped factor , which is an exponential function of the compactified radius in the extra dimension .",
    "there are other scenarios based on the rs1 background in the literature @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite",
    "the behavior of @xmath12 gauge boson , accessible to the extra dimension in the rs1 background , has been studied and it was observed that the massless mode was not localized in the extra dimension .",
    "furthermore , it was obtained that the kk excitations have large couplings to boundaries and this was not a phenomenologically favorable scenario since , for a perturbative theory , it would have been necessary to push the visible scale to energies greater than tev .",
    "to have a zero mode localized in the bulk and to get small couplings of kk modes with the boundaries , the idea of brane localized mass terms has been considered for scalar fields @xcite .",
    "these terms could change the boundary conditions to get a zero mode localized solution . in @xcite ,",
    "the bulk fermions were considered in the rs1 background .",
    "@xcite was devoted to a extensive work on the bulk fields in various multi - brane models . in @xcite , the @xmath12 gauge field with bulk and boundary mass terms",
    "were taken into account and only the @xmath0 gauge field was considered as localized in the bulk .    in this work ,",
    "we study the effects of localization of the @xmath0 gauge boson around the visible brane and analyze the contributions of the kk modes of z bosons on the brs of the lfv @xmath13 decay , by following the idea that the @xmath0 gauge field is accessible to the extra dimension in the rs1 background and the other particles , including the new higgs doublet lie on the visible brane .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the theoretical expression for the decay width of the lfv decay @xmath14 , @xmath9 , in the framework of the 2hdm by considering the non zero localization of the @xmath0 gauge in the rs1 background .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions . in appendix a , we present the model construction .",
    "appendix b is devoted to the explicit expressions of the functions appearing in the general effective vertex for the interaction of off - shell z - boson with a fermionic current .",
    "lfv @xmath15 decay exists at least in the one loop level and , therefore , the physical quantities , like the br , contain rich information about the model used and the free parameters existing . in the version of the 2hdm with the fcncs at tree level ,",
    "the lfv interactions exist with larger brs , compared to ones obtained in the extended sm with massive neutrinos .",
    "these decays are driven by the yukawa interaction lagrangian and the strength of the interaction is controlled by the new yukawa couplings .",
    "the additional effects coming from the possible extra dimension(s ) bring new contributions to the brs of these decays and , in the present work , we study these effects by assuming that the @xmath0 gauge boson is accessible to the extra dimension and is localized on the visible brane , in the rs1 background .    the rs1 model is a higher dimensional scenario that is based on a non - factorizable geometry and the hierarchy is generated by the warped factor , which is an exponential function of the compactified radius in the extra dimension .",
    "this model is based on the idea that the gravity is localized on the so called hidden brane , which is one of the boundary of the @xmath16 orbifold extra dimension , and extended into the bulk with varying strength , however , the sm fields live in another brane , the so called visible brane , which is the other boundary of the extra dimension . in this scenario ,",
    "the 5d cosmological constant is non vanishing and both branes have equal and opposite tensions so that the low energy effective theory has flat 4d spacetime .",
    "the metric of such 5d world reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the bulk curvature constant , @xmath19 is the compactification radius , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the warp factor which causes that all the mass terms are rescaled on the visible brane for @xmath22 . with the rough estimate , @xmath23 , all mass terms are bring down to the tev scale .",
