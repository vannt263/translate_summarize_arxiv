    "apart from the high transition temperature of 40k @xcite , two - band superconductivity was the other unexpected phenomenon in mgb@xmath0 which attracts increasing attention .",
    "in fact , at present it appears that mgb@xmath0 is the only superconductor with substantiated theoretical and experimental evidence for two - band superconductivity .",
    "historically , two - band superconductivity has already been investigated theoretically shortly after the formulation of bcs theory .",
    "suhl , matthias and walker @xcite suggested a model for transition metals considering overlapping @xmath4- and @xmath5-bands . at the same time , moskalenko proposed an extension of bcs theory for multiple bands @xcite . a review of theoretical treatment of the critical temperature @xmath6 of multiband superconductors may be found in ref ..    in the early sixties there have been experimental claims for the observation of two - band superconductivity in some transition metals like e.g.  v , nb and ta @xcite and later in oxygen depleted srtio@xmath7 @xcite .    until now",
    ", mgb@xmath0 appears to be first system for which multi - band superconductivity has independently been evidenced by several experimental techniques like , for example , heat capacity , tunneling spectroscopy , raman spectroscopy , penetration depth measurements , arpres , and the analysis of the critical fields @xcite .",
    "the theoretical justification for two - band superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 has been given from electronic structure calculations @xcite .",
    "these find that the fermi surface contains two quasi - cylindrical sheets corresponding to nearly two - dimensional @xmath1-bands .",
    "a three dimensional network of the fermi surface is attributed to the @xmath2-bands .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the optical bond stretching @xmath8 phonons couple strongly to the holes at the top of @xmath1-bands while the three - dimensional @xmath2-electrons couple only weakly to the phonons .",
    "the different coupling strengths of the @xmath1- and @xmath2-bands lead to superconducting gaps different in character and size @xcite .",
    "using linear response theory it is possible to calculate the electron - phonon coupling ( eliashberg functions ) from first principles .",
    "the superconducting gaps obtained from eliashberg theory are in very good agreement with the experiments @xcite .",
    "interband scattering from impurities will complicate this picture because interband scattering leads to a decrease of @xmath9 and finally to a single order parameter @xcite .",
    "interband scattering is weak in mgb@xmath0 @xcite , but this is not necessarily the case in samples in which mg has been replaced by al or b by c ( ref . ) or which have been exposed to neutron irradiation @xcite .",
    "such samples exhibit considerably reduced @xmath9 , while the two gaps persist even at very low critical temperatures .",
    "recently it was shown that the @xmath9 reduction in mgb@xmath0 due to al or c doping can be explained mainly as due to a simple effect of band filling @xcite .",
    "a similar observation has been made using a phenomenological weak - coupling approach@xcite .",
    "further , the doping independent @xmath2-gap in c - doped mgb@xmath0 can be understood as due to a compensation of band filling and interband scattering effects .",
    "thermodynamic properties of anisotropic superconductors in the weak coupling regime were extensively studied in the past . in the case of weak anisotropy",
    "the bcs model was extended by pokrovsky @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the specific heat jump at @xmath6 is reduced as compared to the isotropic case . for two - band",
    "weakly coupled superconductors the specific heat was calculated by several authors moscal91,palistrant92,sodawada , geilikman , shensonphil , kresin73,chi , mishonov , ramunni , nakai , kristof , watanabe ( for a recent review see also ref . ) .",
    "the main prediction is that at @xmath6 the relative jump in the electronic specific heat , @xmath10 , is reduced as compared to the universal bcs value of 1.43 . on the other hand , for an isotropic strongly coupled superconductor the relative specific heat jump is larger than 1.43 ( see e.g.  the review in ref . ) .",
    "the combined effect of strong coupling and multiband anisotropy on the specific heat was studied earlier by the present authors @xcite , where the results of the first principles calculations of the electron - phonon interaction in mgb@xmath0 were used but the effect of interband impurity scattering was not considered .",
    "recently strong - coupling corrections were taken into account in the so - called two - square - well approximation ( separable model ) @xcite , where the effect of interband scattering on some thermodynamic functions was studied @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we formulate a generalized description of the thermodynamics of multiband superconductors taking into account impurity scattering ( magnetic and nonmagnetic ) in the framework of two - band eliashberg theory .",
    "the results are applied to mgb@xmath0 using the first principles band - structure results for the electronic spectra and electron - phonon interaction @xcite by extending our preceding approach @xcite .",
    "the superconducting energy gaps , the free energy , the entropy and the heat capacity for varying nonmagnetic interband scattering rates are calculated within the framework of two - band eliashberg theory .",
    "it will be shown that the expression for the thermodynamic potential on the extremal trajectory corresponding to solutions of the eliashberg equations has the form of the sum of contributions of @xmath1- and @xmath2-bands , but that only the total thermodynamic potential ( the sum of both contributions ) has physical meaning .    in a second step ,",
    "we perform a comparison of the phenomenological two - band @xmath3-model with the eliashberg results and apply a fit program developed for the @xmath3-model to extract the gaps and the sommerfeld constants from the eliashberg results .",
    "good agreement of the two band @xmath3-model with the eliashberg data is found for the temperature dependence of total heat capacity , the entropy and the free energy and the gaps .",
    "there are , however , distinct deviations in the partial contributions to the individual quantities and the sommerfeld constants obtained from the fits .",
    "we conclude that the phenomenological @xmath3-model approach can be taken as a handy tool to analyze e. g. experimental heat capacity data and the gaps to a satisfying accuracy , however that care must be taken for other quantities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the introduction to the formalism and the method of solution is given , in section iii numerical results for the densities of states ( dos ) and various thermodynamic quantities as a function of interband impurity scattering rate are discussed , in section iv the comparison of the two - band @xmath3-model with the eliashberg results is performed . in the appendix a general expression for the thermodynamic potential of a multiband superconductor with nonmagnetic impurities is derived .",

    "in summary , using the eliashberg approach , we have studied the behavior of the superconducting density of states , energy gaps , free energy , entropy and specific heat in a strongly - coupled two - band superconductor with interband impurity scattering .",

    "as demonstrated recently , the decrease of @xmath88 can rather be understood in terms of a band filling effect due to the electron doping by al and c and a concomitant scaling of the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath176 by the variation of the density of states as a function of electron doping @xcite .",
    "compensation of band filling and interband scattering effects shifts the merging point of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gaps to higher doping concentrations and lower @xmath88 s than expected based on interband scattering considerations alone . only the combination of interband scattering with band filling effects allowed us to model the nearly constant @xmath2 gap and the decreased critical temperature and increased doping concentrations at which the @xmath1 and @xmath2 gaps finally merge .",
