    "in recent years , higher - order operators have become the object of intense study in the search for possible effects of lorentz invariance violation @xcite .",
    "these planck - mass suppressed higher - order operators allows to describe new physics beyond those obtainable from renormalizable operators , that is , operators with mass dimension four or less @xcite .",
    "for example , the higher - order effective theory may involve additional degrees of freedom associated to ultra - high energies which do not converge perturbatively to the normal ones when taking the limit of the dimensionless parameters in the effective terms to zero .",
    "lee and wick studied these exotic modes in the context of negative metric theories @xcite and in spite of the ghost states that appear , they showed that unitarity can be preserved by demanding all stable particles to be positive norm states @xcite .    here",
    "we check perturbative unitarity in a qed consisting of higher - order myers and pospelov photons @xcite and standard fermions .",
    "the myers - pospelov lagrangian density for photons is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a four - vector defining a preferred reference frame , @xmath2 is the planck mass and @xmath3 is a dimensionless parameter",
    ".    we can always select a real basis of four - vectors @xmath4 to be orthonormal and to satisfy the properties described in ref .  . in analogy with the left and right handed polarizations of usual electrodynamics",
    "we can switch to a basis of complex four - vectors @xmath5 and define the orthogonal projectors @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 . to derive the dispersion relation",
    "we can expand the gauge field in term of this complex basis and replace in the equations of motion to arrive at @xmath9 in agreement with the work in ref .  .",
    "here we check perturbative unitarity in the process of electron - positron scattering @xmath10 . for this",
    "we use the optical theorem which relates the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath11 with the total cross section as @xmath12 where the sum runs over all intermediate physical states .    considering the qed extension model",
    "the amplitudes that contribute to the @xmath13-matrix are the direct amplitude @xmath14 and the exchange amplitude @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and where @xmath20 is the usual fermionic normalization constant .",
    "let us start with the left hand side of the unitarity condition ( [ unitarity ] ) .",
    "a similar calculation has been given in the minimal sector of the standard - model extension , see ref .  .",
    "to simplify we will consider the lightlike case where we have a ghost state with frequencies @xmath21 and two photons with frequencies @xmath22 , see ref .  , and the propagator @xmath23 where and we have included the @xmath24 prescription .",
    "we are interested in the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude , therefore let us set @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , we can see that the direct process does not contribute since the virtual photon can never be on shell for non - zero external momenta , hence @xmath27=0 $ ] .",
    "let us find the contribution of the exchange process and substitute the propagator ( [ propagator ] ) in ( [ amplitud2 ] ) @xmath28 because only the poles can contribute to the imaginary part and due to energy conservation encoded in @xmath29 , we have that only the positive poles of the virtual photon have a chance to contribute .",
    "we can discard the ghost contribution since its energy @xmath30 lies beyond the region of validity of the effective theory .",
    "that is , the external fermions will always satisfy the condition @xmath31 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath32\\nonumber \\\\&= & - e^2   \\int d k^0 \\int \\frac{d^3 \\vec k}{(2\\pi)^3}\\delta^4(p_1+p_2-k )           v^{\\mu } v^ { * \\nu } \\sum_{\\lambda}\\frac {     p^{\\lambda}_{\\mu \\nu }   \\delta ( k_0-\\omega_1^{\\lambda } ) } { 2g\\lambda ( k_0-\\omega_0^{\\lambda } ) ( k_0- \\omega_2^{\\lambda } ) } , \\nonumber \\\\   & = & e^2\\int \\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\pi)^3    } \\delta^4(p_1+p_2-k )       v^{\\mu }    v^ { * \\nu } \\sum_{\\lambda } \\frac {   \\varepsilon_{\\mu}^{\\lambda }   \\varepsilon_{\\nu}^{*\\lambda } } { 2g\\lambda    ( \\omega_1^{\\lambda}-\\omega_0^{\\lambda } )   ( \\omega_1^{\\lambda}-\\omega_2^{\\lambda } ) } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int \\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\delta^2(p_1+p_2-k )    \\sum_{\\lambda }    \\left| \\mathcal   m_{\\lambda } \\right|^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the notation @xmath33 for the physical process @xmath34 and we have introduced the normalization constant @xmath35 . finally we have @xmath36= \\int \\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\delta^2(p_1+p_2-k )     \\left| \\mathcal   m_{\\rm phys } \\right|^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and therefore the unitarity condition is satisfied in this scattering process .",
    "with an explicit calculation we have verified that the unitarity condition in the process of electron - positron scattering at tree level order is satisfied .",
    "a next step is to verify unitarity to order @xmath37 that will require to analyze more diagrams .",
    "some of them contain loops where the ghosts can appear off - shell , thus , introducing an extra difficulty .",
    "checking the unitarity condition to these order will give us a robust support in order to make physical predictions in the theory .",
