    "in this article , my guideline was to work out how two - band superconductivity shows up in experiment . to be more precise , my intention was to provide a literature overview on a multitude of effects by which conjectural two - band materials have been identified .",
    "furthermore , it was also my intention to compare these effects with those expected from other models , such as the anisotropic single - band and the d - wave scenario and thus to find out which effects are unique to and hence unambiguously mark out two - band superconductivity .",
    "two - band superconductivity has been a prominent issue since the discovery of mgb@xmath0 in 2001 @xcite , though it was sometimes considered for describing the unconventional behavior of materials before . in mgb@xmath0 numerous experiments revealed unconventional results such as a positive curvature of the upper critical field near the transition temperature , a shoulder in the specific heat at intermediate temperatures , and different anisotropies for different quantities .",
    "those significant deviations from the expected ( standard ) single - band behavior initiated profound theoretical investigations of the two - band scenario .",
    "accordingly , mgb@xmath0 has formed today s understanding of two - band superconductivity , and many effects have mainly been investigated for parameters close to those of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "today the focus has shifted to the iron - based superconductors .",
    "though there is little doubt that these materials are two- or even multi - band superconductors , their unconventional behavior is partly quite different from that of mgb@xmath0 , which may be due to quite different fermi surfaces and gap structures .",
    "theoretical work on the iron - based materials is yet largely missing but is anticipated to provide further impact on our knowledge of multi - band effects . beside these two major players , other materials ,",
    "partly known much longer than mgb@xmath0 , have been found to resemble mgb@xmath0 in some properties and have thus been supposed to be two - band materials .",
    "unconventional behavior does not necessarily mean two - band behavior but can also emerge from strong anisotropy in single - band materials , from gap - symmetries different from s - wave , from a second superconducting phase , and from other effects .",
    "it is therefore a major task of this paper to point out that features originating from two - band effects are often similar to those from other effects , which often makes distinguishing the scenarios difficult .",
    "this holds , for instance , for quantities that mainly depend on the variation of the gap values or the fermi velocities , as such a variation is available in both , the anisotropic single - band and the two - band scenario .",
    "nevertheless , differences are expected to show up in some properties , particularly when they are examined as a function of magnetic field , since in two - band materials superconductivity is often suppressed in one of the bands at sufficiently high magnetic fields .",
    "apart from the introduction ( i ) and the final summary ( v ) , the review contains three main sections : ( ii ) multi - band models , where some theoretically predicted results calculated by applying different models are summarized , ( iii ) experiments , where two - band effects observed in some selected experiments are reviewed , and ( iv ) materials , where most of the presumed two - band superconductors are listed .",
    "this section is devoted to the theoretical description of two - band superconductivity by applying ginzburg landau theory , the separable model , bcs , and eliashberg theory .",
    "we are mainly interested in the predictions of how experimentally accessible magnetic and thermodynamic superconducting properties are influenced by the presence of a second band .",
    "properties of the anisotropic single - band and the d - wave model are partly discussed for comparison .",
    "the two - band model is assumed to consist of two basically independent fermi bands , which differ in their properties . in particular , the coupling strength and",
    "thus the energy gaps should be distinctly different for the two bands . moreover , different fermi velocities , anisotropies , gap symmetries , impurity scattering rates , densities of states , etc .",
    "are possible .",
    "the two bands are connected by interband coupling and impurity scattering .",
    "because of the interaction , the system should have only one transition temperature ( @xmath1 ) , one upper critical field ( @xmath2 ) , etc .",
    ", and the values of the common characteristic properties should differ from both values of the single ( unconnected ) bands .",
    "the formal extension to a multi - band model with more than two bands and connections between all of them is a straightforward process . in experiment ,",
    "such conditions may be met by materials , whose fermi surface is crossed by two or more unconnected bands on which the energy gaps are distinctly different . in contrast , the anisotropic single - band model is assumed to consist of one band on which the energy gap and the fermi velocity vary rather continuously between a maximum and a minimum value .",
    "this may fit to materials , in which the superconducting parts are connected .",
    "let us start with the two - band ginzburg landau model @xcite which provides insight into superconducting parameters directly accessible to experiment .",
    "deriving the free energy ginzburg landau functional from a two - band bcs model , zhitomirsky and dao @xcite found @xmath3 with @xmath4 with @xmath5 the index of the individual bands , @xmath6 the magnetic induction , and @xmath7 the corresponding vector potential ; @xmath8 ( @xmath9tma@xmath10 ) denotes the vacuum permeability and @xmath11 ( @xmath12vs ) the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "@xmath13 is the order parameter of the superconducting state of each band .",
    "finally , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are numerical coefficients expressed by bcs quantities .",
    "it was shown that @xmath14 deviates from the single - band definition by a constant that depends on the inter- and intraband coupling strengths ( cf . also @xcite ) .",
    "possible dependencies of the quantities on the spatial coordinates and temperature are omitted in the equations .",
    "expression ( [ eqn : gl_fi2 ] ) represents a josephson - like interband interaction with coupling parameter @xmath17 .",
    "this term ensures minimal coupling and is responsible for a common single transition temperature of the system , usually larger than the transition temperatures of both individual bands ( i.e. the transition temperatures of the two bands when coupling is not present ) , and a single value of the critical fields .",
    "several groups added additional coupling terms @xcite or extended the ginzburg landau functional @xcite to higher orders of @xmath18 to extend the validity of the model to lower temperatures . in @xcite , the applicability of the two - band ginzburg landau model with the minimal coupling term",
    "was studied by comparing the results with those from the eilenberger equations .",
    "the authors found reliable agreement from the transition temperature to quite low temperatures , particularly in case of weak interband coupling and/or when adjustable parameters ( i.e. for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) are used instead of the microscopically derived values .",
    "the issue of the validity of the two - band ginzburg landau theory for mgb@xmath0 was also addressed in @xcite , where an interval from about 30k to @xmath19 ( @xmath20k ) was derived .",
    "if interband coupling is weak in comparison to the intraband properties , traces of the individual bands are likely to be observable in various thermodynamic or magnetic properties .",
    "in such a case , experiment may allow us to uncover two - band superconductivity .",
    "different effects of two - band superconductivity on such experimentally accessible properties have been calculated within the ginzburg landau model and were shown to resemble some of the unconventional experimental results .",
    "note , however , that not only two - band superconductivity leads to unconventional behavior , as will be shown in the next subsection .    in reference  @xcite",
    ", the two - band ginzburg landau equations were expressed in terms of more conventional quantities such as the condensation energies of each band and the magnetic penetration depths .",
    "fitting this model to experimental data of mgb@xmath0 allowed the authors to determine various ginzburg landau properties of the individual bands and of the total system .",
    "it was shown that the superconducting properties of the band with the smaller gap are suppressed by a rather low magnetic field , which is the reason for significant deviations of the in - field behavior of various properties from the single - band behavior .",
    "the field above which superconductivity is significantly suppressed in one of the bands is often assumed the upper critical field of this band , but due to interband coupling , traces of superconductivity should be available in this band up to the global upper critical field .",
    "further properties derived from ginzburg landau theory are the upper and lower critical fields , the characteristic lengths , and the corresponding anisotropies as well as thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "for example , it was demonstrated that a positive curvature of the upper critical field near the transition temperature may result from two - band superconductivity @xcite .",
    "this would also result in a temperature dependent anisotropy , which could be quite different from that of the magnetic penetration depth @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a second band was found to reduce the jump of the specific heat @xcite at the transition temperature , and aspects of point defect scattering were investigated @xcite .    in summary , the two - band ginzburg landau theory is a typical example of a simple two - band model , namely the sum of two independent single - band and one or more coupling terms .",
    "the coupling term is responsible for a single common transition temperature , usually different from the two single - band values , and similar effects on other properties .      in this section",
    ", i will discuss the separable model , which introduces anisotropy in a very simple way .",
    "most interestingly , it helps to clarify whether modifications caused by a second band can be distinguished from those by anisotropy .",
    "we will see that two - band and anisotropy effects can be described by an equivalent set of equations within this model , which indicates that discriminating the two models by the temperature dependence of various experimental results may be difficult in most cases .",
    "the separable model was originally introduced into bcs theory by markovitz and kadanoff @xcite , who defined the anisotropic pairing potential via @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the isotropic , i.e. averaged , value of the bcs coupling potential ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the momentum vectors of the electrons ( or quasiparticles ) before and after a scattering event , and @xmath25 specifies the anisotropy .",
    "we assume @xmath26 so that the fermi surface average of this function vanishes .",
    "the concept was later adapted for eliashberg theory @xcite by defining the anisotropic eliashberg spectral function - @xmath27 - in exactly the same way as the bcs potential , and hence the anisotropic electron - phonon interaction function is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 the fermi surface average of @xmath30 .",
    "setting @xmath31 yields the coupling strength @xmath32 .    dividing the fermi surface into two sheets , on which @xmath25 is constant , e.g.",
    "@xmath33 on sheet 1 and @xmath34 on sheet 2 , with @xmath35 due to equation ( [ eqn : sep : akfs ] ) , leads to the simplest form of the model .",
    "additionally , we can assume different electronic densities of states ( dos ) with relative weights @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) on each sheet , and hence @xmath38 where @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "the anisotropy is thus fully determined by a single parameter , namely @xmath41 .",
    "the anisotropic electron - phonon coupling function can be described by a series of so - called fermi surface harmonics @xcite . aborting this expansion after the first term",
    ", i.e. at zeroth order , leads to the separable model .",
    "accordingly , the separable model may not provide a correct quantitative description , except for very small anisotropies , but it is plausible to assume that the most significant features of the system are reliably described .",
    "some properties , as for example the upper critical field , additionally depend on the fermi velocity and its anisotropy , which is taken into account by @xmath42 where @xmath43 , the anisotropy function , is defined in the same way as @xmath25 , and @xmath44 is the average of the fermi velocity . to analyze different field orientations ,",
    "the average and the corresponding anisotropy should be taken from the relevant plane , e.g. that perpendicular to the applied field in case of calculating the upper critical field .",
    "again , it is most simple to assume @xmath43 to be constant on the two sheets , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and to be defined in the same way as @xmath47 in relation ( [ eqn : sep : ai ] ) by using a single anisotropy parameter @xmath48 ; but it should be noticed that the signs of @xmath47 and @xmath49 are opposite in most superconductors ( i.e. , a large fermi velocity implies a small coupling strength at the same part of the fermi surface and vice versa ) .",
    "now i come to the point that explains our interest in the separable model , namely its possible interpretation as a special case of the ( isotropic ) two - band model @xcite . in the simple two - band model , the fermi surface",
    "is divided into two spherical surfaces usually having different radii .",
    "each band is determined by an independent set of parameters , including a constant value of the coupling strength @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and of the fermi velocity @xmath52 ( @xmath51 )",
    ". additionally , interband coupling parameters @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) are to be defined .",
    "accordingly , the same set of parameters as in the separable model of the anisotropic single - band superconductor is used , and the same set of equations has to be solved . if the two - band quantities are fixed by the relations introduced for the anisotropic single - band model , namely equations ( [ eqn : sep : cs ] ) and ( [ eqn : sep : fv ] ) , both models will lead to the same results .",
    "note that the two - band model provides an additional parameter , the interband coupling strength , which is fixed in the single - band model by equation ( [ eqn : sep : cs ] ) but can be varied freely in the two - band model .",
    "nevertheless , the separable model was found to match experimental data not only of anisotropic single - band but also of two - band superconductors quite well @xcite .",
    "this was , for instance , demonstrated for the transition temperature and the thermodynamic critical field of the two - band superconductor mgb@xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "moreover , very good agreement was also achieved for the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat , including the reproduction of the specific heat jump at the transition temperature , which is much smaller than anticipated from bcs theory , and the unconventional low - temperature behavior with its shoulder at about 7k ( see figure [ sepmodel1 ] ) .",
    "using the second anisotropy parameter @xmath48 and fermi velocities from literature allowed calculating the upper critical fields for the two main crystallographic axes , resulting in the well known upward curvature for one of the field directions and the corresponding temperature dependence of the anisotropy in excellent agreement with experiment ( see figure [ sepmodel2 ] ) .",
    "the separable model is of particular use for analyzing some basic effects of anisotropy @xcite . in case of the two - band model",
    ", the anisotropy refers to the difference of the two constant values on the two spherical fermi bands , and in case of the single - band model , to the variation within one band . enhancing the anisotropy of the coupling function increases the transition temperature , for instance by a factor of roughly 2 in mgb@xmath0 @xcite . as for the specific heat ( cf .",
    "figure [ sepmodel1 ] ) , the jump at the transition temperature decreases when the anisotropy grows , whereas it increases when the mean coupling strength grows .",
    "a larger anisotropy weakens the coupling strength on parts of the fermi surface , which makes the electronic specific heat grow faster with temperature at low temperatures , while a stronger mean coupling , which results in larger energy gaps , makes it grow more slowly . a shoulder or kink at low temperatures , which reflects the weak coupling parts , emerges only for a rather high anisotropy",
    ". the situation may be somewhat different in the two - band model due to the possibility of varying the interband coupling strength independently , and hence the shoulder may emerge at a smaller or larger anisotropy . furthermore , anisotropy reduces the thermodynamic critical field and slightly changes its temperature dependence , which is nevertheless still close to the parabolic behavior .",
    "in contrast to the specific heat and the critical field , which are thermodynamic properties , the upper critical field ( cf .",
    "figure [ sepmodel2 ] ) depends on the field orientation via the fermi velocity anisotropy .",
    "both , the coupling and the velocity anisotropy enhance the upper critical field , but they affect its temperature dependence in a rather contrary way .",
    "the fermi velocity anisotropy perpendicular to the field is responsible for the upward curvature at high temperatures .",
    "this effect becomes more prominent and extends to lower temperatures as the velocity anisotropy grows but is moderated as the coupling function anisotropy grows .",
    "i conclude this section by discussing the effects of non - magnetic point impurities . in the anisotropic single - band model ,",
    "such impurities reduce the transition temperature and at the same time increase the slope of the upper critical field at the transition temperature ( which will enhance the upper critical field at low temperatures if the suppression of the transition temperature is not too large ) .",
    "for the two - band model , we may define different impurity scattering rates for intra- and interband scattering . in the isotropic two - band model ,",
    "intraband scattering increases the upper critical field slope but does not affect the transition temperature , as known from the anderson theorem ; only interband impurity scattering reduces the transition temperature .",
    "accordingly , the upper critical field should be modifiable almost independently from the transition temperature , which might explain the observation of quite different upper critical field values in mgb@xmath0 samples with equal transition temperature @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", though the separable model is a very simple model for the anisotropy , significant deviations from the isotropic ( bcs ) behavior can nicely be described , and the results often match the experimental data very well .",
    "this suggests that many of the unusual effects , found for instance in mgb@xmath0 , are rather general for strongly anisotropic superconductors , and do not heavily rely on the particular shape and properties of the fermi surface but rather on the mean values of the anisotropies . because the two - band and the anisotropic single - band model can be defined by the same set of parameters , anisotropy and two - band effects are expected to modify the temperature dependence of many superconducting properties in a similar way , making it difficult to distinguish between the models by experiment . as for the specific heat ,",
    "increasing the anisotropy of the coupling function reduces its jump at the transition temperature , leads to a faster grow at low temperatures , and eventually generates a shoulder - like behavior at low temperatures .",
    "the curvature of the upper critical field becomes positive at high temperatures as a consequence of fermi velocity anisotropy in this model .",
    "two - band superconductivity was first formulated within bcs theory @xcite using the following hamiltonian @xmath55 with @xmath56 here , @xmath57 denotes the renormalized normal - state energy with respect to the chemical potential of a single particle with momentum vector @xmath23 in band @xmath58 ( @xmath51 ) ; @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the corresponding creation and annihilation operators ; @xmath17 denotes the spin direction , which can be up ( @xmath61 ) or down ( @xmath62 ) , and @xmath63 the effective coupling potential of the bcs theory .",
    "definition ( [ eqn : bcs:3 ] ) , where @xmath64 = 1,2 or 2,1 and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the interband coupling potentials , introduces the interband effects .    applying the standard techniques from single - band bcs theory allows evaluating various properties of the two - band system , such as the density of states , presented in figure  [ fig : bcs ] , the temperature dependence of the energy gaps , and the transition temperature , which was shown to be higher than the values of each single - band @xcite .",
    "fitting two - band bcs theory to experimental specific heat data worked well for mgb@xmath0 @xcite , revealing that the jump at the transition temperature is smaller than in the single - band case .",
    "furthermore , the effects on the superfluid density and the magnetic penetration depth were reported to agree with the experimental data quite well .",
    "@xcite    aspects of anisotropy in single - band s - wave superconductors were construed in refs . @xcite and compared with experimental data on mgb@xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that the anisotropy of the gap function results in a two - peak structure in the energy dependence of the tunneling conductance , similarly as anticipated in a two - band system .",
    "also thermodynamic properties , such as the specific heat and the critical magnetic field , could be brought into reliable agreement with experimental data on mgb@xmath0 .",
    "consequently , the modifications due to anisotropy are again similar to those derived from two - band models .",
    "more complex situations including finite magnetic fields and non - spherical fermi surfaces can be studied by using the quasi - classical approximation of the green s function , i.e. by solving the corresponding eilenberger @xcite or - in case of strong disorder ( dirty limit ) - the usadel @xcite equations .",
    "the eilenberger equations are derived from gorkov s green s function approach to the bcs theory and simplify calculations at finite magnetic fields .",
    "several groups applied the approach to multi - band superconductivity .",
    "they showed that the thermodynamic properties @xcite were modified in a similar way as already mentioned for the previously discussed models .",
    "interband scattering by non - magnetic impurities was found to reduce the transition temperature much faster when the interband coupling strength is repulsive @xcite ( i.e. @xmath67 , implying that the gaps have opposite sign on the different sheets ; the @xmath68 scenario ) than in the ordinary case ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the energy gap and the electronic density of states near or at the fermi level can be calculated as a function of applied magnetic field and compared with experimental data from tunneling spectroscopy , which reveals the energy gap and the local density of states at a certain point of the sample surface , or with the sommerfeld coefficient ( @xmath70 ) , which is proportional to the volume average of the density of states and can be determined from specific heat measurements . assuming the volume averaged density of states to be proportional to the total volume of the normal - conducting vortex cores leads to a linear field dependence of the sommerfeld coefficient in an isotropic s - wave superconductor , which is however changed to a concave function in real materials due to the field dependence of the coherence length and the overlap of vortex cores at high magnetic fields @xcite . above the upper critical field , the sommerfeld coefficient matches the normal - conducting value which is usually constant .",
    "similarly , @xmath71 is expected for an isotropic d - wave material @xcite .",
    "two - band effects were mainly calculated for mgb@xmath0 by considering one isotropic band ( @xmath72 ) , having a small gap and a low upper critical field , and one anisotropic band ( @xmath17 ) , having a large gap and a high upper critical field @xcite .",
    "the slope of the sommerfeld coefficient was shown to be rather steep at low fields due to the dominating influence of the @xmath72-band , the contribution of which becomes saturated , i.e. constant , above its band upper critical field value , and thus to become flatter at higher fields when the @xmath17-band dominates , which is illustrated in figure  [ fig : bcs ] .",
    "interband coupling effects make the overall curve of the systems smoother , which may roughly ( but not very well ) be characterized by @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "the density of states of such a system would be rather isotropic at low fields ( when dominated by the isotropic @xmath72-band ) but strongly anisotropic at high fields ( due to the anisotropic @xmath17-band ) .",
    "it was further reported that even when the density of states of the smaller gap - band becomes saturated above a particular magnetic field the corresponding energy gap can be finite over the whole field range , i.e. both gaps close at the same field due to interband coupling @xcite . as for the energy dependence of the local density of states",
    ", it was indicated that the peak associated with the smaller gap may vanish at higher applied fields due to different band topologies @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained for the dirty limit by solving the usadel equations @xcite .",
    "it is again interesting to compare the two - band with anisotropic single - band results @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath75 in @xmath73 , which should be roughly one for isotropic superconductors , was shown to become smaller with increasing anisotropy .",
    "hence the anisotropy effects are again similar to the two - band effects .",
    "indeed , reliable agreement between the experimental data from the two - band superconductor nbse@xmath0 and calculated results from the anisotropic single - band model was demonstrated .",
    "additional minor modifications are expected from impurity scattering @xcite .    in summary",
    ", the quasi - classical approximation makes calculations at finite magnetic fields possible .",
    "the field dependence of the sommerfeld coefficient should be close to linear , though slightly curved , in case of isotropic s - wave and close to a square root behavior in case of d - wave symmetry .",
    "for a two - band superconductor in which one band is suppressed at relatively low magnetic fields , we expect a steep gradient at low and a flatter course at high fields and the kink , indicating the upper critical field of the weaker band , to be smeared out by interband coupling .",
    "a similar behavior is expected in anisotropic single - band superconductors , where the isotropic linear dependence was demonstrated to become more concave with increasing anisotropy . concerning the energy gaps ,",
    "both should close at the same ( upper critical ) field even when the band upper critical fields are different .",
    "the gap structure of the density of states near the fermi energy may change considerably with magnetic field .      in the final subsection",
    ", i will summarize results from the migdal eliashberg theory , which takes strong coupling effects into account .",
    "even if the mean coupling strength of a two - band superconductor is weak , one of the bands could be in the strong coupling regime , making strong coupling effects relevant .",
    "some publications , which will be reviewed below , have provided deep insight into the influence of the anisotropy , the interband coupling strengths , and the impurity scattering rates , etc . on the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of two - band materials .",
    "results from the eliashberg equations have often been found to agree with experimental data better than those from other models and to describe the superconducting properties of many conventional ( i.e. electron - phonon mediated ) superconductors even quantitatively precisely @xcite . basically , the green s function of the system has to be calculated by taking into account the self - energies related to the electron - phonon interaction , which is characterized by the eliashberg spectral function @xmath76 , the electron - electron coulomb interaction , characterized by the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath77 , and the electron - impurity interaction , usually in first born s approximation , specified by the mean scattering time @xcite .",
    "the model allows us to determine all thermodynamic properties that can be derived from the free energy , and other properties , such as the transition temperature , the energy gap , the density of states , etc .",
    "except for the upper critical fields , which additionally depend on the fermi velocity @xmath78 , magnetic field effects are usually inaccessible .",
    "two - band effects are naturally included when we solve the complete anisotropic form of the equations .",
    "to do so , the local values of the input parameters , at least of @xmath79 , which can be determined from @xmath76 , have to be known on the whole fermi surface . to avoid that , the fermi surface topology is often simplified .",
    "as already mentioned , the fermi surface anisotropy may be approximated by the separable model or by the corresponding two - band model with two spherical bands , specified by two densities of states , four ( frequency dependent ) coupling functions , four pseudopotentials , and the impurity scattering rates .",
    "moreover , cylindrically , elliptically , and similarly shaped fermi bands have been used .",
    "choi et al . @xcite solved the fully anisotropic eliashberg equations for the two - band superconducting material mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and phonon energy @xmath80 dependence of @xmath27 was acquired from ab - initio methods , while the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath81 , supposed to have only minor influence on the superconducting properties and hence taken isotropic , was chosen by adjusting the results to the correct value of the transition temperature . using these parameters",
    ", they were able to calculate the energy gap distribution , the specific heat behavior , and the isotope effect in excellent quantitative agreement with experiment .",
    "it was concluded that the anisotropy and the two - band nature are responsible for the rather high transition temperature ( which was approximately twice the value of the corresponding isotropic system ) and that the low energy excitations , which come along with the smaller values within the wide range of the energy gap distribution , lead to the low - temperature shoulder of the specific heat .",
    "several other groups investigated two - band properties - mainly of mgb@xmath0 - by eliashberg theory but applied simpler models , such as mentioned above , for the anisotropy .",
    "nevertheless , they were able to obtain similarly good agreement with experimental data as with the fully anisotropic theory .",
    "this again indicates that prominent two - band effects such as the low - temperature anomaly in the specific heat do not depend on details of the eliashberg spectral function @xcite but are common for anisotropic or two - band superconductors that have a wide distribution of energy gap values .",
    "for instance , taking the same mean value of the coupling strength ( @xmath82 ) and the peak of the eliashberg spectral function , simplified by an einstein - like spectrum , at the same position as in the fully anisotropic model of choi et al .",
    "@xcite allowed reproducing various experimental results on mgb@xmath0 by the separable model of the eliashberg equations very well @xcite .",
    "diverse other effects of a second band have been investigated .",
    "for instance , the superfluid density ( which is proportional to @xmath83 , with @xmath84 the magnetic penetration depth for current flow in @xmath85 direction ) of an isotropic s - wave superconductor is almost constant at low temperatures , but starts to decrease rapidly above a certain temperature .",
    "similarly as for the specific heat , low energy excitations , associated with the smaller gap values , reduce the threshold temperature and may significantly change the overall behavior from a concave towards a more linear or even convex behavior over a large temperature range @xcite , see figure  [ fig : eliasha ] . in case of small interband effects , a kink indicating the weaker band",
    "may be observed at low temperatures .",
    "strong impurity scattering in one band , particularly if the smaller - gap - band is in the dirty limit , can almost recover the conventional bcs behavior @xcite",
    ".    calculations of the upper critical field reproduced the upward curvature found in many experiments . applying the separable model @xcite showed that the temperature at which the curvature of the upper critical field switches from negative to positive shifts to lower values when we increase the anisotropy of the fermi velocity perpendicular to the applied field but to higher values when we increase the anisotropy of the coupling function . a two - band eliashberg model based on mgb@xmath0 with one spherical weak coupling ( @xmath72 ) and one elliptical stronger coupling ( @xmath17 ) band was studied in @xcite .",
    "the kink indicating the upper critical field of the @xmath72-band in the absence of interband interaction was demonstrated to be smeared out by quite small interband coupling parameters .",
    "the upward curvature of the upper critical field near the transition temperature was predicted to become more pronounced when the anisotropy of the fermi velocities ( here , the ratio of the values of the two bands ) or the off - diagonal ( interband ) couplings increase ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : eliashb ] ) .",
    "similar effects were calculated for intraband impurity scattering .",
    "for instance , it was reported that @xmath86 may show an upward curvature in mgb@xmath0 even for @xmath87 , for which the relevant fermi velocities are quite similar and thus the upward curvature is usually not observed , if the @xmath17-band is pushed into the dirty limit and the @xmath72-band remains clean .",
    "all these effects usually render the upper critical field anisotropy temperature dependent .",
    "further systematic investigations on diverse properties such as the energy gaps , the specific heat , the superfluid density , and the thermodynamic critical field deviation function , which measures how strongly the thermodynamic critical field deviates from a parabolic temperature behavior , were reported in @xcite . using parameters roughly based on the properties known for mgb@xmath0",
    ", the authors showed that not only anisotropy but also strong coupling could have a significant influence , so that bcs and eliashberg results may diverge significantly in some cases .",
    "furthermore , anisotropy and strong coupling were reported to lead to opposite corrections in most cases ; for instance , strong coupling increases the specific heat jump at the transition temperature , whereas anisotropy associated with the ratio of the intraband coupling strengths , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , decreases it ; stronger interband coupling , however , increases the jump again .",
    "moreover , studying the influence of the interband coupling strength and of the interband impurity scattering rate revealed that even a weak interband interaction significantly washes out the transition of the smaller gap band .",
    "effects of interband impurity scattering are often similar to that of interband coupling . concerning the specific heat jump , a small impurity scattering rate may reduce the value when the transition temperature decreases strongly , but a high intraband impurity scattering rate should always raise the jump - height ( cf . also @xcite for further impurity effects ) .",
    "finally , interband coupling can induce superconductivity in a band with repulsive intraband coupling .    in conclusion ,",
    "the eliashberg equations give access to strong coupling effects and result in a quantitatively correct description of superconducting properties in many cases .",
    "though any anisotropy can be implemented , simple fermi surfaces with spherical or elliptical shapes have proved successful in describing diverse two - band effects .",
    "for instance , the superfluid density was found to drop faster at low temperatures and to change from a concave to a more linear or even convex temperature dependence with increasing intraband coupling anisotropy .",
    "the effects on the specific heat and the upper critical field correspond to those reported in the separable model section ( [ sec : sepmodel ] ) .",
    "in addition , stronger interband coupling enhances the specific heat jump and the kink representing the transition of the weaker band in the temperature dependence of diverse properties is washed out .",
    "quite similar effects were predicted for interband impurity scattering .",
    "the following section is considered the main part of this review .",
    "i will list and discuss several experimental techniques that have commonly been used for identifying two - band materials and will show the results .",
    "the selection of the methods is rather arbitrary , and omitted methods are not meant to be less important . except for the thermal conductivity and the energy gaps ,",
    "i concentrate on thermal and mixed - state properties that are somehow linked to the reversible magnetic properties of the superconductor , namely the specific heat and the corresponding sommerfeld coefficient , the superfluid density , the upper critical fields , the torque , the reversible magnetization , the anisotropy , and the field dependence of the characteristic lengths . for each subsection",
    ", i will give a brief introduction on the property and then review some results obtained on different samples , including not only two - band materials .",
    "measurements of the specific heat in mgb@xmath0 have uncovered striking deviations from the so - called standard curve ( i.e. that obtained from bcs theory ) , which were soon attributed to two - band superconductivity .",
    "those remarkable features are the jump - height at the transition , the unconventional low - temperature behavior and a kink or shoulder in between .",
    "later , similar effects have been found in other materials .",
    "the difference in the specific heat of the normal - conducting and the superconducting state follows from the difference in the free energy density @xmath90 via @xmath91 .",
    "the normal - conducting part @xmath92 includes the electron @xmath93 and the phonon @xmath94 contribution , from which the linear electron part , @xmath95 with the sommerfeld constant @xmath96 dominates at low temperatures . in equation  ( [ eqn : specheat:2 ] ) , @xmath97 denotes the boltzmann constant , @xmath98 the total electronic density of states at the fermi energy , and @xmath82 the coupling strength .",
    "the phonon contribution is normally modeled by @xmath99 , with field independent constants @xmath100 and @xmath101 , or just by @xmath102 , taken from the low - temperature limit of debye s theory , and is assumed to be equal in the normal- and superconducting state ; @xmath103 is thus the difference in the electronic parts . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the schottky anomaly may become noticeable .",
    "an easily accessible characteristic value of a superconducting material is the jump of @xmath103 at the transition temperature normalized by its normal - conducting value @xmath104 , i.e. @xmath105 weak coupling bcs theory results in a material - independent universal value of @xmath106 , which was indeed measured in aluminum , a material meeting the bcs preconditions fairly well due to its weak coupling strength ( @xmath107 in al ) and a near spherical fermi surface .",
    "both , experiment and ( eliashberg ) theory @xcite demonstrated that this value should grow with the coupling strength - for instance to about 2.8 in lead ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "although the coupling strength of mgb@xmath0 is approximately 0.6 , the jump - magnitude was found to be much smaller than the weak coupling threshold , namely , as illustrated in figure  [ sepmodel1 ] , at about @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "similar results have been reported for some other materials .",
    "theory was shown to predict that a second band should reduce that value as the disparity of the ( two ) intraband coupling strengths increases ; the same should happen when the anisotropy of a single - band material increases @xcite .    at very low temperatures ,",
    "bcs theory predicts @xmath110 for the electronic specific heat of a superconductor @xcite , with @xmath111 a temperature independent constant .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : specheat:4 ] ) is governed by the exponential function at low temperatures , which reflects the probability of destroying a cooper - pair by the thermal energy @xmath112 .",
    "accordingly , with increasing temperature the specific heat remains almost constant up to a threshold - temperature , and then starts to grow rather quickly .",
    "the threshold value lies at about @xmath113 in the bcs scenario , set by the ratio @xmath114 which is equal to 1.77 .",
    "as that ratio becomes smaller , @xmath115 grows faster at low temperatures . in case of different gap values ,",
    "the threshold - temperature is determined by the smaller gaps , and we thus expect similar low - temperature modifications for the anisotropic and the two - band scenario .",
    "the above is only valid for ( fully gapped ) s - wave superconductors , while in d - wave systems the gap nodes allow a significant occupation of the excitation spectrum at any finite temperature , which makes @xmath115 increase strongly even at very low temperatures .",
    "more precisely , a quadratic ( at zero magnetic field ) or linear temperature dependence was predicted and confirmed by experiment @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the low - temperature behavior of the specific heat of two - band superconductors is dominated by the band with the smaller gap , while the high - temperature behavior rather by that with the larger gap ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] ) . in between",
    ", a crossover takes place which is smoothed by interband coupling and impurity scattering ; nevertheless , a kink , a shoulder , or even a small peak may still be present , as for instance observed in mgb@xmath0 at about 7 - 8k .",
    "it is obvious that describing the total temperature dependence of those unconventional specific heat curves by conventional bcs theory would fail .",
    "a common approach to fitting the specific heat and other thermodynamic properties of superconductors is provided by the so - called @xmath75-model @xcite , in which the temperature dependence of the energy gap , @xmath116 , follows bcs theory , but the absolute value at @xmath117k , i.e. @xmath118 ( or the ratio @xmath119 ) , is adjusted to fit experiment .",
    "we can often nicely describe two - band properties as the sum of two @xmath75-model curves by adjusting the parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 as well as the corresponding relative weights of the bands .",
    "although that model is not at all a true two - band model , for interband interactions are ignored , it has been successfully used for describing the specific heat in a lot of samples like that shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] . moreover , using parameters of mgb@xmath0 , dolgov et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the energy gaps resulting from this procedure were fairly close to the gaps obtained by eliashberg calculations .",
    "other results , as for instance the density of states ratio of the two bands , deviated more considerably from the eliashberg results . in conclusion",
    ", the @xmath75-model seems to be useful for roughly estimating the gap values of a two - band superconductor @xcite but may fail in proving a material to be a two - band superconductor or not .",
    "as already mentioned , mgb@xmath0 single crystals display all three characteristic features of a two - band ( or strongly anisotropic single - band ) specific heat curve , namely a rather fast increase at low temperatures , a small jump at the transition temperature , and a shoulder in between @xcite .",
    "the effect of disorder on mgb@xmath0 was studied by putti et al . @xcite .",
    "as the amount of impurities introduced by neutron irradiation increased , the shoulder at intermediate temperatures was observed to fade away and the low - temperature specific heat grew more slowly , only the jump at the transition temperature was hardly affected .",
    "eventually , the heavily irradiated samples even matched the single - band @xmath75-model .",
    "these results confirm the theoretical prediction that impurity scattering masks two - band effects .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat in the ternary - iron silicide lu@xmath0fe@xmath122si@xmath123 @xcite was reported to be quite similar to that of mgb@xmath0 ( see figure  [ fig : spec ] for lu@xmath0fe@xmath122si@xmath123 and compare with figure  [ sepmodel1 ] for mgb@xmath0 ) .",
    "the measurements showed a specific heat jump of roughly 1.05 at the transition temperature , a very pronounced shoulder at about 0.2 @xmath19 , and a fast , though still exponential rise of the curve at low temperatures .",
    "interband coupling and impurity scattering are supposed to suppress the shoulder at intermediate temperatures , and the absence of this anomaly does therefore not refute the two - band hypothesis .",
    "for instance , results on the two - band superconductor nbse@xmath0 reported in @xcite did not display a shoulder and , moreover , revealed a higher jump @xmath124 than in bcs theory .",
    "nevertheless , both the anisotropic gap and the two - band model agreed well with the specific heat data .",
    "similar results were reported for nbs@xmath0 @xcite , though only the two - band fits revealed gap values in agreement with scanning tunneling data , while the single - band fits did not .",
    "the majority of the specific heat measurements on the new iron - based superconductors has been aimed at unraveling the properties of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "curves of slightly overdoped ba(fe@xmath125co@xmath126)@xmath0as@xmath0 ( ba122 ) were reported to grow exponentially at low temperature @xcite , indicating fully gapped bands , and to be nicely described by the two - band @xmath75-model with different gaps , although the jump at the transition was found to be close to bcs theory and no significant shoulder was observed .",
    "a residual normal - state - like specific heat at 0k was considered a possible indication of @xmath127 symmetry , i.e. of opposite phases in the order parameters of the two bands .",
    "working on the same kind of materials , gofryk et al .",
    "@xcite claimed that their optimally - doped samples could be well described by fully - gapped two - band models , while their over- and underdoped ba122 samples should have nodes due to a power - law - like rise of the specific heat at low temperatures ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "the situation ought to be similarly complex in other iron - based materials .",
    "for instance , the specific heat of fese @xcite nicely matched d - wave and diverse s - wave models .",
    "only the low - temperature data showed that the two - band behavior with one isotropic and one extended s - wave order parameter agreed slightly better than the other expressions .",
    "however , it is not clear to which extent the @xmath75-model is capable of covering the specifics of the different models in view of ignoring interband effects .",
    "two - band models were also adjusted to data of lifeas @xcite , mainly to decide whether the gap has nodes on one of the bands or not .",
    "huang et al.@xcite analyzed the specific heat of an yni@xmath0b@xmath0c single crystal .",
    "they reported best agreement for the two - band @xmath75-model but still reliable matching with other models based on order parameters with nodes .    in conclusion ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat of suspected two - band superconductors often fits two - band and anisotropic single - band models equally well . in some cases",
    ", it is even difficult to distinguish between s - wave ( when the gaps are very small on parts of the fermi surface ) and d - wave symmetry . in those problematic cases ,",
    "a high number of low - temperature data may allow us to distinguish the fit - quality of the different models , but the usefulness of the simplified models might be questionable , because interband interaction is usually ignored .",
    "it may be considered a support for the two - band scenario when the evaluated energy gaps match those determined by other methods such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "the volume - averaged quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) at the fermi surface of a superconductor grows with magnetic field and can be acquired from the linear part of the specific heat at very low temperatures via the sommerfeld constant or coefficient ( @xmath70 ) , as defined in equation ( [ eqn : specheat:2 ] ) .",
    "the field dependence of the sommerfeld coefficient , @xmath128 , crucially depends on the fermi surface and might help to distinguish different scenarios .    as the magnetic field increases , the number of vortices and the corresponding total volume of the normal - conducting vortex - cores of the mixed - state grow and",
    "hence enhance the quasiparticle density of states .",
    "we expect the density of states of a standard s - wave single - band superconductor to be proportional to the number of vortices and thus to grow linearly with field . in two - band s - wave materials ,",
    "the rise of the density of states should be linear at low fields but should become flatter at high fields , when superconductivity is suppressed and the density of states thus saturated in one of the bands . in other words ,",
    "two linear parts are anticipated , from which the low - field region should be steeper . the cross - over indicates the upper critical field of the first band , while the saturation of @xmath128 at high fields marks the overall upper critical field .",
    "finally , d - wave superconductors were predicted to show a @xmath129 behavior @xcite , and thus the different models should be easily distinguishable .    as usual , reality is not that simple , because the field dependence of @xmath130 is influenced by further effects , such as the overlap of vortex cores , which becomes more prominent with smaller vortex - vortex distances , and the shrinkage of the vortex core size with increasing field @xcite .",
    "these effects tend to reduce the slope of @xmath128 , as confirmed by experiments on the rather isotropic conventional superconductor nb @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : sommerfeld ] , and by calculations already mentioned in section [ sec : bcs ] , that showed the linear dependence to change to a roughly @xmath131 behavior , with @xmath74 ; an even stronger curvature was predicted for anisotropic materials . as the two - band curves are influenced by the same effects and additionally by interband interactions , it becomes again difficult to distinguish anisotropic single - band from two - band or both from d - wave behavior , which is illustrated in figure  [ fig : sommerfeld ] .",
    "the sommerfeld coefficient is usually acquired from the low - temperature behavior of the specific heat in magnetic fields . ignoring the superconducting electronic part at those low temperatures",
    ", we can acquire the sommerfeld coefficient by extrapolating the same expression as used for the normal - conducting region in the previous subsection to 0k . in some cases ,",
    "the superconducting electronic part was taken into account by an exponential part corresponding to equation ( [ eqn : specheat:4 ] ) .",
    "several groups have determined @xmath132 of mgb@xmath0 @xcite . in @xcite @xmath133 was found .",
    "having evaluated a lot of data points , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite observed two rather linear regions separated by a significant drop of the slope at about 0.5 t , i.e. close to the lower upper critical field ( cf .",

    "both , the anisotropic single - band and the two - band model were found to match @xmath132 reasonably well . in the case of nbse@xmath0",
    ", the two - band fits to @xmath132 and to the specific heat resulted in similar values for the gaps and the relative density of states , while the anisotropic single - band fits did not , which might indicate that the single - band hypothesis is not appropriate for this material .",
    "moreover , the experimental data indicated a possible kink in @xmath132 , which would only be covered by the two - band scenario . for nbs@xmath0 @xcite ,",
    "a very high density of data points revealed a slight inconsistency with the anisotropic single - band fit at low fields , while the two - band model matched better .",

    "@xcite discovered concave curves close to the typical d - wave behavior for under- and overdoped samples but an almost linear behavior , as anticipated for isotropic s - wave materials , for the optimally doped sample .",
    "the exact classification of the dependence , however , suffered from uncertainties in the upper critical fields , for these values are very high and normally not directly measurable .",
    "data on the iron - based fese samples @xcite revealed a rather strong increase of the sommerfeld coefficient at very low fields and a much flatter , almost linear behavior at higher fields , hence indicating the two - band s - wave scenario .    in yni@xmath0b@xmath0c , @xmath134 , which is actually close to the d - wave prediction , was reported @xcite and claimed to agree with a two - band model ( as was found for the temperature dependence of the specific heat in this case ) .",
    "a field dependence of @xmath135 was confirmed for several cuprate superconductors ( figure  [ fig : sommerfeld ] ) @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the field dependence of the sommerfeld coefficient can not clearly discriminate two - band from anisotropic single - band behavior . in some cases ,",
    "the experimental data seem to reveal a kink in @xmath132 at a field much lower than the overall upper critical field , which would not be easy to explain within the single - band theory .",
    "further indications may be gained from comparing the gaps and relative weights obtained from fits to @xmath132 with results from analyzing other properties , such as the specific heat .",
    "thermal conductivity is governed by several mechanisms in a superconductor , which makes its interpretation often difficult .",
    "nevertheless , at low temperatures its field dependence might be useful for identifying two - band superconductivity , as was demonstrated for mgb@xmath0 .",
    "a temperature gradient in a material gives rise to heat flow , which is characterized by the thermal conductivity coefficient @xmath136 .",
    "in most cases , electrons ( @xmath137 ) and phonons ( @xmath138 ) contribute to the heat transport and thus @xmath139 the equilibrium distribution is reached by scattering processes , such as electrons by impurities and phonons ( @xmath140 = @xmath141 + @xmath142 ) and phonons by impurities and electrons ( @xmath143 = @xmath144 + @xmath145 ) .",
    "each of these processes leads to different temperature dependencies , as for instance @xmath146 and @xmath147 at low temperatures , which may result in different and complicated conductivity curves . at very low temperatures , impurity or defect scattering often prevails . in normal - conducting metals",
    "the low - temperature thermal flow is usually dominated by electrons , though the situation may change in the superconducting state .    the quasiparticle number and consequently , as cooper - pairs do not contribute to the thermal flow , the electronic part of the thermal conductivity are reduced upon cooling in a superconductor . on the other hand ,",
    "the smaller number of electrons reduces the number of scattering events by phonons and thus increases the corresponding phonon part @xmath148 .",
    "we see that superconductivity changes not only the electron but also the phonon contribution , which makes interpreting the thermal conductivity often more difficult than for instance the specific heat .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the thermal conductivity may vary considerably from material to material . at low temperatures and as the magnetic field increases",
    ", we anticipate a drop of the conductivity immediately above the lower critical field , which is eventually superseded by an increase at higher fields and a constant behavior above the upper critical field .",
    "the drop follows from vortex formation above the lower critical field and the corresponding proliferation of phonon scattering events at the vortex core quasiparticles .",
    "the subsequent rise is carried by the delocalization of more and more vortex core quasiparticles , while quasiparticles bound in a vortex core do not participate in the thermal transport .",
    "the low - temperature thermal conductivity of a conventional s - wave material in the clean limit , such as nb @xcite , is expected to increase roughly exponentially with field , i.e. it should slowly increase at low fields but rapidly just below the upper critical field , as a consequence of heavy vortex core overlapping , which is illustrated in figure  [ fig : thermh ] .",
    "increasing the impurity density should produce a larger slope at intermediate fields @xcite . in case of anisotropy , a steeper increase at low field , followed by a flatter part at intermediate fields , and again a steep slope below the upper critical field",
    "was reported @xcite .",
    "this is basically similar to two - band effects .",
    "if the gap has nodes , a significant amount of quasiparticles will be delocalized even at low temperatures , which will render the thermal conductivity more linear or even concave over the whole field range ( e.g. @xcite and figure  [ fig : thermh ] ) .",
    "the curves often become more complicated at higher temperatures .",
    "let us discuss the thermal conductivity of mgb@xmath0 @xcite . at low temperatures",
    "the curve was observed to drop rapidly at low fields and then to increase .",
    "this increasing part , shown in figure  [ fig : thermh ] , was found to be independent of the field orientation below about 0.5 t and hence supposed to reflect the isotropic @xmath72-band with an upper critical field of roughly 0.5 t . at higher fields the conductivity became flatter at first and then again steep near the upper critical field and almost constant in the normal - conducting state .",
    "the second part , i.e. that above 0.5 t , was found to be strongly anisotropic and hence assumed to reflect the conductivity of the anisotropic @xmath17-band .",
    "thermal conductivity was measured in other materials such as nbse@xmath0 , fese , lu@xmath0fe@xmath122si@xmath123 , etc . @xcite and similarities to the behavior of mgb@xmath0",
    "were considered to support the two - band scenario .    in conclusion ,",
    "the effects of two - band superconductivity on the field dependence of the thermal conductivity appear significant if the bands have different upper critical fields .",
    "the expected curve is characterized by two steep slopes just below each of the upper critical fields and a flatter slope in between .",
    "note , however , that a similar result was calculated for anisotropic single - band superconductors @xcite . finally , it should be borne in mind that the behavior may significantly depend on the dominating scattering process , and that less theoretical analysis than for some other properties , presented in this paper , is available .",
    "the temperature dependencies of the superfluid density and the magnetic penetration depth are well known for standard s - wave and d - wave superconductors . in some materials , such as mgb@xmath0 , significant deviations from this standard behavior , as for instance a faster drop of the superfluid density at low temperatures , were observed , which could be interpreted in terms of a two - band but in many cases , also of an anisotropic single - band model .",
    "the london penetration depth is defined by @xmath149 with @xmath150 the mass , @xmath151 the density , and @xmath152 the charge of the superconducting charge carriers .",
    "it shows up in the second london equation via @xmath153 = @xmath154 and via @xmath155 = @xmath156 , and thus determines the penetration of the magnetic induction ( @xmath6 ) and of the electrical current density ( @xmath157 ) at the surface of a superconductor in the meissner state .",
    "the london equation refers to the local limit and is hence valid when the penetration depth is much larger than the coherence length .",
    "corresponding relations are acquired from ginzburg landau and bcs theory at low magnetic inductions .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath158 i.e. the temperature dependencies of the magnetic penetration depth and of the cooper - pair density are closely related . at low temperatures",
    "bcs predicts an exponential behavior @xcite , similarly as for the specific heat @xmath159 with @xmath160 a temperature independent constant .",
    "reflecting the loss of superconducting particles by thermal excitations , the curve decreases continuously and reaches zero at the transition temperature .",
    "the weak - coupling bcs behavior is universal for all materials ( see dashed curve in figure  [ sfldensity ] ) . at low temperatures",
    "the superfluid density of fully - gapped materials is governed by the exponential function and thus almost constant ( and equal to 1 ) up to a particular temperature determined by @xmath161 .",
    "strengthening the coupling usually enhances the energy gap and hence enlarges the range over which the superfluid density is nearly constant , while a smaller gap reduces this range and makes the superfluid density decrease with temperature more rapidly at low temperatures ( see lines in figure  [ sfldensity ] , where the gap of the @xmath162 curve is smaller and that of the @xmath163 larger than the bcs value ) .",
    "when the energy gap values diverge in a material , the lower values govern the low - temperature behavior , which is why the superfluid density drops faster than predicted by bcs theory , while the larger gaps govern the high - temperature behavior .",
    "if parts of the gap function are very small , the s - wave superconductor could even resemble the d - wave behavior , for which we expect the superfluid density to decline linearly at low temperatures .    without interband interactions",
    "the superfluid density is just the sum of the contributions from the two bands , with the smaller gap - band dominating the low and the larger gap - band the high temperature region .",
    "the crossover at intermediate temperature is marked by a kink .",
    "as interband coupling and impurity scattering are turned on and then increased , the kink is smoothed and then fades away , so that the overall curve is shifted towards a linear and then towards a concave shape @xcite , as schematically presented in figure  [ fig : eliasha ] .",
    "like the specific heat , the superfluid density of two - band materials has been fitted using the @xmath75-model @xcite ( see figure  [ sfldensity ] ) .",
    "a more elaborate fit model including interband coupling was recently introduced by kogan et al .",
    "note that a superconducting foreign phase with a different transition temperature may also produce a kink or a similar anomaly in the temperature dependence .",
    "the superfluid density has been found to be almost linear or even convex in mgb@xmath0 @xcite ( figure  [ sfldensity ] ) , nbse@xmath0 @xcite and other materials .",
    "khasanov et al .",
    "@xcite observed a very significant change in the slope of @xmath164 , measured by muon - spin rotation , in some cuprates ( e.g. yba@xmath0cu@xmath122o@xmath165 ) at low temperatures , which is shown in figure  [ sfldensity ] and was considered a confirmation of a second band having s - wave symmetry in contrast to the established d - wave band .",
    "the s - wave band contribution was found to be significant at low fields and to vanish smoothly with increasing applied field , indicating a rather low upper critical field of this band .",
    "a lot of experimental data is available for iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "though varying from material to material and depending on doping , the superfluid density seems to resemble the known two - band trends , i.e. it decreases rapidly at low temperatures and becomes almost linear or even convex at elevated temperatures , so that a conventional bcs fit does not match but a two - band one does .",
    "different energy gap values , from which the smaller ones dominate the low- and the larger ones the high - temperature behavior , are also found in an anisotropic single - band superconductor .",
    "accordingly , the resulting curve could easily resemble two - band behavior .",
    "though it seems difficult to imitate the extreme two - band case , in which the contributions of the two gaps can still be distinguished ( i.e. when interband effects are very weak ) , most experimentally observed curves showing almost linear or slightly convex behavior over large parts of the temperature range fit the anisotropic single - band model well as was , for instance , demonstrated for mgb@xmath0 @xcite .    in conclusion , in case of different energy gap values at the fermi surface , the low - temperature superfluid density behavior is governed by the smaller gaps and the high temperature one by the larger gaps .",
    "accordingly , the superfluid density of both anisotropic and two - band s - wave materials , having a small and a large gap , drops more rapidly than expected from bcs theory at low temperatures and may become more linear or even convex at elevated temperatures .",
    "consequently , distinguishing anisotropy from two - band effects is again difficult .",
    "the upper critical field ( @xmath2 ) was one of the first properties of mgb@xmath0 , for which unconventional behavior was discerned , namely by a pronounced upward ( positive ) curvature of its temperature dependence near the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "since then , the effect has been discovered in many materials and often considered as a confirmation of two - band superconductivity .",
    "we shall point out , however , that the same effect occurs in anisotropic single - band and even in d - wave superconductors .",
    "the upper critical field can be easily determined in most superconductors , for it marks the continuous phase transition from the super- to the normal - conducting state , observable , for instance , by a jump in the electric resistivity or the specific heat , or by a kink in the reversible magnetization .",
    "calculating the upper critical field within eliashberg theory allows taking into account different coupling strengths , impurity scattering rates , order parameter symmetries , and arbitrary fermi surfaces , including multi - bands .",
    "the weak coupling bcs limit leads to the well - known whh ( werthamer , helfand , and hohenberg @xcite ) behavior , predicting that the slope of @xmath166 is constant near the transition temperature and becomes gradually less negative upon cooling .",

    "whh found @xmath169 , which has been well confirmed not only for almost isotropic conventional superconductors but also for many strongly anisotropic or two - band materials along their uniaxial crystallographic axis ( if available ) . for instance , @xmath170 equal to 0.75 was reported for mgb@xmath0 in fields perpendicular to the boron planes @xcite .",
    "those results are confirmed by eliashberg theory , which shows @xmath170 to grow only slightly with coupling strength @xcite , e.g. to about 0.76 for @xmath171 ( which corresponds to lead ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath172 , acquired in the dirty limit of the weak coupling case , suggests that impurity scattering effects are small .",
    "early measurements of the upper critical field in mgb@xmath0 unveiled a remarkable deviation from the whh behavior , namely a pronounced upward curvature near the transition temperature in fields parallel to the boron planes ( @xmath173 - direction ) but a conventional behavior along @xmath101 ( the uniaxial axis ) , making the anisotropy @xmath174 decrease with temperature @xcite , as shown in figure  [ sepmodel2 ] .",
    "these peculiarities have also been reported for other materials , such as nb @xcite , v @xcite , nbse@xmath0 @xcite ( figure  [ fig : bc2 ] ) , borocarbides and -nitrides @xcite , heavy fermion systems @xcite , iron - based @xcite ( figure  [ fig : bc2 ] ) , and cuprate @xcite superconductors , and have often been considered as an indication or a confirmation of two - band superconductivity . the effect may change from sample to sample and is sometimes quite small .    the upward curvature of the upper critical field of two - band superconductors has also been confirmed by theory .",
    "within eliashberg theory , this curvature was shown to appear when the fermi velocities of the two bands are different and to become more pronounced when the ratio of the velocities increases @xcite .",
    "this would explain why the feature is observed for @xmath175 but not for @xmath87 in mgb@xmath0 , for the mean fermi velocities perpendicular to the applied field are quite different in case of @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) but similar for @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , two - band superconductors do not necessarily display this feature for any field direction .",
    "the curvature is affected by the coupling and the impurity scattering parameters in different manners .",
    "for instance , it was claimed that different intraband scattering rates could produce the upward curvature even if the fermi velocities are similar @xcite .",
    "a small positive @xmath177 curvature for the field along the uniaxial axis was indeed found after heavy neutron irradiation in an mgb@xmath0 single crystal @xcite , but ascribed to inhomogeneities in the transition temperature caused by the defect distribution .    in samples with uniaxial symmetry",
    ", the positive curvature usually occurs for measurements in fields perpendicular to this axis , which is mostly also the direction of the maximal upper critical field values .",
    "a different behavior , namely an upward curvature for a field orientation not showing the highest upper critical field values , was observed in some iron - based superconductors , as for instance in the 1111 and 122 compounds ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : mat : fe ] ) @xcite .",
    "also in contrast to mgb@xmath0 , the corresponding anisotropy was found to increase with temperature , which might be an effect of pauli paramagnetic pair breaking , occurring at low temperatures in high magnetic fields and flattening the upper critical field behavior ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : bc2 ] ) .    it should not be missed that an upward curvature of the upper critical field and hence a temperature dependent anisotropy have been known for anisotropic s - wave superconductors for a long time . the theory based on the eliashberg model",
    "was elaborated in refs .",
    "the effect was even observed in niobium and shown to match theory well @xcite .",
    "similar results have been reported for other materials . in many cases , the simple separable model , introduced in section [ sec : sepmodel ] ,",
    "was found to fit the experiments quite well . because this model formally agrees with a spherical two - band model ,",
    "similar effects by both scenarios are anticipated .",
    "indeed , the anisotropic single - band theory was shown to reproduce the upper critical field of mgb@xmath0 @xcite ( see figure [ sepmodel2 ] ) and other potential two - band materials @xcite nicely .",
    "the upward curvature of @xmath177 in single - band superconductors was also derived from the eilenberger equations @xcite . in principle",
    ", theory shows the upper critical field to be governed by an integral over the fermi surface which includes the fermi velocities perpendicular to the field orientation .",
    "thus , details of the anisotropy do not show up in the upper critical field and hence quite different fermi surfaces with a similar mean anisotropy may lead to a similar @xmath177 behavior .",
    "the upward curvature was also predicted for d - wave symmetry @xcite , which was recently confirmed by measurements of a temperature dependent anisotropy in smba@xmath0cu@xmath122o@xmath126 @xcite and yba@xmath0cu@xmath122o@xmath178 @xcite .",
    "differences between the single and the two - band model might become visible when introducing impurities . in the single - band scenario , scattering by non - magnetic point defects smears out the anisotropy of the fermi surface and thus reduces the transition temperature until saturation is reached . at the same time @xmath179 becomes steeper near the transition temperature , which may lead to an increase in @xmath180 . in case of the two - band scenario ,",
    "the different channels for impurity scattering affect the upper critical field and the transition temperature in different ways @xcite .",
    "for instance , if the bands are spherical , intraband impurity scattering increases the upper critical field , but does not change the transition temperature ( as known from the anderson theorem ) , while interband scattering modifies both quantities .",
    "consequently , in contrast to anisotropic single - band materials , the two - band scenario would allow us to increase the upper critical field without lowering the transition temperature , if we succeeded in changing impurity scattering only for a selected channel .",
    "to conclude , identifying two - band materials from measurements of the upper critical field appears hardly feasible , for the characteristic upward curvature of the upper critical field near the transition temperature and the corresponding temperature dependence of the anisotropy may also emerge in anisotropic single - band and d - wave superconductors .",
    "the anisotropies of the magnetic penetration depth and of the coherence length have often been claimed to be different in two - band superconductors , which can be verified by studying the angular dependence of the magnetic torque .",
    "we will see that the experiments have not confirmed this statement thus far . moreover , torque experiments are an efficient tool for acquiring several superconducting properties from a single measurement .",
    "the single - band ginzburg landau model for uniaxial superconductors needs but one anisotropy parameter @xmath181 , where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the effective masses of the principal crystallographic axes .",
    "the same quantities determine the ratio of the penetration depths ( @xmath184 ) and of the upper critical fields ( @xmath2 ) , i.e. , @xmath185 here , uniaxial anisotropy , with @xmath101 the uniaxial direction and @xmath173 perpendicular to it , is assumed . in equation  ( [ eqn : tor1 ] ) , the indices of the lengths indicate the flow direction ( e.g. of the currents ) and the superscripts the field orientation .",
    "the anisotropy of the coherence length is usually supposed to match that of the upper critical field : @xmath186 .",
    "the magnetic torque is defined by @xmath187 , with @xmath188 the magnetic moment of a sample with volume @xmath22 .",
    "the reversible torque of a superconductor can be derived within london theory @xcite .",
    "if we assume the magnetic induction to be equal to the applied field ( which usually holds well for not too low fields ) , we obtain @xmath189 with @xmath190 here , @xmath191 denotes the angle between the field orientation and the @xmath101-axis of the sample , @xmath192 the applied magnetic field , and @xmath193 is a parameter that depends on the vortex configuration .",
    "usually , different background signal terms are to be added .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : tor2 ] ) can be adjusted to experimental data by varying the parameters @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 freely .",
    "the magnetic penetration depth is simply a proportionality factor , the upper critical field is highly sensitive to the curvature of the torque , and the anisotropy is mainly determined by the slope near the @xmath173 direction .",
    "thus there is a good chance of determining each variable quite independently from the others .",
    "nevertheless , reducing the number of fit - parameters by taking results from other experiments , as for instance the upper critical field from squid measurements , should improve the quality of the fit procedure . usually , the reversible torque has to be acquired from the irreversible branches , obtained by measuring at opposite rotation directions .",
    "evaluation errors , in particular those for the anisotropy , will become substantial with increasing hysteresis width between the irreversible branches .    quite early , very pure single crystals of mgb@xmath0 , whose magnetic properties were almost fully reversible and which were thus excellently suited for torque experiments , have been made available @xcite . describing the torque data by equation ( [ eqn : tor2 ] )",
    "was shown to work well , as illustrated in figure  [ torque ] , and to reveal parameters in nice agreement with results from other experiments , for instance with the upper critical field and its anisotropy determined from squid magnetometry @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the anisotropies of the upper critical field @xmath197 and of the magnetic penetration depth @xmath198 were proposed to be unequal , i.e. @xmath199 , in two - band superconductors .",

    "equation [ eqn : tor3 ] ) .",
    "an upper critical field anisotropy ( @xmath204 ) of about 4 - 6 and a penetration depth anisotropy ( @xmath205 ) of about 1 - 2 were proposed for mgb@xmath0 at low temperatures @xcite ; yet , applying expression ( [ eqn : tor6 ] ) to torque data of mgb@xmath0 suggested @xmath206 , and that both anisotropies were in close agreement with @xmath196 evaluated via the single - band expression ( [ eqn : tor2 ] ) @xcite . a closer examination @xcite of equation ( [ eqn : tor6 ] ) revealed that small variations in @xmath205 increase the fit error strongly , whereas variations in @xmath204 are less significant for the case of mgb@xmath0 ; in other words , uncertainties in @xmath205 are much smaller than in @xmath204 , yet @xmath206 still holds .",
    "moreover , @xmath204 was directly determined from the upper critical fields , obtained from magnetization measurements in a squid , and found to excellently agree with @xmath205 from torque data .",

    "as far as i know , such effects have never been reported and thus no indication of such different anisotropies in mgb@xmath0 and similar materials seem to be available .",

    "we will see in section  [ sec : aniso ] , that a pronounced field dependence of the anisotropy might mainly be responsible for the reports of different values for different quantities .",
    "torque measurements were also carried out on iron - based superconductors and analyzed via equations ( [ eqn : tor2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : tor6 ] ) , but the results suffer from large hysteresis widths between the two irreversible branches . in @xcite , xfeaso@xmath209f@xmath210 (",

    "this demonstrates that @xmath204 does virtually not affect the quality of the fit and that the relation between the anisotropies could thus not be determined in this case .",
    "note that @xmath204 from the resistivity measurement referred to much higher fields than the results from the torque experiments .",

    "the method to lafeaso@xmath213f@xmath214 ( @xmath215k ) revealed a temperature and field dependent anisotropy @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the magnetic torque is not able to unveil two - band behavior of a superconductor directly , for the data are usually well described by the conventional expression , valid for single - band materials .",
    "the temperature and , in particular , the field dependence of the evaluated properties , such as the anisotropy and the magnetic penetration depth , may , however , help to identify a two - band material , as we will see later .",
    "the reversible magnetization , @xmath216 , of a superconductor is another property that may be sensitive to two - band effects .",
    "indeed , its field dependence should allow us to discriminate the two - band from the anisotropic single - band scenario .",
    "unfortunately , acquiring samples in which the reversible magnetization can be determined often proves difficult due to the interfering effects caused by flux - line pinning .",
    "measurements of the magnetic moment are routinely performed in squids and vibrating - sample - magnetometers .",
    "direct access to the reversible part is often blocked by the irreversible properties , coming along with flux - line pinning and showing up in a hysteresis of the magnetization loop .",

    "the hysteresis width can , however , be reduced by employing the so - called vortex shaking technique @xcite .    for some materials , such as mgb@xmath0 , nbse@xmath0 , v@xmath122si , nb , etc .",
    ", pure single crystals are available , in which the hysteresis is small or completely absent over a large field and temperature range .",
    "if additionally the upper critical field of that material is not too high , the reversible magnetization can be determined over a large part of the superconducting phase diagram . calculating @xmath223 , where @xmath160 is the demagnetization factor of the sample , gives @xmath224 , i.e. the reversible magnetization as a function of the magnetic induction , which we can compare with theory .",
    "the theoretical @xmath224 curve can be taken from any model ; for instance , ginzburg landau theory appears quite convenient - not only because simple interpolation formulas , provided by brandt @xcite , are available .",
    "the ginzburg landau model depends on two parameters , namely on the upper critical field , at which @xmath224 vanishes , and on the ginzburg landau parameter @xmath136 .",
    "both quantities can be acquired by fitting theory to the experimental @xmath224 data . in ginzburg",
    "landau theory , anisotropy is specified by the appropriate effective masses at the fermi surface ( cf . equation [ eqn : gl_fi1 ] ) , but it was shown that the anisotropic can be mapped onto the isotropic single - band model , when the magnetic field points along a principal axis of the sample @xcite . thus , in contrast to two - band effects , anisotropy should not significantly affect the shape of @xmath224 .    fig .",
    "[ mrev ] presents reversible magnetization curves of nbse@xmath0 and mgb@xmath0 as a function of field @xcite .",
    "the dashed lines display the best single - band ginzburg landau fits when the upper critical field is fixed by the field where the experimental data become zero .",
    "the striking differences between theory and experiment provide evidence for a non - single - band behavior in these materials .",
    "ginzburg landau theory is known to hold strictly only sufficiently close to the transition temperature and the upper critical field .",
    "as the temperature decreases , larger deviations between the ginzburg landau and the experimental behavior are likely , although we do not expect considerable qualitative effects if adjusting the parameters of the model in a convenient way .",
    "this was verified for v@xmath122si ( right inset of figure  [ mrev ] ) , for which reliable agreement was not only found at high ( @xmath225 @xmath226 0.8 ) , but also at relatively low temperatures ( @xmath225 @xmath226 0.3 - 0.4 ) @xcite , and for nb .",
    "nice matching was also reported for the anisotropic superconductors yba@xmath0cu@xmath227o@xmath228 , nd@xmath229ce@xmath230cuo@xmath231 , and yba@xmath0cu@xmath122o@xmath165 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that for all those samples two - band superconductivity has been suspected in some publications .",
    "nevertheless , i point out that for mgb@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 the disagreement between experiment and single - band theory is not essentially changed at higher temperatures .    to evaluate two - band properties",
    ", we can analyze the experimental data by applying two independent single - band fits , one for the low and one for the high field regime , as illustrated in fig .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this procedure does not yield a two - band model , for interband effects are not taken into account , but rather resembles the @xmath75-model used for fitting the specific heat ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : sh ] ) and other properties .",
    "the point is that in two - band superconductors , such as mgb@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 , the properties of one of the bands are apparently suppressed above a particular magnetic field , associated with the upper critical field of that band , and thus a nearly single - band behavior , matching the single - band ginzburg landau model , appears at high fields , while both bands significantly contribute to the superconducting state at low fields .",
    "the high - field fit reveals @xmath136 , @xmath2 , and , by applying well - known ginzburg landau relations @xcite , further critical fields and lengths as well as the anisotropy of the band with the higher upper critical field . even at low fields ,",
    "a single - band model was found to describe mgb@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 well , but the corresponding fit leads to effective quantities representing both bands , though the properties of the second band might dominate in this field region in the cases of mgb@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 .",
    "note that , although the global upper critical fields are quite different for the @xmath101 and the @xmath173 direction in these materials , the upper critical fields from the low - field fits are almost equal , as shown in figure  [ fig : bc2 ] and [ anisotropy ] .",
    "this reflects the shape of the two bands , from which one is strongly anisotropic and the second almost isotropic .",
    "the procedure not only probes two - band superconductivity , but can also reveal the field dependence of several quantities .",
    "a more elaborated model of the two - band ginzburg landau magnetization curve , including interband effects , was applied in @xcite , and let to more detailed results of the temperature and field dependence of several superconducting properties ( e.g. top right panel of figure  [ anisotropy ] ) .",
    "the above method was successfully applied to mgb@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , iron - based superconductors usually have a large hysteresis , so that the reversible part has not reliably been determined so far , which is similar to the situation in many cuprates . moreover , the upper critical fields of these materials are often much larger than the maximum field provided by the experimental equipment .",
    "to conclude , comparing the measured field dependence of the reversible magnetization with the theoretical single - band behavior appears to be a useful tool for probing two - band superconductivity .",
    "this holds at least when the superconducting properties of one of the bands are significantly suppressed at higher magnetic fields and , as a consequence , a single - band fit of @xmath224 does not match over the whole field range .",
    "using the ginzburg landau model seems sensible , though some uncertainties remain due to the restrictions of the model .",
    "the single - band fits allow us to extract the field and temperature dependence of several superconducting properties .",
    "peculiarities in the anisotropy have frequently been considered a strong confirmation of two - band superconductivity .",
    "indeed , while a temperature dependence of the anisotropy is rather common , a strong field dependence is difficult to explain by non - two - band effects .",
    "those field dependencies are mirrored by different anisotropies of , for instance , the magnetic penetration depth and the upper critical field when these properties are measured at different fields .",
    "anisotropy shows up in many superconducting properties , such as the magnetic penetration depth ( @xmath212 ) , the coherence length ( @xmath232 ) , the ginzburg landau parameter ( @xmath233 ) , the upper ( @xmath234 = @xmath204 ) , and the lower critical field ( @xmath235 ) , etc .",
    ", when different crystal directions are probed . in the following ,",
    "i will concentrate on uniaxial anisotropy , since most samples discussed in this text have uniaxial or near - uniaxial symmetry . in simple single - band materials ,",
    "all anisotropies are equal , in accordance with ginzburg landau theory , i.e. @xmath212 = @xmath232 = @xmath233 = @xmath236 = @xmath237 .    in case of two- or multi - band superconductivity ,",
    "a more complicated situation arises , as different bands may have different fermi surface shapes .",
    "in fact , when people determined the anisotropy of mgb@xmath0 they reported quite different results for different quantities and techniques .",
    "basically , the anisotropy of the upper critical field was found to be large ( @xmath238 ) at low temperature and to decrease upon warming , while that of the penetration depth small ( @xmath239 ) and to increase , so that about the same value was reached at the transition temperature @xcite .",
    "this could be explained by theory . within the eilenberger model ,",
    "the ratio of the penetration depths at 0k @xcite was found to depend only on the ratio of the fermi velocities , which gives roughly one in mgb@xmath0 , while the larger values at higher temperature were explained by the additional influence of the gap anisotropy . concerning the anisotropy of the upper critical field @xcite ,",
    "the same expression as for the penetration depths was derived at the transition temperature , which explains the experimentally observed merging of the two anisotropies at this point , while a rather large anisotropy , corresponding to the shape of the band dominating at high fields , was theoretically derived and experimentally acquired at low temperatures .",
    "it should be noted that in the above experiments and theoretical calculations , the anisotropies of the upper critical fields and penetration depths refer to different magnetic fields , namely to low or zero field in the case of the penetration depth but to high fields in the case of the upper critical field .",
    "some methods allow us to determine the penetration depth and thus @xmath212 at different magnetic fields .",
    "a simple method providing two values , one for the high and one for the low - field region , is fitting two single - band curves to the reversible magnetization , as presented in the previous subsection ( [ sec : revmag ] ) , which was reported to yield rather small values - @xmath240 nm and @xmath241 nm - at low magnetic fields , and larger values - @xmath242 nm and @xmath243 nm at high fields in mgb@xmath0 @xcite ; accordingly , also this anisotropy increased from about 1 to 4.5 with increasing field at 0k . a more elaborated evaluation of the reversible magnetization within two - band ginzburg landau theory @xcite revealed a smoother behavior of the quantities over the whole field range and basically confirmed the above mentioned trend . a quite different technique , neutron scattering by flux lines of mgb@xmath0 @xcite , suggested @xmath244 larger penetration depths , but the same trend for the field dependence of its anisotropy",
    "because talking about the field dependence of the upper critical field anisotropy does not make sense , we will turn to the closely related coherence length .",
    "the coherence length , acquired from the reversible magnetization of mgb@xmath0 @xcite , was reported to be about 10.7 and 2.3 nm at high and 17.4 and 34 nm at low fields , which gives an anisotropy comparable with that of the penetration depth in the same field regime .",
    "again , similar but more reliable results were obtained from the two - band ginzburg landau model @xcite .",
    "klein et al .",
    "@xcite determined the field dependence of the coherence length from the sommerfeld coefficient by assuming @xmath245 to be proportional to the core size ( @xmath246 ) and to the number of vortices ( @xmath247 ) , i.e. @xmath248 ; their experimental finding that @xmath249 of mgb@xmath0 roughly behaves like @xmath250 resulted in @xmath251 .",
    "a strong field dependence of the coherence length was also suggested from scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of the vortex core , indicating that the low - field coherence length might be much larger ( factor @xmath238 ) than that expected from ginzburg landau theory at the upper critical field @xcite ( @xmath252 ) . in nbse@xmath0 ,",
    "muon spin rotation measurements @xcite showed the coherence length to decrease strongly with increasing field at low fields and to become almost constant above a certain field , associated with the upper critical field of the first band , which confirmed the results from the reversible magnetization in this material @xcite .",
    "the same held for the magnetic penetration depth .",
    "it should be noted that a field dependent coherence length is not a specific property of multi - band materials but shows up even in s - wave single - band materials by a roughly @xmath253 behavior @xcite , which is a consequence of vortex overlapping and the corresponding delocalization of core quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "the field dependence turned out to be particularly large in clean samples and at low temperatures and might even become comparable with the effect in mgb@xmath0 or nbse@xmath0 for @xmath87 , where @xmath254 , but for @xmath175 , these ratios may be larger in the two - band materials .",
    "furthermore , an abrupt change , as seen in nbse@xmath0 @xcite due to the suppression of one of the bands , is not expected in conventional materials .",
    "we see that the anisotropies of the coherence length and of the magnetic penetration depth display similar behavior in several two - band superconductors , such as mgb@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 .",
    "they are not only temperature but also significantly field dependent , as can be seen in figure  [ anisotropy ] .",
    "for instance , the anisotropies of mgb@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 are small at low fields , increase strongly with field , and are rather constant at high fields .",
    "obviously that reflects the dominant influence of the more isotropic band at low and that of the more anisotropic band a high fields .",
    "the correspondence of the coherence length and the penetration depth anisotropy at all fields and temperatures can not unambiguously be proved experimentally but has not been refuted by the known experiments thus far .",
    "at least , the anisotropies were shown to differ not significantly , as was also confirmed by the torque results of section ( [ sec : torque ] ) . moreover ,",
    "the anisotropy of the lower critical field of mgb@xmath0 @xcite , which naturally corresponds to the low - field regime , was found to be in reasonable agreement with the low - field @xmath212 . also , the anisotropy of the sommerfeld coefficient , acquired from specific heat measurements at different magnetic fields , agreed with the other anisotropies @xcite . finally , direct tunneling spectroscopy measurements indicated a small vortex lattice anisotropy , i.e. an almost undistorted hexagonal lattice , and rather circular vortex cores at low fields perpendicular to @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the low - field penetration depth and the high - field upper critical field anisotropies are significantly different in the iron - based superconductors as well , though their functionalities are contrary to mgb@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 , as illustrated in figure  [ anisotropy ] .",
    "the question of different anisotropies at the same field and temperature has not been addressed thus far .",
    "torque data could be well described by the single - band model with equal anisotropies and at the same time by a model including different anisotropies @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "considering a significant amount of experiments on mgb@xmath0 and similar materials leads us to the suggestion that the anisotropies of the superconducting properties , in particular of the penetration depth and the coherence length , are equal or almost equal in these two - band samples .",
    "these anisotropies change with temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the field dependence of the characteristic lengths and of their anisotropies reflects the properties and anisotropies of the different bands .",
    "the situation is currently unsettled in the iron - based materials .",
    "the most direct evidence for two - band superconductivity should be gained from a measurement of the energy gap structure on the fermi surface , which appears to be a straightforward task .",
    "however , things are again not that simple as we will see in the following .",
    "for instance , not all energy gaps necessarily show up in tunneling or point - contact spectroscopy measurements ; moreover , anisotropy would also lead to varying gap values .",
    "finally , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , which allows a direct assignment of gaps to certain bands , does not work for all materials .",
    "studying two - band materials with distinct gaps reveals two independent gaps with bcs - like temperature behavior and two different transitions when interband coupling is ignored . according to calculations @xcite , slightly turning on interband coupling hardly changes the larger gap , while the lower gap curve should become flat near its single - band transition , so that it eventually vanishes at the same temperature as the larger gap , as indicated in figure  [ fig : eliashb ] .",

    "a second band was shown to entail an additional peak or shoulder in the density of states , as recently reviewed in @xcite .",

    "moreover , the energy resolution may be an issue in some cases .",

    "finally , several arpes studies , showing up to 5 gaps on 5 different fermi surface sheets , have been performed on the iron - based materials @xcite .    to conclude , finding two peaks or a peak and a shoulder in tunneling or point - contact spectroscopy measurements provides confirmation of a two - band system , though the anisotropic single - band scenario can not be completely excluded .",
    "on the other hand , the absence of such structures does certainly not disprove two - band superconductivity .",

    "in this section , i will describe several materials for which attributes of two- or multi - band superconductivity have been reported .",
    "i will mainly take those into account that have been investigated after the discovery of mgb@xmath0 , as this was the origin of a broader comprehension of the phenomenon , while earlier reports on two - band effects in materials , such as nb @xcite , ta @xcite , v @xcite , nb - doped srtio@xmath122 @xcite , mo@xmath284tc@xmath285 @xcite , etc .",
    ", are not further discussed here . in the following , the more prominent materials , namely mgb@xmath0 , nbse@xmath0 ( with nbs@xmath0 )",
    ", iron - based superconductors , cuprates , and borocarbides , will be introduced in some detail .",
    "then several other potential two - band superconductors are presented more briefly .",
    "the list is not exhaustive , but i hope that not too many important materials were missed . in some of these materials ,",
    "multi - band superconductivity is quite well established , in others the situation has yet to be clarified by further experiments , and in some the reports are rather questionable .",
    "i will mainly report on experimental data suggesting support or confirmation of the two - band state , and i will not point out possible different interpretations , for instance in terms of anisotropic single - band behavior , in each case .      since the discovery of its superconductivity in 2001 @xcite ,",
    "mgb@xmath0 has become one of the most intensively studied superconducting materials , not only because of its potential for applications , but also because it was the first material in which two - band effects have been established .",
    "today , it can be considered as the prototype of a two - band superconductor , with which other two - band candidates are compared , and to which most theoretical calculations refer .",
    "mgb@xmath0 has a hexagonal crystal structure , built up by a hexagonal magnesium cell and a ring of 6 boron atoms in the interior .",
    "the lattice parameters are about 0.31 and 0.35 nm .",
    "the fermi surface of mgb@xmath0 was calculated by several groups and found to be not very complicated , though quite anisotropic @xcite .",
    "four bands crossing the fermi surface were identified , two @xmath17-bands that have cylindrical shape and are strongly anisotropic , and two @xmath72-bands that are rather isotropic .",
    "the @xmath17-bands are usually treated as one ( @xmath17 ) band and likewise the @xmath72-bands , making a two - band description feasible .",
    "the energy gap has s - wave symmetry and opens on all bands ; the corresponding absolute values are around 7mev in the @xmath17 and 2mev in the @xmath72-band .",
    "two - band effects are experimentally observable because both bands have similar densities of states and thus contribute to superconductivity significantly but at the same time diverge considerably in their properties .    a multitude of experiments and in particular their quantitative agreement with theoretical results established that electron - phonon interaction drives superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "for instance , measurements of the transition temperature showed the isotope effect , namely @xmath286 , where @xmath287 is the mass of the element , with exponents @xmath288 for boron @xcite and @xmath289 for magnesium @xcite , which could be well reproduced by eliashberg theory @xcite .",
    "thus , apart from the two - band effects , mgb@xmath0 is classified as a conventional superconductor .",
    "the two - band nature of mgb@xmath0 was suggested quite early and confirmed by many experiments , yet most of them can also be interpreted by other models as discussed in the previous sections .",
    "some of these experiments have been described above ( cf .",
    ", for instance , figures  [ sepmodel1 ] , [ sepmodel2 ] , [ fig : sommerfeld ] , [ fig : thermh ] , [ sfldensity ] , [ torque ] , [ mrev ] , [ anisotropy ] , and [ gap ] ) and shall not again be discussed here ; more can be found in review papers , such as refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein .",
    "unambiguous evidence that energy gaps exist on two different bands was given by arpes experiments @xcite , showing @xmath290 on the @xmath17 and about 2mev on the @xmath72-band at low temperatures .",
    "interesting effects are revealed when mgb@xmath0 is probed in different magnetic fields . due to interband interactions , both bands have the same upper critical fields , but as the field increases the relative contribution of the @xmath72-band to the overall superconducting quantities apparently diminishes , so that eventually the @xmath17-band dominates .",
    "the field above which the @xmath72-band becomes negligible , which is around 1 t at low temperatures , is usually denoted the second upper critical field of this band ( yet , due to interband coupling , traces of superconductivity are still expected at higher fields ) .",
    "the suppression of the @xmath72-band makes the field dependence of diverse properties different from that of an anisotropic single - band material .",
    "for instance , the anisotropic single - band model was shown to fail in describing the reversible magnetization of mgb@xmath0 over the whole field range from 0 t to @xmath2 @xcite . instead",
    ", a single - band fit worked well only for fields above the @xmath72-band upper critical field , thus indicating a near single - band ( @xmath17 ) behavior at high fields in agreement with the above mentioned suppression of the @xmath72-band .",
    "the corresponding @xmath17-band properties were reported to be about 3 t for the upper , 0.07 t for the lower , and 0.3 t for the thermodynamic critical field , as well as 77 nm for the magnetic penetration depth and 11 nm for the coherence length for fields parallel to @xmath101 at 0k .",
    "the low - field region could be described by a different single - band fit , but the corresponding results include both @xmath72 and @xmath17-band contributions and are thus effective parameters only , though more indicative of the @xmath72-band . for fields parallel to @xmath101 and low temperatures , an upper critical field of about 1 t , a lower critical field of 0.11 t , a magnetic penetration depth of about 51 nm and a coherence length of 17 nm were determined for this region .",
    "those absolute values are in good agreement with a more sophisticated two - band evaluation of the reversible magnetization that gives a smooth field dependence of the properties @xcite . to conclude , most quantities depend on the magnetic field in a different way than expected from single - band theory .",
    "like the characteristic fields and lengths , also the corresponding anisotropies change with magnetic field . at the upper critical field , the anisotropy",
    "is mainly determined by the @xmath17-band and thus about 4.5 .",
    "as the field decreases , the anisotropy remains almost constant at the beginning and is then , starting at about the upper critical field of the @xmath72-band , continuously reduced to about 1 at 0 t due to the emerging influence of the @xmath72-band .",
    "close to the transition temperature , the field dependence of the anisotropy becomes considerably weaker .",
    "as for the temperature dependence , the high - field anisotropy is about 4.5 over a large range and slightly decreases close to the transition temperature , while at low fields , the quantity is about 1 over a large range and slightly increases close to the transition temperature , as shown in figure  [ anisotropy ] .",
    "the experimental differences between the anisotropies of different quantities , such as between the coherence length and the penetration depth , at the same field and the same temperature were found to be small , and are usually within the expected experimental uncertainties @xcite . assuming the anisotropy of all relevant quantities to be equal in mgb@xmath0",
    ", we can nicely explain most of the diverging reports on this property in the literature by considering the field dependence of the anisotropy .",
    "nbse@xmath0 is one of the most interesting and most studied superconductors .",
    "although its properties have been analyzed for many years , its two - band character was realized only recently in the wake of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "today , there is little doubt that nbse@xmath0 is a multi - band superconductor .",
    "the two - band effects that show up in this material are quite similar to those of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "nbse@xmath0 has a layered structure with a hexagonal unit cell .",
    "the layers consist of two parallel se planes and a nb plane in between . along the uniaxial @xmath101-axis , these layers are only weakly bound by van der waals forces .",
    "the transition temperature of nbse@xmath0 is about 7.2k and its upper critical field about 4 in @xmath101 and 12 t in @xmath173 ( perpendicular to @xmath101 ) direction @xcite , giving an anisotropy of 3 .",
    "accordingly , most parts of the superconducting phase diagram are available for experiments . moreover , large pure single crystals , whose superconducting magnetic properties are reversible over most of the phase diagram , can be grown .",
    "thanks to the properties mentioned above , nbse@xmath0 is well suited for a wide range of investigations . in particular , its layered structure makes preparing an atomically flat surface by cleaving a crystal along the @xmath173 planes easy , and , in contrast to most other materials , this surface is very stable even in air . therefore , nbse@xmath0 was the first material to which scanning tunneling microscopy was successfully applied for imaging vortex cores @xcite and distributions @xcite ( at arbitrary magnetic fields ) , and it is still widely used for such investigations . below about 33k",
    "we can study the charge density wave state @xcite and at even lower temperatures its possible competition with the superconducting gap @xcite .",
    "the existence of high quality single crystals , showing almost no vortex pinning effects , allows us to investigate the reversible magnetic properties and by introducing small defects suitable for vortex pinning the second magnetization peak @xcite ( fishtail ) .    following the discovery of mgb@xmath0",
    ", new experiments were carried out on nbse@xmath0 and interpreted in terms of a two - band scenario , although most could as well be described by the anisotropic single - band model .",
    "some of these experiments were presented in the previous sections and partly illustrated in figures  [ fig : bc2 ] , [ mrev ] , and [ anisotropy ] .",
    "the fermi surface of nbse@xmath0 was found to consist of three bands , two rather anisotropic ( nb 4d derived ) bands and a more three dimensional ( se 4p ) band @xcite .",
    "arpes @xcite revealed gaps of about 0.9 - 1.0 mev at 5.3k on the two cylindrical bands , while no gap was detected on the se - band .",
    "later , a gap variation from 0.3 to 1.2 mev was measured , though again on the two nb bands @xcite , which was in better agreement with tunneling spectroscopy showing a gap range from about 0.4 to 1.4 mev close to 0k @xcite .",
    "two - band fits resulted in gaps of 0.73 and 1.26 mev from the specific heat @xcite and in comparable values from penetration depth measurements @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that the field dependence of the reversible magnetization of a nbse@xmath0 single crystal @xcite can not be properly described by a single - band but by a simplified two - band model . separating the reversible magnetization into a high- and a low - field region allowed assessing some two - band properties by fitting single - band ginzburg landau theory to both regions separately , in the same way as done for mgb@xmath0 . as in mgb@xmath0 ,",
    "single - band behavior was found in the high - field and two - band behavior in the low - field region .",
    "the field below which effects of the second band emerge is usually proclaimed the upper critical field of this band and was found at about 2 t for both field orientations at 0k , as shown in figure  [ fig : bc2 ] . it was concluded that at least two bands contribute to the superconducting state of nbse@xmath0 , one is rather isotropic and suppressed above roughly 2 t ( at 0k ) , and the second is strongly anisotropic ( @xmath291 ) .",
    "it appears natural to identify the isotropic part with the more three dimensional se 4p band , but it should be recalled that arpes did not indicate a gap on this band ( at 5.3k ) , hence this point remains to be clarified . as in mgb@xmath0 , the anisotropy of nbse@xmath0 was reported to change strongly with applied field , namely from a large value of about 3 at high fields to almost isotropic behavior at low fields and to depend only slightly on the temperature .",
    "no significant differences in the anisotropy of the characteristic lengths were detected when acquired at the same field and temperature ( cf .",
    "figure  [ anisotropy ] ) .",
    "nbs@xmath0 belongs to the same family , nbx@xmath0 , with x a chalcogen element , as nbse@xmath0 and exhibits similar behavior .",
    "its transition temperature is slightly lower , about 6k , while the upper critical field anisotropy rises to about 7 - 8 @xcite .",
    "tunneling spectroscopy revealed one peak at about 1 and one shoulder at about 0.5 mev in the density of states @xcite ; similar gap values resulted from a two - band fit to specific heat data @xcite and to the superfluid density @xcite .",
    "although these results do not prove nbs@xmath0 to be a two - band superconductor , its close relation to nbse@xmath0 makes it probable .",
    "though the first of the new iron - based superconductors was discovered in 2006 ( laofep @xcite ; @xmath292k ) , the current boom broke out only after a much higher transition temperature , namely 26k @xcite , was reported for lao@xmath125f@xmath126feas .",
    "since then , a lot of materials with similar iron structures , reaching transition temperatures of up to 56k , have been discovered .",
    "the main components of this kind of superconductors are the parallel fex layers with x a pnictogen ( usually p or as ) or , less frequently , a chalcogen ( se , te , and s ) atom .",
    "the pure layers form the so - called 11 family with transition temperatures of up to 14k ( fete@xmath293se@xmath125 ) .",
    "putting an additional layer between the fex blocks yields further families .",
    "most investigated are 122 materials with alkaline earth metals , such as ba , sr , and ca , in between ( e.g. bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ) , 111 with alkali metals ( e.g. lifeas ) , and 1111 with lno layers , where ln is a metal of the lanthanide series ( la , ce , sm , nd , etc . ) , e.g. lafeaso .",
    "almost all elements can be partly replaced by different dopants , which may have great effects on the superconducting properties .",
    "the highest transition temperatures of about 56k were observed in the 1111 family .",
    "the unit cells are usually orthorhombic , though the in - plane anisotropy of the lattice parameters is almost negligible . for recent reviews",
    "see @xcite .",
    "many properties of the iron - based superconductors resemble those of the cuprates .",
    "for instance , antiferromagnetism appears in both materials in the strongly underdoped regime but is successively suppressed by doping .",
    "eventually , antiferromagnetism vanishes and superconductivity , with a dome - like shaped transition temperature as a function of doping , shows up . in both materials",
    "the superconducting pairing mechanism is yet to be found , though electron - phonon coupling is excluded by most people , while spin fluctuations are a good candidate .",
    "contrary to the cuprates , the iron - based materials are metallic in the underdoped regime . moreover , the order parameters of the materials are apparently different , namely d - wave symmetry in the cuprates but most likely s - wave in most iron - based .",
    "though many aspects of the iron - based superconductors are not settled , there is little doubt that they are multi - band materials .",
    "it was theoretically and experimentally shown that most materials have two anisotropic electron fermi sheet pockets around the m symmetry point of the brillouin zone and at least two anisotropic hole pockets around the @xmath196 point ; additional hole pockets around @xmath196 that may be more isotropic have occasionally been reported .",
    "the superconducting order parameter is commonly believed to have s - wave symmetry and to appear on the hole and the electron fermi surface sheets and is supposed to change its sign , in other words the phases might differ by an angle @xmath72 on different sheets , which defines the so - called @xmath127 scenario .",
    "the question of whether the electron band - gap has ( accidental ) nodes or not has been discussed more controversially .",
    "both viewpoints have been supported by a couple of experiments . at present , there are indications that different scenarios may prevail in different samples . in particular , it was reported @xcite that optimally",
    "doped ba211 samples might have a fully gapped order parameter , while under- and overdoping might induce nodes .",
    "a review of the gap symmetry and structure was recently presented @xcite .",
    "a large number of experiments has been published on the multi - band nature of the iron - based superconductors .",
    "of particular interest are angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements , as such experiments are capable of revealing the energy gap at different positions of the fermi surface ( restricted to the sample surface , however ) .",
    "results on different samples suggest gaps on several fermi sheets with different values .",
    "for instance , in ba@xmath285k@xmath284fe@xmath0as@xmath0 , gaps of about 12mev were assigned to the anisotropic hole and the electron sheets , and a smaller 6mev gap to a larger hole sheet also surrounding the @xmath196 point @xcite . a more recent study on lifeas revealed ( nodeless ) gaps on all four fermi sheets , with larger gap values of around 4 - 5 mev on one of the two hole and one of the two electron - like sheets and",
    "smaller values of around 2.5 - 2.8 mev on the remaining sheets @xcite .",
    "gaps on five sheets were identified in bafe@xmath0(as@xmath294p@xmath295)@xmath0 @xcite . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the results indicate up to five superconducting bands in the iron - based materials , but since the gap magnitudes seem to cluster around two different values , one larger and one smaller than the bcs gap , a two - band description might be sufficient for describing most properties .",
    "further experimental results have partly been mentioned in the previous sections .",
    "for instance , specific heat measurements have been carried out on different samples .",
    "in contrast to the isotropic single - band model , the two - band model usually worked well , though a shoulder at intermediate temperatures , like that in mgb@xmath0 , was observed only in some iron - based samples .",
    "the two - band evaluations typically resulted in gaps in the ratio of two to three , one gap larger and one gap lower than the bcs prediction .",
    "the corresponding weights of the density of states were about 0.3 : 0.7 to 0.5 : 0.5 ( or even 0.1 : 0.9 in one case ) @xcite .",

    "an upward curvature of the upper critical field emerges for magnetic fields perpendicular to a uniaxial or near - uniaxial crystal axis , but in the iron - based materials , this feature was observed for fields parallel to this axis and , contrary to other materials , to appear over the whole or a large part of the temperature range in some samples ( e.g. 1111 and 122 ) @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : bc2 ] ) . for fields parallel to the iron layers ( @xmath175 ) ,",
    "higher upper critical fields , displaying no or only a slight upward curvature near the transition temperature , were measured . at low temperatures ,",
    "the upper critical fields of many iron - based samples rise beyond the pauli paramagnetic limit , which is about 1.84 @xmath19 in units of tesla in the bcs limit , and the curves thus become noticeably flatter .",
    "the corresponding zeeman energy is rather isotropic , which could partly explain why the upper critical field anisotropy of iron - based superconductors was found to grow with increasing temperature @xcite , which is contrary to the behavior of most other known two - band superconductors , as illustrated in figure  [ anisotropy ] , and to anisotropic single - band superconductors .",
    "the maximum anisotropy near the transition temperature was reported between about 2 and 7 . for a review of the upper critical fields in the iron - based materials ,",
    "see @xcite .    as for the anisotropy of the iron - based superconductors",
    ", we can summarize that the low - field penetration depth anisotropy was reported to decrease while the upper critical field anisotropy to increase upon warming @xcite towards a common value at the transition temperature ( @xmath297 2 - 7 ) .",
    "this resembles the behavior of mgb@xmath0 when the upper critical field and the penetration depth anisotropy behaviors are swapped , as depicted in figure  [ anisotropy ] .",
    "the temperature dependence of the penetration depth anisotropy is usually assumed to be a consequence of the multi - band character , while that of the upper critical field of the pauli paramagnetism limit , but microscopic confirmations and detailed multi - band model calculations are yet to be provided for this material . in mgb@xmath0",
    "the differences seem to disappear when the anisotropies , e.g. of the penetration depth and the coherence length , are determined at the same field and temperature .",
    "this issue has not been addressed in the iron - based samples thus far , though torque measurements @xcite did not indicate an unconventional behavior ( e.g. additional nodes in the reversible torque vs. angle curve ) as it may be the case for different anisotropies .",
    "tunneling spectroscopy has been carried out on several samples , though uncertainties due to sample surface quality issues are to be expected .",
    "moreover , it was predicted that tunneling mainly probes the bands around the @xmath196 point , whereas the electron pockets around @xmath287 provide only negligible contributions to the tunneling current @xcite , which might explain the single - band behavior found in many tunneling spectroscopy studies .",
    "nevertheless , two gaps were resolved in @xcite ba(fe@xmath125co@xmath126)@xmath0as@xmath0 and @xcite ba@xmath285k@xmath298fe@xmath0as@xmath0 , in both cases with a gap ratio of about 1 : 2 . for a review ,",

    "gradually reduces their neel temperature to zero and eventually induces the superconducting state , displaying a dome - like shape in the transition temperature versus doping diagram .",
    "optimal doping refers to the maximum transition temperature .",
    "the cuprates are classified as extreme type ii superconductors , for their ginzburg landau parameter is often in the range of 100 , they have the highest - known transition temperatures thus far , and their anisotropy reaches values from about 5 to more than 100 .",
    "a lot of questions concerning these materials are still not resolved including that on the mechanism responsible for cooper - pairing .",
    "the most frequently mentioned candidate is the coupling by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which should lead to d - wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "there is wide consensus that d - wave symmetry predominates in the cuprates @xcite , yet not all experiments are in full agreement with this assumption .",

    "@xcite determined the in - plane magnetic penetration depth of la@xmath304sr@xmath305cuo@xmath227 by muon - spin rotation and found the temperature dependence of the superfluid density to rise abruptly below about 10k at low magnetic fields , which was no longer observed at higher fields ( @xmath306 t ) .",
    "this anomaly was assumed to indicate a second band .",
    "fitting the curves with the two - band @xmath75-model revealed gap values of 8.2mev for the dominant d - wave band and 1.6mev for the second band , for which s - wave character was supposed .",

    "nevertheless , deviations from a pure d - wave symmetry were suggested , and a @xmath307 symmetry was proposed @xcite .",
    "not all unexpected results in the cuprates have been interpreted in terms of a second band .",
    "for instance , wojek et .",
    "al @xcite reproduced the low - temperature low - field anomaly of the superfluid density in la@xmath304sr@xmath305cuo@xmath227 but attributed it to vortex pinning effects and were thus able to describe the whole temperature dependence with a single d - wave gap - band .",

    "possible two - band effects were indicated by an upward curvature of the upper critical field near the transition temperature @xcite , but alternative explanations related to the interplay with the ferromagnetic phase were also provided @xcite .",
    "many superconducting properties and potential two - band effects as well as several two - band candidate materials have been reviewed .",
    "the two - band effects were compared with those expected from anisotropy in the single - band model and , in some cases , with those from different energy gap structures .",
    "basically , the temperature dependence of many properties was found to be similar in the two - band and in the anisotropic single - band model , making a distinction between the two scenarios difficult in these cases . on the other hand , the field dependencies may be quite different in the two models because in two - band materials , such as mgb@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 , superconductivity is apparently suppressed in one of the bands at sufficiently high fields , making the field dependent behavior of some properties a better candidate for successfully discriminating the two - band from other scenarios .    in section  [ sec : models ] , the theoretical results predicted by the two - band and by other models within ginzburg landau , separable model , bcs , quasi - classical model , and eliashberg theory have been reviewed .",
    "the main results are :    * many experimentally observed two - band effects can be well reproduced by the theoretical models , even when we assume simple spherical fermi surfaces .",
    "this indicates that basic properties of two - band superconductors do not strongly rely on details but rather on the averaged values of the anisotropy and the coupling strength .",
    "* ignoring coupling between the two bands , which are assumed to have distinctly different energy gap magnitudes and may differ also in other properties , leads to two transitions in the temperature dependence of diverse properties , such as the specific heat , superfluid density , etc .",
    "as interband coupling or interband impurity scattering is enhanced , the low - temperature transition , usually referring to the band with the smaller gap , is washed out and eventually fades away , making the curves similar to single - band behavior .",
    "any small interband interaction leads to a common transition temperature and upper critical field of both bands , though superconductivity of one band may be strongly suppressed above a certain magnetic field , which is then usually denoted the upper critical field of that band . *",
    "increasing the gap ratio or the coupling strength often has opposite effects .",
    "for instance , the specific heat jump becomes lower as the gap ratio increases , but it becomes higher as the coupling or interband interaction increases .",
    "similarly , the low - temperature specific heat and the superfluid density change more rapidly with temperature as the gap ratio increases but more slowly as coupling increases . * the upward curvature of the upper critical field is sensitive to several properties but basically appears and becomes more prominent as the fermi velocity ratio becomes larger . *",
    "the separable model can be interpreted as an anisotropic single - band as well as a two - band model with two spherical fermi surfaces .",
    "anisotropy effects in a single - band material and two - band effects would thus lead to the same unconventional behavior in this model , making a distinction between the two scenarios by comparing the temperature dependence of experimental data with theoretical models often problematic .    in section  [ sec : exp ] , several experimental techniques were briefly described and some results obtained for possible two - band and other materials reviewed .",
    "two - band effects , in most cases investigated in mgb@xmath0 , have been found to result in the following modifications :    * the _ specific heat _",
    "increases more rapidly upon warming at low temperatures , and its jump - height at the transition temperature is reduced .",
    "a kink may show up at elevated temperatures if not suppressed by large interband coupling or impurity scattering .",
    "basically , the same effects are predicted for the anisotropic single - band model .",
    "* as the applied magnetic field increases , the _ sommerfeld coefficient _ was found to grow rapidly at low fields and , when superconductivity is suppressed in one of the bands , to grow at a lower rate at high fields .",
    "experiments indicate that distinguishing this behavior from that in non - two - band materials might prove difficult .",
    "* the field dependence of the low - temperature _ thermal conductivity _ was reported to be rather flat at intermediate , and steep at low and high fields , which again is similarly predicted for anisotropy effects .",
    "* as the temperature increases , the _ superfluid density _ decreases faster at low and may become linear or even convex at intermediate temperatures .",
    "the same holds for the anisotropic single - band model .",
    "* the curvature of the _ upper critical field",
    "_ may become positive near the transition temperature as is also well - known for non - two - band materials having a non - spherical fermi surface . in some iron - based superconductors , the upward curvature stretches over the whole temperature range . *",
    "the angular dependence of the _ magnetic torque _ usually fits the conventional single - band model quite well , assuming the same anisotropy for the coherence length and the magnetic penetration depth , even in two - band samples . *",
    "in contrast to the anisotropic single - band model , the _ reversible magnetization _ of two - band superconductors can not be well described by the single - band ginzburg landau theory over the whole field range . instead ,",
    "two fits , one for the low and one for the high - field regime , are needed , which reflects the different upper critical fields of the two bands .",
    "* the _ anisotropy _ may change significantly with magnetic field . in mgb@xmath0 and nbse@xmath0 ,",
    "the anisotropy is high at high and low at low magnetic fields , explained by a strongly anisotropic band dominating at high fields and an almost isotropic band dominating at low fields in these materials .",
    "the high - field anisotropy decreases , while the low - field anisotropy increases upon warming , so that both seem to merge at the transition temperature .",
    "no significant differences of the anisotropies of different properties have been observed when the results refer to the same field and temperature .",
    "the situation appears different in the iron - based superconductors , where the high - field upper critical field anisotropy was found to be small and that of the low - field magnetic penetration depth rather large .",
    "* measurements of the _ superconducting gaps _ by tunneling or point - contact spectroscopy may reveal a single peak , two peaks , or a peak and a shoulder in the energy dependence of the electrical conductance .",
    "anisotropy in single - band materials may lead to similar structures .",
    "a clear proof of gaps on different bands can be provided by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy .      * _ mgb@xmath0 _ , being unquestionably a two - band superconductor , consists of a quite isotropic band having a rather small s - wave energy gap and a quite anisotropic band having a large s - wave energy gap . in the isotropic band",
    ", superconductivity is obviously suppressed at sufficiently high magnetic fields .",
    "most results and explanations of this review refer to this material . *",
    "_ nbse@xmath0 _ has unconventional properties that are often amazingly similar to those of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "as in mgb@xmath0 the experiments indicate an isotropic band with a small gap and an anisotropic band with a large gap as well as suppression of superconductivity in the isotropic band at high fields .",
    "possible two - band effects have also been found in _ nbs@xmath0_. * concerning the _ iron - based superconductors _ , the whole family is widely accepted to show two- or multi - band superconductivity , though many of their properties deviate significantly from those of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the fermi surface is crossed by several bands on which a superconducting gap opens . these gaps might have s - wave symmetry though different signs on different bands and nodes may exist in some cases . *",
    "the _ cuprates _ are actually known for their d - wave character , but some experiments could not be explained within this model .",
    "for instance , a significant boost of the superfluid density at low temperatures measured by muon - spin rotation was regarded as evidence for a second band by one group of authors but as an effect coming just from vortex pinning by another group . *",
    "the _ borocarbides _ were analyzed within different models .",
    "a possible two - band scenario has been confirmed by many experimental and theoretical results showing similar properties as in mgb@xmath0 , though a clear distinction to all other models is currently not fully accepted .",
    "* a lot of other materials were considered as two - band superconductors on the basis of various experiments . in some of these materials ,",

    "<S> two - band superconductivity has become an important topic over the last ten years . </S>",
    "<S> extensive experimental and theoretical studies started with mgb@xmath0 and are now focused on the iron - based and other new superconductors . in this review , </S>",
    "<S> i describe how important thermodynamic , reversible mixed - state , and other superconducting properties are changed by two - band and , for comparison , by other effects such as anisotropy in a single - band material or an energy gap structure different from the conventional s - wave symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the work consists of three main parts , in which i review ( i ) theoretical models and what they predict for experimentally accessible properties in the two - band and other scenarios , ( ii ) experimental methods applied for investigating superconducting properties and the results obtained in potential two - band materials , and ( iii ) materials , for which two- or multi - band superconductivity has been suggested . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that two - band effects appear in most of the analyzed properties and that they can be quite significant but usually fade away as interband interactions increase . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropy often leads to similar modifications in single - band superconductors , which is why the distinction of two - band and anisotropy effects is usually difficult , particularly when the temperature dependence of the quantities is examined . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the field dependent effects are more often different and thus more often allow a reliable distinction between the models . </S>"
