    "mass transfer in inhomogeneous media and complex systems is often governed by nonclassical diffusion laws and exhibits peculiar transport effects .",
    "specific examples include sub- or superdiffusion processes of , for example , brownian particles in hydrodynamic flow @xcite , and absolute negative mobility effect @xcite .",
    "very often , studying such effects we encounter a situation where relaxation goes in counterintuitive way , namely , instead of expected spreading density distribution undergoes compression , at least over certain time period , or even full collapse . in other words ,",
    "mass transport is directed from low to high density region . in particular ,",
    "such behavior occurs in systems with absolute negative mobility or negative diffusion coefficient .",
    "the phenomenon of absolute negative mobility or negative diffusion coefficient may be of different origin .",
    "in particular , it can occur due to time- or particle - particle correlations , or nonequilibrium character of a process .",
    "this effect was demonstrated , for example , in electron - hole plasma , as an electron - drag effect arising from an electron - hole scattering @xcite , in models of interacting brownian particles @xcite or interacting lattice gas @xcite , and for nonequilibrium dynamics of brownian particle in a periodic one - dimensional potential or a quasi one - dimensional channel in a presence of external force periodic in time @xcite .",
    "note that the negative sign of diffusion coefficient entails absolute instability in a system and may signify the onset of a new phase formation , e.g. , nuclei growth at first order phase transition @xcite or collapse of electron - hole plasma that may be a precursor for a neutral exciton formation . @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of mass transfer from low to high density region also may be caused by an interaction of particles with medium inhomogeneity . in this case density relaxation through this interaction may go much faster than via diffusion process , and , as a result , the latter may not be a main relaxation and entropy production mechanism @xcite .",
    "a simple , although speculative , example of such a density relaxation is a non - wettability effect , caused by interaction between a liquid drop and a substrate ( medium ) .",
    "analogous effect in diffusive systems will be of primary interest in this paper .    here",
    "we demonstrate that such an effect may naturally appear for diffusing particles in inhomogeneous media . in this case density relaxation dynamics in a subdiffusive regime",
    "can be locally accompanied by compression of density distribution . moreover , in a stationary case , mass transport through the inhomogeneous sample can go from a boundary with low concentration to a boundary with that of high one .    in order to demonstrate these effects we resort to the simplest model of a two - component lattice gas assuming that every lattice site can be occupied by one particle only ( excluded volume constraint ) . in the limiting case of a frozen or static component",
    "this model reduces to the mass transport of mobile component in the inhomogeneous medium .",
    "another reason to use such a model is an appearance of a drag effects , which has been found in this framework in a presence of driving field and nonzero particle hopping rates of both components , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in addition , absolute negative mobility effect may appear in a case of non - markov dynamics @xcite .",
    "two component lattice gas may also display memory effects .",
    "for example , correlation between jumps of tagged particle and its influence on tracer diffusion was examined in @xcite .",
    "this correlation represents the tendency of a tagged particle to return to its previous position and it follows from : ( i ) a presence of different particle sort , i.e. particle distinguishability , and ( ii ) the excluded volume constraint .",
    "the latter corresponds to infinite repulsion energy between particles at the same lattice site .",
    "formally , such `` back correlations '' describe a repulsion of a tagged atom from the other gas component .",
    "we consider the simplest model of a two - component lattice gas on a regular lattice , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that every lattice site can be occupied by a single particle of a sort @xmath0 or @xmath1 only .",
    "particles can hop between neighboring sites separated by a distance @xmath2 with rates @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . hopping events",
    "are assumed to be instantaneous , i.e. , particle spends most of the time being localized on a lattice site .",
    "rate equations for occupation numbers can be written as @xcite    [ 1 ] @xmath5 , \\label{1a}\\ ] ] @xmath6 .",
    "\\label{1b}\\ ] ]    here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are local occupation numbers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles sort at @xmath9th site , respectively , and sum is taken over nearest neighbors of @xmath9th site only .",
    "equations ( [ 1 ] ) are based on the assumption that it is possible to neglect fluctuations in the number of jumps between sites @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite , and terms of the type @xmath11 gives a mean number of jumps ( of @xmath0-particle from site @xmath10 to site @xmath9 per time @xmath12 in this particular case ) .    in what follows",
    "we shall restrict our study to a macroscopic dynamics .",
    "the simplest , if somewhat rough , way to obtain evolution equations for the average local occupation numbers @xmath13 ( @xmath14 being statistical average ) is to apply the mean field approximation @xcite or the local equilibrium approximation @xcite .",
    "the latter corresponds to the introduction of a local chemical potential associated with a given lattice site , or a coarsened zubarev statistical operator @xcite . in this approach",
    "we lose all the information on fast ( as compared to local equilibration time ) processes and neglect any correlations .",
    "next , we apply the long - wavelength approximation assuming lattice constant @xmath2 to be much smaller than characteristic inhomogeneity length scales @xmath15 and @xmath16 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 components , respectively , @xmath17 . in the continuum limit ,",

    "equations describe smooth density profiles and can not be applied for length scales which are comparable with a lattice constant , @xmath21 , where short - range correlations become significant , as near percolation threshold , see @xcite .",
    "note that in the case where inhomogeneity length scales of two components drastically differ , say @xmath22 , higher orders of space derivatives should be taken into account in eqs .",

    "the main difference of eqs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) from the ordinary diffusion equation is a presence of mixing flux @xmath23 .",
    "this flux describes mutual drag of particles of one sort by particles of another one .",
    "it is caused by the two same reasons as a `` back correlations '' @xcite , mentioned above .",
    "the first one is a distinguishability of two different sorts of particles , e.g. , by spin or color .",
    "the second one is a local interaction ( repulsion ) between particles created by excluded volume constraint .",
    "the flows of gas components @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be represented as sums of diffusive and hydrodynamic parts .",
    "for example , for @xmath0-component , @xmath26 , the flow @xmath27 describes diffusion of @xmath0-particles through vacant sites , unoccupied by @xmath1-particles , with local diffusion coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "term @xmath29 may be associated with transfer of @xmath0-particles by some hydrodynamic flow with velocity @xmath30 , where concentration @xmath1 of another component plays a role of a velocity potential .",
    "@xmath31 can be analyzed along the same line .",
    "the drag of particles of one sort by particles of another sort directly follows from eqs .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "consider the particular case where characteristic inhomogeneity length scale of one component is much smaller than that of another component , say , @xmath22 . to a first approximation ,",
    "currents of both components are governed by a concentration gradient of the single component , @xmath32 , at least for a certain period of time : @xmath33.\\ ] ] the drag effect particularly means that mass transfer of @xmath0-particles can be directed along their concentration gradient , @xmath34 , i.e. , from region with low concentration to region with that of high one",
    ".    we will be interested in consequences of the drag effect in the limiting case where hoping rate of @xmath1-particles is negligibly small in comparison with @xmath0-ones , @xmath35 .",

    "equation of this type is often used for the description of a transport in various systems @xcite . in a compressible flow ,",
    "transport may exhibit intriguing effects as it is in the presence of stable foci ( traps ) of the flow @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the hydrodynamic flow , @xmath39 , is associated with a repulsion of mobile particles from the frozen component .",
    "thus , density relaxation of mobile particles is governed by both diffusive mechanism and their interaction with `` internal '' field @xmath32 .",
    "as it is well known , the advection - diffusion can exhibit anomalous behavior that manifests itself , in particular , in non - classical dependence of a root - mean - square displacement on time , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the exponent of anomalous diffusion @xcite . in the case of compressible flow",
    "considered here ( @xmath42 ) , the exponent @xmath43 may lose universality and may depend on the degree of compressibility .",
    "such anomalous phenomenon is not necessarily takes place asymptotically in the limit @xmath44 , but can occur , at least , on a time scale that is less than a finite mixing time @xcite . on this time scale ,",
    "density relaxation may strongly depend on initial state and demonstrate peculiar behavior .    in this section",
    "we show that mass transport from low density region towards a dense one in an inhomogeneous medium may locally accompany subdiffusive ( @xmath45 ) process .",
    "moreover , such integral characteristic as a root - mean - square displacement @xmath46 does not describe relaxation process properly . unlike in the case of ordinary diffusion , motion of packet front @xmath47",
    "does not coincide with a root - mean - square displacement time dependence and has phased behavior .    indeed , at relatively low values of gradient @xmath34 mass transfer is determined by the second term in right hand side of eq .",

    "<S> a mass transfer directed from low to high density region in an inhomogeneous medium is modeled as a limiting case of a two - component lattice gas with excluded volume constraint and one of the components fixed . in the long - wavelength approximation , </S>",
    "<S> density relaxation of mobile particles is governed by a diffusion process and interaction with a medium inhomogeneity represented by a static component distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that density relaxation can be locally accompanied by a density distribution compression . in quasi one - dimensional case , </S>",
    "<S> the compression dynamics manifests itself in a hopping - like motion of diffusing substance packet front position due to a staged passing through inhomogeneity barriers and leads to a fragmentation of a packet and retardation of its spreading . </S>",
    "<S> a root - mean - square displacement reflects only an averaged packet front dynamics and becomes unappropriate as a transport characteristic in this regime . in a stationary case mass transport throughout a whole system may be directed from a boundary with low concentration towards a boundary with that of high one . </S>",
    "<S> implications of the excluded volume constraint and particles distinguishability for these effects are discussed . </S>"
