    "at the end of the last millenium , the tevatron collaborations  @xcite came out with a bottom quark production cross section at @xmath2tev in excess of the theoretical prediction by about a factor of two . refined parton density functions and other theoretical improvements , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the b - quark fragmentation function , have recently been shown to account for the difference in the data recorded at @xmath3tev  @xcite .",
    "a more exotic model  @xcite , in which a pair of gluinos with mass 12 to 16@xmath1  is produced in  collisions , with subsequent decays into a bottom quark and a light sbottom , with mass below 6@xmath1 , has been shown to also fit the excess well . in this model",
    ", the sbottom must either be long - lived or decay _ via _ r - parity - violating coupling to light quarks , _ e.g. _ , @xmath4 , to comply with various experimental constraints .",
    "long - lived sbottoms have recently been excluded up to masses of 92@xmath1  by aleph  @xcite in direct searches for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , but r - parity - violating prompt hadronic decays have not been addressed by the aleph analysis .    a light , hadronically decaying sbottom would increase the @xmath0  hadron cross section above the @xmath7  production threshold by up to a quarter of the @xmath0  cross section , _",
    "i.e. , _ about 2% far from the z peak and 5% at the z peak .",
    "for this reason , the measurements of the hadronic cross section at centre - of - mass energies from 20 to 209gev ( _ i.e. _ , well above the known  resonances ) from pep  @xcite , petra  @xcite@xcite , tristan  @xcite@xcite and lep / slc  @xcite , are re - analysed in this letter to search for a possible consistent excess .",
    "this letter is organized as follows .",
    "a compilation of the data is presented in a synthetic manner in section  [ sec : data ] to allow easy re - interpretation in the future .",
    "the global fit of the data is described in section  [ sec : fits ] .",
    "the results of the analysis are given in section  [ sec : results ] and the conclusions are listed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "most of the data from pep , petran and tristan are published under the form of the ratio @xmath8 of the effective born hadronic cross section @xmath9 to the point - like @xmath10 cross section @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath14  centre - of - mass energy squared and @xmath15 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the latest topaz  @xcite and venus  @xcite publications report directly the value of @xmath9 instead . in both cases ,",
    "the latter includes a correction that unfolds the effects of initial state radiation ( isr ) , while still reflecting the running of the fine structure constant with the centre - of - mass energy  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 and @xmath9 data are listed in table  [ tab : petra ] ( pep , petra ) and in table  [ tab : tristan ] ( tristan ) , as obtained from a comparison of two recent compilations  @xcite and the original publications  @xcite@xcite . in these tables , only the final  and most accurate  result for each experiment and each centre - of - mass energy is reported .",
    "( superseded data are reported in both refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , but are not always clearly flagged as such therein . )    other refinements were considered in this letter for a rigorous statistical treatment of the data , and are described in the following .",
    "first , in each experiment , the systematic uncertainty was divided into a point - to - point contribution , @xmath16 , and an overall normalization error , @xmath17 , as is done in most of the orginal publications .",
    "the point - to - point systematic uncertainties are uncorrelated ( related to , _",
    "e.g. , _ the limited simulated statistics , or the statistical uncertainty on the measured luminosity ) , are assumed to have a gaussian probability density function and are taken directly from the original publications .",
    "in contrast , the overall normalization error definition varies among the publications , being either the largest possible variation interval ( _ e.g. , _ between several sets of selection criteria , different ways of determining the luminosity , or various quark fragmentation models ) or half this interval . here ,",
    "the definition was unified in such a way that the overall normalization can vary by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with a uniform probability over the whole interval .",
    "this overall normalization error is 100% correlated between the different centre - of - mass energy points reported in each given publication .",
    "third , the published values of @xmath17 often contain an estimate of the effect of missing higher - order qed corrections in the isr unfolding procedure , at the level of a couple of percent .",
    "indeed , at the time of pep , petra and tristan , the monte carlo programs used to simulate the @xmath20 and @xmath21 processes were limited to @xmath22 .",
    "the missing orders have a potential effect on the measured value of @xmath9 via the prediction of both the hadronic cross section and the bhabha scattering cross section : the former is used to correct the measured @xmath23 for qed effects , and the latter to determine the integrated luminosity .",
    "altogether , the published cross section values would have to be corrected as follows , @xmath24 where the indices ( 1 ) and ( all ) refer to the cross section prediction up to the qed first order ( used in the original publications ) and with all orders , respectively .    with the programs that have been developed for lep",
    ", it is now possible to evaluate this correction with a better accuracy than that assumed twenty years ago .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 cross sections were determined here with and without qed higher orders by zfitter  @xcite with an emulation of the kinematical cuts described in the original publications .",
    "it was found that the corrections to bhabha scattering and hadron production essentially cancel in the ratio of eq .",
    "the remaining contribution of qed higher orders is at the 0.1% level , almost independently of the event selection and the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the large uncertainties related to the missing qed higher orders were therefore taken out from the original values of @xmath17 . while the aforementioned 0.1% contribution could be simply corrected for in @xmath25 , a new normalization error @xmath26 was added instead ( assumed to be 100% correlated between all pep , petra and tristan measurements ) to conservatively account for the yet missing orders in zfitter .    finally , early tristan data  @xcite are also corrected in the original publications for other electroweak effects , dominated by the top quark contribution ( with a @xmath27 dependence at first order ) . these small corrections ( between @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath30gev , depending on the top quark mass chosen to determine the correction )",
    "were unfolded here _",
    "( i ) _ to have a consistent data set to work with ; and _ ( ii ) _ for a sound comparison with the zfitter prediction , which includes first- and higher - order electroweak contributions as well .",
    "the latest tristan data  @xcite were , more adequately , corrected for qed effects only .",
    "the electroweak effect correction needs therefore not be unfolded in that case .    for practical reasons ,",
    "the measurements of tables  [ tab : petra ] and  [ tab : tristan ] were clustered in few centre - of - mass bins as indicated by the horizontal separation lines in these two tables .",
    "the ratio @xmath8 values were averaged in each bin according to the total uncertainties , _",
    "i.e. _ , with a weight proportional to the inverse of @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding averaged born effective cross sections ( @xmath9 ) and centre - of - mass energy values are displayed in table  [ tab : average ] .",
