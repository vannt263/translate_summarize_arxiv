    "the structure of cocommutative connected bialgebras is well - understood in characteristic zero . by milnor - moore theorem @xcite such",
    "a bialgebra is the enveloping algebra of its primitive part , regarded as a lie algebra in a canonical way .",
    "this result is one of the most important ingredients in the proof of cartier - gabriel - kostant theorem @xcite , that characterizes cocommutative pointed bialgebras in characteristic zero as products  between enveloping algebras and group algebras .",
    "versions of milnor - moore theorem and cartier - gabriel - kostant theorem for graded bialgebras ( over @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) can be also found in the work of kostant , leray and milnor - moore . for other more recent results , analogous to milnor - moore theorem ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-graded bialgebras , nowadays called superbialgebras , appeared independently in the work of milnor - moore and maclane . from a modern point of view",
    ", superalgebras can be seen as bialgebras in a braided monoidal category .",
    "these structures play an increasing role not only in algebra ( classification of finite dimensional hopf algebras or theory of quantum groups ) , but also in other fields of mathematics ( algebraic topology , algebraic groups , lie algebras , etc . ) and physics . braided monoidal categories",
    "were formally defined by joyal and street in the seminal paper @xcite , while ( bi)algebras in a braided category were introduced in @xcite . by definition",
    ", @xmath6 is a bialgebra in a braided category @xmath7 if @xmath8 is an associative multiplication on @xmath1 with unit @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a coassociative comultiplication on @xmath1 with counit @xmath11 such that @xmath11 and @xmath10 are morphism of algebras where the multiplication on @xmath12 is defined via the braiding .",
    "in other words , the last property of @xmath10 rereads as follows @xmath13where @xmath14 denotes the braiding in @xmath15 the relation above had already appeared in a natural way in @xcite , where hopf algebras with a projection are characterized .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath1 be a hopf algebra and let @xmath16 be a morphism of hopf algebras such that @xmath17 . to these data , radford associates an ordinary hopf algebra @xmath18 and a hopf algebra @xmath19 in the braided category @xmath20 of yetter - drinfeld modules .",
    "then he shows that @xmath21 , where on @xmath22 one puts the tensor product algebra and tensor product coalgebra of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the category @xmath20 ( the braiding of @xmath20 is used to twist the elements of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "it is worth to notice that the above hopf algebra structure on @xmath22 can be constructed for an arbitrary hopf algebra @xmath25 in @xmath26 it is called the _ bosonization _ of @xmath23 and it is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "notably , the product  that appears in cartier - gabriel - kostant theorem is precisely the bosonization of an enveloping lie algebra , regarded as a bialgebra in the category of yetter - drinfeld modules over its coradical .",
    "the result of radford was extended for more general classes of bialgebras with a projection in @xcite .",
    "bosonization also plays a very important role in the lifting  method for the classification of finite dimensional pointed hopf algebras , introduced by n. andruskiewitsch and h.j .",
    "schneider . roughly speaking ,",
    "the lifting method requires two steps .",
    "if @xmath1 is a pointed hopf algebra , then @xmath28 , the graded associated of @xmath1 with respect to the coradical filtration , is a hopf algebra with projection onto the homogeneous component of degree @xmath29 hence , by radford s result , @xmath28 is the bosonization of a graded _ connected _ hopf algebra @xmath23 in @xmath30 , where @xmath24 is the coradical of @xmath1 . accordingly to the lifting method , first one has to classify all connected and graded hopf algebras @xmath23 in @xmath20 such that @xmath31 .",
    "then one has to find all hopf algebras @xmath1 such that @xmath32 , with @xmath23 as in the first step .",
    "therefore , in many cases , for proving a certain property of hopf algebras , it is enough to do it in the connected case .",
    "the price that one has to pay is that we have to work with hopf algebras in a braided category ( usually@xmath30 ) , and not with ordinary hopf algebras .",
    "motivated by this observation , in this paper we will investigate connected and cocommutative bialgebras in a braided category . actually nowadays people recognize that it is more appropriate to work with braided bialgebras , that were introduced in @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite and kharchenko- connected ) .    to define a braided bialgebra",
    "we first need a braided vector space , that is a pair @xmath33 , where @xmath1 is a vector space and @xmath34 is a solution of the braid equation ( [ ec : braid equation ] ) .",
    "then we need an algebra @xmath35 and a coalgebra @xmath36 which are compatible with the braiding ( see definitions [ def : braided algebra ] and [ def : braided coalgebra ] ) .",
    "now , for defining braided bialgebras , one can proceed as in the classical case ; see [ de : c - bialgebra ] .",
    "the prototype braided bialgebra is @xmath37 the tensor algebra of a braided @xmath38-vector space @xmath39 the braiding @xmath34 lifts uniquely to an operator @xmath40 .",
    "the usual algebra structure on @xmath41 is compatible with @xmath42 , so @xmath43 is an algebra ( for the multiplication , of course , we use @xmath42 and not the usual flip map ) . therefore , there is a unique coalgebra structure on @xmath44 , so that @xmath45 is included in the space of primitive elements of @xmath44 and the comultiplication is an algebra map .    for constructing other examples of braided bialgebras , we focus on the case when @xmath46 is a braided vector space such that @xmath34 is a braiding of hecke - type of mark @xmath47 , that is @xmath34 is a root of @xmath48 then , to every @xmath38-linear map @xmath49 which is compatible with @xmath50(i.e .",
    "a so called braided bracket , see definition [ ec : b compatibilitate ] ) we associate a new braided bialgebra @xmath51 called enveloping algebra , as follows .",
    "the set @xmath52contains only primitive elements in @xmath53 , so the ideal @xmath54 generated by @xmath55 in @xmath53 is a coideal too .",
    "hence the quotient @xmath56 of @xmath53 through @xmath54 is a braided bialgebra . as a particular case",
    "we obtain the braided symmetric algebra @xmath57 .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that the braided subspace @xmath58 of primitive elements of a connected braided bialgebra @xmath59 can always be endowed with a braided bracket @xmath60 whenever @xmath61 is a braiding of hecke - type . in this case",
    "one can consider the corresponding enveloping algebra ( see theorem ( [ pr : universalitate u ] ) ) .    the main result of the paper is theorem [ te : mm ] .",
    "it is a version of milnor - moore theorem for connected braided bialgebras that are infinitesimally cocommutative .",
    "in fact , we prove that , for a given field @xmath38 with @xmath62 , if @xmath1 is a connected braided bialgebra having a @xmath2-cocommutative infinitesimal braiding @xmath63 for some regular element @xmath3 in @xmath38 , then    * the infinitesimal braiding of @xmath1 is of hecke - type of mark @xmath2 and * @xmath1 is isomorphic as a braided bialgebra to the symmetric algebra @xmath64 of @xmath65 whenever @xmath66 .",
    "we point out that the case @xmath67 can be easily treated by means of kharchenko s results in @xcite ( see remark [ rem : mm ] ) .    to achieve our result we characterize bialgebras of type one with infinitesimal braiding of hecke type ( see theorem [ teo : aureo ] ) .",
    "moreover , for a given braided vector space @xmath46 of hecke - type of mark @xmath68 , we show that @xmath69 is the unique @xmath34-bracket on @xmath46 for which the @xmath38-linear canonical map @xmath70 is injective whenever @xmath71 ( see theorem [ te : lie algebras ] ) .",
    "throughout this paper @xmath38 will denote a field .",
    "all vector spaces will be defined over @xmath38 and the tensor product of two vector spaces will be denoted by @xmath72 .    in this section",
    "we define the main notion that we will deal with , namely braided bialgebras .",
    "we also introduce one of the basic examples , namely the tensor algebra of a braided vector space .",
