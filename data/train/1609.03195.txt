    "an empirical description of the milky way s present structure and formation history requires accurate and consistent age estimates for large samples of stars distributed throughout the galaxy .",
    "although we have recently entered an era of extensive spatial , kinematic , and chemical information beyond the solar neighborhood , comparably extensive age constraints remain elusive .",
    "stellar age is a property that must be inferred from observations with the help of stellar evolution models ; generally , it can not be measured  directly \" .",
    "therefore , results are inherently limited by the applicability and accuracy of the model used ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review . ) as stellar ages are difficult to measure directly , abundances such as  and  are commonly used as an age - dating proxy ( e.g. via making maps of mono - age populations ; see @xcite and @xcite ) because the determination of photospheric abundances from spectra is more straightforward .    unfortunately for milky way studies , the population of stars that is most readily observable throughout the galaxy  red giant stars",
    " is also the one for which it is particularly challenging to estimate ages .",
    "the standard technique of isochrone fitting is impractical in this regime , because there is too much uncertainty both in stellar parameter measurements and in the model isochrones . in other words , stars with very different ages",
    "can have very similar atmospheric parameters and luminosities @xcite .    instead , the key to age - dating red giant stars is mass . because the red giant phase is so short ,",
    "the age of a star is essentially its main sequence lifetime , which is set by the star s mass and metallicity @xcite . given mass and metallicity",
    ", one can estimate age using isochrones , e.g. by interpolating between them .",
    "recently , asteroseismology has made it possible to measure masses for giants out to large distances .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission @xcite has conducted long - cadence photometry for over ten thousand giants along a pencil - beam through the galaxy @xcite . from detailed light curves",
    "one can measure two characteristic variability frequencies that directly probe the ( age - dependent ) structure of the stellar interior : @xmath6 is the frequency corresponding to the maximum oscillation power , and @xmath7 is the frequency spacing between two consecutive modes of the same spherical degree .",
    "this approach is especially effective for giants because they have higher densities and thus a larger sound speed , which makes these ( acoustic ) oscillations more pronounced @xcite .",
    "together with a measurement of the star s , and the solar values @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the mass of the star can be estimated using seismic scaling relations .",
    "note that these scaling relations are based on sun - like stars , and may not be suitable for metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the population of stars with asteroseismic measurements is spatially limited .",
    "@xcite and @xcite greatly expanded the spatial coverage of giants with age estimates by determining masses spectroscopically : they showed that the masses ( and implied ages ) of post dredge - up giants can be measured from high - resolution infrared ( apogee , r@xmath1022,500 ) spectra , and determined a model of mass and age as a function of , , , , and  values ( see tables a2 and a3 in @xcite ) .",
    "their work increased the sample of giant stars with known ages to 70,000 , the largest ( and most spatially extended ) sample of stellar ages to date .    in this work , we set out to extend this spectroscopic mass & age work to lamost , the largest ongoing stellar spectroscopic survey .",
    "lamost  represents a large expansion over apogee  in area coverage ( lamost  stars are measured away from the disk , unlike apogee ) , sample size , and parameter range ( in particular , ) .",
    "@xcite have shown that basic parameters ( , , , and ) consistent with apogee  values can be determined directly from lamost  spectra , using _",
    "the  cannon_.    _ the  cannon _  @xcite is a data - driven method for measuring stellar  labels \" ( a term that refers collectively to all attributes of a star , e.g. physical parameters and element abundances ) from stellar spectra in the context of large spectroscopic surveys .",
    "it has shown promise for bringing qualitatively different stellar surveys onto a consistent physical scale , and for transferring label systems from one survey to another . in @xcite , for example , _ the  cannon _  was used to transfer labels from a high - resolution , high-  survey ( apogee ) to a low - resolution , modest-  survey ( lamost ) , enabling the measurement of the first - ever  values from lamost  spectra , and the largest and most spatially - extended sample of  values to date ( @xmath11450,000 giants ) .",
    "of course , this data - driven approach can only be applied to a subset of the lamost  dataset , restricted by the overlap in label space with apogee : because the set of objects in common between apogee  and lamost  is entirely giants , our model is limited in its applicability to giants , which is only 20% of the lamost  dr2 dataset .    _",
    "the  cannon _  operates in two s.png : a training step and a test step . for a complete description of the methodology ,",
    "see @xcite ; we summarize briefly here . in the training step , _ the  cannon _  uses a reference set of objects observed in common between the surveys of interest to construct a predictive model of spectra independently at each wavelength .",
    "for example , for a set of objects measured in common between survey a and survey b , _ the  cannon _  might fit a model that predicts every pixel in a survey a spectrum given survey b labels . in the test step , this model can be used to infer _ new _ labels directly from survey a spectra that are by construction on the survey b label scale . _ the  cannon _",
    "uses no explicit physical stellar models , is very fast , and achieves comparable accuracy to existing survey pipelines using significantly lower snr spectra ; it requires only a set of objects observed in common between the surveys .",
    "taken together , the work in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite raises the prospect that ages could be determined for a large sample of lamost  giants . in theory",
    ", it seems plausible that mass ( and implied age ) information could be encoded in optical spectra .",
    "after all , in the near - ir , mass is encoded in cn and co molecular regions ; as  and  features are prominent in the blue parts ( @xmath12 ) of giant spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) it seems plausible that this information could be encoded in lamost  spectra too .",
    "recent theoretical work by @xcite and @xcite lends physical justification to why these features should be indicative of mass : during a star s main sequence lifetime , the cno cycle in its core determines the final relative abundances of carbon and nitrogen . after arriving on the giant branch , the material in the core",
    "is dredged up to the surface via convective mixing .",
    "the depth of the convective envelope , and the  ratio in the core , is determined by the mass of the star .",
    "thus , in giants that have undergone dredge - up once ( that is , they have not undergone additional convective mixing ) the  ratio observed in the photosphere is ( together with metallicity ) highly predictive of mass",
    ".    however ,  and have not previously been measured from low - resolution resolution ( @xmath13 ) spectra . in this work , we extend the apogee - lamost  label transfer work of @xcite by two additional labels (  and ) to learn about the information content of lamost  spectra .",
    "we use the theoretical relations in @xcite to determine masses and ages for as many giant stars as possible , restricted primarily by the parameter regime in which the relations are applicable .",
    "this will enable us to measure the largest sample of stellar ages to date .",
    "our procedure for transferring labels from apogeeto lamost  using _ the  cannon _  closely resembles the work of @xcite . here , too , the data consist of spectra from lamost , which we again normalize in a consistent way using a running gaussian , and labels from apogee  dr12 . as before ,",
    "the spectral model is quadratic in the labels .",
    "there are , however , important differences in ( and new components to ) our modeling : in the labels that we use , in the reference objects that we use to train the model , in spectral regions that we mask out , and in the incorporation of photometry .    here ,",
    "our model is quadratic in seven labels instead of the original five labels : we use , , , , , , and k - band extinction . because we will eventually use the relations in @xcite to translate our carbon and nitrogen abundances into age estimates , our labels need to be on the same scale as those that were used to fit for the relations",
    "thus , whereas we used the calibrated dr12 parameters in @xcite ( those in the ` param ` array ) in this case we use the raw , uncalibrated values from the ` fparam ` array .",
    "furthermore , we do not use the full reference set of 9956 objects from @xcite , because some of these have unreliable  and reference labels .",
    "following @xcite , we excise objects that have both @xmath14 and @xmath15 $ } } < -0.5 $ ] ( 743 objects ) in order to eliminate objects with only an upper limit measurement on  and a lower limit on . in addition , @xcite found that the minimum  possible to measure is on the level of -0.4 to -0.5 dex , so we also exclude objects with @xmath16 $ } } < -0.4 $ ] ( 40 objects ) .",
    "this left us with 9173 out of the original 9956 .    in @xcite , we fit an independent spectral model at _ every _ spectral pixel . however , there are features in lamost  spectra that arise from effects in a different velocity system from that of the star : for example , diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) and the na i doublet are interstellar absorption features originating from intervening material .",
    "we noticed by examining the leading coefficients of an initial cannon model ( see figure [ fig : leading - coeffs ] ) that _ the  cannon _  was `` learning '' to use these features to predict labels intrinsic to the star , particularly , and that this introduced radial velocity - dependent systematic errors into the label estimates - enhanced stars have a different line - of - sight velocity distribution , velocity and  may well be correlated ] .",
    "the leading coefficients of an initial _",
    "the  cannon _  model also indicated that the imperfectly corrected telluric bands , originating in the earth s atmosphere , left small , but significant , velocity - dependent effects in the rest - frame spectra of the stars .    to prevent _ the  cannon _  from using these features spuriously , we masked them out by setting the inverse variances corresponding to these pixels to be zero . to be conservative ,",
    "roughly half of each spectrum was masked , but because the most important features for our labels of interest were preserved , this still improved our label estimates .    masking out the interstellar absorption features took out most of the spectral information on , which originated in the dib strength .",
    "but of course , many - band photometry of a star encodes a combination of its effective temperature and its reddening .",
    "we found that incorporating photometry not only enabled us to accurately and precisely predict  for our reference objects , but also to improve the precision of our estimate of , particularly for lower-  spectra .",
    "it also improved the precision of our estimate of , presumably because measurements of  and  are highly covariant for spectra of this resolution due to blending ( see e.g. ting et al .",
    "2016b ; submitted to ) .",
    "the scatter in  decreased by 70% in the lowest-  spectra , by 50% in spectra with @xmath17 , and by 25% in spectra with @xmath18 . for low-  spectra , the scatter in  and   improved by up to 20% , although for @xmath19 the difference was negligible .",
    "we incorporated photometry as follows : we took magnitudes ( and the associated uncertainties ) from eight bands , taken from apass dr9 @xcite , 2mass @xcite and wise @xcite : _ g , r , i , j , h , k , w1 _",
    "( 3.4@xmath20 m ) , _ w2 _",
    "( 4.6@xmath20 m ) . from these",
    ", we constructed seven colors : _ g - r _ , _ r - i _ , _ i - j _ , _ j - h _ , _ h - k _ , _ k - w1 _ , and _ w2-w1_. for each reference object , we added its seven colors as  pixels \" to its spectrum : the color as the  flux \" and the uncertainty as the  error bar . \"",
    "using colors restricted us to the set of reference objects with apass , 2mass & wise magnitudes : 8472 of the 9173 .",
    "we emphasize that _",
    "the  cannon _  builds a model of spectra but is agnostic to whether the value of a `` spectral pixel '' is a true flux value or simply another observed property of the star that is sensitive to the labels of interest .",
    "note , however , that our quadratic model is probably not sufficiently complex for the photometric data ; we would expect improvements for a model that is more complex at the photometric pixels relative to the spectroscopic pixels .      as in @xcite",
    ", we evaluate the accuracy and precision of our model using a  leave-@xmath21-out \" cross - validation test .",
    "we split the 8472 reference objects into eight groups , by assigning each one a random integer between 0 and 7 .",
    "we leave out each group in turn , and train a model on the remaining seven groups .",
    "we then apply that model to infer new labels for the group that was left out .",
    "we use the results of the cross - validation to determine which objects are appropriate reference objects for training the model : we excise objects whose difference from the training value is greater than four times the scatter in that label , leaving 8125  objects .",
    "we train the model on these 8125  objects and re - run the cross - validation .",
    "we also use the model to infer labels for the 347 objects excised from the training , in order to properly account for all of the objects in the following error analysis .    at the end of this process ,",
    "each of the 8472 objects has a new set of labels determined by _",
    "the  cannon _ , from a model that was _ not _ trained using that object .",
    "figure [ fig : cross - validation ] shows the comparison of these cannon - inferred `` test '' labels with the reference labels used in training , for high objects ; there is a significant decrease in scatter compared to the corresponding figure in @xcite ( fig .",
    "6 ) . for objects with @xmath18 ,",
    "the labels are consistent with the apogee  training values to within 53k in , 0.11dex in , 0.05dex in , 0.06dex in , 0.09dex in , 0.03dex in , and 0.04mag in .",
    "these are comparable to , or within , the stated aspcap  uncertainties @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : snr - test ] shows the scatter in different bins of  ( where  is the median value of formal across all pixels in the spectrum ) in all of the labels except for  ( which is primarily determined from the additional photometric pixels , not taken into account in determining the ) . by construction , as a result of this data - driven label transfer , there is significant improvement in agreement with the apogee  values over those from the lamost  pipeline .    .",
    "the low bias and scatter in  and  demonstrates that these abundances can in fact be measured from low resolution lamost  spectra . ]    , not the reported lamost error bar . ]      a key strength of _ the  cannon _  is the physical interpretability of the spectral model .",
    "an independent model is fit at every pixel of the spectrum , so each pixel has a set of model coefficients as well as a model scatter term .",
    "the leading ( linear ) coefficient in each label can be thought of as a proxy for how sensitive a particular spectral pixel is to that particular label ; thus , each label has a wavelength - dependent indicator of which spectral regions are most informative .",
    "each pixel also has a model scatter term ; this is the intrinsic variance in the model at that pixel , as distinct from the observational variance . in other words , it is the expected deviation from the model at that particular pixel , in the limit of a perfect measurement .",
    "these are shown in figure [ fig : leading - coeffs ] , in the part of the spectrum found by _",
    "the  cannon _  to be most predictive of labels ( the blue end , @xmath22 ) , together with the scatter in the model .",
    "these linear coefficients are the first derivative of the model at a set of fiducial stellar parameters ; in this case , we pivot the model around the mean value in each label across the training set :  = 4687k ,  = 2.83dex ,  = -0.19dex ,  = -0.01dex ,  = 0.10dex ,  = 0.09dex ,  = 0.09mag . to facilitate comparison ,",

    "the new labels in this work are  and , so we should demonstrate that _ the  cannon_measures these values from physically plausible spectral signatures .",
    "ting et al .",
    "2016b ( submitted to ) quantified how the precision with which various abundances ( including  and ) can be measured varies as a function of survey resolution .",
    "they showed that low - resolution ( @xmath29 ) spectra , such as those from lamost , have the same theoretically achievable uncertainties per stellar label as medium - resolution ( @xmath30 ) spectra , under the following assumptions : equal exposure time ( so that a low - resolution spectrum has higher  per resolution element ) , an equal number of detector pixels ( so that low - resolution spectra have more extensive wavelength coverage ) , and a constant sampling per resolution element . these predictions are based in part on gradient spectra calculated using kurucz models @xcite , which are assumed to be perfect .",
    "of course , this aspect does not pertain to data - driven models ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .    to make a direct comparison between the cannon model and theoretical predictions",
    ", we calculate gradient spectra and compare them to the gradient spectra calculated from kurucz models by @xcite .",
    "gradient spectra are a quantification of how much the flux at a given wavelength changes with changes to a given label : in other words , it characterizes the sensitivity or information content of each wavelength for a given label .",
    "following equation 2 in ting et al .",
    "2016b , gradient spectra are calculated as follows :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 represents a model spectrum across wavelengths @xmath33 , generated using a set of labels @xmath34 . a fractional change in a particular label @xmath35 results in a fractional change in the spectrum @xmath36 at each wavelength @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , to study sensitivity of a spectral region to a particular label , one changes the value in that label and calculates the fractional change in the flux in that region .",
    "we have two sets of model spectra : one from the cannon model as described in section [ sec : procedure ] , and one from the kurucz models , in both cases generated using labels for a solar metallicity k - giant ( = 4800 , = 3.5 ) .",
    "we use each of these models to calculate a gradient spectrum for  by varying  by 0.2dex , and a gradient spectrum for  by varying  by 0.2dex . for a more direct comparison ,",
    "we normalize the theoretical gradient spectra the same way as the lamost  spectra .    figure [ fig : cn - gradient ] shows the cannon model gradient spectra overlaid with the kurucz model gradient spectra from ting et al . 2016b , for the cn and ch molecular features in the wavelength range 4100 - 4400  ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the panel on the left shows the gradient spectra for carbon , and the panel on the right shows the gradient spectra for nitrogen . as the theoretical gradient spectra ( red ) were generated purely from physical models , and the cannon gradient spectra ( black ) represent an entirely data - driven relationship between these wavelength regions and abundances from apogee , the qualitative similarity between them is gratifying .",
    "there are clearly some quantitative differences , but we simply seek to demonstrate here that the signatures of carbon and nitrogen from the data - driven cannon model come from astrophysically sensible wavelength regions , such as the 4215  cn band .",
    "furthermore , the differences between the two panels demonstrates that we are measuring each element from distinct features , not simply correlations between the two ( e.g. the carbon - sensitive ch ( g ) band , not present in the nitrogen signature ) . the fact that  and",
    "share regions of sensitivity does not mean that they are degenerate ; they may be covariant , but can still be independently measured when fit for simultaneously ( see ting et al . 2016b , submitted ) .",
    "the qualitative similarity between the black and red lines demonstrates that the cannon measurements of  and  are coming from astrophysically sensible spectral regions , e.g. the 4215  cn band .",
    "furthermore , the difference between the left and right panels demonstrates that  and  are being measured independently , not just via correlations : for example , the nitrogen signature does not include any changes in the g ( ch ) band . ]",
    "to transform  and  to mass and age , we use the formulas characterized by the coefficients in table a2 and table a3 of @xcite , which are in turn based on asteroseismic mass measurements for stars with  and  measurements .",
    "these relations are only applicable within a certain range of label values , restricting the number of objects for which we can infer masses and ages via their  and .",
    "although we infer  and  for the full set of 454,180 test objects described in @xcite , we apply the following cuts ( following @xcite ) which leave 230,901  objects suitable for applying the formula .",

    "so for each object we take the standard deviation of its gaussian spread to be the scatter associated with that signal to noise bin .",
    "thus , each object has a distribution in mass and age .",
