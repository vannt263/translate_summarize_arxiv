    "during radiation treatment planning ( rtp ) high doses are delivered into very narrow areas .",
    "although techniques have evolved along the years and have been largely improved , radiation is still spread beyond the target . to constrain the risk of severe toxicity of critical brain structures , i.e.",
    "the organs at risk ( oars ) , volume measurements and localization of these structures are required . among available image modalities , magnetic resonance ( mr ) images",
    "are extensively used to segment most of the oars .",
    "nevertheless , manual delineation of brain structures could be prohibitively time - consuming , prone to error , operator dependent and a poorly reproducible process @xcite .",
    "thus , image segmentation has become a central part in the rtp , being often a limiting step of it .",
    "automatic segmentation algorithms are therefore highly recommended in order to surmount such disadvantages .",
    "there are , however , several technical difficulties that make of the task of automatic segmentation of oars from mr images in brain cancer patients still a challenging problem .",
    "there exist a number of atlas - based approaches that have already attempted to segment some oars and brain structures in patients undergoing radiotherapy @xcite .",
    "most of the available techniques need to combine ct and mr sequences to accomplish the task .",
    "because ct and mr images are not always acquired simultaneously , combining both sequences might incorporate an additional step into the chain , in which images from the same patient are aligned , prior to apply the segmentation algorithm .",
    "although atlas - based approaches have been reported to produce good results for most head structures @xcite , limited success has been achieved when segmenting organs near the optic region , such as the optic nerves , chiasm or the pituitary gland and stalk @xcite .",
    "these structures are particularly difficult to segment mainly due to lack of contrast in some regions , heterogeneities in the texture in some of them , complexity of shape and/or shape and location variability across patients .    as alternative to atlas - based methods , bekes et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a geometrical model - based segmentation technique .",
    "in addition to optic chiasm and nerves , the eyes and lenses were also included in the evaluation .",
    "whilst segmentation of eyes and lenses were satisfactory , segmentation of optic nerves and chiasm was below their expectations .",
    "repeatability and reproducibility of the automatic results made the method not being usable for rtp for these two challenging structures .",
    "on the other hand , success on segmenting the pituitary gland and stalk has been even more limited , with very few works having reported any result @xcite .    inspired by the recent success of deep learning in the fields of computer vision and medical imaging , we considered its use in the presented work as alternative to segment oars in the optic region .",
    "deep learning has revived during last years , and deep networks have already been used on mr brain images , with special focus on segmentation of tumor @xcite and some brain structures @xcite . with regards to segmentation of oars in brain cancer ,",
    "few attempts have been so far presented @xcite , where hippocampal segmentation was addressed . among all the deep learning approaches , convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) have demonstrated to be very powerful in in biomedical imaging . in these networks ,",
    "two or three - dimensional patches are commonly fed into the deep network . a hierarchical representation of the input data is then learned , decoding the important information contained on the data . by doing this ,",
    "a deep network is able to ensure discriminative power for the learned features .",
    "however , valuable information inherited from classical machine learning approaches to segment brain structures is not included into these convolutional architectures .",
    "this knowledge may come in the form of likelihood voxel values , voxel location , as well as textural information , for example , which are greatly useful to segment structures that share similar intensity properties .",
    "networks based on convolutional filters , i.e. cnn , perfectly suit to deal with data presenting a grid structured representation , such as 2d or 3d image patches .",
    "however , when input data composed by features not presenting a grid - based representation is employed , cnns might not represent the best solution . because we wish to employ arrays composed by concatenation of different features we consider the use of denoised auto encoders ( dae ) instead , which has demonstrated to be able to deal with such type of features arrays @xcite",
    "another reason for employing dae is because of the limited size of the number of training and labeled data . despite the different strategies to network weights initialization ,",
    "if not enough training is available there exist a high risk of overfitting .",
    "daes act as a pre - training step , obtaining an approximate initialization of the weights in an unsupervised fashion .",
    "thanks to this the network can be trained with such limited amount of data while avoiding overfitting .    in this paper",
    ", we present a classification system based on a deep learning technique to segment oars in the optic region . instead of using image patches , we use a pile of hand - crafted features as input of the network .",
    "in addition to features typically employed in machine learning approaches to segment brain structures @xcite , we propose the extension of the features vector to improve voxel characterization .",
    "the novel augmented enhanced features vector ( ae - fv ) incorporates more information about a voxel and its environment , such as contextual features , and first order statistics and spectral measures .",
    "this allows to successfully segment more complex structures , such as the optic nerves , for example .",
    "in addition , clinical evaluation of our automatic system involving manual segmentations from several experts is also assessed in our experiment .",
    "for most existing machine learning segmentation methods , the features vector for a voxel _ v _ is composed by : voxel intensities in an image patch centered at _ v _ , likelihood of _ v _ of belonging to a particular structure , and location of _ v _ @xcite .",
    "in addition to classical features , we incorporate gradient patch information , contextual features and first order statistics and spectral measures for each voxel _",
    "v_.      there are a number of features that have been successfully employed to segment some brain structures in machine learning based approaches , which are common in many approaches .",
    "image intensities are among these commonly employed features .",
    "intensities can be used either as a patch around the voxel under examination @xcite or as a set of voxels in a specific and meaningful direction @xcite . to complete the group of classical features , likelihood of a voxel _ v _ of belonging to a particular structure , and location of _ v _",
    "have been also largely employed @xcite .",
    "the term of augmented features , and the inclusion of gradient and contextual features into the features vector , was already introduced by @xcite . in their work ,",
    "gradient orientations of all the voxels on each patch were used . following their work , to describe relative relations between an image patch and its surroundings ,",
    "contextual features are used . for each voxel",
    "_ v _ , a number of regions around its surroundings are sampled , radiating from voxel _ v _ with equal degree intervals and at different radius . to obtain a continuous description of the context , intensity difference between the voxel _ v _ and a patch _",
    "p _ is defined :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the mean intensity of the patch _ p _ and @xmath2 is the intensity of the voxel _",
    "v_. in addition , a compact and binary context description is obtained by employing a descriptor known as brief @xcite :    @xmath3    then , for each patch , the contextual feature includes both the continuous and binary descriptor for all the neighbor regions sampled .",
    "texture analysis ( ta ) has proven to be a potentially valuable and versatile tool in neuro mr imaging @xcite .",
    "ta can be divided into several categories according to the means employed to evaluate the inter - relationships of the pixels .",
    "statistical methods are the most widely used in medical images . on these methods ,",
    "the spatial distribution of grey values is analyzed by computing local features at each point in the image , and deriving a set of statistics from the distributions of the local features .",
    "local features are defined by the combination of intensities at specific position relative to each point in image . in the literature ,",
    "the use of these features to characterize textures have been mainly employed for classification of images @xcite or for the characterization of healthy and pathological human cerebral tissues@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , their use as discriminant factor in the segmentation of critical structures in brain cancer has not been investigated yet .    to quantitatively describe the first order statistical features of an image patch _",
    ", the following image features obtained from the histogram were employed : mean , variance , skewness , kurtosis and entropy .",
    "the mean takes the average level of intensity of the patch _",
    "p _ , whereas the variance describes the variation of intensity around the mean .",
    "skewness is a measure of symmetry , or more precisely , the lack of symmetry .",
    "the skewness for a normal distribution is zero , and any symmetric data should have a skewness near zero .",
    "kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are peaked or flat relative to a normal distribution .",
    "that is , data sets with high kurtosis tend to have a distinct peak near the mean , decline rather rapidly , and have heavy tails .",
    "data sets with low kurtosis tend to have a flat top near the mean rather than a sharp peak",
    ". a uniform distribution would be the extreme case .",

    "each cross represents the correspondence between sensitivity and ( 1 - specificity ) of a single patient and its color indicates the setting employed .",
    "first , it can be observed that for the six configurations nearly all results lie on the left - top sub - space , which indicates contours would be considered acceptable for rtp .",
    "nevertheless , there are cases which should be taken into consideration .",
    "for example , some contours are inside the `` high risk '' area when segmenting pituitary gland and stalk , meaning that the oar may be spared but the ptv not covered .",
    "in addition , although contours provided by both svm configurations lie inside the `` acceptable '' area , they dangerously surround the `` poor '' region , where the oars are not spared .",

    "visual results show that svm based classifiers provided much larger contours than the ground truth .",
    "this was particularly noticeable in the contours from svm with classical features . in the case of the chiasm ,",
    "for example , svm configurations were not capable of distinguish between chiasm and pituitary stalk .",
    "contrary , classifiers based on sdae correctly classified the chiasm avoiding the neighboring region of the pituitary stalk .",

    "a deep learning - based classification scheme created by stacking denoising auto - encoders has been proposed in this work to segment organs at risk in the optic region in brain cancer .",
    "one of the main contributions of this paper is the incorporation of contextual , first order texture statistics and spectral features into the features vector as input of the deep network .",
    "segmentation accuracy is improved by including all this information into the classification process .",
    "this work is not pioneering on the use of a stack of dae ( sdae ) to segment oars in brain cancer . in @xcite ,",
    "a similar approach was proposed to segment the brainstem .",
    "nevertheless , this work presents some differences .",
    "first , we propose an approach that is not tailored to only one structure .",
    "furthermore , structures segmented in the presented experiment are more complex to segment .",
    "and third , the features set employed in @xcite is extended . on the other hand , clinical evaluation of our automatic system involving manual segmentations from several experts was also assessed in our experiment .",
    "we have explored in this paper whether it is plausible to use hand - crafted features to train a deep learning network to segment small oars in brain cancer .",
    "we have noticed that deep learning is recently becoming quite popular in the medical domain .",
    "although its application to medical imaging is being explored , features sets employed in most of ongoing works are very different from the set proposed in this work . to demonstrate that the union of contextual and textural features into an enhanced features array",
    "can improve the performance we investigated the impact on the segmentation of several sets of features . by adding any of these types of features to the classical features array ,",
    "an improvement was already noticeable . across the experiment we noticed that , while in some patients the use of augmented features achieved better results , in other patients the result was improved when using textural features instead .",
    "however , when combining both of them results were more homogeneous , which can be also observed in the standard deviation of results .",
    "although several attempts to segment some of these small structures have been presented , unsatisfactory results have been reported . among the four oars analyzed in the present study ,",
    "the optic nerves and chiasm have received the most attention . in various evaluations performed in rtp context , @xcite ,",
    "automatic segmentations were not sufficiently accurate to be usable in rtp .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented an atlas - based algorithm , which combined ct and mr images to segment optic nerves and chiasm , which achieved a mean dsc value just below 0.8 for both structures .",
    "nevertheless , a computation time close to 20 minutes was reported .",
    "although in terms of similarity the proposed approach is comparable to their work to segment the chiasm , important differences are two - fold .",
    "first , it does not require combination of image modalities .",
    "second , segmentation time is largely faster than proposed approaches . in another recent study on rtp context @xcite ,",
    "manual and automated approaches were compared to segment brain structures in the presence of space - occupying lesions . to achieve the automation of the segmentation process , a registration - driven atlas - based algorithm was employed .",
    "a set comprising the brainstem , eyes , optic chiasm and optic nerves was evaluated .",
    "main results disclosed in their evaluation showed that the analyzed automatic approach exhibited mean dsc values between 0.8 - 0.85 for larger structures .",
    "contrary , dsc reported for smaller structures , i.e. optic chiasm and optic nerves , were of 0.4 and 0.5 , respectively . regarding others structures , only @xcite included the pituitary gland on their evaluation , with no success at all . therefore and to the best of our knowledge , results suggest that the method proposed in this work is the most accurate , robust and fast method to date to accomplish automatic segmentation of optic nerves , optic chiasm , pituitary gland and pituitary stalk .    it is important to note that similarity metrics are very sensitive in small organs .",
    "differences in only few voxels can considerably increase or decrease comparison values .",
    "therefore , we consider that having obtained dsc values higher than 0.7 in small oars is very satisfactory , in addition with good values for the other metrics . even in the worst cases , where dsc was above 0.55 - 0.60 for all the organs analyzed , the automatic contours can be considered as a good approximation of the reference .",
    "as example , figure [ fig : bestworstonseg ] shows the best and worst segmentation for both left and right optic nerves .",
    "in the context of structure delineation for radiation therapy , there exist a trade - off between preservation of structures of interest , need to sufficient treat tumor , and the ability to accurately deliver dose . based on the results",
    ", we have demonstrated that the proposed approach can successfully address preservation of oars , while allowing the ptv to be irradiated .",
    "furthermore , segmentation is achieved in a fraction of time with respect to other presented approaches .",
    "we believe that its adoption in rtp might therefore facilitate the segmentation task .",
    "cccc + [ -2ex ]    results obtained with the incorporation of the proposed features into the features vector to feed the deep network suggest that we are going in the good direction . nevertheless , it is important to note that differences in data acquisition as well as differences in manual contours used as reference might compromise comparisons with other works .",
    "the lack of public datasets including the structures of interest makes also difficult comparison with other approaches .",
    "we have proposed a deep learning based classification system to segment small organs at risk of the optic region in brain cancer .",
    "in addition to classical features widely employed in machine learning to segment brain structures , we have incorporated contextual features and textural features , leading to an augmented and enhanced features vector ( ae - fv ) .",
    "experimental results have shown that the proposed scheme achieve satisfactory results in terms of segmentation accuracy and processing time , with respect to the reference contours .",
    "additionally , incorporation of proposed features yields to improvements on the segmentation with respect to classical features .",
    "this study has also shown how segmentation of some oars in brain cancer can benefit from the synergy between hand - crafted features and deep learning representation .",
