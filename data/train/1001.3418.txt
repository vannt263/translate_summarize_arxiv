    "the behavior of nature s fundamental couplings is a subject of much recent interest .",
    "there is ample experimental evidence showing that they run with energy , and many particle physics and cosmology models suggest that they should also roll with time .",
    "this explains why the european space agency ( esa ) and the european southern observatory ( eso ) now list varying fundamental constants among their key science drivers for the next generation of facilities .",
    "recent technological developments have for the first time provided us with tools to accurately test this hypothesis .",
    "two recent reviews @xcite discuss most of these developments .    in particular , there are controversial claims for time variations of the fine - structure constant @xmath0 @xcite and the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xmath3 @xcite at redshifts @xmath4 , as well as of possible spatial variations of the latter in the galaxy @xcite . while these have so far not been confirmed by independent analyses @xcite",
    ", their potential implications certainly warrant further study . in the present work we focus on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) as a means to probe the behavior of these couplings at redsifts @xmath5 , but we will also discuss the importance of constraints at much higher redshifts ( @xmath6 ) , coming from big bang nucleosynthesis .    typically , in any sensible theory where a coupling is rolling , one generically expects the others to do so as well , though possibly at fairly different rates .",
    "since the rolling is expected to be due to the same underlying mechanism ( the most natural of which will be a dynamical , fundamental scalar field ) , the rates of change of the various couplings will in fact be related in any given theory .    from an experimental point of view",
    ", one can either take the simplifying assumption that only the coupling one wants to constrain is varying while the others are constant , or try to constrain joint variations at the expense of a more complicated analysis . in the latter case",
    "one can either choose a particular set of such relations ( thereby constraining only a particular theory , though usually quite tightly ) or phenomenologically treat the different variations as independent ( thus obtaining model - independent but usually weaker constraints ) .",
    "in this work we will use the cmb to constrain possible variations of @xmath0 and newton s constant @xmath1 , assuming them to be related by a phenomenological parameter whose value will be different in various fundamental physics scenarios .    the importance of @xmath0 as a fundamental physics probe stems from the fact that it is ubiquitous in electromagnetic processes .",
    "in the past this has been extensively used to constrain the fine - structure constant @xcite .",
    "these studies yielded results consistent with no variation , but due to degeneracies with other cosmological parameters the accuracy is lower than that of low - redshift measurements : it is only with the latest available data that constraints stronger than the percent level have been obtained @xcite .",
    "speaking of variations of dimensional constants obviously has no physical significance : one can design any variation by defining appropriate units of length , time and energy .",
    "however , one is free to choose an arbitrary dimensionful unit as a standard and compare it with other quantities . if one assumes particle masses to be constant ( as we will do in this paper )",
    ", constraints on the gravitational constant @xmath1 are in fact constraining the dimensionless product of @xmath1 and the nucleon mass squared . with this caveat , constraints on a rolling @xmath1",
    "provide key information on the gravitational sector .",
    "somewhat paradoxically , @xmath1 was the first constant to be measured but is now the least well known , a result of the weakness of gravity .",
    "indeed , in the past two decades our knowledge of its value did nt substantially improve from the precision of @xmath7 reached in @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recent laboratory measurements ( see e.g. @xcite ) point towards an uncertainty at the level of @xmath9 , while other works claim an improved precisions below @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of the secular variation of the period of nonradial pulsations of the white dwarf g117-b15a ( @xcite ) has produced complementary constraints at @xmath11 level .",
    "on the other hand , as shown in @xcite a variation in the gravitational constant could also affect the cmb anisotropy spectra , with current bounds of the order of @xmath12 ( se e.g. @xcite ) and constraints at level of @xmath2 achievable with future cmb experiments as planck .",
    "the interesting point is that the cmb is an observable potentially sensitive to variations in _ both _ fundamental constants .",
    "it is therefore timely to perform a combined analysis of cmb data considering simultaneous variations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 in order to investigate the possible correlations and deviations from the standard values .",
    "specifically , we will consider that the variations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related by @xmath13 with @xmath14 a free parameter that can be positive or negative , but not much larger than unity in absolute value ( we will conservatively assume that @xmath15 ) . as an illustration of the range of values allowed in some representative models , kaluza - klein - type theories typically have @xmath16 , einstein - yang - mills",
    "has @xmath17 , and randall - sundrum type models have very small positive @xmath14s ( say @xmath18 ) .",
    "these examples are discussed in more detail in @xcite  note that all of them have @xmath19 .",
    "however , one can equally easily find models with @xmath20 : for example string theory dilaton - type models have @xmath21 @xcite , while the bsbm - brans - dicke model has @xmath22 exactly @xcite .    in the rest of the paper we briefly sketch out analysis pipeline in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] and present our results in sec .",
    "finally we will discuss the implications of our results and present some conclusions .",
    "we emphasize that the key assumption of the present analysis is that the particle masses are kept constant , and there are no changes to the strong sector .",
    "a more general analysis , without this assumption , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we allow for a possible variation in the fine structure constant and in the newton s constant during recombination using the method described in @xcite and @xcite , modifying the publicly available recfast ( @xcite ) routine in the camb ( @xcite ) cmb code . as in @xcite",
    "we consider variations in the newton s constant @xmath1 by introducing a new dimensionless parameter @xmath23 such that    @xmath24    while we constrain variations in the fine structure constant by considering the dimensionless parameter @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fine structure constant today .",
    "the analysis method we adopt is based on the publicly available markov chain monte carlo package ` cosmomc ` @xcite with a convergence diagnostics done through the gelman and rubin statistics .",
    "we sample the following ten - dimensional set of cosmological parameters , adopting flat priors on each of them : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the hubble constant @xmath29 , the scalar spectral index @xmath30 , the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath31 at @xmath32 mpc@xmath33 , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath34 and , finally , the variations in the fine structure constant @xmath25 and in the newton s constant @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions and we impose spatial flatness .    our basic data set is the five  year wmap data @xcite ( temperature and polarization ) with the routine for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team .",
    "in addition to the wmap data we also consider the following cmb datasets : acbar ( @xcite ) , quad ( @xcite ) and bicep ( @xcite ) , as well as the older datasets from boomerang ( @xcite ) and cbi ( @xcite ) .",
    "for all these experiments we marginalize over a possible contamination from sunyaev - zeldovich component , rescaling the wmap template at the corresponding experimental frequencies .    in what follows , we also combine the cmb data with the recent union catalog of supernovae type ia luminosity distances and with the improved constraint on the hubble constant of @xmath35 at @xmath36 c.l .. from the recent analysis of @xcite .",
    "constraints on @xmath23 and @xmath0 are also computed using standard bbn theoretical predictions as provided by the numerical code described in @xcite , which includes a full updating of all rates entering the nuclear chain based on the most recent experimental results on nuclear cross sections .",
    "the bbn predictions are compared with the experimental determinations of the @xmath37he mass fraction @xmath38 and d / h abundance ratio , as discussed in @xcite @xmath39",
    "in table [ tab : wdm ] we report the constraints on the @xmath40 and the @xmath23 parameters obtained from the cosmomc analysis , using the the different combinations of the datasets described in the previous section , and in figure [ plot1 ] we show the @xmath36 and @xmath41 c.l .",
    "constraints on the @xmath25 vs @xmath23 for the different datasets .",
    ".limits on @xmath25 and @xmath23 from cmb data only ( first row ) , from cmb+sn - ia ( second row ) , from cmb plus the hst prior on the hubble constant , @xmath42 ( third row ) , from cmb plus bbn ( fourth row ) and for simulated mock data for the planck experiment .",
    "we report errors at @xmath43 confidence level . [ cols=\"<,^,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the data therefore prefers a value of @xmath14 whose value is significantly larger than zero , and again we see that the hst prior has a very strong effect",
    ". taken at face value , this result would therefore strongly disfavor the models we mentioned in the introduction as having @xmath14 negative for @xmath44 in absolute value . in other words , if there are any variations at or around the percent level , then the variations of the two parameters must have the same sign .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that , due to the degeneracy between the two parameters , a future detection for a variation in @xmath0 could be on the contrary due to a variation in @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore important to pursue a combined search for variations in the two constants since their effect on the cmb anisotropy are very similar . in this respect",
    "we forecast the constraints achievable from the planck satellite mission by using the specifications described in @xcite , assuming a standard @xmath45-cdm model .",
    "these results are also presented in tables i and ii .",
    "as we can see , due to the @xmath0-@xmath1 degeneracy the bounds obtained by planck will be only marginally improved respect from current cmb data , as also shown in figure [ plot4 ] .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath41 c.l .",
    "constraints on the @xmath23 vs @xmath46 expected from the planck satellite alone ( blue ) compared with the constraints obtained from current cmb data ( red ) .",
    "the degeneracy between these two parameters does nt allow for significant improvements respect to current bounds.,width=272 ]    however , we again emphasize that these results were obtained on the assumption that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the only rolling couplings , while everything else is kept fixed .",
    "while some of the above models should be taken as toy models and have little to say about this assumption , there are certainly others where one does expect particle masses to vary . among other effects , this will lead to variations of @xmath3 which may again have an imprint on the cmb , so a full analysis needs to be done before any stronger statements can be made .",
    "one analysis along these lines has been recently carried out @xcite , but the simplifying assumptions made by the authors imply that it applies only to a specific class of models , so a general analysis is still missing .",
    "moreover , our analysis is made under the approximation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as constant in time and space .",
    "while the cmb constraints come mainly from recombination epoch and on scales larger than @xmath47 , it is possible that our constraints could vary when a more accurate evolution in time and space up to the current epoch is considered .",
    "if we assume that @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not vary from bbn to recombination we can combine the cmb results with a bbn analysis .",
    "( this is a reasonable assumption , since in many scalar - field based models the field is frozen during the radiation era . ) the results are plotted in figure @xmath48 and also reported in table 1 .",
    "as we can see a sort of cosmic complementarity is present between the two datasets and much stronger bounds can be achieved .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "differently than for the cmb , in the case of bbn in fact , variations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are negatively correlated , since both @xmath38 and deuterium are increasing functions of both parameters , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this implies that the likelihood contours for bbn and cmb are almost orthogonal in the @xmath49 plane , thus leading to a tighter bound , in particular on @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath41 c.l .",
    "constraints on the @xmath23 vs @xmath46 obtained from current cmb data ( blue ) compared with the constraints obtained from current cmb data plus bbn bounds ( red ) .",
    "a cosmic complementarity between those two datasets helps in breaking the degeneracy and a much stronger bound is achievable on @xmath23.,width=272 ]",
    "in this paper we have studied the effects of simultaneous variations of the fine - structure constant @xmath0 and newton s gravitational constant @xmath1 on the cmb .",
    "our results indicate that the current data gives no clear indication about the relative sign of the variations , but already prefers that any relative variations in @xmath0 should be of the same sign of @xmath1 for @xmath2 variations .",
    "we have also shown that , under the assumption that there s no rolling during the radiation era , much tighter constraints can be obtained by adding bbn data .",
    "while our analysis is more general ( and more robust ) than previous studies that have considered only the variation of one of these couplings , it is by no means the final word on the subject . as a convenient simplification",
    ", we have assumed all particle masses to be constant .",
    "this assumption is often made ( implicitly , if nothing else ) in varying @xmath1 studies since it gives an unambiguous meaning to its variations , but it is not a natural one . in particular , one expects that in any sensible model where there are @xmath0 variations , other quantities such as the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xmath3 will also vary .",
    "a more general analysis , allowing for this possibility , is obviously much more difficult to carry out in full generality , but nevertheless still feasible .",
    "one such analysis will be presented in a follow - up paper .    in any case",
    ", our results already show how fairly standard astrophysical observables can place strong constraints on high - energy physics models that would otherwise be difficult to test in laboratory or accelerator settings . with the significant gains in sensitivity expected for the next generation of ground and space experiments these constraints will become much stronger , and the early universe will become a key laboratory in which to probe fundamental physics .",
