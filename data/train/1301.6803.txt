    "extensive numerical simulations @xcite of the highly nonlinear classical field equations have revealed a very rich spectrum of solutions that are classified by their integer - valued hopf charge . for hopf charges up to 16 a variety of static , stable minimum - energy solutions with the structure of closed strings , twisted tori , linked loops , and knots have been identified .",

    "in analogy to the conventional @xmath2 skyrme model we use the collective coordinate method @xcite to construct hopf solitons of well - defined , nonzero isospin : we parametrize the isorotational zero modes of a hopf configuration by collective coordinates , which are then taken to be time dependent .",
    "this gives rise to additional dynamical terms in the hamiltonian , which can then be quantized following semiclassical quantization rules .",
    "a simplification that is often made in the literature @xcite is to apply a simple adiabatic approximation to the ( iso)rotational zero modes of the soliton by assuming that the soliton s shape is rotational frequency independent",
    ". the limitations of this rigid body approach were pointed out by several authors @xcite . in this paper",
    "we perform numerical computations of isospinning hopf solitons with hopf charges up to 8 in the full three - dimensional classical field theory without applying the rigid body approximation and without imposing symmetry constraints on the isospinning hopf configurations .",
    "it turns out that the skyrme - faddeev model with its rich topology of minimum - energy solutions , often of comparable energy , allows for `` transmutations '' when isospin is added and even for the formation of new , metastable hopf solutions .",

    "<S> we observe that the shape of isospinning hopf solitons can differ qualitatively from that of the static solution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the solution type of the lowest energy soliton can change . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results are of relevance for the quantization of the classical soliton solutions . </S>"
