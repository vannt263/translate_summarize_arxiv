    "a bipartite system @xmath0 can exhibit entanglement revivals even in the case in which the two subsystems are noninteracting and affected by local independent classical noise sources  @xcite .",
    "that is to say , entanglement can be a non - monotonic function of time , increasing in some time interval in spite of the lack of non - local operations or entanglement back transfer from a quantum environment  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is at first sight surprising , since we consider conditions under which entanglement , which is a non - local resource , can not be created .",
    "therefore the increase of entanglement must be attributed to the manifestation of quantum correlations that were already present in the system .",
    "the density operator formalism does not capture the presence of these quantum correlations , thus they are in some sense _",
    "hidden_. on the other hand , as we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the existence of such correlations is enlightened if the system is described as a physical ensemble of states . for this reason we introduced the concept of _ hidden entanglement _ ( he )  @xcite .",
    "the hidden entanglement @xmath1 is the amount of entanglement that can not be exploited at a given time @xmath2 , due to a lack of classical information on the system @xmath0 . as a result , at times",
    "@xmath3 this entanglement may be recovered without the help of any non - local operation .",
    "in other words , classical communication and/or local operations can succeed in increasing entanglement because they are not required to create any entanglement , which is impossible .",
    "they only remove that lack of knowledge which at time @xmath2 forbids us to dispose of the hidden amount of entanglement given by @xmath1 .",
    "relevant examples where the environment can be modeled as a classical system may be found in solid - state implementations of qubits , with the dynamics of such nanodevices dominated by low - frequency noise  @xcite .",
    "the recovery of quantum correlations in a classical environment was demonstrated in an all - optical experiment  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the relationship between recovery of he and information flow from a classical environment to the system , quantified by a decrease in time of their quantum mutual information .",
    "we show that such non - markovian behavior by itself does not guarantee entanglement recovery .",
    "it is also necessary that the ensemble physically underlying the system s mixed state includes entangled states , whose entanglement content can be recovered without nonlocal operations .",
    "let us start by considering a bipartite system @xmath0 whose dynamics is described by an ensemble of states @xmath4 .",
    "that is , we know the statistical distribution of the bipartite pure states @xmath5 , occurring with probabilities @xmath6 , so that @xmath7 , but the state of any individual system in the ensemble is unknown .",
    "the average entanglement of the ensemble @xmath8 is defined as  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the entropy of entanglement , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 reduced states of subsystems @xmath13 and @xmath14 . on the other hand , the entanglement@xcite of the state @xmath15 is quantified by some convex entanglement measurement @xmath16 ( reducing to the entropy of entanglement for pure states ) .",

    "( [ eq : meashiddenentang ] ) , it is clear that he is associated with the specific quantum ensemble description of the system state .",
    "we will refer to situations where the system dynamics _ admits a single physical decomposition in terms of an ensemble of pure state evolutions_. this is always possible , at least in principle , when the system is affected by _",
    "classical noise sources _  @xcite . in the case",
    "in which the system interacts with a quantum environment , a physical description of the system in terms of quantum ensemble it is still possible , when the environment is subjected to a projective measurement  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath19 is obtained after averaging over the measurement records and the hidden entanglement can be recovered by purely local operations acting on subsystems @xmath13 and @xmath14 , provided the classical record comprising information read from the environment is accessible .    since hidden entanglement recovery requires a back - flow of classical information from the environment to the system , it is interesting to compare he with the system - environment quantum mutual information and to discuss entanglement revivals in the context of non - markovian environments  @xcite . for this purpose , we embed the randomness present in the quantum ensemble @xmath4 into the degrees of freedom of a dummy quantum system @xmath20  @xcite , in the following way : @xmath21,\\\\ & & \\rho^\\textsf{se}(t)=\\sum_i p_i(t){\\vert { x_i(t ) } \\rangle \\langle{x_i(t)}\\vert }   \\otimes |\\psi_i(t)\\rangle\\langle\\psi_i(t)| ,    \\label{eq : rho_in_ehs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is an orthonormal basis for at time @xmath2 . from ( [ eq : rho_in_ehs ] )",

    ", we obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the shannon entropy associated with the probability distribution @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the loss of knowledge on the system , and the resulting uncertainty on the system state @xmath30 , can be interpreted as due to a flux of information  @xcite between @xmath0 and @xmath20 , the total amount of information shared between system and environment being quantified by the quantum mutual information  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the similarities and differences between he and quantum mutual information in the example of entanglement revivals under random local fields that we have studied in ref .",
    "let us first consider a two - qubit system @xmath31 initially prepared in the maximally entangled bell state @xmath32 .",
    "the time evolution consists of local unitaries , but we have no complete information about which local unitary is acting . in particular , we suppose that qubit @xmath13 undergoes , with equal probability , a rotation about the @xmath33-axis of its bloch sphere , @xmath34 , or a rotation around the @xmath35-axis , @xmath36 , while qubit @xmath14 remains unchanged . hence , the ensemble @xmath37 at time @xmath2 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "since we are dealing with random local unitaries , the average entanglement of @xmath37 is constant in time , @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath52 $ ] the entanglement revives from zero to one without the action of any nonlocal quantum operation , thus apparently violating the monotonicity axiom .",
    "the ensemble description tells us that at time @xmath53 the system is always in an entangled state ( @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) , but the lack of knowledge about which local operation the system underwent prevents us from distilling any entanglement : entanglement is _ hidden _ , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . at time @xmath58 this lack of knowledge is irrelevant since the two possible time evolutions result in the identity operation @xmath59 and entanglement is recovered , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .     for the system described by the quantum ensemble @xmath8 of eq .",

    "this similarity has a simple explanation : we have an ensemble @xmath8 of maximally entangled states , so that the lack of knowledge about which state of the mixture we are dealing with is the only reason that prevents us from exploiting entanglement as a resource .",
    "such lack of knowledge is correctly captured by the von neumann entropy .",
    "let us now consider the same quantum operation described at the beginning of this section , but starting from a different initial state , in general mixed : @xmath65 that is , the system is prepared in the maximally entangled state @xmath66 with probability @xmath67 , or in one of the separable states @xmath68 and @xmath69 , with equal probability @xmath70 , and the preparation record is disregarded or not available . in this case the quantum ensemble at time @xmath2 is @xmath71 the density operator which arises from such ensemble is @xmath72 .",
