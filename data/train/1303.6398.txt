    "the low lying spectroscopy of nuclei , from both decay as well as in beam measurements  @xcite , has drawn considerable attention in recent years .",
    "such measurements for the odd - odd transitional nuclei in a @xmath11 140 region are crucial in understanding the role of neutron proton interaction in the n , z = 50 - 82 subshell space .",
    "the nuclei in the vicinity of the magic n = 82 and semi - magic z = 64 exhibit excitations due to multiparticle - hole as well as quasi - vibrational structures .",
    "the coupling of valence particles to the core phonon gives rise to complex ( multi-)particle phonon level families in these nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the particle ( hole ) interactions and the resulting competition of the single particle with the underlying collective excitations have been rigorously explored through a number of experimental and theoretical investigations  @xcite .",
    "+ although the low lying levels in this mass region have been studied from decay and in - beam experiments with light ion beams , the information on level lifetimes and transition moments has been very rare in most of the cases .",
    "moreover , these studies have been performed mostly with either nai(tl ) or baf@xmath12 scintillators and intrinsic ge(li ) detectors with limited time resolution .",
    "thus , it is important to undertake systematic measurements on lifetime and transition moments for many of these nuclei .",
    "the measurement of lifetimes of the order of several ones or tens of picoseconds requires a detection system having a very good time resolution as well as a modest energy resolution . the precise technique for the measurements of level lifetimes of the order of few picoseconds has been a topic of research for many years  @xcite .",
    "with the availability of efficient inorganic scintillators , such as , labr@xmath9(ce ) , such measurements have taken a new direction  @xcite .",
    "+ the odd - odd @xmath0eu , with one extra neutron outside n = 82 shell closure is a topic of interest in order to test the persistence of subshell closure at z = 64  @xcite . the structure of @xmath0eu has been studied both from decay as well as in - beam reaction experiments  @xcite .",
    "the decay measurements have been carried out by different groups  @xcite in order to develop the excited levels as well as to obtain their lifetimes . of these , r. kantus et al .",
    "@xcite have performed coincidence measurements with a ge(li ) and a gam - x detector and developed a decay scheme up to 690.7 kev excitation . however , according to the latest compilation in nuclear data sheets  @xcite , the different measurements on @xmath0gd ec decay exhibit a lot of discrepancy in the observed levels , the energy and the intensity of the decay @xmath2 rays .",
    "the suggested sequence of the low lying states has been accounted for by combining a d@xmath13 proton hole and a f@xmath14 neutron particle following the jj coupling scheme of odd - odd nuclei .",
    "the prompt decay of 9@xmath15 , 235 @xmath16s isomeric state of @xmath0eu has been rigorously studied by ercan et al .",
    "the lifetime of the first 3@xmath8 and 2@xmath8 states has been measured by l. holmberg et al .",
    "@xcite by using electron - electron coincidence measurement with a magnetic @xmath17 spectrometer where they could only provide the limits of the lifetime values as @xmath180.16ns and @xmath180.2ns for the two states respectively .",
    "however , the sequence of 114 and 115 kev @xmath2 transitions has been modified afterwards by kantus et al .",
    "@xcite . also , there exists a large variance ( 0.16 ns to 0.8 ns ) in the measured lifetime of the 3@xmath8 state  @xcite .",
    "besides , the lifetime of the above two excited states seems to be quite large considering the suggested configuration of these states .",
    "+ in the present work , we have reported the low lying level scheme of odd - odd @xmath0eu nucleus from the ec decay of 48d @xmath0gd .",
    "the decay scheme of @xmath0gd has been modified considerably following the measurements of @xmath2 ray singles , @xmath7 coincidences and the decay half lives using high resolution ge detectors .",
    "the lifetime of the first 3@xmath8 and 2@xmath8 states have been measured with labr@xmath9 ( ce ) detectors by employing the mirror symmetric centroid difference ( mscd ) method  @xcite .",
    "a shell model calculation has also been performed using oxbash code  @xcite in order to interpret the experimental results .",
    "the excited states of @xmath0eu have been populated from the ec decay of @xmath0gd ( t@xmath19 = 48 days ) , produced via @xmath6sm ( @xmath3 , 2n ) reaction with 32 mev alpha beam from k=130 avf cyclotron at variable energy cyclotron centre , kolkata .",
    "the @xmath6sm targets with a thickness of 300 @xmath16g/@xmath20 were prepared on 6.84 mg/@xmath20 al foils by electro - deposition method using 93.8@xmath5 enriched sm@xmath12o@xmath9 .",
    "the enriched sample contained @xmath21sm ( 2.06@xmath5 ) , @xmath22sm ( 1.00@xmath5 ) , @xmath23sm ( 0.95@xmath5 ) , @xmath24sm ( 0.41@xmath5 ) , @xmath25sm ( 1.05@xmath5 ) and @xmath26sm ( 0.73@xmath5 ) isotopes as impurity .",
    "the theoretical cross sections for different nuclei produced in the reaction were estimated by using the code paceiv  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0gd nuclei produced from the above reaction were recoil - implanted on al catcher foils ( 6.84 mg/@xmath20 ) for the subsequent measurements .",
    "the al catcher foils containing @xmath0gd activity were dissolved in acid solution which was subsequently used for @xmath7 coincidence and lifetime measurements .",
    "the irradiated target was counted on a 50@xmath5 hpge detector for the measurements of @xmath2 singles and decay half lives . in this measurement , the target",
    "was kept at a distance of 15 cm from the detector to ensure a dead time less than 10@xmath5 and hence to minimise the summing effect .",
    "a canberra digital system was used for biasing , pulse processing and data collection of the 50@xmath5 hpge detector .",
    "the @xmath2@xmath2 coincidence data were acquired with a setup ( called as ` ge - setup ' later on in this paper ) consisting of one 10@xmath5 single hpge detector and a segmented low energy photon spectrometer ( leps ) , kept at an angle of 180@xmath27 with respect to each other . another setup ( called as ` labr@xmath9-setup ' later on in this paper ) consisting of two 30 mm x 30 mm labr@xmath9 ( ce ) detectors was used for the measurement of lifetimes . in this setup ,",
    "one detector was used as ` start ' detector and the other detector , kept at 180@xmath28 with respect to the ` start ' detector , was used as the ` stop ' detector .",
    "time to amplitude ( tac ) signal was generated from these two detectors for the subsequent measurements . in both the coincidence setups , used for @xmath7 coincidence ( ge - setup ) and lifetime measurements ( labr@xmath9-setup ) ,",
    "8k adc and camac based data acquisition system were used for collecting the zero suppressed list mode data with lamps  @xcite software .",
    "the absolute efficiency of all the hpge and leps detectors were determined by using calibrated @xmath25eu and @xmath29ba sources .",
    "the data analysis has been performed for the measurements of ( i ) decay half lives with the 50@xmath5 hpge detector , ( ii ) @xmath7 coincidence using ge - setup and ( iii ) lifetime using labr@xmath9-setup .",
    "the detailed procedures have been discussed in the following subsections along with the obtained results .",
    "the singles @xmath2 spectra acquired with the 50@xmath5 hpge detector , for a duration of 48h in each run and at definite time intervals , have been studied for the assignment of @xmath2 rays in the level scheme of @xmath0eu .",
    "the counting was performed after allowing a significant cooling time in order to exclude the contribution from the short - lived activities in the decay spectrum .",
    "all the @xmath2 rays observed in the total spectrum are shown in fig .",
    "[ total - decay ] and the @xmath2 rays , relevant to the level scheme of @xmath0eu , were studied for the decay half lives .",
    "these data were also used for the measurement of energy and intensity of the transitions .",
    "the @xmath2 rays observed in the total spectrum can be classified in four categories , viz . ,",
    "( i ) the @xmath2 rays from the decay of @xmath0gd ( 48d ) , ( ii ) @xmath2 rays produced from the decay of @xmath0eu ( 5d ) , ( iii ) @xmath2 rays from the decay of @xmath21eu(24d ) and @xmath23gd ( 9.4d ) produced in the reaction and ( iv ) the background and few unidentified @xmath2 rays .",
    "the @xmath2 rays of latter three categories were not considered in the present work .",
    "the decay plots for the relevant @xmath2 rays are shown in fig .",
    "[ decay - all ] .",
    "0.5 cm -2.0 cm -2.0 cm    -0.02 cm -0.8 cm -1.4 cm    the coincidence information has been derived from the data taken with the ge - setup using @xmath0gd activity in acid solution as discussed in section  [ expt ] .",
    "the gates were placed on 114.06 , 114.88 , 153.86 , 267.02 and 268.96 kev transitions in the spectrum of leps detector ( shown in fig .",

    "it is observed that 114.06 kev and 114.88 kev transitions are in coincidence with one another and also in coincidence with the 153.86 kev transition .",
    "the 229.4 kev transition is observed only in the gate of 153.86 kev but not in the gates of 114.06 and 114.88 kev transitions .",
    "the 268.96-kev transition has been observed only in the gate of 114.06 kev but not in 114.88 and 153.86 kev gates .",
    "the overlapped spectra of 267.06 and 268.96 kev transitions show that only 114.06 kev is present in the 268.96 kev gate whereas both the 114.06 and 114.88 kev transitions are present in the 267.06 kev gate .",
    "the aforesaid observation is also supported with the fact that the fwhm value for the peak obtained in the 267.06 kev gate is higher than that obtained in 268.96 kev gate . from these observations ,",
    "the placements of the 114.06 , 114.88 , 153.86 and 267.06 kev gamma rays were confirmed .",
    "the measured half lives of 229.4 and 268.86 kev transitions in the present work rule out the possibility of these two transitions to be originated from the summing effect . hence , the 229.4 kev and 268.86 kev transitions were included parallel to the 114.06 - 114.88 kev and 114.88 - 153.86 kev cascades respectively , as evident from their coincidence data and decay half lives explained above .",
    "the 420.88 and 575.24 kev @xmath2 rays were observed in the singles data and their half lives confirm their placement in the level scheme . there was no indication of the 76 kev and 383 kev @xmath2 rays , either in the coincidence data or in the singles data , and hence these two transitions were not placed in the present level scheme .",
    "the 84.01 , 276.57 and 627.35 kev gamma rays have been observed in the singles data of the present work and show the half lives of @xmath1148d .",
    "the first two transitions , viz .",
    "84.01 and 276.57 kev , are reported to be produced from the decay of the 235 @xmath16s isomer as well as from the heavy ion fusion evaporation work  @xcite .",
    "again these two @xmath2 rays are reported to be present in the 14 - 276 - 84 - 276 kev cascade according to the adopted level scheme of the nucleus . between the two placements of the 276 kev transition , as decided by the above cascade , the one feeding the 84 kev @xmath2 ray is reported to be decaying from the 647.5 kev level . however , the strongest transition decaying from this 647.5 kev level is 358 kev which was not found to exist in our data .",
    "hence , the second 276 kev transition is not originated from the ec decay of @xmath0gd and is not considered in the present decay scheme .",
    "again , the calculated intensity of the 627.35 kev transition comes out to be equal to that of 276.57 kev transition .",
    "this observation suggests that the 627.35 kev transition is the one which is reported as 624.5 kev  @xcite decaying from the 914 kev level ( modified as 918.5 kev level in the present work ) .",
    "hence , it is concluded that the 918.5 kev level is produced from the ec decay of @xmath0gd and then feeds the 14.57 - 276.57 - 627.35 kev cascade . a very high value of intensity ( @xmath11 12@xmath5 ) for the 84.01 kev transition does not support it to be feeding the 276 kev @xmath2 ray which subsequently feeds the 14 kev level .",
    "this observation , along with the similar intensity of 627.35 and 276.57 kev transitions as explained above , does not incorporate the 84.01 kev transition in the decay scheme . based on all these information ,",
    "the decay scheme of @xmath0gd has been modified considerably and shown in fig .",
    "-1.0 cm -6.0 cm -4.5 cm    the energy and absolute intensity of the @xmath2 rays belonging to @xmath0eu have been calculated from the singles measurement with 50@xmath5 hpge detector and indicated in table  [ levelscheme ] .",
    "while calculating the intensities , it has been considered that the intensities of the 14.57 , 114.06 , 229.4 and 420.88 kev transitions , feeding the ground state of @xmath0eu , add up to 100@xmath5 .",
    "due to the fact that the 114.06 and 114.88 kev peaks could not be separated , the combined intensity of these two transitions was calculated from the total area obtained in the singles data .",
    "this total intensity has been distributed among these two energies according to the following equations by considering that no direct ec decay is feeding the 114.06 kev level . @xmath30 and @xmath31 the ratio of intensity for 114.06 kev to that for 114.88 kev transition has also been verified from the total spectrum obtained in one segment of the leps detector as the two peaks could be separated with this detector .",
    "the intensity of the 14.57 kev transition has been considered to be equal to that of 627.35 kev as discussed above .",
    "however , the intensity of this transition is much smaller than that of 114.06 kev and lies within the error limit .",
    "the normalised intensities have been used in order to develop the decay scheme of @xmath0gd ground state to different levels of @xmath0eu as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - levelscheme ] .",
    "the logft values have been calculated from the logft calculator of nndc  @xcite for different ec decays and are shown in table  [ levelscheme ] .",
    "these values are in accordance with the existing assignment of j@xmath32 values for the states populated in @xmath0gd decay .",
    "the spin parity of all the states was thus kept unchanged with respect to the adopted decay scheme  @xcite except the 918.5 kev level which has been assigned to a j@xmath32 value of 2@xmath8 .",
    "the obtained half lives , relevant to identify the @xmath2 rays involved in the decay of @xmath0gd , are also shown in the same table  [ levelscheme ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ shmod ]",
    "the decay spectroscopy of @xmath0gd nucleus has been performed using the light ion beams from variable energy cyclotron centre to study the low lying structure of the odd odd @xmath0eu nucleus .",
    "the low lying excited levels of this nucleus have been considerably modified from the singles decay and @xmath2@xmath2 coincidence measurements .",
    "the present study assigns new levels in the decay of @xmath0gd and confirms two crossover transitions of 229.4 and 268.96 kev in the level scheme of @xmath0eu .",
    "the lifetimes of the first 3@xmath8 and 2@xmath8 levels of @xmath0eu have been measured to be 5.38 @xmath10 2.36 and 8.38 @xmath10 2.19 ps respectively following the mirror symmetric centroid difference technique using labr@xmath9(ce ) detectors . till date",
    "the literature values for the lifetimes of these two states provide only the limits while the present study assigns definite lifetime values with an acceptable error .",
    "a shell model calculation has been performed using oxbash code considering @xmath33sn as a core nucleus .",
    "the theoretical calculation agrees remarkably well with the experimental data .",
