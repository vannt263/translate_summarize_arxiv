    "the flavour structure of the quark sector is very well described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix , which is the only source of quark flavour violation ( qfv ) in the standard model ( sm ) . in particular , flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes , such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 etc . , are strongly suppressed  @xcite .",

    "we study the qfv gluino decays in the general mssm assuming that all squarks are heavier than the gluino , so that the gluino dominantly decays into three particles .",
