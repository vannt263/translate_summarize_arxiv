    "the study of star clusters is important for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "individual clusters , which encapsulate at least a partial history of the parent galaxy s evolution , can provide a unique laboratory for studying the ongoing and past star formation in the parent galaxy , since significant star cluster formation is typically produced by major star - forming episodes in a galaxy .",
    "m31 ( ngc 224 ) , the largest galaxy in the local group , is located at a distance of @xmath3 kpc from us ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it is so near and has a great number of star clusters that m31 offers us an excellent environment for detailed , more accurate investigations of a star cluster system .",
    "@xcite did the pioneering work of m31 star clusters , in which he presented photographic magnitudes for 140 globular cluster ( gc ) candidates .",
    "then , a number of catalogs of m31 gc candidates were published .",
    "later , a large survey of @xcite presented discoveries of many new gcs well out in the m31 halo , and these authors also completely collected and revised all previous lists of gc candidates .",
    "their final catalog includes 355 gc candidates based on a uniform selection scale .",
    "another three large surveys of m31 gc candidates were performed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic study of m31 gcs was begun by @xcite , followed by a significant number of authors .",
    "of which four large spectroscopic studies were given by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the first comprehensive catalog including photometric and spectroscopic data for m31 gcs was assembled by @xcite , who originally constructed a single master catalog incorporating the photometric and spectroscopic data in all of the individual catalogs before 2000 including their new photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "this catalog contains 435 clusters and cluster candidates .",
    "based on this master catalog , these authors firstly presented the integrated photometric and spectroscopic properties of the globular cluster system of m31 .",
    "the revised bologna catalog ( rbc ) of m31 gcs was published by @xcite and since then it has been revised including all of the newest published important data .",
    "rbc is the most extensive and commonly used .",
    "@xcite presented a new catalog containing 670 likely star clusters in m31 , all with updated high - quality coordinates accurate to @xmath4 , based on the images from either the local group galaxies survey ( hereafter lggs ) @xcite or the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "these authors derived high - quality spectra for @xmath5 star clusters and star cluster candidates in m31 taken with the hectospec spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt .",
    "based on the archival _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images , and images from the lggs , and the spectra they observed , these authors confirmed cluster classifications .",
    "in addition , @xcite distinguished m31 s young clusters from old , and estimated ages , reddening values , and masses for 140 young clusters by comparing the observed spectra with the simple stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "subsequently , @xcite determined the mean metallicities , ages and reddening values for 323 m31 old star clusters , and presented some properties of them such as the metallicity distribution .",
    "@xcite determined photometry in 15 intermediate - band filters of the batc system for 135 young star clusters in m31 from @xcite and @xcite , and estimated their ages and masses by comparing their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with ssp models , and presented integrated properties for these young star clusters .",
    "the distance modulus was taken to be @xmath6 throughout as @xcite adopted .    in this paper",
    ", we perform aperture photometry in 15 intermediate - band filters of the batc system for 304 old star clusters in m31 from @xcite . by comparing the observed multicolor photometry with the ssp models ,",
    "we derive their masses .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the sample star clusters and presents the batc observations . in section 3",
    ", we estimate masses of the sample clusters .",
    "lastly , our discussions and conclusions are presented in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "the sample of star clusters in this paper is from @xcite , who determined the mean metallicities , ages and reddening values for 323 old star clusters in m31 based on the spectroscopic data obtained with the hectospec fiber positioner and spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt . except for five star clusters , all the other sample clusters",
    "were observed with 15 intermediate - band filters of the batc photometric system .",
    "however , there are 13 clusters for which we can not present their accurate photometry with different following reasons : ( 1 ) some clusters are very close to other objects , ( 2 ) some clusters are very faint and the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is low , ( 3 ) some clusters are superimposed onto a very uneven background . in addition , b065-g126 falls in the bleeding ccd column of a saturated star , of which we can not present its photometry .",
    "thus , we will perform photometry for the remaining 304 clusters in the batc photometric system .",
    "the m31 field is part of a galaxy calibration program of the batc multicolor sky survey .",
    "the batc program uses the 60/90 cm schmidt telescope at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatories , chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) .",
    "this system includes 15 intermediate - band filters , covering a range of wavelength from 3000 to 10000   ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . before february 2006 , a ford aerospace @xmath7 thick ccd camera was applied , which has a pixel size of 15 @xmath8 and a field of view of @xmath9 , resulting in a resolution of @xmath10 .",
    "after february 2006 , a new @xmath11 ccd with a pixel size of 12 @xmath12 m was used with a resolution of @xmath13 pixel@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we obtained 143.9 hours of imaging of the m31 field covering about 6 square degrees , consisting of 447 images , through the set of 15 filters in five observing runs from 1995 to 2008 , spanning 13 years ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the spatial distribution of 304 sample clusters ( black dots ) and the m31 fields observed with the batc multicolor system , in which a box only indicates a field view of @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath15 of the thick ccd camera .",
    "we performed aperture photometry of 304 sample clusters found in the batc images in all of the 15 intermediate - band filters to provide a comprehensive and homogeneous photometric catalog for them . of which photometry of 55 star clusters is first obtained .",
    "we want to point out that , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite had presented photometry for 249 sample star clusters in the batc photometric system , however , we also perform photometry for them in order to present a comprehensive and homogeneous photometric catalog .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite did not present photometry in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands for 184 sample clusters , since the images including these star clusters in these two filters had not been observed at that time .",
    "the photometric routine we used is iraf / daophot @xcite . to determine the total luminosity of each cluster , we produced curve of growth from @xmath19-band photometry obtained through apertures with radii in the range 211 pixel with 1 pixel increments .",
    "these were used to determine the aperture size required to enclose the total cluster light . the most appropriate photometric radius that includes all light from the objects , but excludes ( as much as possible and to the extent that was obvious ) extraneous sources is adopted independently for each cluster .",
    "this method ensures that we can determine the total cluster luminosity correctly , especially the use of small apertures for small clusters can maximize the s / n and minimize the contamination from nearby sources .",
    "in addition , we have checked the aperture of every sample star cluster considered here by visual examination to make sure that it was large enough to include all light from this object , but not so large as to be contaminated by other sources .",
    "the local sky background was measured in an annulus with an inner radius which being larger 1 pixel than photometric radius and @xmath20 wide , in which the mode was used .",
    "table 1 lists our new magnitudes and the aperture radii used , with errors given by iraf / daophot .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the cluster names , which follow the naming convention of @xcite .",
    "columns ( 2 ) to ( 16 ) present the magnitudes in the 15 batc intermediate - band filters .",
    "the @xmath21 magnitude uncertainties from daophot are listed for each object on the second line for the corresponding bands .",
    "column ( 17 ) is the photometric aperture adopted here .",
    "some sample clusters fall in the edges of the images ; b124-nb10 is saturated in the @xmath22-filter image ; b156-g211 and b515 fall in the bleeding ccd column of a saturated star in the @xmath22-filter image ; there is a bright source near b231-g285 in the @xmath18-filter image . in these cases ,",
    "we can not present star clusters photometry . in addition",
    ", photometry of some sample star clusters in some bands ( mainly in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands ) can not be presented here because of low s / ns .",
    "figure 2 shows curve of growth from different bands from @xmath17 to @xmath23 for 4 representative star clusters selected randomly : one compact and bright , b097-g159 , one extended and faint , b199-g248 , one compact and faint , b200 , and one extended and bright , b225-g280 . in figure 2 , the most appropriate photometric radius adopted here is indicated by triangles .",
    "for b199-g248 and b225-g280 , the most appropriate photometric radius obtained from the @xmath19 band is also most fitted in the other bands . for b097-g159 ,",
    "curve of growth from the @xmath18 band shows that the most appropriate photometric radius is @xmath24 , and the magnitude difference between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is 0.058 mag .",
    "however , the s / ns of b097-g159 in all the bands are low , and the photometric errors are larger than 0.1 mag in all the photometric apertures .",
    "so , when we consider the photometric errors , the photometric radius of @xmath25 is also appropriate in the @xmath18 band .",
    "for b200 , the s / ns in all the bands are very low .",
    "when we consider the photometric errors , the most appropriate photometric radius obtained from the @xmath19 band is also most fitted in the other bands .",
    "figure 3 presents the correlation between the radius of aperture adopted here and the magnitude in the @xmath19 band for the sample star clusters . from figure 3",
    ", we can see that , in general , the brighter a star cluster , the larger the aperture adopted here , although the scatter of luminosity is large for the same size of aperture .      in literature , @xcite and @xcite presented photometry of 184 sample clusters in 13 intermediate - band filters , and @xcite and @xcite presented photometry of 65 sample clusters in 15 intermediate - band filters , respectively .",
    "these authors adopted the same aperture diameter of @xmath27 for all their star clusters when performing photometry , and aperture corrections are computed using isolated stars .",
    "figures 46 compare our new photometry with that of previous studies @xcite , which show that our new photometry is in good agreement with that of previous studies for bright objects , while the photometric measurements published by previous studies seem to be somewhat brighter than ours for faint clusters .",
    "in addition , there are 3 star clusters ( au010 , b104-nb5 , and b126-g184 ) , of which the magnitude scatters in some bands between this study and previous studies are larger than 1.0 , i.e. , our new magnitudes are fainter than those of previous studies @xcite .",
    "we reported their names in figures 46 ( black circles ) .",
    "we checked the images of these three star clusters observed by the batc system , and found that they are all compact and faint , and near the center of m31 .",
    "in addition , they are superimposed onto an uneven background which is also bright .",
    "photometric aperture radii of them adopted here are @xmath28 , and larger aperture sizes would cause a large photometric scatter .      to examine the quality and reliability of our photometry , we compared the aperture magnitudes of the sample star clusters considered here with the magnitudes collected from various sources in the latest revised bologna catalog of m31 gcs and candidates ( rbc v.5 ) @xcite , and with previous measurements by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "first , we transformed the batc intermediate - band system to the broad - band system using the relationships between these two systems derived by @xcite :    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xcite presented self - consistent , optical ( @xmath29 ) photometric data for 285 m31 gcs .",
    "@xcite updated the bologna catalog @xcite with the homogenized optical ( @xmath29 ) photometry collected from many previous catalogs available in the literature , which is named the revised bologna catalog ( rbc ) . in order to obtain optical photometric data as homogeneous as possible",
    ", these authors took as a photometric reference the data by @xcite .",
    "the rbc has been updated collecting the latest data for m31 star clusters and cluster candidates .",
    "the latest rbc ( v.5 ) used here was updated on 2012 august . @xcite",
    "performed @xmath29 photometry for 970 m31 star clusters and cluster candidates based on archival images of the lggs .",
    "@xcite identified m31 star clusters using the images from the uk infrared telescope s wide field camera ( wfcam ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) archives , and presented photometry for 945 m31 star clusters and cluster candidates in the sdss @xmath35 and the near - infrared ( nir ) @xmath36 bands .",
    "figures 710 show the comparison of our photometry of the clusters considered here with previous photometric data in the rbc , with previous photometric measurements in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in figure 10",
    ", we have transformed the @xmath35 magnitudes to the johnson - cousins @xmath29 magnitudes using the equations given by @xcite .    from figures 710",
    ", we can see that our new magnitudes in the @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 bands are in good agreement with those in previous studies , while ours in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands are systematically fainter than those of previous studies . however , the photometric scatters in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands are the same as those in the other three bands .",
    "so , we consider that the photometric offsets in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands result from the formulas ( 4 ) and ( 5 )",
    ". if we add an appropriate constant value in the formulas ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , the photometric offsets between this study and previous studies in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands will disappear .",
    "in addition , there are some star clusters , of which the magnitudes in the @xmath29 bands between this study and previous studies ( galleti et al . 2004 ; barmby et al . 2000 ; fan et al .",
    "2010 ; peacock et al . 2010 ) are larger than 1.0 mag , i.e. , our aperture magnitudes are fainter than previous measurements in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to the very bright and uneven background around the clusters .",
    "these clusters are b129 , b254 , b333 , b391-g328 , dao55 , and nb16 .",
    "we reported their names in figures 710 ( black circles ) .",
    "@xcite estimated the masses of the sample star clusters based on the assumption of @xmath42 .",
    "however , the results of @xcite showed that m31 star clusters have the values of @xmath43 between 0.27 and 4.05 . in this paper",
    ", we will estimate the masses of the sample clusters by comparing their homogenous photometry obtained here with stellar population synthesis models .",
    "we use the galev ssp models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for our estimates as @xcite used .",
    "in fact , the masses of star clusters obtained here are independent of ssp models adopted here ( see details in section 3.2 ) .",
    "the galev models provide absolute magnitudes ( in the vega system ) in 77 bands for ssps of @xmath44 , including johnson @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the intrinsic absolute magnitudes and those given by the model provides a direct measurement of the cluster mass , in units of @xmath44 . to reduce mass uncertainties resulting from photometric uncertainties based on only magnitudes in one band ( in general ,",
    "the @xmath39 band is used ) , we estimate the masses of the sample star clusters using the magnitudes in the @xmath29 bands obtained here .",
    "the masses of clusters obtained based on the magnitudes in different bands are a little different , therefore we averaged them as the final cluster mass which may better reflect the true mass of a star cluster .",
    "the magnitudes of the sample clusters in the @xmath29 bands can be obtained using the equations ( 1)(5 ) . in order to correctly estimate their masses",
    ", we will consider the offsets of magnitudes between ours and those of previous studies .",
    "however , the captions of figures 69 showed that these offsets are different .",
    "so , as @xcite did , we take as a photometric reference the dataset by @xcite , i.e. , our new photometry has been transformed to this reference list by applying the offsets we derived here . in our estimates",
    ", the masses of the sample clusters are not independent of their ages and metallicities , which were taken from @xcite . in addition",
    ", the reddening values were taken from @xcite , who derived reddening values from three methods : ( 1 ) mean reddening values from available literature @xcite ; ( 2 ) median reddening values of star clusters located within an annulus at each 2 kpc radius from the center of m31 ( for these star clusters there are not available reddening values in the literature ) ; and ( 3 ) for star clusters at distances larger than 22 kpc from the center of m31 , the foreground reddening values of @xmath45 are adopted .",
    "we considered that the reddening values from @xcite are more reasonable .",
    "in fact , the reddening values of @xcite are generally in agreement with those of the literature @xcite .",
    "we can not estimate masses of 7 sample clusters , since @xcite did not present their ages and metallicities .",
    "the resulting mass estimates of 297 old star clusters are listed in table 2 with their @xmath21 uncertainties .",
    "we also list the absolute magnitudes in the @xmath39 band ( @xmath46 ) and the reddening values ( @xmath47 ) used here .",
    "figure 11 shows the comparison of our masses with those of previous studies ( barmby et al .",

    "@xcite estimated masses from the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath48 ) coupled with estimated ages , while @xcite determined masses based on the velocity dispersions and structural parameters of star clusters . in general , our estimated masses are in agreement with those published by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , while ours are slightly larger than those of @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is interesting that , for the most massive star cluster in m31 , b037-v327 , our new mass is in good agreement with those published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are two star clusters , of which the mass scatters ( @xmath49 ) between this study and @xcite are large , 0.93 for b461-g131 and 0.99 for b257-v129 , respectively .",
    "we reported their names in figure 11 ( black circles ) .",
    "the large mass scatters result from the adoption of different reddening values : for b257-v219 , 0.66 by @xcite and 1.17 here , respectively ; for b461-g131 , 0.10 by @xcite and 0.52 here , respectively .",
