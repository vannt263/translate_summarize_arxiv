    "the pronounced steps ( @xmath85 ) in the conductance are also seen as pronounced steps in the supercurrent .",
    "this shows the direct correlation between the supercurrent and the conductance .",
    "in particular one can see that as soon as the first ( @xmath86 ) transport mode contributes to the first conductance step at a gate voltage @xmath83v it also contributes to the first supercurrent step .",

    "this is the first time that a supercurrent which is carried by a single transport mode has been observed experimentally in a sqpc .",
    "the average hight of the steps of the conductance as a function of the gate voltage in fig.[icrnsteps ] is approximately @xmath87 , which gives us an effective average transmission probability @xmath88 for a quasiparticle travelling through the constriction .",
    "this can be attributed to the finite barrier potential at the 2deg - nb interface .",
    "a rough estimate@xcite of the the barrier strength @xmath26 at the interface can be derived from the relation @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the resistance of the sqpc at zero gate voltage and @xmath91 the sharvin resistance @xmath92 . with @xmath93 m and @xmath94",
    "nm we get for the sharvin resistance @xmath95 which results in a barrier strength @xmath96 or transmission probability @xmath97 .",
    "the reason for @xmath27 being smaller than @xmath98 can be attributed to the effect , that not all quasiparticles which are normal reflected from the 2deg / nb interface will be scattered back through the constriction .",
    "there could also be an inhomogeneity along the interface which will result in a varying transmission probability along the interface .",
    "@xmath27 is an average transmission probability along the junction width @xmath9@xmath10 m and @xmath98 is a local measure of the transmission probability on the length scale of the constriction width @xmath12 nm which can differ substantially from @xmath27 .",
    "another reason could be that the zero bias conductance at @xmath81mt is still affected by andreev reflection at the 2deg / nb interface.@xcite    the hight of the steps of the supercurrent @xmath13 as a function of gate voltage @xmath78 in fig.[icrnsteps ] depends on the gate voltage with increasing step hight for increasing step number .",
    "the step hight for @xmath99 is smaller than @xmath100na , which could be attributed to a reduced measured critical current due to thermal fluctuations and spurious noise in the measurement setup . from step @xmath101 to @xmath102",
    "we have a step hight of @xmath103na . from step @xmath102 to step @xmath104 the current increases by @xmath105na , which would result in a step hight @xmath106na , but unfortunately no clear steps for @xmath107 and @xmath108 are seen .    according to ref.@xcite the supercurrent step hight in the presence of scattering at the 2deg - nb interface",
    "is given by @xmath109na in the long junction limit ( @xmath110 ) and @xmath111na in the short junction limit ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "these values do not take any resonances in the supercurrent due to normal reflection at the 2deg - nb interface into account .",
    "this seems to be the case in our sample as we do not see any resonances in the supercurrent as a function of the gate voltage . from the critical current at zero gate voltage @xmath113a which is carried by @xmath114 transport modes",
    "we would expect an average critical current step hight @xmath115na , which agrees with the order of magnitude of the supercurrent step hights we have measured .",
    "we have measured the conductance and supercurrent quantization of a s-2deg - s josephson junction sqpc . by applying a gate voltage to the split gate",
    "the current was forced to flow within a constriction of width @xmath116 nm in the 2deg .",
    "both the conductance and the supercurrent as a function of gate voltage showed a pronounced steplike structure . for the first time",
    "it could be shown that the supercurrent and the conductance are directly correlated . especially we could detect a supercurrent in the sqpc which was carried by the first open transport mode in the sqpc .",
