    "using a circulating monochromatic antiproton beam at the isr and a hydrogen gas jet target , experiment r704 studied @xmath4 interactions at the center of mass energy range of interest for charmonium physics , with unprecedented energy resolution .",
    "however , before significant data were taken the isr was closed down and dismantled .",
    "experiment e760 was resurrected deploying the cooled antiproton beam at fermilab using much of the same technique as the original cern experiment . here",
    "much data were accumulated of relevance to charmonium physics in a variety of areas @xcite .",
    "we examine in this brief review the e760 result on @xmath5 $ ] , the sequel e835 follow up , and recent experimental studies at cleo / babar / belle in the light of new theoretical and phenomenological understanding .",
    "the e760 measurements of @xmath6 are summarized in table  [ measurements ] @xcite .",
    "these results have attracted theoretical attention @xcite with a calculation of the decay width for the @xmath7 process considering only the constituent quark mass correction , concluding that this kind of correction leads to @xmath8 in the range 1 - 10 ev .",
    "this is substantially smaller than an earlier conservative estimate @xcite which sensibly normalized the @xmath9 estimate to that of @xmath10 decay since both processes violate the helicity selection rule @xcite but data is available on the latter process , obtaining 186 ev .",
    "we note however that in @xcite murgia s final expression for @xmath8 [ c.f .",
    "( 34 ) ] , based on constituent quark mass corrections to the usual massless qcd models for exclusive processes , has a multiplicative dependence on @xmath11^{12}$ ] and hence is very sensitive to ( not very well known ) mass values for these charmonium states . in e760 @xcite",
    "there was the incorrect attribution that kuang - tuan - yan @xcite predicted @xmath12 kev .",
    "the actual phenomenological approach yields for this rate the value @xmath13 @xmath14 kev ( c.f .",
    "( 35 ) of @xcite ) where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the magnetic and electric couplings in the multipole expansion approach . to maintain theoretical reasonableness ( absence of large anomalous magnetic moment for quarks @xcite ) and the experimental constraint on @xmath17 from cleo @xcite",
    ", we must set @xmath18 .",
    "thus @xmath19 = 0.3 kev .",
    "this is reassuring since it reduces this isospin violating decay which seems too large in e760 @xcite . with this value , we infer in the language of e760 @xcite that @xmath20 for a total @xmath21 width of say 700 kev suggested by e760 @xcite , which is then order of magnitude wise quite consistent with @xmath22 = 186 ev estimated by @xcite , but at variance with the recent calculation of murgia @xcite .",
    "we continue to find the e760 result @xcite @xmath23 problematic .",
    "isgur et al .",
    "@xcite estimated that @xmath24 to @xmath25 , while bodwin , braaten , and lepage @xcite pointed out that the rate for @xmath26 has been estimated within a well - developed phenomenological framework @xcite to be of order of 6 kev , leading to @xmath27 .",
    "one of us @xcite noted that e760 @xcite also did not observe @xmath28 , a mode expected to be dominant with a branching fraction @xmath29 50% by any reasonable estimate .",
    "this could be due to the small @xmath30 branching fraction which strains the limits of e760 capacity to detect final state photons from @xmath31 .",
    "it remains strange that @xmath6 is discovered via this peculiar isospin violating mode involving single pion emission , while the isospin allowed dipion mode and the dominant @xmath32 mode remain to be identified .",
    "we recognize that a theory based on the stress - energy tensor in qcd can lead to dominance of single pion over dipion emission @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 was confirmed via the same mode in another hadron initiated experiment , e705 , @xcite at the same mass .",
    "however , for increasing the signal - to background ratio , they imposed the cut @xmath33 on the dipion mass distribution inspired by the @xmath34 distribution in the channel @xmath35 .",
    "kuang @xcite pointed out that this cut is not suitable for @xmath36 since the @xmath34 distribution for this process is not analogous to that in @xmath35 but is analogous to the kty @xcite dipion mass distribution for @xmath37 which is strongly peaked at the low dipion mass region .",
    "therefore the e705 experimental cut actually eliminates 73% of the signal events , so that it eliminates the chance of seeing this dipion decay mode of @xmath38 .    the position for the @xmath6 charmonium state",
    "is expected to be close to the center of gravity ( c.o.g ) of the @xmath39 states if the spin - spin contribution arising from the fermi hyperfine interaction ( due to one gluon exchange between @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be neglected @xcite .",
    "halzen et al .",
    "@xcite performed a one - loop perturbative correction to the @xmath42-@xmath43 and found it to be @xmath44 in accord with e760 @xcite , thus here the experiment does follow the conventional theoretical expectation .",
    "however , isgur @xcite is surprised by the smallness of the observed splitting , because it is difficult to understand why the non - perturbative couplings of the p - waves to virtual decay channels would not produce relative shifts amongst these states of order 10 mev .",
    "isgur notes that it would be interesting to understand whether the decoupling from these virtual channels is really as complete as it would appear from the halzen et al .",
    "@xcite result ( even though the @xmath45 continuum at 3871.2 mev is only a few hundred mev away ) or if this experimental / theoretical degeneracy @xcite is mainly accidental .",
    "we note that isgur s conjecture @xcite of an up to 10 mev ( upward ) shift in the position of @xmath6 is supported by the hyperfine spin - spin correction calculation of chen and oakes @xcite who find e@xmath46 - e@xmath47 = 4 to 6 mev which is several times larger than the e760 experimental value @xcite of @xmath48 mev .",
    "this also suggests that the agreement of the one - loop perturbative calculation @xcite with the e760 data is probably fortuitous .",
    "it is well to remember that for @xmath6 with an estimated width @xmath49 1.1 mev , e760 @xcite only scanned [ in increments ( decrements ) of 0.5 mev ] around the c.o.g .",
    "3525 mev of @xmath39 by about 12 mev ( i.e. @xmath50 , hence a mass shift of 10 to 6 mev @xcite from c.o.g . would have escaped their search ! [ note e705 @xcite has a 8 mev@xmath51 mass uncertainty in their observation of @xmath52 which reflects the statistical uncertainty in measuring c.o.g .",

    "[ ht ]    .e760 measurements on @xmath38 are compared with theoretical estimates . [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     it has been noted @xcite that vector confinement would be strongly ruled out by the discovery of the @xmath55 spin - singlet @xmath56 charmonium state by the e760 collaboration @xcite ; with typical @xmath57 potential model parameters , the vector confinement spin - spin term predicts a splitting between the c.o.g . of the @xmath58 triplet states and",
    "the @xmath59 of order 30 mev , whereas e760 @xcite finds that the splitting is about 1 mev .",
    "scalar confinement on the other hand would give a very small @xmath60 splitting , because there is no scalar spin - spin interaction , and the non relativistic oge spin - spin interaction is a contact term .",
    "indeed the * l.s .",
    "* pattern of the @xmath61 states looks like scalar confinement more than vector , independent of the location of the @xmath0 .",
    "so the proposed 6 - 10 mev shift @xcite of @xmath0 from @xmath62 would raise the very interesting issues of both modification of the naive @xmath63 spectrum and the relative proportion of vector vs. scalar components of the confinement potential .",
    "we remind that the shift is upward from the c.o.g .",
    "value because of the ( non relativistic ) stubbe and martin theorem @xcite .",
    "since 1998 there has been a recent paper by qiao and yuan @xcite which states that the statistical significance of the e760 @xmath6 @xcite is only a slightly more than @xmath64 signal with no other experiments confirming it ( the e705 @xcite confirmation is now in doubt as discussed in this section ) .",
    "hence the existence of @xmath6 is still based on very weak experimental signals .",
    "the authors @xcite proposed innovative methods of finding @xmath6 at hera - b . however a search strategy at hera need not be based on e760 s @xmath65 `` discovery '' mode , as discussed in the present section .",
    "finally there is the e835 upgrade of the e760 experiment .",
    "the design of the e835 detector is basically the same @xcite detector as e760 ( emphasizing photon detection ) , but with improvements in tracking and data acquisition capability . with significantly higher statistics the succeeding e835 experiment was unable to confirm e760 s enhancement in @xmath66 at @xmath67 mev which was supposed to be a candidate for @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "a promising approach for the detection of the @xmath0 has recently been proposed by suzuki and gu @xcite .",
    "suzuki suggests looking for the @xmath0 by measuring the final state @xmath69 of the cascade @xmath70 .",
    "this channel is especially timely given the announcement by the belle collaboration of the @xmath71 in b - decays @xcite and , previously , the observation of the related decay , @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite that the factorization - forbidden decay @xmath72 occurs as vigorously as the factorization - allowed decays to other charmonia e.g. @xmath73 .",
    "@xcite on the basis of this finding , we expect that another factorization - forbidden decay @xmath74 may occur just as abundantly as @xmath75 . since @xmath76 is one of the two main decay modes of @xmath0 , the decay @xmath74 cascades down to the final state @xmath77 about half the time",
    ". the only background for this process at the b factories will be the process @xmath78 . since the branching fraction for @xmath79 is miniscule , this background is two orders of magnitude smaller than the signal .",
    "if one can reconstruct @xmath80 from @xmath81 or by @xmath82 with say 50% efficiency , @xmath83 b s translate to roughly 100 events of the signal . therefore in principle",
    ", we have a very good chance to observe @xmath0 through @xmath84 . for @xmath85 ,",
    "suzuki @xcite estimated the cascade branching fraction @xmath86 gu s estimate @xcite of the cascade branching fraction is @xmath87 with @xmath88 b s , and an efficiency @xmath89 @xcite , there will be about 35 events of the @xmath0 .    the largest ( and the only ) uncertainty @xcite appears to be in the @xmath90 branching ratio .",
    "the heuristic assumption of a sizable branching for @xmath90 was based on the experimental discovery of @xmath75 by belle / babar .",
    "@xcite the main difference between @xmath53 ( j=0,1,2 ) and @xmath0 is not spins but charge parity .",
    "c=+ for @xmath53 seem copiously produced , but @xmath91 for @xmath0 is not yet seen .",
    "it is difficult to know how this difference in c plays out in the dynamics of decay , and theorists have no reliable way to compute it ( if they are careful and honest ) .",
    "it is nevertheless of interest that theoretical work @xcite obtain for the @xmath92 chain of eq .",
    "( 2 ) a value @xmath93 where the upper end is actually consistent with suzuki s estimate . as stated in suzuki @xcite , one will have to work harder for precision of the @xmath0 mass , meaning the resolution of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "just identifying @xmath0 at the b factories should not be difficult if it is there .",
    "we note also the phenomenological work of eichten _",
    "@xcite on @xmath94 that they estimate 11.7 k events for this chain .",
    "for comparison they noted that the sample that yielded the @xmath95 @xmath96 discovery events by belle @xcite was ( encouragingly ) about 30 k events .",
    "eichten _ et al . _",
    "@xcite estimate that for inclusive @xmath97 , while beneke _",
    "_ @xcite predicted that for inclusive @xmath98 with production of @xmath63 pair in the color octet state .",
    "however it was pointed out by de fazio @xcite that with their estimate of @xmath99 and suzuki s estimate given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the exclusive mode represents already a sizeable fraction of the inclusive @xmath100 decay .",
    "hence it will make sense to look for the inclusive @xmath101 production at belle / babar if exclusive @xmath102 is significantly lower than the suzuki @xcite and de  fazio  @xcite estimates .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the radiative width for @xmath103 is about 340 kev , while that for @xmath104 is about 350 - 500 kev .",
    "there are * no radial nodes * , so these should be fairly reliable predictions .",
    "so , it looks like both @xmath105 modes will be large branching fractions , since the total widths for @xmath106 and @xmath0 are expected to be of 1 mev scale",
    ". it would be a funny way to find the @xmath0 , once we find the @xmath106 experimentally !    there is a potential candidate for @xmath106 at @xmath107 , @xcite which is indeed not far from the nonrelativistic @xmath63 potential model prediction for @xmath108 at 3799 mev .",
    "@xcite an useful test@xcite for @xmath109 is that the @xmath110 and @xmath111 decays are allowed and expected to have widths in the range of 100 s of kev,@xcite and much larger than that for the isospin violating @xmath112 mode .",
    "if the @xmath107 were @xmath106 , the total exclusive branching fraction for @xmath113 decay , which is non - factorizable and suppressed by an @xmath114 barrier , would be anomalously large , typically@xcite @xmath115 @xmath116 .",
    "direct search for @xmath117 is currently underway at belle.@xcite from the viewpoint of @xmath0 search , this surpasses a search for @xmath118,@xcite,@xcite where absence of this mode would imply c=(+ ) with @xmath63 candidates in @xmath119 , @xmath120 as well as @xmath106 ( it could be consistent also with the deuson model @xcite with @xmath121 which remains viable particularly as @xmath107 sits on the @xmath122 threshold ) .",
    "steve  olsen  @xcite has pointed out that @xmath123 is damned hard experimentally ! moreover , the signal , if it is there , is only half of @xmath112 ; the @xmath124 efficiency is smaller than that for charged @xmath125 and the resolution is much much worse .",
    "hence it will be quite a while before any useful result from @xmath126 emerges from belle / babar .",
    "again we note that eichten _",
    "_ @xcite say that @xmath127 , 8.1 k events arise ( remember again that the sample that yielded the @xmath95 @xmath96 discovery events  @xcite was about 30 k events ) , hence they hold out for simultaneous observation of @xmath106 and @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the babar collaboration @xcite in setting an upper limit for the narrow ( @xmath128 state in the decay @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , did not deploy @xmath131 ( with branching ratio @xmath132 ) , whereas @xmath130 including @xmath133 corrections discussed by one of us @xcite is estimated to have miniscule partial width @xmath134 kev .",
    "however , we believe the babar collaboration @xcite is primarily interested in @xmath135 decay measurements .    since the predicted radiative partial width for @xmath136 is especially large , which suggests that decays to @xmath137 may provide a discovery channel for the elusive @xmath0 .",
    "one possibility @xcite is @xmath138 , followed by the decay chain @xmath139 , @xmath136 .",
    "since these electromagnetic couplings are all reasonably well understood , detection of @xmath0 would simply be a matter of accumulating adequate statistics at a high- energy @xmath140 facility ( e.g. belle / babar ) or even at rhic , with sufficient @xmath141 luminosity at @xmath142 = 3.7 gev .",
    "indeed cleo , @xcite before being reconstructed to become a lower energy @xmath140 facility cleo - c , had established @xmath143 and using the method of barnes _",
    "_ , @xcite concluded that @xmath144 kev .",
    "this is at most a factor of 3 lower than quark model estimate @xcite with @xmath145 kev .",
    "munz @xcite summarized / obtained other predictions between a factor of 2 to 3 smaller than the quark model estimate .",
    "the data set consists of @xmath146 decays observed with the cleo iii detector at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "@xcite hence the cleo sample of hadronic @xmath147 decays ( @xmath148 ) will be nearly 15 times @xcite their previous total some ten years ago .",
    "the most straightforward search for @xmath2 was proposed @xcite as @xmath149 , where the mass of @xmath150 mev c.o.g .",
    "value of @xmath39 mass values according to the stubbe - martin theorem .",
    "@xcite the standard multipole model @xcite predicts for @xmath151 a spectrum in which the @xmath152 mass distribution is strongly peaked at the lower @xmath153 end .",
    "as pointed out by rosner @xcite this comes from the fact that the @xmath152 system should be @xmath154 , and the @xmath155 transition must proceed with final state l=1 between the dipion and the @xmath2 state .",
    "the peaking peculiar to this transition , may allow one to * strengthen the @xmath2 signal by selecting dipions with particularly low mass*. in the case of the earlier cleo work of f. butler _",
    ", @xcite , an upper limit of @xmath156 at @xmath157 confidence level was established . the standard multipole model estimate given by one of us",
    "@xcite is that @xmath158 should bracket the range @xmath159 to @xmath160 , while voloshin @xcite will predict a further factor of 0.05 reduction over th standard multipole model value . with",
    "nearly 15 times more hadronic @xmath147 accumulated since ten years ago , it will be interesting to push the @xmath161 limit further , but deploying the rosner @xcite suggestion of selecting dipions with particularly low mass , to enhance a possible @xmath2 signal .",
    "caveat _ is appropriate when dealing with radial excitation states like @xmath147 and @xmath162 .",
    "rosner @xcite pointed out that suppression of @xmath163 , @xmath164 decays in the famous @xmath165 puzzle , could be due to a radial node in @xmath166 .",
    "could there be a similar suppression in say @xmath167 or @xmath168 recently proposed by kuang @xcite as a search method for @xmath169 of course @xmath170 and @xmath171 do exist , but are they to be regarded as large or small in some context , let alone that @xmath0 and @xmath2 represent different exclusive channels from radially excited @xmath172 and @xmath173 to @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively ?",
    "the calculation of ackleh and barnes @xcite suggests that radially excited @xmath176 is at most a factor of three higher than experimental measurement , @xcite so here radial node suppression is relatively modest . with respect to @xmath177",
    "there could be lack of phase space ( not always a problem though since @xmath178 is dominant with essentially no phase space @xcite ) and isospin violation as well ( not a problem for voloshin @xcite though ) .",
    "however at bes ii , the accumulation of @xmath166 is only about @xmath179 events , @xcite hence kuang s estimate @xcite of @xmath177 based on @xmath180 ( and an efficiency @xmath181 ) needed to be reduced accordingly .",
    "there could be an indirect test of the validity of the standard multipole kuang - yan model @xcite outside of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , in terms of their prediction that @xmath182 is about 24 kev . here",
    "the cleo experiment @xcite obtained for @xmath183 for a sum over all different @xmath184 values .",
    "this upper limit is inconsistent ( lower by a factor of about 7 ) with the rate estimated by rosner @xcite using the kuang - yan model for @xmath185 , @xcite and a factor of about 3 higher than the predicted rate based on the model by ko .",
    "@xcite the cleo upper limit @xcite is about 30 times higher than those predicted by moxhay s model @xcite which uses the voloshin @xcite approach .",
    "there is then the bes measurement @xcite of the @xmath186 rate ( supportive of kuang - yan @xcite ) .",
    "godfrey @xcite pointed out that the reduced rate for the @xmath187 system found by rescaling the bes measurement , @xcite is considerably larger than the rate found by rescaling the @xmath188 cleo limit .",
    "@xcite however godfrey @xcite still believes that it is likely one can reconcile the @xmath189 and @xmath63 results by properly taking into account @xmath190 mixing .",
    "it is believed that the @xmath191 found by cleo at 10,161 mev @xcite is likely the @xmath192 since there is good agreement with lattice qcd calculations and potential models . as stressed by rosner , @xcite",
    "since the @xmath193 threshold is quite far from @xmath191 , coupled channel effects should be small , so the potential models should be reliable .",
    "the prediction is probably good to within 0.02 gev , with 10.16 gev the central value .",
    "hence we expect the @xmath194 to lie in this neighborhood .",
    "production of @xmath194 could again lead to large e1 transitions @xmath195 and @xmath196 , for @xmath2 and @xmath197 search .",
    "however production of @xmath194 from @xmath147 is a spin - flip transition .",
    "the c - parity allows @xcite @xmath198 but it is a highly hindered m1 transition , @xcite and is estimated to have a partial width of 0.04 ev !",
    "the short term objective on the search for @xmath0 should clearly be concentrated on pushing further the limits on @xmath199 of the suzuki - gu @xcite approach at belle / babar .",
