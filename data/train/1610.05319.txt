    "the origin of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) is still unknown , despite intense theoretical studies and observational efforts .",
    "a new generation of detectors have collected , in the last decade , data with unprecedented statistics in both hemispheres . the pierre auger observatory @xcite ( hereafter auger ) , operating in argentina since 2004 , is the largest observatory , with @xmath3  km@xmath4 effective detection area , and an integrated exposure of @xmath5 as of march 31@xmath6 , 2014 , mostly in the southern sky .",
    "telescope array @xcite ( hereafter ta ) , operating in utah ( usa ) since 2007 , covers @xmath7  km@xmath4 , and obtained an integrated exposure of @xmath8 as of may 11@xmath9 , 2015 , in the northern sky .",
    "the results reported by the two international collaborations ( ta and auger ) concerning the energy spectrum , composition and angular distribution show some potentially significant differences .",
    "while a joint analysis working group concluded that the uhecr composition estimated by both experiments are compatible @xcite , the ta and auger spectra appear to be different in shape , and an intermediate - scale anisotropy has been reported by the ta collaboration , while the auger skymap does not show a statistically significant deviation from isotropy despite its larger exposure .",
    "while the difference in the spectra might possibly be due to energy - dependent systematics , we explore here the possibility that one or several source(s ) in the northern sky is ( are ) responsible for both the excess in the high - energy spectrum and to the so - called hotspot in the ta data .",
    "although the conjunction of these two observations may appear natural and consistent at first sight , with a particularly intense and/or nearby source producing a larger flux than average as well as a distinct cluster of events , the quantitative study of this conjunction rather points towards a severe conflict .",
    "as it turns out , and will be demonstrated in the present study , the excess in the ta flux compared to auger is so large above @xmath10  eev , that a much stronger anisotropy than the one observed is to be expected in general .",
    "while large deflections of the uhecrs by intervening magnetic fields may be invoked as a way to `` wash out '' the anisotropy , this seems essentially impossible if the flux is dominated by protons , and even in the case of heavier nuclei , large deflections tend to reduce the possibility of strong localised flux excesses , notably in the case of transient sources , because they spread the flux over larger time windows .    in order to quantify the problem at hand and to estimate the likeliness of such a combination of observations , we carry out detailed simulations of uhecr propagation in both the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and the galaxy , and",
    "distinguish between two general classes of sources : transients and steady .",
    "in the transient case , we use a specific model for the sources , based on grbs @xcite , which reproduces both the spectrum and composition observed by auger",
    ". some characteristics of this model , such as the source composition and spectrum and the distribution of maximal energies and intrinsic luminosities among sources , are also kept as a reference for the steady source case .",
    "the first three are roughly essential for consistency with the auger data .",
    "the last one is not , but lacking other information it is as good as any .",
    "overall , we expect the results presented here to be generic and qualitatively independent of the specific nature of the sources .",
    "we first investigate , in sect .",
    "[ sec : significance ] , the significance of the difference between the auger and ta measurements .",
    "we then present in sect .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] a simple analytical estimate to determine the conditions under which a single source could contribute at a high level . in sect .",
    "[ sec : simulations ] we discuss the monte carlo simulations , where we take into account the propagation of the uhecrs from their sources to the earth , including the model parameters and the procedure used to generate auger - like and ta - like data sets from which sky maps can be built and analysed .",
    "we present , in sect .  [",
    "sec : results ] , the results of our simulations , applying definite criteria to assess the similitude or compatibility of the simulated data sets with the actual observational data . finally , we summarise the results and discuss their possible implications in sect .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] .",
    "the possible difference in composition of the uhecrs observed by ta and by auger has been widely discussed , after the claim by ta that their data is compatible with a pure proton composition ( see for instance @xcite , whereas auger reports a gradual , but very significant trend towards higher mass nuclei around 10  eev @xcite .",
    "the ta data is not inconsistent with the transition towards heavier elements inferred from the auger data @xcite ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "* for a different interpretation of the data ) .",
    "the difference in the clustering of events as well as in the energy spectrum appears more striking , and apparently more significant . while no significant small or intermediate - scale anisotropy",
    "can be observed in the auger data ( the largest departure from isotropy was found to have a post - trial probability of @xmath11% @xcite ) , the ta collaboration reported a so - called hotspot , with a @xmath12 angular scale , near the constellation ursa major .",
    "the chance probability of observing such a clustering anywhere in the sky is @xmath13 , equivalent to a one - sided probability of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a second anisotropy analysis of the highest energy events ( above 57 eev ) uses the two - point correlation function and compares the number of pairs of events separated by less than a given angular scale , to what is expected with the same exposure map for a purely isotropic flux .",
    "this test yields a minimal chance probability of @xmath15 at angular scales between @xmath12 and @xmath16@xcite .",
    "while such levels of significance are too low to be conclusive , it should be considered together with another difference , regarding the energy spectrum above @xmath17  eev .",
    "[ fig : spectrumdata ] depicts the auger and ta data , where a shift of @xmath18 has been applied to the ta energy scale , as recommended by the auger - ta joint working group @xcite .",
    "the ta spectrum clearly shows a significant excess at higher energy , at least if one considers only the statistical error bars ( shown on the plot ) .",
    "a systematic uncertainty with a rather strong energy dependence would be needed to explain such a difference .    after scaling down the energy by 13% there are 83 highest energy ta events above 50  eev .",
    "they correspond to an exposure of 8600  km@xmath19 @xcite . on the other hand , auger reports 231 events above 52  eev , for an exposure of 66452  km@xmath19 . given the shape of the spectrum between 50  and 60  eev , this extrapolates to @xmath20 events above 50  eev .",
    "if the auger flux is assumed to represent the average uhecr flux in the absence of anisotropy , then the expected number of events for ta is @xmath21 .",
    "the actual integrated flux of ta would thus need to be a 7@xmath22 upward fluctuation .",
    "it thus appears unlikely that the uhecr fluxes observed by auger and ta are just different realisations of an underlying roughly isotropic flux .",
    "put together with the observation of the ta hotspot , the current data suggest the possibility that not only the apparent excess in the ta spectrum above 50  eev is real ( unless large energy - dependent systematic uncertainties impact the measurements ) , but also that this excess could be caused by the contribution of one ( or more ) localised sources , which would dominate mostly in the northern sky .",
    "quantitatively , if the integrated flux of auger above 50  eev represents an average contribution of typical sources distributed more or less isotropically over the sky , the corresponding contribution in the ta data should be @xmath23  events , which leaves @xmath24 for the putative additional source(s ) . in order words , if the difference between the two spectra is taken seriously and attributed to the contribution of a dominant source , this source may represent 45%60% of the total northern sky flux .    to this end ,",
    "we do not limit ourselves to the consideration of the spectrum .",
    "a satisfying model must not only provide two different spectra in the northern and southern hemispheres , but also reproduce the anisotropy patterns : it must i ) be compatible with isotropy in the southern sky ( i.e not produce an anisotropy signal much stronger than the warm spot reported around the direction of cen a , with a 1.4% post trial chance probability to arise as a fluctuation of an isotropic flux ) , and ii ) provide a hotspot in the northern sky with a typical angular scale of 20@xmath0 .",
    "concerning the other observable of uhecr phenomenology , namely the composition , it is taken into account here in a generic way . in @xcite ,",
    "some of us have developed a model based on the acceleration of particles in the mildly relativistic internal shocks of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "this model reproduces the spectrum and composition , both below and above the ankle @xcite . from a phenomenological point of view , the main features of this model are a low value of the maximum energy for protons at the sources , a hard source spectrum for all nuclei except protons ( which have a significantly softer spectrum ) , and a source composition with a metallicity higher than the usual galactic cosmic - ray component by a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "these are considered here as generic features of a \" working model  , providing a suitable description of the average uhecrs , independently of the actual sources , whether grbs , other types of transient sources ( like tidal disruptive events , see e.g. @xcite ) , or steady sources . for the purpose of the anisotropy analyses of this paper ,",
    "the main relevant ingredient is the composition of the uhecrs with an energy larger than 50  eev , which is thus assumed to be the same as that of our explicit grb model @xcite , but without prejudice regarding the nature of the sources .",
    "we describe now a simplified analytical investigation of the conditions under which an individual source can be responsible for a significant fraction of the total uhecr flux observed on earth above an energy @xmath25 ( e.g. @xmath26  eev ) . in parallel",
    ", we estimate under the same conditions the angular size of this source in the sky . as can be easily understood , the situation is different depending on the nature of the sources , whether transient or permanent . in both cases , the apparent angular size of a given source on",
    "the sky depends on the deflections of the particles by the intervening magnetic fields .",
    "however , the apparent flux level of a source can not be estimated in the same way for transient and steady sources .",
    "obviously , we can only see a transient source when it is active towards us , i.e. when the difference in time between the moment when we are observing it and the moment when it was actually active matches the particle propagation time .",
    "but the _ spread _ in this propagation time is what sets the instantaneous flux level . for a given total amount of energy emitted by the source ,",
    "the apparent luminosity is simply inversely proportional to the spread of the time delays . in practice , we consider as a transient source a source for which the typical variation of the intrinsic luminosity timescale is shorter than the propagation time delay from the source to the earth . in this case , the effective luminosity is dictated by the total energy release during the transient event divided by the propagation time spread .",
    "we also assume , for the sake of simplicity , that the sources are standard candles .",
    "this is a conservative assumption , since a spread in the intrinsic source luminosities typically increases the variance of the contribution of the dominant source to the total flux , so the probability to obtain a higher flux fraction becomes larger @xcite .",
    "three steps of propagation , associated with different types of deflections and time delays , can in principle be distinguished : i ) around the source , before the freshly accelerated uhecrs reach the igm , ii ) in the igm between the source and our galaxy , and iii ) in our galaxy , up to earth .",
    "for the analytical estimates below , we gather these contributions into one standardised step , corresponding to the propagation of particles through a homogeneous medium filled with an isotropic turbulent magnetic field with a coherence length @xmath27  mpc and intensity @xmath28  ng .",
    "this is of course a very crude assumption , but it gives an idea of the link between the deflections and the scale of the intervening magnetic fields .",
    "note that the specific influence of the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) is analysed in more detail in the following sections , as it turns out to play an important role , especially in the case of transient sources .    in the limit of the weak scattering regime ,",
    "where the larmor radius of the cosmic - ray is larger than the turbulence scale of the magnetic field , the typical scale of the angular deflections of a particle with charge @xmath29 and energy @xmath30  ev , coming from a source at a distance @xmath31  mpc , is given by @xcite : @xmath32 if the dominant class of nuclei at 50  eev is cno @xcite , the angular deflection is of the order of 1418@xmath0 in a nanogauss egmf with a mpc coherence length for a source located at 10  mpc , or 7.510@xmath0 for a source located at 3  mpc . in comparison ,",
    "the typical deflection in a 5  @xmath33 gmf with a coherence length of 200  pc over 1  kpc , is of the same order , around 810@xmath0 .",
    "we now turn to the conditions under which a source may contribute a given fraction of the total uhecr flux received on earth . in principle , this fraction depends on energy , as the apparent source spectrum is expected to be different from the overall uhecr spectrum shaped notably by the gzk horizon effect .",
    "we thus consider only the integrated flux above a given energy , @xmath25 ( e.g. @xmath26  eev ) , and denote by @xmath34 the fraction of the total flux above that energy , which is contributed by the individual source . in all cases , we assume that the source emits uhecrs isotropically .",
    "note that , in principle , an excess in the spectrum in some part of the sky could be due to the contribution of two sources located by chance in the same hemisphere , rather than to the contribution of just a single source .",
    "however , a simple reasoning shows that this is in general much less probable .",
    "essentially , the flux from one source is typically reduced by a factor of 2 if its distance is increased by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "now , it appears that the chance probability for one source to contribute a substantial fraction of the uhecr flux is relatively low , of the order of a few percent in the favorable scenarios .",
    "this is related to the probability to find a source closer than some distance @xmath36 , which we may write @xmath37 .",
    "the probability to find two sources in the same hemisphere closer than the distance @xmath38 , i.e. in a volume @xmath39 larger , is then given by @xmath40^{2 } \\simeq 4\\times \\mathcal{p}_{1}(d)^{2}$ ] .",
    "since @xmath37 is much smaller than 1/4 , this has a much smaller probability .",
    "therefore , in the analytical exploration below , we consider only the case of one dominant source being responsible for the excess in the overall flux .      in the case of bursting sources , the apparent flux of a source , @xmath41 ,",
    "is governed by its total energy ( emitted in the form of uhecrs above @xmath25 ) , @xmath42 , its distance , @xmath43 , and the average time spread , @xmath44 , over which it is visible from earth in the considered energy range .",
    "it is given by : @xmath45    this should be compared with the average uhecr flux on earth above @xmath25 , @xmath46 , which can be approximately expressed in terms of the average source energy , @xmath47 , the source rate , @xmath48 , and the gzk horizon scale , @xmath49  mpc , as : @xmath50    in the above - mentioned magnetic field configuration , the spread in the time delays is approximately given by @xcite : @xmath51    note that , here , we abusively use the expression for the average time delay of the particles , instead of its spread over an ensemble of particles .",
    "this is not strictly correct , and indeed in the detailed simulations discussed in the next sections , the flux level of the sources is determined by the actual propagation time of each individual particle , obtained through a full monte - carlo procedure , taking also into account the rigidity losses along the way . however , for the current analytical estimate , we keep the above formula which has the advantage of providing an explicit dependence in the various parameters . by this",
    ", we acknowledge the fact that , according to the simulations , the spread in the time delays of the bulk of the particles is indeed of the same order as the average time delay .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phiapp ] ) and  ( [ eq : phiuhecr ] ) , we can simply write the ratio between the flux of the source under study and the total flux expected on average ( over space and time in the local universe , i.e. over the so - called _ cosmic variance _ ) above @xmath25 .",
    "this will be referred to below as the source - to - average - total ( or stat ) flux ratio .",
    "it reads : @xmath52 where we noted @xmath53 the over - luminosity of the source under consideration . in the case of standard candles , of course , @xmath54 .",
    "obviously , a very nearby source will give a very high flux fraction .",
    "however , @xmath34 depends very strongly on the source distance , as its fourth power , since @xmath43 comes in both through the trivial @xmath55 flux factor , and through the apparent time spread of the source , proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , one needs to estimate the probability to find a source within a given source distance .",
    "the average number of transient sources , active at any given time , in a sphere of radius @xmath43 , is @xmath57 . for low values of @xmath58",
    ", this is also the probability to find a source within @xmath43 .",
    "note that we are implicitly interested in situations where this number is low indeed , since we are interested in the dominant source , whose flux compares to the total flux of all other sources contributing in that energy range .",
    "it must thus be exceptional by its proximity and/or small time spread , which would not be the case if @xmath58 were close to 1 or more .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : etaflux ] ) can now be inverted to give the distance at which a source with over luminosity @xmath59 must be located to provide a given stat ratio , @xmath34 : @xmath60    the corresponding probability , for @xmath54 , is then found to be : @xmath61 as an example , let us consider cno nuclei at @xmath62  eev and a source rate of one burst per gpc@xmath63 per year . if the deflexions and time delays are similar to what would produce a homogeneous turbulent egmf with @xmath64 , the probability that a dominant source contributes at the same level as the rest of all other sources in one hemisphere , i.e. @xmath65 is of the order of 3% .",
    "although not common , this does not seem particularly unlikely .",
    "however , one must also consider the angular extension of such a source .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatheta ] ) , one obtains the angular size expected for a source that would contribute a fraction @xmath34 of the global uhecr flux , i.e. be located at distance @xmath66 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : distance ] ) : @xmath67    as can be seen , the dependence on the various parameters is weak , except on the ratio @xmath68 , which is simply the larmor radius of the particles ( times @xmath69 ) .",
    "for cno nuclei at 60  eev in a nanogauss field , one obtains @xmath70@xmath71 .",
    "this appears too small to account for the ta observations . as a matter of fact , a source that would contribute ,",
    "say , 50% , of the total flux and would span over 9@xmath0 in the sky.therefore , if the apparent difference in the uhecr spectrum between the northern and southern hemispheres is to be attributed to the contribution of one dominant source , then the angular spreading of the source must be due mostly to the action of the gmf , at least if the extragalactic magnetic field ( egmf ) does not significantly exceeds a nanogauss . for a pervading egmf of 3  ng , say , the angular size would increase by a factor 2.3 , while the probability of a given contribution to the overall flux would decrease by a factor 1.7 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : probaetafluxburst ] ) ) .",
    "note that the angular size of a source could be increased if the source is surrounded by a large magnetic halo , which by itself has a large angular extension over the sky .",
    "however , in the case of transient sources , such a halo would also considerably extend the time spread of the uhecrs from that source , and thus strongly reduce its apparent luminosity .",
    "a key question is thus whether the gmf can increase the angular spreading of a source sufficiently to reconcile the idea that the spectral differences between the two hemispheres are due to a dominant source with the anisotropy data .",
    "unfortunately , the gmf is not known with enough precision to give a definite answer to this question .",
    "we discuss this point below in more detail , in particular with the comparison between the situations in the northern and southern hemispheres , which turn out to be different , but we recall here the estimate of sect .",
    "[ sec : tvsp ] , which gave @xmath72 for a length of 1  kpc through a 5  @xmath73 g with @xmath74  pc .",
    "obviously , the deflections depend on the length of the trajectory through the gmf , and thus on the direction of the source , within or away from the galactic disk . in addition",
    ", the size of the magnetic halo above the disk appears to be a crucial parameter ( as well as its coherence length ) .",
    "an extension much larger than 1  kpc , still with significant magnetic field , would lead to significantly larger deflections , and could explain the absence of a well marked , small scale anisotropy , even if a large fraction of the total flux can be attributed to one source with relatively limited angular spread at the entrance of the galaxy .    finally , it is instructive to calculate the typical time spread of the uhecrs detected from a dominant source with stat ratio @xmath34 .",
    "this is easily obtained as a function of the various parameters , by reporting the required source distance , @xmath75 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : distance ] ) , into the expression of @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : timespread ] ) .",
    "one finds : @xmath76    for cno at 60  eev , the typical time spread is thus of the order of a few tens of kiloyears for the dominant source .",
    "it can be seen that a larger egmf allows for a larger time spread , but only linearly , whereas @xmath44 increases as the square of the magnetic field for a given source distance .",
    "thus , the larger value of @xmath44 allowed for a larger magnetic field is actually related to the necessity of having a closer source , which then reduces the probability of such an occurence ( see eq .  [",
    "eq : probaetafluxburst ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the case of steady sources , which inject uhecrs in the intergalactic medium at a constant luminosity , @xmath77 . like before , we allow for a different luminosity of the source under consideration , @xmath78 , and note @xmath79 .",
    "the flux received from that source is simply : @xmath80 while the average uhecr flux from all sources within the gzk horizon , @xmath81 , is : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the source density .    the stat flux ratio is thus given by : @xmath84    the distance where a source must be to account for a flux ratio @xmath34 is thus : @xmath85    as in the case of transient sources , the probability to find a source within this distance is essentially the average number of sources in the corresponding volume , namely @xmath86 .",
    "this gives : @xmath87    regarding the angular spread of such a source , it is estimated as before using eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatheta ] ) : @xmath88    the dependence on the various parameters is larger than in the case of transient sources , because the flux level does not depend on any time spread , and thus on the magnetic field .",
    "however , the source angular extension does not depend strongly on the source density , which has a greater influence on the probability of the situation under investigation .",
    "for cno nuclei at 60  eev in a nanogauss magnetic field , we obtain an angular size of the order of 1015@xmath0 , which is again too low to account for the ta hotspot .",
    "however , a stronger magnetic field can increase this angular size linearly , and a contribution of the gmf may also be important .",
    "note that in a case of a pure proton composition scenario , the angular size of a hotspot would be smaller than @xmath89 for a nanogauss magnetic field and a source distance of 10 mpc .",
    "thus it would be even more difficult to account for the anisotropy observed by ta .",
    "in the previous section , we estimated the conditions under which one source may contribute a significant fraction of the total uhecr flux , and the probability that this situation occurs at a given moment in time , in a given location of the universe .",
    "the main outcome is that this probability may be of the order of a few percent for a relatively wide range of parameters , in the case of steady sources as well as in the case of transient sources .",
    "concerning the angular size of this source on the sky , it appears that the egmf alone is usually too low to spread the particles over a region much larger than 1015@xmath0 ( cno nuclei at 60  eev ) , so that such a source would produce significant small - scale anisotropies , at variance with the current observations .",
    "however , larger values of the egmf in the direction of the source or a significant contribution of the gmf to the overall deflections could in principle allow the scenario under study to be viable .    in this section and the next , we use a complete monte carlo simulation of the source distribution and history and of the uhecr propagation to study the transient and permanent source scenarios in more detail , taking into account the gmf and the actual exposure of auger and ta in their respective part of the sky , and comparing our simulated sky maps and spectra with the data . the criteria used to assess the overall compatibility of these sky maps with the actual data are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] . here , we describe the central numerical tool of the simulation , base on our monte - carlo propagation code , which is used to compute the propagation of uhecrs from individual point - like sources , taking into account their energy losses , their nuclear transmutation through the interaction with the cosmological photon background , and their deflections in the intervening magnetic fields ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details about our propagation code ) .            concerning the magnetic deflections and the distribution of uhecrs over the sky , we first follow the trajectory of individual particles through the egmf , assuming a random kolmogorov - like turbulent field with r.m.s . value @xmath90 , and a principal turbulent scale of 1  mpc ( which corresponds to a coherence length @xmath91  mpc ) .",
    "to model the egmf , we follow the numerical procedure of @xcite .",
    "the egmf is assumed to be distributed homogeneously throughout the universe .",
    "although this is admittedly not realistic , it allows us to explore the influence of the magnetic field , with a wide range of possibilities , from 0.01  ng , below which the effect would be essentially negligible on the present studies , to 10  ng , which may be considered as a maximum value for a consistent and pervasive magnetic field . as can be noted from the analytical study of sect .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] , the magnetic field value and coherence length always appear through the product @xmath92 . therefore , for the present study , it is not necessary to vary these two parameters separately .",
    "we thus chose to keep the coherence length fixed , and simply vary @xmath90 , in the range from 0.01  ng to 10  ng .",
    "for instance , the case corresponding to @xmath93  ng and the default value of @xmath94  mpc is equivalent to a case with @xmath95  ng and @xmath96  mpc .",
    "we then take into account the propagation in the galaxy .",
    "the large - scale structure of the gmf is modeled as in @xcite ( hereafter jf12 ) . in the following description we use cartesian ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) and cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 , z ) .",
    "the galactic center is at the origin , galactic north is in the positive @xmath99-direction , and the sun is located at @xmath102 kpc . in the jf12 model , the magnetic field is set to zero for @xmath103 kpc and in a 1 kpc radius sphere centered on the galactic center .",
    "the large - scale coherent field , hereafter denoted by @xmath104 , involves three separate components : a disk field , a halo field , and an out - of - plane halo component , the latter being motivated by radio observations of external galaxies @xcite .",
    "the gmf disk component is divided into eight logarithmic spiral regions and its strength varies from @xmath105 to 4 @xmath73 g .",
    "two large - scale reversals occurs between spiral arms 2 and 3 , and 6 and 7 .",
    "the vertical extension of the disk field is @xmath106 kpc above the disk midplane .",
    "the gmf halo component is a purely toroidal field with an exponential scale height , @xmath107 ( @xmath108 kpc ) , and with spatial extensions and amplitudes that are different in the north and the south . in the north , @xmath109 g , while in the south @xmath110 g .",

    ", we add a purely turbulent component , @xmath114 , following the numerical procedure of @xcite .",

    "the r.m.s .",
    "value follows the magnitude of the regular component with an overall enhancement factor of 3 .",
    "finally , we also include a so - called striated magnetic field , which consists of an anisotropic turbulent component , @xmath116 , whose orientation is aligned with the large scale coherent field , but whose strength and sign vary on a small scale . following jf12",
    ", we use @xmath117 .",
    "this assumes that the striated field is generated from the regular field by shear .",
    "another possible origin of the striation could be the compression of the isotropic turbulence ( beck , private communication ) .",

    "the resulting local value of the gmf ( near the earth ) is consistent with the 6 @xmath73 g value inferred from observations @xcite .",
    "we also consider the possible presence of a magnetic field around the source itself . in the absence of a well defined model ,",

    "the ordinate shows the probability that a given source be located in a direction of the sky for which the variance of the angular shift between the position of the source and the actual arrival direction of an observed uhecr from that source is equal to the value in abscissa . ]",
    "the gmf becomes important when the egmf is typically smaller than @xmath120  ng . in these cases",
    "its contribution is significant and may even dominate the deflection and the corresponding time delays , as far as the closest sources are concerned .",
    "we recall that the typical deflection of particles at rigidities 8 - 9 ev is smaller than @xmath121 in the extragalactic nanogauss field for a source located at 10 mpc ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : angularsize ] ) . at these rigidities",
    "the deflections by the gmf are of the order of @xmath121 to @xmath12 , depending on the arrival direction of the particle , as explained below .",
    "the gmf has several important effects .",
    "first , of course , it deflects the particles and makes a given source appear larger on the sky .",
    "this effect adds to the deflections through the egmf .",
    "second , it may cause some magnification or demagnification of the sources , depending on the arrival direction of the particles in the galaxy ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , a small solid angle around some specific directions in the sky ( as observed `` backwards '' from the earth ) may gather the particles coming from a larger ( respectively smaller ) solid angle at the entrance of the galaxy , so that the sources located in these directions can appear with a larger ( resp .",
    "smaller ) flux than if no deflections applied .",
    "like all effects related to the magnetic field , this effect depends on the rigidity of the particles , i.e. it may select a given mass range at a given energy , or a given energy range for a given type of nuclei .",
    "this effect was discussed in @xcite , where magnification maps were also shown , so we do not discuss it further here . however , we recall that our simulations take it into account in a consistent way , by applying the relevant magnification factor to the flux of each individual source in the sky , depending on the arrival direction of their uhecrs .",
    "the third effect of the gmf is that it introduces some time delay , in addition to that caused by the egmf .",
    "this effect is very important in the case of transient sources , since the spread in the time delays has a direct incidence on the apparent flux of a given source ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : analytical ] ) .",
    "now , it is very interesting to note that the northern and southern hemispheres are not equivalent in this respect , due to the asymmetry of the gmf , notably the different northern and southern extensions of the galactic halo .",
    "smaller dispersions in the time delays are significantly more common in the part of the sky observed by ta than in the part of the sky observed by auger .",
    "this result was obtained from a systematic study , where we divided the sky in 49152 pixels covering identical solid angles , and determined the variance of the time delays caused by the gmf for a large number of particles ( 256 on average , depending on the magnification ) observed in the corresponding directions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : timedelayspread ] , we show the cumulative distribution of the spread in time delays , assuming a random source position with equal probability in any direction of the sky .",
    "this probability is shown by the solid line curves in the case of uhecrs observed by auger , while it is shown by the dashed line curves in the case of ta .",
    "we show the results for three different values of the rigidity , namely @xmath122  v , @xmath123  v and @xmath124  v. the first one corresponds for instance to c nuclei at 60  eev ( or o nuclei at 80  eev or protons at @xmath122  ev ) , while the last one corresponds to fe nuclei at 100  eev .",
    "[ fig : timedelayspread ] clearly shows that the probability of a short time delay , is much larger if the source is mostly seen in the ta sky .",
    "of course , this difference in the `` northern '' and `` southern '' time spreads introduced by the gmf is only relevant when the values are larger than the time spreads introduced by the egmf .",
    "we find that this is essentially the case for egmf values smaller than 0.3  ng , which is consistent with the egmf - induced time delay estimated for the dominant source in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltat ] ) .",
    "the average value of the time delays in the gmf and their spread over all possible directions is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : timedelayspread ] as a function of the rigidity of the particle . at high rigidities , they both scale as @xmath125 , as expected in the weak scattering regime ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : timespread ] ) .",
    "the structure of the gmf introduces a similar difference regarding the angular spread of the sources , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angularspread ] .",
    "the plots show the variance of the particle deflections in the same conditions , i.e. for particles observed in the ta sky ( dashed lines ) and in the auger sky ( solid lines ) , for three values of the rigidity and two values of the field coherence length .",
    "the most probable angular spreads are typically smaller in the ta sky than in the auger sky . finally ,",
    "while a small spread in the uhecr time delays translates into a high instantaneous flux in the case of transient sources , it should be noted that additional time delays are likely to originate from the magnetic field in the environment of the source itself , which could be that of the host galaxy or extend from the scale of a local circumstellar environment up to the scale of a galaxy cluster ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . in our simulations",
    ", we simply assume that the typical time delays associated with the exit of the uhecrs from their sources to the general intergalactic medium is similar to those introduced by our own galaxies .",
    "since the orientation of the host galaxy with respect to the line of sight ( and to a possible source axis , in the case of beamed ejection of uhecrs ) is a priori random , we draw randomly in the distribution of time spreads among different directions across the host galaxy .      to build simulated sky maps corresponding to a given astrophysical scenario , we first need to choose the location of the sources . in the case of steady sources , we simply draw randomly the source locations in 3d space according to the source density , with equal probability in all directions of the sky . although matter is not distributed uniformly in the local universe , this simplification has no significant incidence on our results , which are analysed from the point of view of their total energy spectrum and their intrinsic anisotropy , at intermediate angular scales , rather than their correlation with specific classes of sources or matter distribution .",
    "note that the source density specified in each case is actually a comoving density ( i.e. with a fixed average source number per comoving volume ) and that we also allow for a possible evolution of the individual source power as a function of redshift .",
    "this , however , has no significant impact on the spectra and anisotropy patterns in the gzk energy range , given the short horizon scale . in the case of transient sources",
    ", we also need to specify the time of their occurence , which is chosen randomly according to a certain rate .    for definiteness , we choose the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) source model described in @xcite , where the uhecrs are accelerated at the internal shocks of grbs , as a reference model . from this model",
    ", we borrow some characteristics , which may be considered as generic properties that typical source models must have to reproduce the auger data , such as a mixed composition with high metallicity and a hard spectrum with low proton maximum energy . the same is assumed here for all sources , whether transient or steady .",
    "many properties may in principle vary from one class of sources to the other , none of which can however be directly inferred from the current data .",
    "for instance , while the average injection rate density , expressed in @xmath126 , is well constrained by the observed flux , we do not know the total energy injected in the form of uhecrs by individual sources , nor even its average , which is directly related to the source density in the case of steady sources , or to the source occurence rate in the case of transient sources . until the sources are identified ,",
    "these can essentially be regarded as free parameters in the general modelling of the uhecrs .",
    "in addition , it should be kept in mind that all sources may not have the same luminosity . in the absence of better - motivated assumptions ,",
    "we adopt the relative luminosity distribution that results from the calculations in the framework of our grb source model , and apply it throughout this paper.this is thought to be more realistic than the standard candle assumption .",
    "the corresponding transient source occurrence rate is @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "we also explored 10 times larger and 10 times smaller rates , but found that it did not change the outcome of the study significantly ( in conformity with the analytical estimates , where the rate appears with a power 1/8 as far as the apparent angular size is concerned , and 1/4 regarding the flux excess probability , see eqs .",
    "[ eq : probaetafluxburst ] and  [ eq : angularsize ] ) .",
    "note that we consider sources emitting uhecr isotropically .",
    "this includes the case of transient sources although there are observational evidence and energetic arguments favoring a beamed emission from grbs @xcite . while the assumption of an isotropic assumption has essentially no impact on our results for values of the egmf of @xmath128 ng ( at least as long as the contributions of the strongest sources are concerned ) , this no longer true for larger values of the egmf .",
    "moreover , in the case of a beamed emission of uhecrs , the flux received from a given grb event could also be affected by the angular spreading of the jet in the immediate vicinity of the source depending on the magnetic environment of the host galaxy and on the exact value of the beaming angle . ignoring these potential complications ,",
    "the predictions we make especially regarding the probability of a strong flux excess in the ta have to be considered as relatively optimistic , all the more when the assumed egmf is of 1 ng or larger .",
    "even in the framework of our simplifying hypotheses we will see however that it is extremely difficult to account for the present observational data with a transient source scenario .",
    "once all the relevant parameters have been defined , we build the sky maps by picking individual uhecr events , one after the other , until we reach the required number to match the integrated flux seen by auger above a reference energy of 5 eev , namely 59500 events ( as of march 31 , 2014 , for a total exposure of 66452 km@xmath129 sr yr ) . although chosen arbitrarily , this energy is low enough for the uhecr flux to be considered essentially isotropic at this energy , and the corresponding number of events is large enough to not suffer from significant statistical fluctuation ( including cosmic variance ) in the auger data .",
    "the way we draw the individual events reflects the complexity of the underlying phenomenology . in the case of transient source , we first calculate numerically the all - particle spectrum for a given realisation of the grb history in the universe , taking into account galactic and extragalactic time delay distributions .",
    "this calculation allows us to build probability tables for the energy distribution , the redshift distribution at a given energy , the discrete sources contribution at a given redshift and a given energy and for the different sources contributing significantly the probability distribution of the different species and the associated distributions of deflexion angles .",
    "our datasets are then produced by sampling successively these probability tables .",
    "we first draw the energy @xmath130 of the particle , then we draw the redshift at which the particle was injected by its source in the intergalactic medium . given the redshift , we then pick up an actual source , choosing randomly among the possible ones , in case there are several in the corresponding redshift range for the specific realisation of the distribution of sources under study .",
    "we then draw randomly the mass and charge of the particle .",
    "from there , we pick the deflection angle in the egmf for a particle with the identified energy and charge coming from this particular source .",
    "given the position of the source , we then know the arrival direction of the particle in the galaxy .    at this stage ,",
    "the study of galactic deflections comes in . by inverting the result of a massive backwards propagation calculation ( see the description of the method in @xcite ) , we obtained for each arrival direction outside the galaxy the probability of being seen on earth from a given direction in the sky .",
    "we can thus draw an actual arrival direction accordingly .",
    "the final steps consist in two acceptance / rejection draws , to take into account the magnification factor ( we draw a random number between zero and the maximum magnification factor at the relevant rigidity over the whole sky ) and the exposure of the experiment under consider ( auger , ta , or a hypothetical full - sky , uniform exposure experiment ) . if the event is kept in these last steps , we attribute a reconstructed energy by applying a random gaussian relative error to each event with a width of 15% in the case of auger , and of 20% in the case of ta . the event is then included in the dataset and the procedure is repeated until the number of events with reconstructed energies above 5  eev is 59500 in the case of auger .",
    "this gives in average @xmath131 7700 events above 5  eev in the case of ta as expected from the ratios of the time integrated exposures of the two observatories .",
    "the full dataset is used to calculate the observed spectrum while the 231 ( respectively 83 ) highest energy events are selected in the auger ( respectively ta ) sky to compare their intrinsic anisotropy to that of the observational data .    in the case of steady sources ,",
    "the procedure is exactly the same , except for the random draw of the redshift of the source , since the individual sources are assumed to be permanent and their contribution to the present flux is integrated over redshifts ( i.e. look - back times ) .      given the assumptions summarised above , the free parameters of the models are the egmf value , the gmf coherence length and the source density or occurence rate . for each set of these parameters , the observed spectra and",
    "the distribution of the uhecr events over the sky may be very different , depending on the actual position of the sources , and their occurrence time in the case of transient sources .",
    "the range of these variations is usually referred to as the cosmic variance . in order to explore these various possibilities",
    ", the procedure is repeated several times for each choice of the model parameters .",
    "specifically , for each model we produce 1200 random realisations of the grb explosion history , and 600 random realisations of the the source distribution in the universe in the case of steady sources .",
    "then , for each of these realisations , we produce 10 random data sets with the intended statistics ( i.e. 59500 events above 5  eev in the auger sky ) , whose differences reflect statistical fluctuations of the same underlying sky map , energy spectrum and composition . thus , in total , we obtain 12000 and 6000 realisations of each individual astrophysical scenario .",
    "[ sec:2pthotspot ]    once generated , the data sets are analysed from the point of view of their intrinsic anisotropy , in order to assess their degree of compatibility with the actual data . for this , we use two standard analyses , which have been applied by the ta and auger collaborations to their own data .",
    "the first one is the so - called 2-point correlation function analysis .",
    "it consists in computing the number of pairs of events with an angular separation smaller than a given angle @xmath132 , and compare this number to the numbers of pairs obtained from random data sets with the same total number of events , but built from a purely isotropy flux .",
    "one determines , for each angular scale @xmath132 , the fraction of isotropic data sets which have a larger number of pairs within that angular separation than the data set under study .",
    "this can be noted @xmath133 , as it gives the probability that a purely isotropic uhecr flux would produce at least as many pairs of events separated by an angle lower than @xmath132 . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on the smallest value of @xmath133 , as @xmath132 varies from @xmath134 to @xmath135 , which we note @xmath136 .",
    "the corresponding angular scale is noted @xmath137 .    the second analysis of the anisotropy of the simulated data sets is a simple clustering analysis .",
    "it follows closely the analysis performed by the ta collaboration , which led to the identification of their so - called hotspot [ tapaperonhotspot ] . for each simulated data set ,",
    "we apply a circular `` top hat '' with an angular size of 20@xmath0 around a given position in the sky , and simply count the number of events detected within that angular distance .",
    "we then compare this number with the number of events expected from a purely isotropic flux ( with the same coverage map and exposure ) , and determine the significance of the corresponding clustering signal using the standard li - ma statistics @xcite .",
    "this significance of course depends on the position of the center of the circle in the sky map . after scanning the entire sky , we record the largest significance value obtained for the data set under consideration , and call it the raw ( or unpenalised ) hotspot significance",
    "this value , which we note here @xmath138 , is then compared with the corresponding value in the actual ta dataset .",
    "in order to determine whether a given astrophysical scenario can account for the main features of the uhecr flux measured on earth , we generate a large number of simulated data sets as described in the previous section , corresponding to the auger and ta coverage maps and exposures , respectively , and then study the compatibility of these simulated data sets with the actual data . for this",
    ", we use general criteria based on the corresponding energy spectrum and the analysis of the intrinsic anisotropy of the data sets .",
    "the latter analysis is performed on sky maps which are built , for each realisation , with the same number of events as the data to which it is compared ( i.e. with the 83 highest energy events in the case of the ta , and with the 231 highest energy events in the case of auger ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the `` infinite statistics '' all - sky spectrum , averaged over 300 realisations of the astrophysical scenario .",
    "the gray area shows the range corresponding to the 90% cosmic variance ( see text ) .",
    "the orange area corresponds to the spectra of 90% of the 3000 ta - like simulated data sets ( 10 per realisation ) , while the orange solid line is the average of these spectra over all 3000 data sets .",
    "the auger and ta data are also shown , with 1-@xmath22 statistical error bars .",
    "the energy scale of the ta data set has been shifted down by 13% ( see * ? ? ?",

    "more precisely , the value in each energy bin is the average of the bin content for all the realisations .",
    "note that the bin values for each realisation are not independent , as some realisations may involve for instance a particularly nearby and bright source , therefore leading to a flux that is consistently higher than average over many consecutive bins .",
    "the grey shaded area corresponds to the 90% fluctuation range of the individual bin contents .",
    "the underlying astrophysical model is already known to reproduce the main features of the auger uhecr data @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not a surprise that the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrumdata ] is compatible with the auger data , shown with the violet points on the plot .",
    "the ta data are also displayed , with a shift of @xmath139% in the energy scale , to match the auger spectrum at low energy .",
    "the solid red line on fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrumdata ] shows the average spectrum expected for the same model , assuming the ta exposure map ( and an energy resolution of 20% ) . as can be seen , this average spectrum is higher than the average all - sky spectrum .",
    "more interestingly , the range of variations of the spectrum in this part of sky and with the ta statistics is found to be quite large .",
    "this is represented by the orange shaded area , which shows the 90% variation range ( including both cosmic variation and statistical fluctuations ) .",
    "the top of this area appears to be still slightly below the ta data , which indicates that a uhecr flux as high as that measured by ta might be expected is at most a few percent of the cases , in the same scenario which otherwise gives an average spectrum similar to that of auger .      among the large number of simulated data sets , we are interested in the specific realisations which produce a spectrum compatible with both with ta and auger spectra ( see an example in appendix [ sec : exampleofrealisation ] ) .",
    "now , of course , we need to quantify the likeliness of such realisations.in order to perform a systematic analysis of the spectra associated with all the produced data sets , we establish a criterion of compatibility with the ta data by comparing the integrated fluxes above 50  eev .",
    "we define @xmath140 as the number of events above that energy . in the ta data set used in the present paper , which is obtained with a total exposure of @xmath141 ,",
    "there are 83 events with an energy larger than 57 eev , which corresponds , after the above - mentioned downward shift of the energy scale , to @xmath142  eev .",
    "therefore , the value of reference for ta is @xmath143 . in our simulated data sets ,",
    "we allow for an upward or downward statistical fluctuation of this number by 1.5@xmath22 , i.e. we set as a criterion that the ta - like simulated data sets must have a value of @xmath140 between 70 and 97 , in order to be judged compatible with the data .    , and the energy of the 83@xmath144 most energetic event , @xmath145 , in the ta - like simulated data sets , for the grb transient source model with @xmath146  ng . ]    alternatively , after ordering the uhecrs in the simulated ta - like data sets by decreasing energies , we may ask what is the energy of the 83@xmath144 event , which we note @xmath145 .",
    "obviously , @xmath147  eev in the actual ta data set .",
    "we can then use the value of @xmath145 in the simulated data sets as another criterion to determine whether they may be compatible with the ta data , as far as the global spectrum is concerned .",
    "of course , both values , @xmath140 and @xmath145 , are strongly correlated : the higher the energy flux , the larger the energy of the 83@xmath144 event .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : n50e83correl ] . from this correlation plot , built with all 12000 simulated data sets , one can see that the criterion that @xmath148 is roughly equivalent to @xmath149 .",
    "this alternative criterion has a slight practical advantage in our analyses , because the sky maps we build always have the same number of events in the ta sky , namely 83 , to allow for a direct quantitative comparison of their anisotropy patterns with those of the ta data , as discussed below .",
    "a selection criterion should also be applied to the auger - like simulated data set , notably to reject realisations for which the flux excess in the ta sky is due to a dominant source , which also contributes significantly to the uhecr flux in the auger sky , thereby producing a spectrum that does not match the auger spectrum at high energy . since our auger - like sky maps",
    "are built with 231 events , we use the value of the energy of the @xmath150 event , @xmath151 , to build a selection criterion .",
    "while @xmath152  eev in the auger data , we accept all realisations for which @xmath153  eev .",
    "we found that this criterion is rejecting only a small fraction of the simulated data sets , which is due to the fact that the auger data are generally well reproduced by our models .",
    "the second challenging feature of the available data sets is their level of anisotropy .",
    "as it appears , the anisotropy level of the ta data is surprisingly low , when put into perspective with the observed flux excess . the general qualitative statement saying that a dominant source that would be responsible for that flux excess is likely to produce a strong anisotropy is indeed supported by our quantitative study , and it appears extremely challenging to reconcile both features of the data , as we show below .    concerning the anisotropy , we use two complementary criteria . the first one is based on the two - point correlation function of the uhecr arrival directions . as indicated in sect",
    ".  [ sec:2pthotspot ] , for each data set we compare the number of pairs of events with angular separation smaller than a given angle @xmath132 with the number of pairs expected in the case of a purely isotropy flux , for @xmath154 . the largest departure from the isotropic expectations among the various angular scales",
    "is noted @xmath136 . in the actual ta data set , the value of @xmath155 , which is reached at the angular scale of 22@xmath0 . as shown below , most of the simulated data sets having a spectrum compatible with that of ta show a much larger @xmath136 .",
    "we set a criterion requiring @xmath136 to be between @xmath156 and @xmath157 , and that the angular scale at which @xmath136 is reached has to be larger than 15@xmath0 .",

    "we set as a criterion that the most significant departure from isotropy in the form of a hotspot should have a li - ma significance @xmath138 between 4.6 and 5.6 .",
    "finally , we apply an additional criterion to the auger - like simulated data sets , requiring that the 231  highest energy events in the auger sky do not show a much stronger anisotropy than the actual auger data through the two - point correlation function analysis .",
    "we use again @xmath136 as the relevant quantity , and reject all realisations for which 7 or more of the 10 data sets built from a given realisation have a @xmath136 value smaller than @xmath158 .    in the following subsections",
    ", we show the results of our simulations , confronting the data sets with the above flux and anisotropy criteria , first taken separately , and then taken together .",
    "table  [ tab : criteria ] summarises them .",
    ".summary of the criteria used to assess the compatibility of the simulated data sets with the auger and ta data .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     although these numbers are reasonably large , fig .",
    "[ fig : pminsteady ] shows that much larger anisotropies are also fairly common .",
    "for these two values of the egmf between 3% and 12% of the ta - like simulated data sets have a value of @xmath136 as low as @xmath159 , depending on the source density and egmf .",
    "now , as noted in the previous section for transient sources , these are the most likely to exhibit large flux excesses , so that most of the data sets satisfying one or the other of the flux and anisotropy criteria may have difficulties to satisfy both .",
    "this is further studied in the next subsection , where we combine several constraints .",
    "the second anisotropy criterion relates to the clustering properties of the ta - like simulated data sets , through the value of @xmath160 defined previously .",
    "the cumulative distribution of this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumulsigmasteady ] for 4 different values of the magnetic field and the two different source densities .",
    "the compatibility range , between 4.6 and 5.6 , is indicated by the grey area . as could be anticipated",
    ", the data sets corresponding to larger values of the egmf have a smaller probability to show a very large anisotropy .",
    "however , the influence of the source density can be seen to be relatively moderated .",
    "this is reminiscent of the result of our simplified analytical study , where we found that the angular scale of the dominant source in the sky had a weak dependence in @xmath161 , with a power 1/4 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : angularsizesteady ] ) . again",
    ", even though a few percent of the data sets have clustering properties compatible with that of the ta data , a substantial fraction of those have clusters which are in fact much more significant than the ta hotspot . now these are the most likely to be the ones with a high flux excess above 50 eev , as required by the ta spectrum .",
    "the situation in the case of a 10 ng field is quite different , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pminsteady ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cumulsigmasteady ] , the probability of observing a strong anisotropy decreases quite drastically passing from a 3 ng to a 10 ng egmf .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the case of the largest field , the propagation time needed , say for a o nucleus at 50 eev , to be isotropized is in average of the order of 100 myr ( see @xcite ) while it takes approximately 10 times larger in the case of a 3 ng field .",
    "with such a large field , one thus enters a regime where the isotropization time of the highest energy nuclei becomes significantly shorter than their ( time-)horizon for energy losses ( with is of the order of 100 mpc / c for a 50 eev o nucleus ) . in other words , for such a strong value of the egmf , only uhecr nuclei coming from relatively nearby sources ( well within the horizon ) have a chance to reach the observer without being previously completely isotropized on their way . the more drastic condition for a uhe nucleus not to be isotropized on its way results in a significantly lower probability to get a strongly anisotropic sky .",
    "interestingly , with such a lower probability of a strong anisotropy the 10 ng field case is the only case for which the probability to see much stronger anisotropy that what is seen in ta data is not significantly larger than the probability to see a flux excess compatible with the data , this is all the more true for the clustering properties .",
    "the different elements to allows the combined analyses of the spectrum and anisotropy constraints for the steady case are reported in table  [ tab : summarysteady ] and displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : correl2ptn50steady40 ] ,  [ fig : correl2pttophatsteady40 ] and [ fig : correltophatn50steady40 ] . before discussing the combined analyses ,",
    "it is first useful the discuss the individual criteria and in particular @xmath140 , the number of events above @xmath162  eev , reported in table  [ tab : summarysteady ] .",
    "we remind that both table  [ tab : summarysteady ] and the scatter plots only take into account realisations which have passed both the auger 2-point and auger flux criteria ( see table .  1 ) .",
    "the number which appear in table  [ tab : summarysteady ] for the @xmath140 criterion look at first in contradiction with fig .",

    "this apparent contradiction can however be understood considering that a majority ( @xmath167 ) of the dataset showing a value of @xmath168  eev also have @xmath169  eev and thus do not pass the @xmath140 criterion .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that most of the realisations having a @xmath145 in the appropriate range to fulfil the @xmath140 criterion ( and which thus are not among the @xmath170 of the realisations showing the largest flux excess ) are in fact due to sources located in sky region of relatively exposure for the ta observatory which are precisely the portions of the sky which are also visible for the pierre auger observatory . as a result most ( @xmath171 ) of the datasets which are in the appropriate range of @xmath140 in the low density and low magnetic field cas",
    "also show strong anisotropies in the corresponding auger datasets and are thus rejected by the auger 2-point cut .",
    "the situation is less severe for the 1  ng and 3  ng cases .",
    "the flux attenuation due to larger value of the magnetic , makes the probability of obtaining large value of @xmath145 or equivalently @xmath140 lower and the value of @xmath140 in the appropriate range are now mostly due to sources located in high exposure regions of the ta sky for which the overlap auger is lower .",
    "the effect of the auger 2-point cut is thus milder in the 1 ng case and all the more in the 3 ng case . for the latter moreover ,",
    "even if the strongest source is located in the overlap between auger and ta skies , the probability to be rejected by the auger 2-point cut is significantly lower than than for the lower fields .",
    "finally , in the case of the 10 ng , still for the low density case , the strongest source distance is usually large enough so that its flux is highly deflected during the extragalactic propagation and thus visible in both hemispheres . for most datasets a large a value of @xmath145 also results in a large value of @xmath151 and those realisations are thus rejected by the auger flux cut .",
    "the different effects discussed above are much less severe for the largest density case ( @xmath172 ) . as can be seen in fig .  13 , the probability for a large value of @xmath145 is lower than in the low density case and depend less on the value of the egmf .",
    "the appropriate flux excesses are mostly due sources located in large exposure portions of the ta sky .",
    "the auger 2-point cut is then less effective and rejects a lower fraction of the realisations . on the other hand in the 10 ng case , the larger density assumed leads to closer sources which means that their flux is less likely to be fully isotropized a trigger also a flux excess in the auger sky .",
    "these elements partly explain why in the combined analysis of the spectrum and anisotropy we discuss in the next paragraphs the larger density case will turn out to be more favorable in the attempt of reproducing the observed data .",
    "we now turn the correlation between @xmath140 and @xmath136 , show in fig .",
    "[ fig : correl2ptn50steady40 ] .",
    "each dot on the scatter plot corresponds to a ta - like simulated data set built from the steady source model with a source density of @xmath173 .",
    "four different values of the magnetic field are superimposed , each with a specific colour . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : correl2ptn50transient ] , the dashed area show the region where data sets are considered as passing the compatibility criteria of sect .  [ sec : criteria ] .",
    "similar comments as in the case of transient sources can be made .",
    "first , it is clear that most simulated data sets are very far from the compatibility region .",
    "they have much lower values of @xmath140 , i.e. their integrated high energy flux is much lower , and their anisotropy is smaller .",
    "however a large subset of the simulated data sets have a two - point correlation function indicator , @xmath136 , compatible with that of ta , as already shown in the previous subsection . but",
    "as can be seen , the vast majority of these data sets do not have any particular excess in the high - energy flux , and are thus incompatible with the ta data . on the other hand",
    ", there is a small fraction ( see above ) of the data sets which do have a large flux excess , but almost all of them exhibit a much larger anisotropy than the ta data , with values of @xmath136 lower than @xmath159 , all the more for the lowest values of the egmf .",
    "nevertheless , a few data sets happen to satisfy both criteria at once mostly in the largest density case : 9  for an egmf of 10  ng , 3  for an egmf of 3  ng , 1  for an egmf of 1  ng , and none for an egmf of 0.1  ng ( see table  [ tab : summarysteady ] ) .",
    "while quantitative conclusions can not be drawn from such small number statistics , it does appear that larger magnetic fields are more favorable than lower ones .",
    "this is due to the larger angular spread , large magnetic fields are in fact required , to attenuate the anisotropy due to the most nearby source which would otherwise be too strong . in the case of lower magnetic fields , the realisations predicting a value of @xmath140 in the appropriate range , result much too strong anisotropies , and the corresponding data sets are systematically much below the compatibility box in the scatter plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : correl2ptn50steady40 ] .",
    "the situation worsens in the low density case , while their number is dramatically reduced by the auger criteria , realisations passing the @xmath140 almost systematically show very strong anisotropies .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : correl2pttophatsteady40 ] and [ fig : correltophatn50steady40 ] , we show the other two scatter plots corresponding to the correlation between @xmath136 and @xmath138 and between @xmath138 and @xmath140 , respectively , in the case of a source density of @xmath174 mpc@xmath175 . as in the case of transient sources ,",
    "the clustering and 2-point correlation criteria are jointly satisfied only for a small subset of the data sets . as can be seen in table  [",
    "tab : summarysteady ] , @xmath13125 to 30 @xmath176 of the realisations passing the @xmath138 criterion also pass the @xmath136 ( the other being in most cases too anisotropic from the point of view of the 2-point analysis ) .",
    "although this fraction is relatively large , it means that the two criteria are not redundant . as for the correlation between @xmath138 and @xmath140 , fig .",
    "[ fig : correltophatn50steady40 ] shows that it tends to extend a bit more towards the compatibility region in the case of high magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , for low values of the egmf , most of the data sets compatible with the ta flux excess above 50  eev are much more strongly clustered than the ta data , with too large values of @xmath138 ( upper right part of the scatter plot ) .",
    "it also appears clearly again that high values of @xmath140 are very uncommon , and that it is particularly difficult to satisfy the criterion on @xmath140 together with an only moderate anisotropy ( especially for low values of the egmf ) .",
    "putting the flux and anisotropy criteria together , we see , for most combinaisons of the value of the source density and the egmf , a very strong reduction of the number of acceptable data sets . like in the case of transient sources , this is simply due to the fact that large excess in the flux require a very strong source , which is then very hard to `` hide '' in the anisotropy searches .",
    "obviously , the best chance to reduce the excessive anisotropy is to increase the magnetic field .",
    "the number of acceptable data sets is thus largest for the 10  ng . in that case @xmath131 1/3rd of the realisations passing the @xmath140 criterion , also pass one of the two anisotropy criteria , this fraction appears to be much larger that in the lower magnetic field cases .",
    "nevertheless , when requiring all three criteria together ( plus the implicit criteria related to auger ) , only 2 data sets remain , belonging to the same realisation of the steady source scenario with @xmath173 and @xmath93  ng .",
    "the characteristics of such a realisation are shown and detailed in the appendix [ sec : exampleofrealisation ] .    , with the values of @xmath136 vs. @xmath138 , as defined in sect .",
    "[ sec : criteria ] , for a steady source density of @xmath174 mpc@xmath175 . ]    , with the values of @xmath138 vs. @xmath140 , for a steady source density of @xmath174 mpc@xmath175 . ]",
    "in this paper , we have addressed the compatibility between the auger and telescope array data on ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "we first showed that , taken at face value , the two energy spectra do nt appear to be mutually compatible .",
    "the ta spectrum can not be considered a mere statistical fluctuation of the auger spectrum , and vice versa , even if one allows for a global shift in the relative energy scale of the two experiments . in particular , the integrated flux measured by ta above 50  eev is significantly larger than that of auger .",
    "this can not be accounted for if the underlying uhecr flux is approximately the same in all direction , as the current anisotropy analyses reported by auger suggests .",
    "however , the ta collaboration has reported a possible hotspot with an angular scale around 20@xmath0 in the northern hemisphere , in a part of the sky that is not observed by auger .",
    "one may thus ask whether both features  a cluster of events and an excess in the flux at the highest energies  could be two complementary manifestations of a single reality : the presence of a very bright source in the northern sky .    assuming that the current auger and ta data are indeed representative of the actual characteristics of the uhecrs in their respective parts of the sky , we investigated the possibility , for a given source model , to satisfy the various observational constraints .",
    "we considered a wide range of astrophysical scenarios , including transient sources or steading sources , as well as different source densities and different values of the egmf .",
    "our simple analytic estimates show that such a flux excess could typically occur at most in a few percent of the cases , either in the transient source scenario or in the steady source scenario",
    ". however , the flux excess needed to account for the difference between the auger and ta spectra corresponds to a number of events which is much larger than the number of events in the ta hotspot .",
    "we estimated that if the flux excess is to be explained by the contribution of one dominant source , that source should contribute around @xmath177 events in total , while the number of events in the so - called ta hotspot represents only @xmath178 of the total number of events including some possible background . besides , it is striking that the highest energy events are not present in the hotspot region itself .",
    "in particular , in the initial report of the presence of an intermediate scale anisotropy in @xcite , none of the 12 events observed by ta above @xmath179  ev ( 7 if the energy is rescaled downward by 13% ) can be found within 20@xmath0 of the hotspot center .",
    "this can be explained within our scenarios by simply noting that the rigidity of the highest energy particles is in fact smaller than those at intermediate energies , due to the change in composition .",
    "more specifically , cno nuclei at 60  eev have a rigidity twice as large as fe nuclei at 100  eev . the highest energy events might thus very well ( and are actually expected to ) be deflected more than the particles between 50 and 60  eev , say .",
    "our analytical estimates also suggested that the angular size of the hotspot associated to the flux excess is too small compared to the one observed by ta . in this respect , it is interesting to note that transient sources suffer from a general problem : larger deflections , as needed to fit the angular extension of the dominant source , also imply larger spreads in the particles arrival time , which in turn reduce the apparent flux of the source , and thus makes it even less likely for a source to contribute a large fraction of the total uhecr flux .",
    "steady sources , on the other hand , do not suffer from this problem , since their apparent flux does not depend on the time spread of the particles , but only on its distance .",
    "larger magnetic fields , at least in the direction of the source , might thus in principle increase its apparent angular size , without reducing its flux .",
    "our detailed simulations took into account the various effects influencing the propagation of the uhecrs , including energy losses , photodissociation in the case of nuclei , and deflections by the intervening magnetic fields , around the source , in the intergalactic medium and in the galaxy . a remarkable feature that we noticed",
    "is that according to the representative model of the gmf by @xcite , uhecr propagation is significantly different in the northern and southern skies .",
    "the galactic magnetic deflections are smaller at the north and hence the angular spreads and time delays are typically smaller for particles in the ta sky than in the auger sky .",
    "our results are summarised in tables  [ tab : summarytransient ] and  [ tab : summarysteady ] .",
    "overall , we find that transient sources are essentially incapable of reproducing the data",
    ". the steady source scenario does not appear prima facie to be very favorable either , with a probability @xmath180 % to account for the reported data , because of the very low probability to have a strong , nearby source in the northern sky .",
    "however steady sources are more likely than transients to account for data sets with general features reminiscent of the auger and ta data .",
    "this difference between the two models arise because of the possibility to accept larger particle deflections , to attenuate the strong anisotropy usually produced by a strongly dominating source .",
    "large values of the egmf are needed in this case .",
    "a clear requirement of such solutions is the necessity to have a very nearby source , within @xmath181 mpc as can be inferred from figure [ fig : distances ] ) , in order to obtain a large flux excess in some part of the sky .",
    "indeed such nearby sources such as m82 have been suggested as the origin of the ta hotspot @xcite .    concerning the underlying assumptions , the scenarios studied here rely on some generic features of the grb source model developed in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we used the same source composition and energy spectra , as well as the same distribution of relative luminosities at the sources .",
    "we argued and verified whenever possible that these specificities are not likely to modify significantly the conclusions of the study .",
    "indeed , as far as the composition is concerned , it was shown previously to satisfy the current observational constraints derived from the auger data .",
    "we note than an even heavier composition than the one we considered could in principle help attenuating the anisotropies , without reducing too much a possible flux excess in the ta sky , if the dominant source is far from the region of the sky observed by auger , and most of its flux remains confined within the northern equatorial hemisphere .",
    "moreover , assuming that the composition is almost at its heaviest already at 50 eev would make it more difficult to account for the the fact that the highest energy events are not within the ta s hotspot while their number is also clearly in excess with respect to the auger data . in the same line of reasoning ,",
    "let us note that if the presence of a hotspot in ta dataset is confirmed with larger statistics , the study of the energy evolution of its significance will be critical in order to constrain the source composition and especially the presence of protons at lower energy .",
    "indeed , @xcite , pointed out that a cluster of events due to cosmic - rays nuclei with charge @xmath29 above an energy @xmath130 , implies a clustering of uhecrs with the same rigidity but lower @xmath29 at the same spot .",
    "the statistical significance of the lower energy enhancement depends on the details of the source composition and spectra .",
    "we encourage the ta collaboration to search for such an enhancement and report on its existence or lack of .    concerning the spectral shape at the source",
    ", we do not expect other types of assumptions to modify strongly our conclusions , first because we did show that these allow to reproduce fairly well the auger spectrum for the vast majority of the simulated data sets , which should probably be a common feature of most working scenarios , and second because we actually based our comparison with the data on the integrated spectrum above 50  eev , which does not depend much on the actual shape of the high energy end of the spectrum . finally ,",
    "concerning the distribution of intrinsic luminosities among sources , it should be acknowledged that , as long as the uhecr sources are not known , and the acceleration process is not identify , one can not make any reliable statement about it .",
    "we assumed the luminosity distribution resulting from the grb source model .",
    "however , scenarios based on standard candles or on the contrary with a much wider luminosity distribution are in principle possible . from the point of view of producing a strongly dominating source ,",
    "our assumptions lead a larger variance in the observed spectra than the standard candle scenario for a given inferred source density .",
    "now , if the luminosity distribution were actually larger , it would increase the cosmic variance , with some realisations having their closest source particularly bright , or on the contrary only weak sources among the most nearby ones .",
    "this , however , would generally not produce an effect very different from what could be expected in the case of a lower source density , where fewer sources contributing a larger flux individually . to explore this",
    ", we also tested a source scenario with a source density of @xmath182 , with 6000 additional data sets for two values of the extragalactic magnetic field .",
    "less than 10 of those passed our flux criterion together with either of the two anisotropy criteria ( 2-point correlation function or clustering ) , but _",
    "none _ passed the three criteria . in conclusion",
    ", we think that our results are relatively robust to possible changes in the astrophysical assumptions regarding the sources .",
    "we note that the transient sources considered in this paper have been assumed to emit uhecrs isotropically , although a beamed emission is probable .",
    "as we pointed earlier the isotropic assumption adopted here is in fact optimistic in term of the probability to produce a significant flux excess since beamed sources would be more numerous , have smaller intrinsic luminosities and any angular spreading in the vicinity of the sources would reduce the effective flux emitted in the direction of the observer , and thus reduce the probability of a large flux excess .",
    "another specificity of our treatment of transient sources is that we applied an additional time delay in the propagation of the particles as if the sources were located in an environment similar to the that of the sun , assuming a host galaxy with magnetic properties like ours . in principle",
    ", the source might be located in a strongly magnetized environment .",
    "this would further reduce the possibility to observed a large flux excess in the case of transient sources , by implying yet additional time delays .",
    "if these time delays are long enough , it may even turn transient sources into steady sources .",
    "this possibility appears extremely unlikely in a galactic magnetic environment similar to ours ( at least with the galactic magnetic field model we used throughout our study ) because the typical grb rate per galaxy ( @xmath183 , assuming a beaming factor @xmath184 ) is too low for the ultra - high - energy cosmic - ray signal of different grb to significantly overlap in time .",
    "starburst galaxies which are known to harbor much stronger magnetic fields than our own galaxy ( see for instance @xcite for a review ) may appear as a better candidate for such an overlap between successive grbs to take place .",
    "let us note however that this possibility remains at present speculative , since there is no strong established connexion between starburst galaxies and grb explosion in the local universe ( see @xcite for recent accounts ) .    finally , from the point of view of the energy scale , we chose to rescale ta energy scale downward by 13% while we could have equivalently chosen to rescale auger energy scale upward by the same amount .",
    "this choice was dictated both by the fact that auger claimed systematic on the energy scale ( 14% ) is lower than that of ta ( 22% ) and also because at this energy scale the experimental value of @xmath185  eev corresponds quite closely the median value found in our simulations for most of our hypotheses on the extragalactic magnetic field , the rate or density of the sources . by choosing to rescale auger energy scale by 13% upward we",
    "would thus have discussed the excess of events in ta dataset above 57 eev rather than above 50 eev . while it intuitively obvious",
    "that the cosmic variance ( and as a result the probability to observe a significant difference between ta and auger number of events ) is expected to increase with the energy , this effect should be quantitatively minor for a 13% shift in energy , all the more in the case of a composition getting heavier in this energy range . as soon as it remains moderate a global shift of the energy scale should thus not affect significantly our conclusions and appear to be much less relevant than energy dependent systematic errors for our present discussion . since it is precisely the conjunction between a large flux excess and a moderate anisotropy ( the latter being reproduced in @xmath186% of the simulated data sets ) in the northern hemisphere which turned out to be particularly challenging to account for , the discovery of any energy dependent systematic effect allowing to reduce the high energy flux difference between the two hemispheres would alleviate the constraints imposed by current observations .    as conclusion , based on the results presented in this paper ,",
    "it may be considered likely that the current features of the auger and ta data , if confirmed by future observations , may either point towards rather unconventional astrophysical scenarios , or to a very particular situation in the universe , where we happen to be very close to an intense steady source , affected by particularly large magnetic deflections .",
    "additional data , especially with reduced or `` homogeneous '' systematic uncertainties , allowing for a direct comparison between the northern and southern sky , with similar statistics , would definitely be of great help to address this issue .",

    "although the auger - like sky map ( lower panel ) looks indeed compatible with isotropy ( as was indicated by the 2-point correlation function ) , it is interesting to note that the dominant source in the ta sky is also vastly dominant in the auger sky , contributing no less than 124 of the 231 highest energy events .",

    "<S> the telescope array ( ta ) shows a 20@xmath0 hotspot as well as an excess of uhecrs above 50  eev when compared with the auger spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the possibility that both the ta excess and hotspot are due to a dominant source in the northern sky . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out detailed simulations of uhecr propagation in both the intergalactic medium and the galaxy , using different values for the intergalactic magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two general classes of sources : transients and steady , adopting a mixed uhecr composition that is consistent with the one found by auger . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial location of the sources is draw randomly . </S>",
    "<S> we generate auger - like and ta - like data sets from which we determine the spectrum , the sky maps and the level of anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , while steady sources are favoured over transients , the probability to account for all the currently available observational data is very low ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while we reproduce fairly well the auger spectrum for the vast majority of the simulated data sets , most of the simulated data sets with a spectrum compatible with that of ta ( at most a few percent depending on density model tested ) show a much stronger anisotropy than the one observed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rare cases in which both the spectrum and the anisotropy are consistent require a steady source within @xmath2 mpc , to account for the flux excess , and a strong extragalactic magnetic field @xmath2 ng , to reduce the excessive anisotropy . </S>"
