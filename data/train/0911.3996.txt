    "one way to investigate quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low energies is by using effective models - such as the linear sigma model - that possess the same global symmetries as qcd , most notably the chiral @xmath2 symmetry ( with @xmath3 flavours ) . in these effective models",
    "hadronic degrees of freedom , rather than quark and gluon degrees of freedom , are present ; spontaneous breaking of the chiral invariance leads to the emergence of nearly massless pseudoscalar goldstone bosons ( e.g. , pions for @xmath4 ) .",
    "their chiral partners , the scalar states , remain massless .    if the linear sigma model is used , there are at least two possibilities to choose the hadronic degrees of freedom in the corresponding lagrangian : with ( pseudo-)scalar degrees of freedom only , or with the addition of ( axial- ) vector degrees of freedom . in this paper",
    "we present a linear sigma model _ with _ vector and axial - vector mesons for @xmath4 and discuss two important quantities : the @xmath5 scattering lengths and the decay width of @xmath6 ( in our notation : @xmath7 ) into two pions . in particular , we aim to investigate the role of ( axial-)vector mesons for these quantities . to this end",
    "we investigate the limit in which the ( axial-)vector mesons decouple and compare the results with the results of the full model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the model is introduced , in section 3 the results with and without vector mesons are presented and in section 4 we present our conclusions .",
    "the model is described by a @xmath8 chirally symmetric lagrangian @xcite : @xmath9-m_{0}^{2}\\mathrm{tr}(\\phi^{\\dagger}\\phi)-\\lambda_{1}[\\mathrm{tr}% ( \\phi^{\\dagger}\\phi)]^{2}-\\lambda_{2}\\mathrm{tr}(\\phi^{\\dagger}\\phi)^{2}% } \\nonumber\\\\ &   -\\frac{1}{4}\\mathrm{tr}[(l^{\\mu\\nu})^{2}+(r^{\\mu\\nu})^{2}]+\\frac{m_{1}^{2}% } { 2}\\mathrm{tr}[(l^{\\mu})^{2}+(r^{\\mu})^{2}]+\\mathrm{tr}[h(\\phi+\\phi^{\\dagger } ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ &   + c(\\det\\phi+\\det\\phi^{\\dagger})-2ig_{2}(\\mathrm{tr}\\{l_{\\mu\\nu}[l^{\\mu } , l^{\\nu}]\\}+\\mathrm{tr}\\{r_{\\mu\\nu}[r^{\\mu},r^{\\nu}]\\})\\nonumber\\\\ &   + \\frac{h_{1}}{2}\\mathrm{tr}(\\phi^{\\dagger}\\phi)\\mathrm{tr}[(l^{\\mu}% ) ^{2}+(r^{\\mu})^{2}]+h_{2}\\mathrm{tr}[\\vert l^{\\mu}\\phi \\vert ^{2 } + \\vert \\phi r^{\\mu } \\vert ^{2}]\\nonumber\\\\ &   + 2h_{3}\\mathrm{tr}(\\phi r_{\\mu}\\phi^{\\dagger}l^{\\mu})+ ... \\text { , } \\label{lagrangian}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 ( scalar and pseudoscalar degrees of freedom ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( vector and axial - vector degrees of freedom ; our model is currently constructed for @xmath4 - thus , our eta meson @xmath13 contains only non - strange degrees of freedom ) ; @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the generators of @xmath16 ; @xmath17 $ ] ( @xmath18 denotes the photon field ) , @xmath19-(\\partial^{\\nu}l^{\\mu } -iea^{\\nu}[t^{3},l^{\\mu}])$ ] , @xmath20-(\\partial^{\\nu}r^{\\mu}-iea^{\\nu}[t^{3},r^{\\mu}]).$ ] the dots refer to further globally invariant terms which are irrelevant in the following .",

    "the chiral anomaly is described by the term @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "note that the model possesses global chiral invariance ; the reasons to use the global invariance ( instead of the local one ) may be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as refs . @xcite .",
    "the reason to consider operators up to the fourth order only has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    when @xmath24 , spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath25 takes place .",
    "the sigma field is shifted by its ( constant ) vacuum expectation value @xmath26 : @xmath27 as a result of this shift non - diagonal mixing terms of the form @xmath28 and @xmath29 arise . in order to remove them , the fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 are also shifted as @xmath32 , @xmath33 with @xmath34 and the pseudoscalar fields are renormalized : @xmath35 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the identification of mesons with particles listed by the pdg @xcite is straightforward in the pseudoscalar and ( axial-)vector sectors : the fields @xmath38 and @xmath13 correspond to the pion and the @xmath39 counterpart of the @xmath40 meson , @xmath41 ( with a mass @xmath42  of about @xmath43 mev , obtained by unmixing the physical @xmath40 and @xmath44 mesons ) .",
    "the fields @xmath45 , @xmath46 represent the @xmath47 and the @xmath48 vector mesons ; the fields @xmath49 , @xmath50 represent the @xmath51 and @xmath52 axial - vector mesons .",
    "unfortunately , the identification of the @xmath7 and @xmath53 fields is controversial with the possibilities being the pairs @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for the purpose of this paper",
    "we chose the assignment @xmath56 , which allows us to study the decay @xmath57 and the @xmath5  scattering lengths .",
    "eleven parameters are present in the lagrangian : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "using the masses @xmath69 , @xmath42 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the pion decay constant @xmath73 ( via the eq .",
    "@xmath74 ) and the experimentally well - known decay widths @xmath75 mev and @xmath76 mev @xcite , one can eliminate eight parameters .",
    "all quantities of interest can be then expressed in terms of three independent combinations of parameters , which for convenience are chosen to be @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath62 .",
    "explicit expressions and a detailed description of the procedure can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for the present purpose , it is useful to write explicitly the equation for the @xmath79 mass@xmath80 \\label{rhomass}%\\ ] ] where the decomposition of @xmath81 in terms of two terms is evident : the term @xmath82 $ ] represents the contribution of the chiral condensate ( and vanishes in the limit @xmath83 ) , while @xmath84 is independent of the chiral condensate and can be related to the gluon condensate . note that we made explicit that @xmath85 and @xmath86 are functions of @xmath87 in the following we will consider @xmath88 as varying between 0 and @xmath89 :",
    "in fact , a negative @xmath88 would imply that the vacuum is not stable in the limit @xmath90 ; @xmath91 would imply that the contribution of the chiral condensate is negative .",
    "this is counter - intuitive and at odds with various microscopic approaches such as the njl model .",

    "we use the experimental values @xmath96 and @xmath97 from the na48/2 collaboration @xcite and @xmath98 mev @xcite .",
    "a standard fit procedure allows us to determine the parameters @xmath95 , @xmath78 , and @xmath62 and their errors : @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 mev .",
    "obviously , the errors of @xmath62 and @xmath95 are too large .",
    "a drastic improvement can be obtained via a physical consideration : as we discussed after eq .",
    "( [ rhomass ] ) we impose that @xmath84 is varying between @xmath102 and @xmath81 . as a consequence for z=1.67 , the parameter @xmath103 needs to lie in the interval @xmath104\\longleftrightarrow h_{1}=-68_{-15}^{+36}$ ] ( the upper boundary of @xmath62 corresponds to @xmath105 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath95 can be constrained in a similar way using the scattering length @xmath106 : @xmath107 $ ] mev @xmath108 mev .    with these parameter values",
    "it is possible to calculate the @xmath7 decay width , @xmath109 which is shown in the following _ fig .",
    "1_.    the three lower curves in the plot depict the @xmath7 decay width in the model that contains vector and axial - vector degrees of freedom .",
    "it is clear that the decay width becomes smaller when the vector and axial - vector degrees of freedom are introduced . in that case , the value of the @xmath7 decay width changes very slowly with @xmath95 so that even for @xmath110 mev the width is not larger than approximately 300 mev - a value that is too small when compared , e.g. , with the results from refs .",
    "@xcite . note that the value of @xmath110 mev is actually too large to agree with the scattering length @xmath106 ( as apparent from _",
    "2 ) if the ( axial-)vector fields are considered - then , the @xmath7 mass should not be larger than 450 mev which in turn yields a @xmath7 decay width smaller than about 100 mev .",
    "@xmath111 + _ * results without ( axial-)vector mesons : * _ this limit is obtained for @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 , and @xmath114 in this case the decay width @xmath115 and the scattering length @xmath116 are functions of @xmath117 only and are plotted in _ fig . 1 _ and _ fig . 2",
    "_ , respectively .",
    "the scattering length @xmath106 allows for @xmath118 $ ] mev ( see _ fig .",
    "thus , the value of the @xmath6 decay width in this case is _ much larger _ than in the previous cases : given that @xmath119 $ ] mev , one obtains @xmath120 $ ] mev ( see _ fig . 1 _ ) .",
    "these values are in agreement with the result obtained by leutwyler _",
    "( @xmath121 mev ) @xcite and the result @xmath122 mev obtained by pelez _",
    "however , this limit also implies that @xmath123 , which is clearly at odds with experiment @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 model without ( axial-)vector degrees of freedom can properly describe @xmath5 scattering and @xmath6 phenomenology .",
    "this is also one of the reasons for its success in low - energy hadron physics .",
    "however , the inclusion of vector and axial - vector fields drastically worsens the agreement with data : a simultaneous description of both @xmath5 scattering lengths and @xmath57 is no longer possible .",
    "this is due to the fact that a notable decrease in the decay width of the @xmath6 resonance , @xmath124 mev , takes place and due to the important role of the @xmath79 meson in @xmath5 scattering .    in light of these results",
    "one could be led to neglect ( axial-)vector degrees of freedoms .",
    "this is , however , not feasible : vector and axial - vector mesons are well - known quark - antiquark states which should necessarily be part of a realistic low - energy model . neglecting them",
    "would imply that they decouple from the pseudoscalar goldstone bosons , which is obviously at odds with the experimentally measured decay widths @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "a way out of the problem is to change the scenario for scalar mesons by identifying the scalar fields of the model with @xmath55 ( as done - for instance - in refs .",
    "still , a light scalar resonance with mass of about 400 mev is needed to describe @xmath5 scattering : the resonance @xmath6 can be interpreted as an additional tetraquark state . in this way , mixing of tetraquark and quarkonia takes place @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of this possibility and the generalization to @xmath127 ( involving also the scalar glueball ) are possible extensions of the present approach .",
