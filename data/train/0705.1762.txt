    "granular fluids ( gfs ) represent one of the current paradigms of open non - equilibrium systems and , for this reason , in the last two decades have been the subject of a huge amount of experimental , numerical and theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "gfs can be conveniently modeled as assemblies of macroscopic particles , experiencing instantaneous binary collisions during which a fraction of the kinetic energy is dissipated , i.e. , transferred into internal degrees of freedom . under the action of a vigorous external driving force , gfs may appear similar to ordinary molecular fluids , but crucial differences remain because inelasticity leads to the appearance of a series of peculiar behaviors , such as clustering , non - gaussian velocity distribution , and velocity correlations .",
    "these phenomena have no counterparts in molecular fluids and render the study of gfs difficult but particularly fascinating .    in spatially uniform systems , relations have been obtained between static average quantities such as density , kinetic temperature and pressure , which may be regarded as the analogue of the equation of state .",
    "in addition , a granular hydrodynamics has been developed which , due to the inelasticity of collisions , differs nontrivially from standard hydrodynamics .",
    "the majority of these studies focus on large scale properties of the fluid . however , in strongly inhomogeneous systems , the connection between the microscale typical of the particles and the macroscale is still incomplete .",
    "recently , some authors  @xcite have proposed phenomenological theories , based on local mass and momentum conservation laws , incorporating nonideal gas effects via an effective free energy functional suitably designed to describe the spontaneous formation of loosely and densely packed regions .",
    "this approach sounds very appealing because the free energy density functional  @xcite , besides being a method computationally simple and physically clear , has proven to be a useful tool in the theory of nonuniform fluids with applications to interfacial and freezing phenomena .",
    "the basic assumption of all density functional theories is that the thermodynamic potential of a nonuniform system may be approximated knowing the structural and thermodynamic properties of the corresponding uniform system .",
    "two questions are in order before proceeding to generalize the density functional theory ( dft ) to granular materials : does the same method offer any new insight in this new area ? how far meaningful concepts for standard molecular fluids , such as free energy and chemical potential , can be extended to systems which are not at thermodynamic equilibrium ?",
    "the answer to the second question seems to be desolately negative and therefore in order to construct a theory of nonuniform gf , alternative techniques not involving free energy functional derivations have to be developed . a step towards this new direction has been recently made and an equation of evolution for the particle density was obtained in the case of nonequilibrium colloidal systems  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , such an equation is very similar to the equation considered within the dynamic density functional method  @xcite .",
    "it differs from the latter only for the presence of some higher order corrections .",
    "the derivation of ref .",
    "@xcite employs standard tools of kinetic theory and in particular the revised enskog equation  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we generalize such an approach to fluids of inelastic hard core particles subject to a stochastic forcing .",
    "we consider a one dimensional model of granular fluid which is simple enough as to lend itself to analytic work , but is endowed with a sufficient complexity as to display inhomogeneous behavior  @xcite .",
    "one dimensional models may play a useful role since they can be employed to test approximations of more general applicability and allow us to link easily the structural properties to the dynamical behavior .",
    "moreover , at equilibrium the qualitative differences between one dimension and higher dimensions appear in the development of long - range ordering or any kind of phase transitions , but not in the short - range packing structure . in the collision kinetics ,",
    "the qualitative difference between one dimension and higher dimensions appears in purely inertial and elastic systems through the conservation of the velocity distributions despite the collisions .",
    "the role of the bath , and also the inelastic collisions , kills the peculiarity of the one dimensional case .",
    "a basic feature of this work is the assumption of a uniform thermostat to describe the external energy supply .",
    "the balance between thermostatting and dissipation mechanism gives rise to nonequilibrium steady states which are achieved without fine tuning of the model parameters .",
    "few kinds of thermostats have been employed in the literature , namely , the white noise thermostat  @xcite , the gaussian thermostat  @xcite and the langevin thermostat  @xcite which includes both the white noise term and the friction force proportional to the velocity of the particles  @xcite .",
    "the present study is based on the langevin thermostat because it can be easily realized in numerical experiments and lends itself to a great deal of analytical work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we introduce the equations describing the dynamics of the stochastically driven inelastic hard - rod fluid model .",
    "we start from the stochastic equations for the trajectories of each particle and discuss how these can be reduced under some suitable approximations to the fokker - planck - boltzmann equation for the single - particle phase - space distribution .",
    "next , in order to make analytical progress , we separate the velocity and the spatial dependence of the distribution function and obtain an infinite hierarchy of coupled integro - differential equations . in sec .",
    "[ homogeneous ] we analyze the steady state uniform properties of the system . in sec .",
    "[ evolution ] we introduce the evolution equation for the density of the system , which is obtained in appendix a by applying the multiple time scale method , and in sec .",
    "[ applications ] we perform a series of numerical tests of our theory using a few selected examples .",
    "the tests compare the two levels of description : the results obtained studying the single particle trajectories with those obtained from the density equation .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",

    "the sum over @xmath29 is the analogue in @xmath30 of the integration over the d - dimensional surface of the hyper - sphere with radius @xmath2 .",
    "the ret embodies spatial correlations through the hard - rod pair correlation function , @xmath31 evaluated at contact . as a simplifying approximation , to obtain a theory at the level of the one - particle distribution ,",

    "the evolution of all remaining partial amplitudes @xmath55 , ( @xmath94 ) could be deduced from the knowledge of @xmath93 .",
    "physically , the reason for such a complexity reduction can be attributed to the fact that the marginal velocity probability distribution attains its local equilibrium rapidly , in a time span of the order of @xmath92 , during which the one - particle density changes slowly .",

    "we study , now , the stationary profile induced by a static periodic external potential of the form @xmath164 for moderate values of the bulk packing fraction the asymptotic value of the induced density profile turns out to be modulated with the same period as the potential . the height of the peaks is lower than the corresponding height of the non - interacting case , because the hard - core repulsion tends to smear the particles over the wells away from the minimum energy configuration . on the other hand , one can appreciate a difference between the elastic and the inelastic case .",

    "@xmath169 , we observe a linear growth of this quantity , which is well described by the diffusive law , @xmath170 . in agreement with our analytical prediction of sec .",
    "vi , the coefficient @xmath171 is a growing function of the coefficient of restitution and of the number of particles .",
    "the first effect can be interpreted by noticing that smaller values of @xmath3 correspond to larger dissipation and thus to lower local kinetic temperatures . since one expects @xmath171 to be proportional to the ratio between temperature and friction coefficient a lowering of the kinetic temperature determines a decrease of the spreading . on the other hand",

    "broken lines represent the theoretical predictions and the symbols the simulations results obtained as an average over @xmath174 independent runs . ]    finally , we consider the escape process of a group of particles from a well of the sinusoidal potential .",

    "figure  [ fig : escape ] reports the log - log plot of decay in time of @xmath175 , obtained by averaging over @xmath174 independent runs , for different well widths @xmath176 . for comparison",
    "we also show the corresponding quantity computed through the ddft ( dashed lines ) which correctly reproduces the dynamical features of the escape process .",
    "we see that the rate at which particles exit the original well decreases with @xmath176 , because the particles spend more time in that well .",
    "the collisionless particle systems generally displays a longer escape time than interacting systems , because the absence of excluded volume effects does not entail an effective reduction of the depth of the potential well , which , instead , is the relevant feature characterizing the escape experiments involving hard core particles .",
    "the inelasticity , on the other hand , tends to decrease the escape rate due to the energy loss caused by collisions , but this does not counterbalance the excluded volume effect so that the rate of the inelastic particles remains faster than the corresponding rate of the collisionless model .",
    "in this paper we have derived a method to study the dynamics of an assembly of particles interacting inelastically , and driven by a stochastic thermostat .",
    "we have found that the particles adopt spatial configurations which are very close to those of an equilibrium system , in spite of the fact that our system is driven and dissipative .",
    "the reason for such a similarity is twofold as suggested by a recent study of reis et al .",
    "@xcite : the homogeneous energy feeding mechanism and the importance of the repulsive forces .",
    "however , the present work shows that there is no need to invoke entropic forces to explain the observed inhomogeneities .",
    "a kinetic approach , in which the short range repulsion is suitably accounted for by means of a suitable treatment of spatial correlations , predicts fairly well the observed structural properties  @xcite .",
    "our theory indicates that the steady state configurations occur not as a result of the minimization of some hypothetical coarse grained free energy functional but as a result of the competition between the uniform energy injection and the energy dissipation .",
    "these two effects are described by an enskog collision operator and by a a fokker - planck collision operator , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the phase space distribution function is thus governed by a fokker - planck - enskog ( fpe ) equation , whose solution still remains an extremely difficult task for dense fluids due to the complexity of the collision kernel and to the computer resources needed to resolve the distribution function .",
    "however , when the friction is sufficiently high one can derive a simpler description by an iterative elimination of the fast degrees of freedom , such as the velocities of the particles .",
    "such a procedure is based on the intuition that these achieve locally their equilibrium distribution , whereas the positions evolve more slowly .",
    "truncating this iteration at the first order in the inverse friction parameter @xmath95 is equivalent to approximating the velocity distribution functions by maxwellians at temperatures equal to that of the heat bath .",
    "further terms , associated with non maxwellian contributions to the velocity distribution function , are included in the expansion and contribute to the evolution .",
    "the result is a self - consistent time dependent equation for the local density , where the `` internal field '' is determined by the density itself either through the standard hard - rod entropic contribution or by the velocity and energy currents generated by spatial density gradients .    at a technical level eq .",
    "( [ psi0timeb ] ) is derived by applying a multiple time - scale method to the fokker - planck - enskog equation .",
    "the resulting equation bears a strong similarity with the dynamic density functional equation , but it is not based on the notion of coarse grained free energy , a concept which can not be applied to open non equilibrium systems , such as the inelastic fluid we have studied in this work . equation  ( [ psi0timeb ] ) is a density functional equation for the density field @xmath103 where its evolution depends on a functional of @xmath99 itself and its derivatives .",
    "it is local in time , but does not possess a generating liapunov functional , therefore , we can not prove that the associated dynamics minimizes some cost function .",
    "in more detail we have found that :    \\a ) the inelasticity induces changes even in the stationary properties of the fluid with respect to the elastic reference system to order @xmath95 .",
    "the changes can be observed both in the velocity distribution and in the structure of the non uniform fluid .",

    "\\c ) the theory holds in the region @xmath177 , when the typical time - scale of the heat bath is shorter than the enskog collision frequency .",
    "as far as future perspectives are concerned the method can be generalized to higher dimensions and different types of inter - particle forces and to systems with a non uniform distribution of heat sources @xcite .",
    "a second type of generalization consists in performing the same multiscale expansion at the level of the two particle phase - space distribution function , by truncating the bbgky hierarchy one step further , which would allow us to compute self - consistently the pair correlation function of the system .",
