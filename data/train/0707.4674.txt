    "recent developments in techniques for fabricating conducting graphene layers @xcite have provided the physics community with a unique opportunity to study an interacting two - dimensional ( 2d ) massless dirac fermion system .",
    "this has led to considerable experimental and theoretical activity in this field @xcite .",
    "the band structure of graphene , by dint of its honeycomb lattice , has linear dispersions near the k and k@xmath0 points of the brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the corresponding kinetic energy of graphene for 2d wave vector * k * is given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 indicate the conduction ( + 1 ) and valence ( @xmath3 ) bands , respectively , and @xmath4 is a band parameter ( and fermi velocity of graphene is given by @xmath5 ) .",
    "the corresponding density of states ( dos ) is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the spin and valley degeneracies , respectively . the fermi momentum ( @xmath9 ) and the fermi energy ( @xmath10 ) of 2d graphene are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the 2d carrier ( electron or hole ) density .",
    "many electronic properties of a system are strongly influenced by the presence of electron - electron interaction . in this paper , we investigate theoretically the electron - electron interaction induced exchange - correlation effects in two dimensional graphene layer .",
    "we calculate , within the leading - order dynamical - screening approximation , the electron self - energy for extrinsic graphene at zero temperature .",
    "the self energy is the central quantity that determines the other fermi liquid parameters .",
    "we obtain the single particle spectral function and the inelastic quasiparticle lifetimes and associated mean free paths from the calculated electron self - energy .",
    "the self - energy is given by in the screened interaction ( @xmath14 approximation ) @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 denote the band indices , @xmath18 is the unperturbed green s function ( @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the chemical potential ) , @xmath21 is the bare coulomb potential ( with background dielectric constant @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 is the dynamical screening function ( dielectric function ) given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , the 2d polarizability , is given by the bare bubble diagram @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) @xmath26 is the overlap of states , given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the angle between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    after the standard procedure of analytical continuation , the self - energy can be separated into the exchange and correlation parts @xmath31 the exchange part is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fermi function at @xmath34 .",
    "the correlation part , @xmath35 , is defined to be the part of @xmath36 not included in @xmath37 . since the exchange part of self - energy @xmath38 is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite we provide in this paper the results of correlation part . in the gw approximation",
    ", the @xmath39 can be written in the line and pole decomposition @xmath40 , where @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath42 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & v_c({\\bf q})f_{ss'}({\\bf k , k+q } ) \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(q,\\xi_{{\\bf k+q},s'})}-1 \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath43 is completely real because @xmath44 is real .",
    "thus , im[@xmath45 gives the total contribution to the imaginary part of the self - energy . in this calculation",
    "we use the cut - off at the wave vector @xmath46 with respect to the dirac point ; _ i.e. _ , the integral is cut off at @xmath47 . from the calculated self energy @xmath48 ,",
    "we can obtain the single - particle spectral function given by     and ( b ) spectral function @xmath49 as a function of the energy @xmath50 for @xmath51 ( the dirac point ) . ]",
    "@xmath52 } { \\left \\ {      \\omega+\\mu-\\xi_k-{\\rm re}[\\sigma(k,\\omega ) ] \\right \\}^2 + \\left \\ { { \\rm          im}[\\sigma(k,\\omega ) ] \\right \\}^2}.\\ ] ]    the spectral function @xmath49 satisfies the sum rule @xmath53 which is generally satisfied to within less than a percent in our numerical calculations .",
    "in figs . 1 and 2 we show the real and the imaginary parts of the self - energy and spectral function for @xmath51 ( the dirac point ) and @xmath54 ( fermi surface ) .",
    "throughout this paper we use the following parameters : dielectric constant @xmath55 , fermi velocity @xmath56 @xmath57 , and cut - off momentum @xmath58 , where @xmath59  is the lattice constant of graphene .     and ( b ) spectral function @xmath49 as a function of the energy @xmath50 for @xmath54 ( at the fermi surface ) . the vertical arrow in ( b ) denote @xmath60-function in the spectral function of weight ( @xmath61 ) at @xmath62 . ]    for @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "1 ) we find a strong peak in im[@xmath48 ] ( associated with a finite step in re[@xmath48 ] ) due to plasmon emission .",
    "since im[@xmath64 is finite for all energies except @xmath62 we expect a finite damping in the spectral function . in spectral function",
    "we find two peaks .",
    "the first peak ( from @xmath62 ) in @xmath49 corresponds to the usual quasiparticle ( i.e. a bare particle surrounded by a cloud of virtual plasmons and particle - hole excitations ) , and the second peak corresponds to a plasmaron , which is interpreted as a hole coupled to a cloud of real plasmons @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the self - energy and spectral function for the fermi wave vector ( @xmath54 ) . in particular , the behavior of the self - energy and spectral function at @xmath54 determines the low - energy properties of the system . for @xmath54",
    "there is only one peak in @xmath49 at @xmath62 , which is a @xmath60-function peak because im@xmath65 as @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "thus , the doped ( or gated ) graphene is a fermi liquid because it possesses a fermi surface ( or a discontinuity in momentum distribution function ) whose presence is indicated by a @xmath60 function in @xmath67 at @xmath62 ( or , equivalently , non - zero many - body renormalization factor ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we show a quasiparticle lifetime due to electron  electron interactions , which is given by @xmath68 $ ] . since the velocity of the quasiparticles close the the dirac points",
    "is approximately a constant , the inelastic mean free path @xmath69 is obtained by @xmath70 . in inset of fig .  3",
    ", we provide the corresponding @xmath69 , which shows that at @xmath71 a hot electron injected with an energy of 1ev above @xmath10 has an @xmath69 due to electron ",
    "electron interactions that is on the order of 20 nm .",
    "this will have implications for designing any hot electron transistor type graphene devices .",
    "note that the calculate scattering time is a smooth function because both plasmon emission and interband processes are absent .",
    "in parabolic band semiconductors @xcite plasmon emission and interband collision thresholds cause discontinuities in the scattering time .",
    ", in graphene due to dynamically screened electron  electron interactions , as a function of energy at @xmath34 for different densities .",
    "inset shows the corresponding quasiparticle mean free path for @xmath72 @xmath73 . ]",
    "in summary , we calculate the electron - electron interaction induced quasiparticle self - energy in graphene layer within the leading - order dynamical - screening approximation .",
    "our calculated spectral function indicates that the extrinsic graphene ( i.e. @xmath74 ) is a fermi liquid .",
    "we also calculate hot carrier inelastic scattering due to electron - electron interactions . the linear dispersion and chiral property of graphene give lifetime energy dependences that are qualitatively different from those of parabolic - band semiconductors .",
    "we can apply our calculated self - energy to obtain other quasi - particle properties of graphene ."
