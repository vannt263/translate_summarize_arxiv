    "( [ eqn : hm ] ) , @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the average number per site of particles with spin @xmath30 in the ground state.@xcite here we consider the paramagnetic state at half - filling @xmath173 and set @xmath174 assuming that @xmath6 is large . when the spectral weight @xmath175 is dominated by single pole of dispersion @xmath176 , the green s function is given by @xmath177 where @xmath178 in @xmath168 is canceled by @xmath28 .",
    "the poles of this green s function are @xmath179 for @xmath180 , therefore the original band @xmath167 splits into the upper and lower hubbard bands ( of almost equal weights ) with a gap of width @xmath6 .",
    "[ fig : sp - u5 - 7v2 ] shows the spectral functions @xmath181 and @xmath182 calculated on 12d cluster with @xmath183 at @xmath184 for ( a ) ( b ) @xmath130 , ( c ) ( d ) @xmath185 , and ( e ) ( f ) @xmath186 , assuming that no magnetic order is allowed .",
    "the non - interacting band is plotted with the full lines . at @xmath187 , which is slightly below the mott transition point",
    ", small weights appear in @xmath182 whenever the non - interacting band ( full line ) crosses the fermi energy , as is seen in ( f ) . at @xmath188 , which is slightly above the mott transition point ,",
    "these weights grows and begins to form single dispersion in ( d ) .",
    "corresponding to this growth of the weights in @xmath182 at the fermi surface , a small gap opens at the fermi surface in @xmath181 in ( c ) .",
    "in fact , as was calculated in fig .  [",
    "fig : order - tp ] ( b ) , a small insulating gap opens simultaneously all over the whole fermi surface at @xmath185 .",
    "as @xmath6 increases further , this dispersion dominates in @xmath182 as is shown in ( b ) , and yields the splitting of the non - interacting band into the upper and lower hubbard band in ( a ) .",

    "mott transition takes place there , and this non - magnetic insulator become magnetic state at @xmath24 . around @xmath5 , magnetic state ( afc or spiral ) is realized above the paramagnetic metal , and it changes to non - magnetic states as @xmath6 increases .",
    "the detailed comparisons of our results with those of the previous vca study@xcite on the isotropic triangular lattice ( @xmath17 ) indicate that the main features of our phase diagram fig .",
