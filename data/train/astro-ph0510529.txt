    "the exact spectral type of this object is a9p ( srcreu subclass ) .",
    "the magnetic field of @xmath1 equ has been studied for more than 50 years , starting from october 1946 ( see babcock 1958 ) .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 of this star does not exhibit periodic variations in time scales typical of stellar rotation , @xmath6 days .",
    "such a variability of the @xmath0 field was observed in most ap stars .",
    "the above effect is commonly interpreted as the result of stellar rotation ( oblique dipole model ) .",
    "the first measurements by babcock ( 1958 ) showed that the value of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 of @xmath1 equ was positive in 194652 , and approached nine hundred g. from that time on the value of @xmath0 slowly decreased and even changed sign in 1970/71 .",
    "one could interpret the magnetic behavior of @xmath1 equ either as secular variations , or variations caused by extremely slow rotation .",
    "if the latter picture is correct , then the corresponding magnetic and rotational periods are in the range from 72 to 110 years ( bonsack & pilachowski 1974 ; leroy et al .",

    "we included in this paper our unpublished magnetic @xmath0 measurements which were obtained during the past seven years .",
    "all the new magnetic observations showed , that the slow decrease of the @xmath0 field in @xmath1 equ apparently reached the minimum in 19962002 and has actually started to increase .",
    "in this paper we determined the accurate parameters of secular variability of @xmath1 equ : the period @xmath7 , the amplitude and the time of zero phase for @xmath0 variations , which were approximated by a sine wave .",
    "we support the hypothesis that the long - term @xmath0 variation in @xmath1 equ is a periodic feature .",
    "possible origin of this variation can not be uniquely determined , see discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] of this paper .",
    "we have performed spectropolarimetric observations of zeeman line splitting for @xmath1 equ at the coude focus of the 1-m optical telescope ( special astrophysical observatory , russian academy of sciences ) .",
    "zeeman spectra were obtained with the echelle spectrograph gecs ( musaev 1996 ) . we have put the achromatic analyser of circularly polarised light in front of the spectrometer slit .",
    "images of the zeeman echelle spectra were recorded from ccd detectors in standard fits format .",

    "on average , the value of a single @xmath0 number listed in table  [ tab : saores ] was obtained after averaging of @xmath0 measurements obtained in 500 - 1300 spectral lines .",
    "standard deviation @xmath10 for the resulting value of @xmath0 was computed in the standard manner as the error of an arithmetic mean value .",
    "errors @xmath10 determined in the above way reached rather low values in several observations listed in table  [ tab : saores ] . in 2005/2006 we plan to verify the reality of such @xmath10 by a special program of @xmath0 observations .",
    "actually we accept these errors _ bona fide _ and note the following properties of our @xmath0 measurements .",
    "the referee pointed out that a few pairs of @xmath0 measurements of one night in table  [ tab : saores ] differ by only a few g , which is substantially less than the corresponding standard deviation @xmath10 .",
    "we can explain this only as a purely random effect , and do not see any reason for it either in the acquisition of observational data or their reduction .",
    "secondly , series of measurements taken within a few nights generally show a scatter of the order of 100 g , which is much higher than the standard errors @xmath10 in table  [ tab : saores ] .",
    "the latter are of the order of @xmath11 g , and such a discrepancy suggests that our standard deviations are systematically underestimated , and are in fact of the order of 100 g. on the other hand , such a scatter of @xmath12 100 g is not inconsistent with the short - term variability of light and the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 in @xmath1 equ in time scales of minutes or above it .",

    "we can not judge , whether an apparent scatter of @xmath0 points in fig .",
    "[ tab : saores ] is due to unrealistic error estimates or the intrinsic short - term variability of the longitudinal magnetic field in @xmath1 equ .",
    "the estimated random error of @xmath0 points about the starting sine wave equals to 213 g. for the final fitting of a sine we assumed that all the 298 points have identical errors of 213 g.    final values of the fitted parameters and their standard deviations @xmath24 for the sine phase curve are given below .",

    "the effect of inhomogeneity in the @xmath0 time series plus the possible existence of rapid magnetic variability in @xmath1 equ were compensated by the increase of the random error , and neither should influence the above parameters of secular magnetic variability in @xmath1 equ .",

    "such a search for peaks in the @xmath0 amplitude spectrum of @xmath1 equ in this paper was restricted to trial periods higher than 1 day .",
    "this is because many of the earlier magnetic observations for this star either have poorly determined the time of measurement , or have long times of exposure ( see e.g. babcock 1958 ) .",
    "the star @xmath1 equ exhibits rapid nonradial pulsations and the corresponding @xmath0 with the period @xmath41 min ( leone & kurtz 2003 ) and , possibly , with simultaneous shorter periods ( bychkov et al .",

    "80 g. the period @xmath47 is close to 1 year .",
    "since most of the existing @xmath0 observations for @xmath1 equ were performed in months july - november , then the peak @xmath47 in the amplitude spectrum represents a false period which most likely reflects the average 1-year repetition time in the acquisition of the existing magnetic measurements .",
    "we believe that the peak @xmath48 in the amplitude spectrum of the @xmath0 field of @xmath1 equ is the random effect of a pure noise .",
    "the peak is very narrow , in fact , it only appears in a single bin of a very dense discrete frequency mesh .",

    "one can assume , that the gravitational force from the secondary companion can cause precession of the ap star .",
    "as the result , the angle between the rotational axis and the direction towards the earth varies periodically .",
    "therefore , changes of the aspect can in principle cause apparent variations of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 or the amplitude of its variations",
    ".    effects of precession in long - period ap stars were studied by lehmann ( 1987 ) , who showed that the oblateness of stars caused by the rotational or magnetic flattening is not adequate to produce observable precession effects .",
    "the only exception was 52 her , where the observed behavior of the star could be interpreted as a precessional motion .",
    "the above considerations indicate that the precession theory does not convincingly explain @xmath0 variations in this star .",
    "the idea by krause & scholz ( 1981 ) that we actually observe the solar - like magnetic cycle in @xmath1 equ in which the global magnetic field reverses its polarity , can not be easily verified by the existing observations of the global longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , one can note that such an idea requires the existence of a mechanism in the interior of @xmath1 equ which ensures the transfer of huge magnetic energy into electric currents and vice versa .",
    "note that the required efficiency of such a mechanism and the amplitude of magnetic field variations in @xmath1 equ is ca .",
    "four orders of magnitude larger than that in the sun in a similar timescale .    following the widely accepted picture of an ap star ,",
    "we believe that the magnetic field of @xmath1 equ can be approximated by a dipole located in the center of the star .",
    "the dipole is inclined to the rotational axis of @xmath1 equ .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is stable and remains frozen in the interior of a rotating star at the time of observations , i.e. during at least of 58 years .",
    "therefore , slow variations of the @xmath0 field in @xmath1 equ are caused by an extremely slow rotation , in which case our @xmath51 .",
    "such an explanation is supported to some extent by polarimetric measurements by leroy et al .",

    "the device was constructed to measure the angles and the degree of linear polarisation of stellar radiation , and will be operational at the special astrophysical observatory in 2006 .",
    "we also expect that shall be able to verify the extremely slow rotation of @xmath1 equ measuring the rate of change for the polarisation angle of stellar radiation .",
    "the ap star @xmath1 equ ( hd 201601 ) exhibited slow and systematic decrease of the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 starting from 1946 , when the global magnetic field of this star was discovered ( babcock 1958 ) .",

    "the latter magnetic data ( 33 @xmath0 points ) were measured with the echelle spectrograph in the coude focus of the 1-m telescope at the special astrophysical observatory .",
    "our newest observations showed that the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 of @xmath1 equ reached its local minimum and started to rise in 1998 - 2004 .",
    "all the available data cover the time period of 58 years ( 1946 - 2004 ) and include both phases of the maximum and minimum @xmath0 . assuming that the secular variability of the @xmath0 field is a periodic feature , we determined parameters of the magnetic field curve in @xmath1 equ and give the value of its period , @xmath52 years , with the zero phase ( maximum of @xmath0 ) at @xmath53 jd @xmath54 .",
    "sine - wave fit to the @xmath0 phase curve yields @xmath55 g and @xmath56 g.    spectral analysis of the 58-year long @xmath0 time series essentially do not show the existence of shorter periods , down to trial periods of @xmath12 1 day .",
