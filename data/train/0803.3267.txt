    "the number of independent observables of a quantum system with the hilbert space dimension @xmath0 is @xmath1 . in many - body systems ,",
    "when @xmath0 increases exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom , that large number of observables can be neither measured nor calculated .",
    "only a limited number of dynamical variables is accessible to an experimentalist , while all the uncontrollable parameters are averaged out .",
    "this means that generically , an observed quantum system is characterized by a small number of the expectation values of accessible observables . to theoretically characterize the dynamics of a quantum system",
    "it is desirable : ( i ) to find equations of motion for this reduced set of expectation values ; ( ii ) to be able to solve the associated equations of motion efficiently .",
    "a computational cost of a direct quantum simulation scales as @xmath2 , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a simulation is defined as efficient if the corresponding equations of motion can be solved with a computational cost which is reduced substantially from that number .    in the present study",
    "we explore the possibility of an efficient simulation of a restricted set of observables , using a novel paradigm for the simulation . assuming that the set of experimentally accessible observables is small , it is plausible that there exist a number of microscopic theories , leading to the same observed dynamics .",
    "if a microscopic theory can be found , which leads to equations of motion that can be solved efficiently , the dynamics of the restricted set of observables can be efficiently simulated .",
    "more specifically , we propose to simulate the unitary dynamics of a quantum system by embedding it in a particular _ open system _ dynamics . in this",
    "dynamics the coupling to the bath is constructed to have a negligible impact on the evolution of the selected set of observables on the characteristic time scale of their _ unitary _ evolution .",
    "the key point is that the resulting open system dynamics can be efficiently simulated .",
    "the reduction of the computational complexity of the evolution , imposed by the bath , is attributed to dynamical coarse - graining , collapsing the system to a preselected representation which is used as the basis for the dynamical description .",
    "since the bath has no observable effect by construction it should be considered solely as a computational tool .",
    "for that reason a term _ fictitious bath _ is used in the paper to refer to it .",
    "the quantum systems considered in the present work have finite hilbert space dimension .",
    "the dynamics is generated by the lie - algebraic hamiltonians : @xmath4 where the set @xmath5 of observables is closed under the commutation relations : @xmath6=i \\sum_{k=1}^k   f_{ijk}{{{\\mathrm{\\hat{x}}}}}_k , \\label{commutation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. , it forms the spectrum - generating @xcite lie algebra @xcite of the system .",

    "lie algebras considered in the present work are compact semisimple algebras @xcite and the basis @xmath5 is assumed to be orthonormal with respect to the killing form @xcite .",
    "the corresponding open system dynamics , which is alleged to simulate the unitary dynamics of the elements of @xmath7 , is governed by the following liouville - von neumann equation of motion @xmath8-\\gamma \\sum_{j=1}^k   \\left[{{{\\mathrm{\\hat{x}}}}}_j,\\left[{{{\\mathrm{\\hat{x}}}}}_j,{{{\\mathrm{\\hat{\\rho } } } } } \\right]\\right ] , \\label{liouville}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has the lindblad form @xcite , i.e. , it describes a markovian completely positive @xcite nonunitary evolution of the quantum system .",
    "the physical interpretation of the evolution , governed by eq.([liouville ] ) is the process of weak measurements @xcite of the algebra of observables @xmath7 , performed on the quantum system , evolving under the hamiltonian ( [ laham ] ) .",
    "the foundation of the method is the observation that coupling to the bath induces a decoherence of the evolving density operator in a particular basis known as generalized coherent states ( gcs ) , associated with the algebra ( section ii ) .",
    "it is shown that if the hamiltonian is linear in @xmath9 and a certain `` classicality condition '' is satisfied by the hilbert space representation of the algebra , the decoherence time - scale is much shorter than the timescale on which the effect of the bath on the elements of @xmath7 is measurable , i.e. , the relaxation time - scale .",
    "it is conjectured that this strong time separation will also hold for hamiltonians bilinear in the elements of @xmath7 ( section iii ) .",
    "we propose to take advantage of this property of the open system dynamics for efficient simulation of the _ unitary _ evolution of @xmath5 , using stochastic unravelings of the evolution @xcite and representing the evolving stochastic pure state in the time - depending basis of the gcs @xcite ( section iv ) .",
    "the effect of the decoherence translates into localization of evolving stochastic pure state in the gcs basis , which enables efficient representation and simulation of the stochastic evolution .",
    "averaging over the unravelings recovers the unitary dynamics of the algebra generators .",
    "it is shown that the averaging can be performed efficiently provided the corresponding dynamics can be efficiently measured in the lab .",
    "the effect of coupling to the fictitious bath is illustrated by the dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a double - well trap @xcite modeled by the two - mode bose - hubbard hamiltonian ( section v ) .",
    "it is demonstrated that the bath induces drastic localization on the level of a stochastic pure - state evolution , while having no observed effect on the dynamics of the elements of the spectrum - generating algebra of the system .",
    "a central theme in this section is the intimate relation between the evolution of the subalgebra of observables and the dynamics of the generalized coherent states ( gcs ) associated with this subalgebra .",

    "the novel strategy for efficient simulation of a unitary evolution of a restricted set of observables has been outlined ( cf .",
    "the restricted set comprises the spectrum - generating lie - algebra of the system .",
    "the unitary evolution of the observables is simulated by a particular open - system dynamics , corresponding to the process of weak measurement of the observables , performed on the evolving quantum system .",
    "the scheme is based on a large time - scales separation between the decoherence of the evolving state in the basis of the generalized coherent states ( gcs ) , associated with the algebra , and the relaxation of the elements of the algebra .",
    "the necessary condition for the successful implementation of the algorithm is the `` classicality '' condition on the spectrum - generating algebra and its hilbert space representation .",

    "the `` classicality '' condition excludes efficient simulation of certain subalgebras of observables ( appendix b ) .",
    "for example , the unitary dynamics of local observables of a composite system of qubits can not be simulated with higher efficiency by the open - system evolution .",
    "the fast decoherence reduces the computational complexity of the evolution , while the slow relaxation leaves the dynamics of the restricted set of observables practically unaffected on physically interesting time - scales .",

    "this coarse - graining can be seen as a generalization of the process of conversion of quantum correlations ( entanglement ) to classical correlations under the action of local dephasing environments @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the computational complexity is realized by simulating the stochastic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( snlse ) , governing the stochastic unraveling of the nonunitary evolution .",

    "this fine - tuned bath is constructed as a computational tool . on the other hand ,",
    "if the fine - tuning condition is dropped , the resulting open - system dynamics can represent a real physical situation , where the linear part of the hamiltonian is perturbed by the time - dependent @xmath156-correlated noise @xcite .",
    "in that case the density operator of the system will follow an open evolution , corresponding to a process of weak measurement of the algebra elements , performed with generally different rates @xcite .",
    "it is expected , that if the noise is sufficiently weak , the constant part of the hamiltonian will induce fast ( on the relaxation time - scale ) rotation in the hilbert - schmidt operator space , which effectively will average out the difference between the contributions of various measurements .",
    "therefore , this real bath is expected to induce the same type of localization as the fine - tuned fictitious bath .",
    "numerical evidence obtained in the @xmath120 case supports this conjecture @xcite . restricting the measurements to the algebra elements",
    ", the experimentalist will not observe the effect of the bath if the noise is sufficiently small , while measuring the higher order correlations will reveal the nonunitary character of the evolution .",
    "generally , it is expected that the resulting open - system dynamics can be simulated with higher efficiency than the corresponding unitary dynamics , provided the `` classicality '' condition holds .",
    "the main open questions to be addressed are :    * investigation of the effect of nonlinear terms in the hamiltonian ( [ laham ] ) on the relaxation time - scales of the observables in the spectrum - generating algebra in the corresponding fictitious open - system dynamics , eq.([liouville ] ) . * development of an efficient and convergent algorithm for simulating the evolution of a state in the gcs basis representation . * a rigorous proof of the conjecture , that for lie - algebraic hamiltonians , bilinear in the generators , eq.([laham ] ) , the generalized purity of the stochastic unraveling of the corresponding open system evolution , eq.([liouville ] ) , is stationary on average and the stationary purity approaches a limiting value independent on the dimension of the hilbert space if the classicality condition becomes stronger .",
