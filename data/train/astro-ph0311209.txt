    "stellar feedback , in the form of ionising radiation and mechanical energy in galactic winds / outflows , plays an important role in determining the physical properties of galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . the galactic contribution to the hydrogen ionising uv radiation",
    "may well exceed that of qsos .",
    "galactic superwinds regulate star formation , enrich the igm with metals , and alter the dynamical and observational properties of the igm close to galaxies .",
    "galactic winds are driven by the mechanical energy produced by supernova explosions of massive stars .",
    "they have been studied extensively in nearby starburst galaxies ( _ e.g. _ heckman 1990 ) .",
    "the large velocity shifts between stellar and interstellar lines in the spectra of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) are strong evidence that galactic winds are also present in high - redshift galaxies ( pettini 1998 , 2000 , heckman 2000 ) .",
    "the inferred wind velocities are several hundred @xmath9 , far above the sound speed of the igm so that strong shocks are likely to be associated with these winds .",
    "these shocks will heat up , collisionally ionise , and sweep up the surrounding igm near galaxies ( heckman 2000 ) .",
    "adelberger ( 2003 , hereafter assp ) have analyzed a sample of high resolution qso spectra with lines - of - sight ( los ) passing very close to lbgs .",
    "they detected a significant decrease of the ly@xmath0  absorption near galaxies .",
    "as discussed by assp and kollmeier et al .",
    "( 2003 ) the increased uv flux close to lbgs falls short of explaining the decreased absorption by a factor of a few .",
    "the decreased absorption is thus taken as evidence for the existence of dilute and highly ionised gas bubbles caused by wind - driven shocks .",
    "initially a shock propagating in the igm expands adiabatically . during this phase",
    "the gas encountered by the shock is heated and collisionally ionised to become part of a bubble of dilute and hot plasma . when radiative losses become important , a thin cool shell forms at the shock front .",
    "the shell is driven outwards by the hot low density inner plasma ( e.g. weaver 1977 , ostriker & mckee 1988 , tegmark 1993 ) .",
    "eventually the expansion of the plasma comes to a halt when pressure equilibrium with the surrounding igm is reached . to explain the lack of  close to the haloes",
    ", the bubble has to survive for a sufficiently long time .",
    "we defer the discussion of the conditions for the survival of the bubble to another paper . here",
    "we assume that the bubbles are long - lived and study the implications of long - lived bubbles devoid of neutral hydrogen on qso absorption spectra .",
    "we will investigate how the correlation between the flux in the ly@xmath0  forest and the distance of the los to the closest galaxy depends on physical properties of the ionised bubbles around galaxies .",
    "for this purpose we use a n - body simulation of collisionless dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the basic observed properties of the ly@xmath0  forest can be reproduced with such simulations using a simple prescription that relates the distribution of gas and dark matter in the igm ( hui & gnedin 1997 ) . with dm simulations it is possible to probe a wider dynamical range than with hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "this allows a better modelling of the statistical properties of the igm - halo relation .",
    "measures of the halo - flux correlation , defined for example as the mean flux in the ly@xmath0  forest as a function of the distance to the nearest galaxies , are sensitive to the size of the bubbles .",
    "absorption spectra probe the gas distribution in redshift space .",
    "thermal motions and coherent peculiar velocities therefore strongly affect the halo - flux correlation at small separations ( e.g. kollmeier 2003 ) .",
    "previous modelling of the impact of winds on the ly@xmath0  forest had difficulties to match the large decrease of the absorption measured by assp at comoving separation @xmath10 from the galaxies ( croft 2002 , bruscoli 2002 , theuns 2002 , kollmeier 2003 ) .",
    "we will investigate here the role of peculiar velocities , thermal motions and the scaling of bubble size with halo mass in more detail .",
    "we will also perform a detailed assessment of the errors to obtain a more robust lower limit on the size and thus the volume filling factor of the bubbles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ lyman ]",
    "we describe the model of the ly@xmath0 forest which we have used to calculate synthetic spectra from the dm simulations . in ",
    "[ nbody ] , we describe the simulation and the corresponding halo catalogs , compute three - dimensional flux maps of the simulation , and discuss the flux probability distribution function and power spectrum in the presence of winds",
    ". the main body of the paper are  [ xihf ] and  [ fluxsim ] where we study in detail the impact of galactic winds on the halo - flux correlation and the corresponding observational errors .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results in  [ discussion ] .",
    "the ly@xmath0  forest is now widely believed to originate from an undulating warm ( @xmath11k ) photoionized igm .",
    "the ly@xmath0  optical depth in redshift space due to resonant scattering can be expressed as a convolution of the real space  density along the line of sight with a voigt profile @xmath12 ( gunn & peterson 1965 , bahcall & salpeter 1965 ) , @xmath13 dx\\ ; . \\label{depth}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the effective cross - section for resonant line scattering and h@xmath15 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the real space coordinate , @xmath18 is the line of sight component of the  peculiar velocity field , @xmath12 is the voigt profile , and @xmath19 is the doppler parameter due to thermal / turbulent broadening . for thermal broadening",
    "@xmath20 , where t is the temperature of the gas .    both @xmath17 and @xmath21",
    "are measured in @xmath9 .",
    "the voigt profile is normalized such that @xmath22 and can be approximated by a gaussian for moderate optical depths , @xmath23 ^ 2/b^2\\right\\}$ ]",
    ".    the normalized flux obtained by `` continuum fitting '' of the observed spectrum is related to the optical depth along the line of sight as , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the optical depth , @xmath21 is the redshift space coordinate along the line of sight , @xmath26 is the observed flux and @xmath27 is the flux emitted from the source ( quasar ) that would be observed in the absence of any intervening material .    on scales larger than a filtering scale which is related to the jeans scale , @xmath28 , the igm traces the dm distribution very well . for moderate overdensities",
    "the balance between adiabatic cooling and photo - heating of the expanding igm establishes power - law relations between temperature , neutral hydrogen density and total gas density ( katz 1996 , hui & gnedin 1997 , theuns 1998 ) , @xmath29 where the parameter @xmath30 is in the range @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the density and temperature of the gas , respectively .    on scales smaller than the jeans scale pressure dominates over gravity .",
    "the gas pressure smoothes the gas distribution compared to the distribution of collisionless dark matter ( _ e.g. _ theuns , schaye & haehnelt 2000 ) .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the dark matter density smoothed in a way that mimics the pressure effects .",
    "we adopt the smoothing used in sph simulations ( e.g. springel , yoshida & white 2001 ) to estimate the gas density from the dark matter particle distribution .",
    "the  density @xmath37 and the smoothed dark matter field @xmath38 are then related as @xmath39^{\\alpha}\\ ; , \\label{neutral}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the ( volume ) average of @xmath38 , and @xmath41 is the  density at @xmath42 .",
    "one of our main goals is to assess the error in the observed galaxy flux correlation .",
    "this requires a simulation large enough to contain a substantial number of dm haloes which can be identified as hosts of lbgs . at the same time",
    "the simulation should still reproduce typical absorption systems .",
    "this favours the use of a dm simulation for which a larger dynamical range can be achieved rather than a computationally more expensive hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "we use a @xmath1cdm simulation run with the n - body code gadget ( springel , yoshida & white 2001 ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "it is part of a series of simulations of increasingly higher resolution which zoom in on a spherical region of initial comoving radius 26@xmath43 selected from a simulation with box size 479@xmath43 ( cf .",
    "stoehr 2002 ) .",
    "the inner region of the simulation has thus higher resolution than the outer regions .",
    "we only use the particle distribution inside a box of size @xmath44 which belongs to the spherical region of high resolution .",
    "the particle mass in this high - resolution region is @xmath45 ( cf .",
    "table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the large volume makes the simulation well suited for a direct comparison with the observed galaxy - flux correlation .",
    "we use a redshift output @xmath46 to facilitate a comparison with the assp measurements .",

    "the smoothed dm density and velocity fields , @xmath38 and @xmath50 , were interpolated for randomly chosen los through the simulation box .",

    "we use the fact that temperature and density are tightly coupled . at moderate densities",
    "a simple power - law relation holds , @xmath58 ( cf .",
    "eq  [ state ] ) . in high - density regions ,",
    "line cooling is efficient and the gas rapidly cools to @xmath59 ( _ e.g. _ theuns 1998 , dav 1999 ) .",
    "we will thus take the following relation between temperature and density @xmath60 in the high - density regions where shock heating is important this is only a very crude approximation of the @xmath61 diagram of hydrodynamical simulation ( theuns 1998 , dav 1999 , croft 2002 ) .",
    "however , it is mainly the moderate density regions which are responsible for the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "( [ statesim ] ) should thus be sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the gas temperature @xmath62 at fixed overdensity is expected to evolve with redshift .",
    "schaye 2000 and theuns 2002 claim to have detected a peak at @xmath46 with decreasing temperature towards lower and higher redshifts .",
    "note that we have ignored a possible redshift dependence and have assumed @xmath63 independent of redshift .",
    "we have adopted a very simple model for the effect of wind bubbles .",
    "we simply assume that shocks produce long - lived _ fully ionised _",
    "spherical bubbles around galaxies ( see appendix a for a discussion of the physical properties of expanding wind bubbles ) .",
    "we assume that the neutral hydrogen  density is zero in a spherical region of radius @xmath64 centered on the dm haloes which we have chosen to identify as lbgs .",
    "note that this simple model has also been discussed in croft ( 2002 ) , kollmeier et al .",
    "2003 ( 2003a,2003b ) and weinberg et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in the simulation ,",
    "most of the haloes lie along filaments , or at the intersection of filaments , and the gas distribution around the haloes is often anisotropic on the scale of galactic winds ( e.g. croft 2002 , springel & hernquist 2003 ) .",
    "theuns ( 2002 ) have also shown that winds propagate more easily into the low density igm than in the filaments , giving rise to highly ionised regions which are generally not spherical .",
    "it should thus be kept in mind that our assumption of a spherical wind bubble will only be a reasonable approximation for strong isotropic winds .",
    "furthermore the bubbles do not necessarily live longer than a hubble time .",
    "a discussion of the physical properties of shocks in the igm can be found in appendix  [ cooltimescale ] .",
    "once we have smoothed the dark matter density @xmath38 , the flux distribution depends only on @xmath65 and @xmath0 and the size distribution of wind bubbles .",
    "we have assumed @xmath66 and constrain @xmath65 from a random sample of 500 lines of sight of comoving length @xmath44 by demanding that the mean flux @xmath67 is equal to the observed value @xmath68 ( rauch 1997 , mcdonald 2000 ) .",
    "the effect of varying the assumed size distribution of wind bubbles are discussed in the following sections .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath69 , somewhat smaller than in the assp data , where it is @xmath70 .",
    "note that the mean inter - particle distance in the simulation is @xmath71 .",
    "this is sufficient to resolve @xmath72 on a scale @xmath73 as in the observations , but is somewhat too low to resolve all the features of the ly@xmath0 absorption lines ( e.g. theuns 1998 , bryan 1999 ) .",
    "we also add noise with signal - to - noise s / n=50 per pixel of width @xmath74 .",
    "we will first investigate some basic flux statistics of our synthetic spectra to check if they are a reasonable representation of observed spectra and to study the effect of the wind bubbles .",
    "we begin with the flux probability distribution function ( pdf ) defined as the fraction of the volume of the igm which has a flux value within a certain range .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] compares the flux pdf at @xmath46 for wind bubbles with different radii @xmath64 .",
    "the filled circles show the observed pdf from mcdonald 2000 , while the solid , long - dashed , short - dashed and dotted curves correspond to @xmath75 ( i.e. , no wind ) , 0.5 , 1 and @xmath76 , respectively . following mcdonald ( 2000 ) we use 21 bins of width @xmath77 to compute the flux pdf .",
    "the pdf of spectra without wind bubbles ( solid curve ) agrees very well with the pdf of the observed spectra ( filled circles ) . including wind bubbles with @xmath78",
    "has no significant effect on the flux pdf , and even when @xmath64 is as large as @xmath76 there is only a slight discrepancy with the flux pdf of the observed spectra in saturated regions with @xmath79 .",
    "the small effect of the wind bubbles is due to their small volume filling factor @xmath80 , which is about 5% for the model with @xmath81 .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of theuns ( 2002 ) and weinberg et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we can place an upper bound on the volume filling factor , @xmath82 , of bubbles by demanding a good match between the simulated and observed pdfs .",
    "we have computed the flux pdf for several bubbles radii for which @xmath80 is in the range 0.01 - 0.5 . to account for the uncertainty in the mass of lbgs",
    ", we performed three computations for each @xmath80  : we selected dm haloes with mass @xmath83 larger than @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and adjusted @xmath64 which gives the desired @xmath82 .",
    "we find that independent of halo mass , a filling factor @xmath87 yields a poor match to the observations , especially in the range @xmath88 , as shown in the small plot inside the right panel of fig .",

    "the flux power spectrum was calculated with a fft routine from 500 synthetic spectra .",
    "note that our simulation box and therefore the spectra are not periodic which may lead to small artifacts at small scales . the flux power of our synthetic spectra and that of the observed spectra obtained by mcdonald ( 2000 ) also agree very well .",

    "[ fig2 ] show the flux pdf and the power spectrum in real space for @xmath75 obtained by setting the peculiar velocities and thermal motions to zero .",
    "the real space flux pdf and power spectrum significantly deviate from the observations .",

    "we could therefore estimate @xmath104 from the transverse correlation @xmath105 .",
    "however , real observation will sample the flux field @xmath106 more sparsely .",
    "assp have therefore estimated @xmath104 from the averaged 2d halo flux correlation function @xmath100 using eq .",
    "( [ corr.con ] ) in order to maximize the signal .",
    "we proceed as assp do and calculate @xmath107 as follows .",
    "we first pick a los direction .",
    "we then produce an ensemble of spectra along this direction with random offsets perpendicular to the chosen direction . for each pair of halo / spectrum",
    "we determine the flux @xmath108 , the distance @xmath8 at the point of closest approach , and the distance @xmath102 between the halo and a given pixel of the spectrum .",
    "this process is repeated for an ensemble of randomly chosen los directions .",
    "we then obtain @xmath109 by annular averaging @xmath108 , and binning in bins of comoving size @xmath110 .",
    "we further average over all haloes and los . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the full 2d distribution of the average flux @xmath111 around haloes assumed to host lbgs .",
    "the haloes were assumed to have no galactic wind bubbles .",
    "the bin size is @xmath112 , twice smaller than that we use for @xmath72 .",
    "the shaded area shows bins for which @xmath72 is within 0.05 from the mean flux @xmath113 .",
    "contours are for flux levels increasing from 0.2 to 0.6 with decreasing line width .",
    "the contours are compressed along the line of sight as a result of the peculiar and thermal motions of the gas . at small separation",
    "the transmissivity is much smaller than the mean due to the increased density near haloes .",
    "redshift distortions cause @xmath104 ( as computed in assp ) to be different from the transverse correlation @xmath114 .",
    "this can be seen in the middle panel of fig .",
    "the effect is important for @xmath115 .",
    "note that previous work compared also the assp measurements with @xmath104 obtained from numerical simulations ( e.g. croft 2002 , kollmeier 2003 , bruscoli 2003 ) .",
    "the sample of assp contains 431 galaxies in 7 fields containing a qso ( one field contains two qsos ) . at large scales (",
    "@xmath116 a few mpc ) the number of galaxy los pairs is reasonably large .",
    "however at small scales the number of available galaxies becomes very small .",
    "there are _",
    "e.g. _ only 3 galaxies within a transverse separation of @xmath117 to the line - of - sight to a qso .",
    "obviously poisson errors will then be large and estimating these errors is thus important . in the following we use the term _ cosmic variance _ to describe the error resulting from the finite number of galaxies and qso spectra . at small scales",
    "cosmic variance is the dominant source of error .",
    "other sources of errors also affect the calculation of @xmath118 , mainly the uncertainty of the mean flux @xmath113 , and the redshift position of the galaxies .",
    "these errors will be discussed in section   [ e : role ] .",
    "about one los from a bright qso is expected to pass through a region of angular dimensions comparable to that of our simulation box at @xmath46 . however , the correlation length of the flux is around a few @xmath43 .",
    "there will thus be about a hundred los through the simulation box which represent independent flux measurements .",
    "we therefore estimate the cosmic variance error as follows from the simulation . for each separation bin of width @xmath119 we perform monte - carlo realizations of @xmath104 , where @xmath104 is averaged over the halo / spectrum pairs lying in the given bin .",
    "the cosmic variance error is then the @xmath120 scatter around @xmath109 .",
    "the error of @xmath104 depends on the total number of galaxies / haloes with separation @xmath99 .",
    "a sample of about 40 los through our simulation box gives a cumulative halo function @xmath121 close to the cumulative galaxy function @xmath122 of the assp sample for separation @xmath123 .",
    "note also that the number of haloes with @xmath124 in the simulation is only about 110 .",
    "this means that we severely oversample the halo catalog when we estimate the cosmic variance on large scales .",
    "however , at the small scales in which we are mainly interested this should have little effect .",
    "we first explore the shape of @xmath72 assuming that all wind bubbles have the same radius , @xmath64 , independent of the halo mass that they surround . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot @xmath72 for haloes with mass @xmath125 . we show curves for @xmath126 , 1 and @xmath76 as indicated in the figure .",
    "the corresponding filling factors are @xmath127% , @xmath128% and @xmath129% respectively , small enough to ensure that the flux pdf , the power spectrum and the line distribution of the ly@xmath0  forest are not affected .",
    "the dashed - dotted curve corresponds to @xmath72 in the absence of outflows .",
    "the filled symbols show the observed correlation as given in assp .",
    "the shaded area shows the cosmic variance error , and is calculated ( cf .",
    "section   [ errors ] ) from the cumulative halo distribution @xmath121 also shown as a histogram in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( right axis ) .",
    "the cosmic variance error is only shown for @xmath78 .",
    "the trend of decreasing mean flux with decreasing distance to the next galaxy in the observations is well reproduced by the numerical simulations . at small separation",
    "this trend is inverted if the wind bubbles are included .",
    "as kollmeier et al . ( 2003a , 2003b ) we find that the strong increase of the mean flux level at @xmath130 , is only reproduced for bubbles with size as large as @xmath131 .",
    "we thus confirm the difficulty of other authors to reproduce the mean flux at small separation unless rather large bubbles are included .",
    "bubbles of this size are , however , difficult to explain even with very efficient galactic superwinds ( croft et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "there are thus two possibilities : the simple model of spherical wind bubbles of constant size around massive haloes does not describe the effect of winds of observed galaxies properly or the observed strong increase of the flux level in the assp is a statistical fluke .",
    "we will explore both possibilities in the following sections in more detail .",
    "kollmeier ( 2002 ) have pointed out that the peculiar velocities of matter infalling onto the galaxy / dm halo expected from hierarchical structure formation should have a strong influence on @xmath104 at small separations . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we investigate the effect of coherent small - scale peculiar velocities and thermal velocities . in the left and middle panel",
    "we show @xmath104 with and without peculiar and thermal velocities for wind bubbles of size @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively . without peculiar velocity",
    "the increase of the mean flux at small separation is much more pronounced .",
    "this is easy to understand . in redshift space",
    "the velocity shear of the infalling surrounding material fills in the cavity which is caused by the fully ionised wind bubble in real space . for the smaller bubble size",
    "such an effect is also visible for the thermal velocities alone .",
    "neutral hydrogen  lying at the boundary of the ionised bubbles leads to significant ly@xmath0  absorption at the redshift halo position when the ratio @xmath134 is large enough .",
    "the peculiar velocity will , however , always dominate over the effect of thermal velocities .",
    "this can be seen in the right panel where we have scaled the temperature of the gas up and down .",
    "this has very little effect on @xmath104 calculated with peculiar velocities even for the smaller bubble size .",
    "we have also computed @xmath104 for various values of the density threshold in eq .",
    "( [ statesim ] ) .",
    "we found only small differences for @xmath135 .",
    "such overdensities occur typically within @xmath136 ( comoving ) from the halo ( kollmeier 2003 ) which is smaller than the bubble radii considered here .",
    "note that the good agreement of the flux pdf of the synthetic spectra with the mcdonald ( 2000 ) data found in section 3 disappeared if peculiar velocities were set to zero .",
    "this indicates that our simulations have similar peculiar velocities as the gas responsible for the observed absorption  at least in a volume - averaged sense .    in the left panel of fig .",

    "the velocity shear in the less massive halo ( left panel ) is quite modest . on the contrary",
    ", the velocity field near the massive halo ( right panel ) has a large infall on a physical scale of a few hundred @xmath9 , which moves some of the moderate density peaks close to the redshift space position of the halo .",

    "there is a number of other uncertainties which have to be taken into account when comparing the observed @xmath154 with that calculated from the numerical simulation .",
    "most important are the uncertain redshifts of the lbgs .",
    "there are large systematic shifts of several hundred @xmath9 between the redshift of nebular emission lines , ly@xmath0  emission and interstellar absorption lines which make the assignment of a redshift somewhat ambiguous .",

    "our errors are generally larger than that of assp , at @xmath10 by about 30 percent . at larger scales",
    "the difference is smaller but note that there our sample is about 20% larger than that of assp .",
    "note also that the errors decrease faster than those of the transverse correlation @xmath165 .",
    "the mean flux level of qso spectra varies significantly from spectrum to spectrum ( 10 - 20 percent ) .",
    "we thus also investigated how @xmath72 depends on the value of the mean flux @xmath113 . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show the effect of varying @xmath113 .",
    "the long - dashed curve is our fiducial `` massive '' haloes model , which has @xmath78 and @xmath157 .",
    "the upper ( solid ) and lower ( short - dashed ) curves show @xmath166 and 0.62 respectively . a larger ( lower ) mean transmitted flux @xmath113 raises ( lowers )",

    "@xmath68 matches the large scale assp measurements best .",
    "so far we have considered bubbles with sizes that are independent of mass .",
    "unfortunately , it is far from obvious what scaling with mass is appropriate .",
    "obviously , on average more stars and a larger total energy input from stellar feedback are expected in the more massive haloes .",
    "however , simple binding energy arguments show that winds should escape more easily from low mass haloes ( larson 1974 , dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "this may be properly taken into account by a constant bubble radius but this is very uncertain .",
    "we therefore investigate the effect of different power - law scalings of the bubble size with mass .",

    "it appears thus difficult to reproduce the observations of assp at small and large scales simultaneously by changing the mass - radius relation of the bubbles .    in the right panels of fig.[fig8 ] we investigate the effect of changing the minimum mass above which dm haloes are assumed to be surrounded by wind bubbles . changing",
    "@xmath175 will change the total space density of the halo as given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "there is less absorption if @xmath175 decreases , mainly as a result of the increasing bubble filling factor . with a bubble radius @xmath94 ,",
    "the filling factor is @xmath176 and @xmath177 for @xmath178 and @xmath179 , respectively .",
    "so far we have assumed that lbgs are hosted by the most massive haloes available and have introduced a minimum mass to match their space density with that observed for lbgs .",
    "this assumes that lbgs are long - lived and have the same brightness over a fair fraction of the hubble time .",
    "this picture may be in conflict with the lack of the evolution of the space density of bright lbgs towards very high redshift which is more easily explained if lbgs are starbursts with a duty cycle of high star formation rate of less than 10% .",
    "this would mean that there is an about a factor ten or more larger number of dm haloes needed to host these lbgs than in the massive halo picture and the dm haloes hosting lbgs are less massive on average .",
    "as should be apparent from the previous section , for a given bubble size surrounding a typical lbg halo , this should reduce the effect of the velocity shear .",
    "it is then easier to reproduce the high mean flux levels at small separation .",
    "we investigate this alternative `` starburst '' picture here in more detail .",
    "kolatt ( 1999 ) developed a simple , _ ad hoc _ procedure to assign lbgs to colliding haloes identified in their n - body simulation and were able to reproduce both the number density and clustering properties of lbgs .",
    "here , we will do something simpler and randomly select haloes with mass @xmath143 such that their number density matches the observed lbgs number density , @xmath180 .",
    "this corresponds to a duty cycle of ten percent .",
    "note that only 10% of the haloes with a mass above @xmath181 are haloes as massive as our `` massive - halo '' picture i.e. have masses @xmath179 ( cf . table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "most of the lbg - size haloes have @xmath182 in the `` starburst '' scenario .",
    "we have produced 120 different monte - carlo realizations of such catalogs of starbursting haloes . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we compare @xmath104 for the `` massive - halo '' model ( solid curve ) and the `` starburst '' picture ( dashed curve )",
    ". for both we assume a bubble radius @xmath94 and a redshift error of the halo position of @xmath157 . at @xmath183 @xmath104 is larger in the `` starburst '' model by about 20% .",
    "we also plot the 1@xmath8 error for the starburst model and the assp measurements .",
    "our starburst model with @xmath94 and a volume filling factor of 2% appears to be fully consistent with the assp measurement .",
    "even at @xmath184 , where our estimate of the cosmic variance error is 30% larger than that of assp , @xmath104 in the starburst model is only slightly more than @xmath120 below the assp measurement despite a difference in the mean flux of @xmath185 .",
    "note that for the quoted volume filling factor we did only take into account the bubbles around the haloes that host lbgs at a given time .",
    "if the bubbles last longer than the lbg phase the volume filling factor would be higher by the same factor .      as discussed above our procedure",
    "to identify the host haloes of lbgs in the starburst model is rather crude . unlike kolatt",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) and wechsler et al . ( 2001 ) we do not identify `` colliding '' haloes but choose a fraction of less massive haloes at random .",
    "it is thus not obvious that the host haloes chosen in this way will reproduce the clustering properties of lbgs . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we compare the two - point correlation function of our `` starburst '' and `` massive - halo '' models .",
    "the correlation function in the starburst model was computed from 120 different monte - carlo realizations of catalogs of starbursting haloes .",
    "the correlation lengths for the `` starburst '' and `` massive - halo '' models are @xmath186 , and @xmath187 , respectively .",
    "the observed correlation length is @xmath188 ( adelberger 1998 , adelberger 2000 , arnouts 1999 , giavalisco & dickinson 2001 ) .",
    "the massive halo picture is thus in somewhat better agreement .",
    "however , the difference is small and as discussed above , kolatt ( 1999 ) and wechsler ( 2001 ) find that they can reproduce the observed clustering properties if they select `` colliding haloes '' as host galaxies of starbursting lbgs .",
    "we thus do not investigate this issue any further here .      to understand better why the cosmic variance error becomes so large at small separation we plot the probability distribution @xmath189 in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the distribution is very broad .",
    "about 40% of the haloes have @xmath144 larger than 0.8 .",
    "the probability of finding three ( uncorrelated ) haloes with @xmath190 at separation @xmath191 is thus still @xmath1925 - 10% .",
    "the symbols at the bottom of figure 5 show the increase of @xmath144 if the thermal motions and the velocity shear are artificially reduced by a factor of two .",
    "the broad probability distribution also explains why the suggestion of croft et .",
    "( 2002 ) that lbgs are preferentially located in haloes with a low - density environment has such a strong effect on the mean transmission .",
    "we used mock spectra obtained from numerical simulations to investigate the effect of fully ionised bubbles around the galactic haloes hosting lbgs on the  distribution in the igm as probed by the ly@xmath0  forest in qso spectra . by matching the probability distribution and the power spectrum of the flux of mock spectra obtained from a n - body simulation of a @xmath1cdm model with those of observed spectra we derive an upper limit of @xmath2 on the volume filling factor of bubbles .",
    "we further considered the mean transmitted flux at a given distance from galactic haloes . to model the observational data we computed the mean transmitted flux @xmath72 from an annular average of the two - dimensional conditional flux @xmath193 , in the same way as done by adelberger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . as previous investigations",
    "we find that the observed decrease of the transmission at separation @xmath194 to a halo is well reproduced by the simulated spectra .",
    "it is due to the increased matter density around haloes .",
    "we further find that an increase of the transmissivity at the smallest separations @xmath10 requires bubble radii of @xmath195 .",
    "this is two to three times larger than the separation at which the increase of the transmissivity is observed . as discussed by kollmeier 2003",
    "this is because in redshift space the velocity shear of the material infalling onto the halo fills in the cavity which is caused by the fully ionised wind bubble in real space . for a model where",
    "the haloes are surrounded with bubbles of size @xmath195 there is no effect on either the flux pdf or the flux power spectrum .",
    "the flux pdf and the flux power spectrum of our simulated spectra are fully consistent with those of observed spectra .",
    "this is because the volume filling factor of the ionised bubbles is still small .",
    "we have investigated a variety of scalings of bubble size with halo mass .",
    "we also compared a model where lbgs are long - lived and are hosted by the most massive haloes with a model where lbgs are short - lived starburts and are hosted by more numerous less massive haloes . unlike kolatt ( 1999 ) and wechsler ( 2001 )",
    ", we do not identify starbursts as `` colliding haloes '' but choose a fraction of less massive haloes at random . matching the observed transmission at scales",
    "@xmath194 is not difficult and there is certainly more than one way to do so . introducing redshift errors at the expected level improves the agreement with the observations .",
    "the increase in transmission at small separation in our model spectra spectra is , however , generally more gradual than that of the observed measurements . as other authors we found it challenging to match the observations at the smallest separation .",
    "numerical simulations including galactic winds and simple analytical estimates as the one in appendix  [ cooltimescale ] agree that the required bubble sizes are difficult to achieve ( croft et al .",
    "2002 , bruscoli et al .",
    "we have thus particularly looked into models which are consistent with the observed measurements and are most `` economical '' in terms of bubble size .",
    "the velocity shear around haloes increases with increasing mass .",
    "haloes of lower mass require thus smaller bubble radii to explain the observed increase of the transmission at @xmath191 .",
    "this may favour a model where lbgs are starburst galaxies hosted by more numerous less massive haloes .",
    "we have taken special care in estimating the errors on the flux near galaxies in a similar way as done in the observations .",
    "for small separations we found that the expected error due to cosmic variance is about 30% larger than estimated by assp .",
    "our starburst model is consistent with all measurements for a bubble radius of @xmath196 and a volume filling factor of 2%",
    ". a bubble size of @xmath196 appears , however , still difficult to achieve for galactic winds .",
    "if for some reason the velocity shear around haloes is smaller than suggested by our ( dm only ) simulation this would further reduce the required bubble size and filling factor .",
    "the correlation length for our `` starburst '' model is @xmath186 , slightly lower than the observations . identifying the lbgs with satellites infalling on high mass haloes , as in kolatt ( 1999 ) ,",
    "would further improve the agreement with the observed clustering properties of lbgs . however , this would be at the expense of matching the observed small - scale flux @xmath72 , since the velocity shear increases with halo mass",
    ". therefore we advocate the model in which starbursts occur in small mass haloes . in a @xmath1cdm cosmology of normalisation @xmath197",
    ", this model yields a reasonable match to the observed clustering of lbgs and transmitted flux @xmath72 .",
    "the mean transmitted flux of our simulated spectra at the smallest separation is 30 percent smaller than that of the assp sample .",
    "we would thus expect the observed mean transmission to decrease substantially for larger samples if the model is correct . a sample with 12 lbgs at separation @xmath10 should reduce the error to @xmath198 .",
    "this should help to discriminate against alternative models like the suggestion of croft ( 2002 ) that lbgs are located preferentially in low - density environments .",

    "let @xmath234 be the position of the shock front at time @xmath235 after the burst .",
    "the jump conditions relate the density @xmath236 of the unperturbed igm to the density @xmath237 , the pressure @xmath238 and the temperature @xmath239 at the shock front . for a strong adiabatic shock",

    "the position of the shock front corresponds then to a fixed value of @xmath244 .",
    "hence , @xmath242 is given by ( sedov 1959 ) @xmath245 where @xmath211 is the energy released in the wind . inserting the value of @xmath200 in the expressions of @xmath242 and @xmath239",
    ", we find @xmath246 since the temperature behind the shock front @xmath247 is a decreasing function of @xmath248 , @xmath249 reaches its minimum at the shock front .",
    "this solution holds only in the regime where the expansion is negligible , i.e. @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the hubble time scale .",
    "self - similar solutions for @xmath252 including this latter complication exist ( ostriker & mckee 1988 ) , but since energy and momentum conservation break down for @xmath253 , it is difficult to express the asymptotic solution as a function of the initial @xmath254 .",
    "the evolution of such an expanding shock depends critically on cooling which will lower the temperature of the shell and its interior , thereby increasing the amount of  hydrogen available for ly@xmath0  resonant scattering .",
    "the expanding shell cools due to radiative losses .",
    "the shock will undergo a phase of shell formation which will occur when the energy dissipated in a volume @xmath255 will be of the order of @xmath200 .",
    "cooling is expected to be more efficient at the shock front since , at @xmath256 , the density ( temperature ) is larger ( lower ) than at @xmath257 .",
    "thus , shell formation first occurs at the shock front . as long as we are in the regime of low density , @xmath258 , and high temperature , @xmath259 , radiative cooling",
    "is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "however , for temperature @xmath260 , atomic line cooling might contribute significantly to the cooling rate @xmath1 ( in @xmath261 ) if the wind is enriched with heavy elements . for a wind of metallicity @xmath262 ( e.g. adelberger 2003 ) , the cooling rate is @xmath263 in the range @xmath264 ( e.g. sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "we assume that cooling at the shock front , where the temperature is @xmath260 , is dominated by atomic line transitions .",
    "this is true when the temperature of the shell is @xmath265 , i.e. for times @xmath266 .",
    "the cooling time scale at the shock front is then @xmath267 , @xmath268 where the cooling rate @xmath269 is in unit of @xmath270 and is assumed to be constant in the temperature range @xmath271 .",
    "once the shell starts forming , the temperature @xmath239 of the shell cools to @xmath272 on a very short time scale .",
    "however , in the range @xmath273 , the cooling rate @xmath1 drops sharply from @xmath274 down to @xmath275 ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) and the shell can not cool below temperature @xmath59 .",
    "we define now a radius @xmath276 such that the cooling time scale @xmath277 as a function of radius @xmath248 satisfies @xmath278 for @xmath279 . according to this definition",
    ", the gas between @xmath276 and @xmath234 has cooled onto the shell by the time @xmath235 . to express @xmath277 as a function of @xmath248 and @xmath235",
    ", it should be noted that the number density @xmath280 behind the shock front ( in @xmath281 ) scales as @xmath282 with @xmath283 typically .",
    "this relation is however valid in the asymptotic regime only .",
    "therefore , assuming that the plasma has reached pressure equilibrium , the temperature @xmath284 behind the shock front is @xmath285 , and the radiative cooling time scale @xmath277 is @xmath286 on fig .",
    "[ figapp2 ] the solid curves are @xmath276 for various cooling time rate @xmath269 , and the dashed curve is @xmath287 .",
    "the shell starts forming at the shock front when @xmath276 intersects @xmath234 . for larger time",
    ", cooling occurs for @xmath288 ( shaded area ) .",
    "since most of the gas swept up by the wind lies at @xmath289 , a large fraction of gas cools down to @xmath59 shortly after the shell formation . for @xmath290 ,",
    "about 30% of the mass enclosed in the bubble has cooled into the shell over a hubble time @xmath251 , where @xmath291 at @xmath46 . for a high metallicity wind @xmath292 ,",
    "cooling becomes severe for @xmath293 a few @xmath294 , a time scale shorter than the hubble time scale @xmath251 at @xmath46 . on the contrary , for a low metallicity wind , @xmath295 , the cooling rate is @xmath296 and cooling will not become significant for @xmath297 .",
    "hence , most of the bubbles will not survive over a hubble time scale unless the cooling time rate @xmath269 , or the wind metallicity @xmath298 , is very low .",
    "for radii @xmath299 , the temperature is higher than @xmath300 , and thermal bremsstrahlung and inverse compton cooling prevail over line cooling , but the corresponding cooling times are still smaller than the hubble time at @xmath46 .      to compute the thickness @xmath301 of the shell , we assume that the pressure is constant through the inner plasma and the shell .",
    "since the temperature of the shell , @xmath302 , is much lower than the overall temperature @xmath303 of the highly ionised plasma , we expect @xmath304 , i.e. the shell is thin .",
    "taking into account this assumption , we find @xmath305\\ ; , \\label{eq106}\\ ] ] a result consistent with a thin shell approximation .",
    "assuming @xmath306 and neglecting the expansion of the universe gives @xmath307 .",
    "@xmath110 should thus not exceed a few @xmath308 , a scale which can not be resolved in our simulation .",
    "the optical depth for resonant ly@xmath0 scattering is given by @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the  neutral fraction at temperature @xmath59 .",
    "ly@xmath0  absorption is expected for reasonable values of the density contrast @xmath311 , the typical comoving radius of the bubble @xmath312 , and the baryon fraction @xmath313 . however , since we can not resolve the thin shell in our simulation , we have nevertheless ignored its ly@xmath0  absorption .",
    "to assess the sensitivity of the transmitted flux to numerical resolution , we perform a calculation with the highest resolution simulation of the series , which has a mass resolution @xmath314 .",
    "the halo catalog and the flux in the simulation are computed as in section   [ nbody ] with a pixel resolution @xmath51 ( comoving ) .",

    "[ figapp3 ] we show the transmitted flux as computed in the `` starburst '' scenario for a bubble radius @xmath94 . the mass resolution is @xmath316 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath317 ( solid curve ) . in the latter",
    "the strong absorption lines are better resolved , thereby slightly reducing the normalization of the optical depth @xmath318 .",
