    "recent developments in nanophysics have made possible the use of the charge and spin dynamics of electrons to develop new technologies like spintronics and quantronics .",
    "this has moreover led to the possibility of using the electron spin , or other more complex entities like the phase in josephon junctions to fabricate qubits for quantum computing . however , the utility of these nanosystems as qubits is strongly limited by their coupling to the omnipresent dissipative environment .",
    "the environment destroys the coherence of the qubit over a certain time scale and a lot of recent theoretical and experimental activity has focused on ways and means to increase this time scale .",
    "this clearly emphasizes the importance of understanding the effects engendered by the coupling of a two level system to a dissipative bath .",
    "the fact that the environment plays a crucial role in the physics of small quantum systems has been well known since the pioneering work of ref . , where it was shown that the coupling of a two level system to an ohmic boson bath could effectively suppress the tunneling of the two level system . in the context of decoherence ,",
    "the most commonly studied problem is the spin - boson model @xcite which describes the effect of a dissipative bosonic bath on a central spin , where the spin can be an effective description of a system whose discrete lowest energy levels dominate the physics at low enough temperatures and the bosons are often the phonons present in the system .",
    "a physical manifestation of the spin boson problem is a nanomagnet ( described by a giant spin ) coupled to phonons @xcite .",
    "however , for many practical realisations of a central spin or a qubit ( spin @xmath0 ) , a spin bath comprising other spins might be the principal source of decoherence .",
    "this is indeed the case in semiconducting quantum dots , where the nuclei with non zero spins constitute the spin bath and interact with the central electronic spin in the dot via the hyperfine interaction @xcite .",
    "another manifestation of a spinbath occurs in si : p @xcite .",
    "the abundance of spin baths in real systems , necessitates an understanding of their effect on decoherence . unlike the case of bosonic baths often modeled as a collection of harmonic oscillators",
    ", spin baths can exhibit a wide range of phenomena depending on the interactions between the spins , residual anisotropies etc .",
    "clearly one expects any resulting decoherence of the central spin to depend rather crucially on the underlying nature of the spin bath and its coupling to the central spin .",
    "earlier studies which considered independent spins in the bath seemed to indicate that spin baths were not qualitatively different from bosonic baths @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , recent studies of decoherence induced by spin baths described by mean field hamiltonians have demonstrated that interactions between the bath spins can be used as a lever to augment the time scales over which the system decoheres @xcite .",
    "these results were however obtained either numerically for a bath with a small number of spins or for the special case where the bath hamiltonian commutes with the bath - central spin coupling hamiltonian leading to an effective classical decoherence .",
    "a more robust treatment of intrabath interactions was presented in ref . where the authors studied numerically the zero temperature _ quantum _ decoherence of two coupled spins engendered by a bath described by the random transverse ising model .",
    "the authors used this model to argue that the central spin decoheres differently , depending on whether the spinbath has a regular or chaotic spectra . despite their various drawbacks",
    ", these works collectively highlight the importance of interactions and disorder in the bath .",
    "moreover , disordered spin baths warrant further attention because both interactions ( often dipolar ) and disorder are present in real spin bath systems like quantum dots in semiconducting heterojunctions and in si : p .    in this paper",
    ", we re - examine the decoherence induced by disordered interacting spinbaths at finite temperatures .",
    "more precisely , we study the effect of an ising bath with random spin - spin interactions on the coherence of a single spin @xmath0 .",
    "the random interactions are characterized by their variance @xmath1 where @xmath2 is analogous to the cut off frequency for a bosonic bath as well as a mean value @xmath3 which has no bosonic counterpart .",
    "our choice of an ising bath is primarily to facilitate an analytical study of the problem at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit . to ensure a quantum decoherence of the central spin in our model , the central spin",
    "is coupled to the transverse spin components of the bath . to better comprehend the effect of the bath",
    ", we consider a model in which the time evolution of the central spin is exclusively governed by its coupling to the bath .",
    "for such a model , the problem is exactly soluble for a bath comprising independent spins / bosons .",
    "however , when intra - bath interactions are present , no exact solution can be obtained and one has to take recourse to approximate methods . in this paper",
    ", we only study the limit of a weak coupling of the central spin to the bath , where robust analytical methods are available to study the problem in an unbiased manner .",
    "we use the resolvent operator method , which takes us beyond the oft used markovian master equation approaches to study the decoherence of the central spin induced by a perturbative coupling to the ising spin bath .",
    "an interesting aspect of our work is that in the absence of any dynamics intrinsic to the central spin , for weak coupling to the bath , the decoherence is primarily dictated by the local - field distribution or equivalently , the dynamic structure factor of the bath spins .",
    "for a bath described by an ising spin chain , we obtain the markovian decoherence time scale and the non markovian corrections as a function of the temperature and the parameters of the bath .",
    "we also discuss the case of ising spins on various lattices in the high temperature regime and the case of the infinite - ranged sherrington - kirkpatrick spin glass model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we present the model and derive a general expression for the decoherence of the central spin in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] followed by a discussion of the weak coupling regime in sec .",
    "[ sec : wcr ] .",
    "we then present our results for different disordered ising spin baths in sec .",
    "[ sec : disb ] .",
    "we present the model used to study the decoherence of the central spin @xmath4 , weakly coupled to a bond - disordered bath of @xmath5 ising spins @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath7 .",
    "the total hamiltonian describing the combined system of the central spin and the spin bath is given by @xmath8 where , @xmath9 is the @xmath10-component pauli operator of the central spin and @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the pauli operators of the bath spins and @xmath13 are the interaction strengths between the bath spins .",
    "depending on the details of the model studied , @xmath14 could represent interactions between nearest neighbour spins or interactions of infinite range .",
    "in contrast to the models studied in ref .  , where the bath hamiltonian @xmath15 and the bath operator @xmath16 that couples to the central spin commute , here our choice of @xmath16 is such that @xmath17 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "the central spin and spin bath coupling is characterized by the parameters @xmath18 . since",
    ", we are interested in the influence of disorder as well as the tendency of the system to order , we consider random interaction energies @xmath13 which are quenched random variables drawn from a distribution @xmath19 with mean @xmath3 and variance @xmath1 .",
    "though the central spin does not have any intrinsic dynamics , its coupling to the bath generates a non trivial dynamical behaviour .",
    "we note that @xmath15 is the usual ising spin glass hamiltonian which has been well studied in the past@xcite . depending on the distribution of the spin - spin interactions and the dimensionality , this model can exhibit ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic or even spin glass order in some temperature range .",
    "since these phenomena have ramificiations for the collective behaviour of the bath , it is reasonable to expect the resulting decoherence to depend crucially on the underlying order in the bath .",
    "it is important to note that the formalism developed in this section and sec .",
    "[ sec : wcr ] is _ a priori _ applicable to any bath hamiltonian @xmath15 ( bosonic baths , heisenberg spin baths , baths with both spins and bosons etc ) . for a hamiltonian of the form , since @xmath9 is a constant of motion , it is convenient to directly study the time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the central spin @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the initial density matrix of the composite system consisting of the central spin and the bath and @xmath22 denotes the partial trace over the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "we use the units @xmath23 in this paper . denoting the eigenstates of @xmath9 by @xmath24 and @xmath25",

    "often these coherences vanish at long times resulting in a decoherence of the central spin i.e. , the asymptotic state of the central spin is a mixture of the states @xmath24 and @xmath25 irrespective of the nature of the initial state @xmath21 .    to simplify the calculation",
    ", we assume that at time @xmath32 , the central spin and the bath are disentangled resulting in a factorizable initial density matrix : @xmath33 .",
    "we further suppose that initially the central spin is in a pure state @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and that the bath is at thermal equilibrium with temperature @xmath36 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the bath partition function . with these initial conditions",
    "we obtain the time evolved reduced density matrix    @xmath39    where the factor @xmath40 is a measure of the decoherence induced by the bath at time @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 denotes the usual trace as @xmath15 and @xmath16 are operators in the bath hilbert space . under a rotation of @xmath43 around the @xmath44-axis , while @xmath15 and @xmath45 remain unchanged , @xmath46 .",
    "consequently the coherence @xmath47 is a real number . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "though the coherence @xmath48 is easy to evaluate for baths consisting of non - interacting spins / bosons ( see appendix  [ isb ] ) , it is rather difficult to estimate for an interacting spin bath for arbitrary values of the coupling to the central spin .",
    "we remark that @xmath47 is related to loschmidt echoes of the bath which characterize its sensitivity to perturbations in its equations of motion @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present a perturbative formalism to calculate @xmath47 valid for weak coupling to the bath i.e. , the energy scale of the operator @xmath16 is much smaller than all the energy scales of the bath .",
    "we use the resolvent operator method which goes beyond the born - markov approach and , though perturbative , is intrinsically capable of handling non - markovian time evolutions .",
    "we obtain a tractable expression for the decoherence in the weak coupling regime .      to determine the complete time evolution of the coherence @xmath48 in the weak coupling limit @xmath49 , we first express it in terms of a _ self energy _",
    "@xmath50@xcite . to obtain the self energy ,",
    "it is convenient to work with the laplace transform of @xmath47 @xmath51 where @xmath44 is a complex variable with @xmath52 .",

    "note that @xmath57 is not a liouville operator whereas @xmath56 is the liouville operator corresponding to the bath hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "we reiterate that the above derivation for and is independent of the specific hamiltonian @xmath15 and coupling operator @xmath16 considered in this paper .",
    "the self - energy @xmath50 can now be expanded perturbatively in the interaction operator @xmath16 .",
    "the second order result is given by the expression with @xmath58 replaced by the bath liouvillian @xmath56 .",
    "the first - order term @xmath65 vanishes for the ising spin bath hamiltonian @xmath15 and the interaction operator @xmath16 defined by .",
    "therefore , the first non - zero contribution to the self - energy is given by the second - order term @xmath66 which can be rewritten in terms of the time - dependent symmetrised correlation function of @xmath16 ( see appendix  [ sose ] ) : @xmath67 \\label{sosigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 refers to the thermal average over bath spin configurations .",
    "neglecting higher order contributions to @xmath50 in is equivalent to the born approximation @xcite .",
    "we will see in the following that this approximation can describe the decoherence at all timescales whereas a direct expansion of the coherence @xmath48 gives only the short - time evolution .",
    "we remark that in the case of heisenberg spins , an underlying magnetic order could result in a first order contribution to the self energy which would then lead to an oscillatory behaviour of @xmath47 .",
    "the advantage of the resolvent operator formalism is that we can use the analyticity properties of the self energy @xmath50 to obtain a tractable expression for the coherence @xmath48 .",
    "as shown in appendix  [ dse ] , since @xmath15 and @xmath16 are hermitian operators , the spectrum of the operator @xmath58 is real and hence the self - energy @xmath50 is analytic in the upper ( lower ) half plane .",
    "furthermore , since the spectrum of @xmath69 in the thermodynamic limit is expected to be a continuum for the models considered in this paper , the self - energy @xmath50 manifests a branch cut on the real axis .",

    "however , for the short and intermediate time evolution of @xmath48 , the full energy dependence of @xmath87 comes into play which can then lead to a _ non - exponential decay _",

    "is valid to all orders in @xmath16 for a bath of independent bosons .",
    "in this section , we use the formalism of the previous section to determine the decoherence induced by various disordered ising spin baths . though the spinbath models of real systems are expected to be more complicated than the ising hamiltonians considered here , we nonetheless study these systems in various dimensions to understand the effect of these simpler systems on the decoherence .",
