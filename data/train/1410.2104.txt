    "an example of the profiles of such modes is shown in the central and right panels of fig.2(b ) . a weakly nonlinear analysis of eq.(1 ) above threshold shows that both modes oscillate , because self - saturation prevails over cross - saturation of the gain .",
    "the technical details are given in appendix b. correspondingly , as @xmath16 is increased above @xmath63 the laser ceases to emit a continuous - wave power , and an oscillatory behavior is observed as a result of mode beating and mode non - orthogonality ; see fig.2(e ) .",
    "the transition from a stationary to an oscillatory laser emission is thus the clear signature of the @xmath0 symmetry breaking transition in the wick - rotated hamiltonian . to get an idea of physical parameters corresponding to the symmetry breaking transition ,",
    "let us consider as an example an optical cavity for a he - ne laser ( @xmath64 nm ) and let us assume a gaussian aperture of size @xmath65 m , a focal length @xmath66 cm , and a total cavity length @xmath67 cm .",
    "the characteristic spatial and temporal scales are @xmath68 m and @xmath69 ns , so that the transverse aperture of mirror 1 is @xmath70 m , the symmetry breaking transition , from a stationary to an oscillatory laser output power , occurs at the tilting angle @xmath71 mrad ; finally , the temporal period of power oscillations in fig.2(e ) is @xmath72 ns .",
    "as a second example , we consider the wick - rotated nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric dimeric model , which is obtained by assuming in eq.(5 ) a double well shape for the real part of @xmath33 . without wick rotation this model was studied in refs.@xcite , where coexistence of periodic and blow up ( unbounded ) solutions was predicted in the broken @xmath0 phase .",

    "the energy spectrum of @xmath74 versus @xmath16 shows a behavior similar to the squire operator ; in particular above a threshold @xmath63 the spectrum ceases to be real , and pairs of real energies coalesce and become complex conjugates .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the coalescence of the two lowest energy levels , corresponding to a symmetry breaking threshold @xmath75 . above laser threshold ,",
    "the onset of @xmath0 symmetry breaking corresponds to a transition from a stationary to an oscillatory laser emission arising from the coexistence of two non - orthogonal competing transverse modes ; see fig.3(c ) .",
    "an elegant physical explanation of the phase transition in terms of adler s theory of coupled oscillators @xcite can be gained within a reduced two - mode model of the double well potential @xcite .",
    "the field @xmath5 is approximated as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 are the ground - state wave functions localized in each of the two wells of the potential .",
    "the evolution equations of amplitudes @xmath78 are simply obtained from those of refs.@xcite after wick rotation , i.e. @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the hopping rate between adjacent wells , @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the decay rate in the absence of gain and coupling , @xmath83 accounts for mirror tilting , and @xmath84 is the gain saturation parameter .",
    "note that @xmath85 measures the energy separation of the two levels in fig.3(b ) at @xmath57 , @xmath82 is the mean values of such energies , and @xmath83 is proportional to the non - hermitian parameter @xmath16 ( mirror tilting ) .",
    "the optical power@xmath86 emitted by the laser is proportional to @xmath87 .",
    "the reduced model satisfactorily captures the spectral phase transition and the nonlinear dynamics above lasing threshold of the original hamiltonian ; see figs.3(b , c ) .",
    "interestingly , eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) describe a canonical model of coupled oscillators near hopf bifurcations , introduced for chemical and biological dissipative systems @xcite and studied in details by aronson _",
    "the wick - rotated @xmath0 symmetric dimer model basically describes two coupled laser oscillators @xcite : the two - humped variable reflectivity mirror induces laser emission in two transverse regions , where the gain is maximum .",
    "mode coupling is provided by evanescent field overlapping , whereas mirror tilting controls the detuning of frequency emission of the two lasing regions .",
    "the transition observed in fig.3(c ) above the symmetry breaking is ultimately associated with breaking of oscillator phase locking .",
    "in fact , after setting @xmath88 and considering the symmetric solutions @xmath89 , the coupled equations for the amplitude @xmath90 and relative phase @xmath91 of oscillators read ( see appendix c ) @xmath92 the phase equation is the adler s equation @xcite that describes a transition from a phase - locked state @xmath93 for @xmath94 ( i.e. @xmath95 , corresponding to a stationary amplitude @xmath90 , to a phase drift state , associated with an oscillatory amplitude @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "the signature of the spectral phase transition is thus universal phase locking - unlocking transition in adler s theory of coupled oscillators .",
    "@xmath0 symmetry has provided a fruitful concept in different areas of physics . in this work",

    "<S> @xmath0-symmetric models with a wick rotation of time ( @xmath1 ) show spectral phase transitions that are similar to those of dissipative systems driven out of equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> optics can provide an accessible test bed to explore spectral phase transitions of wick - rotated @xmath0-symmetric models . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown by considering the transverse dynamics of laser light in optical cavities with variable reflectivity and tilted mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> two specific examples are discussed : the optical analogue of the hydrodynamic squire model of vorticity , and the wick - rotated @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear dimer model . in the latter case the spectral phase transition </S>",
