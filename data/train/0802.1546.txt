    "in this paper , we will discuss selected aspects of the effects of quantum spacetime geometry fluctuations , using the riemann tensor correlation function as our basic tool .",
    "it is first useful to make a distinction between active fluctuations , which arise from the dynamical degrees of freedom of gravity itself , and passive fluctuations , which are driven by quantum stress tensor fluctuations of matter fields . in general , both types of fluctuations are present .",
    "we will be concerned with the case where the fluctuations around a classical background spacetime are small , so we can consider each type separately and add their effects .",
    "of course , a full treatment of active fluctuations would require a more complete theory of quantum gravity than currently exists , but we restrict our attention to quantized linear perturbations of the background spacetime .",
    "various aspects of spacetime geometry fluctuations have been discussed by several authors in recent years , for example  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "stochastic gravity  @xcite has been studied as a systematic approach to go beyond the semiclassical theory . in the present paper , we will concentrate on two issues .",
    "the first is some phenomenological effects of geometry fluctuations in a nearly flat background , which will be discussed in section  [ sec : rtf ] . here",
    "we will be summarising work that was previously published  @xcite .",
    "the second issue will be the possibility of enhancing horizon fluctuations by use of squeezed states , discussed in section  [ sec : enhanced ] . here",
    "we will be summarising work that will developed in more detail in a forthcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will briefly review some of the operational signatures of spacetime geometry fluctuations , and describe how these may be given a geometrical description in terms of the riemann tensor correlation function . here",
    "we direct our attention to the case of a nearly flat background , but the same techniques can be used in more general spacetimes .      the image of a source viewed through a fluctuating medium can undergo variations in apparent brightness . this effect is known to astronomers as scintillation , and to the general public as `` twinkling '' .",
    "the most familiar example arises when stars are viewed through the earth s atmosphere , which is undergoing density fluctuations . in the case of fluctuations of the spacetime geometry",
    ", this effect may be studied using the raychaudhuri equation as a langevin equation  @xcite .",
    "one calculates fluctuations of the expansion @xmath0 . in the case",
    "that the shear , vorticity , and squared expansion can be neglected , this equation becomes @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an affine parameter , @xmath3 is the tangent to the geodesic congruence , and @xmath4 is the ricci tensor . if the expansion vanishes at @xmath5 , then the variance of the expansion becomes @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ricci tensor correlation function .",
    "it is obtained by appropriate contractions of the riemann tensor correlation function and is determined by the stress tensor correlation function .",
    "thus we see that luminosity fluctuations , in lowest order , are signatures of passive fluctuations .",
    "the results of several explicit models are given in  @xcite .",
    "two other effects which can arise when a source is viewed through a fluctuating spacetime geometry are broadening of spectral lines and blurring of images . both of these effects may be given a unified geometric treatment , which we summarise here .",
    "consider a source which is sending successive pulses to a detector as illustrated in figure  [ fig : spacetime ] .",
    "+    the effect of the spacetime geometry is to cause a shift @xmath8 between successive pulses .",
    "this shift can be expressed as an integral of the riemann tensor over the region illustrated : @xmath9 a shift in the time component is observed as a frequency shift , whereas as shift in a spatial component produces a shift in position of the image .",
    "fluctuations of the geometry lead to variations in each of these quantities . denote the fractional line broadening by @xmath10 .",
    "its variance can be expressed as @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the riemann tensor correlation function .",
    "similarly the fluctuations of an image s angular position in a direction defined by the spacelike vector @xmath13 are given by .",
    "several explicit examples of these effects , including enhanced fluctuations due to gravitons in squeezed states , are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "+    in this section , we will briefly review hawking s derivation  @xcite of black hole evaporation .",
    "the basic idea is to consider the spacetime of a black hole formed by gravitational collapse , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : collapse ] . a quantum field propagating in this spacetime",
    "is assumed to be in the in - vacuum state , that is , containing no particles before the collapse . in the case of a massless field ,",
    "a purely positive frequency mode proportional to @xmath15 leaves @xmath16 , propagates through the collapsing body , and reaches @xmath17 after undergoing a large redshift in the region outside of the collapsing matter . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the mode is now a mixture of positive and negative frequency parts , signalling quantum particle creation .",
    "of special interest are the modes which leave @xmath16 just before the formation of the horizon , which is the @xmath18 ray .",
    "these modes give the dominant contribution to the outgoing flux at times long after the black hole has formed . after passing through the collapsing body , they are @xmath19= constant rays , where @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the black hole s mass , and @xmath22 is a constant .",
    "the logarithmic dependence leads to a planckian spectrum of created particles .",
    "it also leads to what some authors call the `` transplanckian problem '' .",
    "we prefer to refer it as the `` transplanckian issue '' , as in our view there may not be any problem . in any case , this is the enormous frequency which the dominant modes must have when they leave @xmath16 .",
    "the typical frequency of the radiated particles reaching @xmath17 midway through the evaporation process is of order @xmath23 , but the typical frequency of these modes at @xmath16 is of order @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the planck mass . another way to state this is to note that the characteristic value of @xmath19 for these modes is of order @xmath26 a geodesic observer who falls from rest at large distance from the black hole will pass from @xmath27 to the horizon at @xmath28 in a proper time of @xmath29 which is far smaller than the planck time . in this sense , the outgoing modes are much less than a planck length outside the horizon .",
    "several authors , especially unruh  @xcite and jacobson  @xcite have noted that it is possible to avoid the use of transplanckian modes provided that the dispersion relation for the quantum field is suitably modified .",
    "this can lead to the phenomenon of `` mode regeneration '' , whereby the modes which become occupied by the thermal radiation do not arise by red - shifting of transplanckian modes , but rather are generated by nonlinear effects just before they are due to be occupied .",
    "this possibility has the benefit of avoiding transplankian frequencies , but the drawback that it requires violation of local lorentz invariance , and hence would depend upon as yet undiscovered physics .    for the case of a bosonic field ,",
    "spontaneous emission implies the possibility of stimulated emission .",
    "however , in the picture described by the original hawking derivation , stimulated emission into modes with wavelengths of order @xmath23 require one to start with an initial state which is populated by particles with transplanckian frequencies .",
    "the possibility of stimulated emission in the case of the hawking effect was first discussed by wald  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the central issue of this paper , that of black hole horizon fluctuations . in classical general relativity ,",
    "the event horizon is the history of the light ray which is marginally trapped by the black hole .",
    "it gives a sharp boundary between events which are visible to the outside , and those which are not .",
    "however , in quantum physics , one does not expect such sharp boundaries , but rather a smeared horizon due to quantum fluctuation effects .",
    "several authors have discussed this possibility from different viewpoints  @xcite .",
    "one approach is to calculate fluctuations in the horizon area  @xcite .",
    "another  @xcite is to study the variation in the times at which rays just outside the classical horizon arrive at a distant observer .",
    "it is the latter approach which will adopted in the present paper .",
    "a crucial question is whether quantum horizon fluctuations will significantly alter the hawking derivation outlined above . given that the outgoing modes which eventually become populated with the thermal radiation spend part of their history less than a planck length outside the mean horizon , it would seem at first that horizon fluctuations could drastically change the result .",
    "fluctuations on the planck scale would seem to cause a significant fraction of the outgoing modes either to fall into the black hole and never reach @xmath17 , or else to be ejected prematurely . in either case",
    ", the thermal character of the hawking radiation would seem to be greatly changed .",
    "this would upset the elegant connection between black hole physics , thermodynamics , and quantum theory .",
    "in fact , the situation is not so dire as it first seems .",
    "ford and svaiter  @xcite gave an estimate of the effects of the active fluctuations when the graviton field is in its vacuum state .",
    "they found that the effects are quite small for black holes whose mass is above the planck scale .",
    "specifically , they calculated variations in the time @xmath30 given in ( [ eq : del - tau ] ) due to the quantum metric fluctuations and found that these fractional variations are small so long as @xmath31 .",
    "squeezed states are capable of enhancing quantum fluctuations beyond the vacuum level .",
    "this raises the possibility of increasing the horizon fluctuations of a black hole by sending in quantum fields in a squeezed vacuum state . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will discuss three models for the source of the fluctuations .",
    "however , first we outline a geometric approach to study the effects of geometry fluctuations on the horizon .",
    "the basic idea is to study the geodesic deviation of the outgoing null geodesics just outside the mean horizon .",
    "+    this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : blackhole2 ] . here",
    "@xmath32 is the separation vector which describes the peeling of the outgoing geodesics from the horizon ( which is hidden in a conformal spacetime diagram ) .",
    "this vector satisfies the geodesic deviation equation , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the tangent to the horizon .",
    "we first consider the solution of this equation in the classical schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this is conveniently done in null kruskal coordinates , in which the schwarzschild metric is @xmath35 the advantage of these coordinates is that @xmath36 , which is constant on ingoing null rays , is an affine parameter for the horizon .",
    "let @xmath37 be an initial point at which @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a constant .",
    "then the solution of ( [ eq : geod ] ) to lowest non - trivial order in @xmath40 , when @xmath41 , is @xmath42 that is , the vector @xmath32 which initially has only a @xmath43-component , develops a @xmath36-component with no change in the @xmath43-component to this order .",
    "the vector is null at the starting point , but afterwards is spacelike with squared norm @xmath44 the growth of @xmath45 describes the peeling of the outgoing geodesic from the horizon .",
    "we now wish to consider the effects of quantum geometry fluctuations .",
    "this may be done by treating ( [ eq : geod ] ) as a langevin equation with a fluctuating part of the riemann tensor , @xmath46 .",
    "the separation vector now becomes a fluctuating vector written as @xmath47 where the contribution from the fluctuations , to lowest order in @xmath40 , is @xmath48 our measure of the effects of the quantum fluctuations will be the variance of @xmath49 .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath40 , this variance may be expressed as @xmath50.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have used the facts that @xmath51 , and that each @xmath52 , as will be demonstrated in each of the explicit models of fluctuations to be considered below .",
    "note that ( [ eq : variance ] ) involves a double integral of the riemann tensor correlation function , as each factor of @xmath53 is an integral over the fluctuating riemann tensor , ( [ eq : del_p ] ) .",
    "first we discuss a simplified model which captures the essential physics of active fluctuations without the complications entailed in treating tensor perturbations in a black hole spacetime . here",
    "the perturbed metric is taken to have the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the unperturbed schwarzschild background metric and @xmath56 is a free quantum scalar field , which we take to satisfy the minimally coupled wave equation @xmath57 in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this is sometimes called a dilaton field , but for our purposes it models the effects of gravitons .",
    "we can expand the operator @xmath56 in terms of a complete set of positive norm wave packets solutions @xmath58 as @xmath59 where the @xmath60 are annihilation operators .",
    "following hawking  @xcite , we define the ingoing wave packets by @xmath61 where @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the usual advanced time coordinate .",
    "the function @xmath64 approaches unity for @xmath65 and approaches a constant of magnitude less than unity , the transmission coefficient , near the horizon .",
    "the integer @xmath66 controls where in frequency space the wave packet is peaked , while @xmath67 controls the width of the wave packet and has units of frequency .",
    "the integer @xmath68 describes which wave packet is under consideration .",
    "this construction allows for wave packets to be sent in at regular intervals of @xmath69 with various frequencies .",
    "thus @xmath70 is the @xmath71 wave packet sent in with component frequencies ranging from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "a corresponding set of outgoing packets can be defined by substitution of @xmath19 for @xmath74 in ( [ eq : monochromatic ] ) .",
    "we now wish to take the quantum state of the scalar field to be a multi - mode squeezed vacuum state for some finite set of wave packet modes , which are sent into the black hole well after the collapse .",
    "let the squeeze parameter of a given mode be @xmath75 , where @xmath66 labels the various excited modes .",
    "we are interested in the effects of the excitation , so we take the difference between the given state and the vacuum state , and also assume that @xmath76 , corresponding to highly excited states .",
    "the function @xmath64 becomes the transmission coefficient near the horizon , where we need to evaluate it .",
    "this transmission coefficient is of order unity for wavelengths shorter than the size of the black hole , @xmath77 , and is approximately @xmath78 when @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a constant of order unity .    in the case that @xmath81 , we find the fractional fluctuations to be approximately @xmath82 ^ 2\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the planck length .",
    "the corresponding result for the low frequency limit , @xmath84 , is @xmath85 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these results may be further simplified to yield the estimates @xmath86 and @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the bandwidth , a characteristic value of the @xmath67 , and we assume that @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the typical peak frequency of the packets .    in principle",
    ", we can make @xmath91 and hence the fractional fluctuations arbitrarily large .",
    "however , we have assumed that the average background spacetime is close to schwarzschild .",
    "this assumption will fail to be valid once the perturbation of the riemann tensor becomes of the same order as the background riemann tensor .",
    "this occurs when @xmath92 if we combine this result with ( [ eq : sg1 ] ) , we see that the back reaction becomes large when the fractional fluctuations in @xmath49 are of order unity .",
    "this is expected , as these fractional fluctuations are determined by the fractional change in curvature .      in this section",
    ", we briefly outline a more realistic model involving gravitons propagating on the schwazlrschild background .",
    "the gravitons are quantized perturbations of the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "classical black hole perturbations have been discussed by many authors , beginning with regge and wheeler  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the regge - wheeler gauge explicit calculations , but as our key object is the gauge invariant riemann tensor correlation function , the results do not depend upon this choice . as in the previous section ,",
    "we consider graviton wave packets in squeezed vacuum states which are sent into the black hole after the collapse .",
    "the details of the calculation are considerably more complicated than in the case of the scalar graviton model , but the results  @xcite are essentially of the same order . specifically , both ( [ eq : sg1 ] ) , ( [ eq : sg1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : sglimit ] ) still apply to the graviton model .",
    "again , one can have the fractional fluctuations in @xmath49 of order unity .      in this model ,",
    "the geometry fluctuations arise from the quantum stress tensor fluctuations of a massless , minimally coupled scalar field . in general ,",
    "the stress tensor correlation function , and hence the riemann tensor correlation function , are singular in the coincidence limit even if the expectation value of the stress tensor has been renormalized .",
    "specifically , one can decompose the stress tensor correlation function into a sum of a fully normal - ordered part , a cross term and a vacuum term .",
    "the latter two terms are singular in the coincidence limit , but can be defined as distributions by an integration by parts procedure  @xcite , or by dimensional regularization  @xcite . for our purposes , it is sufficient to include only the fully normal - ordered term , as this term gives the dominant contribution in the limit of highly excited states . in this limit ,",
    "the approximation of keeping only the fully normal - ordered term is equivalent to that of including only those modes which are excited .",
    "perturbation of the riemann tensor comes entirely from ricci tensor parts in this model and is given by @xmath93\\beta}-g_{\\beta[\\mu}t_{\\nu]\\alpha}-   \\frac{2}{3 } g_{\\alpha[\\mu}g_{\\nu]\\beta}t\\right ] \\,,\\ ] ] where the scalar field stress tensor is @xmath94 the brackets denote anti - symmetrisation and the parentheses symmetrisation .",
    "the scalar field operator @xmath56 is given by ( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : wavepacket ] ) .",
    "the results of lengthy calculations for the fractional fluctuations are @xmath95 ^ 2   \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\frac{e^{2\\rho_k } \\ell_p^2 m}{\\pi\\varepsilon_k }   \\left [ \\int_{k\\varepsilon_k}^{(k+1)\\varepsilon_k}d\\omega'\\ ,   ( \\omega')^{1/2}\\cos\\omega'(v_0+\\delta_k)\\right]^2 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the case @xmath96 , and @xmath97 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\frac{e^{2\\rho_k } \\ell_p^2}{\\pi \\varepsilon_k m }   \\left [ \\int_{k\\varepsilon_k}^{(k+1)\\varepsilon_k}d\\omega'\\ ,    \\sin\\omega ' v_0 \\right]^2\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the case @xmath98 .",
    "note that in contrast to the scalar graviton and graviton models , we now have a double sum over the excited wave packet modes .",
    "this arises from the fact that the riemann tensor correlation function is quartic in the field operators .",
    "we can estimate the fractional fluctuations for the case @xmath99 as @xmath100    comparison with ( [ eq : sg1 ] ) , which hold for both the scalar graviton and graviton models , reveals that the active fluctuations are proportional to @xmath101 , whereas the passive fluctuations are proportional to @xmath102 . in this sense ,",
    "active fluctuations tend to dominate over passive ones .",
    "however , the passive fluctuations grow more rapidly for large @xmath91 .",
    "the point at which the mean background spacetime ceases to be schwarzschild is again when @xmath103",
    "we have discussed the problem of spacetime geometry fluctuations using the riemann tensor correlation function , first near flat spacetime , and then in black hole spacetime . in the former case , we noted some of the operational signatures of spacetime geometry fluctuation : luminosity fluctuations , line broadening , and angular blurring .",
    "however , the main interest is in the problem of black hole horizon fluctuations .",
    "the hawking derivation of black hole radiance invokes transplanckian modes , which must remain extremely close to the event horizon for a very long time , as measured by an external observer . here",
    "extremely close means far less than one planck length as measured by an infalling observer .",
    "this suggests that quantum fluctuations of the horizon might drastically alter black hole radiance .",
    "if this were the case , then the connection between black hole physics and thermodynamics might only be preserved by going to a `` mode - regeneration '' picture based upon a non - linear , non - lorentz invariant dispersion relation . however , a previous study  @xcite of active fluctuations from gravitons in a vacuum state indicated that the vacuum level horizon fluctuations will not upset the hawking derivation for black holes more massive than the planck mass .    in the present paper",
    ", we have summarised an investigation  @xcite which goes further and considers both active and passive fluctuations from squeezed states .",
    "this has the advantage that the level of the fluctuations can be increased by increasing the squeeze parameter .",
    "indeed , we did find that one can the fractional fluctuation in the geodesic deviation vector approach order unity .",
    "however , in all of the models discussed in this paper , the contribution to the quantity @xmath104 come only from the @xmath36-component of @xmath32 , not the @xmath43-component .",
    "if we refer to figure  [ fig : blackhole2 ] , we see that it would require @xmath43-component fluctuations to cause serious problems with modes being prematurely ejected or captured by the black hole .",
    "fluctuations in the @xmath36-component do influence when a given wave packet arrives at @xmath105 .",
    "however , this is likely to be unobservable when the quantum state before collapse is the vacuum state .",
    "these fluctuations could alter stimulated emission , and hence are in principle observable , but would require a state containing particles with transplanckian energies if the stimulated emission is to be observed well after the collapse .    in summary ,",
    "although it is possible to enhance spacetime geometry fluctuations by use of squeezed states , these enhanced fluctuations do not seem to alter the thermal hawking radiation .",
    "thus we conclude that hawking s derivation of black hole radiance is remarkably robust , and that there may be no transplanckian `` problem '' .",
