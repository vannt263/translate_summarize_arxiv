    "pseudo - relativistic dirac hamiltonian frequently emerges as an effective low energy description of quasi - particles in a number of modern day condensed matter systems , such as three dimensional strong @xmath0 topological insulators and weyl semimetals . in two dimensions ,",

    "@xcite , whereas that in graphene can arise from its deliberate wrinkling@xcite .",
    "thus , investigation of the effect of axial magnetic fields in quasi - relativistic systems is of fundamental importance and also experimentally pertinent @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on its effect in a prototype two dimensional dirac system , graphene @xcite .    the time - reversal symmetric axial or pseudo magnetic field in graphene , just like the true one",
    ", quenches the conical dirac dispersion into a set of discrete and highly degenerate _ fictitious _ landau levels , placed at well separated energies when and only if it is uniform .",
    "however , the one at precise zero energy is topologically protected and quite robust against smooth spatial deformation of the strain fields @xcite . otherwise , it receives support from only one of the sublattices ( say @xmath1 ) of honeycomb lattice . on the other hand",
    ", the inevitable existence of a _ boundary _ in a finite strained graphene accommodates an equal number of zero energy states in its surrounding which are localized on the opposite sublattice ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these states are naturally discarded in an infinite system as they grow exponentially towards the boundary @xcite . in this work",
    "we propose a specific modulation of the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping amplitude in graphene with cylindrical boundary ( see fig .",
    "1 ) that mimics the effect of axial magnetic field and captures all the above mentioned features of the zero energy subband .    taking this entire zero energy sub - band into account we show through detail numerical hartree self - consistent calculations that strained graphene can allow the formation of charge - density - wave ( cdw ) even when nn repulsion ( @xmath3 ) is weak by keeping only half of the zero energy states localized in one region ( either bulk or boundary ) or on one sublattice of the system filled .",
    "such ordering , however , does not depend on the detail of system s geometry and we provide numerical evidence of cdw ordering in strained graphene with cylindrical as well as open boundaries for a wide range of _ subcritical _ ( @xmath4 )",
    "nn interaction , where @xmath5 is the critical nn repulsion for the cdw ordering in pristine graphene .",
    "in addition , we illustrate that the scaling of cdw order with axial magnetic fields ( @xmath6 ) is qualitatively similar to the one in the presence of real magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "it exhibits a smooth crossover from linear to sublinear variation with @xmath6 as the strength of weak nn repulsion gradually increases .",
    "finally an almost perfect @xmath7 scaling emerges when the nn repulsion is of the order of the critical one in strain - free graphene @xmath8 .    in additional to sublattice , valley and spin degrees of freedom",
    "also participate in the low energy dynamics in graphene and provide extra degeneracies to the zero energy manifold , allowing the formation of various other orders as well .",
    "for example , spinless fermions in strained graphene can also condense into the topological quantum anomalous hall insulator ( qahi ) phase , representing a chiral scalar , but time - reversal - odd dirac mass@xcite , for weak next - nn ( nnn ) interaction ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , depending on mutual strength of @xmath3 and @xmath9 , weakly interacting pseudo - relativistic fermions ( spinless ) in strained graphene can pair into two topologically distinct dirac vacua . in this work",
    "we show that typically when @xmath10 the cdw is energetically preferred over the qahi and vice - versa .",
    "when fermion spin is restored , possibly the onsite hubbard repulsion drives the leading instability near the dirac point , supporting a magnetic ground state .",
    "recently , through detailed numerical calculation it has been established that the ground state of hubbard model in strained graphene , termed as _ global anti - ferromagnet_@xcite , through the formation of two ferromagnetic domains with opposite and equal magnetization in bulk and boundary globally leads to only an anti - ferromagnet order of same sign everywhere in the system , while the space - integrated magnetization gets pinned to zero@xcite . nevertheless , when the chemical potential is placed away from the dirac point , competing cdw , topological quantum anomalous / spin hall insulators@xcite lead to further splittings of the shifted zero energy subband .",
    "we argue that when appearance of cdw is preceded by the formation of global - antiferromagnet , the remaining zeroband goes through a full spin polarization .",
    "hence , cdw ordering at finite doping in strained graphene is accompanied by a ferromagnet order .",
    "we also show that by continuously tuning the chemical potential away from the charge neutrality point a rich variety of interaction driven broken symmetry phases can be observed in strained graphene .",
    "rest of the discussion is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we illustrate a particular way of realizing axial magnetic field in graphene with cylindrical boundary and demonstrate the sublattice entanglement of the zero modes in that system from the computation of local density of states ( ldos ) . in sec .",

    "@xmath121 , @xmath157 are respectively the self - consistent cdw and qahi order parameters per unit cell in the @xmath120 ring around the center . comparing the free energies obtained from the self - consistent solutions of these two order parameters in a system with 600 sites ( @xmath158 ) , in the presence of roughly uniform axial magnetic field ( with @xmath119 ) , we extract a representative phase diagram in the @xmath11 plane , shown in fig .  7 ( bottom ) .",
    "thus when the nn interaction substantially dominates over the nnn one , system finds itself in the cdw phase , and vice - versa . at the transition between these two states only one of the dirac points",
    "remains fully gapped while the other one becomes gapless and system then simultaneously supports finite @xmath159 and quantized @xmath160 . across the phase boundary between cdw and qahi",
    "although the zeroth landau levels go through a smooth _",
    "level crossing _",
    "( see fig .",
    "7 ) , both the order parameters jump discontinuously . therefore , within the framework of _ restricted hartree - fock _ analysis",
    ", we perform here , the transition between cdw and qahi states is _ discontinuous _ in nature .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in pristine graphene cdw and qahi are separated by either the semimetallic dirac vacuum ( when @xmath161 are weak ) or the kekule bond - density - wave order ( when strong @xmath161 are comparable)@xcite .",
    "thus a direct transition between cdw and qahi gets avoided in strain - free graphene . on the other hand , due the presence of a large number of states near the charge - neutrality point ,",
    "dirac semimetal gets vanquished in strained graphene for arbitrarily weak interactions , whereas the kekule order can not develop any finite expectation value at least for weak repulsions due to the spatial separation of the zero modes localized on two sublattices .",
    "therefore , strained graphene offers an ideal platform to study a topological phase transition between qahi and cdw at weak couplings , the exact nature of which , although believed to be a continuous one in the absence of axial fields @xcite , remains enigmatic thus far .",
    "therefore , unrestricted hartee - fock analysis can provide further insight into the exact nature of this transition in strained graphene , which we leave for future investigation .",
    "recently it has been argued that axial gauge potentials , @xmath162 and @xmath163 in eq .",
    "( [ genaxial ] ) , arise from translation symmetry breaking cdw orders @xcite .",
    "these non - abelian components of the axial gauge fields can , for example , be realized by introducing an appropriate _ super - lattice potential _ induced by the substrate on which graphene is placed @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that a particular hartree decomposition of the nnn repulsion @xmath142 in eq .",
    "( [ nnnhamil ] ) yields local expectation values of @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "however , we strongly believe that nnn repulsion selects the qahi phase over the modulated cdw orders , at least when it is weak @xmath164 , for the following reason .",
    "since the qahi represents a chiral symmetric but time - reversal - odd dirac mass , it pushes down all the filled states below the chemical potential , besides splitting the zero subband . on the other hand , @xmath165 and @xmath166 components of the @xmath47 chiral / axial gauge field , commute with the dirac hamiltonian @xmath57 $ ] and possibly gain energy only by splitting the zeroth landau level , and hence likely to be energetically inferior to qahi .        through a detailed numerical analysis in pristine graphene",
    ", it has been argued that as one increases the strength of the nnn interaction@xcite , the dirac semi - metal first enters into the qahi phase when @xmath167 . only upon further increasing @xmath168",
    ", system enters into the translational symmetry breaking cdw phase , where @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , variational approach , monte - carlo simulation with the nnn interaction in strained graphene can provide valuable insights into this competition .",
    "however , existence of a boundary ( inevitably present in strained graphene ) will possibly play a crucial role in these studies , since qahi supports chiral edge states near the boundary .",
    "interestingly , exact diagonalization studies in small clusters with periodic boundary have not found any sign of topological ordering in graphene @xcite , while a similar study in the presence of an open boundary clearly exhibits the existence of qahi state in pristine graphene @xcite .",
    "appearance of qahi phase at strong enough @xmath9 in pristine graphene has also been supported in a variational monte - carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the generic splitting of zeroth landau level upon including all three , sublattice , valley and spin , degrees of freedom . assuming that onsite hubbard repulsion is the dominant component among the finite - range coulomb repulsions , various possible splittings of the zero energy subband are shown in fig .",
    "8 . with the restoration of fermion",
    "s spin additional orders that lack @xmath47 spin rotational symmetry can also set in at weak interactions .",
    "the possible orders include a magnetic ground state@xcite , and quantum spin hall insulator(qshi ) @xcite .",
    "although a hund s flat band ferromagnet may appear as a natural ground state for hubbard model in strained graphene , which , nevertheless , is true _ locally _ , recent numerical simulations suggest that the magnetic ordering near the dirac point contains a richer structure . in the magnetic phase ,",
    "the local ferromagnetic order changes its sign as one approaches the boundary from the bulk , which then leads to net zero _ space - integrated _ ferromagnetic moment . on the other hand , due to their support on opposite sublattices in these two regions ,",
    "the zero energy states also give rise to an antiferromagnet order , which , on the other hand , is of same sign in the entire system , and the true magnetic ground state is an antiferromagnet , however , only _ _ globally__@xcite .",
    "such ordering possibly leads to dominant instability near the charge - neutrality point , since the onsite repulsion is the strongest component of the coulomb interaction@xcite , and the resulting splitting of the pseudo zeroth landau level is shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) .    when the nn repulsion is stronger than the nnn one , the dominant subleading splitting of the zeroth pseudo landau level as the chemical potential @xmath133 , takes place through the formation of cdw , as shown in fig .",
    "8(b , iii ) .",
    "in addition , it also causes complete spin polarization of the remaining zero energy subband , and simultaneously supports a ferromagnet moment . upon taking the chemical potential further away from the dirac point , as @xmath170 in fig .  8(c , iii )",
    ", qahi is stabilized for arbitrarily weak nnn interaction .    a slightly longer range coulomb interaction , the second nearest - neighbor repulsion ( @xmath9 ) among the electrons can , in principle , support qshi as well as qahi ; both leading to relativistic mass gaps in pristine graphene when @xmath9 is sufficiently strong@xcite .",
    "otherwise , the orientation of the intra - sublattice circulating current in the _ time - reversal - symmetric _ qshi phase changes its sign upon exchanging the spin - projection as well as sublattice . however , due to the presence of aforementioned large density of states in the vicinity of the dirac point , an interplay among these two orders can be realized even for weak @xmath9 , when the graphene flake is subject to axial magnetic fields .",
    "the dominant subleading splittings of the zero subband driven by these two orders are shown in figs",
    ".  8 ( b , i ) and 8 ( b , ii ) , respectively .",
    "although these two ground states are exactly degenerate at the mean - field level , upon analyzing the strength of the pertinent renormalized interaction couplings at a scale @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the axial magnetic length and @xmath173 is the lattice spacing , it has been argued that the tendency towards the formation of the qshi is _ slightly _ favored over the qahi@xcite , similar to the situation at strong couplings in strain - free graphene@xcite .",
    "thus , at least when @xmath174 , and @xmath133 , system can further lower its energy by developing qshi , which supports a _",
    "quantized spin hall conductance _ @xmath175 .",
    "finally , upon taking the chemical potential close to the qshi / qahi gap ( @xmath170 , see fig .",
    "8 ( c , i / ii ) ) , a cdw order develops in the system , which once again fully polarizes the spin of remaining zero modes .",
    "otherwise , depending on the appearance of qshi or qahi as @xmath133 , cdw realized at @xmath176 supports a quantized ( @xmath177 ) charge or spin hall conductance , due to the presence of an accompanying anomalous or spin hall insulator order , respectively .",
    "therefore , depending on the relative strength of various finite range components of the coulomb interaction , which possibly can be tuned to certain degree at least in _ _ molecular graphene__@xcite , strained graphene may exhibit a wide variety of interaction driven splitting of the topological zero energy subband .",
    "to summarize , we here demonstrate that strain in graphene , through binding a large number of states at the dirac point , can be conducive for various orderings , in the presence of weak repulsive interactions .",
    "these special zero energy modes , however , reside on opposite sublattices in the bulk and near the edge of the system .",
    "a detailed numerical hartree self - consistent calculation shows that weak nn interaction ( @xmath3 ) can remove the sublattice degeneracy from the zero energy subband by spontaneously developing a density imbalance between the bulk and boundary , which simultaneously generates a staggered pattern of charge among two sublattices of honeycomb lattice as well .",
    "the cdw order exhibits a crossover from linear to sublinear scaling with the axial field @xmath178 as the subcritical nn repulsion gets stronger and an almost perfect @xmath7 scaling emerges at zero axial field criticality @xmath8 , resembling in this regard its scaling in real magnetic field@xcite , and the scaling of qahi in axial fields@xcite .",
    "taking the valley and spin degrees of freedom into account , we argue that various other orders , such as a magnetic ground state , qahi , qshi , can also set in at and near the dirac points in strained graphene .",
    "while the onsite repulsion supports a magnetic ground state , the nnn interaction ( @xmath9 ) can stabilize qahi or qshi phase .",
    "although various works studied the instability of dirac fermions in strained graphene previously in the presence of nnn and onsite repulsion , respectively supporting topological insulators @xcite and magnetic order @xcite , competitions among these orders as well as that with the cdw order have been overlooked . in this work",
    "we address these issues in details . within the framework of a @xmath11 model for the spinless fermions",
    ", we here address the competition between cdw and qahi in a half - filled strained honeycomb lattice and show that roughly when @xmath179 the qahi is energetically favored over cdw and vice - versa .",
    "possibly the onsite repulsion is the strongest coulomb interaction and drives the zero energy subband in strained graphene towards the formation of an unconventional magnetic ordering , _ global anti - ferromagnet _ , at the dirac point . nevertheless , the remaining orders , namely cdw , qahi and qshi , lead to further splitting of the shifted zero modes , upon continuously tuning the chemical potential away from the charge - neutrality point .",
    "although our discussions strictly focuses on the effect of time - reversal - symmetric axial magnetic fields , they are equally applicable even when a true ( time - reversal - symmetry breaking ) magnetic field penetrates strained graphene , but the axial one is stronger .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hdpseudo ] ) , in the presence of both real and pseudo magnetic field generalizes to@xcite @xmath180=\\sigma_0 \\otimes i\\gamma_0 \\sum_{\\nu=1,2 } \\gamma_\\nu \\left(\\hat{p}_\\nu -a_\\nu - i \\gamma_{3 } \\gamma_{5 } a_\\nu ( \\vec{x } ) \\right),\\ ] ] upon restoring the spin degrees of freedom ( represented by the first pauli matrix @xmath181 ) .",
    "the real magnetic field @xmath2 is given by @xmath182 , and it is set to be perpendicular to graphene plane , thus @xmath183 . when both the fields are uniform and @xmath184 , the effective magnetic fields at two the valleys ( @xmath18 ) @xmath185 , still point in opposite directions , and the landau levels at finite energies appear at @xmath186 for each spin component , where @xmath187 , with @xmath188 .",
    "even in this set up , system continues to host topologically protected zero energy subband @xmath189 , and the areal degeneracy of all the landau levels , localized near @xmath18 valley is @xmath190@xcite .",
    "the zero energy states on @xmath191 sublattice live in the bulk ( near the boundary ) of the system , as long as @xmath184 . therefore , onsite repulsion in this system as well can support the unconventional magnetic ground state at half - filling , shown in fig .",
    "furthermore , the proposed interplay among cdw , qahi , and qshi orders , resulting in the subleading splittings of the shifted zero modes at finite doping , shown through fig .",
    "8(b ) and 8(c ) , holds even when strained graphene is placed in a weak true magnetic field ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "however , due to the single - particle zeeman coupling , represented by @xmath192 , where @xmath193 in graphene , spin - rotational symmetry breaking orders , e.g. global antiferromagnet and qshi , get projected onto the _ spin easy - plane_.    therefore , strained graphene , apart from its potential applicability in semiconductor industry due to the resulting valley dependent gauge fields , and possibility of isolating the  valley - charge \" @xcite , also provide a unique opportunity to observe various broken symmetry phases@xcite , as well as proximity induced unconventional superconductivity@xcite .",
    "recent progress in achieving strained induced axial magnetic fields in regular@xcite and molecular graphene@xcite , over a range @xmath194 t , proposal of valley - gauge fields in cold atom systems@xcite , possible connection of strained graphene with dirac equation in curved space@xcite , together with the theoretical interests in understanding the competition among distinct topological ground states , their microscopic origins in low dimensional systems@xcite , make our study interesting , timely and experimentally relevant .",
    "sublattice degeneracy of the zero energy manifold in a finite size graphene can be argued in the following way . as mentioned , in finite systems",
    "generically there is no state at exact zero energy .",
    "however , for any two states @xmath195 , placed at energies @xmath196 , the symmetric and the anti - symmetric combinations of @xmath195 , say @xmath197 and @xmath198 , reside on @xmath1 and @xmath2 sublattices , respectively , for example .",
