    "in fact , assuming that the reheating temperature after inflation is below @xmath13 and that there is no dilution by , e.g. , late decays of particles beyond the standard model , the expected cosmic mass fraction in qcd axion cdm is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the initial misalignment angle .    therefore , the qcd axion is necessarily associated with a very high energy scale and so it is natural to search for it in ultra - violet completions of the standard model such as string theory .",
    "indeed , it has long been known that the low - energy effective field theory of string compactifications predicts natural candidates for the qcd axion  @xcite , often even an ` axiverse '  @xcite , containing many additional light axion - like particles ( alps ) whose masses are logarithmically hierarchical .",

    "string theory requires the existence of six extra space dimensions , which appear to be unobservable because they are supposed to be compact and of very small size .",
    "string phenomenology is then the attempt to make contact between the perturbative ten dimensional ( 10d ) effective field theories ( efts ) describing the massless degrees of freedom of string theory at very high energies  say , the heterotic or type ii ( with @xmath31-branes ) eft  and the low energy physics in our 4d real world .",
    "in fact , different 4d low energy efts emerge depending on the eft to start with in 10d .",
    "one of the fundamental tasks of string phenomenology is to find a compactification whose low energy eft reproduces ( a suitable extension of ) the standard model . along this way it is also mandatory to understand moduli stabilisation : expectation values of the moduli fields , which parameterise the shape and size of the extra dimensions , determine many parameters of the low energy eft , such as gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "often , one needs to incorporate quantum corrections in order to fix many of these expectation values and to give their associated particle excitations a non - zero mass .",
    "moduli stabilisation is best understood in type iib string flux compactifications , on which we concentrate in the following .",
    "they provide explicit and well motivated realisations of brane world scenarios : the standard model is supposed to live on a stack of space - time filling branes wrapping cycles in the compact dimensions , while gravity propagates in the bulk , leading to a string scale @xmath32 possibly much smaller than the planck scale @xmath33 , at the expense of a large compactification volume @xmath34 ( in units of the string length ) .",
    "importantly , axion - like fields emerge in those compactifications inevitably as kaluza - klein zero modes of ten dimensional form fields , as we will review in the following subsection",
    ".      we will consider here type iib flux compactifications on calabi - yau orientifolds @xmath35 in the presence of space - time filling @xmath36 branes and @xmath37 planes .",
    "below the kaluza - klein scale @xmath38 , they lead to a low - energy @xmath39 ( supergravity ) eft in 4d .",
    "their 4d closed string moduli , comprised by the axio - dilaton @xmath40 , the complex structure moduli @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and the khler moduli , @xmath43 are obtained via the kaluza - klein reduction of the massless bosonic fields of the original 10d theory  the latter including , in the ramond - ramond sector , the forms @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and , in the neveu schwarz - neveu schwarz sector , the dilaton @xmath46 .",
    "importantly , the number of khler moduli @xmath47 is determined by the topology of @xmath35 , namely the number of inequivalent four - cycles @xmath48 of @xmath35 ( we have specialised for convenience to orientifold projections such that @xmath49 ) .",
    "their imaginary parts @xmath50 have all the properties of axion - like fields , as we will see next .",
    "as already mentioned , ( a suitable extension of ) the standard model is realised in such compactifications through ( stacks of ) space - time filling @xmath36-branes wrapping some of the four - cycles @xmath48 . at low energies ,",
    "the dynamics of a @xmath36-brane reduces to a @xmath51 gauge theory that lives on its eight - dimensional world - volume .",
    "moreover , @xmath36-branes can be magnetised by turning on internal magnetic fluxes @xmath52 . taking all these effects into account , the 4d low energy effective lagrangian of the axion - like fields @xmath50 , including the brane - localised @xmath51 gauge bosons @xmath53 ,",
    "is obtained from the kaluza - klein reduction of the @xmath36-brane action as follows  @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 gev is the reduced planck mass , while the various other quantities in eq .",
    "are defined as follows :    * the khler metric @xmath56 , describing the kinetic mixing of the axion - like fields , is obtained via @xmath57 from the khler potential , the latter taking , at tree - level , the following form : @xmath58 it depends implicitly on the complex structure moduli via the holomorphic ( 3,0)-form @xmath59 and on the khler moduli via the calabi - yau volume @xmath60 , measured by an einstein frame metric @xmath61 , and expressed in units of the string length @xmath62 , in terms of its tension @xmath63 , @xmath64 here , the khler form @xmath65 has been expanded , in a basis @xmath66 of @xmath67 of two - forms which are poincar dual to @xmath68 , as @xmath69 , and we denoted the triple intersection numbers of @xmath35 by @xmath70 .",
    "the volume , the khler form and ultimately the khler metric can then be obtained as a function of the @xmath71 by inverting the following relations : @xmath72 the string scale @xmath73 is obtained from the dimensional reduction of the iib supergravity action , @xmath74 * the couplings @xmath75 appearing in the gauge kinetic term and in the axionic couplings to gauge bosons , the respective last terms in both lines of eq .  , are the expansion coefficients of the two form @xmath76 , @xmath77 where the basic forms satisfy @xmath78 .",
    "the gauge coupling can be inferred from the gauge kinetic term as @xmath79 * the couplings @xmath80 appearing in the ( stckelberg ) mass terms for the @xmath51 gauge fields @xmath53 in eq .",
    "are given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the gauge flux on @xmath48 .",
    "axions @xmath83 experiencing such a coupling disappear from the low energy eft because they are eaten by the corresponding @xmath51 gauge boson  @xcite .    thus , it appears from eq .",
    ", that iib string flux compactifications have potentially many , @xmath84 , axion candidates @xmath50 , where @xmath85 is the number of @xmath51 bosons @xmath53 which get a stckelberg mass by eating the associated axions .",
    "however , before reaching this conclusion one has to consider perturbative and non - perturbative corrections to this tree - level result .",
    "in fact , such corrections are necessarily to be taken into account in the course of the stabilisation of the associated khler moduli @xmath86 .",
    "importantly , the mechanisms to fix the @xmath86 may also generate large masses for the corresponding axions @xmath50",
    "@xcite , as we will see next .      in iib",
    "string flux compactifications , the tree - level superpotential  @xcite @xmath87 which is generated by turning on background fluxes of the form @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 , does not depend on the khler moduli , but on the dilaton @xmath91 and the complex structure moduli @xmath92 .",
    "this implies that the dilaton and the complex structure moduli can be fixed at tree - level by imposing vanishing f - term conditions  @xcite . by appropriate tuning of the internal fluxes ,",
    "one can always fix the dilaton such that the string coupling , @xmath93 , is in the perturbative regime .",
    "further effects from fixing @xmath94 and @xmath95 are then parametrised by the flux - dependent constant @xmath96 and by an overall factor in the f - term scalar potential arising from the @xmath94 and @xmath95 dependent part in the tree - level khler potential .",
    "the khler moduli @xmath86 , however , remain precisely massless at leading semiclassical order , because of the no - scale structure of @xmath97 .",
    "their stabilisation requires taking into acount perturbative ( p ) and nonperturbative ( np ) @xmath63 and @xmath98 corrections to the tree - level result , @xmath99 eventually leading also to non - trivial potentials , i.e. masses , for the axions @xmath50 associated with the scalars @xmath86 . these masses can arise , however , only via the non - perturbative corrections to the superpotential , @xmath100 , and to the khler potential , @xmath101 : only those can break the shift symmetry of the axions @xmath50 .",
    "the respective order of magnitude of the perturbative versus the nonperturbative corrections to the scalar potential is set by @xmath102 .",
    "the main mechanisms proposed for @xmath103 moduli stabilisation and their consequences for the physics of their associated @xmath104 axions can be characterised as follows :    * the first scenario of khler moduli stabilisation in iib string compactifications neglected the corrections to the khler potential and considered only the non - perturbative corrections to the superpotential  @xcite , @xmath105 which arises by @xmath106 instantons ( in which case @xmath107 ) or by stacks of @xmath36 branes supporting a condensing gauge theory ( for which @xmath108 with @xmath109 being the coefficient of the one - loop beta function ) , wrapping the four - cycles @xmath48 .",
    "the threshold effects @xmath53 can be considered as @xmath110 constants since they depend on the complex structure moduli which are flux - stabilised at tree - level .",
    "the four - cycle volumina are then fixed at @xmath111 thus , @xmath102 has to be fine - tuned to extremely small values , @xmath112 , in order that the volume is large , @xmath113 , the latter being a prerequisite of the underlying supergravity approximation .",
    "therefore , in these scenarios it is extremely hard to lower the string scale much below the planck scale .",
    "moreover , since the axionic shift symmetry @xmath114 of all axions is broken non - perturbatively by eq .  , all the axion candidates get a large mass of the order of the mass of the particle excitations of the associated khler moduli ( the so - called  saxions \" ) , @xmath115 leaving no candidate for a qcd axion  @xcite , let alone a light alp .",
    "* this can be avoided if the non - pertubative effects arise from wrapping an _ ample _ four - cycle , @xmath116 in terms of a basis @xmath117 of @xmath118 , resulting in a contribution to the superpotential of the form @xmath119 in this case , by fine - tuning @xmath120 , this single non - perturbative effect can generate a minimum for all the khler moduli @xmath86 within the regime of validity of the eft  @xcite .",
    "however it can lift only one axion corresponding to the imaginary part of the ample divisor modulus : @xmath121 .",
    "all the remaining @xmath122 axions are massless at leading order and develop a potential only via tiny higher order instanton effects of the form  @xcite : @xmath123 where @xmath47 is a combination of moduli orthogonal to @xmath124 @xmath125 .",
    "+ thus , this moduli stabilisation scenario gives rise to an axiverse  @xcite : possibly many , @xmath122 , axions which acquire a mass spectrum which is logarithmically hierarchical .",
    "this number may still be diminished in case that some of the axions are eaten by the stckelberg mechanism to provide masses to brane - localised @xmath51 gauge bosons . +",
    "two main concerns regarding the microscopic realisation of this scenario are related to the difficulty to find an ample divisor which is rigid ( and so definitely receives non - perturbative effects ) , and the possibility to choose gauge fluxes that avoid chiral intersections between the instanton and the visible sector .",
    "moreover , it should be noted that in this case again very large volumina are not possible : the string scale is expected not much below the planck scale , of order the gut scale . *",
    "the latter difficulties are avoided in the large volume scenario ( lvs ) , which realizes the possibility of exponentially large volumina for generic values of @xmath126  @xcite and allows for the construction of explicit globally and locally consistent calabi - yau examples with magnetised d7-branes , realising mssm or gut like chiral extensions of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "+ the lvs requires the existence of a single _ del pezzo _ four - cycle @xmath127 which guarantees the emergence of a non - perturbative contribution to the superpotential @xmath128 via an @xmath106 instanton or gaugino condensation .",
    "this effect fixes @xmath127 at a small size and gives the corresponding saxion and axion a large mass  @xcite , @xmath129 all the other @xmath103 moduli are stabilised perturbatively by @xmath63 or @xmath98 effects or by d - terms arising from magnetised branes .",
    "the exponential large volume emerges from an interplay between the non - perturbative contribution associated with del pezzo cycle and the leading @xmath63 correction  @xcite : @xmath130 which yields , for @xmath131 ( i.e. negative euler number ) , a supersymmetry - breaking anti de sitter ( ads ) minimum at exponentially large volume  @xcite : @xmath132 + hence only one axion , @xmath133 , becomes heavy whereas all the other ones ( except those eaten up by anomalous @xmath51s , whose scalar partners are fixed by the above mentioned d - terms ) remain light and develop a potential via subleading higher order instanton effects . + schematic picture of the simplest swiss - cheese setup of a compactification in the large volume scenario : a big four - cycle ( = divisor ) @xmath134 with exponentially large volume @xmath135 ; a del pezzo divisor @xmath136 supporting the leading non - perturbative effect ( @xmath106 instanton or gaugino condensation of a pure yang - mills theory described by a stack of @xmath36 branes ) ; a rigid divisor @xmath137 supporting the stack of @xmath36 branes describing the visible sector ; a rigid divisor @xmath138 intersecting with @xmath137 and supporting a stack of magnetised @xmath36 branes for d - term stabilisation.,scaledwidth=35.0% ] + the simplest version of a standard lvs is build upon a swiss - cheese calabi - yau three - fold with volume given by @xcite : @xmath139 it is dominated by the exponentially large volume @xmath140 of one of the four - cycles , @xmath134 , while all the other , @xmath122 , four - cycles are small .",
    "+ importantly , the realisation of an lvs requires @xmath141 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : lvs ] ) : a single del pezzo divisor @xmath136 to support the non - perturbative effects , one big four - cycle @xmath142 to parametrise the large volume , @xmath143 , one small rigid four - cycle @xmath137 to support the stack of space - time filling magnetised d7-branes corresponding to ( a suitable extension of ) the mssm and intersecting with another small cycle @xmath138 whose brane setup is there to provide d - terms which stabilise @xmath144 and thus the visible sector gauge coupling @xmath145 .",
    "two of the @xmath141 axion - like fields disappear from the low energy spectrum , however : @xmath146 , as explained above , and @xmath147 , which is eaten by the stckelberg mechanism .",
    "thus , realisations of the lvs axiverse involve at least two light axions : one qcd axion candidate plus one alp  @xcite .",
    "more generic models for @xmath148 very large will include an arbitrarily large number of alps . +",
    "the main scales in the model are : @xmath149 the numerical values have been given for generic values of the underlying parameters , @xmath150 , and for a volume @xmath151 , demonstrating that , for an intermediate string scale , the lvs naturally realises tev - scale susy . *",
    "finally , the contributions from both @xmath152 and non - perturbative terms in the superpotential @xmath153 from gaugino condensation on stacks of 4-cycle wrapping @xmath36 branes allow for a 2nd branch of supersymmetry breaking  khler uplifted \" vacua distinct from the lvs branch .",
    "these vacua can be either ads , minkowski or ds by themselves without any need for further ` external ' sources of uplifting .",
    "their possible existence was first pointed out in  @xcite , while they were shown to be viable in producing controlled large - volume vacua for all moduli in a supergravity analysis  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite provided the first explicit global and consistent f - theory constructions of such khler uplifted ds vacua . on swiss - cheese",
    "calabi - yau threefolds the khler uplifting branch generates a class of minima for the volume moduli , where @xmath154 with @xmath155 the rank of the condensing gauge group of the @xmath36 brane stack wrapping the large divisor @xmath134 .",
    "the blow - up khler moduli @xmath156 are stabilised at smaller volume dictated by the rank of the corresponding condensing gauge groups . for ranks @xmath157",
    "this leads to stabilisation of all khler moduli at an overall volume @xmath158 , with volume moduli masses suppressed by a factor @xmath159 compared the masses of the complex structure moduli and the axio - dilaton from fluxes .",
    "so far , stabilisation of the @xmath148 @xmath86 moduli utilises an identical number of non - perturbative contributions to the superpotential from gaugino condensation . hence , all associated @xmath50 axions are rendered massive with mass scales tied to their scalar partners .",
    "khler uplifting with an ( partially ) ample divisor utilising less than @xmath148 instanton effects for stabilisation and in turn realising an axiverse represents an open question .",
    "let us know for the remainder of this review concentrate on the lvs , because , as we have seen , it predicts the existence of a qcd axion candidate plus at least one alp .",
    "their decay constants @xmath160 and their couplings @xmath161 to gauge bosons ( or matter fields ) @xmath26 can be read off from the matching of the prediction   with the generalisation of the generic low energy effective lagrangian   to the case of many axion - like fields , by transforming in the former from the original basis @xmath162 to a basis of fields @xmath163 with canonically normalised kinetic terms  @xcite . for the simple swiss - cheese calabi - yau setup discussed above and illustrated in fig .",

    "a range of values for the proper qcd axion decay constant , spanning the classic qcd axion window , @xmath171 are then possible depending upon the exact numerical coefficients , the value of the gravitino mass @xmath172  tev , and the tuning of @xmath173 and @xmath102 .",
    "the large cycle alp @xmath166 has a smaller decay constant @xmath174 , but its coupling to the standard model gauge bosons is completely negligible , @xmath175 .    more alps , but with decay constant similar to the one of the qcd axion , @xmath176 and coupling to gauge bosons other than the gluon similar to the one of the qcd axion , @xmath177 are obtained , if there are more small cycles @xmath178 intersecting the visible branes , but without introducing additional d - term conditions .",
    "their masses are expected to be smaller than the mass of the qcd axion and to be distributed logarithmically hierarchical  @xcite , @xmath179    these findings have been reproduced also in explicit constructions of lvs examples , exploiting concrete calabi - yau orientifolds and semi - realistic @xmath36-brane and flux setups  @xcite .",
