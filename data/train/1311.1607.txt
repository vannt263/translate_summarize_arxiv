    "therefore theoretical input is most welcome . to investigate @xmath2 we use the framework of perturbative qcd where we apply a generalization of the , so - called , handbag approach .",
    "a handbag mechanism has been first developed to study deeply virtual compton scattering and meson production @xcite ; in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been extended to the flavor off - diagonal case , which comes across here . for our studies of @xmath2 we go along similar lines of argumentation as for @xmath3 in ref .  @xcite . under physically plausible assumptions",
    "we argue that our process under consideration factorizes into a hard partonic subprocess amplitude and soft hadronic transition matrix elements . in doing so the hard energy scale justifying this splitting and the treatment of the partonic subprocess within perturbation theory",
    "is set by the heavy charm - quark mass @xmath4 . in our investigations",
    "we only take the valence fock states of the hadrons into account and consider the proton in a quark - diquark picture .",
    "the soft hadronic transition matrix elements can in principle be parametrized by transition distribution amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we here represent them as an overlap of hadron light - cone wave functions ( lcwfs ) analogously as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "before we turn to the description of @xmath2 within a double - handbag approach we would like to specify the kinematics chosen to describe the process .",

    "it parametrizes the relative momentum transfer between the proton and the @xmath7 in the light - cone plus direction .",
    "considering @xmath2 in the double - handbag mechanism means that the process amplitude can be split up into a nonperturbative part describing the soft hadronic @xmath23 and @xmath24 transitions and into a perturbative subprocess on the partonic level . in the latter only the minimal number of hadronic constituents which are necessary to convert the initial @xmath25 into the final @xmath26 pair take part actively . in our investigations",

    "the soft hadronic transitions ( [ eq : lc - p - to - dbar - transition - matrix - element ] ) and ( [ eq : lc - pbar - to - d - transition - matrix - element ] ) are hadronic matrix elements with respect to the incoming ( anti)proton and the outgoing @xmath7 ( @xmath17 ) states of appropriate @xmath38-quark and @xmath27$]-diquark field operators . the action of the field operators in eq .",

    "we will only discuss the @xmath33 transition , since one can proceed in complete analogy for the @xmath34 one . within the light - cone quantum field",
    "theoretical framework we apply the fourier representation of the field operators as well as the fock - state decomposition of the hadron states in eq .",

    "each fock - state component , @xmath42u \\,\\rangle$ ] for the proton and @xmath43 for the @xmath7 , comes with a lcwf as a prefactor .",
    "furthermore , we only take into account lcwfs where we neglect partonic orbital angular momenta , such that the helicities of the partons add up to the parent hadron helicity .",
    "thus we need only two lcwfs : one for the proton and one for the @xmath7 , which we call @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "such hadronic lcwfs only depend on the relative parton momenta with respect to the parent hadron momentum , but not on the total hadron momentum .    before stating the result for the @xmath2 amplitude after applying the overlap representation , we first take into account the fact that according to refs .",
    "@xcite the d - meson wave function is strongly peaked around @xmath46 with respect to its momentum fraction dependence .",
    "this behavior is also inherited by the lcwf overlap such that it notably weights momentum fraction close to the peak position in the hard scattering amplitude .",
    "it is therefore possible to replace the momentum fractions inside the hard - scattering amplitude by their peak position and to take the subprocess amplitude out of the convolution integral .",

    ". refs .  @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain model results for the @xmath2 cross sections we have to specify the model lcwfs for the proton and the d meson which appear in the overlap representation . we take the wave functions as have been used in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath55 for the proton and the @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the arguments of the lcwfs are the relative momentum fractions @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the intrinsic transverse momenta @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the active constituents inside the proton and the @xmath7 , respectively , with respect to their parent hadron momenta .",
    "the @xmath7 wave function has its peak around @xmath60 through its gaussian mass exponential .",
    "the free parameters appearing in each wave function , namely the normalization constant @xmath61 and the transverse size parameter @xmath62 , can be fixed by requirering a specific value for the root - mean - square of the intrinsic transverse momentum of the active constituent and the valence fock - state probability or decay constant .",
    "i.e. , the model parameters can thus be associated with physical parameters .",
    "choosing @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the proton and @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the d meson @xcite gives : @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",

    "we have plotted it as a function of @xmath73 for different values of mandelstam @xmath74 , namely @xmath75 and @xmath76 corresponding to the dotted , dashed and solid lines , respectively .",
    "one observes that the magnitude of the overlap decreases with increasing cms energies @xmath74 and , for all values of mandelstam @xmath74 , it shows an increase when going to small scattering angles .         on the left - hand side of fig .",
