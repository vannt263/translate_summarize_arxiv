    "the first terms @xmath13 are the free hamiltonians of each double quantum dot that include the single electron energy level of each quantum dot and the coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "the terms that express the application of gate voltages for the coherent tunneling are given by : @xmath14 where the first order term refers to the tunneling of the electron embedded in one quantum dot @xcite and the second order term refers instead to the simultaneous passage of the pair of the electrons contained in the second quantum dot .",
    "other first order transitions involving the electrons in the doubly occupied quantum dot are forbidden by selection rule on the energy .",
    "the series of pulses @xmath15 considered in the framework of adiabatic tunneling are of gaussian shape @xcite . in particular",
    "the intermediate pulses are equal among them but distinct from the external ones that are applied in a counter - intuitive sequence @xcite , that is from the tail to the head of the chain in such a way that @xmath10 is applied before @xmath8 .",
    "it has a significant advantages in enabling high fidelity transfer .",

    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the shape of the gaussian pulses adopted in the following , where the intermediate pulse @xmath23 has an amplitude 10 times greater than the amplitude @xmath21 of the external pulses to achieve high fidelity transfer as reported in ref.@xcite and where the values for @xmath24 and @xmath19 are fixed .    , for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we point out that in our case the last double quantum dot of the chain is tuned identically to the first and , during the passage , the chain forms a single quantum system . during the time evolution of such single system",
    ", there is no heat exchange and energy remains constant .",
    "the final state can not be made of two electrons in two different dots , as the coulomb repulsion energy contributes to the energy in the initial state .",
    "for this reason the two electrons are coherently transported across the chain together and processes leading to alternative final states are forbidden by energy conservation .",
    "let s solve the dynamical problem by starting from hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "a master equation approach for the density matrix @xmath28 describing the total system composed by @xmath7 double quantum dot has been adopted .",
    "the master equation @xcite @xmath29-\\gamma[\\rho(t)-diag(\\rho(t))]\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the pure dephasing rate , assumed to act equally on all coherences , has been solved numerically .    in figure [ nhq ]",
    "the solutions of the master equation ( [ me ] ) are shown for different values of the parameter @xmath30 and for different values of the number @xmath7 of double quantum dots composing the chain .",
    "starting from the initial condition in which all the three electrons are initialized in the first double quantum dot , we plot the element @xmath31 of the density matrix representing the probability of finding the three electrons at the tail of the chain in the double quantum dot @xmath7 .",

    "@xcite ) and by considering a chain of @xmath34 double quantum dots , the optimum value for @xmath24 is @xmath24=@xmath40$]= 6.01 ns with @xmath37= 0.94 .",
    "the total transfer time is slightly longer than @xmath24 due to duration of the vanishing gaussian tail of the broader pulses applied to the intermediate double quantum dots .",
    "another source of infidelity in the ctap is the presence of miscalibration in the control signals @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 with respect the ideal series of gaussian pulses . in appendix [ app :",
    "miscalibration ] , the effects on the interaction hamiltonian @xmath44 of an unwanted deviation in the amplitude or in the peak time of the control signals from the ideal gaussian pulses are investigated .",
    "the ctap is not the unique method which can be exploited to perform the transmission of quantum states between two remote qubits connected via a double quantum dot chain .",
    "a different approach is based on successive swap operations where the swap gate exchanges quantum states of two adjacent qubits , moving the quantum state of the head qubit towards the tail one in successive steps .",
    "the comparison between transfer performances of the two approaches is presented in appendix [ app : ctapvsswap ] .",
    "a quantum channel made by a chain of three double quantum dots is here examined in more detail . in this quantum channel the matrix form of the interaction part of the hamiltonian model",
    "is here reported : @xmath45 with state ordering @xmath46 and @xmath47 stand respectively for the state of the pair of electrons in the same quantum dot and the state of the single electron in the other .",
    "the indices @xmath48 refer to the double quantum dot composing the quantum channel .",
    "the eigenvalues of the triple quantum dot system with pulse sequence defined by eq.([eq : sequence ] ) as a function of @xmath49 with @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath26 are reported in figure [ fig : eigenval - t ] .",
    "note that there are three degenerate states at zero energy during the entire pulse sequence , by granting the adiabatic passage to take place .",
    "when the eigenvalues are degenerate , adiabaticity ensures that the system stays within the eigenspaces of the initial eigenvalue .",
    "contrarily from the non - degenerate case , the system remains in the same eigenstate when the hamiltonian varies .",
    "the three degenerate eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ h3 ] ) in correspondence to zero energy are : @xmath52\\nonumber\\\\     a complete discussion of adiabatic evolution in degenerate subspaces can be found in @xcite .",
    "let s demonstrate that a combination of the eigenstates ( [ eigen ] ) guarantees the adiabatic tunneling .",
    "any superposition of them belongs to the same zero energy eigenspace , in particular the following superposition is considered @xmath53 that after the normalization has the following form @xmath54.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the state ( [ do ] ) is analogous to the states derived in refs.@xcite .    in the adiabatic limit",
    "the passage is from the state @xmath55 when @xmath56 and @xmath57 to @xmath58 when @xmath59 and @xmath60 by maintaining the system in ( [ do ] ) , without population leakage into the other eigenstates and transient population in states @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "such time evolution is shown in figure [ 3h2d ] where the populations of the density matrix as a function of time starting from the initial condition @xmath63 is reported .     as a function of time for @xmath64 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath26 and @xmath33,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    at the end of the process as expected @xmath65 while all the others are zero , meaning that an ideal transfer takes place .",
    "this results is true irrespective of the number of double quantum dot composing the chain , the central double quantum dot is always not occupied through the transit .",
    "the adiabatic tunneling with dephasing is analyzed by solving the master equation ( [ me ] ) numerically .",

    "moreover the dependence of the tunneling rates @xmath21 on the coherent tunneling is calculated .",
    "it is governed by the transitions between the states of the double quantum dots composing the chain which in turn are controlled through external gates . in figure [ 3hw ] a collection of 3d plots",
    "is reported in which the results obtained by varying @xmath21 are shown for different values of the dephasing @xmath30 .",
    "of finding the three electrons at the tail of the chain for @xmath64 as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath21 for @xmath26 .",
    "each plot illustrates a different value of the dephasing @xmath30.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure [ 3hw ] shows the condition that assures a good transfer , which is given mostly by a large value of @xmath21 .",
    "it implies that also for a large dephasing , for example @xmath70 , one can obtain an optimal transfer by choosing an @xmath21 ten times greater than in the @xmath71 case .",
    "a ctap scheme of exchange - only spin qubit quantum states in a double quantum dot chain is obtained .",
    "the scheme allows the communication between remote sites composing a quantum circuit based on three electrons spin states in double quantum dots . unlike to single electron or singlet - triplet qubit , double quantum dot exchange - only spin",
    "qubit needs the transfer of three electrons that are used to encode the logical states .",
    "the passage from the initial state to the final one occurs in the adiabatic limit by maintaining the system in the zero energy degenerate eigenspace .",
    "population leakage into the other eigenstates is absent and transient populations are observed in the three double quantum dot chain .",
    "moreover the role played by the tunneling rates and by the dephasing on the coherent tunneling is analyzed .",
    "an increase in the dephasing parameter corresponds to a worsening in the coherent tunneling that however may be improved by choosing a tunneling rate greater than in the no - dephasing case .",
    "this work is partially supported by the project qudec , italian ministry of defence .",
    "in the following , we analyse how a miscalibrated control affects the ctap , considering deviations in the amplitude and in the peak time of the gaussian pulses with respect the ideal case . the analysis methodology is the following : after selecting one of the control signals ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) the corresponding miscalibrated pulse is obtained by adding a percentage of the ideal amplitude ( peak time ) to the selected control signal .",
    "finally , equation ( [ me ] ) with the miscalibrated pulse is solved . in figures",
    "[ n3amp ] , [ n5amp ] , [ n7amp ] and [ n9amp ] we report the resulting absolute value of the difference between the probability @xmath31 for two deviations ( + 1 % and + 10% ) with respect the amplitude of the ideal gaussian pulses and the ideal one @xmath72 as a function of @xmath24 for @xmath7=3,5,7 and 9 , respectively .",
    "only one of the signals features an unideal control .     and @xmath72 as a function of @xmath24 for two different variation ( + 1% and + 10% ) on the amplitude of @xmath41 and @xmath43 for @xmath7=3.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and @xmath72 as a function of @xmath24 for two different variation ( + 1% and + 10% ) on the amplitude of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath7=5.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     with @xmath7=7.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     with @xmath7=9.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in figures [ n3time ] , [ n5time ] , [ n7time ] and [ n9time ] , the quantity @xmath73-@xmath74 is plotted as a function of @xmath24 when one of the control signals features a peak time deviating + 1% and + 10% from the ideal one for @xmath7 ranging from 3 to 9 .     and @xmath72 as a function of @xmath24 for two different variation ( + 1% and + 10% ) on the peak time of @xmath41 and @xmath43 for @xmath7=3.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and @xmath72 as a function of @xmath24 for two different variation ( + 1% and + 10% ) on the peak time of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath7=5.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     with @xmath7=7.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     with @xmath7=9.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    such results highlight that the ctap is more sensitive to peak time variations of the gaussian pulses whereas it better tolerates a miscalibration on the amplitude of the control signals .",
    "in the following a comparison between the ctap and an alternative method to transfer the quantum state of a qubit to a remote one is presented . the alternative method considered here",
    "consists to connect two remote qubits with a chain of qubits and to apply successive swap operations ( the swap exchanges quantum states of two adjacent qubits ) to move the quantum state of the head qubit towards the tail qubit .",
    "the sequence of effective exchange interactions to perform the swap operation between two exchange - only spin - qubits is presented in @xcite with a total sequence time @xmath75=11.254 [ @xmath76/@xmath77 . in the case of successive swaps ,",
    "the chain of @xmath7 double qds is arranged as highlighted in figure [ fig : ctapvsswapchain]a with a chain transfer time @xmath78 with @xmath21 the maximum tunnelling rate between double qds and @xmath79 the singlet - triplet energy splitting in the double occupied qds .",
    "the comparison between the transfer time of ctap @xmath24 and the corresponding one for successive swaps @xmath80 is shown in figure [ fig : ctapvsswapchain]b as a function of number @xmath7 of double qds for three different values of the maximum tunnelling rate and with a fixed @xmath79= 500 @xmath81 .",
    "the transfer times increase as @xmath7 grows for both the approaches , with a linear behaviour for the successive swaps and a sub - linear one for the ctap .",
    "given @xmath79 , the tunnelling rate plays a fundamental role in determining which is the fastest approach to be preferred .",
    "in fact , successive swaps have to be preferred for high tunnelling rates whereas the ctap is faster for lower rates irrespectively on @xmath7 . when the tunnelling rates are closer to @xmath79=500 @xmath82ev successive swaps are faster for shorter chains whereas ctap must be preferred for farther interconnections .",
    "note that an intrinsic disadvantage of the approach with successive swaps is the mandatory initial filling of the qds with electrons which is not required in the case of ctap ( see figure [ fig1 ] )",
