    "it is the quantification of this sort of contribution of the morphology to the behaviour of a system that is in the focus of this work .",
    "the difference to previous literature by @xcite and @xcite , who investigated morphological computational with respect to either the actuation ( paul ) or the sensors ( lundh ) only , is that we will measure morphological computation of embodied agents acting in the sensori - motor loop , including both , sensors and actuators .    to understand which aspects",
    "a measure must cover and which it should omit , this paragraph will discuss two different artificial systems which show morphological computation . to most vivid example in this context is the passive dynamic walker by @xcite .",
    "in this example , a two - legged walking machine preforms a naturally appealing walking behaviour , without any need of control , as a result of a well - chosen morphology and environment . there is simply no computation available , and the walking behaviour is the result of the gravity , the slope of the ground and the specifics of the mechanical construction ( weight & length of the body parts , deviation of the joints , etc . ) . if any parameter of the mechanics ( morphology ) or the slope ( environment ) are changed , the walking behaviour will not persist .",
    "hence , we will only investigate morphological computation as an effect that emerges from the interaction of the control system , the body and the environment , also known as the sensori - motor loop ( see next section ) .",
    "the passive dynamic walker is , in this context , understood as an embodied agent without actuation .",
    "the behaviour of such a system is also discussed in the context of _ natural dynamics _",
    "@xcite .",
    "one may argue that the passive dynamic walker is a purely mechanical system , and that speaking of morphological computation is an overstatement in this case .",
    "this is a valid point of view , as purely mechanical system do not perform calculations as we intuitively understand the term .",
    "nevertheless , we claim that it is not an overstatement in the case of the passive dynamic walker , as this system was explicitly built to simulate the morphological computation that is present in the human walking behaviour . for this purpose",
    ", a mechanical system was constructed that reflects the morphological properties of the lower half of a human body as far as it is required to understand and model the principles involved in human walking .",
    "therefore , the passive dynamic walker is allegoric for morphological computation present in the locomotion of humans .",
    "a second impressive example for morphological computation is bigdog @xcite .",
    "this robot is a four - legged walking machine , which is built as a companion for humans operating in the field .",
    "the outstanding feature , with respect to this paper , is its morphological design . instead of classical electric motors , bigdog has hydraulic actuators , which enable it to handle situations in which other walking machines would fail and even suffer severe damage .",
    "most impressive is the video , which shows how bigdog handles a very slippery ground @xcite . watching the video , it seems impossible to program such a balancing behaviour for an arbitrarily slippery ground . that bigdog is nevertheless able to cope with it ,",
    "is also the result of the hydraulic actuators and the well - chosen morphological design in general , which are both nicely documented in the video clip  @xcite .",
    "the next step is to analyse , what both examples have in common , and in which aspects the two applications differ .",
    "the first obvious difference is the amount of available computation .",
    "morphological computation is most often associated with low computational power that leads to sophisticated behaviours ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this intuitive understanding is well - reflected in the case of bigdog , as the on - board computation accounts for only a fraction of bigdog s ability to cope with a slippery ground .",
    "this intuitive understanding is not well - reflected in the case of the passive dynamic walker , as there is no computation available at all .",
    "therefore , measuring morphological computation in relation to the computational complexity of the controller does not seem reasonable , as the amount of computation used to generate the action does influence the amount of computation conducted by the morphology .",
    "there is something that both examples have in common , and which is well - suited for a measure of morphological computation . in both cases , there is an observed ( coordinated ) behaviour of the system that is not assigned to any control . in the case of the passive dynamic walker , this is obviously the case . in the case of bigdog",
    ", it was stated above , that the behaviour of the robot on slippery ground is not fully assigned to the control , but also assigned to the design of the robot , and especially its hydraulic actuation .",
    "therefore , a quantification should capture how much of the behaviour is assigned to the morphology and environment , and _ not _ to the controller .",
    "let us make this point more clear .",
    "we are interested in the contribution of the morphology and environment to the overall behaviour of a system .",
    "this is _ not _ well - measured in terms of controller complexity .",
    "this is also the reason why we believe that bigdog is a good example for morphological computation , although its control architecture is not known .",
    "this work is organised in the following way . the next section ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sml ] ) describes the sensori - motor loop and its representation as a causal graph , and thereby , presents the conceptual foundation that is required for the remainder of this work . in the third section ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : measuring morphological computation ] ) we will then derive the different measures for morphological computation .",
    "the section begins with a summary of the intuitive understanding of morphological computation , which is then followed by a discussion of two concepts to measure it .",
    "the section ends with relating them to the information bottleneck method by @xcite .",
    "two experiments to validate and analyse the derived measures are conducted in the fourth section ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : experiments ] ) . the fifth section",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) discusses the results and the final section ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] ) concludes this work .",
    "all calculations are carried out in the appendix .",
    "the results and derived measures are available as mathematica 8 notebook file @xcite in the electronic supplementary information to this publication .",
    "to derive a quantification of morphological computation of an embodied system , it requires a formal model of the sensori - motor loop .",
    "this will be briefly summarised in the following paragraph ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : sml concept ] ) .",
    "a cognitive system consists of a brain or controller , which sends signals to the system s actuators .",
    "the actuators affect the system s environment .",
    "we prefer the notion of the system s _ umwelt _",
    "@xcite , which is the part of the system s environment that can be affected by the system , and which itself affects the system .",
    "the state of the actuators and the _ umwelt _ are not directly accessible to the cognitive system , but the loop is closed as information about both , the _ umwelt _ and the actuators are provided to the controller by the system s sensors .",
    "in addition to this general concept , which is widely used in the embodied artificial intelligence community ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we introduce the notion of _ world _ to the sensori - motor loop , and by that we mean the system s morphology and the system s _",
    "umwelt_. we can now distinguish between the intrinsic and extrinsic perspective in this context .",
    "the world is everything that is extrinsic from the perspective of the cognitive system , whereas the controller , sensor and actuator signals are intrinsic to the system .",
    "the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic is also captured in the representation of the sensori - motor loop as a causal or bayesian graph ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sml full causal ] ) . the random variables @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 refer to the controller , actuator signals , world and sensor signals , and the directed edges reflect causal dependencies between the random variables ( see @xcite ) .",
    "everything that is extrinsic is captured in the variable @xmath2 , whereas @xmath3 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 are intrinsic to the system .",
    "the random variables @xmath3 and @xmath1 are not to be mistaken with the sensors and actuators .",
    "the variable @xmath3 is the output of the sensors , which is available to the controller or brain , the action @xmath1 is the input that the actuators take .",
    "consider an artificial robotic system as an example .",
    "then the sensor state @xmath4 could be the pixel matrix delivered by some camera sensor and the action @xmath5 could be a numerical value that is taken by some motor controller to be converted in currents to drive a motor .    throughout this work",
    ", we use capital letter ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ,  ) to denote random variables , non - capital letter ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ,  ) to denote a specific value that a random variable can take , and calligraphic letters ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ,  ) to denote the alphabet for the random variables .",
    "this means that @xmath12 is the specific value that the random variable @xmath6 can take a time @xmath13 , and it is from the set @xmath14 .",
    "greek letters refer to generative kernels , i.e.  kernels which describe an actual underlying mechanism or a causal relation between two random variables . in the causal graphs throughout this paper ,",
    "these kernels are represented by direct connections between the corresponding nodes .",
    "this notation is used to distinguish generative kernels from others , such as the conditional probability of @xmath15 given that @xmath16 was previously seen , denoted by @xmath17 , which can be calculated or sampled , but which does not reflect a direct causal relation between the two random variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sml full causal ] ) .",
    "we abbreviate the random variables for better comprehension in the remainder of this work , as all measures consider random variables of consecutive time indices .",
    "therefore , we use the following notation .",
    "random variables without any time index refer to time index @xmath20 and hyphened variables to time index @xmath21 .",
    "the two variables @xmath22 refer to @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we have now defined the conceptual framework in which we will derive the measures for morphological computation .",
    "this is done in the next section , which starts with an overview .",
    "we will derive the measures for morphological computation in four steps ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : outline ] ) :    1 .",
    "descriptive definition of morphological computation .",
    "framing of two concepts which follow from step 1 .",
    "formal definition of the two concepts given in step 2 .",
    "intrinsic adaptations of the definitions given in step 3 .",
    "the fourth step is required because the two definitions given in the third step require information about the world state @xmath2 , which is generally not available .",
    "this will be discussed in detail later in this section .",
    "we understand morphological computation as the contribution of the morphology and environment to the overall behaviour of an embodied system .",
    "this implies that morphological computation must be studied in the sensori - motor loop , as it is the result of the interaction of the controller , morphology and environment .",
    "measuring morphological computation means that an observer has recorded the relevant data of an embodied agent s behaviour of interest and post - hoc asks the question how much morphological computation was present in the recoded sequence .",
    "measuring morphological computation does not mean to capture the complexity or the quality of a behaviour .",
    "these are aspects of the behaviour of cognitive systems , which are not handled by our measures .      in the following ,",
    "we assume that an embodied agent is well - captured by the sensori - motor loop as it was presented in the previous section ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sml ] ) .",
    "explicitly , we will use the term world in the way it was defined above , as the system s morphology and _",
    "umwelt_.    generally speaking , morphological computation is the effect of the current world state @xmath2 on the next world state @xmath25 , which is not assignable to the action @xmath1 .",
    "given the sensori - motor loop as we have defined it above ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sml ] ) , this can not be measured in isolation , as there is a path from @xmath2 to @xmath25 which goes through the agent .",
    "hence , we need to measure the effect of the action @xmath1 on the next world state @xmath25 so that we are able to deduce the effect of @xmath2 on @xmath25 that does not include the pathway over @xmath1 .",
    "this has two implications .",
    "first , the resulting value of such a measure is not an absolute value per se .",
    "in fact , it can only be measured as the relation of the two effects @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "second , there are two ways of comparing the effects .",
    "the first method of measuring morphological computation assumes that the next world state @xmath25 is only determined by the current world state @xmath2 , which is equivalent to assuming maximal morphological computation .",
    "any measured effect of the action @xmath1 on the next world state @xmath25 displays itself in a reduction of the resulting measurement .",
    "this is summarised in the following concept :    given a behaviour of interest of an embodied system , the amount of morphological computation is inversely proportional to the contribution of the actions of the system to the overall behaviour .",
    "this concept relates to control - dependent punishments discussed in literature to achieve high morphological computation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the second method of measuring morphological computation assumes that the next world state @xmath25 is only determined by the current action @xmath1 , which is equivalent to assuming no morphological computation .",
    "any measured effect of the current world state @xmath2 on the next world state @xmath25 displays itself in an increase of the resulting measurement .",
    "this is summarised in the following concept :    given a behaviour of interest of an embodied system , the amount of morphological computation is proportional to the contribution of the world to the overall behaviour .      the next step is to formalise the two concepts presented above . the causal diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sml full causal ] ) shows that the world kernel @xmath28 captures the influence of @xmath2 and @xmath1 on @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , it is the basis for our further considerations .",
    "if the action @xmath1 has no effect on the next world state @xmath25 , then the world kernel reduces to @xmath29 and we would state that the system shows maximal morphological computation .",
    "analogously , if the world state @xmath2 has no influence on the next world state @xmath25 , i.e.  @xmath30 , we would state that the system shows no morphological computation .",
    "measuring the differences of the world kernel to the two conditional probability distributions @xmath31 and @xmath32 leads us to the formalisations of the two concepts discussed above .",
    "the kullback - leibler divergence measures the differences of two probability distributions @xcite and applying it to our scenario gives us the definitions for the two concepts .",
    "their formalisations are given below , such that the value zero refers to no morphological computation and one refers to maximal morphological computation .    [ def : mc_a ] let the random variables @xmath33 denote the action , the current and the next world state of an embodied agent , which is described by the causal diagram shown in figure  [ fig : sml full causal ] .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the kullback - leibler divergence used in the first measure @xmath36 can also be rewritten as the conditional mutual information @xmath37 , which is related to the concept of empowerment  @xcite .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath38 and denotes how empowered an embodied agent is in a specific state of the environment .",
    "morphological computation is correlated with a low influence the influence of the action @xmath1 on the next world state @xmath25 , whereas empowerment requires the maximisation of the influence of the action on the next world state .",
    "maximising morphological computation therefore minimises the empowerment and vice versa .",
    "one may speculate that both concepts could be used as balancing forces to find the optimal amount of control for an embodied system .",
    "both definitions given above require full access to the world states @xmath2 and @xmath25 .",
    "this is undesired for two reasons .",
    "first , it limits the applicability of the measure to systems of low complexity which live in the domain of simple grid - world environments .",
    "this contradicts our interest in presenting measures that can be used to analyse natural or non - trivial artificial cognitive systems .",
    "second , we believe that the measures derived here may model an intrinsic driving force in the context of guided self - organisation of embodied systems . hence , we require that any measure must operate on intrinsically available information only .",
    "the resulting intrinsic measures are presented below , in the order of the concepts they relate to .",
    "the next sections lists the four measures without discussing them in detail .",
    "they are evaluated and discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "the first measure that operates on intrinsic information only is the canonical adaptation of the first definition to the intrinsic perspective .",
    "it must be mentioned here , that the sensor states @xmath3 and @xmath39 are understood as the intrinsically available information about the external world .",

    "is based on measuring the causal information flow of the sensor and action states @xmath44 on the next sensor state @xmath39 . to simplify the argumentation",
    ", we first consider a reactive system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sml reactive causal ] ) .",
    "the measure will then also be presented and discussed for non - reactive systems , as both cases result in different measures . the idea for this measure",
    "is captured in the figure  [ fig : causal idea ] .",
    "please keep in mind , that the sensor states @xmath3 and @xmath39 are here understood as internally available information about the system s _ umwelt_. the causal information flow from @xmath3 to @xmath39 , denoted by @xmath45 , includes the information that flows from @xmath3 to @xmath39 over all pathways .",

    "fig : causal idea s , s,a ] ) .    according to the general theory @xcite , we talk about identifiable causal effects if they are computable from observational data .",
    "we stated earlier , that we are interested in intrinsic measures .",
    "hence , we require that the causal effects are identifiable from observational data that are intrinsically available to the agent .",
    "we refer to this type of identifiability as _ intrinsically identifiable_. in our previous work @xcite , we showed that the causal effects of @xmath3 on @xmath39 and of @xmath1 on @xmath39 are intrinsically identifiable by the following conditional probability distributions : @xmath48 these distributions need to be explained .",

    "the next step in this work is to evaluate how these different measure behave , when they are applied to experiments .",

    "this section applies the morphological computation measures to two different experiments .",
    "the first experiment is a simplified parameterisable model of the one - step sensori - motor loop for reactive systems ( see fig .  [",

    "the model is defined by the four transition maps @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . for each map ,",
    "the indices refer to its parameters .",
    "hence , the entire model is parameterised by five parameters , of which two are kept constant in the experiments below .",
    "the second experiment is designed as a minimal physical system , that allows a transition between the dynamic walker @xcite and a classically controlled humanoid .",
    "both experiments use reactive systems for the reason of simplicity only .",
    "this does not mean that all measures are limited to reactive systems . in particular , the two concepts @xmath66 and @xmath36 and the intrinsic adaptations @xmath71 , @xmath43 , @xmath72 and @xmath73make no assumptions on the type of control .",
    "only @xmath74 , which is used in the following experiments , explicitly requires a reactive control .      in the introduction to this paper , it was stated that the measures presented in this work should be applicable to biological systems . in the previous section ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : measuring morphological computation ] ) , it was stated that the measures should not operate on the world state @xmath2 , also because it is not accessible for any example other then simple toy worlds .",
    "this section now evaluates the two concepts and four measures based on such a simple toy world example .",
    "this might appear as a contradiction to the previous statements , and therefore , the application of the measures to this model needs a further explanation .    in order to understand how the measures differ and in which aspects they are alike",
    ", it is best to analyse them under a fully controllable setting . using real robots only allows to fully control a very limited set of parameters of the entire system , namely the parameters of the policy and partially those of the embodiment .",
    "this improves only slightly in simulated robotics , depending on the chosen implementation .",
    "these uncontrollable or hidden parameters require robustness of the applied methods , and are one of the main arguments for favouring virtual or real robots over grid world environments .",
    "the goal of this section is different . here , we want to validate the measures by controlling the influence of the world on itself in addition to controlling the systems parameters .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to choose an experiment which allows us to fully control every aspect of the sensori - motor loop , explicitly including the world transition kernel @xmath75 . the next section will then validate the measures in a more realistic experiment .        the minimalistic model discussed in this section is shown in figure  [ fig : binary model ] and is defined by the following set of equations : +    @xmath76    @xmath77    where all random variables are from the same binary alphabet , i.e.  @xmath78 .",
    "the model is parametrisable by the variables @xmath79 , which control how deterministic the kernels are .",
    "if we consider the policy @xmath69 which is controlled by the parameter @xmath80 , then we see from equation  [ eq : binary policy ] that @xmath81 results in @xmath82 for all @xmath83 .",
    "the policy is completely random , because both actions @xmath84 and @xmath85 occur with equal probability , independent of the current sensor value @xmath86 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we set @xmath87 , then the policy changes to a dirac measure on the sensor and actuator states , i.e. @xmath88 , where @xmath89 if @xmath90 and zero otherwise .",
    "the parameter @xmath80 allows a linear transition between these two cases .    for simplicity ,",
    "but without loss of generality , the following two assumptions are made .",
    "first , it is assumed that all world states @xmath91 occur with equal probability , i.e. @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , we assume a deterministic sensor , i.e.  @xmath93 , which means that the sensor is a copy of the world state",
    ". the first assumption does not violate the generality , because it only assures that the world state itself does not already encode some structure , which is propagated through the sensori - motor loop .",
    "second , in a reactive system , as it is shown in figure  [ fig : binary model ] , the sensor state @xmath3 and @xmath1 could be reduced to a common state , with a new generative kernel @xmath94 .",
    "hence , keeping one of the two kernels deterministic and varying the other in the experiments below , does not effect the generalisation properties of this model .",
    "this leaves three open parameters @xmath95 , and @xmath80 , against which the morphological computation measures are validated ( see figures  [ fig : binary model plots mc mc ] , [ fig : binary model plots mc1 mc2 ] , and [ fig : binary model plots mc1 mc2 ] ) .    to be able to understand if the plots validate the measures , it is necessary to understand how the parameters affect the morphological computation in this model . to simplify the argumentation , it is first assumed that the policy is completely random ( @xmath81 ) , and hence , the action @xmath1 is independent of the previous world state @xmath2 ( this assumption is dropped below ) .",
    "what follows is that the world transition kernel @xmath75 ( see eq .",

    "the discussion of the results in the following paragraphs refers to these two figures and follows the ordering of the transient plots in figure  [ fig : rotator transients ] .",
    "all results were obtained by sampling the world model @xmath57 , policy @xmath58 and sensor distribution @xmath124 from the data stream of 5000 behaviour updates ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : simulation ] ) .",
    "the sampling was performed according to @xcite ( it is additionally also briefly described in section  [ app : sampling ] of the appendix ) .",

[ cols=\"^,<,^,<,^,<,^,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    the other two configurations show that a noisy controller output is filtered by the inertia of the pendulum , resulting in an angular velocity approximating the target velocity .",
    "the amount of noise @xmath141 increases the measured morphological computation as well as the higher threshold value @xmath139 .",
    "both results are consistent with our expectations .",
    "@xcite state that _ one problem with the concept of morphological computation is that while intuitively plausible , it has defied serious quantification efforts_. from the experiments presented in the previous section we can now understand where this problem rises from . in the context of a deterministic world , a deterministic embodiment , and a deterministic reactive policy",
    "one can not distinguish between the effect of the world @xmath2 and the effect of the action @xmath1 on the next world state @xmath25 as the action @xmath1 is given by a deterministic function of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the two states can be subsumed to a single state , which results in the obtained difference of the measures in the two concepts ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : mca vs mcw ] ) . we will study this with respect to a _ gedankenexperiment _ by @xcite . in his book",
    ", braitenberg discusses different vehicles , which show different behaviours due to a very simple sensor - motor coupling .",
    "the vehicle 3 is of such kind .",
    "it has two        sensors that can detect light sources and two actuators with which the system can move and steer .",
    "the sensors and motors are cross - coupled ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bv 3 ] ) . depending on the polarity of the couplings ,",
    "the vehicle is either attracted or repelled from a light source . for this experiment",
    ", the two measures result in @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "which one is considered to be correct depends on how the policy is separated from the body .",
    "one may argue , that the coupling and the coupling strength defines the policy . in this case",
    ", one has to conclude that there is low morphological computation , as the next world state is mostly determined by the policy .",
    "this favors the measure @xmath66 .",
    "one may also argue that the couplings between the sensors and actuators are of such simplicity , that they can be considered as part of the body , as the sensor signals directly feed to the actuators . in this case , the state of the system is fully determined by the current sensor state , and hence , the world state .",
    "this is in favor of the first measure @xmath36 .",
    "it seems that both concepts capture important aspects of morphological computation , but that a final answer can not yet be given here , as the discussion about the braitenberg vehicle 3 shows .",
    "another important point must be discussed here .",
    "all presented quantifications measure the influence of the world state @xmath2 on the next world state @xmath25 in one way or the other ( best seen in fig .  [ fig : m2 prime concept ] ) .",
    "one may argue , that measuring morphological computation requires to take the control system into account , as an open - loop control system should show more morphological computation compared to a closed - loop control system , because the morphology becomes more relevant .",
    "how closed - loop and open - loop systems relate , was first investigated by @xcite , who measured how much information a control system acquires from the environment .",
    "that this complementary concept does not well - capture morphological computation is shown by the following example . a manufacturing robot working in an industrial assembly line",
    "is not associated with high morphological computation , because it is especially constructed and programmed to compensate for any uncontrolled effects resulting from the morphology .",
    "the trajectory of the tool is preprogrammed to the extend that any human entering its working space during operation is risking serious injuries .",
    "this is because this type of robots are not equipped with sophisticated sensors and mainly controlled in an open - loop paradigm .",
    "morphological computation is the information that the _ environment _ processes as opposed to the information that the _ control system _ acquires @xcite or processes from the environment .",
    "we previously discussed the connection of morphological computation to the information bottleneck method .",
    "here we discussed the connection open- and closed - loop control to our measures .",
    "both are dealing with the mutual information of the current world state @xmath2 and the current action @xmath1 in different ways . investigating the connection between the information bottleneck method , touchette and lloyd s approach and morphological computation seems to be a very promising approach to generate new insights about the sensori - motor loop .",
    "unfortunately , it is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "this work began with an introduction of morphological computation in the context of embodied artificial intelligence .",
    "it was concluded , that the complexity of the controller or brain should not be the primary ingredient for a measure of morphological computation .",
    "instead , the influence of the action of an agent and the influence of the last world state need to be compared .",
    "two concepts to measure morphological computation were then discussed and formalised , from which several intrinsic adaptations were derived .",
    "the different measures were evaluated in two experiments , which showed the conceptual difficultly in measuring morphological computation . for any fully deterministic reactive system ,",
    "the influence of the action and the influence of the world are not easily separated , which leads to different results for the two concepts . as",
    "this only occurs in this very special case , i.e.  when no noise is present in the entire loop , we propose to use the different results as an indication that the observed behaviour may be due to such a deterministic reactive system .    from the derivation of the concepts it is clear that the world states @xmath2 and @xmath25 may not only include an individual s morphology and _ umwelt _ but also those of other agents . hence",
    ", our measures also apply to quantify collective behaviours , as e.g.  stigmergy , flocking , etc .",
    "discussing this is beyond the scope of this work but subject to future research .",
    "two concluding remarks will close this work .",
    "first , the presented concepts each point to important aspects of morphological computation , but are not the final answer .",
    "a final measure will have to combine both concepts into one .",
    "how this can be done is open to future work .",
    "second , although a definite answer is not yet given , the intrinsic adaptations are good candidates for self - organisation principles .",
    "an embodied system should maximise its morphological computation in order to minimise its computational requirements .",
    "this may have implications for practical applications in the field of robotics , as the amount of on - board computation , and therefore , load and energy requirements could be reduced . in first and ongoing experiments",
    "we apply the intrinsic measures to the learning of locomotion for a six - legged walking machine in the context of reinforcement learning .",
    "the travelled distance is multiplied with the normalised intrinsic measures to give the overall reward . here",
    ", practical advantages of the measures in the second concept seem to be that they start with zero , which means that there is a higher pressure to exploit the morphology , and that they are more sensitive , which was already seen in the rotator experiment presented above .",
    "concluding we state , that although not finally answered , the proposed measures already give powerful tools to measure and exploit morphological computation in the context of embodied intelligence .",
    "this works was partly funded by the dfg priority program 1527 , autonomous learning .",
    "the causal information flows used in the section  [ sec : measuring morphological computation ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : causal idea s , s ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : causal idea a , s ] ) , are derived by the means of a mutual information measure .",
