    "the success of the relativistic hydrodynamics in describing the rhic data @xcite suggests that the hot and dense matter produced at rhic behaves like an almost perfect fluid @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss how the boost - invariant and cylindrically asymmetric relativistic hydrodynamic equations for baryon - free perfect fluid may be very conveniently reduced to only two coupled partial differential equations .",
    "our presentation is based on the recent investigations published in refs .",
    "we argue that the effects of the cross - over phase transition may be included by the use of the temperature dependent sound velocity @xmath0 . as long as the function @xmath0 satisfies the stability condition against the shock formation",
    ", the resulting equations may be solved with the help of standard numerical methods and used to describe the expansion of matter produced in the central region of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , such as studied in the present rhic or future lhc experiments .",
    "the presented formalism is a direct generalization of the approach introduced by baym , friman , blaizot , soyeur , and czyz @xcite where the boost - invariant and cylindrically symmetric systems were considered , and the numerical calculations were performed only for the case of the constant sound velocity .",
    "the relativistic hydrodynamic equations of the perfect fluid follow from the energy - momentum conservation law and the assumption of the local thermal equilibrium . for baryon - free matter",
    "they have the following form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the temperature , @xmath3 is the entropy density , and @xmath4 is the four - velocity of the fluid . for boost - invariant systems eqs .",

    "the center of the first nucleus in the transverse plane is placed at @xmath37 , and of the second nucleus at @xmath38 .",
    "in such a case we require that the magnitude of the flow vanishes at @xmath39 .",
    "this condition is fulfilled naturally by the ansatz    [ adefwe ] @xmath40    we supplement the ansatz ( [ adefwe ] ) by the definition of the function @xmath27 for the negative arguments , see fig . [",

    "the use of the polar coordinates in the transverse plane requires also that all functions at @xmath44 and @xmath45 are equal : @xmath46 .",
    "in the following we assume that the hydrodynamic evolution starts at a typical time @xmath47 fm .",
    "we assume also that the initial temperature profile is connected with the number of participating nucleons @xmath48 the idea to use eq .",
    "( [ tt0 ] ) follows from the assumption that the initially produced entropy density @xmath49 is proportional to the number of the nucleons participating in the collision at the position @xmath50 .",
    "since the considered systems are initially very hot ( with the temperature exceeding the critical temperature @xmath51 ) , they may be considered as systems of massless particles , where the entropy density is proportional to the third power of the temperature . in this way we arrive at eq .",

    "in this section we give an example of our results describing the collisions with the impact parameter @xmath58 = 7.6 fm , typical for centrality class @xmath59 @xcite . in this case the initial central temperature @xmath60 equals 2.5 @xmath51 , where @xmath51 is the critical temperature , @xmath61 .",

    "one can observe that during the whole considered evolution time , 1 fm @xmath65 16 fm , the @xmath63-extension of the system remains larger than the @xmath36-extension .",
    "however , the relative magnitude of this effect decreases with time , indicating that the cylindrical symmetry is gradually restored as the time increases . in this part of fig .",
    "[ fig : res1 ] one can also notice the effect of the phase transition ; initially the system cools down rather rapidly , later the cooling down is delayed and the main visible effect is the increase of the volume of the system .",
    "we note that this behavior is related to the sudden decrease of the sound velocity in the region @xmath66 .",
    "the part b ) of fig . [",
    "fig : res1 ] shows the isotherms in the @xmath67 space , again for @xmath44 ( solid lines ) and @xmath64 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the pairs of isotherms indicate different values of the temperature .",
    "they start at @xmath68 and go down to @xmath69 , with a step of @xmath70 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the solid and dashed lines cross each other .",
    "this effect means that the central ( relatively hotter ) part of the system acquires a pumpkin - like shape during the evolution of the system .",
    "such pumpkin - like regions , however , shrink and disappear during further expansion . in the part c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : res1 ] the profiles of the function @xmath27 are shown for @xmath62 fm and @xmath71 . for @xmath44 and @xmath64",
    "the function @xmath27 vanishes due to the symmetry reasons . in the first and third quadrant",
    "the values of @xmath11 are predominantly negative , while in the second and fourth quadrant the values of @xmath11 are positive .",
    "this behavior characterizes the direction of the flow which has the tendency to change the initial almond shape into a cylindrically symmetric shape . in the part",
    "d ) the velocity profiles are shown , again for @xmath72 = 1 , 4 , 10 , 16 fm . similarly to the previously discussed figures , the solid lines are the profiles for @xmath44 ( @xmath36-direction ) , whereas the dashed lines are the profiles for @xmath64 ( @xmath63-direction ) .",
    "one can observe that the magnitude in the @xmath36-direction is larger than the magnitude in the @xmath63-direction , which is an expected hydrodynamic behavior caused by larger pressure gradients in the @xmath36-direction .",
    "exactly this effect is responsible for the observed azimuthal asymmetry of the transverse - momentum spectra , quantified by the values of the @xmath73 coefficient .",
    "finally , in the part e ) we show the contour lines of the temperature , again for different values of time .",
    "these plots visualize the time development of the system .",
    "the arrows describe the magnitude and the direction of the flow ( for better recognition the angle @xmath11 is magnified by a factor of 3 ) .",

    "the symmetry of the problem allows us to rewrite the hydrodynamic equations as only two coupled partial differential equations , ( [ alphaeq ] ) and ( [ aeq ] ) , which automatically lead to the fulfillment of the requested boundary conditions for the velocity and the temperature at the center of the system .",
    "the effects of the phase transition are included in this scheme by the use of the temperature dependent sound velocity .",
    "the presented results of the hydrodynamic calculations , supplemented with the appropriate freeze - out model ( , the single - freeze - out model of refs .",
    "@xcite ) , may be used to calculate different physical observables . to achieve this task , in the closest future",
