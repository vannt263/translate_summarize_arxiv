    "the recent interest in examining the off - shell behavior of @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing @xcite and @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing @xcite is based on the observation of goldman , henderson and thomas ( ght ) @xcite that the meson mixing previously used in the calculation of the nucleon - nucleon ( n - n ) charge - symmetry - violating ( csv ) potential @xcite may not be correct . in particular ,",
    "the value of @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing found experimentally in the time - like region @xmath6 may not apply in the space - like region , from which the csv potential is generated .",
    "subsequently , other authors have discussed this issue for @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing by using different effective models @xcite , and also find appreciable @xmath0 dependence of the mixing amplitude . with the advent of qcd sum rules @xcite and their phenomenological success in describing hadronic properties @xcite ,",
    "it is natural to apply this technique to meson - mixing , particularly since the method is closer to qcd than other models that have been used .    in the pioneering work of shifman , vainshtein and zakharov ( svz ) @xcite , the  on shell \"",
    "@xmath4-@xmath5 mixing was used as an illustration of the power of qcd sum rules .",
    "however , in their paper some fine points remain elusive and there is no discussion of the  off - shell \" behavior of meson - mixing .",
    "these details were re - examined by hatsuda , henley , meissner and krein ( hhmk ) @xcite , who used both borel and finite - energy sum rules , together with dispersion relations to determine the momentum - dependence of @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing .",
    "they found a rapid @xmath0 variation of the mixing parameter @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we shall follow the spirit of hhmk in applying it to @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing . by performing the borel analysis",
    ", we can extract @xmath3 as a function of the csv parameters , and we can also study how the qcd condensates affect the mixing function @xmath3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section i , we establish notations and definitions .",
    "the calculations are described in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we relate our results to those of ght @xcite and piekarewicz - williams ( pw ) @xcite .",
    "finally , in section v , conclusions and a summary are presented .",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing function @xmath3 is defined by the mixed correlator of @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are eigenstates of an isosymmetric strong - interaction hamiltonian .",
    "we can express the physical @xmath1-@xmath2 fields , which are eigenstates of the full strong interaction hamiltonian , in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , by introducing the mixing matrix @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a  mixing angle \" . by saturating the @xmath12 with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 poles and using a dispersion relation for @xmath13",
    ", we can write @xmath14 where the mixing function is related to the mixing angle @xmath11 as @xmath15 q^2 + \\left[m^2_\\eta\\epsilon ( m^2_\\pi)-m^2_\\pi\\epsilon(m^2_\\eta)\\right]\\;.\\ ] ]    since the @xmath11  mixing angle \" may be a function of @xmath0 , the value of @xmath16 may be different from that of @xmath17 ; in this way the mixing function @xmath3 develops a linear dependence on @xmath0 .    on the other hand , in order to study the meson properties from the quark - gluon degrees of freedom without being plagued by the problem of wave functions ,",
    "we need to introduce interpolating quark currents for the correlation function , and the meson properties are represented by the experimentally measurable matrix elements of these quark currents . in the present case , we choose to work with the axial vector currents rather than pseudoscalar ones for a number of reasons .",
    "foremost is that , although @xmath1 and @xmath2 are pseudoscalar particles , the use of the axial vector currents gives a better convergence property @xcite .",
    "secondly , on the mass shell , the two currents are directly related . in an su(3 ) notation , we use    @xmath18    the correlator of these two currents is defined by @xmath19    using the definition of the mixing angle @xmath11 , ( eq .  ( 3 ) ) , the pcac relation for @xmath1 and @xmath2,@xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the decay constants for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the pole approximation for @xmath23 , we have :    @xmath24.\\ ] ]    because of the structure of pcac and the @xmath1-@xmath2 pole approximation , there is no @xmath25 term in @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 poles , let us also include the next resonances in the @xmath26 ; these resonances are a pair of pseudo - vector particles the @xmath27(1235 ) ( denoted by a ) and @xmath28(1170 ) ( denoted by b ) ; these resonances contribute to @xmath26 ,    @xmath29,\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 are the decay constants for a and b particles .    combining these two contributions",
    ", we can rewrite    @xmath31    where    @xmath32    these parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are unknown and will be determined from the qcd sum rules .",
    "once they are determined in terms of the csv parameters and the wilson coefficients of the ope for the quark current - current correlation function , we can substitute these numbers into the mixing function @xmath3 and discuss its momentum dependence in the region of interest .    in the case of @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing , in contrast to the case of @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing ,",
    "there is no  on shell \" value for @xmath3 , due to the large difference of @xmath1 and @xmath2 masses , @xmath37 = 412 mev @xmath38 ; this mass difference presumably comes primarily from the s - quark contribution in the @xmath2 .",
    "there is , thus , no direct experimental method to study @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing , unlike @xmath39 at the @xmath5-resonance @xcite , since @xmath1 and @xmath2 can not be formed from one photon states in @xmath40 collisions ; however , the decay of the @xmath8 to @xmath41 via the @xmath7 pole serves to set an  experimental \" mixing at the @xmath2 mass @xcite .",
    "here we shall content ourselves to use experimentally measured masses for the @xmath1(135 ) , @xmath2(547 ) , b(1235 ) and @xmath28(1170 ) particles as input parameters , and distinguish between @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 as independent variables .",
    "although we do not rely on an expansion in terms of the mass difference @xmath44 to perform the calculations as in the @xmath4-@xmath5 case , the large mass difference of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is comfortably accommodated without difficulty .",
    "one important ingredient of the qcd sum rules is the operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite for the correlation functions . in our case",
    ", we calculate the ope of @xmath45 by keeping operators up to dimension 6 . for the wilson coefficients , we work to first order in @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the fine structure constant for the strong ( electromagnetic ) interaction , and @xmath50 is the current mass of quark @xmath51 ( @xmath52 for @xmath53 quark , and @xmath54 for @xmath55 quark ) .",
    "we use the definition @xmath56 ; we do not include the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath46 but choose its value at 1 gev@xmath57 , @xmath46 ( 1 gev@xmath57 ) @xmath58 0.5 .",
    "our calculation is similar to that for the @xmath4-@xmath5 case but we are dealing with axial vector currents for pseudoscalar mesons ; thus , the reader may convince himself or herself of the signs of our results by counting the number of @xmath59 matrices in each diagram . in the following ,",
    "we shall neglect a detailed discussion of each diagram ( c.f .",
    "ref.@xcite ) and simply write down the relevant answers :    @xmath60    where @xmath61\\nonumber \\\\ c_3 & = & { 352\\over 81}\\pi\\alpha_s[<\\bar uu>^2 - < \\bar dd>^2 ] \\nonumber \\\\      &    & + { 88\\over 243}\\;\\pi\\alpha[4<\\bar uu>^2 - <",
    "\\bar dd>^2].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is helpful to note three points :    \\(1 ) for vector mesons , the conservation of the vector current leads to a @xmath62 that must be proportional to @xmath63 ; therefore @xmath64 .",
    "this is no longer true in the @xmath1-@xmath2 case , since the axial vector current is not conserved .",
    "a side benefit is that we now have two independent sum rules for @xmath45 , and we can take advantage of this property to extract information on the parameters appearing in the mixing function @xmath3    \\(2 ) if we restrict ourselves to operators up to dimension 6 and make the vacuum saturation assumption ( vsa ) for the four quark condensate @xcite , we find that the @xmath65 quark in the @xmath2 current ( eq .  ( 5 ) ) does not contribute at all .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath65 quark could only arise in the four quark condensate @xmath66 ( @xmath51 = up or down quark ) which vanishes under the vsa .",
    "\\(3 ) taking the difference of the sum rules for @xmath67 and @xmath68 we see that the coefficient @xmath69 for the dimension 6 , four - quark condensate drops out .",
    "therefore the uncertainty in this coefficient due to the assumption of the vsa can be ignored .",
    "the next step is to relate these csv parameters and condensates to the phenomenological parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the rhs of @xmath70 ( our model for @xmath70 ) . in order to assure convergence , to accentuate the lower resonances and to lessen the effect of the continuum",
    ", we follow the standard practice of applying a borel transformation to @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite ,    @xmath71\\equiv\\lim_{{{{n\\to\\infty\\atop q^2\\to\\infty}\\atop{{q^2\\over n } = m^2}}\\atop { \\rm fixed}}}\\;{1\\over ( n-1)!}(q^2)^n\\left(-{d\\over dq^2 } \\right)^n\\;.\\ ] ]    in this way , we obtain a set of simultaneously linear equations for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 :    the sum rule for @xmath67 gives @xmath72 \\nonumber \\\\ &   & + \\;{\\rm higher \\ resonances } ( \\pi',\\eta')(a',b ' ) + { \\rm continuum}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and that for @xmath68 yields @xmath73 + { \\rm higher \\ resonances } ( a',b ' ) + { \\rm continuum}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    taking the difference , we get @xmath74 + { \\rm higher \\ resonances } ( \\pi',\\eta')\\;.\\ ] ] it is worthwhile to call attention to the fact that the contributions of higher resonances @xmath27(1235 ) and @xmath28(1170 ) and continuum have been completely canceled in eq . ( 16 ) .",
    "the same is true for the electromagnetic continuum , whereas higher resonances in the pseudoscalar channel , such as @xmath75(1300 ) - @xmath76(1290 ) , will survive ( in principle ) in eq .",
    "however , it will turn out that taking these resonances explicitly into account does not change the borel analysis noticeably .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing where the corresponding high resonances ( @xmath77-@xmath78 ) are important .    by taking the derivative with respect to @xmath79 on both sides of eq .",
    "( 16 ) , we obtain another sum rule :    @xmath80    with these two equations , we can solve for @xmath33 and @xmath34 :    @xmath81    finally , the mixing function is @xmath82 where @xmath83 where we assume the su(3 ) symmetry for the decay constants @xmath84 .    in fig .  1 we plot the dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath34 on @xmath85 .",
    "in the preferred region of 1.0 gev@xmath86 gev@xmath57 , the difference between @xmath33 and @xmath34 is small .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen from fig .  1 and eq .  ( 18 ) that if @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "we thus find that @xmath3 has a weak @xmath0 dependence .    in order to fix the values of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath47 and @xmath89 ,",
    "we choose a suitable borel window and average the functions @xmath90 , @xmath91 over the range of @xmath85 ( 1 gev@xmath57 @xmath58 1.5 gev@xmath57 ) . at this point",
    ", one should note that if we included the higher resonances @xmath1(1300 ) and @xmath2(1295 ) in the phenomenological side of the sum rules and left their masses as parameters , we could perform the stability analysis to obtain the  optimal \" values for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , our numerical results do not suggest such  optimal \" values are well - defined .",
    "the numerical values we obtain for these parameters are    @xmath92    all numbers have an error of about 10 - 20% , which is due to the uncertainty of the isospin symmetry violating quantities @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the coefficient @xmath95 and the fact that @xmath96 gev@xmath57 for stability .",
    "in this section , we shall compare our results with those of other authors , who use a different approach .",
    "@xmath1-@xmath2 mixing has been considered previously by maltman and goldman ( mg ) @xcite and piekarewicz ( p ) @xcite .",
    "maltman used chiral perturbation theory @xcite to calculate the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing to the one - loop order .",
    "the mixing function @xmath3 is expressed in terms of meson masses and other physical observables ; theoretical uncertainty comes from the electromagnetic mass difference of kaons . in order to verify the assumption which underlies the ght calculation .",
    "maltman and goldman @xcite also use a chiral quark model to calculate @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing and get a consistent result with chiral perturbation theory .",
    "piekarewicz @xcite used a purely hadronic model to calculate @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing , where the mixing is generated by a @xmath97 loop . in order to fix the renormalization point for the divergent",
    "integral , he chose the  on shell \" value of @xmath98 to fix the intercept of the mixing function .",
    "he also derived a ratio between the slope at the origin of the @xmath4-@xmath5 and @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing amplitudes @xmath99 which he claimed to be less model - dependent and to hold approximately for a reasonable range of @xmath0 .    in view of the lack of  on - shell \" experimental value for the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing amplitude ( the previous calculations are based on su(3 ) mass splitting @xcite of pseudoscalar mesons and a pole model analysis of the @xmath2-@xmath76 system @xcite ) , our calculation provides an independent result for the slope and intercept for the mixing function .",
    "we list the different results from the three calculations in table 1 .",
    "it is to be noticed that our slopes are three times smaller than that of chiral perturbation theory and correspondingly so is the ratio @xmath100 . because of the small slope",
    ", our mixing function only changes about 5% from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , the mixing function is practically a constant . on the other hand ,",
    "the intercept of our mixing function ( @xmath89 ) is fairly close to that obtained in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore it should be noted that both in the ght and in the pw approaches the @xmath0 variation of the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing amplitude is much smaller than the one for the @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing amplitude obtained in the same approaches @xcite .",
    "finally , our mixing function gives an  on shell \" value @xmath103 of 3800 mev@xmath57 , which is slightly smaller ( but within our estimated error ) than that of the other two approaches and the one of 4200 mev@xmath57 obtained from the csb nn force @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we use qcd sum rules to study @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing , choosing a combination of the two sum rules coming from the correlation functions of two axial vector currents .",
    "we are able to extract the leading behavior of the mixing function @xmath104 as a function of @xmath0 without the need to use four - quark condensates .",
    "we obtain @xmath105 mev@xmath57 , and a @xmath0-dependence of @xmath3 that is compatible with zero .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath4-@xmath5 mixing amplitude , which varies strongly with @xmath0 .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with those obtained from various quark and hadronic models as well as from chiral perturbation theory .",
