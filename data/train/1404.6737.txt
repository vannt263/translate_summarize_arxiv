    "vast efforts have been lately devoted to the analysis of the underwater acoustic ( uwa ) communications channel .",
    "various applications that encounter an uwa channel include underwater sensor networks that are installed at the bottom of oceans for different purposes like data collection , pollution monitoring , assisted navigation , and offshore exploration [ 1 ] .",
    "unmanned and autonomous underwater vehicles that carry sensors for natural underwater exploration are also applications that push towards studying the behavior of the uwa channel .",
    "previous works have analyzed the different characteristics of the uwa channels in terms of error rate performance and receiver design [ 2]-[6 ] . in order to obtain the fundamental performance limits of the uwa channel ,",
    "it is mandatory to characterize the statistical behavior of the additive noise and fading processes exhibited by transceivers operating in underwater environments . in [ 2 ] , the authors studied different types of noise sources that exist in the underwater nature .",
    "existence of all of these sources will lead to the standard gaussian distributed noise [ 7 ] .",
    "however , in other cases , such as communications in shallow water levels , one of these sources dominate , which leads to a different noise model . the standard gaussian noise model does not hold in dominant noise scenarios , and it was found that generalized gaussian ( gg ) distributions accurately describe the behavior of such channels . in [ 4 ] and",
    "[ 5 ] , the error rate for the channels with gg noise was evaluated .",
    "the authors also studied the impact of designing optimal receivers based on awgn channel while actually operating in awggn underwater environments .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the capacity of the awggn channel was never evaluated before .",
    "moreover , it is important to characterize the fading statistics in the underwater environment . in [ 8 ] , many experiments have been done trying to define the best representation of the uwa channel fading .",
    "the experiments were carried out by transmitting continuous wave signals in shallow water at depth of 6 to 12 meters at _ rio de janeiro _ , _ brazil_. the received signals was analyzed at different frequencies after removing the noise effect , and it was found that the @xmath1-@xmath2 distribution accurately describes the uwa channel fading statistics .    in this paper , we derive an upper bound on the achievable capacity of the uwa acoustic channel based on a gg noise model .",
    "it is shown that the uwa channel capacity is bounded by the conventional awgn channel capacity added to a constant gap that depends on the gg distribution shaping parameter @xmath0 .",
    "next , we develop an upper bound on the ergodic capacity of the uwa channel based on a generalized @xmath1-@xmath2 distribution . the proposed upper bound is generic and depends on the parameters tuple ( @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 ) , thus it described a wide range of uwa communications settings in terms of depth , frequency , and dominance of noise sources .",
    "we interpret the analytical results by revisiting the sphere - packing problem , which serves as a geometric interpretation of channel capacity .",
    "moreover , we characterize the uwa channel secrecy when the dominant noise sources at the legitimate and eavesdropper receivers are different .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section ii , the gg and the @xmath1-@xmath2 distributions will be represented . in section iii",
    ", the awggn uwa channel capacity upper bound will be derived .",
    "section iv presents an expression for the capacity upper bound with both gg noise and @xmath1-@xmath2 fading . knowing that secrecy rate in a channel with some eavesdropper depends mainly on the channel capacity for both source - destination channel and source - eavesdropper channel",
    ", we study secrecy rate when these channels have gg noise model in section v. analytical results will be shown in section vi .",
    "the paper is concluded in section vii .",
    "for the awggn channel , the received signal @xmath4 at the @xmath5 time instant results from adding the transmitted signal @xmath6 to a gg noise signal @xmath7 as follows @xmath8 it is assumed that consecutive noise samples are uncorrelated .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of a noise sample @xmath9 is given by the gg distribution [ 9 ] @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mean of the pdf which is typically equal to zero for a noise process , @xmath12 is the gamma function , @xmath13 and @xmath0 are both scale and shape parameters of the gg pdf .",
    "the variance of @xmath9 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "based on the value of @xmath0 , the gg distribution may converge to other known densities .",
    "for instance , the channel reduces to a standard awgn channel for @xmath0 = 2 .",
    "figure 1 depicts the pdf of a gg distributed random variable .",
    "it is shown that as the value of @xmath0 decreases , the pdf becomes more confined around its mean value , which means that it becomes  _ more deterministic _ \" .",
    "for @xmath0 = 0.1 , the pdf of the gg random variable is close to an impulse located at the mean value , which implies that small values of @xmath0 correspond to less uncertainity about the value of the noise sample .",
    ".,width=312 ]      for the faded awggn channel , the received signal @xmath4 at the @xmath5 time instant results from adding the transmitted signal @xmath6 mutliplied by a fading channel gain @xmath15 to a gg noise signal @xmath7 as follows @xmath16 where coherent detection is assumed at the receiver .",
    "the pdf of @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an arbitrary parameter , @xmath20{\\mathbb{e}\\{h^{\\alpha}\\}}$ ] , and @xmath21 , given that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the expectation and variance operators .     versus the gg shaping parameter @xmath0.,width=312 ]",
    "in order to calculate the capacity of the awggn channel , we start by deriving the differential entropy @xmath24 of the gg random variable @xmath9 . the differential entropy is given by @xmath25 which can be easily evaluated as @xmath26    for some message signal @xmath27 and gg distributed noise @xmath9 , the received signal @xmath28 can be represented as @xmath29 .",
    "assuming zero mean noise and message signal power @xmath30 then received power can be given by @xmath31 thus , the received signal power can be obtained by plugging the variance of the gg distribution as follows @xmath32 by definition the channel capacity is the maximum mutual information @xmath33 which is given by : @xmath34 where ( 7 ) follows from the fact that @xmath35 .",
    "following theorem 9.6.5 in [ 10 ] , the differential entropy @xmath36 is bounded by the entropy of a gaussian signal as follows @xmath37 by combining ( 4 ) , ( 7 ) , and ( 8) , the capacity of the awggn channel @xmath38 is bounded by @xmath39 where the bound is achieved only if the pdf of the input signal is chosen such that the received signal is gaussian , i.e. @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the convolution operator . taking into consideration that @xmath38 is lower bounded by @xmath42 , as the gaussian noise is a worst case ( maximum entropy ) noise [ 11]-[12 ] , the capacity of the uwa channel when dominant noise sources exist forming a gg noise process with a shaping parameter @xmath0 is lower bounded by the awgn capacity and upper bounded by the awgn with an additive constant gap of @xmath43 , for a noise variance of @xmath44 as shown in eq .",
    "figure 2 depicts the constant capacity gap @xmath45 versus the shaping parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it is obvious that this gap is always positive , and is euqal to 0 only when @xmath0 = 2 , which is the awgn scenario .",
    "thus , impulsive noise offers opportunities for improving capacity compared to awgn , and the amount of capacity improvment is dependent on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "lower values of the shaping parameter corresponds to less entropy for the noise process , and thus more capacity .",
    "this conclusions fit with the results obtained in [ 11 ] and [ 12 ] , where the authors proved that gaussian noise is a worst case additive noise , and the capacity of non - gaussian channels is bounded by the gaussian channel capacity .",
    "@xmath46      the analytical results obtained in the previous subsection can be interpreted geometrically by revisiting the sphere - packing problem . for an @xmath47-dimensional codeword @xmath27 , the received codeword @xmath48 where @xmath9 is the noise added ,",
    "the received codeword in general lies with high probability in a sphere with volume @xmath49 called the y - sphere . for a certain codeword @xmath27 , the received codeword @xmath28 will lie in the noise sphere around this codeword @xmath27 with volume @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , the maximum number of noise spheres @xmath51 that can be packed inside the y - sphere without overlapping will be the ratio between their volumes @xmath52 . in both cases of awgn and awggn noise channels ,",
    "@xmath36 have the same expression while the only difference is in the expression of the conditional differential entropy @xmath53 , which is equal to @xmath54 . by revisiting the analysis in the previous subsection",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath55 thus , for the same noise variance , the number of gg noise spheres that can be packed into the y - sphere is given by @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , for the same noise variance , awggn noise spheres have a volume that is less than the volume of the awgn noise sphere with a factor of @xmath57 , which allows packing @xmath58 more spheres in the gg channel . to sum up ,",
    "when the noise spheres are _ immersed _ under water , they get _ compressed _ with a factor of @xmath58 , allowing to pack more noise spheres in the y - sphere .",
    "a comprehensive experimental study in [ 8 ] has shown that the @xmath1-@xmath2 fading distribution fits a wide range of underwater fading scenarios .",
    "having obtained bounds on the awggn uwa channel capacity , we can conclude that the conditional capacity @xmath59 of the channel given a fading channel gain @xmath17 as @xmath60 and @xmath61 the ergodic capacity can be obtained by averaging the conditional capacity over the pdf of @xmath17 as follows @xmath62 the bounds on the ergodic capacity can be easily obtained by solving the integral @xmath63 , which corresponds to the ergodic capacity with awgn @xmath64 .",
    "this integral was calculated in [ 13 ] , and is given by eq .",

    "the condition for the existence of a secrecy rate in the awgn channel is @xmath79 , i.e. the legitimate channel average snr must be greater than that of the eavesdropper channel . for the uwa awggn , the secrecy capacity is given by eq .",

( 10 ) versus snr for different values of @xmath0 , we note that at lower values of snr the @xmath42 term will be very small while the f(@xmath0 ) term will become dominant and the difference appears here between different curves , but at larger values of snr the @xmath42 term will be very large and dominate leading to less difference between curves .",
