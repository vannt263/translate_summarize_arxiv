    "this leads to the estimate @xmath15 for the orbital angular momentum in the ground state . on the other hand , the superconducting ground state in the bcs theory",
    "is described by a modification of the free fermion ground state in an energy shell @xmath16 , outside which the system is roughly unchanged .",
    "this point of view seems to imply that only the states in the pairing energy window @xmath16 contribute to the angular momentum @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the fermi energy . since the pairing energy may be much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath20 ,",

    "recent insights based on topology and edge states in a finite geometry have lead to important new understanding in the angular momentum problem . in the standard bcs description , the number of particles @xmath12 and analogous one - body observables are not conserved quantities due to the @xmath22 symmetry breaking pairing terms .",
    "building on volovik s notion that the operator combination @xmath23 still commutes with a rotationally invariant hamiltonian with @xmath0 pairing terms , tada , nie and oshikawa expressed the ground state angular momentum in a disc geometry in terms of a spectral asymmetry index of the bogoliubov- de gennes hamiltonian.@xcite a finite spectral asymmetry index , studied by volovik@xcite in the context of @xmath11he , arises from a spectral flow taking place in the topological phase transition between a strong - pairing phase and a weak - pairing phase when the chemical potential crosses zero,@xcite see fig .",

    "however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ potential ] , deformations of the radial confining potential do not lead to finite spectral asymmetry or departures of the angular momentum from the universal value .",
    "in the present work we studied the ground state angular momentum in chiral superfluids and superconductors confined to a disc .",
    "motivated by the recent discovery that orbital angular momentum in chiral @xmath0 systems behaves dramatically differently for @xmath2 and @xmath4 , we examined several further directions . by employing spectral asymmetry arguments we showed that for @xmath2 , the result @xmath3 is robust against deformations of the confining potential , appropriate for smooth and hard - wall potentials as well as an annulus geometry .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath4 the ratio @xmath32 can be strongly tuned by an external rotationally symmetric potential .",
