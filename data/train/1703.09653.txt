    "quasar outflow , as an essential component of the quasar structure , has been routinely invoked as a primary feedback mechanism to explain the growth of super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) , evolution of the host galaxies , enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , cluster cooling flows , and the luminosity function of quasars , e.g. @xcite .",
    "these outflows often manifest themselves as blueshifted broad absorption lines ( bals ) in 20 - 40% of quasars @xcite . to assess whether bal outflows are an effective agent of quasar feedback , it is necessary to determine their average mass flow rate and associated kinetic luminosity .",
    "theoretical studies and simulations suggested that kinetic power of order of only  1% of the eddington luminosity is deemed sufficient for significant feedback effects on the host galaxy , e.g. @xcite , which now becomes the benchmark number for observational comparisons .",
    "the spatial extents of bal outflows are challenging to measure , which have been found to span several orders of magnitude ( ranging from parsec to kilo - parsec scales ) , though pc vs. kpc controversial results are sometimes reported in the literature , e.g. see the comments by @xcite .",
    "the controversy in the outflow radius directly leads to large uncertainty in the outflow enegetics , rendering it pointless to determine whether effective feedback is at work .",
    "the most direct method to pin down the outflow radius is using spatially resolved spectroscopy , especially integral field unit ( ifu ) spectroscopy , e.g. @xcite , but for high - redshift ( @xmath3 ) bal quasars , the realistic approach is deriving the galactocentric distance of the outflow ( r ) from ionization parameter ( @xmath4 $ ] ) , where the hydrogen number density @xmath5 can be determined from the absorption lines of the excited states of ions ( e.g. fe ii * , si ii * , s iv * ) . during the last decade or so , the outflow radii have been measured for a number of individual quasars using density - sensitive absorption lines from excited levels , e.g. @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that when the utilized absorption lines are broad and blended , and/or when severe saturation ( commonly ) takes place , this approach , relying on photoionization modeling and geometric assumptions , introduces nontrivial uncertainty .",
    "complementary to the conventional approaches , here we propose a method to estimate the spatial location of the outflow for a special class of bal quasars . as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , a number of quasars show a narrow ( or even spiky ) @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  emission line at the bottom of broad and close - to - black v  nv  absorption trough , indicating that the @xmath0  lyman@xmath0   line emission is leaked from the emission line region , which is otherwise virtually compleletly obscured by the bal region / outflow ( the concept of a bal region and that of a bal outflow are used interchangeably throughout the paper , because the detailed physical difference between them is subtle ; even if the difference is nontrivial , their spatial scales are expected to be of the same order of magnitude ) . with this physical picture",
    "constructed , the size of a bal region can be derived by assuming virialized line - emitting gas surrounding a super - massive black hole with known mass ( detailed in section 4 ) .",
    "in this paper , we present three @xmath6 quasars charaterizing close - to - black v  nv   absorption troughs and spiky leaked @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  emission lines , and demonstrate how our method is applied on them . as a result of a comprehensive search in the sdss - iii dr12 database ( see section 2 for details ) , these objects are among the most representative examples of this special class of bal quasars .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  2 , we describe the selection of the quasars from the sdss - iii database , and the basic properties of their spectroscopy data .",
    "the analysis of their spectra is presented in  3 , and the size and energetics of their bal outflows are measured in  4 and  5 .",
    "we further discuss the origin of these spiky lya emission lines in  6 , before a summary given in  7 . throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt a standard @xmath7cdm cosmology with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ^ -1 kms@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) , part of the third generation of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii ) , uses the dedicated 2.5-m wide - field telescope at apache point observatory near sacramento peak in southern new mexico to conduct an imaging and spectroscopic survey .",
    "this catalog is a product of the intensive visual inspection of sdss optical spectra from the twelfth data release ( dr12 ; @xcite ) undertaken by @xcite .",
    "about 10% ( 29580 ) of these quasars show bals , whose trough - by - trough properties have been measured and catalogued in the dr12q_bal table by the same group . for our purposes , the visually inspected redshift ( @xmath12 ) , the median signal - to - noise ratio over the rest - frame wavelength range 1650 - 1750 , and the maximum and minimum velocity that encloses the iv  civ  absorption trough ( vmax _ iv  civ  and vmin _",
    "iv  civ , respectively ) are the key parameters for our sample selection .",

    ", we analyze the 3 objects demonstrating the most prominent spiky feature in their lya emission line on top of the v  nv  absorption trough , and are thus consistent with our physical interpretion that these lines are leaked out from the bal absorption region .",
    "the basic information of these sample quasars are reported in table 1 , with visually inspected redshifts @xmath12=2.9 - 3.1 , as reported by @xcite .",
    "we observe a systematic blueshift in the @xmath0  lyman@xmath0 , v  nv , siiv  and iv  civ , when the visually determined redshift @xmath12 , highlighting the necessity of a line redshift calibration , so that the kinematics of the line - emitting ionized gas can be reliably characterized .",
    "although most of the emission lines ( especially the high - ionization broad emission lines ) are found to be systematically shifted in the quasar spectra @xcite , an apparent anti - correlation between the velocity shifts and the ionization potential is seen in both broad and narrow lines @xcite . from the above anti - correlation",
    ", we deduce that the low - ionization ii1785.4 feii@xmath17  line has an average shift of at the most 385  ^-1 kms@xmath11 , negligible in the composite quasar spectra created by @xcite . here",

    "the @xmath20 values of these sdss bal quasars are derived from the specphotoall table in sdss . to reliably characterize the continuum and delineate it from the iv  civ , v  nv  bal troughs",
    ", we fit the spectra using 165 unabsorbed quasar templates given by @xcite , which were drived from 38,377 non - bal quasars with @xmath21 and @xmath22 in sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we scale their templates using a scale factor , which is a double power - law function of the rest - frame wavelength , @xmath23\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2000\\aa}\\right)^{a[2]}+       a[3]\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2000\\aa}\\right)^{a[4 ] } \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where coefficients ( a[1],a[3 ] ) and exponents(a[2],a[4 ] ) are pinned down by minimizing the @xmath24 value .",
    "this fitting spans a wavelength range of 1050 to 2850 and we add a additional gaussian component at the @xmath0  lyman@xmath0 , v  nv , siiv  and iv  civ  locations to the unabsorbed templates to improve the fits therein .",
    "also , we iteratively mask spectral pixels lower than the model with a significance of @xmath25 on the blue side of @xmath0  lyman@xmath0 , v  nv , siiv , iv  civ  to exclude possible absorption contamination from the @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  forest . the fitting procedure is demonstrated in fig .",
    "fitting and normalizing the quasar spectra facilitate our characterization of the v  nv-@xmath0  lyman@xmath0  region . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the bottom of the v  nv  trough ( in correspondence to iv  civ ) is appoximately flat and the spectral flux is nearly zero ( lower than 5% of the continuum level ) . in our physical interpretion of the data ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , the @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  spike is leaked line emission from the unobscured emission region . when iv  civ , v  nv(@xmath0  lyman@xmath0  included ) and",
    "siiv  bal troughs are plotted in the velocity space ( fig .",
    "4 ) , we find two barely separated narrow absorption features at -1000  ^-1 kms@xmath11  to -400  ^-1 kms@xmath11   in at least two of the four ions in both j1117 + 3927 and j1140 + 6241 .        the residual flux of the v  nv  bal trough likely caused by partical covering , ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or small residuals can be scattered light as well because bal troughs are more polarized , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although approximating zero , it needs to be fully removed to recover the line profile of the @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  emission . for this purpose , we use the spectrum of the iv  civ  bal resudial flux as a template to fit the that of the nv bal trough .",
    "we note that the velocity separation of the v  nv1238.8 , 1242.8  doublet ( 966  ^-1 kms@xmath11 ) is larger than that of the iv  civ  1548.2 , 1550.8  doublet ( 503  ^-1 kms@xmath11 ) , and the latter is strongly blended .    the complex velocity structure of iv  civ  prevents us from structuring a simplestic model ( e.g. a single gaussian ) , but we have the freedom to introduce a sophisiticated mathematical formalism , since a phenominalogical ( rather than physical ) modeling is sufficient for our purposes . here , this formalism is set to be the superposition of a gaussian on a 5th - order polynomial .",
    "we increase the fitting weight by a factor of 2 for the bottom of the civ trough , so that the detailed structure in this region receives more attention from the fits . as a result , the iv  civ  velocity profiles are well represented and de - blended by the best - fit models resulting from this procedure ( fig .",
    "5 ) .    for the resonance doublet",
    "iv  civ  1548.2 , 1550.8 the ratio of their oscillator strengths ( @xmath26 = 0.19 and @xmath27 = 0.095 , respectively ) , renders an optical depth ratio of @xmath28 close to 2 ( see equation 9 ) .",
    "partial covering obscuration is generally assumed to interprete non - black absorption troughs , for which @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the covering factor and @xmath31 is the optical depth of the ion at velocity v @xcite .",
    "however , for our sample quasars with flat and nearly black troughs , we find it sufficient to derive the apparent optical depth , which is introduced only as a proxy for our procedure of analysis . hence ,",
    "for simplicity and with effectiveness , we take @xmath30=1 throughout the absorption trough , and the above formalism retrogrades to the classical beer - lambert law , @xmath32      as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the blue wing of the @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  emission line ( inside the v  nv  bal trough ) is an interplay between v  nv  absorption and the intrinsic @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  emission ( bluer than -6458  ^-1 kms@xmath11 , the velocity separation of the v  nv  red line and lya in our de - redshifted spectrum ) . to remove the residual flux in the v  nv   trough , we scale the apparent optical depths of the iv  civ  trough by a factor of @xmath33 , fit the data to @xmath34 , and perform the standard @xmath24 minimization procedure .",
    "the best - fit k values we obtain are @xmath35  and@xmath36 for sdss j1117 + 3927 , j1140 + 6241 and j1027 + 1939 , respectively . in fig .",

    "the results of the two methods are listed in table 1 . due to the narrow absorptions ,",
    "the fwhms of directly measurement are significantly smaller than that of gaussian fitting for j1117 + 3927 and j1140 + 6241 .",
    "the radii of the bal regions ( balrs ) can be estimated from the width of the the leaked @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  emission .",
    "assumption that the line - emitting gas in this region is fully varialized , the radius of the @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  emission line region ( i.e. the balr ) is related to the line width through @xmath37 where the velocity dispersion of the virialized gas @xmath38 , g is @xmath39 ( gravitational constant ) .",
    "@xmath40 is a virial factor that depends on the geometry and dynamics e.g. , @xcite , with the average values @xmath41 by observations @xcite .",

    "the balr sizes of the three sample quasars can then be estimated as follows : @xmath46      for our quasars , the sdss spectrum covers the rest - frame wavelength range of 1100 - 2500 , and the conventional approach of estimating the bolometric luminosity using the 5100   luminosity is inapplicable .",

    "in addition , our searching in the sdss archive leads to no spotted quasars within a distance of @xmath45  2.4 mpc from our targets , while clustered quasars hint for the existence of a giant nebula and a proto - cluster @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we present an estimate of the size of bal outflows for a special type of quasars , whose v  nv  absorption troughs are wide , flat and nearly black , enclosing a spiky @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  emissin line .",
    "our interpretation is that the spiky @xmath0  lyman@xmath0   emission is leaked from the bal material obscuring the broad emission line region .",
    "our systematic search in the sdss dr12q catalog renders 3 quasars prominently characterizing the above feature . under the assumption that the line - emitting gas is virialized",
    ", we estimate that the fwhm of the @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  spikes ( @xmath45  2000  ^-1 kms@xmath11 ) indicates a size of their outflows to be of the order 3 - 26 parsecs , similar or moderately larger than the theoretically investigated trough forming region ( 0.01 - 0.1 pc ) for accretion disc line - driven winds @xcite .",
    "the lower limits of @xmath90 are 0.02%-0.07% which are substantially smaller than that is required to have significant feedback effect on their host galaxies .",
    "3/58 of quasars with flat iv  civ  absorption troughs show spiky @xmath0  lyman@xmath0  emission line , it may indicate that the small scale balrs are rare .",
    "although the outflow radii of a number of individual quasars measured using density - sensitive absorption lines from excited levels often find tens to 100 - 1000 pc scales , this contraversy has been long - standing in this field @xcite , and no available data that facilitate a direct comparison for our quasar sample .",
