    "the reservoirs shall consist of non - interacting electrons with a continuous , homogenous , infinite spectrum and they shall be in thermal equilibrium at all times .",
    "their occupation numbers accordingly obey a fermi distribution .",
    "the one - electron spectra on the @xmath4 nanoparticles are considered to be discrete and on dot @xmath9 we consider explicitly @xmath10 levels with level spacing @xmath11 .",
    "the coulomb interaction is incorporated by the capacitance model which is detailed in the next section .",
    "we consider mutual capacitances between nearest neighbours like e.g. @xmath12 as well as between distant conductors like e.g. @xmath13 .",
    "potentials can be applied to the reservoirs ( @xmath14 ) and a gate ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the uncontrollable influence of the dna creates background charges on the dots ( indicated by the random potentials @xmath16 ) .",
    "the perturbation comprises three types of transitions : _ transitions within the array _ we consider phonon assisted tunneling between the one - electron levels of nearest neighboring dots ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the tunneling matrix element @xmath18 is assumed to be equal for all tunneling transitions within the array .",
    "the phonon assisted tunneling stems from a linear coupling of a bosonic bath ( bosonic bath 2 ) and the electronic degrees of freedom in the array@xcite . here",
    "the bosonic bath shall model phonons in the substrate .",
    "_ transitions between array and reservoir _ we include tunneling between the continuous reservoirs and the one - electron levels of the outermost nanoparticles where no phonon assistance is considered here ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the tunneling matrix element @xmath20 for these transitions is considered to be equal for both reservoirs but generally different from @xmath21 .",
    "_ transitions on a single dot _ these transitions among the one - electron levels on a single dot ( @xmath22 ) can be justified microscopically by a frhlich - hamiltonian@xcite ( coupling to bosonic bath 1 ) .",
    "we assume that the tunneling matrix elements have phases which fluctuate randomly due to slight temporary changes of the array geometry .",
    "implicit summation over these phases prohibits any first order contributions of the tunneling matrix elements to the perturbation expansion .",
    "the transition rates which are given in the next section are determined by the transition energies , i.e. the changes in energy of the array that accompany the transitions of an electron from one level to another .",
    "it is composed of a change in electrostatic and one - electron energy .",
    "the former is computed within the capacitance model : the reservoirs , the gate and the dots are treated as macroscopic conductors with potentials @xmath23 and total charges @xmath24 .",
    "we call the gate and the reservoirs voltage nodes ( with potentials @xmath25 and charges @xmath26 ) since their potential is fixed , the dots are called charge nodes ( with potentials @xmath27 and charges @xmath28 ) since their charge is known and their potentials have to be determined@xcite . the potentials and the charges are related by the capacitance matrix @xmath29 @xmath30 the relation between the mutual capacitances @xmath31 indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] and the elements of the capacitance matrix @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 .",
    "the electrostatic energy can be written as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the polarization charge induced by the potentials @xmath25 on the voltage nodes and @xmath36 are fixed background charges which account for the electrostatic influence of the dna and unknown fabricational details .",
    "the potentials on the charge nodes are then : @xmath37 furthermore we have to take into account the electronic spectra of the nanoparticles : the one - electron energy @xmath38 of level @xmath39 on dot @xmath9 is @xmath40 with the fermi energy @xmath41 on dot @xmath9 .",

    "obviously , the behaviour of the system depends strongly both on the values of the mutual capacitances@xcite and the one - electron level spacings . concerning the former we determine the capacitance matrix numerically with the help of `` fastcap''@xcite using the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geomex ] .",
    "only qualitatively we estimate the magnitude of the one - electron level spacing of a single , neutral , isolated nanoparticle@xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the electron density , @xmath56 the nanoparticle radius and the numerical value for @xmath57 was calculated for bulk gold .",
    "dft calculations @xcite and experiments @xcite suggest that this estimation can at least reproduce the correct order of magnitude .",
    "we assume that the tunneling rates defined below are much smaller than @xmath58 so that we can treat the tunneling part of the hamiltonian as a perturbation ( weak coupling regime ) and consider only the lowest non - vanishing order of the perturbation expansion ( sequential tunneling regime ) . the reservoir and bath degrees of freedom of the density matrix",
    "are traced out which results in the reduced density matrix .",
    "we neglect its non - diagonal elements , which is justified if the broadening of the levels due to tunneling is small compared to the level spacing .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath59 can then be interpreted as the probabilities of the array states @xmath60 where the array state @xmath61 is given by all occupation numbers @xmath62 of level @xmath39 on dot @xmath9 : @xmath63 .",
    "the rates of electron transfer are calculated in golden rule approximation , thereby assuming that transport is incoherent and no coherent eigenstates are formed which stretch over the whole array , comparable to molecular orbitals .",
    "this is justified since in reality there are certainly processes which destroy the phase coherence ",
    "e.g. slight temporary changes in the geometry of the array .    under",
    "the given assumptions the probabilities @xmath59 obey a master equation in the stationary limit@xcite @xmath64 with golden rule rates @xmath65 from array state @xmath61 to array state @xmath66 .",
    "each transition rate belongs to exactly one of the following sets :    _ transitions within the array _ from level @xmath39 on dot @xmath9 to level @xmath42 on dot @xmath43 @xmath67 where @xmath21 is the tunnneling matrix element within the array .",
    "the function @xmath68 is the probability per energy for the exchange of energy @xmath69 with the bosonic bath and therefore has to be normalized and must fulfill the condition of detailed balance@xcite @xmath70 .",
    "the latter property stems from the nature of the bosonic bath : while it is always possible to emit energy , there must be excited bosons in the bath if energy shall be absorbed . the @xmath68 function",
    "given above is an assumption which is preferably simple and has the required properties .",
    "_ transitions between array and reservoir _ from / to lead @xmath47 into / out of level @xmath39 on the neighbouring dot @xmath71 where @xmath20 is the tunnneling matrix element between a reservoir and the neighbouring dot , @xmath72 is the density of states in the reservoir @xmath47 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",

    "since , as in the case of tunneling within the array , these transitions are possible due to the coupling to a bosonic bath , the rates fulfill detailed balance : @xmath79 .",
    "if the nanoparticles were isolated , i.e. if there were no transitions among them , it follows from the detailed balance property that in the stationary limit the occupation numbers @xmath62 obey a fermi distribution .",
    "so while the tunneling transitions drive the electron distribution out of equilibrium the transitions on single dots effectively cool the electrons .",
    "if we consider @xmath10 levels on dot @xmath9 there are @xmath80 possible array states .",
    "so the master equation defies a direct numerical solution except for very small systems .",
    "therefore we employ a monte carlo ( mc ) method to retrieve the quantities of interest : the current and the shot noise .",
    "the key idea of the mc method@xcite in this context is to discretize time and to get from the transition rate @xmath65 a transition probability @xmath81 by multiplying the rate with a finite time step @xmath82 which may depend on the present system state @xmath61 : @xmath83 the time step has to be chosen sufficiently small so that for the total probability @xmath84 to leave the state @xmath61 it holds @xmath85 the transitions among the array states , which are governed by the probabilities @xmath81 , constitute a stochastic process which can be simulated with the help of random numbers .",
    "in contrast to the mc method used in statistical physics@xcite which samples a ( grand ) canonical ensemble , the system examined here is generally out of equilibrium . in each valid mc algorithm",
    "the probability @xmath84 must be properly represented .",
    "we write it as follows : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the number of possible transitions out of a state @xmath61 and @xmath88 is an upper bound for the transition rates which is also called attempt frequency .",
    "if we choose the time step @xmath82 as @xmath89 , the transition probability reduces to : @xmath90 note that with the upper choice of the time step the requirement is fulfilled since @xmath91 and the number of nonzero addends is @xmath87 .",
    "it is straightforward to imagine the corresponding algorithm if you regard each factor in as an independent probability , see fig .  [",

    "accept the choice with probability @xmath94 , 4 .",
    "if the transition is accepted , update the state of the system , especially the total number of possible transitions @xmath87 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we found that even though our algorithm needs two random numbers per time step and an attempt transition may be rejected , see step 3 in fig .  [ fig : mcalgo2 ] , it is convenient since only one rate has to be computed per time step . for systems with many possible transitions",
    "it is faster than algorithms which need the transition rates of all possible transitions in each time step@xcite .",
    "furthermore our algorithm has the convenient property to be self - adapting to the system size : since @xmath95 the number of performed steps scales with the amount of possible transitions if the runtime of the simulation is fixed .    despite the optimized algorithm we can take only a finite number of one - electron levels into account , of course . in most cases , however , we want to model wide bands on the dots , i.e.  we do not want to observe any impact of the finiteness of the electron spectrum .",
    "practically we increase the number of considered levels until the results become steady for the maximum bias voltage which we want to apply . in order to minimize the computing time , i.e. real time",
    ", we consider as few levels as possible , of course .",
    "therefore we center the spectra around the highest occupied levels in the ground state ( i.e.  the state assumed in equilibrium at zero temperature ) since for small bias voltages and low temperatures only low - lying excitations about the fermi edge appear . to determine the ground state the total energy of the system which includes the electrostatic energy and the one - electron energies has to be minimized . due to the discreteness of the charges @xmath28",
    "this is a non - trivial minimization problem which we do not address here .",
    "the initial state of a simulation run is always the ground state , i.e.  all spectra are half - filled .",
    "each run starts with an equilibration period @xmath96 in which we let the system evolve , by iterating the algorithm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mcalgo2 ] ) , without sampling the assumed states .",
    "so the system can reach its stationary state . in the subsequent measurement period @xmath97 the quantities of interest",
    "are retrieved .",
    "the current can simply be obtained by counting the electrons that are transferred e.g.  between the left lead and the first nanoparticle and dividing by the length of the measurement period @xmath97 : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the charge that is transferred during the measurement time @xmath97 .",
    "note that in the stationary state the current through all tunneling barriers is the same . for a fixed set of parameters the simulation is repeated with different seeds for the random number generator in order to get statistically independent runs . with this ensemble we can determine the statistical standard error of the mean current .",
    "the ( zero - frequency ) shot noise @xmath100 and the fano factor @xmath101 can also be estimated@xcite : @xmath102 where @xmath103 denotes the ensemble average .",
    "as for the current , in the stationary limit the shot noise is the same for all tunneling barriers .",
    "note that all given quantities are estimators which become exact in the limit @xmath104 .",
    "the validity of our method was checked by comparing our results with the solution of the master equation for a small system . with the same benchmark sensible values for the simulation parameters ( equilibration and measurement time , size of the ensemble )",
    "were obtained .",
    "due to the self - adaptive property of the algorithm these parameters are also suitable for bigger systems . for each geometry",
    "we increased the number of considered one - electron levels until the iv curves became steady .",
    "furthermore we found that the computing time scales linearly with the number of nanoparticles @xmath4 and quadratically with the maximum number of considered levels on a dot ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "it is exponentially smaller than the computing time needed for the direct solution of the master equation which scales as @xmath106 .",
    "however , note that the mc method is not equivalent to a solution of the master equation : though the current and shot noise may be retrieved from a mc simulation , it is practically impossible to determine all probabilities @xmath59 correctly .      to interpret the simulated results we draw a sample out of a single simulation run and look at the probabilities of charge configurations and mean rates among them . to get the probability @xmath107 of a certain charge configuration @xmath108",
    ", we sum the mc times during which this configuration is assumed and divide by the total mc time .",
    "the mean rate @xmath109 through a tunneling junction @xmath9 from state @xmath29 to state @xmath110 to the right or left respectively is determined by counting the transitions between state @xmath29 and state @xmath110 by tunneling in the given direction through junction @xmath9 and dividing the sum by the mc time that is spend in the state @xmath29 .",
    "the current through a tunneling junction @xmath9 can then be written as @xmath111 . in the stationary state",
    "the currents through the junctions are all equal to one another @xmath112 , so we can write the current as @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . the partial current @xmath116 from charge state @xmath29",

    "the iv curves for intermediate relaxation rates lie between the curves belonging to the extreme cases .",
    "these tendencies can also be observed for other gate voltages and other array lengths .",
    "they can be understood by noting that a high relaxation rate keeps the mean occupation of the one - electron levels on a dot close to the equilibrium i.e.  fermi distribution . for @xmath137",
    "this leads to the formation of a defined fermi edge on the nanoparticles .",
    "that is the reason why the steps in the iv curve become distinct .",

    "we start with two nanoparticles and let the number of nanoparticles and therefore the array length grow so that we discover certain features which evolve systematically with increased length . on the other hand it is interesting to combine small and big nanoparticles since they differ strongly both in level spacing and charging energy . in the case of 5 nanoparticles , which is the longest array that is studied here , the diameters of the nanoparticles range from @xmath129 to @xmath144 in steps of @xmath145 .",

    "participate so it should be less important whether a certain state takes part or not : what we observe is their `` average '' contribution .",
    "that is why the curves for different gate voltages coincide for high bias voltages .",

    "we find that @xmath147 and @xmath148 both increase with an increasing array length .",
    "the increase of @xmath148 with an increasing array length has also been observed elsewhere @xcite so it seems to be quite generic for arrays .",
    "one factor which contributes to this tendency is the decrease of the capacitances with increasing distance between the conductors .",
    "especially the capacitances that couple the leads with the nanoparticles @xmath152 , see eq .",
    ", are important .",
    "the cpacitances extracted from the geometry with the help of `` fastcap '' @xcite do not decrease linearly , like e.g.  for a simple parallel plate capacitor , but approximately exponential .",
    "this is reasonable since the nanoparticles partially screen the electric field . for two neighbouring nanoparticles that are in the middle of the array the difference between the coupling capacitances",
    "so we have to apply a high bias voltage to create a potential difference between these two particles which permits a tunneling transition , see eq .  .",
    "therefore the threshold voltages and @xmath148 increase with increasing array length . concerning @xmath147 the change of the number of transport paths with increasing bias voltage plays an important role .",
    "this change is in turn determined by the change of the number of possible transitions . a certain transition between two neighbouring dots becomes possible when the potential gradient between the dots becomes high enough .",
    "if we assume that this gradient is roughly the bias voltage divided by the number of tunnel junctions then we should expect that @xmath147 decreases with increasing array length . on the other hand",
    "we `` grow '' the array by adding bigger nanoparticles with a higher density of one - electron states .",
    "given that the number of extra electrons in the array is small a higher number of one - electron levels within the bias voltage window results in a higher current .",
    "this effect might overcompensate the reduced potential gradient which would result in the observed behaviour of @xmath147 . to check this assertion",
    "we have artificially raised the level spacing on the last dot in the 3 particle array so that it is equal to the level spacing on the first dot : in this case we find that the overall conductance @xmath147 is only @xmath125 compared to @xmath153 with the original level spacing .",
    "so @xmath147 can indeed be lowered by raising the level spacing on the last dot .",

    "both suppositions are violated in our case : we assume that the phase information is lost at every tunneling event and we include coulomb interaction , see sections [ subsec : hamil ] and [ subsec : transport ] . therefore , in our case , asymmetry is present in general unless special symmetries impose symmetric curves .",
    "we will discuss now two symmetries that are actually relevant in our case . by explicitly showing how these symmetries are broken by the coulomb interaction and the distribution of the density of states ( inverse level spacing ) the occurence of asymmetric iv curves",

    "we adopt the framework of the orthodox theory for these considerations since the basic mechanisms can be understood by looking at charge states alone .",
