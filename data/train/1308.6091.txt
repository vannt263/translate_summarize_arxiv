    "a neutron - star low - mass x - ray binary ( ns - lmxb ) consists of a roche - lobe - filling low - mass star and a mass - accreting neutron star with a weak magnetic field of @xmath13 g. these x - ray sources generally have two spectral states , namely the soft and hard states ( e.g. mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ; mitsuda et al . 1989",
    "; white & mason 1985 ; white et al . 1988 ) . in the soft state ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum is relatively soft , and comprises two major optically - thick emission components .",
    "the softer of them is a disk blackbody with a temperature of @xmath14 kev , and the harder one is a blackbody of temperature @xmath15 kev , often weakly comptonized as evidenced by data excess towards higher energies @xcite .",
    "in addition , a harder emission component , possibly of non - thermal nature , may underlie the optically - thick spectrum @xcite .    in the hard state",
    ", the spectrum has a hard power - law - like shape that also consists of two emission components . a soft thermal component and a hard one with strong comptonization .",
    "there have been a degeneracy between two modelings of the emission .",
    "one invokes a soft disk blackbody plus a comptonized blackbody , while the other a soft blackbody plus a hard comptonized disk blackbody @xcite .",
    "@xcite , hereafter paper 1 , showed that the former modeling is preferred by broad - band suzaku data of the ns - lmxb aquila x-1 ( hereafter aql x-1 ) : the blackbody emission from the neutron - star surface is strongly comptonized by a hot spherical corona , resulting in a hard continuum approximated by a power - law photon index of @xmath16 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "[ table_6thand7th ]    among the seven observations , obs@xmath17 6 and 7 covered the faintest phase , wherein the source intensity had already decreased rapidly .",
    "the 0.810 kev intensity ( table [ table_obsproperty ] ) on these two occasions are no higher than @xmath18% of that in obs@xmath17 5 , and the spectra on these occasions are much more clearly concave at @xmath3 kev than that of obs@xmath17 5",
    ". nevertheless , the spectra are still quantitatively similar in shape to that of obs@xmath17 5 .",
    "therefore , we proceeded to fit these spectra with a blackbody plus its comptonization , namely , the same two alternative models as used in obs@xmath17 5 which in turn are both natural extensions to that for obs@xmath17 24 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig_6thand7th ] ( panels a and b ) and table [ table_6thand7th ] , the obs@xmath17 6 spectrum was successfully reproduced by either model like in section [ ss_obs5 ] . according to model 1 ,",
    "the coronal temperature remained approximately the same as in obs@xmath17 5 , but the coronal optical depth decreased from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "this low optical depth enables more blackbody photons to pass through the corona without any scattering , to make the zero - scattered component stand out at @xmath21 kev and make the spectrum look more concave . in model 2",
    ", the coronal parameters turned out to be consistent within errors with those of obs@xmath17 5 .",
    "what makes the spectrum more concave is the change of coronal covering fraction , namely , ratio between the seed photon area to the total ( seed plus direct ) blackbody area .",
    "in fact , from obs@xmath17 5 to obs@xmath17 6 , the ratio changed from @xmath22 to @xmath23 ( though the errors are large ) , so that the direct blackbody component became stronger .    as shown in figure [ fig_6thand7th ] ( panels c and d ) , the obs@xmath17 7 spectrum was also well reproduced by either model 1 or model 2 .",
    "the more prominent concaveness of the obs@xmath17 7 spectrum , than that of obs@xmath17 6 , can be explained as a further change of the model parameters , from obs@xmath17 5 through obs@xmath17 6 , and to obs@xmath17 7 . if , e.g. , model 1 is employed , the optical depth further decreased to @xmath24 ( table [ table_6thand7th ] ) . if , instead , model 2 is employed , the spectral change from obs@xmath17 6 to obs@xmath17 7 is mainly attributed to the increase ( though with large errors ) in the coronal electron temperature , which made the comptonization continuum harder .    by extrapolating the best - fit two models , like in section [ ss_obs5 ] , we calculated the luminosity in the 0.8100 kev band .",
    "the results are shown in table [ table_6thand7th ] .",
    "in the present study , we analyzed five wide - band suzaku spectra of aql x-1 ( the 2nd , 4th , 5th , 6th , and 7th ) among the seven observations conducted over decay phase of the 2007 september - october outburst .",
    "if the individual 0.8100 kev luminosities ( section [ s : spectral_analysis ] ; either directly measured or extrapolated ) are normalized to the eddington luminosity of @xmath25 erg s@xmath1 for an object of @xmath26 , we obtain the eddington ratios of 0.077 for obs@xmath17 1 , @xmath27 for obs@xmath17 2 , 3 , and 4 , @xmath28 for obs@xmath17 5 , and @xmath29 for the last two observations .",
    "thus , during these observations , the luminosity changed by @xmath3 orders of magnitude , and the spectra ( figure [ fig_allobs ] ) changed drastically meanwhile .",
    "like in obs@xmath17 3 already reported in paper 1 , obs@xmath17 2 and obs@xmath17 4 caught the source in the typical hard state , wherein the spectra were reproduced by a strongly comptonized blackbody plus a weaker disk blackbody .",
    "the innermost disk radii , @xmath30 km ( obs@xmath17 2 ) and @xmath31 km ( obs@xmath17 4 ) , and the blackbody radii , @xmath32 km ( obs@xmath17 2 ) and @xmath33 km ( obs@xmath17 4 ) , are all consistent with those of obs@xmath17 3 .",
    "thus , at these luminosities , the standard disk is truncated at a radius of @xmath34 km , and the accreting matter then transforms into an optically - thin , geometrically - thick coronal flow . as discussed in paper 1 , this flow is considered to accrete almost spherically onto the neutron star and make its entire surface emit the blackbody photons with a temperature of @xmath35 kev and a radius of @xmath36 km ( table [ table_2ndand4th ] ) .",
    "these photons are then compton scattered by the succeeding coronal flows .    the spectra of obs@xmath17 5@xmath377 are reproduced by a blackbody and its comptonization , without the disk component which is probably below the xis energy band . in these three faintest data sets , it is ambiguous , however , whether the blackbody source is covered entirely by a relatively thin ( @xmath38 ) and very hot ( @xmath39 kev ) corona ( model 1 ) , or partially by a thicker ( @xmath40 ) and cooler ( @xmath41 kev ) one ( model 2 ) .",
    "the characteristic hump below @xmath3 kev seen in these spectra can be explained either by those blackbody photons which escaped through the thin corona without scattering ( model 1 ) , or emission from those regions on the neutron star which are not covered by the thick corona ( model 2 ) .    given the model ambiguity in the dimmest three data sets , we may ask ourselves whether the obs@xmath17 2@xmath374 data , which have so far been analyzed with model 1 ( plus diskbb ) , can also be described with model 2 ( plus diskbb ) . to see this",
    ", we fitted the obs@xmath17 2@xmath374 spectra with a model diskbb + compps + bbody + gauss , wherein the additional blackbody component , representing surface emission without coronal obscuration , was constrained to have the same temperature as the compton seed photons .",
    "then , the directly visible blackbody was found to little contribute , with the radius of @xmath42 km , @xmath43 km , and @xmath44 km from obs@xmath17 2 , obs@xmath17 3 and obs@xmath17 4 , respectively . in none of these cases ,",
    "the fit improvement was significant .",
    "therefore , these data sets prefer model 1 , in agreement with paper 1 in which the corona was concluded to be approximately spherical .",
    "an important source property revealed by analyzing the seven data sets is luminosity - dependent changes in @xmath45 , which hold regardless of the model 1/model 2 ambiguity .",
    "this is evident in figure [ fig : rbbfig ] , where @xmath45 is plotted against the eddington - normalized 0.8100 kev luminosity . as discussed in paper 1 , the small value of @xmath45 in obs@xmath17 1 is considered to mean that the accretion in the soft state occurs only onto an equatorial region of the neutron star . as @xmath46 decreased to @xmath47 erg s@xmath1 ( obs@xmath17 2@xmath374 ) and the source made a transition into the hard state , the emission radius increased to @xmath36 km , which is consistent with the neutron - star radius @xmath48 .",
    "this is thought to be a consequence of the nearly spherical coronal flow ( paper 1 ) .",
    "as the source became still dimmer , @xmath45 started decreasing again , down to @xmath3 km at a luminosity of @xmath2 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : rbbfig ] by a solid line , the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath46 ( in obs@xmath17 2 to obs@xmath17 7 ) is approximated as @xmath49 .",
    "( 88mm,120mm)figure6.eps    the decrease of @xmath45 towards lower luminosity is presumably due to some collimation of the optically - thin accretion flow .",
    "this , in turn , is likely to be caused by the emergence of a neutron - star magnetosphere which is usually negligible when the source is luminous .",
    "to evaluate this idea , let us recall that the alfven radius @xmath50 ( for spherical accretion ) depends on the mass accretion rate @xmath51 as @xmath52 ( elsner & lamb 1977 ) , where @xmath53 is the neutron - star magnetic field ; here we assumed the neutron - star mass and radius of @xmath54 and @xmath55 km , respectively , and the magnetic field of dipolar configuration .",
    "we may consider that @xmath45 starts decreasing in figure [ fig : rbbfig ] at an eddington ratio of @xmath56 , or @xmath57 erg s@xmath1 , because the magnetic field starts to affect the accretion flow , or equivalently , @xmath58 becomes comparable to or larger than @xmath48 .",
    "this , together with equation [ eq : alfvenradius ] , yields @xmath59 g.    since the rotation frequency of aql x-1 is considered as @xmath60550 hz ( zhang et al@xmath17 1998 ; casella et al@xmath17 2008 ) , the corotation radius is calculated as @xmath61 employing the field strength obtained above , @xmath58 is then inferred to exceed @xmath62 at @xmath63 erg s@xmath1 . at such low luminosities ( like in obs@xmath17 6 and obs@xmath17 7 )",
    ", the accreting matter will be strongly affected by the magnetic pressure , and will start extracting the angular momentum from the neutron star before it reaches @xmath64 .",
    "this effect , often called  propeller effect \" @xcite , can explain the large luminosity drop from obs@xmath17 5 to obs@xmath17 6 and obs@xmath17 7 .",
    "although @xmath65 was found to reduce as @xmath51 decreases , the effect could be some artifact ; e.g. due to radiative transfer in the ns atmosphere ( e.g. heinke et al@xmath17 2006 ) . as an independent examination ,",
    "let us consider here the luminosity dependence of the coronal optical depth @xmath66 .",
    "after equation ( 6 ) of paper i , the mass continuity condition along the radius @xmath67 can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mean molecular weight of ions , @xmath70 is the proton mass , @xmath71 is the flow density , @xmath72 is the flow cross section ( @xmath73 if spherical ) , @xmath74 is the free fall velocity , and @xmath75 denotes possible deviation of the actual inflow velocity from @xmath76 ( paper 1 ) . assuming that @xmath51 is constant , that @xmath77 approximately scales as @xmath78 ( nearly radial flow ) , and that @xmath79 depends only weakly on @xmath67 , equation ( [ eq : mass_continuity ] ) yields @xmath80 where subscript 0 specifies values on the neutron - star surface , @xmath81 .",
    "like equation ( 7 ) in paper i , we may integrate this from @xmath82 to an outer coronal radius @xmath83 , to express the optical depth as @xmath84 further assuming @xmath85 and a negligible dependence of @xmath75 on @xmath51 , we finally obtain @xmath86 where @xmath51 was replaced with the 0.8100 kev luminosity @xmath46 .    to see the behavior of this @xmath87 , the values of @xmath88 for model 1 were calculated from table 2 , table 3 , and table 4 , and are shown in figure [ fig : rbb - l_tau ] against @xmath65 .",
    "the four data points indicate a very tight relation as @xmath89 .",
    "combined with equation ( [ eq : flow_cross_sec ] ) , this implies @xmath90 , which is close to the @xmath91 scaling expected if @xmath65 is correctly estimated . further incorporating the scaling of figure [ fig : rbbfig ] , we find @xmath92 , which reconfirms that the flow becomes indeed constrained onto a limited surface area as @xmath46 decreases . in other words",
    ", @xmath66 decreased only by less than an order of magnitude as the luminosity became lower by more than 2 orders of magnitude ( from obs@xmath17 2@xmath374 to obs@xmath17 5@xmath377 ) , because the flow became more strongly funneled onto limited regions ( most likely the magnetic poles ) .",
    "( 75mm,120mm)figure7.eps    if , instead , applying the same method to model 2 ( in obs@xmath17 5@xmath377 ) by substituting @xmath93 for the saturated @xmath66 , the dependence becomes @xmath94 , of which the power index is too much larger than the normal value 2 ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "through these arguments , we consider that model 1 is more preferable than model 2 , in agreement with the inference made at the end of subsection 4.1 .",
    "the configuration of model 1 is still possible even when the coronal flow is funneled onto the magnetic poles , because the flow would be rather spherical at @xmath96 .",
    "this means that model 1 ( sometimes with an addition of diskbb ) can describe the broad - band spectrum of aql x-1 in the hard state from obs@xmath17 2 through obs@xmath17 7 , over @xmath15 orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "however , the reality could be an intermediate condition between model 1 and model 2 .      summarizing the results obtained so far",
    ", the @xmath51-dependent changes in the accretion geometry of an ns - lmxb may be described in the following manner , in terms of the four radii , @xmath50 , @xmath62 , @xmath97 , and @xmath82 ( matsuoka & asai 2012 ) .    1 .",
    "when @xmath51 is high and hence @xmath98 , the gravity is dominant in the accretion ( corresponding to obs@xmath17 1 ) .",
    "the optically - thick disk continues down to @xmath99 .",
    "as @xmath51 decreases , the system makes a transition into the hard state . since @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the gravity is still dominant , but the disk becomes truncated at @xmath102 , and the matter accretes nearly spherically onto the neutron star ( obs@xmath17 2@xmath374 ) .",
    "3 .   when @xmath51 decreases to make @xmath103 , the effect of magnetic field begins to stand out .",
    "the flow becomes anisotropic , and funneled onto the magnetic poles ( obs@xmath17 5 ) .",
    "as @xmath51 further decreases , the magnetic field becomes more dominant , resulting in a condition of @xmath104 .",
    "the propeller effect ( lamb et al@xmath17 1973 ) hampers the accretion , thus causing a rapid luminosity decrease .",
    "however , a small fraction can still fall along the magnetic field lines onto a small area at the magnetic poles ( obs@xmath17 6 and obs@xmath17 7 ) .",
    "through an analysis of the seven suzaku data sets of aquila x-1 tracing an outburst decay , we obtained spectra at various luminosities ( from @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 to @xmath2 erg s@xmath1 ) , and carried out model fitting to each of them .",
    "consequently we obtained the results as below .    1 .",
    "like obs@xmath17 3 which we reported in paper 1 , obs@xmath17 2 and obs@xmath17 4 had luminosities of @xmath105 erg s@xmath1 , and showed typical characteristics of the hard state .",
    "the spectra are composed of a comptonized blackbody emission from the whole neutron - star surface and a softer emission from a truncated disk .",
    "the spectra of obs@xmath17 5 , obs@xmath17 6 , and obs@xmath17 7 were reproduced either by a comptonized blackbody ( model 1 ) or that with directly - seen blackbody ( model 2 ) .",
    "the obtained radius of the blackbody emission was significantly smaller than 10 km and decreased along with the luminosity , regardless of the model ambiguity .",
    "3 .   we clarified luminosity dependence of @xmath45 , which is approximated as @xmath49 .",
    "this can be considered as an evidence the emergence of a neutron - star magnetosphere , which confines the accretion flow onto the magnetic poles .",
    "the decrease of @xmath45 toward the lower luminosity was reconfirmed independently based on the coronal optical depth .",
    "5 .   as to obs@xmath17 5 , obs@xmath17 6 and obs@xmath17 7 , model 1",
    "is considered to be more appropriate than model 2 , although the reality could be in between ."
