    "understanding all the consequences of the interplay between band structure effects and electron - electron interactions remains one of the present - day goals of theoretical solid - state physics .",
    "one of the simplest model that contains the essence of this problem is the hubbard model . in the more than thirty years@xcite@xcite",
    "since this model was formulated , much progress has been accomplished . in one dimension,@xcite@xcite various techniques such as diagrammatic resummations,@xcite bosonization,@xcite renormalization group@xcite@xcite and conformal approaches@xcite@xcite",
    "have lead to a very detailed understanding of correlation functions , from weak to strong coupling . similarly , in infinite dimensions a dynamical mean - field theory@xcite leads to an essentially exact solution of the model , although many results must be obtained by numerically solving self - consistent integral equations .",
    "detailed comparisons with experimental results on transition - metal oxides have shown that three - dimensional materials can be well described by the infinite - dimensional self - consistent mean - field approach.@xcite other methods , such as slave - boson@xcite or slave - fermion@xcite approaches , have also allowed one to gain insights into the hubbard model through various mean - field theories corrected for fluctuations . in this context however , the mean - field theories are not based on a variational principle . instead , they are generally based on expansions in the inverse of a degeneracy parameter,@xcite such as the number of fermion flavors @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is taken to be large despite the fact that the physical limit corresponds to a small value of this parameter , say @xmath3 . hence these theories must be used in conjunction with other approaches to estimate their limits of validity.@xcite expansions around solvable limits have also been explored.@xcite finally , numerical solutions,@xcite with proper account of finite - size effects , can often provide a way to test the range of validity of approximation methods independently of experiments on materials that are generally described by much more complicated hamiltonians .    despite all this progress",
    ", we are still lacking reliable theoretical methods that work in arbitrary space dimension . in two dimensions in particular",
    ", it is believed that the hubbard model may hold the key to understanding normal state properties of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "but even the simpler goal of understanding the magnetic phase diagram of the hubbard model in two dimensions is a challenge .",
    "traditional mean - field techniques , or even slave - boson mean - field approaches , for studying magnetic instabilities of interacting electrons fail in two dimensions .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) for example does not satisfy the pauli principle , and furthermore it predicts finite temperature antiferromagnetic or spin density wave ( sdw ) transitions while this is forbidden by the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "even though one can study universal critical behavior using various forms of renormalization group treatments@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite or through the self - consistent - renormalized approach of moriya@xcite which all satisfy the mermin - wagner theorem in two dimensions , cutoff - dependent scales are left undetermined by these approaches .",
    "this means that the range of interactions or fillings for which a given type of ground - state magnetic order may appear is left undetermined .    amongst the recently developed theoretical methods for understanding both collective and single - particle properties of the hubbard model , one should note the fluctuation exchange approximation@xcite ( flex ) and the pseudo - potential parquet approach.@xcite the first one , flex , is based on the idea of conserving approximations proposed by baym and kadanoff.@xcite@xcite this approach starts with a set of skeleton diagrams for the luttinger - ward functional@xcite to generate a self - energy that is computed self - consistently .",
    "the choice of initial diagrams however is arbitrary and left to physical intuition . in the pseudo - potential parquet approach , one parameterizes response functions in all channels , and then one iterates crossing - symmetric many - body integral equations .",
    "while the latter approach partially satisfies the pauli principle , it violates conservation laws .",
    "the opposite is true for flex .    in this paper , we present the formal aspects of a new approach that we have recently developed for the hubbard model @xcite@xcite .",
    "the approach is based on enforcing sum rules and conservation laws , rather than on diagrammatic perturbative methods that are not valid for interaction @xmath4 larger than hopping @xmath5 .",
    "we first start from a luttinger - ward functional that is parameterized by two irreducible vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 that are local in space - time .",
    "this generates rpa - like equations for spin and charge fluctuations that are conserving .",
    "the local - moment sum rule , local charge sum rule , and the constraint imposed by the pauli principle , @xmath8 then allow us to find the vertices as a function of double occupancy @xmath9 ( see eqs.([charge ] ) and ( [ spin ] ) ) . since @xmath10 is a local quantity it depends very little on the size of the system and , in principle , it could be obtained reliably using numerical methods , such as for example monte carlo simulations . here , however , we adopt another approach and find @xmath10 self - consistently@xcite without any input from outside the present theory .",
    "this is done by using an _ ansatz _ eq .",
    "( [ usp ] ) for the double - occupancy @xmath10 that has been inspired by ideas from the local field approach of singwi et al.@xcite .",
    "once we have the spin and charge fluctuations , the next step is to use them to compute a new approximation , eq.([param ] ) , for the single - particle self - energy .",
    "this approach to the calculation of the effect of collective modes on single - particle properties@xcite is similar in spirit to paramagnon theories.@xcite contrary to these approaches however , we _ do _ include vertex corrections in such a way that , if @xmath11 is our new approximation for the self - energy while @xmath12 is the initial green s function used in the calculation of the collective modes , and @xmath9 is the value obtained from spin and charge susceptibilities , then @xmath13 = u\\left\\langle n_{\\uparrow } n_{\\downarrow } \\right\\rangle $ ] is satisfied exactly .",
    "the extent to which @xmath14 $ ] ( computed with @xmath15 instead of @xmath16 ) differs from @xmath17 can then be used both as an internal accuracy check and as a way to improve the vertex corrections .",
    "if one is interested only in two - particle properties , namely spin and charge fluctuations , then this approach has the simple physical appeal of rpa but it satisfies key constraints that are always violated by rpa , namely the mermin - wagner theorem and the pauli principle . to contrast it with usual rpa , that has a self - consistency only at the single - particle level ,",
    "we call it the two - particle self - consistent approach ( tpsc).@xcite@xcite@xcite the tpsc gives a _ quantitative _ description of the hubbard model not only far from phase transitions , but also upon entering the critical regime .",
    "indeed we have shown quantitative agreement with monte carlo simulations of the nearest - neighbor@xcite and next - nearest neighbor@xcite hubbard model in two dimensions .",
    "quantitative agreement is also obtained as one enters the narrow critical regime accessible in monte carlo simulations .",
    "we also have shown@xcite in full generality that the tpsc approach gives the @xmath18 limit of the @xmath19 model , while @xmath20 is the physically correct ( heisenberg ) limit . in two dimensions ,",
    "we then recover both quantum - critical@xcite and renormalized classical@xcite regimes to leading order in @xmath21 .",
    "since there is no arbitrariness in cutoff , given a microscopic hubbard model no parameter is left undetermined .",
    "this allows us to go with the same theory from the non - critical to the beginning of the critical regime , thus providing quantitative estimates for the magnetic phase diagram of the hubbard model , not only in two dimensions but also in higher dimensions@xcite .",
    "the main limitation of the approach presented in this paper is that it is valid only from weak to intermediate coupling .",
    "the strong - coupling case can not be treated with frequency - independent irreducible vertices , as will become clear later . however",
    ", a suitable ansatz for these irreducible vertices in a luttinger - ward functional might allow us to apply our general scheme to this limit as well .",
    "our approach predicts@xcite that in two dimensions , fermi liquid quasiparticles disappear in the renormalized classical regime @xmath22 , which always precedes the zero - temperature phase transition in two - dimensions . in this regime the antiferromagnetic correlation length becomes larger than the single - particle thermal de broglie wave length @xmath23 leading to the destruction of fermi liquid quasiparticles with a concomitant appearance of precursors of antiferromagnetic bands ( `` shadow bands '' ) with no quasi - particle peak between them .",
    "we stress the crucial role of the classical thermal spin fluctuations and low dimensionality for the existence of this effect and contrast our results with the earlier results of kampf and schrieffer@xcite who used a susceptibility separable in momentum and frequency @xmath24 .",
    "the latter form of @xmath24 leads to an artifact that dispersive precursors of antiferromagnetic bands can exist at @xmath25 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "we also contrast our results with those obtained in the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) , which includes self - consistency in the single particle propagators but neglects the corresponding vertex corrections .",
    "the latter approach predicts only the so - called `` shadow feature '' @xcite which is an enhancement in the incoherent background of the spectral function due to antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "however , it does not predict@xcite the existence of `` shadow bands '' in the renormalized classical regime .",
    "these bands occur when the condition @xmath26 is satisfied .",
    "flex also predicts no pseudogap in the spectral function @xmath27 at half - filling @xcite . by analyzing temperature and size dependence of the monte carlo data and comparing them with the theoretical calculations",
    ", we argue that the monte carlo data supports our conclusion that the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands and the pseudogap do appear in the renormalized classical regime .",
    "we believe that the reason for which the flex approximation fails to reproduce this effect is essentially the same reason for which it fails to reproduce hubbard bands in the strong coupling limit . more specifically , the failure is due to an inconsistent treatment of vertex corrections in the self - energy _",
    "ansatz_. contrary to the electron - phonon case , these vertex corrections have a strong tendency to cancel the effects of using dressed propagators in the expression for the self - energy .",
    "recently , there have been very exciting developments in photoemission studies of the high-@xmath28 materials@xcite that show the opening of the pseudogap in single particle spectra above the superconducting phase transition . at present",
    ", there is an intense debate about the physical origin of this phenomena and , in particular , whether it is of magnetic or of pairing origin . from the theoretical point of view",
    "there are a lot of formal similarities in the description of antiferromagnetism in repulsive models and superconductivity in attractive models . in sec.([secdestruction ] ) we use this formal analogy to obtain a simple analytical expressions for the self - energy in the regime dominated by critical pairing fluctuations .",
    "we then point out on the similarities and differences in the spectral function in the case of magnetic and pairing pseudogaps .",
    "our approach has been described in simple physical terms in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the plan of the present paper is as follows . after recalling the model and the notation",
    ", we present our theory in sec.([secformal ] ) .",
    "there we point out which exact requirements of many - body theory are satisfied , and which are violated . before sec.([secformal ] ) , the reader is urged to read appendix  ( [ secsumrules ] ) that contains a summary of sum rules , conservation laws and other exact constraints .",
    "although this discussion contains many original results , it is not in the main text since the more expert reader can refer to the appendix as need be .",
    "we also illustrate in this appendix how an inconsistent treatment of the self - energy and vertex corrections can lead to the violation of a number of sum rules and inhibit the appearance of the hubbard bands , a subject also treated in sec.([secflex ] ) .",
    "section ( [ secmontecarlo ] ) compares the results of our approach and of other approaches to monte carlo simulations .",
    "we study in more details in sec.([secdestruction ] ) the renormalized classical regime at half - filling where , in two dimensions , fermi liquid quasiparticles are destroyed and replaced by precursors of antiferromagnetic bands well before the @xmath25 phase transition .",
    "we also consider in this section the analogous phenomenon of pairing pseudogap which can appear in two dimensions when the pairing fluctuations become critical .",
    "the following section sec.([secflex ] ) explains other attempts to obtain precursors of antiferromagnetic bands and points out why approaches such as flex fail to see the effect .",
    "we conclude in sec.([secvalidity ] ) with a discussion of the domain of validity of our approach and in sec.([seccomparisons ] ) with a critical comparison with flex and pseudo - potential parquet approaches , listing the weaknesses and strengths of our approach compared with these .",
    "a more systematic description and critique of various many - body approaches , as well as proofs of some of our results , appear in appendices .",
    "we first present the model and various definitions .",
    "the hubbard model is given by the hamiltonian , @xmath29 in this expression , the operator @xmath30 destroys an electron of spin @xmath31 at site @xmath32 .",
    "its adjoint @xmath33 creates an electron and the number operator is defined by @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "the symmetric hopping matrix @xmath36 determines the band structure , which here can be arbitrary .",
    "double occupation of a site costs an energy @xmath4 due to the screened coulomb interaction .",
    "we work in units where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the lattice spacing is also unity , @xmath39 . as an example that occurs later",

    "for example , the definition of the single - particle green s function can be written as @xmath44 where the brackets @xmath45 represent a thermal average in the grand canonical ensemble , @xmath46 is the time - ordering operator , and @xmath47 is imaginary time . in zero external field and in the absence of the symmetry breaking @xmath48 and",
    "the fourier - matsubara transforms of the green s function are    @xmath49    @xmath50    as usual , experimentally observable retarded quantities are obtained from the matsubara ones by analytical continuation @xmath51 in particular , the single - particle spectral weight @xmath52 is related to the single - particle propagator by @xmath53 @xmath54 the self - energy obeys dyson s equation , leading to @xmath55 it is convenient to use the following notation for real and imaginary parts of the analytically continued retarded self - energy @xmath56 causality and positivity of the spectral weight imply that @xmath57    finally , let us point out that for nearest - neighbor hopping , the hamiltonian is particle - hole symmetric at half - filling , @xmath58 with @xmath59 implying that @xmath60 and that , @xmath61 @xmath62 = -\\left [ \\sigma \\left ( { \\bf k+q},-ik_n\\right ) -\\frac u2\\right ] .",

    "let the charge and @xmath63 components of the spin operators at site @xmath32 be given respectively by @xmath64 @xmath65 the time evolution here is again that of the heisenberg representation in imaginary time .",
    "the charge and spin susceptibilities in imaginary time are the responses to perturbations applied in imaginary - time .",
    "for example , the linear response of the spin to an external field that couples linearly to the @xmath63 component @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 in an analogous manner , for charge we have @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the filling so that the disconnected piece is denoted @xmath70 .",
    "it is well known that when analytically continued , these susceptibilities give physical retarded and advanced response functions .",
    "in fact , the above two expressions are the imaginary - time version of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",

    "the high - frequency expansion has @xmath77 as a leading term so that there is no discontinuity in @xmath78as @xmath79 contrary to the single - particle case .",
    "to understand how to satisfy as well as possible the requirements imposed on many - body theory by exact results , such as those in appendix ( [ secsumrules ] ) , it is necessary to start from a general non - perturbative formulation of the many - body problem .",
    "we thus first present a general approach to many - body theory that is set in the framework introduced by martin and schwinger@xcite , luttinger and ward@xcite and kadanoff and baym@xcite@xcite .",
    "this allows one to see clearly the structure of the general theory expressed in terms of the one - particle irreducible self - energy and of the particle - hole irreducible vertices .",
    "these quantities represent projected propagators and there is a great advantage in doing approximations for these quantities rather than directly on propagators .    our own approximation to the hubbard model",

    "the physical meaning of eq .",
    "( [ usp ] ) is that the effective interaction in the most singular spin channel , is reduced by the probability of having two electrons with the opposite spins on the same site .",
    "consequently , the _ ansatz _ reproduces the kanamori - brueckner screening that inhibits ferromagnetism in the weak to intermediate coupling regime ( see also below ) .",

    "the plausible derivation of this _ ansatz _ can be found in refs.@xcite , @xcite as well as , in the present notation , in appendix ( [ ansatz ] ) .",

    "there is thus negative feedback in this equation that will make the self - consistent solution finite .",
    "a more direct proof by contradiction has been given in ref.@xcite : suppose that there is a phase transition , in other words suppose that @xmath129 then the zero - matsubara frequency contribution to the right - hand side of eq.([spin2 ] ) becomes infinite and positive in two dimensions as one can see from phase - space arguments ( see eq.([integlorentz = c ] ) ) .",

    "this is so both because of the finite temperature and because the wave vectors closest to the fermi surface are actually quite far on the appropriate scale .",
    "for this filling , the value of @xmath253 is fixed to @xmath254 on the fermi surface itself .",
    "it is thus necessary to find a dynamical quantity defined on the fermi surface whose temperature dependence will allow us to unambiguously identify the pseudogap regime in both theory and in monte carlo data .",

    "at zero temperature and small filling , the system is a paramagnetic fermi liquid , whatever the value of the interaction @xmath4 @xmath272 .",
    "then , as one moves closer to half - filling , one hits a quantum critical point at a value of filling @xmath273 .",

    "starting from finite - temperature then , the existence of long - range order at low temperature is signaled by the existence of a crossover temperature @xmath279 below which correlations start to grow exponentially .",

    "note that the above phase diagram is quite different from the predictions of hartree - fock theory mostly because of the strong renormalization of @xmath6 .",

    "it would be difficult to imagine how one could modify the theory in such a way that the growth of magnetic fluctuations does not occur even at incommensurate wave vectors . also , such an approach would also need to stop the growth of fluctuations that we find as we approach the quantum critical point along the zero temperature axis , from the low - filling , paramagnetic side , where @xmath283",
    ".    it could be that monte carlo simulations@xcite fail to see long - range order at zero temperature away from half - filling because at zero temperature , in the nearest - neighbor model , this order has a tendency to being incommensurate everywhere except at @xmath282 .",
    "furthermore , as we saw above , this incommensuration is in general far from one of the available wave vectors on an @xmath230 lattice .",
    "it comes close to @xmath284 only for the largest values of @xmath4 available by monte carlo .",
    "hence , incommensurate order on small lattices is violently frustrated not only by the boundary conditions , but also by the fact that there is no wave vector on what would be the fermi surface of the infinite system .",
    "this means that the electron - electron interaction scatters the electrons at wave - vectors that are not those where the instability would show up , rendering these scatterings not singular .",
    "this is clearly an open problem .",

    "this is particularly important here because size effects and statistical errors make numerical continuation of the monte carlo data to real frequencies particularly difficult .",
    "such analytic continuations using the maximum entropy method@xcite have , in the past , lead to a conclusion different from the one obtained later using singular value decomposition@xcite .    in this section then , we will consider the conditions for which fermi liquid quasiparticles can be destroyed and replaced by a pseudogap in two dimensions .",
    "the major part of this section will be concerned with the single particle pseudogap and the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands in the vicinity of the zero temperature antiferromagnetic phase transition in the positive @xmath4 hubbard model .",
    "however , it is well known that the problem of superconductivity is formally related to the problem of antiferromagnetism , in particular at half - filling where the nearest - neighbor hopping positive @xmath4 hubbard model maps exactly onto the nearest - neighbor negative @xmath4 hubbard model .",
    "the corresponding canonical transformation maps the @xmath286 spin correlations of the repulsive model onto the @xmath287 pairing and @xmath288 charge correlations of the attractive model while the single - particle green s functions of both models are identical .",
    "thus all our results below concerning the opening of the pseudogap in @xmath289 in the repulsive @xmath4 half - filled hubbard model are directly applicable to the attractive @xmath4 model at half - filling , the only difference being in the physical interpretation . while in the case of repulsive interaction the pseudogap is due to the critical thermal spin fluctuation , in the case of attractive interactions it is , obviously , due to the critical thermal pairing and charge fluctuations .",
    "away from half - filling the mapping between two models is more complicated and the single particle spectra in the pairing pseudogap regime @xmath289 have important qualitative differences with the single particle spectra in the magnetic pseudogap regime .",
    "however , even in this case there are very useful formal similarities between two problems so that in subsec.([pairing ] ) we will give some simple analytical results for the self - energy in the regime dominated by critical pairing fluctuations .",
    "the problem of precursor effects in the repulsive hubbard model has been first studied by kampf and schrieffer@xcite .",
    "their analysis however was done at zero temperature and although the precursor effect that they found , called `` shadow bands '' , looks similar to what we find , there are a number of important differences .",
    "for example , they find a quasiparticle between the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands , while we do not .",
    "also , one does not obtain precursors at _ zero _ temperature when one uses our more standard expression for the dynamical susceptibility instead of the phenomenological form @xmath290 that they use .",
    "the physical reason why a function that is separable in both momentum and frequency , such as @xmath291 , leads to qualitatively different results than the conventional one has been explained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the microscopic justification for @xmath291 is unclear .",
    "we comment below on this problem as well as on some of the large related literature that has appeared lately .    repeating some of the arguments of ref.@xcite , we first show by general phase space arguments that the feedback of antiferromagnetic fluctuations on quasiparticles has the potential of being strong enough to destroy the fermi liquid only in low enough dimension , the upper critical dimension being three .",
    "then we go into more detailed analysis to give explicit analytic expressions for the quasi - singular part of the self - energy , first in matsubara frequency .",
    "the analysis of the self - energy expression directly in real - frequencies is in appendix  ( [ apprealfrequ ] ) .",
    "the latter analysis is useful to exhibit in the same formalism both the fermi liquid limit and the non - fermi liquid limit .    for simplicity",
    "we give asymptotics for @xmath282 at the fermi wave vector , where @xmath292 , but similar results apply for @xmath293 as long as there is long - range order at @xmath25 and one is below @xmath132 .",
    "this case is also discussed briefly , but for more details the reader is referred to ref.@xcite .      before describing the effect of spin fluctuations on quasiparticles , we first describe the so - called renormalized classical regime of spin fluctuations that precedes the zero - temperature phase transition in two dimensions .",
    "the spin susceptibility @xmath294 below @xmath132 is almost singular at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath295 because the energy scale @xmath296 ( @xmath297 ) associated with the proximity to the sdw instability becomes exponentially small.@xcite this small energy scale , @xmath298 , leads to the so - called renormalized classical regime for the fluctuations.@xcite in this regime , the main contribution to the sum over matsubara frequencies entering the local - moment sum rule eq.([spin ] ) comes from @xmath299 and wave vectors @xmath300 near @xmath301 . approximating @xmath302 by its asymptotic form @xmath303 where @xmath304 , @xmath305 and @xmath306 we obtain , in @xmath40 dimensions    @xmath307    where @xmath308 is the left - hand side of eq.([spin ] ) minus corrections @xmath309",
    "that come from the sum over non - zero matsubara frequencies ( quantum effects ) and from @xmath310 .",
    "there is an upper cutoff to the integral which is less than or of the order of the brillouin zone size .",
    "the important point is that the left - hand side of the above equation eq.([ksi1 ] ) is bounded and weakly dependent on temperature .",
    "this implies , as discussed in detail in ref.@xcite , that the above equation leads to critical exponents for the correlation length that are in the spherical model ( @xmath311 universality class .",
    "for our purposes , it suffices to notice that the integral converges even when @xmath312 in more than two dimensions .",
    "this leads to a finite transition temperature . in two dimensions ,",
    "the transition temperature is pushed down to zero temperature and , doing the integral , one is left with a correlation length @xmath313 that grows exponentially below @xmath132@xmath314",
    "the important consequence of this is that , below @xmath132 , the correlation length quickly becomes larger than the single - particle thermal de broglie wave length @xmath315 .",
    "this has dramatic consequences on quasiparticles in two dimensions .",
    "when the classical fluctuations ( @xmath316 ) become critical , they also give , in two dimensions , a dominant contribution to the self - energy _ at low frequency_. to illustrate what we mean by the classical frequency contribution , neglect the contribution of charge fluctuations and single out the zero matsubara frequency component from eq.([param ] ) to obtain @xmath317 @xmath318 here , @xmath319 is measured relative to the chemical potential .",

    "hence the contribution of classical fluctuations to the retarded self - energy @xmath325 can obtained from the @xmath316 term by trivial analytical continuation @xmath326 note also that the chemical potential entering @xmath16 in the self - energy formula is @xmath327 at half - filling .",

    "three dimensions then is the upper critical dimension . as usual , logarithmic corrections exist at the upper critical dimension . the effect will be very small in three dimensions not only because it is logarithmic , but also because the fluctuation regime is very small , extending only in a narrow temperature range around the nel temperature .",
    "by contrast , in two dimensions the effect extends all the way from the crossover temperature , @xmath132 , which is of the order of the mean - field transition temperature , to zero temperature where the transition is .",
    "wave vectors near van hove singularities are even more sensitive to classical thermal fluctuations .",

    "the positions of the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands scale like @xmath394 which itself , at small coupling in two dimensions , scales like the mean field sdw transition temperature or gap ( see appendix b of ref.@xcite ) . as @xmath4 increases , the predicted positions of the maxima obtained from the asymptotic form eq.([spectralweight ] )",
    "will be less accurate since they will be at intermediate frequencies and the regular quantum contribution to the self - energy will affect more and more the position of the peaks .",
    "we have predicted@xcite that the exponential growth of the magnetic correlation length @xmath338 below @xmath132 will be accompanied by the appearance of precursors of sdw bands in @xmath289 with no quasiparticle peak between them .",

    "a clear illustration of this is when a four peak structure exists in the spectral function @xmath397 two peaks being precursors of antiferromagnetic bands , and two peaks being upper and lower hubbard bands .",
    "the main differences between these bands are in the @xmath360_@xmath398dependence _ of the self - energy @xmath399 and in the conditions for which these bands develop .",

    "in contrast , the upper critical dimension for the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands is three ( see sec.([subsecabsin3d ] ) ) .    in our theory",

    ", the same will not be true for the location of the upper and lower hubbard bands .",
    "this is because our theory is tuned to the low frequency behavior of the irreducible vertices and does not have the right numerical coefficient in the high - frequency expansion of the self - energy , as shown in eq.([og ] ) below .",

    "hence , precursors of antiferromagnetic bands that appear in the paramagnetic state do so with a finite pseudogap which appears consistent with the finite zero - temperature gap towards which the system is evolving .",

    "one expects then that a pseudogap will also open in this case when the correlation length for pairing fluctuations becomes larger than the single - particle thermal de broglie wavelength @xmath430 .",
    "this should occur below the crossover temperature to the renormalized classical regime of pairing fluctuations but above the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature .",

    "in particular , one would have to take into account corrections to the simple form that we used for the pairing susceptibility @xmath466 this lorentzian form of the susceptibility in the critical regime is strictly valid only in the @xmath467 limit ( @xmath194 is the number of the components of the order parameter ) and is , clearly , a less accurate approximation in the case of pairing fluctuations @xmath468 than in the case of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations @xmath469 .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that qualitatively the picture given above is correct for two reasons . first , because in the kosterlitz - thouless picture the magnitude of the order parameter is locally non - zero starting below a crossover temperature @xmath367 that is larger than the transition temperature @xmath470 .",
    "it is only the phase that is globally decorrelated above @xmath470 .",
    "this means that locally the quasiparticles are basically in a superconducting state even above @xmath471 a second reason to believe in the precursor effects is that the superfluid density and the gap are _ finite _ as @xmath472 and , hence , the two peak structure in @xmath473 exists even as the phase transition point is approached from the low - temperature side . by analogy with the antiferromagnetic case ,",
    "this two peak structure should not immediately disappear when one increases the temperature slightly above @xmath470 .",
    "finally , we point out that the precursor phenomenon described above has to be distinguished from , so - called , pre - formed pairs considered first by p. nozires and s. schmitt - rink@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these pre - formed pairs exist in any dimension when the coupling strength is sufficiently large , while the precursor effect considered above can be caused by arbitrarily small attractive interactions but only in two dimensions .",
    "we think that recent monte carlo data on the negative @xmath474 hubbard model illustrates the opening of the single - particle pseudogap due to critical fluctuations , rather than a strong - coupling effect . in these simulations ,",
    "the drop in the density of states at the fermi level should be accompanied by a simultaneous rapid increase of the pairing structure factor @xmath475 .",
    "the latter must be exponential in the infinite 2d lattice and a size analysis of monte carlo data similar to the one shown on fig.([figjoint ] ) would be extremely helpful to clarify this issue .",
    "in this section , we explain why the theories that use self - consistent propagators but neglect the corresponding frequency - dependent vertex corrections _",
    "fail _ to see two important physical effects : namely upper and lower hubbard bands , as well as the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands that we just discussed .",
    "the failure of this type of self - consistent schemes to correctly predict upper and lower hubbard bands has been realized a long time ago in the context of calculations in infinite dimension@xcite@xcite .",
    "while one may brush aside this failure by claiming that high - energy phenomena are not so relevant to low - energy physics , we show that in fact these schemes also fail to reproduce the _ low - energy _ pseudogap and the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands for essentially the same reasons that they fail to see hubbard bands .",
    "it is thus useful to start by a discussion of the better understood phenomenon of upper and lower hubbard bands and then to move to precursors of antiferromagnetic bands .",
    "we first note that ordinary perturbation theory satisfies the correct high - frequency behavior eq.([selfhaut ] ) for the self - energy namely , for @xmath476@xmath477 it is the latter property that guarantees the existence of the hubbard bands for @xmath400 . to see this , consider the half - filled case . in this case",
    ", @xmath478 , @xmath60 and one finds for the spectral weight @xmath479 which has pronounced maxima at the upper and lower hubbard bands , namely @xmath480has long as @xmath481is not too large .",
    "since these results are obtained using high - frequency asymptotics , they are valid only when the asymptotic eq.([selfhaut ] ) has already set in when @xmath482 in the exact theory and in ordinary perturbation theory in terms of _ bare _ green functions @xmath12 , eq.([selfhaut ] ) is valid for @xmath483and the hubbard bands appears as soon as @xmath4become larger than @xmath484 .    the fact that this simple high - frequency behavior sets in at the energy scale given by @xmath484rather than @xmath4 , even when @xmath485 , is a non - trivial consequence of the pauli principle .",
    "to see this we first recall the exact result for the self - energy @xmath486 in the atomic limit@xcite @xmath487 formally , the atomic limit means that hopping is the smallest of all energy scales in the problem , including the temperature , @xmath488 , which is not a very interesting case .",
    "however , the same arguments that have been used to derive the expression ( [ exact ] ) in the atomic limit can be used to show that eq.([exact ] ) is valid at any @xmath489when @xmath490 .",
    "indeed , in the equations of motion for two - particle correlators@xcite one can neglect hopping terms when @xmath490 .",
    "this is where the asymptotic behavior ( [ exact ] ) sets in since the equations of motion then immediately lend themselves to a solution without any additional approximation for the interacting term .",
    "this solution is possible because the pauli principle @xmath491allows us to collapse three - particle correlation function which enters equation of motion to the two - particle one @xmath492 .",
    "hence , the expression for atomic limit eq.([exact ] ) is also a general result for the self - energy that is valid for @xmath493at half - filling @xmath478 , @xmath60and the asymptotic ( [ selfhaut ] ) sets in at @xmath494 , as was pointed out above .",
    "away from half - filling , as long as @xmath495and @xmath496are both much smaller than @xmath497(they both vanish at half - filling ) , the asymptotic behavior will also start at @xmath498 .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different when one uses dressed green functions , but does not take into account the frequency dependence of the vertex , as it is done in flex ( see eq.[berksfl ] ) ) or for second - order perturbation theory with dressed @xmath88 .",
    "for example , the second - order expression for @xmath486 in terms of full @xmath499does satisfy the asymptotics eq.([selfhaut ] ) , but it sets in too late , namely for @xmath500 , instead of @xmath490 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath490 , the equation for the self - energy at half - filling in this type of theories reduces to @xmath501 where @xmath502with @xmath503a constant of proportionality involving the sum over all wave vectors and matsubara frequencies of the self - consistent dynamical susceptibilities . in a given theory",
    "the value of @xmath503 may differ from its value @xmath504obtained from the exact result eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) , but its always of order unity .",
    "the solution of eq.([assigflex ] ) @xmath505 has the analytically continued form @xmath506 @xmath507 from this one can immediately see that a @xmath153regime exists for re@xmath508only when @xmath509@xmath510 .",
    "this means that such regime sets in too late to give the hubbard bands described by eq.([hlhubbard ] ) , because the hubbard bands occur at @xmath511 and for such @xmath512the asymptotic form @xmath513is not valid yet in flex and similar theories .",
    "consequently , instead of well defined peaks at @xmath514 in the half - filled case , one obtains only long tails in the spectral function @xmath515 no matter how large @xmath4 is.@xcite(see also following subsection ) .",
    "this explains why there is no hubbard bands in any theory that uses self - consistent green s functions , but neglects the frequency dependence of the vertex .",
    "this is an explicit example that illustrates what seems to be a more general phenomenon when there is no migdal theorem for vertex corrections : a calculation with dressed green s functions but no frequency dependent vertex correction often gives worse results than a calculation done with bare green s functions and a frequency independent vertex .      in this subsection",
    "we describe the qualitative differences between our results and the results of flex approximations given by eq.([berksfl ] ) with regards to the `` shadow bands '' and explain why we believe that the failure of the flex to reproduce these bands is an artifact of that approximation . to avoid any confusion , we first clarify the terminology , because the term `` shadow bands '' has been used previously to describe different physical effects .",
    "( see for details ref .",
    "we note that the so - called shadow features discussed in @xcite , @xcite as well as the pseudogap in the _ total _ density of states @xmath516exist in both theories and we will not discuss them here . instead , we concentrate on the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands in the spectral function @xmath257which correspond to two new solutions of the quasi - particle equation @xmath517    we start by recalling a simple physical argument why the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands must exist at finite temperatures in the vicinity of the zero - temperature phase transition in two dimensions . this can be best understood by contrasting this case with isotropic 3d case where such precursor effect are highly unlikely .",
    "( for a discussion of the strongly anisotropic case see sec.([subsecabsin3d ] ) ) .",

    "we again consider half - filling .",
    "as we have seen in section ( [ subsecprecursors ] ) two new quasi - particle peaks do appear in the renormalized classical regime @xmath365 in our theory .",
    "we have also found a pseudogap with the minimum at @xmath259 in this regime .",

    "with decreasing temperature this central maximum becomes anomalously broad , but the two peak structure does not appear .",
    "the clear deviation from the fermi liquid is signaled by the positive sign of @xmath521 .",
    "however the value of @xmath522does not become larger than unity .",
    "the latter would unavoidably lead to the existence of two new quasi - particle peaks away from @xmath259as is clear from the graphical solution of the quasiparticle equation eq.([qpeq ] ) shown on the bottom left panel of figs.([akom ] ) .",
    "we now explain analytically the origin of these qualitative differences in the two theories . in our theory",
    "@xmath523and hence it quickly becomes larger than unity in the renormalized classical regime @xmath524 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath525the real part of the self - energy has the same behavior as in the ordered state @xmath526with @xmath527 .",
    "the important point is that this asymptotic behavior @xmath526of the self - energy already sets in for @xmath528 .",
    "it is this property that leads to the appearance of the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands at @xmath529 in a manner analogous to the appearance of the hubbard bands in the strong coupling limit that is discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "let s now try to understand analytically what happens in the flex approximation .",
    "as in our theory , the main contribution to the self - energy in the strongly fluctuating regime comes from the zero - frequency term in the matsubara sum in the equation for the self - energy ( eq.([classicalcontribution ] ) in our theory and eq.([berksfl ] ) in flex ) .",
    "an upper bound of the effect of the critical spin fluctuations can be obtained by approximating @xmath530 .",

    ", the slope of @xmath534 at @xmath535 does not diverge with decreasing temperature as in our theory but instead saturates to its value given by the analog of eq.([sigmaflexreal ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath536 . as we mentioned above , a value larger than unity",
    "@xmath537 would guarantee the existence of two new solutions of the quasiparticle equation eq.([qpeq ] ) away from @xmath259 .",
    "the right - hand side of fig.([akom ] ) illustrates clearly what happens in a flex - like approach such as eq.([assigflex ] ) . the contribution of classical fluctuations to the spectral weight does not lead to a fermi liquid since @xmath263 saturates to a finite width as temperature decreases , but nevertheless precursors of shadow bands do not occur because @xmath538 is bounded below unity .",
    "( note that the spectral weight would not vanish so steeply at large frequencies if we had taken into account the quantum contribution of the spin fluctuations , as in full flex calculations . )",
    "we just saw that the self - consistency in the propagators without corresponding self - consistency in the vertices inhibits the existence of the shadow bands in essentially the same way as it inhibits the existence of the hubbard bands .",
    "it thus seems to us very likely that the absence of the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands below @xmath132 in flex is an artifact .",

    "does this scheme lead to a calculation of the `` true '' susceptibilities@xcite and of collective modes that satisfy conservation laws ( ward identities ) .",
    "however , these `` true '' susceptibilities are never substituted back in the calculation of the self - energy and the effect of `` true '' collective modes on the single - particle spectrum is an open question in flex .",
    "in fact , the rpa propagators @xmath544 appearing in the self - energy expression are different from susceptibilities from which collective modes should be computed and further they explicitly break conservation laws , as can be seen from the fact that rpa - like expressions @xmath545 with a _ dressed _",
    "bubble @xmath215 have the unphysical properties that are mentioned in eqs.([wardtriste ] ) and ( [ ftriste ] ) of appendix ( [ secsumrules ] ) .",
    "the fact that there are in effect two susceptibilities in the flex approximation leads , in our opinion , to some confusion and incorrect physical interpretation of the results in the literature .",
    "in particular , it was argued that the non - fermi - liquid behavior and deviations from luttinger theorem found in flex @xcite are not due to critical thermal fluctuation in the vicinity of the phase transition but are rather the result of large @xmath4 .",
    "the reasoning for such claim was that although the rpa susceptibilities @xmath546 is very strongly peaked at @xmath520 , the `` true '' flex susceptibility is not . in our opinion",

    "the fact that the flex `` true '' susceptibility does not show such behavior at half - filling@xcite tells us that it even more drastically disagrees with the monte carlo data than the rpa - like @xmath552 which enters the expression for self - energy . moreover , even away from half - filling the `` true '' susceptibility in flex at @xmath520 significantly underestimates the strength of the spin fluctuations , as is clear from the comparison with monte carlo data in fig.([figchit ] ) . in our opinion",
    "the , so - called , `` true susceptibility '' in flex is the key element in the confusion surrounding the interpretation of flex results for the self - energy because the `` true susceptibility '' never comes in the calculation of the self - energy . for all practical purposes",
    "these calculations of the self - energy should be considered as consistent with luttinger s theorem at @xmath553 but based on a non - conserving susceptibility .",
    "consistency with conservation laws and consistency with luttinger s theorem are not identical requirements because to satisfy rigorously luttinger s theorem one needs that @xmath543 , while to have conserving susceptibilities one needs that the irreducible vertices used in bethe - salpeter equation eq.([1a ] ) should be obtained from @xmath554 .",
    "our approach is not valid beyond intermediate coupling .",
    "that is perhaps best illustrated by fig.([figtxu ] ) that shows that the crossover temperature first increases with @xmath4 and then saturates instead of decreasing .",

    "it is necessary to include at least a frequency dependence to the self - energy and to the corresponding irreducible vertices .",
    "our theory also fails at half - filling deep in the renormalized classical regime , i.e. @xmath556 mainly for two reasons .",
    "first , the _ ansatz _ @xmath557 , eq.([usp ] ) , fails in the sense that @xmath558 eventually reaches zero at @xmath559 because of the @xmath560 divergence in the irreducible susceptibility @xmath561 due to perfect nesting .",
    "the physically appropriate choice for @xmath558 in the renormalized classical regime is to keep its value fixed to its crossover - temperature value ( see fig.([figgupdown ] ) and sec.([secmontecarlo ] ) ) .",
    "the more serious reason why our approach fails for @xmath556 is that , as we just saw , critical fluctuations destroy completely the fermi liquid quasiparticles and lead to a pseudogap .",
    "this invalidates our starting point .",
    "it is likely that in a more self - consistent theory , the logarithmic divergence of the appropriate irreducible susceptibility will be cutoff by the pseudogap .",
    "however , just a simple dressing of the green s function is not the correct solution to the problem because it would make the theory non - conserving , as we discussed in sec.([secconsttwopart ] ) .",
    "one needs to take into account wave vector and energy dependent vertex corrections similar to those discussed by schrieffer@xcite@xcite .",

    "vertex corrections are included not only in spin and charge susceptibilities @xmath570 but also in the self - energy formula . in the latter case , this takes into account the fact that there is no migdal theorem controlling the effect of spin and charge fluctuations on the self - energy .",

    "this will , of course , require solving much more complicated self - consistent equations than in the present approach , but we believe that the problem still can be made tractable .    finally , we would like to make two comments about the magnetic and the pairing pseudogap in the context of high-@xmath28 superconductors , based on the results of our studies .",
    "first , as was stressed in ref.@xcite , to understand clearly the physics of the single - particle pseudogap phenomena it is important to distinguish _",
    "static _ short - range order from _ dynamical _ short - range order .",
    "the former is defined by a nearly lorentzian form of the corresponding static structure factor @xmath574 ( @xmath438 in magnetic case , @xmath575 in the case of pairing ) , while the latter means only that the corresponding susceptibility @xmath576 has such a lorentzian form .",
    "a condition for the existence of the single particle pseudogap in the vicinity of a given phase transition is that the corresponding short - range order is quasi - static ( _ i.e._@xmath577)@xcite .",
    "experimentally , one can measure directly the dynamical spin structure factor @xmath578 , and then obtain the static structure factor through the integral @xmath579 .",
    "even if the zero - frequency dynamical structure factor @xmath580 is very strongly peaked at @xmath581 it is possible that the static structure factor @xmath582 is only weakly momentum dependent@xcite .",
    "thus in order to know whether one should expect to see the precursors of the antiferromagnetic bands and the corresponding pseudogap at a given doping and temperature it is necessary to obtain the _",
    "static _ spin structure factor from the experimentally determined dynamical structure factor and then analyze its momentum dependence to see both if it is peaked and if it is quasi - two - dimensional .",
    "the second comment that we would like to make is that both the pairing and the magnetic single - particle pseudogap discussed above are an effect of low dimensionality and hence they exist as long as there is a large two - dimensional fluctuating regime before the real three - dimensional phase transition . in this context",
    ", a pairing pseudogap could exist on either side of optimal doping.@xcite the much larger temperature range over which a pseudogap appears in the underdoped compounds suggests that , in addition to pairing fluctuations , other thermal fluctuations ( charge , spin ... ) prohibit finite - temperature ordering.@xcite an example of this occurs in the attractive hubbard model where charge fluctuations push the kosterlitz - thouless temperature to zero at half - filling , precisely where the crossover temperature to the pseudogap regime is largest .",

    "they are all consequences of either anticommutation relations alone ( pauli principle ) or of anticommutation relations and the heisenberg equations of motion .",

    "sum rules for one - particle properties ; 3 . sum rules and constraints on two - particle properties , in particular _",
    "f_-sum rule and ward identities that express conservation laws ; 4 . a few relations that are crucial in fermi liquid theory , namely luttinger s theorem and the forward scattering sum rule .",
    "the self - energy ( we always mean one - particle irreducible self - energy ) is related to the potential energy , and hence to two - particle correlations through the expression eq.([consistency ] ) , which in the kadanoff and baym notation can be written as @xmath583 here , the index with an overbar , @xmath584 means that there is a sum over corresponding lattice positions and an integral over imaginary time .",
    "the notation @xmath585 means that the imaginary time implicit in @xmath586 is @xmath587 where @xmath588 is a positive infinitesimal number .",
    "eq.([consistency1 ] ) is an important consistency requirement between self - energy and double occupancy in the hubbard model that can easily be proven as follows . from the equations of motion for the single - particle green s function eq.([defg ] ) one finds , @xmath589 g_\\sigma \\left ( { \\bf r}_\\ell -{\\bf r}_j,\\tau _ i-\\tau _ j\\right)\\ ] ] @xmath590 using the short - hand notation in eqs.([defg ] ) and ( [ gfur ] ) and the definition of self - energy ( dyson s equation ) the above equation is also written in the form , @xmath591 comparing the last two equations , the well known relation eq.([consistency1 ] ) ( or eq.([consistency ] ) ) between self - energy , green s function and potential energy follows .",

    "the right - hand side can be computed from the collective modes using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . in conserving approximations , this gives a result that is different from what is computed directly from the left - hand side of the equation , namely from the self - energy and from the green s function .",

    "the spectral weight @xmath592 can be interpreted as a probability of having an electron in a state @xmath593 and it satisfies the normalization sum rule @xmath594 formally this is a consequence of the jump in the green s function at @xmath595 , as can be seen from calculating @xmath596    to do perturbation theory directly for the green s function to any _ finite",
    "_ order would require that the interaction @xmath4 be small not only in comparison with the bandwidth @xmath484 but also in comparison with the smallest matsubara frequency @xmath597 .",
    "also , the direct perturbation series for the green s function gives , after analytical continuation , poles of arbitrary high order located at the unperturbed energies .",
    "these high - order poles are inconsistent with the simple pole ( or branch cut ) structure of the green s function predicted by the spectral representation .",
    "furthermore , the high - order poles lead to a spectral weight that can be negative.@xcite the common way to get around these difficulties is to make approximations for the self - energy @xmath164 instead and then calculate the green s function using dyson s equation eq.([gself ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that to satisfy the constraint eq.([a1 ] ) , it suffices that @xmath598 , defined by eq.([gself ] ) , has a finite limit as @xmath599 more constraints on approximations for the self - energy may be found by continuing this line of thought .",
    "a systematic way of doing this is to do a high - frequency expansion for both the matsubara green s function and the self - energy and to find coefficients using sum - rules .",
    "the sum - rules that we need then are@xcite @xmath600 , c_{{\\bf k}\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } \\right\\ } \\right\\rangle = \\epsilon _ { { \\bf k}}-\\mu + un_{-\\sigma }   \\label{a2}\\ ] ] @xmath601 where @xmath602 since we are in the paramagnetic state .    using the spectral representation eq.([spectralg ] ) one can easily see that the above sum rules give the coefficients of the high - frequency expansion of the matsubara green s function @xmath603 the self - energy has the same analytic properties as the green s function . using its high frequency expansion in the expression for the green s function eq.([gself ] ) , one finds that the first term in eq.([highg ] ) , leads to the requirement that the self - energy has a finite limit at @xmath604 .",
    "the second term fixes the value of this constant to the hartree - fock result , and the last and second - term combine to give the leading term in @xmath605of the self - energy high - frequency expansion . in short ,",

    "however , it is important to realize that it is not a sufficient condition .",
    "indeed , the following paradox has been noticed in explicit calculations in infinite dimensions@xcite,@xcite . while ordinary second - order perturbation theory with _ bare _ green functions @xmath610reproduces correctly the appearance of the hubbard bands with increasing @xmath611 , the perturbation theory with dressed green function @xmath612^{-1}$ ] does not .",
    "the reason for this is that although the second - order expression for @xmath486 in terms of full @xmath88 does satisfy the asymptotics eq.([selfhaut2 ] ) , it sets in too late , namely for @xmath500 , instead of @xmath490 .",
    "the fact that the asymptotics should start at @xmath613 even when @xmath400 is a non - trivial consequence of the pauli principle , as explained in sec.([hubbardbands ] ) .",
    "thus there are no hubbard bands in any theory that uses self - consistent green functions but neglects the frequency dependence of the vertex .",
    "this is an explicit example that illustrates what seems to be a more general phenomena : a calculation with dressed green s functions but no frequency dependent vertex correction often gives worse results that the one done with bare green s functions and a frequency independent vertex .",
    "we will see in the next subsection that this also happens in the calculation of the two - particle properties .",
    "also , as we have argued in sec.([secflex ] ) , a similar situation occurs with the precursors of antiferromagnetic bands in the renormalized classical regime in two - dimensions .    finally , we quote two more well known sum - rules that we will need .",
    "they involve the fermi function @xmath614 and the spectral weight .",
    "the first one follows from definition of @xmath615 and the spectral representation @xmath616 the quantity @xmath617 is the distribution function .",
    "it is equal to the fermi function only when the self - energy is frequency independent .",
    "the next result , that follows simply from the equations of motion , @xmath618 is useful to show to what extent certain dressed - propagator approaches fail to satisfy the @xmath198sum rule .",
    "for any one - band model , independently of the hamiltonian , the pauli principle ( anticommutation relations ) @xmath619 implies the following two simple identities : @xmath620 the correlation functions on the left - hand side are equal - time and equal - position spin and charge correlation functions .",
    "the susceptibilities @xmath621 @xmath622 in eqs.([suscharge ] ) and ( [ susspin ] ) are response functions for arbitrary @xmath623 so they must reduce to the above equal - time equal - position correlation functions when @xmath624 and @xmath625 .",
    "this is one special case of the imaginary - time version of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem eqs.([susspin])([suscharge ] ) .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath631 to see this , notice that when the pauli principle is satisfied , our two sum rules eqs.([susspinsum ] ) and ( [ suschargesum ] ) lead to @xmath119 = 2n - n^2 .",

    "this quantity is positive and bounded by its value for @xmath635 and its value for non - interacting systems , namely @xmath636 .",
    "hence , the right - hand side of the local - moment sum - rule eq.([susspinsum ] ) is contained in the interval @xmath637 .$ ] any theory that prevents the right - hand side of the local - moment sum rule from taking infinite values satisfies the mermin - wagner theorem .    proof : : :    near a magnetic phase transition , the zero matsubara - frequency    component of the spin susceptibility takes the ornstein - zernicke form    @xmath638    where @xmath333 is measured with respect to the ordering wave    vector @xmath301 and where @xmath639 is the    square of the correlation length . near its maximum , the above    susceptibility is of order @xmath639 while all finite    matsubara - frequency components at the ordering wave vector are at most    of order @xmath640 which is much smaller    than @xmath639 .",
    "hence , one can keep only the zero - matsubara    frequency contribution on the left - hand side of the local - moment sum    rule eq.([susspinsum ] ) obtaining    @xmath641 where    @xmath127 contains non - zero matsubara frequency    contributions as well as    @xmath642    since @xmath643 is finite , this means that in two dimensions    @xmath644 , it is impossible to have @xmath645 on    the left - hand side otherwise the integral would diverge    logarithmically .",

    "the energies can not in general be taken out of the sum and interactions influence the value of the right - hand side , but only through the fact that @xmath617 differs from the non - interacting fermi function @xmath654 . at strong - coupling ,",
    "where the self - energy is strongly frequency dependent , this difference between @xmath617 and @xmath654 becomes important .",

    "the @xmath4 dependence of the @xmath198sum rule becomes important only close to half - filling and for @xmath655 , signaling the breakdown of approximations based on frequency - independent self - energies .",
    "while rpa - like theories that use @xmath654 instead of @xmath656 violate only weakly the @xmath198 sum rule in the weak to intermediate coupling regime , self - consistent theories that use frequency - dependent self - energies but no frequency - dependent vertices violate conservations laws in general , and the @xmath198 sum rule in particular , in a much more dramatic way .",
    "the point is that susceptibilities with a dressed bubble , @xmath657 are bad approximations because they have the following properties , for any value of @xmath4 @xmath658 @xmath659 the first of these equations explicitly violates the ward identity , eq.([ward ] ) below , at all frequencies , including small non - zero ones , since at zero wave vector we should have @xmath660 for _ all _ frequencies except zero .",
    "the second equation , eq.([ftriste ] ) violates the @xmath213-sum rule eq.([f2 ] ) at _ all wave _ vectors _ , _ by a constant term @xmath661 which in practical calculations , say at @xmath220 , is of the same order as the first term , which is the only one that should be there according to the @xmath213-sum rule .",

    "conservation laws have general consequences not only on equal - time correlation functions , as in the @xmath198sum rule above , but also on time - dependent correlation functions .",

    "furthermore , the pseudopotentials are determined by asking that the susceptibilities extracted from the four - point functions in the parquet equations match the corresponding rpa - pseudo - potential susceptibility at only one wave vector and frequency .",

    "contrary to most other approaches , our theory does satisfy the local pauli principle eq.([pauli ] ) exactly .",

    "<S> are included . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the theory is in quantitative agreement with monte carlo simulations for both single - particle and two - particle properties . </S>",
    "<S> the theory predicts a magnetic phase diagram where magnetic order persists away from half - filling but where ferromagnetism is completely suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> both quantum - critical and renormalized - classical behavior can occur in certain parameter ranges . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in the renormalized classical regime , spin fluctuations lead to precursors of antiferromagnetic bands ( shadow bands ) and to the destruction of the fermi - liquid quasiparticles in a wide temperature range above the zero - temperature phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the upper critical dimension for this phenomenon is three . </S>",
    "<S> the analogous phenomenon of pairing pseudogap can occur in the attractive model in two dimensions when the pairing fluctuations become critical . </S>",
    "<S> simple analytical expressions for the self - energy are derived in both the magnetic and pairing pseudogap regimes . </S>",
    "<S> other approaches , such as paramagnon , self - consistent fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) , and pseudo - potential parquet approaches are critically compared . in particular , it is argued that the failure of the flex approximation to reproduce the pseudogap and the precursors afm bands in the weak coupling regime and the hubbard bands in the strong coupling regime is due to inconsistent treatment of vertex corrections in the expression for the self - energy . treating the spin fluctuations as if there was a migdal s theorem can lead not only to quantitatively wrong results but also to qualitatively wrong predictions , in particular with regard to the the single - particle pseudogap . </S>"
