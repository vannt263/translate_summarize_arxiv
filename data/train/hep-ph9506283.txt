    "although inflation  @xcite is an attractive solution to the horizon / flatness problems of the standard big bang model and to the cosmological monopole problem of guts , it has yet to find a compelling physical basis  @xcite .",
    "interest in this question has been rekindled by the cobe  @xcite discovery of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) consistent with a ` harrison - zeldovich ' scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "this arises naturally in ` slow - roll ' inflationary models from quantum fluctuations of the scalar field which drives the de  sitter phase of exponential expansion , as it evolves towards its minimum  @xcite .",
    "the observed small amplitude , @xmath4 , requires an extremely flat scalar potential stabilized against radiative corrections .",
    "this picks out a gauge singlet field in a theory incorporating supersymmetry ( susy ) as the most likely candidate for the ` inflaton '  @xcite .",
    "however such models contain very weakly coupled fields having masses of @xmath5 and this creates difficulties with the cosmological history _ after _ inflation .",
    "for example , gravitinos can have observable effects on the standard cosmology since they decay very late with lifetime @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "although their primordial abundance can be inflated away , they are recreated during ` reheating ' as the inflaton oscillates about its minimum , converting vacuum energy into radiation  @xcite .",
    "this imposes a severe constraint on the reheat temperature since even a small number of massive late decaying particles can disrupt primordial nucleosynthesis or the thermalization of the cmb  @xcite .",
    "also inflation offers no obvious solution to the ` polonyi problem '  @xcite which is rather more subtle , being associated with the production of the unwanted states via vacuum decay in sectors whose vacuum energy is affected through gravitational interactions by the vacuum energy driving inflation .",
    "this is of particular relevance to the moduli in ( compactified ) string theories  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce and discuss several novel features of inflation in superstring theories with moduli fields .",
    "the central question is whether acceptable inflation can occur in a natural way with no need for fine tuning or for multiple correlated periods of inflation .",
    "we argue that this is indeed the expectation in the presence of moduli fields .",
    "first we consider the possible scale for an inflationary potential in theories with a single stage of dynamical symmetry breakdown responsible for susy breaking in a ` hidden sector ' .",
    "contrary to commonly expressed opinions , it appears quite plausible for the scale of the inflationary potential to be of @xmath7 , consistent with the value needed to generate the observed cmb fluctuations .",
    "we then discuss whether fine tuning is neccessary in order to achieve a sufficiently flat potential .",
    "the novel feature considered here is the possibility that the initial conditions of moduli fields selected with just the values needed to generate successful inflation .",
    "this happens because the moduli fields are expected to have chaotic initial values , hence there will be _ some _ domains with the right initial conditions to give an inflationary potential . such domains will inflate leading , through quantum fluctuations , to ` eternal ' inflation ; these configurations will thus dominate the final state of the universe . with this motivation we consider the resultant inflationary potential , using a simple example as a guide , and find that it has a significant curvature , at about the maximum possible for slow roll inflation .",
    "we then consider the reheating phase and , in particular , the post - inflation production of gravitinos or other weakly coupled states .",
    "demanding that their thermal production during reheating be under control implies a general constraint on the inflationary potential and leads to the observationally testable prediction that there should be a negligible tensor component in the cmb anisotropy in models with a single stage of inflation .",
    "a second prediction following from the curvature of the inflationary potential is that the spectrum of scalar density perturbations should deviate from scale - invariance so as to suppress small - scale power .",
    "this provides a better fit to the observed clustering and motions of galaxies in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe .",
    "we demonstrate how even direct gravitino production is acceptably small in the favoured class of inflationary models in which the inflaton resides in a hidden sector of the theory .",
    "finally we discuss the implications of the polonyi problem , in particular for recent models which treat moduli as dynamic variables at the electroweak scale .",
    "if there is a stage of inflation in the early universe driven by approximately constant vacuum energy , then requiring that the associated quantum fluctuations should not create anisotropies in the cmb in excess of those observed by cobe bounds the scale of this potential energy , @xmath8 , to be at least two orders of magnitude below the planck scale .  @xcite .",
    "if the quadrupole is in fact due to scalar density fluctuations then the bound is even more restrictive as we shall see . ] at this energy scale , gravitational interactions and interactions due to string and kaluza - klein states with masses of @xmath9 are small , hence one can use an effective field theory to describe the inflation sector .",
    "this effective theory should of course contain the standard @xmath10 model .",
    "the condition that the electroweak symmetry breaking scale should naturally be small ( @xmath11 ) without fine tuning the parameters of the theory then requires it to be supersymmetric with susy broken ( softly ) only just above the electroweak scale .",
    "we shall consider in particular supergravity ( sugra ) theories based on local supersymmetry which include a description of gravity and are of the type that descend from the superstring .",
    "the @xmath12 sugra theory describing the interaction of gauge singlet superfields is specified by the khler potential @xmath13 , which determines the form of the kinetic term in the lagrangian .",
    "the scalar potential is  @xcite @xmath14\\ , \\label{v}\\ ] ] where the khler function @xmath15 , the indices @xmath16 denote derivatives with respect to the chiral superfields , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the superpotential which specifies the yukawa couplings of the theory and the scalar couplings related by supersymmetry .",
    "a criticism that is often levelled at models of vacuum energy driven inflation is that they require unnatural fine - tuning  @xcite .",
    "there are two parts to this problem .",
    "first of all , such inflationary models necessarily contain small parameters in order to generate an inflationary potential significantly lower than the planck scale .",
    "to provide a physical justification for this , one should perhaps associate the inflationary scale with one of the scales needed in viable unified field theories of the fundamental interactions .",
    "the second aspect of the problem concerns the initial conditions , specifically the question of how probable are the initial field configurations necessary to ensure an inflationary era . in this section",
    "we discuss both these issues in the context of supersymmetric inflation .",
    "let us first consider the mass scale(s ) to be expected in the effective field theory which may play a role in setting the energy scale for the potential in the inflation sector . we know that in string and/or compactified theories there are numerous states with mass of @xmath19 , where we use as our basic mass unit @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , the success of the supersymmetric unification prediction relating the strong and electroweak gauge couplings suggests there is a stage of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking at a scale @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the theory must also have a source of susy breaking characterized by the gravitino mass , @xmath22 .",
    "the most plausible origin for the latter is dynamical supersymmetry breaking via nonperturbative effects driven by a new interaction which becomes strong at a scale @xmath23 , thus inducing gaugino condensation in a hidden sector . in this case @xmath24 and the gaugino condensate @xmath25 . how could such scales affect a gauge singlet sector ?",
    "consider first the gauge symmetry breaking scale .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 , the gauge non - singlet fields which acquire a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath27 along a @xmath28-flat direction thus breaking the gauge symmetry , and by @xmath29 , the gauge singlet fields with masses of @xmath19 . allowing for a coupling between these fields , consider a superpotential of the form ( suppressing coupling constants of order unity ) @xmath30 from which we see that the gauge symmetry breaking vev in @xmath26 induces a vev in the massive field given by @xmath31 . if @xmath32 couples to other fields in the theory , they will acquire mass determined by this vev , the value of the mass determined by the strength of coupling .",
    "the point is that once a stage of symmetry breaking is generated below the planck scale in some sector of the theory , one may expect it to generate masses in every sector of the theory",
    ". however this conclusion may not be true during an inflationary era in a string theory .",
    "the reason is that in theories of this type all scales other than the planck scale must arise dynamically .",
    "the most obvious way is through the supersymmetry breaking sector via non - perturbative effects , which become strong at a scale @xmath23 far below the planck scale , driving a gaugino condensate .",
    "however one must then require that all other related scales are consistent with the formation of the condensate .",
    "for example if a gauge symmetry breaking vev is generated it is due to a supersymmetry breaking trigger .",
    "a vev for the @xmath33 field introduced above may be induced through radiative breaking in which the @xmath33 soft - susy - breaking mass - squared term in the lagrangian is driven negative by radiative corrections at some scale @xmath34 and minimization of the effective potential for the @xmath26 fields and the susy breaking sector together , requires the vev to be of @xmath35 , essentially independent of the susy breaking trigger .",
    "however this only happens when it is energetically favourable for the vev to develop and in particular _ can not _",
    "occur if there is a large potential energy associated with the inflation sector . in other words ,",
    "the inflationary potential will cause @xmath33 to acquire a soft mass term inhibiting the development of its vev until inflation is over .",
    "these considerations place an _ upper _ limit on the scale of inflation , viz .",
    "the positive inflationary potential should not exceed the energy scale involved in gauge and susy breaking otherwise the latter will be inhibited by the very inflationary phase it is supposed to drive .    in the literature ( e.g. ref.@xcite )",
    "this constraint has been implicitly interpreted as requiring that the inflationary vacuum energy should not exceed the non - zero @xmath36- or @xmath28-term contribution to the effective potential which is responsible for susy breaking .",
    "this is given by @xmath37 , leading to an upper bound of @xmath38 for the scale of the inflationary potential , which is indeed too small .",
    "there are two possible ways out of this apparent impasse .",
    "it may be that the interaction in a second sector also becomes strong and dynamically generates a second , larger scale which is responsible for inflation but does not lead to susy breaking after inflation .",
    "we disfavour this possibility because we are trying to avoid multiple correlated sectors when constructing a `` natural '' theory .",
    "however it is quite reasonable to expect that a single scale of dynamical susy breaking has a _ different _ magnitude during inflation than after inflation .",
    "for example the inflationary potential may inhibit gauge symmetry breaking in the manner discussed above .",
    "if this symmetry breaking relates to the group which drives susy breaking ( when its interaction becomes strong ) , the result is that the @xmath39-function of the group is bigger during inflation , hence the scale at which the coupling becomes strong is higher , in turn driving a larger scale of susy breaking .",
    "a second possibility is that the inflation scale is related to the scale , @xmath23 , at which the coupling becomes large and not to the final susy breaking scale .",
    "indeed this seems to us the more reasonable choice for certainly @xmath23 is a relevant scale of new physics , for example , connected with the appearance of confined massive states .",
    "thus it is perfectly possible that due to the initial conditions the vacuum energy starts off at the natural binding energy scale @xmath40 and only drops to the scale @xmath41 as the fields ( in this case the inflaton ) adjust to their vacuum values .",
    "clearly such a scenario requires a strong cancellation between the terms contributing to the vacuum energy at the minimum but this is just what is usually assumed about gaugino condensation .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , inflation at the @xmath7 scale is compatible with all constraints for a sub - class of inflationary models which are of the ` new '  @xcite rather than of the ` chaotic '  @xcite type .",
    "this is marginally consistent with the identification of the scale with @xmath42 , given the uncertanties involved in this identification .    within these constraints",
    "we consider it to be the expectation rather than the exception for there to be sectors in the theory associated with the mass scale required for acceptable inflation . to demonstrate this we may use the mechanism discussed above to construct a model for inflation in which the scale of the potential is set by the original spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry ( and , if this scale is not fundamental , by the associated susy breaking trigger , provided the scale is constrained in the manner just discussed ) .",
    "the starting point is the form of the potential describing the inflaton which , for the reasons discussed above , we take to be a gauge singlet , @xmath43 ; at this stage we need not specify whether it is an elementary scalar field or arises as a composite object .",
    "the coupling between the superfield @xmath17 containing the inflaton and @xmath32 will be constrained by any symmetries of the theory .",
    "the superpotential of eq.([w ] ) has an @xmath44-symmetry under which @xmath32 and @xmath45 transform as @xmath46 , @xmath47 transforms as @xmath48 while the superspace coordinate transforms as @xmath49 .",
    "consider the sector with an @xmath44-singlet , gauge singlet , superfield @xmath17 which contains the ( complex ) inflaton field , @xmath43 as its scalar component .",
    "the most general superpotential , @xmath50 , describing @xmath29 , @xmath33 and @xmath17 , has the form dictated by this @xmath44-symmetry , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a function which is not constrained by the @xmath44-symmetry alone .",
    "( we have absorbed the constant term generating the @xmath32 mass in @xmath53 . )",
    "as discussed above , once @xmath54 acquire vevs breaking the gauge symmetry , the field @xmath32 will also acquire a vev , @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 ) leading to the inflaton superpotential @xmath57 of course there are other ways to motivate this form ; the most obvious is that it arises directly from the gaugino condensate sector in which the confined states have mass of @xmath58 and the inflaton is one of these composite states .",
    "we shall consider a particular choice for @xmath59 in section  [ simple ] but first we consider the general features of such a superpotential .",
    "the first point is that the associated potential for the inflaton @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath60 , showing how the gauge breaking scale naturally sets the scale for the potential of light fields in the effective potential obtained by integrating out massive fields . by appealing to a richer symmetry structure",
    "one can construct examples in which the scalar potential is proportional to different powers of @xmath61 , but this example suffices to illustrate the general point .",
    "moreover it will turn out that this power is just what is required for acceptable inflation generating the observed amplitude of density perturbations .",
    "we turn now to the second part of the naturalness question , namely whether one requires fine tuning of the initial conditions or of the parameters determining the potential for there to be an inflationary era  @xcite .",
    "consider the structure of the scalar potential following from the superpotential , @xmath62 .",
    "it will be determined once the khler potential is specified but for now we need merely assume that it has at least one local maximum or point of inflection . if the initial conditions are such that the field lies very close to this point then there will be an inflationary era .",
    "of course if the initial value of the field is determined by the high temperature effective potential  @xcite then it is unlikely that this value coincides with the point at which the first derivative of the potential vanishes , unless one fine tunes the parameters of the potential to ensure this .",
    "if , however , thermal effects do not fix the initial state , then it will have , in general , a broad distribution  @xcite .",
    "in this case , while there may only be a small probability that one starts with the value needed for an inflationary era , the region posessing this initial value _ will _ inflate and become the overwhelmingly probable state after inflation .",
    "this is the basic idea which leads us to the conclusion that weakly coupled fields which are not in thermal equilibrium below the planck scale are overwhelmingly likely to generate inflation without the need for any fine tuning .    to quantify this ,",
    "consider a field @xmath43 which drops out of thermal equilibrium at temperatures below the planck scale .",
    "( note that this is what we expect for the field with interactions described by the superpotential of eq.([i ] ) because the leading cubic term giving a yukawa coupling and associated quartic scalar couplings , has a coupling of @xmath63 . ) at the planck temperature it is reasonable to suppose that through gravitational effects the field has thermal fluctuations given by @xmath64 about some value set by the physics at the planck scale .. for a generic potential @xmath65 with small coupling @xmath66 , the field value can be thus much larger than the planck scale as is required in chaotic inflation .",
    "however in string theories couplings are of order unity so the initial field value should _ not _ be taken to be much larger than the planck scale . ] due to the spatial derivative terms in the lagrangian the field will be smoothed out over a horizon volume by the kibble mechanism .",
    "thus as the universe cools below the planck scale , one might suppose that the fields free stream and ( averaging over the enlarged horizon ) settle in to their planck scale mean values with deviation @xmath67 at a temperature where the horizon contains @xmath68 planck volumes .",
    "however as the temperature drops the potential energy associated with the random initial conditions will become comparable to the thermal energy and the field expectation values will move to reduce the potential .",
    "this will be a complicated process , dependent on the initial field configurations , in which the various fields do _ not _ free stream but are correlated in any given horizon volume and as a result the fields are _ not _ likely to head to the mean values fixed at the planck scale .",
    "thus we conclude that the field values in different horizon volumes will , apart from sharing excluded regions of field space for which the potential energy is greater than the thermal energy , be largely uncorrelated until a",
    "( very low ) temperature at which the excluded regions of field space grow sufficiently precisely to specify the allowed regions .",
    "the implication is that one should use a ( flat ) distribution of initial values , as at the planck scale .",
    "let us now consider the case when the mean value of the field in any horizon volume lies at a local maximum or point of inflection of the potential , at the temperature for which the potential energy at this point is comparable to the thermal energy .",
    "this is just the situation discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite wherein it was shown that despite the fluctuations of the field throughout the horizon volume it behaves as if it were a classical field with value given by the mean and evolving according to the equation of motion @xmath69 where we have expanded about the point of the potential for which the first derivative vanishes .",
    "inflation will occur if the first term on the lhs is negligible ( i.e. if @xmath70 ) . since the two quantities are typically of the same order , whether this happens or not depends on the detailed values of the parameters .",
    "assuming that it does , inflation will continue until the curvature of the potential becomes significant at @xmath71 .",
    "this determines the number of e - folds of inflation to be @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the initial value of @xmath43 .",
    "this is given by @xmath74 the temperature at which the thermal and false vacuum energy in the de  sitter phase are about equal  @xcite ; thus @xmath75 , which can be used in eq.([n ] ) to determine @xmath76 .",
    "if there are no very small parameters we have @xmath77 , so inflation will be limited to a few tens of e - folds .",
    "now we can complete the quantitative estimate of the probability that we end up with an inflationary universe . with our best guess for the initial conditions being an uniform distribution over the planck scale ,",
    "the probability we start with @xmath43 within a distance @xmath73 of the maximum of the potential is just @xmath78 .",
    "however this is more than compensated for by an inflation of tens of e - folds , so the final state of the universe is dominated by states which have enjoyed an inflationary era .    as we have seen , the initial field configuration with vanishing derivative for the scalar potential dominates the final state of the universe due to the inflationary expansion associated with such a configuration .",
    "one may then consider the possibility that the second derivative also vanishes , for in this case the amount of inflation increases . in theories following from the superstring",
    "such a possibility appears to be quite likely because the couplings which determine the higher derivatives are themselves determined by the vevs of moduli fields .",
    "if the initial values of these vevs are random , there will be regions in which the initial conditions are such that the second derivative vanishes too .",
    "this process will not continue to an arbitrary degree for there are only a finite number of moduli and the condition that a higher derivative vanishes determines some combination of them .",
    "however it is quite plausible that there are sufficient moduli   undetermined by the time the inflationary potential dominates that at least the second derivative vanishes .",
    "( then there will be many more e - folds of expansion than the @xmath79 needed for the observable universe to arise from one causally connected domain . ) while it is possible that further derivatives may vanish , this is irrelevant in determining the implications for the observable universe , so in what follows we consider examples in which only the first two derivatives are zero .",
    "in fact it has been pointed out to us ( a.  linde , private communication ) that this picture fits in very well with the concept of ` everlasting eternal inflation '  @xcite in which , during the slow - roll , quantum fluctuations continally produce regions _ closer _ to the maximum of the potential .",
    "although the initial probability for this is small , these regions become exponentially larger than the remainder and thus ultimately dominate the final state of the universe . in this way the inflationary universe reproduces itself eternally ,",
    "so essentially all final states descend from an inflationary era . in terms of the moduli",
    ", the initial state is continually being driven to the optimal choice of moduli vevs for which the infationary potential is flattest .",
    "this is the ultimate `` fine tuning without fine tuning '' !",
    "we note that for _ any _ inflationary model it is essential to invoke a mechanism of this sort if one is to overcome the argument@xcite that there is apparently a hopelessly small chance that the initial conditions of the universe are sufficiently homogeneous and isotropic for inflation to start at all .      before making a specific choice for @xmath59 in eq.([i ] )",
    "let us consider the overall constraints on the scale of inflation .",
    "in order to illustrate these , we specialize to the minimal choice of khler potential , @xmath80 , corresponding to canonical kinetic energy for the scalar fields .",
    "( this is known to be the case in certain orbifold models , however here we make this choice for pedagogic reasons ; the discussion can be extended to non - minimal khler potentials as well . ) with this choice the scalar potential following from the superpotential , @xmath62 , is  @xcite @xmath81_{\\phi=\\phi}. \\label{vi}\\ ] ] in what follows we shall consider slow - roll models in which the function @xmath53 can be expanded as a power series in @xmath82 or , as in simple chaotic inflation models where @xmath82 is large , is given by a combination of powers . if there are no small parameters other than @xmath83 ( as argued above , this is the simplest case and may eliminate the need for fine tuning ) then @xmath84 has a minimum at @xmath71 .",
    "clearly more complicated models can be constructed and we will comment on these later but our purpose here is to discuss whether the bounds on the reheat temperature imposed by consideration of the production and subsequent decay of unstable gravitinos present a problem for the generic model characterized by a _",
    "single _ energy scale .",
    "gravitinos or other unwanted fields will be thermally excited during the reheating epoch following inflation and decay subsequently into high energy particles .",
    "the effects of such decays on cosmological observables such as the primordial abundances of helium and deuterium and the spectrum of the cmb have been studied in some detail .",
    "the most stringent constraint on the gravitino abundance comes from the observational upper limit on the abundances of d and @xmath85he which can be produced via photofission of @xmath86he by the radiation cascades from gravitino decay : @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "taking the gravitino abundance produced during reheating by @xmath88 processes involving gauge bosons and gauginos to be  @xcite @xmath89 this implies an upper bound on the reheat temperature of  @xcite @xmath90 subsequent work  @xcite has shown that the true constraint is actually more restrictive than in ref.@xcite by a factor upto @xmath91 for a radiative lifetime greater than @xmath92 ( corresponding to @xmath93 ) but less stringent for shorter lifetimes .",
    "here we have taken the lifetime for gravitino decay into a gauge boson - gaugino pair , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of available channels ( assuming @xmath96 ) , so that  @xcite @xmath97 for a gravitino mass of @xmath98 , the radiative lifetime is about @xmath99 and the relevant constraint now comes from requiring that the photofission of deuterium not reduce its abundance below the observational lower limit  @xcite .",
    "a careful calculation shows that this requires @xmath100  @xcite so the reheat bound is weakened to @xmath101 .",
    "photofission processes become ineffective for @xmath102 but now there are new constraints from the effect of hadrons in the showers on the @xmath103he abundance .",
    "if the gravitino mass is 10  tev with a corresponding lifetime of @xmath104 , this constraint is @xmath105  @xcite , hence @xmath106 .",
    "there is _ no _ bound on @xmath107 for gravitinos of mass exceeding @xmath108 which decay before nucleosynthesis  @xcite but such a large mass can not be accomodated in minimal models . hence we take the reheat bound corresponding to the relic abundance in eq.([ekn ] ) as given in ref.@xcite , @xmath109 we emphasize that these are _ conservative _ bounds .",
    "for example in ref.@xcite the relic gravitino abundance is calculated to be a factor of @xmath110 higher than in eq.([ekn ] ) after including interaction terms between the gravitino and chiral multiplets ; this would tighten all the above bounds on @xmath107 by the same factor .",
    "however , the authors of ref.@xcite also numerically calculate the cosmological constraint based on d+@xmath85he photoproduction to be , inexplicably , a factor of @xmath111 more stringent than the one calculated analytically in ref.@xcite , which was confirmed by the full monte carlo simulation of ref.@xcite .",
    "consequently they obtain bounds on the reheat temperature which are much more severe than in eq.([contr ] ) , for example @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "recently the thermal production of gravitinos has been reexamined  @xcite ; it is argued , contrary to previous studies  @xcite , that massive gravitinos _ can _ achieve equilibrium with the background plasma at temperatures well below the planck scale via interactions of their longitudinal spin-1/2 ( goldstino ) component with a cross - section which increases as @xmath114 due to the breaking of susy by finite temperature effects .",
    "the relic abundance is then given by  @xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 , the number of relativistic degrees of freedom , equals 915/4 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) at @xmath117 . imposing the nucleosynthesis constraints discussed above then yields a very restrictive upper bound on the reheat temperature : @xmath118 however this claim has been questioned on general grounds  @xcite and an explicit calculation  @xcite of finite - temperature effects demonstrates that these do not alter the estimate in eq.([ekn ] ) .",
    "hence we will consider the impact on inflationary models of the reliable bound  ( [ contr ] ) but also note the implication of the proposed new bound  ( [ newtr ] ) , assuming a nominal gravitino mass of 1 tev .",
    "another aspect of the ` gravitino problem ' is the need to avoid direct production of gravitinos from the decay of the inflaton field during the reheating process  @xcite , given that there is always a gravitational strength coupling between the gravitino ( or any other state ) and the inflaton . unlike thermal production discussed above , this needs to be considered in the context of a specific model and we shall do so in section  [ direct ] .",

    "the number of e - folds from the end of inflation when this scale crosses the horizon is  @xcite @xmath136 where we have indicated the numerical values we anticipate for the various scales .",
    "the exact procedure for normalization is somewhat subtle  @xcite since it depends on the precise shape of the density perturbation spectrum and on whether there are other contributions to the cmb anisotropy such as from gravitational waves .",
    "the higher multipoles in the cmb anisotropy also depend on the assumed composition of the dark matter ( i.e. ` cold ' or ` hot ' ) since this determines how the primordial spectrum is modified on scales smaller than the horizon at the epoch of matter - radiation equality i.e. for @xmath137 mpc , assuming the dark matter to contribute the critical density  @xcite .",
    "however , these are small effects and well within the observational uncertainties so initially we assume that the anisotropy in the cobe data arises purely due to the sachs - wolfe effect on super - horizon scales ( @xmath138 ) at cmb decoupling .",
    "the best fitting quadrupole moment obtained from the angular power spectrum of the 2-year data , @xmath139k  @xcite , then corresponds to @xmath140 with an uncertainty of @xmath141 , taking @xmath142  k.

    "this is because the supergravity couplings involve @xmath158 where @xmath50 is the superpotential which is _ trilinear _ in the scalar fields , hence bilinear terms are suppressed by @xmath159 . )",

    "hence the constraint following from the need to inhibit thermal production of gravitinos forces the inflationary scale to be low ; the cobe normalization then requires the scalar potential to be very flat indeed . in turn",
    "this implies that the ratio of the tensor to the scalar contributions to the observed cmb anisotropy , given by @xmath162  @xcite , is negligible small .",

    "we have established the general conditions  ( [ constrain ] ) which ensure a sufficiently low reheat temperature . can these be achieved in realistic models ? as discussed in section  [ inflscale ] ,",
    "it is reasonable that a stage of symmetry breaking below the planck scale should generate an inflationary potential with a related scale .",
    "our example of gauge symmetry breaking gave @xmath166 ( eq.[delta ] ) , so one can easily obtain the required scale of inflation without any fine tuning .",
    "to discuss the small value required for the slope of the potential , we will have to specify what the dynamics of our inflationary scheme is , viz .",

    "we emphasize that by `` chaotic '' we specifically mean here models where the scalar field vev _ decreases _ during inflation from an initially large value beyond the planck scale .",
    "we are not referring to the random initial conditions of chaotic models , which we do indeed adopt ourselves .",
    "so far our analysis has been rather general .",
    "we now consider a specific example capable of giving inflation with small @xmath82 , which naturally satisfies the bound on the reheat temperature when the scalar density perturbations are normalized to the cobe observations",
    ". we will be able to study the remaining questions related to the reheat process in the context of this hybrid model which combines the dynamical evolution of new inflation with the initial conditions of chaotic inflation .",
    "in this model  @xcite the inflation sector @xmath62 , the susy breaking sector @xmath176 and the visible sector @xmath177 interact with each other only gravitationally and hence may be constructed separately in the superpotential . first consider the inflation sector .",

    "we noted earlier ( see eq.[i ] ) that it was natural for the superpotential to acquire an overall mass scale of this form due to the underlying symmetries of the theory .",
    "we also argued that the initial value of the field , @xmath73 , corresponding to the point at which the first derivative vanished would dominate the final state of the universe .",

    "the coefficient @xmath189 determines the value of the potential initially and hence the moduli will flow to minimize this . however",
    "if the other coefficients depend on independent combinations of the moduli they will be undetermined at this stage as they do not affect the initial vacuum energy .",
    "it is usually implicitly assumed that this is _ not _ the case , since all the moduli are supposed to get susy - breaking masses from gravitational coupling to the vacuum energy during inflation .",
    "however we stress that this is not likely for the random initial conditions assumed here . for example",
    "the simple khler potential @xmath190 leads to the potential @xmath191 . \\label{vj}\\ ] ] during inflation one term in the square brackets must be non - zero and thus one expects all fields @xmath192 , including moduli fields , to get a positive mass squared term .",
    "minimizing this potential will fix all the moduli vevs independently during inflation .",
    "however this form , if it applies at all , will do so only about an enhanced symmetry point corresponding to vanishing vevs for the @xmath193 . for initial conditions far from this point , @xmath194 ( and the corresponding exponential in eq.[vj ] ) will be a function of @xmath195 and @xmath196 , so minimization will lead to a correlated relation between the moduli fields , leaving other independent combinations of moduli unconstrained . as discussed earlier , we then expect that the initial conditions will allow _ some _ region in which the value of @xmath197 is just that needed to make the second derivative of the potential vanish and this will dominate the final state of the universe because of the enhanced amount of inflation it will undergo . thus we see that most of the features incorporated in eq.([ourpot ] ) following from eq.([sic ] ) are indeed natural and to be expected in any theory which has a potential with a turning point .",
    "the exceptional property is that @xmath62 is a perfect square .",
    "recall that this was required to ensure the vanishing of the cosmological constant at the minimum ( see eq.[lambda ] ) . by adjusting the term @xmath198 in eq.([f ] ) we can always arrange that @xmath84 vanishes , but not in a natural way .",
    "however it is not difficult to construct an alternative model which does not suffer from this problem at all .",
    "all that is needed is a reason why , at the end of inflation , the superpotential is at least quadratic in the inflaton field expanded about the minimum of the potential .",
    "this suggests an underlying symmetry , @xmath199 or larger .",
    "the example above does not have this symmetry because the khler potential is not quadratic about @xmath200 .",
    "it is straightforward to construct a variant which does have such a @xmath199 symmetry via the superpotential @xmath201 and a khler potential @xmath202 .",
    "now clearly the associated potential vanishes at the minimum as required . in this case",
    "the coefficient @xmath120 must be fine - tuned to give a potential with a turning point away from @xmath203 ( which will now be the initial value ) at which the second derivative also vanishes .",
    "however , as stressed above , in the case that @xmath120 is determined by moduli fields , the fine tuned value will _ automatically _ be selected when considering the most likely state of the universe .",
    "we will not pursue this example further since the model already introduced contains the significant features of this type of inflationary model .",
    "thus henceforth we will use the model of eqs.([sic ] ) and ( [ ourpot ] ) , which has this cancellation , as we proceed to consider the reheat phase .    integrating eq.([evolve ] ) back from the end of inflation , the field value corresponding to the spatial scales probed by cobe is @xmath204 $ ] using @xmath205 from eq.([ourpot ] ) , so @xmath206 which is @xmath207 for @xmath208 , i.e. as small as is required to solve the gravitino problem .",

    "the total number of e - folds of inflation is @xmath211 setting @xmath212 .",
    "thus we need @xmath213 to get @xmath214 as large as is neccessary to solve the cosmological horizon / flatness problems .",

    "this corresponds to a ` tilted ' spectrum with slope given by @xmath216  @xcite , so for the potential  ( [ ourpot ] ) , we get @xmath217 which has less power on galactic scales in a cdm cosmogony and thus will provide a better match to observations  @xcite . because of the tilt , the normalization to the cobe anisotropy is now somewhat higher corresponding to @xmath218  @xcite for the perturbation amplitude at large scales .",
    "this gives @xmath219 i.e. the inflationary scale is about @xmath220 and the inflaton mass is about @xmath221 .",
    "the reheat temperature is then @xmath222 well below the conservative bound  ( [ contr ] ) and consistent with even the recently proposed bound  ( [ newtr ] ) .",
    "it is not sufficient to inhibit the thermal production of gravitinos ; it is necessary , in addition , to suppress their production via inflaton decay .",
    "this is a particularly important for an inflaton in the hidden sector for all its couplings are gravitational and therefore comparable to all states .",
    "thus the solution to the reheating constraint proves to be the problem where direct production is concerned .",
    "the couplings to the gravitino can indeed be suppressed but this is very model dependent .",
    "the best we can do here is to illustrate the problem and present a possible solution in the context of the model introduced above .",
    "the couplings of the inflaton with interactions specified by the superpotential of eq.([sic ] ) to the gravitino is contained in the general coupling @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the superpotential with superfields replaced by their scalar components .",
    "this leads to the coupling @xmath225 on the other hand the coupling of the inflaton to the scalar components of matter fields may be read from eq.([ourpot ] ) .",
    "the dominant coupling comes from the interference term when the first term is expanded , giving @xmath226 which contains quartic scalar couplings involving the inflaton and the matter fields in the full superpotential . in the mssm",
    "the dominant coupling will be to the top squarks and the higgs , @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the top yukawa coupling .",
    "we may use these couplings to deduce the relative production of gravitinos in inflaton decay .",
    "the crucial point is that although both couplings are gravitational in origin , there is a suppression factor @xmath229 in the gravitino coupling which follows because of the _ square _ appearing in the superpotential @xmath62 .",
    "as discussed earlier , this is dictated by the empirical requirement that there be no cosmological constant after inflation and may be expected in any model in which the contribution to the cosmological constant from the inflationary sector vanishes .",
    "the inflaton decays at a time given by eq.([tr ] ) , so using the virial theorem we may determine the mean value of the factor in eq.([hgrav ] ) to be @xmath230 giving @xmath231 is this suppression sufficient ?",
    "the gravitinos produced by inflaton decay are highly relativistic since @xmath232 . until they become non - relativistic",
    ", their energy density relative to that of radiation remains constant .",
    "however after they do , and until they decay ( or the universe becomes matter dominated ) their relative energy density grows linearly with the expansion factor .",
    "this amounts to a growth of approximately @xmath233 for a tev mass gravitino .",
    "thus the condition @xmath234 is adequate to make direct gravitino production phenomenologically acceptable .",
    "we see that this is amply satisfied by the value in eq.([deltasic ] ) fixed by the normalization to cobe .",
    "lastly we consider whether a decoupled field will have stored potential energy during inflation which is released very late , thus recreating the problems associated with such a field that inflation was supposed to cure  @xcite .",
    "the fields of concern abound in compactified ( string ) models  @xcite ; they include the moduli mentioned above which are responsible for determining the couplings in the theory , the field related to the dilaton which determines the gauge coupling , and the moduli fixing the khler structure determining the shape and radius of compactification .",
    "the precise details of this problem are model dependent but we shall present a general description of the problem and determine under what conditions one may hope to avoid it . a detailed exposition of this question has recently been given in ref .",
    "while we are broadly in agreement , our emphasis on the likely solution is different and we have a new proposal as to how to deal with the moduli ( as distinct from the dilaton ) .",
    "the question of weak scale moduli has also been recently discussed elsewhere  @xcite ; here we include a discussion of much lighter moduli of the type which arise if they are to determine the couplings of the standard model through their effect on the electroweak effective potential  @xcite .",
    "suppose , as is expected in realistic models , that there is a stage of spontaneous symmetry breaking below the planck scale and denote by @xmath235 the scale of the relevant potential .",
    "now the moduli , @xmath188 , which determine the couplings of the theory enter this potential only in the form of higher dimension operators suppressed by inverse powers of the planck mass : @xmath236 where @xmath126 is some function .",
    "if @xmath235 is the largest scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking then the vevs of the moduli are obtained by minimizing this potential .",
    "of course it may be that this is not sufficient to determine all moduli , in which case one must consider further sectors of spontaneous breaking , as in models  @xcite where the couplings of the standard model are determined in this manner by the electroweak symmetry breaking potential .",
    "the properties of the moduli field are very similar to those of the inflaton discussed above ; its couplings are of gravitational strength and its mass is very small , suppressed by inverse powers of the planck mass .",
    "thus the moduli will have a lifetime given by @xmath237 we are concerned with the case @xmath238 for then the moduli will decay , after inflation , at very late times and release too much entropy if the energy stored in the field is large . to estimate the magnitude of this stored energy we note that the moduli typically acquire a mass of @xmath239 during inflation  @xcite .",
    "the sign of this term depends on the theory ; if one takes the canonical kinetic term it will be positive and tend to stabilise the potential around @xmath240 but if negative it will drive a large vev  @xcite .",
    "the expectations for the two cases are , respectively : @xmath241 in the second case , minimization of the simple form for the potential assumed above requires the moduli to be driven to large values , in excess of the planck scale .",
    "this is probably unrealistic and all we will assume in this case is that the moduli are large , of @xmath19 , but dependent on @xmath61 .",
    "after inflation the vev of the moduli will clearly not depend on @xmath61 .",
    "there are really only two possibilities , viz .",
    "@xmath242 or @xmath243 .",
    "the former can be shown to be a local minimum , for the moduli carry quantum numbers under discrete and/or other symmetries and the vanishing vev corresponds to a point of enhanced symmetry  @xcite .",
    "we can now quantify the problem .",
    "the energy stored in the potential during inflation and released afterwards as the moduli flow to their minima will be of @xmath244 _ unless _ the positions of the minima during and after inflation coincide to an accuracy much better than @xmath245 . for the second possibility of eq.([vevc ] ) , it is unreasonable to suppose that the minima coincide to this accuracy .",
    "for the first possibility , the minima could coincide but _ only _ if after inflation the moduli vev remain zero corresponding to the enhanced symmetry point .",
    "apart from this possibility , the energy in the moduli relative to the inflaton , just as inflation ends , is @xmath246 .",
    "however the important point to note is that the moduli are _ not _ in thermal equilibrium and will evolve according to their equation of motion analogous to eq.([evolve ] ) . from this",
    "it follows that the evolution of the field towards its minimum starts only at @xmath247 when @xmath248 . until then",
    ", the energy in the moduli field is in the form of potential energy and thus grows relative to the energy in the inflaton field ( or the products of the inflaton after reheating ) . at @xmath247 , the moduli roll rapidly to their minimum , converting the potential energy into kinetic energy .",
    "however at this point @xmath249 , following immediately from the condition that the roll starts .",
    "now both the inflaton and moduli are non - relativistic , so @xmath250 remains constant until the time given in eq.([tr ] ) when the inflaton decays .",
    "thereafter until the moduli decay ( or the ( non - moduli ) universe becomes matter dominated ) , there will be a relative growth in the moduli energy proportional to the scale - factor .",
    "following ref.@xcite this can be estimated to be , @xmath251\\ .",
    "\\label{eg}\\ ] ] clearly , any such growth is unacceptable as the universe will be matter dominated by the moduli , hence the entropy released by their subsequent decay will be far too large .",
    "we can envisage just three possible solutions to this problem :    \\(i ) the moduli are fixed by a stage of symmetry breaking _ before _ inflation , i.e. @xmath252 . for example , new non - perturbative effects at a scale above that responsible for susy breaking may generate large moduli masses ; however in all known examples these correspond to theories with negative cosmological constant , hence the universe necessarily suffers rapid gravitational collapse and does not evolve to a large enough size  @xcite .",
    "this does not exclude the idea altogether because there may well be string theories with such large non - perturbative effects and vanishing cosmological constant , but certainly one should find an example before concluding that this possibility is viable . here",
    "we would like to point out a simple mechanism for generating moduli masses much larger than the susy breaking scale .",
    "we know that a large scale of symmetry breaking may be triggered by susy breaking along @xmath28- and @xmath36- flat directions .",
    "this comes about because a susy breaking scalar mass - squared for a field @xmath253 which may be positive at the planck scale can be driven negative at a lower scale , @xmath34 , by radiative corrections .",
    "this will trigger symmetry breaking along a @xmath28- and @xmath36- flat direction ( if there is one ) .",
    "the important point is that the vev induced is energetically favoured to lie close to @xmath34 , _ independent _ of the susy breaking scale , even though it acts as the trigger .",
    "this vev in turn can generate moduli masses of @xmath254 from a term in the superpotential of the form @xmath255 , where the quadratic structure applies near the point of enhanced symmetry  @xcite .",
    "thus we consider it quite likely that theories with a large intermediate scale of symmetry breaking will have moduli masses sufficiently large to avoid the polonyi problem .",
    "however this mechanism does not work for the dilaton whose couplings have a different character .",
    "although it is unlikely that the dilaton should acquire a mass much higher than the electroweak scale  @xcite , it is not proven that this can not happen through non - perturbative effects ; indeed it has been conjectured that this does indeed happen  @xcite . in our opinion",
    "this would be the best solution , since otherwise it appears impossible to construct an inflationary potential at all .",
    "this is because in superstring theories the potential necessarily has a dependence on the dilaton and , with a light dilaton , the curvature of the potential in the dilaton direction is too large to permit inflation  @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the moduli minima are the _ same _ during and after inflation .",
    "as stressed above , this is quite reasonable but only if this corresponds to a point of enhanced symmetry .",
    "the example given above illustrates how this comes about .",
    "however this explanation will not allow scenarios in which the moduli and associated yukawa or soft susy breaking masses are determined at a low scale such as the electroweak breaking scale  @xcite , because in this case the moduli vevs adjust in response to low energy phenomena ( such as the alignment of soft masses with the fermion masses ) which arise only on electroweak breaking .",
    "it seems exceedingly unlikely that the low energy minimum would , in this case , correspond to the minimum of the moduli during inflation .",
    "\\(iii ) the cosmology is non - standard after @xmath256 .",
    "it has been suggested that there may have been a brief secondary period of inflation ( before baryogenesis ) during which the moduli roll to their minima  @xcite ; the following reheat phase then dilutes the moduli energy .",
    "( this is effectively equivalent to the possibility @xmath252 but with a smaller @xmath61 . ) to be viable , this scenario must be carefully constructed  the second epoch of inflation must be short enough not to erase the density perturbations produced in the initial inflationary era , but long enough to adequately dilute the moduli energy .",
    "now if the moduli are to roll to their minimum , the hubble parameter during the second phase of inflation must be less than the moduli mass .",
    "for the case of moduli with electroweak scale masses considered in refs.@xcite this requires the vacuum energy during inflation to be at an intermediate scale of @xmath257 .",
    "there should be fewer than @xmath258 e - folds of inflation if the density perturbations generated in the first stage of inflation are not to be erased .",
    "finally the reheat phase must proceed through unsuppressed renormalizable couplings to standard model states in order to avoid reintroducing the moduli problem via the new inflaton . a particularly promising scenario for this second stage of inflation",
    "has been suggested recently  @xcite . it is noted that thermal effects can keep the field value at the origin from the temperature , @xmath259 , at which the potential dominates , until the temperature",
    ", @xmath260 , at which the supersymmetry breaking mass triggers the phase transition .",
    "thus the number of e - folds of inflation is automatically limited .",
    "further it is plausibly argued that the relatively low scale of symmetry breaking needed to solve the moduli problem ( i.e. @xmath261 ) is expected in supersymmetric theories with flat directions .",
    "such an epoch of ` thermal ' inflation is expected to occur irrespective of previous stages of inflation .",
    "thus there is no conflict with our criterion of naturalness , i.e. we do not require multiple _ correlated _ periods of inflation .",
    "however , while this may cure the problem for moduli with weak scale masses , it can not do so for much lighter moduli because the energy stored in such fields is not released until the hubble parameter falls below their mass and they start to roll .",
    "in particular the moduli whose vevs are determined at the electroweak scale have masses of @xmath262 , and their energy will _ not _ be diluted by inflation at an intermediate scale . to invoke the solution of refs.@xcite one",
    "now needs inflation at the weak scale with an inflationary potential of @xmath263 .",
    "however the reheat temperature is then far below the value of @xmath264 needed to avoid disrupting standard nucleosynthesis .",
    "one can argue that along a flat direction the potential may be of @xmath263 while still having renormalizable couplings for the inflaton ; however , following the argument presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the reheat temperature will still be rather low , @xmath265 , where @xmath266 is a gauge or yukawa coupling .",
    "taking @xmath267 , this yields a maximum reheat temperature of @xmath268 ! given this problem we know of no way to reconcile moduli of mass @xmath269 with the cosmological constraints discussed above if their vevs are determined at the electroweak breaking scale .",
    "we have re - examined the possibilities for and the problems associated with supersymmetric inflation of the type that one might expect in compactified string theories . in the effective supergravity theory following from such theories below the planck scale , there are many hidden sectors corresponding to fields with only gravitational strength couplings .",
    "such sectors offer very plausible inflaton candidates because the fields have rather small masses , related to spontaneous symmetry breaking below the compactification scale . as a result , inflation , if it occurs , will be associated with a scale far below the planck scale , just as is required if an acceptable spectrum of density perturbations is to be generated . whether there is an inflationary era at all in such theories depends on the initial conditions and the form of the effective potential .",
    "we have argued that weakly coupled fields which are not in thermal equilibrium are likely to have random initial conditions . as a result",
    "the final state of the universe is dominated by regions which have undergone an inflationary era , corresponding to a choice of initial conditions of the moduli for which the potential is anomalously flat and to an initial value of the inflaton near the flat part of its potential .",
    "thus we consider that all the ingredients of an acceptable inflationary potential are present in effective supergravity theories without the need to fine tune the parameters or to seek forms of the potential such as in the chaotic inflation scenario which inflate for a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "an analysis of the possible origin of the scale of inflation suggests that it should be bounded above by the scale of susy breaking .",
    "if this arises through gaugino condensation then the relevant scale may be of @xmath270 .",
    "inflationary models with a flat potential and sub - planck scale vevs require such an intermediate scale to generate the correct level of density perturbations .",
    "on the other hand chaotic inflationary models require a much larger scale .    the main difficulty encountered by supergravity inflationary schemes concerns the cosmology _ after _ inflation .",
    "this is because the many hidden sector fields which were desirable to give candidate inflatons now cause severe problems . due to their weak coupling",
    "they decay very late in the evolution of the universe and , if they contain a sizeable fraction of the total energy density , produce unacceptable amounts of entropy in the process .",
    "we discussed three aspects of this problem in some detail .",
    "the first is the thermal production of such weakly coupled states , e.g. the gravitino , due to reheating after inflation .",
    "we noted that the hidden sector inflaton avoids this problem in a very natural way for , having only gravitational strength couplings , it reheats the universe to a low temperature . in simple models with only a single stage of inflation",
    "it is possible to relate the reheat temperature directly to the spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "we found that normalizing the latter to the cobe data constrains the reheat temperature to be @xmath271 , comfortably within the phenomenological bounds for a tev scale gravitino .",
    "an important , and observationally testable , implication is that there should be a negligible tensor component in the cmb anisotropy and that the power spectrum of scalar density perturbations should be tilted away from scale - invariance .",
    "the models which provide this nice consistency have small values of the inflaton field relative to the planck scale .",
    "in contrast , models of the chaotic type ( e.g. ref.@xcite ) give too high a reheat temperature if they are normalized to generate the correct amplitude of density perturbations .",
    "of course it is possible to evade these conclusions by postulating non - standard evolution after the inflationary era but such schemes may require a measure of fine tuning if they are not to destroy the density perturbations produced by the initial stage of inflation .",
    "moreover , given the success of the simplest schemes , it seems to us reasonable to consider their predictions as the paradigm , rather than those of more involved models , e.g. involving two coupled fields  @xcite , which are constructed to avoid problems not encountered in the simple ones .",
    "the second potential problem for the supergravity inflation models is the direct production of gravitinos and other weakly coupled states through inflaton decay .",
    "this is more model dependent than thermal production and we have considered this problem only for minimal supergravity .",
    "we find that the _ empirical _ requirement that there be vanishing cosmological constant in the inflaton sector after inflation provides the required suppression of the production of gravitinos relative to matter fields .",
    "again we find that the bounds for a tev mass gravitino are easily satisfied for a low inflationary scale .",
    "finally we considered the polonyi problem , viz .",
    "the difficulty in suppressing the potential energy stored during inflation in weakly coupled hidden sector fields such as the moduli of compactified string theories .",
    "we considered three possible solutions .",
    "the first is that all moduli have vevs fixed at a scale above inflation .",
    "the second is that the minimum of the potential during inflation coincides with the minimum after inflation .",
    "the third is a late stage of inflation . in all cases",
    "the implication is that the moduli _ can not _ be treated as dynamical variables at the electroweak scale determining the couplings in the low energy theory .",
    "the low reheat temperature requires the baryon asymmetry of the universe to be generated at a relatively low energy scale and there is a natural mechanism  @xcite to achieve this in the context of supergravity inflation .",
    "we are presently examining this question as well as the detailed expectations in our model for observations of large - scale structure  @xcite .",

    "<S> this is low enough to solve the gravitino problem but high enough to allow baryogenesis after inflation . </S>",
    "<S> such consistency requires that the generation of gravitational waves be negligible and that the spectrum of scalar density perturbations depart significantly from scale - invariance , thus improving the fit to large - scale structure in an universe dominated by cold dark matter . </S>",
