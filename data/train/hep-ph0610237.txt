    "there is a growing interest in applying the exact renormalisation group ( erg ) formalism to few- and many - body systems @xcite when the underlying interaction is essentially non - perturbative .",
    "regardless of the details all erg - based approaches share the same distinctive feature , a successive elimination / suppression of some modes , resulting in effective interaction between the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "one specific way of implementing such a procedure is to eliminate modes by applying a momentum - space blocking transformation with some physically motivated cutoff .",
    "the effect of varying a cutoff is described by nonlinear erg evolution equations , which include the effect of the eliminated modes.in the following we will use the variant of erg based on the concept of average effective action ( aea ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding evolution equation can written in the following general form      here @xmath1 is the second functional derivative of the aea taken with respect to all types of field included in the action .",
    "and @xmath2 is a regulator which should suppress the contributions of states with momenta less than or of the order of running scale @xmath3 . to recover the full effective action we require @xmath4 to vanish as @xmath5 0",
    ", in other respects its form is rather arbitrary .",
    "the concrete functional form of the regulator has no effect on physical results provided no approximations / truncations were made.by solving the erg equations one can find a scale dependence of the coupling constants and thus determine the erg flow .",
    "the whole approach is nonperturbative so that some physically motivated assumption about the functional form of the effective action should be made it is well known that the many - fermion system with attractive interaction favours the formation of the correlated fermion pairs leading to the symmetry breaking and related phenomena . since we expect the appearance of the correlated fermion pairs in a physical ground state , we need to parametrise our effective action in a way that can describe the qualitative change in the physics when this occurs .",
    "a natural way to do this is to introduce a boson field whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) describes this correlated pair @xcite and study the evolution of this effective degrees of freedom . at the start of the rg evolution ,",
    "the boson field is not dynamical and is introduced through a hubbard - stratonovich transformation of the four - point interaction . as we integrate out more and more of the fermion degrees of freedom by running the cutoff scale @xmath3 to lower values , we generate dynamical terms in the bosonic effective action . in this paper",
    "we treat both symmetric and asymmetric many fermion systems .",
    "the corresponding ansatz for the boson - fermion effective action consists of the kinetic terms for boson and fermions and the interaction term and for two types of fermions can be written as @xmath6 = \\int d^4x\\left(\\gamma_{b}[\\mu , k]+\\gamma_{f}[\\mu , k]+ \\gamma_{i}[k]\\right)\\ ] ] here @xmath7 is the boson ( fermion ) part of aea @xmath8      and @xmath10 is the interaction term @xmath11 m is the reduced mass of the fermion in vacuum and the factor @xmath12 with @xmath13 in the boson kinetic term is chosen simply to make @xmath14 dimensionless .",
    "the coupling @xmath15 , the wave - function renormalisations factors @xmath16 and the kinetic - mass renormalisations factors @xmath17 all run with on @xmath3 , the scale of the regulator . having in mind the future applications to the crossover from bcs to bec ( where chemical potential becomes negative ) we also let the chemical potentials @xmath18 and @xmath19 run , thus keeping the corresponding densities ( and fermi momenta @xmath20 ) constant .",
    "the bosons are , in principle , coupled to the chemical potentials via a quadratic term in @xmath21 , but this can be absorbed into the potential by defining @xmath22 .",
    "the evolution equations include running of chemical potentials , effective potential and all couplings ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "however , in this paper we allow to run only @xmath24 , parameters in the effective potential ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and chemical potentials since this is the minimal set needed to include the effective boson dynamics .",
    "the system with one type of fermion corresponds to the limit @xmath27 .",
    "we expand the effective potential about its minimum , @xmath28 , so that the coefficients @xmath29 are defined at @xmath30 , @xmath31 where we have introduced @xmath32 .",
    "similar expansion can be written for the renormalisation factors .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion run with the scale .",
    "the phase of the system is determined by the coefficient @xmath33 .",
    "we start evolution at high scale where the system is in the symmetric phase so that @xmath34 .",
    "when the running scale becomes comparable with the pairing scale ( close to average fermi - momentum ) the system undergoes the phase transition to the phase with broken symmetry , energy gap etc .",
    "the point of the transition corresponds to the scale where @xmath35 .",
    "the bosonic excitations in the gapped phase are gap - less goldstone bosons .",
    "note , that in this phase the minimum of the potential will also run with the scale @xmath3 so that the value @xmath36 determines the physical gap .",
    "the important part of any erg treatment is the choice of the regulator .",
    "ideally , the physical results should not depend on this choice .",
    "however , some sort of truncations and approximations should always be made in real calculations to render the system of the resulting evolution equations solvable so that the convenient choice of the regulator is the question of significant practical importance . in our approach",
    "the boson regulator has the structure @xmath37 and the fermion regulator for both types of fermions has the structure @xmath38 note that this regulator is positive for particle states above the fermi surface and negative for the hole states below the fermi surface .",
    "the function @xmath39 should suppress the contributions of states with momenta near the fermi surface , @xmath40 .",
    "once a a large gap has appeared in the fermion spectrum , there are no low - energy fermion excitations and so the fermionic regulator plays little further role . however , while the gap is zero or small , it is crucial that the sign of the regulator match that of the energy , @xmath41 , and hence it is @xmath42 which appears in the sign functions .",
    "the other important part of the erg approach is fixing the boundary conditions which define the form of the aea at some initial scale so that at some large starting scale @xmath43 we demand that the lagrangian be equivalent to a purely fermionic theory with the contact interaction @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the strength of the energy - independent term in the effective nn interaction in vacuum .",
    "this is evaluated at the scale @xmath46 , using the same regularisation procedure as we apply in matter .",
    "this equation implies that @xmath33 and @xmath47 at the this scale are related by @xmath48 using this boundary condition we can relate the pairing phenomena in a many body invironment with the fermion - fermion interaction in vacuum .",
    "the boson potential @xmath49 is obtained by evaluating the effective action for uniform boson fields .",
    "it evolves according to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the volume of spacetime . substituting our expansion of @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : potexp ] ) , on the left - hand side leads to a set of ordinary differential equations for the @xmath52 .    for the boson wave - function renormalisation factor , @xmath24",
    ", we need to consider a time - dependent background field .",
    "taking @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant , we can get the evolution of @xmath24 from @xmath55 let us first consider the results of the calculations in the case of symmetric fermion matter .",
    "we solve the evolution equations numerically with two types of cutoffs .",
    "first , we use the smoothed step - function type of regulator ( called hereafter as @xmath56 ) @xmath57 where @xmath58\\ ] ] with @xmath59 being a parameter determining the sharpness of the step .",
    "second , we use the sharp cutoff function @xmath60 which is somewhat similar to one suggested in ref.@xcite for the pure boson case and chosen in a rather peculiar way to make the calculations as simple as possible @xmath61,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "the fermion sharp cutoff consists of two terms which result in modification of the particle and hole propagators respectively .",
    "the hole term is further modified to suppress the contribution from the surface terms , which may bring in the dangerous dependence of the regulator on the cutoff scale even at the vanishingly small @xmath3 .",
    "as an example , we focus on the parameters relevant to neutron matter : @xmath64 .",
    "let s first discuss the results obtained with the smooth cutoff @xmath65 .",
    "we found that the value of the physical gap is practically independent of either the values of the width parameter @xmath59 ( varied within some range ) or the starting scale @xmath46 provided @xmath66 .",
    "the results of the calculations are shown on fig . 1    numerical solutions to the evolution equations for infinite @xmath67 and @xmath68  fm , starting from @xmath69",
    "we show the evolution of all relevant parameters for the cases of fermion loops only ( orange / grey lines ) , and of bosonic loops with a running @xmath24 ( blue / black lines ) .",
    "all quantities are expressed in appropriate powers of @xmath70.,width=340 ]    at starting scale the system is in the symmetric phase and remains in this phase until @xmath33 hits zero at @xmath71 where the artificial second order phase transition to a broken phase occurs and the energy gap is formed .",
    "already at @xmath72 the running scale has essentually no effect on the gap .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we found very small ( on the level of 1@xmath73 ) contribution to the gap from the boson loops , due to cancellations between the direct contributions to the running of the gap and indirect ones via @xmath74 .",
    "the boson loops play much more important role in the evolution of @xmath74 and @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , they drive both couplings to zero at @xmath75 .",
    "we note however , that the effect of the boson loops for the gap may still be more visible if the evolution of the other couplings is included .",
    "+ the results obtained with sharp cutoff regulator which are shown on fig.2 .",
    "one immediate observation is that that the results become starting scale independent as long as @xmath66 similar to the case with the smooth cutoff .",
    "however , the artificial phase transition occurs at lower values of the running scale @xmath76 . at approximately @xmath77",
    "the value of the gap becomes scale independent .",
    "one notes that the curves obtained with different regulators and describing the evolution of the gap , being rather different at intermediate scales , approach each other with decreasing scale resulting in very close values for the physical gap .",
    "this is an encouraging results taking into account that , although the hypothetical exact results must be independent of the choice of the regulator in practice it is not garanteed at all given the assumed ansatz for the effective action and truncations made .",
    "the same conclusion also holds for the other quantities .",
    "the couplings @xmath78 and @xmath74 first grow with scale and then start decreasing eventually coming to zero .",
    "chemical potential begins to decrease at the point of phase transition and becomes scale independent at @xmath79 .",
    "however , in this case the numerical values of the chemical potentials obtained with different regulators differ by approximately @xmath80 so that this quantity is more sensitive to the details of effective action and to the trancations made .",
    "let us now discuss the results for the many fermion system with two fermion species . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case of the hypothetical `` nuclear '' matter with short range attractive interaction between two types of fermions , light and heavy , and study the behaviour of the energy gap as the function of the mass asymmetry .",
    "we choose the fermi momentum to be @xmath81 .",
    "one notes that the formalism is applicable to any type of a many - body system with two fermion species from quark matter to fermionic atoms so that the hypothetical asymmetrical `` nuclear '' matter is simply chosen as a study case .",
    "we assume that @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is always the mass of the physical nucleon .",
    "we see from this figure that increasing mass asymmetry leads to a decreasing gap that seems to be a natural result .",
    "however , the effect of the boson loops is found to be small .",
    "we found essentially no effect in symmetric phase , @xmath85 corrections for the value of the gap in the broken phase and even smaller corrections for the chemical potential so that one can conclude that the mf approach indeed provides the reliable description in the unitary limit for both small and large mass asymmetries .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , similar to above considered case of the fermion matter with one type of fermion , the boson contributions are more important for the evolution of @xmath74 where they drive @xmath74 to zero as @xmath75 making the effective potential convex in agreement with the general expectations .",
    "this tendency retains in the unitary regime regardless of the mass asymmetry .",
    "we have also considered the behaviour of the gap as the function of the parameter @xmath86 for the cases of the zero asymmetry @xmath27 and the maximal asymmetry @xmath87 .",
    "the results are shown on fig.4 .",
    "evolution of the gap as a function of the parameter @xmath86 .",
    "the upper pair of the curves corresponds to the calculations with no asymmetry in the mf approach ( dashed curve ) and with boson loops ( solid curve ) and the lower pair of the curves describes the results of calculations with the maximal asymmetry when @xmath87,width=326 ]      one can see from fig.4 that in the case of zero ( or small ) asymmetry the corrections stemming from boson loops are small at all values of the parameter @xmath86 considered here ( down to @xmath88 . on the contrary , when @xmath87 these corrections , being rather small at @xmath89 becomes significant ( @xmath90 ) when the value of @xmath86 decreases down to @xmath91 .",
    "we found that at @xmath91 the effect of boson fluctuations becomes @xmath92 already for @xmath93 .",
    "one can therefore conclude that the regime of large mass asymmetries , which starts approximately at @xmath94 , moderate scattering length and/or the fermi momenta is the one where the mf description becomes less accurate so that the calculations going beyond the mfa are needed .",
    "one might expect that the deviation from the mean field results could even be stronger in a general case of a large mass asymmetry and the mismatched fermi surfaces but the detailed conclusion can only be drawn after the actual calculations are performed .",
    "we were not able to follow the evolution of the system at small gap ( or small @xmath86 ) because of the non - analyticity of the effective action in this case .",
    "this non - analyticity of the effective action can explicitly be demonstrated in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the flow equations can be solved analytically in this case and one can see from the solution , which has a closed - form expression in terms of an associated legendre function , @xmath95 at @xmath96 , that the fermion loops contain a term @xmath97 . it remains to be seen whether , within the given ansatz , the full solution of the system of the partial differential equations for the effective potential and running couplings is required to trace the evolution of the system in the case of small gaps .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the pairing effect for the asymmetric fermion matter with two fermion species as a function of fermion mass asymmetry .",
    "we found that regardless of the size of the fermion mass asymmetry the boson loop corrections are small at large enough values of @xmath86 so that the mfa provides a consistent description of the pairing effect in this case .",
    "however , when @xmath91 these corrections become significant at large asymmetries ( @xmath94 ) making the mfa inadequate . in this case",
    "it seems to be necessary to go beyond the mean field description .",
    "there are several ways where this approach can further be developed . in the case of asymmetric systems",
    "the next natural step would be to consider the case of the mismatched fermi surfaces taking into account the possibility of formation of sarma @xcite , mixed @xcite and/or loff @xcite phases , exploring the importance of the boson loop for the stability of those phases and applying the approach to the real physical systems , for example fermionic atoms .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "the other important extension of this approach would be to take into account running of all couplings of the average effective action , use different type of cut - off function , preferably the smooth one and inlude both particle - hole channel and long range forces .",
    "the three body force effects @xcite , when the correlated pair interact with the unpaired fermion may also be important , especially for non - dilute systems .",
