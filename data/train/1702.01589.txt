    "slow neutron captures , making up the so - called @xmath4-process , are responsible for the production of about @xmath8 of nuclei heavier than iron .",
    "they take place during the @xmath9- and @xmath10-burning phases of massive stars for the production of nuclides between iron and strontium ( @xmath11 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the @xmath9-burning layers of low- and intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars for the main component ( between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on this latter astrophysical site , specifically the thermally pulsing agb phase of low - mass stars ( lmss , @xmath12 cycle at the base of the convective envelope ( hot bottom burning ) and the @xmath13 ( see later discussion in this section ) neutron source is only partially activated always because of low temperature reached . ] , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "during these stages , a star is characterized by a structure made of a @xmath10-@xmath14 degenerate core surrounded by two shells , the inner composed by helium and the outer hydrogen rich , burning alternatively @xcite . as shell @xmath15 burning proceeds while the @xmath9 shell is inactive , the mass of the @xmath9 increases and attains higher densities and temperatures . as a consequence , @xmath9-burning in the shell",
    "is temporarily activated by thermonuclear runaway flash events generating convective instabilities ( or thermal pulses ) thanks to sudden temperature enhancements .",
    "these stars undergo repeated mixing episodes ( the so - called third dredge - up , tdu ) of material below the h - burning shell , where @xmath9-burning and slow neutron captures occur , bringing the fresh material just produced toward the stellar surface @xcite . in this astrophysical scenario ,",
    "the main neutron source has been identified in the @xmath0 reaction activated in radiative conditions during the quiet phases between two subsequent thermal instabilities at a temperature of about @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a second neutron exposure is due to @xmath13 reaction during the convective instabilities of helium shell providing more intense neutron fluxes .",
    "however , this is only marginally activated because of typical low temperature , only about @xmath17 , of stars less massive than @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the typical neutron densities for @xmath4-process in lmss provided by the @xmath0 reaction are about @xmath19 .",
    "existing direct measurements , collected in the european compilation of reactions rates for nuclear astrophysics ( nacre ) by @xcite and the subsequent updated version by @xcite ( hereafter nacre ii ) , stop at the minimum value of about @xmath20 @xcite , whereas the region of astrophysical interest , the so - called gamow window @xcite , corresponds to about @xmath21 at a temperature of @xmath22 . at low temperature ,",
    "the main uncertainty source is represented by the presence of a resonance near the @xmath23-threshold corresponding to the @xmath24 excited state of @xmath25 .",
    "the most recent works @xcite present in the literature are oriented towards a substantial lowering of the reaction rate with respect to the one suggested by nacre @xcite , because it is believed that the role of the resonance mentioned above was overestimated in the past @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the @xmath0 reaction plays a crucial rule determining the neutron production and the time scale of @xmath26 burning at a given temperature , and influencing the possibility of a complete exhaustion of the fuel during the radiative phase @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "its efficiency is still matter of debate , aiming at reducing the uncertainty that can reach about @xmath27 in the most interesting astrophysical region @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 reaction is also activated in other different astrophysical sites @xcite , such as at the @xmath10-burning in massive stars ; at the beginning of @xmath9-burning phase ; and when there exist a proton injection in @xmath9-rich layers ( e.g. central @xmath9 flash in star less massive than @xmath28 ; for a late convective instability in nuclei of planetary nebulae at the beginning of wolf - rayet , type @xmath29 , phase showing little hydrogen and nitrogen enhancement at the stellar surface , on certain massive mass - losing stars ; and accretion of @xmath15-rich material on white dwarf in a binary system ) .",
    "the analysis of consequences of the @xmath0 reaction in these conditions is beyond the primary purpose of this article , but it is highly desirable .    after a brief presentation of the status of the art of the measurements for the @xmath0 reaction cross section ( sec .",
    "[ sec - status ] ) , we present in sec . [ sec - rea ] a new approach starting from indirect experimental data to constraint the absolute normalization factor of direct measurements at high energies .",
    "the astrophysical factor is calculated and compared ( sec .",
    "[ sec - astro - fac ] ) with the most recent works present in the literature , also focusing on the electron screening effect ( sec .",
    "[ sec - ele - scree ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec - rate ] we determine the recommended reaction rate for the @xmath0 reaction to be used in the astrophysical scenarios outlined above . in particular , here we will evaluate possible consequences on the @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "due to the relevance of the @xmath0 reaction as the main neutron source for the @xmath4-process in lmss , during last decades several measurements of its cross section have been performed covering different energy ranges .",
    "one of the most commonly adopted rate was that presented in @xcite , which takes into account experimental cross sections determined in previous works by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "later , an unprecedented accuracy of @xmath30 was reached by @xcite , triggered by the need to reliably subtract the background in the observation of geo - neutrinos ( e.g. in the kamland detector , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most recent work on the @xmath0 reaction by @xcite combines a high accuracy cross section measurements down to about @xmath31 @xmath32 with an extensive multi - channel @xmath33-matrix fitting of all cross section data for the channels feeding the @xmath25 states contributing to the @xmath0 reaction in the energy range below about @xmath34",
    ". however , many experimental difficulties exist ( e.g. coulomb suppression , electron screening effect , and a different absolute value ) when performing a direct measurement at the energies relevant for astrophysics . in this context ,",
    "two characteristics are evident for direct data concerning the astrophysical factor of the @xmath0 reaction : ( i ) the very high uncertainties due to the prohibitively small reaction cross section in the low - energy region ; ( ii ) data by @xcite appear to be consistent with each others , but they are different from ones of @xcite specially , for an issue connected to resolution , concerning the height of the resonances above @xmath34 . at the same time measurements of @xcite and @xcite are in agreement , but they are considerably lower , in absolute value , than those mentioned above .",
    "moreover , since direct measurements stop right at the edge of the gamow window , several experiments using indirect methods ( determining the spectroscopic factor and/or the asymptotic normalization coefficient , anc , for the @xmath35 level of @xmath25 near threshold ) have been performed to determine the cross section of this neutron source in the relevant energy region for astrophysics . in @xcite ,",
    "the measurement of the @xmath36 transfer reaction suggested a very small spectroscopic factor @xmath37 , then re - analysed by @xcite indicating a considerably stronger contribution , about a factor of @xmath38 larger , depending on the theoretical approach .",
    "the first determination of the anc for the @xmath0 reaction was performed by @xcite using the @xmath39 sub coulomb @xmath23-transfer reaction .",
    "the authors obtained a value of the squared coulomb - modified anc @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "this result , appearing to be inconsistent with the emerging scenario of the @xmath0 reaction , was recently revisited in the paper @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath23-transfer @xmath42 reaction was performed with a @xmath43 @xmath26 beam in inverse kinematics to achieve the lowest possible energy in the center - of - mass system .",
    "taking into account target deterioration , the squared coulomb - modified anc becomes @xmath44 , a factor of four larger than the one suggested in the first analysis of the same measurement .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also determined both spectroscopic factor , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; and the anc @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "therefore , independent anc experiments , using different transfer reactions and theoretical approaches , seems to indicate values for @xmath49 in the range @xmath50 ( see tab .",
    "[ tab - gam ] ) ; where the very low value suggested by @xcite , as already explained above , was recently revised in @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the thm reaction rate can be described by the following analytical expression : @xmath51 $ ] , where @xmath52 is the temperature in @xmath53 and @xmath54 parameters of this expression , collected in table [ tab - coef ] for the recommended @xmath0 reaction rate .        fig",
    ". [ rate ] show the reaction rate calculated from the thm @xmath55-factor ( red central line ) and compared to the reference one @xcite in the temperature range between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the two rates are compatible almost everywhere , but the greater divergence is just located in the most interesting region for astrophysics , i.e. the discrepancy at @xmath58 is around @xmath59 .",
    "the red band represents the corresponding statistical and normalization uncertainties of the order of @xmath60 and @xmath61 at lower temperature .",
    "higher differences are expected with the reaction rate suggested in @xcite ( green line ) , coming from the precedent analysis of thm data , because it is a factor @xmath62 larger than in @xcite and the present work calculation at @xmath63 .",
    "the rates for @xmath0 reaction by @xcite and @xcite are also represented ( normalized to * ? ? ?",
    "* adopted value ) in fig .",
    "[ rate ] with a cyan shaded region and a black curve , respectively .",
    "the rate from the present work agrees , within errors , with the updated nacre ii compilation @xcite recommended value in the temperature range of main astrophysical interest ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the great difference consists in the level of uncertainties , the upper limits of @xcite is @xmath65 higher than the corresponding recommended value , while in our case it is only @xmath66 at about @xmath67 ; on the other side , lower limits are @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , then the present rate is more accurate of about a factor of @xmath70 .",
    "in other temperature regions , the nacre ii rates ( both adopted and upper ) are at most about @xmath71 times higher than the rate reported here , while the lower limits are even closer to each other . on the other side , the reaction rate by @xcite significantly differs from the new thm one for temperatures higher than @xmath72 .",
    "these differences should be evaluated in all astrophysical sites mentioned in the first section for which the activation of the @xmath0 reaction is relevant .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to provide a rate for the @xmath0 reaction decreasing systematic errors connected to the normalization between measurements performed through indirect techniques and those direct data - sets showing different absolute values .",
    "this , in fact , still represents the main source of errors also in the nacre ii compilation @xcite . in order to verify the impact of the new rate for the @xmath0 reaction on stellar nucleosynthesis , we performed some theoretical prediction for the specific case of the @xmath4-processing in agb - lmss .    in this astrophysical scenario ,",
    "the @xmath0 is strictly connected to the amount of @xmath26 locally produced in the @xmath9-rich region of an agb - lms , as a consequence of some proton penetration during the phases subsequent to the development of thermal instabilities .",
    "the abundant @xmath73 can interact with these protons producing fresh @xmath26 through the reaction chain @xmath74 .",
    "too efficient proton captures , indeed , can activate a full cn cycling , leading to the production of @xmath75 through the reaction @xmath76 .",
    "this fact is of crucial importance because @xmath75 is a very efficient absorber for neutrons , the main @xmath3-poison in typical agb star conditions , which would inhibit the captures on heavier nuclei . at this point",
    "the star presents a @xmath26-pocket embedded in a @xmath9-rich environment , so that , when the temperature approaches @xmath77 , the @xmath0 reaction is activated , releasing neutrons .    in most evolutionary codes this penetration is treated as a free parameter suggesting a depth down to @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms were recently suggested to physically model the proton penetration in the @xmath9-rich region and to consequently form a @xmath26 reservoir .",
    "@xcite suggested gravity waves and kelvin - helmoltz instabilities as possible cause of proton penetration , while hydrodynamical effects induced by convective overshooting at the border of convective envelope were considered by @xcite . in @xcite also the effects due to rotation in stars are considered showing that the goldreich - schubert - fricke instabilities affect the formation of the @xmath26 pocket .",
    "the possibility that magnetic buoyancy represents a physical mechanism suitable to produce an extended @xmath26-pocket ( @xmath79 ) with a rather flat @xmath26 distribution was investigated in @xcite . in this scenario , the h - burning re - ignition induces a low concentration of @xmath26 ( but with a profile extending to several @xmath80 ) , yielding a negligible abundance of the neutron - poison @xmath75 .",
    "the idea of a large hydrogen penetration was originally suggested to reproduce the spectroscopic observations in young open clusters by @xcite , performed with new analysis methods and showing enhancements of @xmath4-element abundances with respect to the sun . to discriminate between different scenarios for the @xmath26-pocket formation or argue in favour of one reservoir profile with respect to another",
    "is beyond the aim of this paper .",
    "so , we only adopted the mechanism for proton penetration suggested in @xcite and performed @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis calculations by means of newton post - process code @xcite , containing a detailed network of more than 400 isotopes ( from @xmath9 to @xmath2 ) connected by @xmath23- , @xmath81- and @xmath3- reactions and weak interactions , in order to assess and understand the impact of the new rate for the @xmath0 reaction .    fig .",
    "[ astro ] shows the ratios between production factors with respect to solar abundances of neutron rich nuclei belonging to the @xmath4-process main component , that is considered to start at @xmath82 and corresponds to nuclides of elements between strontium and bismuth in lmss , adopting the reaction rate presented in this paper and the one of nacre ii @xcite assumed as the reference one , i.e. black and red dashed horizontal lines means no variations between two scenarios .",
    "we can note from fig .",
    "[ rate ] that in the interesting energy region for agb - lmss ( @xmath83 ) the @xmath0 reaction rates by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are very similar , so @xmath4-nucleosynthesis results are expected to be almost comparable . only isotopes that are produced exclusively by slow neutron captures ( the so - called @xmath4-only nuclei ) , being shielded against the fast decays of the @xmath84-process by stable isotopes , are reported in fig .",
    "[ astro ] .",
    "calculations in the upper panels ( a and c ) of fig .",
    "[ astro ] refer to a low - mass star of @xmath85 and almost solar metallicity ( @xmath86}=-0.15 $ ] , assuming as reference * ? ? ? * ) experiencing nine thermal instabilities .",
    "we considered this stellar model because in @xcite it was noticed that the results of the averaging procedure on lms models in the range between @xmath87 and @xmath88 are very similar to the calculations of the individual model at smaller mass .",
    "this fact was the consequence of the salpeter s initial mass function which favours lower masses in the weighting operation .",
    "for these reasons , this single model represents a reasonable example in order to reproduce the flat behaviour of solar distribution for @xmath4-process nuclei @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ astro ] we used bands in order to take into account also upper and lower limits of reaction rates of this paper and by @xcite .",
    "the production factors of the selected isotopes in the @xmath9-rich region of the star show that variations are very limited and they are always lower than @xmath89 , so the effect of reaction rate of tab .",
    "[ rate - tab ] is essentially negligible with respect to calculations obtained with @xcite reaction rate .",
    "the only peculiar variations are located in the region of gadolinium isotopes of panel ( a ) : there exists a production of @xmath90 and a destruction of @xmath91 , both around @xmath92 parts per thousands , with the new rate with respect to the @xcite one .",
    "however , the improvement in the accuracy of the predictions , as demonstrated by the shrinking of the uncertainty bands , is apparent , bespeaking the power of the approach outlined in this work .",
    "orange and blue curves correspond to the deeper ( @xmath93 ) and more limited ( @xmath94 ) proton penetration , and consequently for the extension of the @xmath26 reservoirs suggested in @xcite , respectively .",
    "the blue line , corresponding to a pocket with a smaller amount of @xmath26 , shows lower production of @xmath4-only nuclei , but variations are still of the order of few per thousands .",
    "differences between blue and orange curves are so limited that , not also being the aim of our article as we have already mentioned before , we do not conclude in favour of one @xmath26 reservoir with respect to the other , taking into account present - day accuracy of observational data .",
    "we underscore that the pfs in fig .",
    "[ astro ] are likely to be more sensible to the uncertainties affecting the reaction rate with respect to the total extension , in mass , of the two @xmath26 pockets described above .",
    "nonetheless , the mechanism for proton injection into the @xmath9-rich shell still represents a debated open issue strongly related to start - time , rate , profile , and mass of the @xmath81-penetration .",
    "the formation of @xmath26 reservoirs is then model - dependent because only full 3-dimensional magneto - hydrodynamical simulations could really help making progress in the understanding of the pocket and different choices for the quantities mentioned above could result in higher variations for the production of @xmath4-nuclei .",
    "the lower panels ( b and d ) of fig .",
    "[ astro ] show the same calculations of upper ones ( a and c , respectively ) , but adopting a different stellar model of @xmath88 and one third of solar metallicity ( @xmath86}=-0.50 $ ] ) experiencing eleven thermal instabilities .",
    "we performed calculations for different stellar models to separate the effect of the rate by the one connected to the variation of stellar parameters . in the @xmath88 case ,",
    "the neutrons from the @xmath95 source are important and produced at a rather high neutron density , while in the lower - mass models the @xmath26 source always dominates . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we use the same colours and symbols as before . as in previous cases ,",
    "the @xmath94 @xmath26 reservoir ( blue curve ) shows a more limited production for the @xmath4-only nuclei with comparison to the more extended one ( @xmath96 , orange line ) .",
    "comparing upper ( a and c ) and lower ( b and d ) panels of fig .",
    "[ astro ] , the @xmath88 and @xmath97 of solar metallicity star expects higher variations for @xmath4-only nuclei up to barium ( heavy @xmath4 peak ) with respect to star of @xmath85 and almost solar metallicity .    on the contrary ,",
    "comparing left ( a and b ) and right ( c and d ) panels on the same row we can note the @xmath26-pocket weakly influences the production and variations of production factor for @xmath4-only nuclei are smaller than those expected by changing the reference rate in the nucleosynthesis code .",
    "in particular , black and red curves , both obtained selecting the @xcite reaction rate , are very similar to each other , as well as in the case of orange and blue lines , representing the calculation performed with the @xmath0 rate presented in this paper .",
    "in the cases discussed above , the production of the @xmath4-isotopes seems to be slightly more dependent on reaction rate choice with respect to the extension of the @xmath26 , stressing on the importance of well known nuclear inputs , decreasing normalization uncertainties and determining a way to define the absolute value of measured astrophysical factor , in stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "moreover , the new calculation presented in this paper shows a reduction of the rate for the @xmath0 reaction with respect to our @xcite or @xcite determinations in the most interesting region for astrophysics . these conditions could leave a bigger amount of unburned @xmath26 @xcite than the previous predictions .",
    "some @xmath26 , survived from the inter - pulses stage , is engulfed in the convective shell and burns at higher temperatures , about @xmath98 , providing another neutron burst at higher densities via the @xmath0 reaction itself .",
    "the percentage of @xmath26 depends on the metallicity and initial mass of the star . as a consequence ,",
    "the activation of some @xmath4-process branchings could modify production and/or destruction of branching - dependent isotopes .",
    "verification of the results presented here using independent nucleosynthesis codes is highly desirable .",
    "in this paper , we present a new approach that , overturning the usually normalization procedure , strongly constraints absolute value of @xmath55-factor for direct measurements starting from indirect experimental data ; thus turning one of the most crucial drawbacks of indirect techniques into an advantage .",
    "this procedure , a priori , can be used for all those nuclear reactions of astrophysical interest which are characterized by great uncertainties at low energy and/or whose direct measurements show different absolute values for the corresponding astrophysical factor , for which ancs of one of more resonances are measured with high accuracy .",
    "we focused our attention on the case of the @xmath0 reaction because it represents the main neutron source for agb - lmss , yet , it is affected by large systematic errors due to the spread in absolute normalization even at high energies , as also recently confirmed by the nacre ii compilation @xcite . in particular , by implementing the recent and precise anc ( @xmath99 ) calculated by @xcite and the full width ( @xmath100 ) of @xcite for the threshold resonance that strongly affect the @xmath0 astrophysical factor in the corresponding gamow window into a modified r - matrix fit of thm data , it was possible to define an absolute normalization of direct data by @xcite are the only ones defining a concordance scenario together with anc measurements and thm data . on the contrary , other datasets ,",
    "@xcite plus @xcite or the combination of @xcite with @xcite and @xcite , seem to suggest higher values for the anc , as just observed in @xcite , not compatible with presently accepted values .    the fact that @xcite also predicted a small shift of about @xmath101 towards positive @xmath102 for the center of the resonance near the @xmath23-threshold did not result in substantial changes , given energy resolution characterizing the thm cross section @xcite .",
    "however , as an important consequence , the procedure to calculate the anc of the same resonance must be changed in comparison to what was previously done in @xcite . as just previously discussed , the calculated value for the squared coulomb - modified anc @xmath103 is @xmath99 and then well agrees with the determinations of @xcite and other works @xcite .    in the light of this concordance scenario , the thm cross section was fitted to determine the resonance parameters , used to determine the astrophysical factor for the @xmath0 reaction in the energy range between @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the resulting @xmath55-factor is lower than in @xcite and substantially agrees , inside errorbars , with ones shown in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "we then calculated the recommended reaction rate by means of standard equations providing both a tabular list and an analytical formula .",
    "adopting the new rate suggested in the present paper as input for the newton code @xcite for the @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis in lmss we expect only limited variations , less than few per thousand , for those nuclei whose production is considered to be totally due to slow neutron captures .",
    "we thank the referee for helping us improving the manuscript .",
    "we are grateful to m. busso and s. palmerini for collaboration and very useful discussion on @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis and a. m. mukhamedzhanov and b. irgaziev for what concerns anc calculation .",
    "thanks both department of physics and geology at the university of perugia and group 3 of infn , section of perugia , for financial support .",
    "in @xcite , we limited our discussion to the extraction of the anc for the @xmath0 reaction from thm data in the specific case of a bound state ( or @xmath106 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite in the case of a virtual or real decay @xmath107 , in the channel with relative orbital angular momentum @xmath108 , total angular momentum @xmath109 of @xmath110 , total angular momentum @xmath111 of the system @xmath112 , and when dealing with sub - threshold resonances , the squared anc ( @xmath113 , or @xmath49 for short ) can be derived from the reduced width for the bound state @xmath114 as follows @xcite : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the whittaker function and @xmath117 the channel radius .",
    "moreover , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the reduced mass of the @xmath120 system and the coulomb parameter for the bound state , respectively .",
    "the equation above has to be modified as for bound states at negative energies penetrability is zero , but the shift function can still be defined as the logarithmic derivative of the whittaker function @xcite .    in the case of @xmath0 reaction , the @xmath24 resonance state is close to the threshold and the coulomb factor can not be neglected defining the modified anc ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "there is one very important reason why we can not exclude the coulomb factor ; the renormalization does not change the reduced width , but allows one to operate with more reasonable ancs values than the standard ones . at very low energy , in collision of charged particles ,",
    "the coulomb factor is so huge that anc below threshold has very large value @xmath122 ( bound state ) .",
    "however , for capture to an unbound state , we have to use the following formula ( eq . 7 in",
    "* ) : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the potential ( non - resonance ) scattering phase shift at the real resonance relative momentum @xmath125 , @xmath126 represents the partial width of the excited state of @xmath25 mentioned above , and @xmath127 is the sommerfeld parameter",

    "<S> the @xmath0 reaction is considered to be the main neutron source responsible for the production of heavy nuclides ( from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) through slow @xmath3-capture nucleosynthesis ( @xmath4-process ) at low temperatures during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of low mass stars ( @xmath5 , or lmss ) . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , several direct and indirect measurements have been carried out to determine the cross section at the energies of astrophysical interest ( around @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , they yield inconsistent results causing a highly uncertain reaction rate and affecting the neutron release in lmss . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we have combined two indirect approaches , the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( or anc ) and the trojan horse method ( thm ) , to unambiguously determine the absolute value of the @xmath0 astrophysical factor . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have determined a very accurate reaction rate to be introduced into astrophysical models of @xmath4-process nucleosynthesis in lmss . </S>",
    "<S> calculations using such recommended rate have shown limited variations in the production of those neutron - rich nuclei ( with @xmath7 ) receiving contribution only by slow neutron captures . </S>"
