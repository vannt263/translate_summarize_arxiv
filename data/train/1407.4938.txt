    "superconducting qubits ( sqs ) constitute one of the leading candidate systems for realization of quantum computation @xcite . through the circuit resonators ,",

    "requires linking distant cqed systems to form a quantum network .",
    "microwave photons are sensitive to thermal noise and their quantum states only survive under cryogenic temperature .",
    "so it is hard to use them to link sqs in two different setups .",
    "optical photons , on the other hand , are robust information carriers at room temperature and serve as ideal flying qubits for long - distance communication .",
    "they can carry quantum information to distant locations through an optical fiber .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme to realize a quantum network of sqs through an opto - mechanical interface that couples optical photons in a cavity to microwave photons and sqs in a circuit resonator .",
    "the interface generates entangled states between sqs and photonic pulses with tunable pulse shape and carrier frequency .",
    "the photons then make a quantum link between distant sqs through either a measurement - based entangling protocol or a deterministic state mapping . because of the tunability of shape and frequency of the emitted photon",

    "a hybrid network may allow combination of advantages of different kinds of qubits .",
    "for instance , sqs may be good for fast information processing while atomic qubits are ideal for quantum memory .",
    "our scheme is based on the recent advance on the microwave - optical interface : there have been several proposals to realize this interface with ions @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , or a hybrid opto - mechanical system with superconducting resonators @xcite , or with flux qubit @xcite . in particular , a recent experiment has demonstrated the transducer between microwave and optical photons using the opto - mechanical system at @xmath3k temperature @xcite .",
    "one hassle for an interface between sqs and optical photons is that thermal initialization of the sqs requires an operating temperature around @xmath1 mk in a dilution fringe , while an interface to photons requires an optical window , which introduces heating due to black - body radiation and may significantly increase the system temperature .",

    "this ability is critical for building up a quantum network of sqs or a hybrid network between sqs and other matter qubits . here",
    ", we mention two complementary schemes for quantum networking of sqs , requiring different kinds of pulse shape control .",
    "the key requirement of quantum networking is to generate entanglement between remote sqs . the first scheme for entanglement generation",
    "is based on a deterministic quantum state transfer between sqs in two remote cavities @xcite .",
    "as absorption is the time reversal of the emission process , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that an emitted single - photon pulse can be completely absorbed by a matter qubit in a cavity if we simultaneously reverse the temporal shape of the photon pulse and the driving filed @xmath54 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2 , with an appropriate control of the driving microwave field @xmath54 , we can transfer a quantum state from a sq to a single - photon pulse with a symmetric temporal shape . this single - photon pulse , after propagation in an optical fiber , can then be absorbed by a sq in another remote cavity , if the driving @xmath92 of the second sq is the time reversal of @xmath54 .",
    "the shape control of the driving microwave pulse @xmath54 or @xmath92 can be easily achieved through modulation by an arbitrary wave form generator .",
    "if we make a half transfer of the population from the first sq to the photonic pulse , the generated state between the sq and the output photon @xmath93 has the form @xmath94 .",
    "then , after absorption of the photon by the second sq , we generate an entangled state @xmath95 between two remote sqs , as required for quantum networking .        the entanglement between remote sqs can also be generated in a probabilistic fashion through detection of interference of the emitted photon(s ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , as shown in fig .",
    "4a , we have sqs in two remote cavities , each emitting a single - photon pulse with a small probability @xmath96 $ ] through an incomplete adiabatic passage from the state @xmath9 to @xmath7 .",
    "the emitted pulses , after propagation in optical channels , interfere at a @xmath97 beam splitter , with outputs detected by single - photon counters .",
    "if we register only one photon from these detectors , the two sqs are projected to an entangled state @xmath98 with a success probability proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "the unknown relative phase @xmath100 can be canceled during the detection process @xcite , or through the second round of entanglement generation by applying the same protocol again @xcite .",
    "compared with the deterministic scheme @xcite , this probabilistic scheme has a lower efficiency as the protocol needs to be repeated until one successfully registers a photon count , however , it is more robust to noise as the photon loss in the optical channels does not influence the fidelity of this scheme .",
    "a major challenge for quantum networking based on the photonic connection is to achieve the spectrum ( shape ) and frequency matching of the emitted photon pulses from different matter qubits . for solid - state qubits in particular ,",
    "the coupling parameters usually vary for different systems and it is hard to get identical qubits or coupling rates .",
    "a remarkable advantage of the scheme based on the opto - mechanical interface is that all the mismatches in frequencies or pulse shapes can be easily compensated through the driving fields .",
    "for instance , the scheme works perfectly well if the coupling or decay rates are different for different systems . as the pulse shape only depends on @xmath75 from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we can always get identical shapes as difference in the coupling rates can be easily compensated by the microwave driving amplitude @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , the output optical frequency is purely determined by the eigenmode structure of the optical cavity and not limited by the qubit parameters .",
    "so , depending on the frequency and shape of the driving field , we can have a quantum interface between the sq and the optical photon with widely tunable carrier frequency and shape , which can then interfere with the photons emitted by other kinds of matter qubits , such as trapped ions @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , or diamond nitrogen vacancy centers @xcite .",
    "the sq - opto - mechanical interface therefore can work as a quantum transducer to generate entanglement links between different types of matter qubits .",
    "this leads to a hybrid quantum network , with an example illustrated in fig .",
    "3(b ) , which has the important advantage to combine the particular strength of each kind of matter qubits .",
    "in the above analysis , we assume the sq couples dominantly to the output field of the optical cavity and neglect other dissipation channels .",
    "now we take into account all the other dissipation processes and calculate their effects on the fidelity of quantum interface . under the condition that the pulse duration @xmath57 , we can adiabatically eliminate all the modes @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) in the langevin equations ( 3 ) and arrive at the following decay equation for the sq ( see details in appendix [ appendixb ] ) : @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103/\\sqrt{\\gamma_{eff}}$ ] , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
