    "the energy spectrum of two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) in magnetic fields of arbitrary orientation is fairly well understood @xcite .",
    "most considerations follow a single - particle approach which is powerful to explain several of the experimentally observed features . for magnetic fields tilted with respect to the sample normal",
    "one finds that the landau splitting , which is proportional to the component of the field perpendicular to the 2deg can be tuned with respect to the zeeman splitting which is proportional to the total magnetic field .",
    "this is used in the so - called coincidence method @xcite where appearance and disappearance of minima in shubnikov - de haas oscillations ( sdh ) as a function of tilt angle is observed in magnetotransport experiments . the analysis in terms of a picture of non - interacting electrons",
    "has proven very powerful for the analysis of energy spectra in si - mosfets @xcite , inas - gasb superlattices @xcite , inas - gasb quantum wells @xcite , gaas - algaas heterostructures @xcite , gainas / inp heterostructures @xcite and si / sige heterostructures @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on inas - alsb quantum wells and extend preliminary studies on this material system @xcite .",
    "we present several features that are perfectly well explained in the existing single - particle picture , namely 1 . the appearance and disappearance of even- and odd - integer sdh minima as a function of tilt angle , 2 .",
    "a zeman splitting as large as five times the landau splitting for tilt angles around 87 , and 3 . a g - factor for inas of about 13 in agreement with considerations based on conduction band non - parabolicity @xcite .",
    "in contrast to straight forward expectations we find 4 .",
    "non - vanishing sdh minima for even - integer filling factors @xmath3 in the range of tilt angles and magnetic fields where these filling factors can be observed and 5 .",
    "a regime at low magnetic fields where even - integer filling factor sdh minima persist for all tilt angles , while the usual coincidence features occur at higher magnetic fields .",
    "these observations are discussed in view of other experiments @xcite and theoretical ideas based on exchange enhancement @xcite .",
    "all samples contained 15 nm wide inas quantum wells , confined by alsb or al@xmath4ga@xmath5sb @xmath6 barriers .",
    "the sample details are summarized in @xcite .",
    "our samples are of very high quality and have mobilities up to 84m@xmath7/vs . in this paper",
    "we focus on a sample with a gasb cap and a carrier density of @xmath8@xmath9 ( ucsb #  9503 - 18 ) .",
    "the samples were patterned into geometries suitable for transport experiments and equipped with ohmic contacts to the 2deg .",
    "the samples were mounted on a revolving stage in several cryostat environments .",
    "the angle @xmath10 is measured between the magnetic field orientation and the sample normal . for the data taken at t=1.7k and magnetic fields up to 8 t the revolving stage was computer controlled .",
    "consequently very dense data sets were obtained .",
    "we also measured the samples in a dilution refrigerator at sample temperatures down to 100 mk and magnetic fields up to 15 t as well as in a @xmath11he system with a base temperature of about 400mk and magnetic fields up to 28 t . because of the landau level broadening the temperature dependence of the sdh oscillations basically levels off below 1.7k .",
    "the difference in experimental resolution of the three setups is mostly determined by the respective measurement electronics .",
    "the results obtained on different samples depend on the carrier concentration .",
    "the filling factor is definded by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the electron density of the 2deg . for perpendicular fields ,",
    "i.e. @xmath14 , all observed features at magnetic fields @xmath15 t , where the zeeman splitting is not yet resolved , can be analyzed with one single sdh period with very high accuracy @xcite .",
    "effects of inversion asymmetry induced zero - field spin - splitting @xcite are therefore not considered . from the largest filling factors that we can observe we",
    "estimate the landau level width to about 0.4mev .",
    "we can follow the disappearance and reappearance of minima at even- and odd - integer filling factors as a function of increasing tilt angle .",
    "this interplay between pronounced even- and odd - integer filling factor minima occurs for a series of angles .",
    "it also shows up in the respective quantum hall plateaus @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows magnetoresistance traces at specific tilt angles where either sdh minima occur only at even - integer filling factors , at even and odd , or only at odd integer filling factors .",
    "the amplitude of the sdh oscillations at large tilt angles is magnified with respect to the other traces .",
    "the angles are determined by measuring @xmath16 with high accuracy . the absolute error in the angle becomes larger with increasing tilt angle because of the @xmath17-dependence .",
    "we find that the carrier density decreases by up to 5% if parallel magnetic fields",
    "larger than 20 t are applied .",
    "this also shows up in a non - linear hall effect for large parallel fields .",
    "we attribute this behavior to magnetic freeze - out of carriers due to a redistribution of the electrons from the well into some localized states .",
    "the reason for this could be a strong diamagnetic shift of the quantum well state .",
    "this effect has no consequences for the results presented in this paper but explains why the sdh minima in fig .  2 for large tilt angles @xmath10 do not exactly fall onto the dashed lines .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "2 describes the various coincidence situations which are characterized by the parameter @xmath18 , the ratio of zeeman and cyclotron energies .",
    "@xmath19 here @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the effective electron mass , @xmath22 is the bohr magneton and @xmath23 .",
    "we thus arrive at @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the free electron mass . the data in fig .",
    "1 shows the resistance traces at @xmath18-values always close to the indicated numbers of 1/2 , 1 , 3/2,  .",
    "the larger the tilt angle , the more difficult it is to realize a given coincidence situation accurately since the span of angles at which it takes place decreases with @xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless we demonstrate that sdh oscillations can be measured in a situation where the zeeman splitting is 5 times larger than the landau splitting .",
    "figure  2 shows the coincidence situations plotted as @xmath27 versus @xmath18 .",
    "the slope of this curve is proportional to the product @xmath28 .",
    "we determined the effective mass for this sample by temperature dependent sdh measurements and found a value for the effective mass of @xmath29 which is in agreement with values reported in the literature . using this value for @xmath21",
    "we computed @xmath1 .",
    "such experiments have been performed on a series of samples . in first approximation",
    "the obtained data can be described by using landau levels and spin levels behaving and crossing as expected in a single - particle model . because the @xmath0-factor is so large effects of electron - electron interactions , the so - called exchange enhancement @xcite , are expected to be relatively small .",
    "furthermore these effects should increase for decreasing filling factors . in our case",
    "the experimental data can best be described with a product @xmath28 which is constant over the investigated range of magnetic fields and angles .",
    "the effects of non - parabolicity can be estimated using a @xmath30 formalism @xcite which in its simplest case reduces to the two - band model .",
    "@xmath31    here @xmath32mev is the band gap of inas and @xmath33 is the electron energy relative to the conduction band edge . because of the huge conduction band offset between inas and alsb ( 1.35ev ) , we use the model of a quantum well with infintely high walls .",
    "the total energy @xmath33 can , to a good approximation , be written as the sum of an approximate fermi energy @xmath34 and an approximate confinement energy @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the quantum well width . with this",
    "we obtain for the density dependence of the effective mass in the two - band model @xmath37 here @xmath38 , i.e. the effective mass at the conduction band edge , which for inas is @xmath39 .",
    "we find @xmath40@xmath41 in agreement with our experimentally determined value .",
    "the values for the energies are @xmath42mev and @xmath43mev .    at the same time",
    "the @xmath0-factor is reduced @xcite in agreement with our experimental findings . for the @xmath0-factor the two - band model results in    @xmath44    the parameter @xmath10 is estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite to be @xmath451/mev for a quantum well system very similar to ours .",
    "this results in a @xmath0-factor of @xmath46 very close to our experimental result .",
    "using the expressions for the @xmath0-factor and the effective mass one finds that the total effect of nonparabolicity on the product @xmath28 almost cancels out .",
    "several additional aspects should be considered in this discussion . for",
    "large tilt angles the in - plane magnetic field component can be as large as 10 t . in this case",
    "it is well known that the fermi surface is no longer a circle but an ellipse .",
    "the effective mass thus depends on @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "we measured the temperature dependence of the sdh oscillations in tilted magnetic fields in order to extract the effective mass as a function of field and tilt angle . within the experimental accuracy we found that the effective mass is constant to 5% in the investigated parameter regime . on the same footing",
    "one also expects that the @xmath0-factor becomes a magnetic field dependent quantity . with these complications in mind one",
    "has to take the analysis of the product @xmath28 from the plot in fig .  2 with a grain of salt .",
    "figure  3 shows magnetoresistance traces down to even - integer filling factors of @xmath48 .",
    "we only present the range of angles where the situation corresponding to @xmath49 occurs . the tilt angle is changed in rather small increments which are monitored by the change in the hall resistance @xmath16 .",
    "similar but less pronounced features alos occur in a sample has a lower carrier density of @xmath50@xmath9 .",
    "the highest perpendicular magnetic fields correspond to total magnetic fields of 28 t . for @xmath51 ,",
    "minima occur for even- and odd - integer filling factors .",
    "as the tilt angle increases , even - integer minima weaken until about @xmath52 and then increase again in strength .",
    "they never completely disappear even up to filling factors of @xmath53=16 .",
    "this means that there always remains a minimum of the density of states at the fermi energy when the single - particle model predicts a crossing of spin and landau levels .",
    "an anti - crossing of single particle levels has been predicted for filling factor @xmath54 @xcite based on the transition from a spin - unpolarized state at small tilt angles to a spin polarized state at large tilt angles .",
    "experimental data obtained on gainas / inp heterostructures @xcite showed the expected single particle behavior for low - mobility samples while a non - suppression of the sdh minimum at @xmath54 for high - mobility samples was observed .",
    "this was interpreted in the framework of the formation of a spin - polarized ground state @xcite induced by the strong parallel magnetic field . in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite the sdh minimum corresponding to filling factor @xmath55 and higher even - integer filling factors were perfectly well suppressed at the same tilt angle as expected in a single particle model .",
    "the authors @xcite argued that for low mobility samples and higher integer filling factors neighboring levels overlap due to their broadening and the exchange interaction can not help to further open the gap .",
    "the experimental situation in our case is different in the following aspects .",
    "the sdh minima at even - integer filling factors weaken but do not disappear .",
    "furthermore their weaking goes hand in hand with their overall appearance , i.e.  the sudden importance of an exchange driven opening of a gap can not be observed . unfortunately the carrier density in our samples is too high to observe the behavior of sdh minima corresponding to filling factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 at large tilt angles and experimentally accessible magnetic fields .    in order to get an understanding of the energy struture in tilted magnetic fields we calculated the magnetoresistance following gerhardts @xcite .",
    "we included a constant background density of states in order to model the broad minima in the magnetoresistance .",
    "based on the single particle energies @xmath56 an anti - crossing between neighboring levels of @xmath57 was inserted in the model . at @xmath58=4.2 t ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath59",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath60mev .",
    "we assumed a gaussian landau level broadening @xmath61mev with @xmath62ps .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the anti - crossing was approximated with a smooth parabolic curvature .",
    "figure  4 shows calculated resistance traces .",
    "there is at least qualitative agreement between the calculated ( fig .  4 ) and experimental ( fig .",
    "3 ) data sets . from the simulation",
    "it is obvious that the situation where even - integer minima in the sdh oscillations are weakened or even suppressed extends over a significantly larger range of angles compared to the experiment .",
    "this could arise from our rough modelling but also hints at the importance of interaction effects for the details of sdh oscillations .    what could be the reason for the persistent appearance of even - integer sdh minima in the regime where the underlying single particle energy levels are expected to cross ? for small filling factors",
    "the effects of exchange enhancement @xcite have been demonstrated in various experiments ( for a recent example see @xcite and references therein ) . from our experimental data at small filling factors we do not see an indication that eletron - electron interactions in terms of exchange enhancement play a significant role .",
    "for the case of perpendicular magnetic fields , @xmath14 , the energy levels are described by three quantum numbers , namely subband , landau and spin quantum numbers .",
    "this is based on the fact that the hamiltonian can be separated into a part describing the electron motion in the plane of the 2deg and another part responsible for the quantization in growth direction . for tilted magnetic fields",
    "mixed levels arise whose degenracy is still completely controlled by the perpendicular magnetic field component @xcite . for the inas - alsb system",
    "this approach has to be extended in order to incorporate the strong conduction band non - parabolicity of inas , as well as the possible strain in the well due to the different lattice constants of barrier , well and gaas substrate .",
    "one can envision that such effects already lead to possible level couplings and anti - crossings as observed in the experiment .",
    "figure  5 presents a grey - scale plot composed of magnetoresistance traces taken at very closly spaced tilt angles around the regime of @xmath49 and @xmath63 . here",
    "we focus on the regime of small magnetic fields . for @xmath64 sdh minima occur at even - integer filling factors . as the tilt angle",
    "is increased , odd - integer minima take over at magnetic fields @xmath65 t and gradually disappear again in favor of even - integer minima . at magnetic fields below 0.8",
    "t minima occur only at even - integer filling factors over the whole range of tilt angles .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "5 shows a representative resistance trace at an intermediate tilt angle where the sdh oscillations are dominated by even - integer minima at low magnetic fields , a crossover regime and odd integer filling factors at higher magnetic fields .",
    "a beating pattern would not display such a phase shift in the pattern of the oscillations .",
    "starting from the landau and spin levels in tilted magnetic fields such a behavior can occur in two ways : either the landau energy is not exactly proportional to the perpendicular component of the magnetic field , or the zeeman splitting is angle dependent .",
    "both effects have been discussed to some extent before .",
    "non - parabolicity effects are most likely a minor contribution for such small magnetic fields .",
    "the large in - plane magnetic field component , which can lead to an anisotropic effective mass dispersion , should become more important for larger magnetic fields . however , the unusual behavior as presented in fig .",
    "5 occurs in the low - magnetic field regime .",
    "leadley et al .",
    "have shown that there is a critical collapse of the exchange enhanced spin splitting in two - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the total spin splitting is a sum of the bare zeeman splitting proportional to the total magnetic field and a contribution due to exchange enhancement which is proportional to the perpendicular component of the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath66    for the case of gaas heterostructures , leadley at al . found @xmath67 independent of magnetic field . in their case",
    "@xmath68 is the bare @xmath0-factor because non - parabolicity effects are negligible in gaas . in our case",
    "@xmath68 has to be identified with @xmath69 where the non - parabolicity contribution stems from the position of the fermi energy above the conduction band edge and does not depend on magnetic field in the investigated range of parameters .    in the regime of large magnetic fields",
    "discussed before , where spin splitting is well resolved , we found that the exchange enhancement is a minor contribution .",
    "however , for small magnetic fields and large tilt angles the exchange contribution could play an important role .",
    "if the bare spin splitting is smaller than the landau level broadening , the exchange enhancement is not expected to play a role . in this case",
    "even - integer sdh minima will dominate the magnetoresistance for all tilt angles .",
    "once the bare zeeman splitting approaches and exceeds the landau level broadening the exchange enhancement will further increase the spin gap and the usual coincidences between landau and spin levels will take over .    for any functional dependence of g on b which is smooth one would not expect a sudden crossover from even - integer to odd - integer minima as depcited in the inset of fig .",
    "5 . the sudden change in periodicity over a small magnetic field range requires a mechanism which leads to an abrupt opening of the spin gap similar as it has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the cititcal collapse of the exchange enhanced spin - splitting .",
    "we have presented a series of sdh measurements on inas - alsb quantum wells in tilted magnetic fields . in a reasonable range of parameters",
    "the experimental results can be understood in a straight forward single particle model .",
    "the coincidence method is based on independent landau and spin levels . this way we obtain reasonable numbers for the effective mass and g - factor that agree with results of a two - band model and experimental results of others . for large magnetic fields we find an anti - crossing of neighboring landau and spin levels .",
    "most likely this is not a consequence of electron - electron interactions .",
    "we speculate that this effect arises from the pronounced non - parabolicity of the inas conduction band as well as from the built - in strain in such samples .",
    "for very small magnetic fields sdh minima exist only at even - integer filling factors independent of tilt angle .",
    "this is attributed to a critical filling factor necessary for the observation of spin - splitting    we are grateful to r. warburton and s. ulloa for helpful discussions and thank eth zrich and quest for financial support .",
