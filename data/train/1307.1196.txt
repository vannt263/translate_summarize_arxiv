    "quantum entanglement is employed in most of quantum information processing tasks ( qipts ) including the quantum algorithms and the quantum communications [ 1 ] .",
    "there is no doubt that quantum entanglement is an important physical resource in quantum information processing .",
    "however , quantum entanglement can not be competent for all the qipts [ 2 - 5 ] .",
    "strong evidence has shown that some qipts display the quantum advantage , but there does not exist any entanglement in the tasks [ 6,7 ] , which is also verified in experiment [ 8 ] .",
    "one such remarkable evidence is the scheme of the deterministic quantum computing with one qubit ( dqc1 ) which accomplishes to evaluate the normalized trace of a unitary matrix by only measuring a control qubit , irrespective of the complexity of the unitary matrix of interests [ 9 ] .",
    "but dqc1 can not be performed effectively by only using classical computation [ 9,10 ] .",
    "so what quantum property leads to the quantum advantage in the dqc1 ?",
    "quantum discord was introduced to effectively distinguish the quantum from the classical correlations [ 11 - 13 ] .",
    "it is shown that quantum correlation ` includes ' quantum entanglement but beyond it due to the presence in separable states [ 14 - 16 ] . in recent years",
    ", quantum discord has attracted increasing interests especially in the areas such as the evolution in quantum dynamical system [ 17 - 19 ] , operational interpretations [ 20 - 26 ] and the quantification [ 27,28 ] and the experiments @xcite . in particular , it is found that almost every unitary matrix ( random unitary ) in the dqc1 will lead to the occurrence of quantum discord in the output state , so it is conjectured that quantum discord could be the quantum nature of the dqc1 [ 10 ] .",
    "however , after all , there exist some general unitary matrices ( for example , hermitian unitary matrices ) that will arrive at the output states without any quantum discord . in this sense",
    ", it seems that quantum discord should not be the source of the quantum advantage of the dqc1 either , as is first suspected in ref .",
    "thus what on earth is the quantum nature of dqc1 is still left open .    in this paper",
    ", we find that the trace calculation and the complexity in the dqc1 can be directly related to the entangling power which is defined by the maximal average on the ability to entangle a qubit with a pure state in a given ensemble .",
    "we find that the entangling power of the dqc1 circuit can be directly written as the normalized trace of the unitary transformation to be measured .",
    "based on this result , we find not only that in the nontrivial dqc1 is there the entangling power , but also that the intrinsic complexity ( which will be given at the end ) of the evaluation of the normalized trace is determined by the entangling power . in this sense",
    ", we say that the entangling power could be used to signal the quantum nature of the dqc1 . as a supplement",
    ", we also consider the other qipts using the similar dqc1 circuit .",
    "one will find that the entangling power is always present if the information of the system can be extracted by the control qubit .    ) . ]",
    "we begin with a brief introduction of the generalized dqc1 described by the quantum circuit given in fig . 1 [ 9 ] .",
    "the initial state can be written as @xmath0where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are pauli matrices , the subscript ` c ' denotes the control qubit , the superscript @xmath3 means that the density matrix depends on the parameter @xmath3 and @xmath4 means the identity of @xmath5 qubits .",
    "it is noted that in the standard dqc1 [ 7 ] , the initial control qubit is given by @xmath6 . through the quantum circuit , the state given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) will be transformed into the final state @xmath7 , @xmath8thus if we measure the control qubit in the basis of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , one can obtain the corresponding expectations as @xmath11re(tr@xmath12 ) and @xmath13im(tr@xmath12 ) . in this way",
    ", the normalized trace of the unitary matrix @xmath12 is obtained only by the measurements on a single qubit , irrespective of the complexity of the unitary matrix .",
    "this shows the quantum advantage of the dqc1 in the reduction of the computational complexity .    in this task ,",
    "the initial state @xmath14 is obviously mixed , so in practical scenario , it has to be prepared by one of its pure - state realizations @xmath15 such that @xmath16 , @xmath17where @xmath18 is normalized but not necessarily orthogonal .",
    "an intuitive observation shows that the dqc1 circuit can lead to the entangled final state of @xmath19 if any information on @xmath12 is unknown .",
    "therefore , it is not difficult to ignite the light to relate this kind of entanglement to the mechanism of the quantum advantage of the dqc1 .",
    "to do so , we would like to introduce the variational concept of entangling power .",
    "it is initially defined for a unitary transformation by measuring the average entanglement produced by this unitary transformation on the separable state subject to some kind of distributions @xcite . however , in some special qipts , not all the quantum separable states are covered , so it is necessary to give an explicit definition well - suited to the given qipt .",
    "so in the dqc1 , we would like to consider the entangling power of the controlled unitary transformation @xmath20 with the assistance of the hadamard gate @xmath21 subject to the initial ensemble @xmath22 . in other words",
    ", we will quantify the ability of the whole dqc1 circuit to entangle the control qubit with the @xmath5-qubit pure state selected from the initial ensemble @xmath22 . with this aim",
    ", we have the following rigid definition .",
    "* definition*.- the entangling power of the dqc1 circuit is given by@xmath23\\]]with @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 $ ] represents any a good entanglement measure [ 1 ] .",
    "here we let @xmath26 = \\sqrt{2\\left ( 1-\\text{tr}\\rho _ { r}^{2}\\right ) } $ ] with @xmath27 the reduced density matrix of the state taken into account [ 1 ] .",
    "the maximum is taken due to the non - uniqueness of the realization of @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , @xmath28 is not limited to the pure state , which is different from the original definition of the entangling power besides the limited ensemble .",
    "next , we will give our main results on @xmath29 by two theorems .",
    "* theorem 1.*-the entangling power , defined in eq .",
    "( 3 ) for the standard dqc1 circuit corresponding to @xmath30i.e . , @xmath31 , is given by @xmath32**proof .",
    "* * substitute @xmath33 and any an @xmath5-partite pure state @xmath34chosen from the ensemble @xmath35 into the dqc1 circuit sketched in fig .",
    "1 , the final state after these substitutions can be written as    @xmath36    the reduced density matrix by tracing out the control qubit is given by@xmath37so the entangling power can be expressed as@xmath38the inequality comes from the concave property of the entanglement measure @xmath39 $ ] and the maximum is attained by the realization @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 the eigenvectors of @xmath12 .",
    "the proof is completed.@xmath44    it is quite interesting that the entangling power for the standard dqc1 is directly described by the normalized trace of the measured @xmath12 .",
    "so long as tr@xmath45 which implies @xmath46 , the entangling power will not vanish .",
    "this means that the dqc1 will demonstrate the quantum advantage .",
    "otherwise , the entangling power will vanish for @xmath47 , but the unitary matrix @xmath12 in this case will be easily evaluated in the classical computation .",
    "so it is a trivial case .    *",
    "theorem 2.*-the entangling power for the generalized dqc1 circuit corresponding to @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath49 , is given by @xmath50**proof .",
    "* * if @xmath49 , the control qubit is obviously a mixed state .",
    "based on the definition of entangling power given in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we can write @xmath51 , \\]]with @xmath52since @xmath53 $ ] denotes the entanglement measure of the state @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 = \\min_{\\left\\ { r_{j},\\left\\vert \\gamma _ { j}\\right\\rangle \\right\\ } } \\sum_{j}r_{j}e_{i}\\left [ \\left\\vert \\gamma _ { j}\\right\\rangle \\right ] , \\]]with @xmath56 and the subscript @xmath57 corresponding to @xmath54 . thus the entangling power can be rewritten as@xmath58",
    "\\notag \\\\ & = & \\min_{\\left\\ { r_{j},\\left\\vert \\gamma _ { j}\\right\\rangle \\right\\ } } \\max_{\\left\\ { q_{i},\\left\\vert \\varphi _ { i}\\right\\rangle \\right\\ } } \\sum\\limits_{ij}q_{i}r_{j}e_{i}\\left [ \\left\\vert \\gamma _ { j}\\right\\rangle % \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\]]where the exchange of the maximum and minimum is attributed to the independence of realizations @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "consider the eigendecomposition of @xmath61 : @xmath62 , one can obtain that @xmath63thus any decomposition of @xmath54 can be given in terms of the eigendecomposition characterized by eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 15 ) .",
    "let @xmath64 be one decomposition with the form of matrix given by @xmath65 where the columns of @xmath66 correspond to @xmath67 and the diagonal entries of the diagonal matrix @xmath68 correspond to @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes a right unitary matrix with @xmath72 .",
    "so @xmath67 can be given by the eigenvectors as @xmath73where @xmath74and @xmath75 with @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78substitute eq .",
    "( 16 ) into eq .",
    "( 13 ) , we can arrive at    @xmath79    based on eq .",
    "( 7 ) ( or theorem 1 ) , we have @xmath80insert eqs . ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) into eq .",
    "( 21 ) and use eq .",
    "( 19 ) , it follows@xmath81 e_{p}^{1}\\left ( \\tilde{u}_{n}\\right )   \\notag \\\\ & = & \\alpha e_{p}^{1}\\left ( \\tilde{u}_{n}\\right ) = \\alpha \\sqrt{1-\\left\\vert   \\frac{\\text{tr}u_{n}}{2^{n}}\\right\\vert ^{2}}\\end{aligned}\\]]where the minimum is achieved when both @xmath82 and @xmath83 are real or imaginary for all @xmath84 .",
    "the proof is completed.@xmath44    from the above two theorems , one can find the result given in theorem 2 can be reduced to theorem 1 for @xmath31 .",
    "that is , the entangling power @xmath85 pertains to all the cases of @xmath86 .",
    "in addition , the entangling power of the generalized dqc1 including the standard case is directly described by the normalized trace of @xmath12 to be measured . as is the same as the analysis of the standard dqc1 , if @xmath46 which is a trivial case , the dqc1 will demonstrate the quantum advantage of the quantum computation , the entangling power will not vanish .",
    "in addition , it can be easily found that the entangling power will increase as @xmath3 increasing .",
    "when @xmath87 , this means that the control qubit is an identity which will extract nothing about the measured @xmath12 . in this case , the entangling power vanishes , which is consistent with our expectation .",
    "in fact , our entangling power is also closely related to the complexity of the dqc1 .",
    "the complexity of the dqc1 can be given by @xmath88where @xmath89 is the measurement complexity which describes how many rounds of measurements are necessary to be operated on the control qubit for a given standard deviation @xmath90 , and @xmath5 is the input complexity which denotes the number of qubits needed to be input into the dqc1 circuit . in usual analysis of the complexity of dqc1 , only the measurement complexity @xmath89 is considered .",
    "so it is stated that the complexity @xmath89 only depends on the accuracy @xmath90 that we expect instead of the scale of the measured @xmath12 , because@xmath91where @xmath92 is the probability that the estimate is farther from the true value than @xmath90 [ 10 ] .",
    "when we consider the practical experiment , the standard deviation should not exceed the true value of the measured quantity . in this sense ,",
    "the complexity will also depend on the true value of the measured observables to different extents .",
    "thus , instead of the standard deviation @xmath90 , it would be reasonable to describe the accuracy in terms of the relative error defined by @xmath93with @xmath94 the true value of some measured quantities . in the dqc1 , @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "will be measured on the control qubit corresponding to the normalized trace of @xmath12 ( actually to the real and imaginary parts , respectively ) .",
    "let our finally expecting relative errors be @xmath97 with @xmath98 and @xmath99 denoting the expecting relative errors for the measurements @xmath9 and @xmath96 such that @xmath100 } { \\left\\vert \\epsilon ( \\sigma _ { x})\\text{re}\\left ( \\frac{\\text{tr}u_{n}}{2^{n}}\\right ) \\right\\vert ^{2}}=% \\frac{\\ln \\left [ 1/p_{e}(\\sigma _ { y})\\right ] } { \\left\\vert \\epsilon ( \\sigma _ { y})\\text{im}\\left ( \\frac{\\text{tr}u_{n}}{2^{n}}\\right ) \\right\\vert ^{2}}% \\thicksim \\alpha ^{2}l.\\]]substitute eqs .",
    "( 24 - 26 ) into eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the entangling power can be written as@xmath101with @xmath102 } { \\left\\vert \\epsilon ( \\sigma _ { x})\\right\\vert ^{2}}+\\frac{\\ln \\left [ 1/p_{e}(\\sigma _ { y})\\right ]   } { \\left\\vert \\epsilon ( \\sigma _ { y})\\right\\vert ^{2}}$ ] .",
    "thus for a given @xmath103 , the measurement complexity @xmath104 is directly determined by the entangling power @xmath105 . since @xmath103 is determined by the expecting errors and",
    "is independent of the scale of the measured @xmath106 , we think that the complexity @xmath104 with the fixed @xmath103 is the intrinsic complexity .",
    "the larger entangling power means the larger intrinsic complexly @xmath104 .",
    "thus one can find that the intrinsic complexity is directly determined by the entangling power .",
    "we would like to generalize the current dqc1 circuit to general qipts , by which one will find that the non - trivial tasks with dqc1 circuit are indeed accompanied with non - vanishing entangling power .",
    "suppose this circuit is used to extract the information of some state @xmath107 instead of @xmath4 and the control qubit is the general quantum state@xmath108 with @xmath109 the polarization vector and @xmath110 the corresponding vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the final state @xmath111 of @xmath112 via the circuit can be written as @xmath113 tr@xmath114 .",
    "the linear entropy of @xmath111 is given by @xmath115 in order to accomplish this extraction of information , @xmath116 should include at least the information on the state @xmath107 or the unitary operation @xmath12 based on different aims , since one hopes to extract the information by the control qubit .",
    "that is , @xmath116 should not vanish . in this case , we can obtain the similar theorem as theorem 1 and theorem 2 .",
    "* theorem 3 .",
    "* let the entangling power of the dqc1 circuit subject to @xmath117 be @xmath118 , @xmath119 does not vanish for @xmath120 ; @xmath121and @xmath122where the superscript @xmath123 means @xmath124 , the superscript @xmath109 is the general case in @xmath28 and @xmath125 are the square root of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath126 in decreasing order .",
    "* proof . *",
    "the proof is quite similar to that of theorem 2 .",
    "the details are given in the appendix .",
    "one can easily check that theorem 1 and theorem 2 are covered in this theorem .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the normalized trace of the unitary transformation @xmath12 can be directly described by the entangling power of the circuit of the dqc1 .",
    "in addition , the entangling power also determines the intrinsic complexity of the evaluation of the normalized trace of the measured unitary matrix . in this sense",
    ", we think that the entangling power could be the signature of the quantum advantage of the dqc1 .",
    "furthermore , we also present a generalization of the current dqc1 circuit to other qipts .",
    "we find that the entangling power will not vanish if the information can be extracted by the control qubit .",
