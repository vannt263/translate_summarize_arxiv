    "the presence in the hadron spectrum of mesons consisting of two  @xmath5 s and two  @xmath6 s  @xcite as well as of baryons consisting of  @xmath7 and a  @xmath6 has been considered since many years  @xcite .    a long time ago jaffe proposed that the lightest scalar states , @xmath8 , @xmath9 together with the rest of their nonet , should be interpreted as  @xmath10 states  @xcite .",
    "the simplifying assumption  @xcite of considering only  @xmath11 pairs transforming as a ( @xmath12 ) representation of @xmath13 , straitens the whole spectrum to the lightest scalar nonet , namely @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 as built with a pair of such a diquark and anti - diquark  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation was recently enforced by experiments confirming the presence of hidden strangeness in both the states @xmath17 and @xmath18  @xcite , promoting the tetraquarks to a more solid status .",
    "candidates with open or hidden charm come from the study of non - leptonic b decays at babar and belle , as anticipated in  @xcite , and from bes .    in this paper",
    "we study the spectrum of the states consisting of three quarks and three antiquarks in s - wave , interacting via chromo - magnetism .",
    "besides strangeness we include also charm and assume for chromo - magnetism its full content  @xcite , treated along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it happens that this hypothesis can successfully interpret some observed baryon - antibaryon negative parity states in  @xmath19  @xcite , @xmath20  @xcite and @xmath21  @xcite , assuming for the parameters ( constituent masses and effective couplings ) those values obtained from the tetraquarks phenomenology . to study the case of broken flavor symmetry we had to resort to machine computation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  i we introduce the basics of chromo - magnetism with a formulation more suitable for algebraic computation . section  ii deals with the formalism for the construction of the tetraquarks states and the study of the open door decays . in section",
    "iii , iv and v we discuss the phenomenology of tetraquarks states and the parameter fixing of the model .",
    "hexaquark states are introduced in sections  vi along with the details entering the calculation . in section",
    "vii we present the results we found for the spectrum and compare them with the relevant experimental data .",
    "section  viii contains our conclusions .",
    "finally , the appendix  a contains a table with the full spectrum of the baryon - antibaryon systems that were taken under consideration , while in appendix  b the crossing matrices required for the study of the decays of tetraquarks are reported .",
    "the matrix elements of the chromo - magnetic operator are given , for all cases , in appendix  c.",
    "the hyperfine interaction arising from one gluon exchange between constituents leads to a simple hamiltonian involving the color and spin degrees of freedom : @xmath22 the index @xmath23 refers to the @xmath24th ( @xmath25th ) quark , @xmath26 its mass and @xmath27 appropriate coupling constants .",
    "the kinetic energy is absorbed in the mass term , so it is not surprise that the quarks masses depend on the system under consideration .",
    "the @xmath27 s depend not only on the @xmath26 s ( as @xmath28 ) but also on the wave function at zero distance of the pair @xmath29 , so depending on the system as well .",
    "chromo - magnetism ( cm ) is encoded in @xmath30 , the two particles chromo - magnetic operator , which is given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the gell - mann matrices and @xmath33 the pauli matrices .",
    "it is reminiscent of the well known exchange interaction and can be expressed in terms of permutation operators for color and spin @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the action on a @xmath35 quark - quark ( antiquark - antiquark ) pair is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 exchange the colors and spins ( acting independently ) , of the pair @xmath39 .",
    "eigenvectors of  [ eq : permt ] are the diquark states of definite symmetry in color and spin @xmath40 with eigenvalues @xmath41 respectively .    to express the result for a quark - antiquark pair it is useful to define a generic @xmath42 for the group @xmath43 as the object : @xmath44 , with @xmath45 in the representation @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the c.c .",
    "representation @xmath48 . making the identification @xmath49 for @xmath50and@xmath51 for @xmath52",
    "we can write quite simply:@xmath53 the eigenvectors of @xmath42 are the singlet representation ( @xmath54 ) with eigenvalue ( @xmath55 ) and the adjoint representation ( @xmath56 ) with eigenvalue @xmath57 .",
    "so eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the chromo - magnetic operator in the present case are : @xmath58 with eigenvalues @xmath59 respectively .    by far",
    "the more bonded diquark is the @xmath60 whose @xmath61 flavor content , as dictated by the pauli principle , is @xmath62 .",
    "this is the so called good diquark , it transforms as a scalar antiquark .",
    "if one assumes the hypothesis of jaffe and wilczek  @xcite , the spectrum of the tetraquarks remains restricted to the scalar nonet suggested by jaffe a long time ago .",
    "the vector , or bad diquark @xmath63 , allows for higher spin states but , since it is a @xmath64 it also introduces exotics , i.e. multiplets higher than @xmath61 nonets and are excluded from most models .",
    "the other two @xmath65 states , that jaffe  @xcite called sometimes `` worse '' are not in general taken into account neither .    in the present approach in searching for the eigenstates of the chromo - magnetic operator we do not truncate the space in any way , such that , in some sense , all four possible diquarks enter the game .    it is easy to see that we have the following spin - flavor multiplets : spin  0 has four nonets and two @xmath66 s , spin  1 has two nonets , four octets , one @xmath66 , two decuplets and two antidecuplets , finally spin  2 has two nonets and one @xmath66 .",
    "exotics , as @xmath67 states , are not excluded a priori but we think that these states are much less stable and difficult to be observed .",
    "often , we have found a number of near threshold decays , usually attributed as molecular states , that are well described by chromo - magnetism .",
    "in particular the introduction of the @xmath68 diquark encompass the dichotomy between diquark and molecular models as clearly argued in  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the molecular state is not an independent state , but is a linear combination of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the later @xmath68 , by the way , is the only other diquark with negative chromo - magnetic energy ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "their observation indicates that a minimal diquark model should include both pairs , and interestingly enough , it would comprise all spin cases as s - wave tetraquarks lying in only @xmath61 nonets . from the point of view of @xmath72",
    "this means that a diquark should transform as the symmetric representation , @xmath73 ( so as @xmath62 ) .",
    "a purely phenomenological motivation to include the @xmath68 diquark is that the mass of the @xmath74 pair , say @xmath75 , is related to the mass of the @xmath76 hyperon by the relation  : @xmath77 , which for a state consisting of two of these objects which have no mutual chromo - magnetic interaction imply about twice the mass of the @xmath14 .",
    "instead , by considering the vector space consisting of both the @xmath78 and @xmath79 color singlet states , the lightest state has a binding energy about @xmath80 times larger than the diagonal matrix element for @xmath81  @xcite .    in the flavor symmetry limit ,",
    "i.e. when the couplings @xmath82 are all equal to each other , it is well known that @xmath83 can be expressed as a combination of casimirs .",
    "this fact has been extensively exploited in the pioneering works of jaffe  @xcite and in many other works  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we shall attack the more complicated issue of considering different masses and couplings , in most of such cases we have to rely on symbolic manipulations that we performed with form  @xcite .",
    "the expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : permt ] ) and ( [ eq : tt ] ) result quite suitable for computer implementation .",
    "it has been observed for the first time by jaffe  @xcite that @xmath10 mesons may decay into two ordinary ( i.e. color singlet ) mesons pp , pv , vv ( p stands for a pseudoscalar and v for a vector ) by simply separating from each other , as long as it is kinematically allowed .",
    "he called these channels `` open door '' or `` ozi super - allowed '' decays , since they can occur without gluon exchange or quark annihilation . in open door channels ,",
    "s - wave states have to decay into s - wave mesons with zero relative angular momentum .    in general calculations",
    "are performed in the diquark - antidiquark basis , i.e. the tetraquark is represented as @xmath84 denoted  * [ 12,34 ] * in the following .",
    "evidently the diquark and the antidiquark can not separate from each other as they can never be color singlets .",
    "so , in order to access the open door channels it is convenient to pass to the meson - meson basis * [ 13,24 ] * and * [ 14,23 ] * which , obviously , coincide if antiquarks 3 and 4 have the same flavor .    in order to have some uniformity in the conventions ,",
    "we maintain those of  @xcite .",
    "we call the basis for spin  0 : as @xmath85 in * [ 12,34 ] * , @xmath86 in * [ 13,24 ] * and @xmath87 in * [ 14,23 ] * , in the same order one has @xmath88 and @xmath89 for spin 1 , while those of spin 2 are called @xmath90 and @xmath91 . to characterize each basis , we have only to specify the color - spin content of the first and second pairs in the brackets , which combine to form the color singlets i.e. the set of physical states .",
    "* spin 0 *    [ cols= \" > , < , < \" , ]     @xmath92",
    "we have computed the matrices of chromo - magnetism by inserting the operator eq .",
    "[ eq : hcm ] between the states at eqs .",
