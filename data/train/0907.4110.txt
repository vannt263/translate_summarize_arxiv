    "experimentalists and theorists alike have long considered the possibility that matter and antimatter fall differently in the gravitational field of the earth ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "early experimental endeavors began with fairbank , who attempted to measure the differential free fall acceleration of electrons and positrons .",
    "these efforts , however , did not result in any conclusive measurement because of the extreme difficulty of isolating the test particles from stray electric fields .",
    "recently an experiment has been proposed at fermilab that aims to directly measure the free fall acceleration of antihydrogen in the field of the earth , @xmath1 , with an expected precision of 1% or better @xcite .",
    "likewise , another experiment ( aegis @xcite ) to measure @xmath1 has been proposed at cern . in light of these experimental proposals , it is only reasonable to consider what sort of bounds existing experiments place on the inequality of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "although some of the arguments we make can be found elsewhere in the literature , we include them here to stress the point that existing experiments already place stringent bounds on any gravitational asymmetry between matter and antimatter .",
    "there are two broad classes of theoretical possibilities for how gravitational asymmetry might be realized .",
    "the first is a modification of general relativity itself .",
    "any such theory in which matter and antimatter gravitate differently will necessarily do violence to fundamental principles of general relativity and quantum field theory .",
    "as such , we are not aware of any concrete , self - consistent theoretical formulation  whether well - motivated or not  in which such an asymmetry exists .",
    "nevertheless , we can still establish bounds on any such asymmetry , since existing experiments already tell us something about how antimatter gravitates .",
    "this will be the subject of section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "the essential point is that the composite nature of atoms implies that precision etvs experiments , which have been done with a variety of elements , are sensitive to the gravitational coupling of antimatter .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:3 ]    the above considerations are just one of the many effects that contribute to the renormalization of the effective scalar and vector charges of atoms .",
    "the implication of these effects is that even if cancellation could be achieved at the level of electrons , protons , and neutrons , that cancellation would necessarily be undone as one descends to the ( relevant ) effective theory in which atoms are the degrees of freedom . as a consequence composition dependence is generic in the scalar - vector scenario .",
    "the discussion in this paper was motivated by recent experimental proposals to test for violations of the equivalence principle in the free fall acceleration of antihydrogen in the gravitational field of the earth .",
    "focusing our attention on two different scenarios for how such gravitational asymmetry between matter and antimatter might be realized , we established a number of strict bounds , which are collected in table [ tab:3 ] .",

    "<S> , we show that the radiative damping of binary pulsar systems constrains these forces to be significantly weaker than gravity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we show that there are limits to the accuracy with which such cancellation can be arranged : first by determining the precision to which scalar charges can track vector charges in the best candidate theories ; and , second , by showing that the different velocity dependence of scalar and vector forces necessarily introduces non - cancellation at a quantifiable level . </S>"
