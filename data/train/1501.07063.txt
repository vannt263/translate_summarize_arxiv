    "massive stars , when evolving off the main sequence , undergo phases of strong mass - loss , often resulting in the formation of shells , disks or rings of circumstellar material .",
    "one class of evolved massive stars , b[e ] supergiants ( b[e]sgs ) , are early - type emission line stars with high - density gaseous and dusty circumstellar disks of yet unknown origin ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "the gaseous inner disk is traced by the emission of low - ionized metal lines from both permitted and forbidden transitions . of these , the lines of [ caii ] and [ oi ] are particularly useful . while their intensities probe regions of high and medium densities , where the transition between the two regimes might be settled at an electron density of @xmath1@xmath2 , their line profiles contain the information on their kinematics .",
    "farther out , molecules form via gas phase chemistry , and intense band emission from co molecules has been reported for many of these stars .",
    "in addition , the presence of tio band emission features in optical spectra of several b[e]sgs has been suggested , but still lacks confirmation . besides atomic and molecular gas",
    ", these stars are also surrounded by warm circumstellar dust , as is obvious from their strong infrared excess emission , interferometric observations , and resolved spectral dust features @xcite .",
    "kinematic studies of the atomic and co gas reveal that the material is confined to detached ( sometimes multiple ) rings rotating around the star on keplerian orbits .",
    "abundance studies of these rings reveal an enrichment in the isotopic molecule @xmath3co , in agreement with an evolutionary stage just beyond the main sequence .",
    "furthermore , b[e]sgs could be the progenitors of a group of early - type blue supergiants ( bsgs ) with ring nebulae such as , e.g. , sher25 and sbw1 .",
    "optical images of these two stars display equatorial rings and bipolar lobes , and @xcite propose that as soon as the rings or disk - like structures seen around b[e]sgs have expanded and cooled they would look exactly like these objects .",
    "support for such a possible evolutionary link comes from the fact that , like b[e]sgs , neither sher25 nor sbw1 has evolved yet through a red supergiant phase , indicating that in both cases , the ejection of the material forming the disks or rings must have happened during their bsg phase .",
    "such a scenario has a much wider impact : as the bsgs with rings closely resemble the progenitor star of the supernova sn 1987a , b[e]sgs might be regarded as the most plausible candidates for supernova explosions of the sn 1987a - type .",
    "notably , two b[e]sgs were recently suggested to be viable sn1987a - type progenitor candidates : in the small magellanic cloud and the galactic object mwc137 @xcite . for a better understanding of the evolution of these stars up to the supernova stage",
    ", it is hence essential to study b[e]sgs in great detail , and in particular their mass - loss behavior and the chemistry involved in the formation of the observed dense molecular and dusty rings or disk - like structures .",
    "the atmospheres of massive stars have an oxygen - rich composition , which means that the abundance of oxygen atoms greatly exceeds that of carbon atoms .",
    "the same trend is then expected in their disks , because they form from the material released from the stellar surface .",
    "consequently , carbon atoms in the disks are locked in co , which , as the most stable molecule with a dissociation energy of 11.2ev , forms as soon as the gas temperature drops below the dissociation temperature of co , for which a value of @xmath4k is typically quoted .",
    "the excess oxygen atoms will form other molecules , and a rich chemistry is expected at larger distances from the star .",
    "the sio molecule is the second most stable oxygen compound .",
    "its binding energy of 8.0ev is higher than that of other oxides or oxygen compounds such as no , oh , or water , but lower than that of co , and thus sio should form in slightly cooler environments ( @xmath5k ) . as with co , the rather high gas temperature of the sio forming region guarantees that high vibrational levels will be excited , causing coupled rotational - vibrational transitions , detectable via prominent band and band head features . and",
    "in fact , sio bands are commonly observed in absorption in the atmospheres of mira stars , cool giants , and red supergiants . in these objects",
    ", sio is an important molecule , based on which the physical properties in the transition region between the outer atmosphere and the innermost circumstellar envelope can be studied .    to our knowledge , rotational - vibrational sio bands in emission have only been reported for supernova 1987a @xcite .",
    "these emission bands appeared 160 days after the outburst and were not detectable beyond day 578 .",
    "the rise of the sio features had a time - delay of 48 days with respect to that of co molecular bands .",
    "this is in agreement with the lower binding energy , requiring a cooler environment for the formation of sio molecules by gas phase chemistry .",
    "the disappearance of the emission bands agrees with the onset of dust formation in the ejecta , which is interpreted as depletion of molecular sio due to condensation of silicate dust , for which the sio molecule is proposed to be a major building block within an oxygen - rich environment .    unlike the transient phenomena of a rapidly expanding , diluting ejecta of a supernova , the rings or disks around b[e]sgs seem to be quite stable structures of accumulated material .",
    "this guarantees these disks as ideal chemical laboratories to study molecule formation and dust condensation . however , apart from co band emission , detected in most of these objects , and warm circumstellar dust , no information exists about the chemical composition of these disks .",
    "hence , it is necessary to begin searching for other molecular emission features that can be used to study the structure and kinematics of b[e]sg stars disks comprehensively .    to pioneer this work",
    ", we selected a sample of galactic b[e]sgs , with known co band emission , to search for molecular rotational - vibrational band emission from sio .",
    "during the period of march - may 2014 , we observed four galactic b[e]sgs in the @xmath0-band wavelength region using the cryogenic high - resolution infrared echelle spectrograph ( crires , * ? ? ? * ) on the eso vlt ut1-antu 8-m telescope .",
    "details on the objects and their observations are given in table[tbl_obs ] .",
    "data were obtained at four different standard settings with reference wavelengths of 4048.6 , 4060.1 , 4135.5 , and 4147.0 nm , so that the total spectra cover a continuous wavelength range from 3.9884.176@xmath6 m .",
    "this range contains the first four band heads of the sio first - overtone bands .",
    "we used the 0.4slit , which provides a spectral resolution of @xmath7 , corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath8kms@xmath9 .",
    "data reduction was performed with the eso crires pipeline ( version 2.3.2 ) .",
    "the observations were taken in an abba nod pattern for proper sky subtractions .",
    "raw frames were corrected for bad pixels , flat fields , non - linearity , and then wavelength calibrated using oh lines in the standard star spectrum .",
    "a telluric standard star observation was similarly reduced . for telluric correction , a b - type standard",
    "star was observed immediately after the target at a similar airmass .",
    "the iraf task _ telluric _ was used to remove the atmospheric features .",
    "the final spectra were normalized and continuum subtracted .",
    "we clearly detect emission from the first three band heads of the sio first - overtone bands in cpd-529243 ( fig.[fig_cpd - fit ] ) , and from the first band head in the spectra of the other three stars , cpd-57 2874 , hd327083 , and hd62623 ( fig.[fig_sio ] ) .    in each star",
    "s spectrum , the band heads display a blue - shifted shoulder and a red - shifted maximum with respect to the laboratory wavelength .",
    "their separation is marked by the bar in figs.[fig_cpd - fit ] and [ fig_sio ] .",
    "such structures are also typically observed in the band heads of co , and are an unequivocal manifestation of rotational broadening .    to confirm that the observed features are emission from sio molecules , we compute synthetic band head models . for this",
    ", we modify our existing co disk code by implementing the sio line lists and einstein transition probabilities provided by @xcite . for each of our targets , information about the rotation velocity of the co region and disk inclination angles are listed in table[tbl_param ] .",
    "the rotation velocities of the co gas have been obtained from the broadening of the first band head of the co first - overtone bands resolved in high - resolution spectra , and the disk inclination angles have been determined from interferometric observations . from the wavelength separation between the position of the blue shoulder and the red peak of the first band head , we obtain an estimate of the sio rotation velocity projected to the line of sight .",
    "this parameter is refined during the fitting procedure .",
    "the final rotation velocities , corrected for disk inclination , are included in table[tbl_param ] .",
    "the high spectral resolution , combined with the sensitivity of the synthetic spectra to rotation velocity , guarantee that these values have a precision of @xmath10kms@xmath9 . comparing the velocities obtained in the two molecular band emitting regions , we find a consistently lower value for sio , suggesting that this molecule is formed within the keplerian disk at larger distances from the star .    for cpd-52 9243 , where three observed band heads are available , we can also constrain temperature and column density , for which we find @xmath11k and @xmath12@xmath13 . with this column density ,",
    "most of the individual sio rotation - vibration lines within the observed wavelength range are optically thick .",
    "although the sio rotation velocity in this object is only marginally lower , both temperature and column density are significantly lower than the values obtained from the co modeling .",
    "this suggests that the two band head formation regions are physically disjoint .    for the other three objects , where solely the first band head is detected",
    ", it is only possible to constrain the rotation velocity , because different combinations of temperature and density result in almost identical synthetic spectra .",
    "hence , the fits shown in fig.[fig_sio ] are only to demonstrate that the observed features can indeed be assigned to sio band emission , and to determine the sio rotation velocity .    under the assumption of keplerian rotation of the disks and using the stellar mass ranges of the objects ( table[tbl_obs ] ) ,",
    "the radii of both ( co and sio ) molecular rings can be computed .",
    "these values are included in table[tbl_param ] .",
    "furthermore , considering that the circumstellar dust is mainly composed of silicates , we can calculate the dust evaporation distances .",
    "assuming that the grains are spheres with a maximum size of @xmath14 m , and that the silicate evaporation temperature is @xmath15k , the minimum dust evaporation radii follow from the stellar luminosities ( listed in table[tbl_obs ] ) and are added to table[tbl_param ] .",
    "obviously , the much hotter molecular rings reside within the dusty disks .",
    "we report on the detection of sio first - overtone band emission in the high - resolution @xmath0-band spectra of four galactic b[e]sgs , which are known to display strong co band emission .",
    "while sio bands are commonly seen in absorption from the atmospheres of cool stars and giants , they were detected in emission , so far , only in spectra of sn1987a during the post - explosion period from day 160 to day 578 .",
    "hence , to our knowledge , this is the first discovery of sio first - overtone band emission from hot , high - density environments of evolved massive stars .",
    "the high spectral resolution of our data allows us to precisely determine the rotation velocity of the sio gas .",
    "for all of our target stars , this velocity is lower than that determined from the co band forming region .",
    "moreover , model fits to the observed three band heads in cpd-52 9243 demonstrate that , in contrast to the co band emitting region , the emission of the sio bands originates from a cooler and less dense disk region , indicating that sio molecules form at larger distances within the keplerian disks .",
    "for all four objects , we find , in addition , that the sio ring radii are smaller than the silicate dust evaporation distances .",
    "this finding is of great importance , because it demonstrates that molecules provide an excellent tool to study b[e]sg stars disks .",
    "the emission features of both molecules detected so far , co and sio , carry all the essential information about the physical properties ( temperature , density ) and kinematics of their formation region . as different molecules require diverse conditions , a huge variety can be expected to form throughout the disk , filling the space between the hottest inner rim traced by co bands , and the dust condensation region .",
    "hence , it is essential and timely to search for emission features from many more molecules that are expected to form within the oxygen - rich environment of these disks .",
    "moreover , molecules such as co and sio are also indispensable to study the disk structure at much larger distances . with their numerous pure rotational transitions ,",
    "these molecules are also suitable to trace much cooler environments .",
    "the rotational transitions spread over the submm and radio regime , making the disks of b[e]sgs ideal targets to be observed with high spatial and spectral resolution facilities such as alma . combining the results obtained from different molecular species tracing diverse temperature regions , and hence distances from the star , will greatly improve our knowledge and comprehension of the disk structure , and help to understand the disks possible formation history .",
    "in addition , the discovery of sio band emission has an even wider impact",
    ". evolved massive stars , such as red supergiants , b[e]sgs , and supernovae ( e.g. , sn1987a ) , are the main sources of silicate dust , for which sio molecules are regarded as a major building block . studying the physical properties of sio gas in the disks of b[e]sgs might , hence , provide indispensable insight into the early stage of silicate dust formation within the oxygen - rich environment of these enigmatic stars .",
