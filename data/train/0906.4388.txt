    "this excitation of the @xmath44 field will be temporally brief , and if the inhomogeneous broadening is flat the ensemble of atoms will quickly dephase leading to no net polarization in the ensemble shortly after the @xmath9 pulse .",

    "[ fig : dlcz_new]b .",
    "it is worth noting that the modified dlcz protocol does not have the same issue with echo efficiency as the two level scheme because the classical coupling field can be altered meaning that the ensemble can be optically thin for the writing process and thicker for the reading process .",
