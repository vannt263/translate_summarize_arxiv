    "quantum information offers advantages in variety tasks over classical counterparts , by virtue of fundamental properties of quantum physics @xcite .",
    "quantum theory imposes , on the other hand , certain restrictions on quantum tasks @xcite .",
    "for example , an arbitrary quantum state can not be cloned , called no - cloning theorem , so that the superluminal ( i.e. faster than light ) communication via entanglement is prohibited @xcite .",
    "another quantum task of universal - not ( u - not ) that transforms an arbitrary input state to its orthogonal is also restricted by quantum theory , while its classical task not is perfectly realized by bit - flip operation @xcite .",
    "this is because u - not can not be implemented by a unitary operation but by an anti - unitary operation , violating the conditions of trace preservation and complete positivity that a physical procedure obeys @xcite .",
    "an approximate realization of u - not task can nevertheless be done by a physical operation assisted by ancillary qubits @xcite .",
    "the approximate operation is the most optimal when it yields the average fidelity @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such an optimal operation has extensively been studied for the last decade both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in order to clarify capabilities and limitations of quantum information processing . in another perspective , the optimal operation of u - not is closely related to other important quantum tasks such as quantum cloning , quantum state estimation , and entanglement test @xcite . in particular , u - not is equivalent to the transposition by some unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "this implies that the optimal operation of u - not enables to approximately test if a quantum state is entangled with negative partial transposition @xcite .",
    "a physical operation has been evaluated in terms of the fidelity between its output state and the target of the task . in particular , the average fidelity over all possible input states has been employed as an optimality measure of the operation to the task . however the average fidelity itself tells nothing about universality of operation , the condition that the task is performed equally for all possible input states . in a theoretical side ,",
    "universality can be imposed on a quantum operation by requiring it to result in an equal fidelity for all input states . on the other hand ,",
    "such requirement is nontrivial in experiments where imperfections of control and noises by environment arise .",
    "it is thus desired to consider a measure to quantify the condition for the operation to be universal over all input states .",
    "as such a measure , we employ fidelity deviation which is defined by the standard deviation of fidelity over all possible input states .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider procedures to realize an approximate universal not gate .",
    "for the purpose , we characterize its approximate operations in terms of average fidelity @xmath1 and fidelity deviation @xmath2 . in the characterization",
    ", it is shown that one - qubit operations have a sharp trade - off relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; two - qubit operations exhibit a less sharp trade - off relation , including the one - qubit relation as an upper bound .",
    "the genuine universality of @xmath3 holds for @xmath4-qubit operations with @xmath5 ancillary qubits if @xmath6 , whereas , no matter how many qubits are involved in , the optimality is bounded in the average fidelity of @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the operations of more than @xmath7 qubits can be beneficial to get more universality against imperfection of control .",
    "we can easily find a quantum operation of u - not which has rather high fidelity deviation even though its average fidelity is very close to its maximum .",
    "therefore , investigating the universality and the optimality is important in the realization of u - not .",
    "in addition , considering some realistic circumstances , we take into account operational noises which contaminate quantum operation once optimized .",
    "we find a case that such a polluted operation is far from the universality no matter how close its average fidelity is to the maximum of @xmath0 . to protect an operation against operational noises",
    ", we suggest a feedback scheme of using a differential evolution , showing that our scheme recovers the operation from the contamination as far as the noises fluctuate slowly compared to the operation .",
    "it is discussed that our scheme of feedback is applicable to find an optimal operation of u - not with no _ a priori _ knowledge except the number of qubits .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we introduce our approach for the optimality and the universality by employing average fidelity @xmath1 and fidelity deviation @xmath2 .",
    "sec.iii is devoted to analyses of quantum operations for task u - not on the two - dimensional space of ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) . in sec.iv , we investigate effects of operational noises on optimal operation of u - not and we suggest a feedback scheme to cure the contaminated operation by noise .",
    "remarks are given in sec.v .",
    "a task is realized by a physical operation @xmath8 that transforms an input state @xmath9 to its target state @xmath10 .",
    "some tasks can not be ideally realized as restricted by quantum laws , such as quantum cloning @xcite .",
    "it is thus desirable to find an approximate but optimal operation as close as possible to a given task .",
    "the quality of a found operation @xmath8 is commonly quantified by a quantum fidelity @xmath11 , that is defined by the transition probability between the output state @xmath12 and the target state @xmath10 of an input state @xmath9 : @xmath13 = |{\\left<\\psi_t\\right|}\\hat{o}{\\left|\\psi\\right>}|^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a given operation , the fidelity varies in general on input states . if not , the quantum operation is said to be universal .",
    "the universality can thus be thought of as associated with the fluctuation of the fidelity @xmath11 over the input states . in that sense , by the universal operation , the task can be performed equally for all possible input states .",
    "however , in some realistic circumstances , it is difficult to achieve the universality even for the universal operation , due to noise(s ) during the physical process and/or an unavoidable interaction with environment .",
    "it is thus necessary to introduce a measure to quantify how much the fidelity @xmath11 fluctuate depending on the input states and to examine whether to reduce it by altering experimental parameters . in this section ,",
    "we propose to employ the average fidelity for quantifying the optimality of an operation and the fidelity deviation for quantifying the universality .",
