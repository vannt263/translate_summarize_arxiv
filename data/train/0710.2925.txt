    "since the beginning of 1990 s , chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt ) has been extensively applied to few - nucleon system .",
    "an advantageous point inherent in @xmath0pt is that it bridges over different reactions in a model - independent manner .",
    "once couplings ( the so - called low - energy constant , lec ) included in a chiral operator are fixed using data for one of the reactions , then the other reactions are predicted using the same operator .",
    "an interesting interaction in this context is , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "the spin operator is @xmath8 , and the external vector ( axial ) current is @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath11 is a lec .",
    "this contact interaction contributes to the three - nucleon force , and several processes such as the @xmath1-wave @xmath2-production ( @xmath5@xcite ) , and weak processes ( tritium @xmath12-decay , @xmath3@xcite ) .",
    "we can fix @xmath11 using one of the above reactions , and predict the others .",
    "such a `` bridging program '' has been done in several works .",
    "one of them was done by park _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where they fixed @xmath11 using the experimental tritium @xmath12-decay rate , and performed a parameter - free calculation of the weak proton capture by a proton ( or @xmath13he ) .",
    "another work was due to hanhart _ et al . _",
    "the authors calculated the partial wave amplitude ( @xmath4 ) for the @xmath1-wave @xmath2-production ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "even though this work was not a fully consistent bridging program , they showed that the use of @xmath11 fixed by three - nucleon observables consistently reproduces @xmath4 extracted from data  @xcite .    in this work ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a full account ) , we investigate more seriously how reliably the bridging program , an important aspect of @xmath0pt , works . we believe that our investigation is important because we have sometimes seen an argument which supposes , without a serious test , that the bridging program works . for this purpose ,",
    "we calculate the partial wave amplitude ( @xmath4 ) for the @xmath1-wave @xmath2-production ( @xmath5 ) , with @xmath11 fixed by a low - energy weak process .",
    "this obviously provides a stringent test of @xmath0pt , because the two reactions are strong and weak processes , and are quite different in kinematics .",
    "we use the following @xmath2-production operators by referring to ref .",
    "@xcite in which the operators were derived using a counting rule based on an expansion parameter , @xmath14 ; the nucleon ( pion ) mass is denoted by @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the leading order ( lo , @xmath17 ) operator is the one - body direct production of the pion off the nucleon . another lo mechanism we consider is the @xmath18-excitation followed by the @xmath2 emission . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors used the wave function which explicitly includes the @xmath18 component , and considered the one - body operator which produces the pion with the @xmath18 deexcited to the nucleon .",
    "because we use nuclear wave functions with only the nucleonic degrees of freedom , we alternatively use a two - body operator in which the @xmath18 is excited either by the @xmath2-exchange or by a contact interaction .",
    "next we discuss next - to - leading order ( nlo , @xmath19 ) terms : the recoil correction to the lo terms ; a pion rescattering through the vertices whose strength are @xmath20 and @xmath21 , or through the weinberg - tomozawa term or its galilean correction ; a pion emission from the contact term whose coupling constant is @xmath11 .",
    "the unknown coupling , @xmath11 , will be determined in the next paragraph .",
    "we start with a benchmark calculation .",
    "we employ the same axial current operator used in ref .",
    "the @xmath11 value in this operator has been fixed using the tritium @xmath12-decay rate .",
    "we calculate the gamow - teller matrix element for the low - energy @xmath3 reaction and regard it as the benchmark .",
    "our axial current is different from ref .",
    "@xcite in that we consider the @xmath18 explicitly .",
    "we calculate the matrix element using our operator and fit @xmath11 to the benchmark result .",
    "we use several combinations of the @xmath22 coupling ( @xmath23 ) , the @xmath24 potential and the cutoff ( @xmath25 ) , and obtain the corresponding @xmath11 values with a natural strength .",
    "with the chiral operator fixed in the previous section , we calculate @xmath4 for @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present @xmath4 as a function of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the maximum pion momentum .",
    "we used the cd - bonn @xmath24 potential and two ( three ) choices of @xmath23 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "the chiral nlo @xmath2 production operator plus the @xmath28-term is used .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted curves correspond to @xmath29 500 , 600 and 800  mev , respectively , and @xmath30 2.10 .",
    "the other features are the same as fig .",
    "[ fig1].,width=245 ]     the amplitude @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "the chiral nlo @xmath2 production operator plus the @xmath28-term is used .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted curves correspond to @xmath29 500 , 600 and 800  mev , respectively , and @xmath30 2.10 .",
    "the other features are the same as fig .",
    "[ fig1].,width=245 ]    our result is rather different from the data . for comparison ,",
    "we show @xmath4 obtained without the @xmath11 term .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath11 term makes the disagreement worse ; even the sign of @xmath11 fixed by the low - energy weak process is inconsistent with the data .",
    "we change the values of @xmath25 , @xmath23 and the @xmath24 potential , however , the situation of the disagreement does not change .",
    "this result shows that the bridging program among reactions with significantly different kinematics is not necessarily successful .",
    "the failure of the bridging program is understandable if we recall the success of the chiral nuclear force which describes the @xmath24 scattering in a wide energy region .",
    "this is partly because the lecs have been fitted to data from the same energy region . in order to accurately describe the two reactions in different energy regions , data from the both energy region are necessary to fix the lecs .",
    "it is also expected that higher order terms are necessary to accurately reproduce the data from the wide energy region .    to explore , even roughly , a higher order calculation",
    ", we perform a simple extension of the previous calculation by adding @xmath31 to the nlo operator .",
    "now we have the two independent lecs : @xmath11 and @xmath28 .",
    "we fix these two lecs to reproduce two quantities : the benchmark result for the matrix element of @xmath3 ; @xmath4 for @xmath5 at @xmath32 from data .",
    "we obtain a set of @xmath11 and @xmath28 with a natural strength in this way .",
    "we calculate @xmath4 with the extended operator and show the result in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . by construction",
    ", the calculated @xmath4 goes through the central value of the data at @xmath33 0.5 .",
    "we examined the dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath23 , @xmath25 and the @xmath24 potential , and found that the @xmath34 dependence of @xmath4 is consistent with the data .",
    "we determined @xmath11 , the lec of the contact term , using the weak process and then used it to predict @xmath4 for @xmath5 . through this work",
    ", we tried to explore the power of @xmath0pt that enables us to bridge different reactions .",
    "our prediction of @xmath4 with the nlo operator does not agree with the data .",
    "the result indicates that the bridging program between reactions with significantly different kinematics is not always successful .",
    "the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada is thanked for financial support .",
    "triumf receives federal funding via a contribution agreement through the national research council of canada ."
