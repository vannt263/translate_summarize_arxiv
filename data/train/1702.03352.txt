    "@xmath0ni is the most abundant stable isotope of nickel ( table  [ tab : ni ] ) and of special interest for astrophysics and reactor technologies .",
    "neutron capture on @xmath0ni produces the long - lived isotope @xmath9ni which has an adopted half - life of @xmath10= 76(5 )  ka @xcite .",
    "however , recent measurements have shown that this value could be as high as 97(9 )  ka @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0ni is an important constituent of structure materials in nuclear reactors , neutron activation leads to a potential radiation hazard . in astrophysics",
    "it is an important seed nucleus for the `` slow neutron capture '' ( @xmath11 ) process , and the half - life of @xmath9ni is long enough that under typical conditions no significant branching occurs and the main reaction flow continues via @xmath0ni@xmath1ni@xmath12ni .",
