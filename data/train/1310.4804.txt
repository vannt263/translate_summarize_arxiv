    "quantifying the star formation histories of galaxies constitutes one of the major unsolved issues towards a complete understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "although this task is difficult , analyses of stellar populations constitute a step forward toward the achievement of this goal . in the majority of cases",
    ", these studies have to be made using integrated spectra or colours , as we can only resolve stars in a limited number of galaxies . while studies of stellar populations for early - type galaxies are abundant in the literature ( e.g. , trager et al .",
    "2000 ; kuntschner 2000 , thomas et al . 2005 ; snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "2006abc ; smith , lucy & hudson 2007 , among may others ) , these studies are much more sparse for disc galaxies . until very recently , the study of the stellar component in disk galaxies outside the local group was restricted to broadband photometric data ( bell & de jong 2000 ; macarthur et al .",
    "2004 ; pohlen & trujillo 2006 ; muoz - mateos et al . 2007 ; roediger et al . 2012 ) .",
    "these studies find that disc galaxies tend to be bluer in the external parts , a trend that is usually interpreted in terms of stellar population gradients as galaxies tend to be younger and more metal poor in the external parts .",
    "however , there are large discrepancies in the magnitude of the stellar population gradients derived by different authors due , partially , to the difficulty in disentangling the effects of the age , metallicity and dust extinction by using only colours .",
    "spectroscopic studies may help to alleviate the associated degeneracies but the low surface brightness of the disc region and the nebular emission lines filling some of the most important age - diagnostic absorption features make these studies very difficult . in the last few years , however , the advent of new techniques to separate the contributions of stellar and gaseous components ( see , e.g . , sarzi et al .",
    "2005 ) and large aperture telescopes have allowed the obtention of enlightening results in this field ( see , e.g. , yoachim & dalcanton 2008 ; macarthur , gonzlez & courteau 2009 ; prez et al .",
    "2011 ; snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "all the studies quoted above used long - slit spectroscopy , focusing along a predefined spatial axis .",
    "disc galaxies , however , have a complex geometry , with many structural components , such as bulges , bars , rings , etc , which makes the interpretation of the long - slit data a difficult task .",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs , hereafter ) allows the study of the different galaxy components mentioned above separately .",
    "ifs data cubes provide , for each pixel of the galaxy , a spectrum from which absorption and emission lines can be extracted , allowing to decipher the star formation history and the physical properties of the interstellar medium in galaxies .",
    "also , ifs offers a unique opportunity to improve the signal to noise ratio of the data by averaging many more spectra in the external parts of the galaxy and makes easier the masking or the extraction of the hii regions in the spatial map . in the last few years",
    ", there have been some studies of the stellar population properties of disc galaxies from ifs spectroscopy ( ganda et al .  2007 ; snchez et al .",
    "2011 ; yoachim et al .",
    "2009 , 2012 ) , probing the potential of this technique .",
    "in fact , many ongoing and planned surveys are devoted to the observations of nearby galaxies using integral field units ( e.g. , califa ( snchez et al . 2011 ) ; venga ( blanc et al . 2010 ) ; sami ( croom et al . 2012 ) ; manga ( k. bundy ) ) .",
    "a further complication in the study of stellar population in disc galaxies is that , surely , the stars did not form in a single burst of a given age and metallicity as usually assumed in studies of early - type galaxies .",
    "therefore , the comparison of spectral characteristics with single stellar populations ( ssp ) models leads to information which is difficult to interpret .",
    "fortunately , in the last decade there has been a tremendous improvement in the stellar population analysis techniques , associated with the release of well - calibrated stellar libraries ( e.g. , stelib , leborgne et al .",
    "2003 ; miles , snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "2006 ; indo - us ( valdes et al .  2004 ) ; cat ( cenarro et al .",
    "2001ab ) that have allowed the construction of stellar population models that predict the whole synthetic spectrum of a population with a given age and metallicity ( e.g. , vazdekis 1999 ; vazdekis et al . 2003 , 2010 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 , conroy et al .",
    "2009 , 2010ab ; maraston & strmbck 2011 ) .",
    "this has driven the development of inversion algorithms to extract information about the star formation histories and the metallicity evolution from integrated spectra ( e.g. , moped : heavens et al .",
    "2000 , panter et al . 2003 ; starlight : cid fernandes et al .",

    "we derive the stellar population properties and star formation histories of ngc  628 in a 3-dimensional fashion , using several techniques .",
    "ngc  628 ( m74 ) is an extensively studied isolated grand - design sa(s)c ( corwin et al .",

    "regarding its structure , ngc  628 shows an outer hi ring at around 12 arcmin from the nucleus ( roberts 1962 ; briggs et al .",
    "1980 ) that seems to be due to the interaction with two large high - velocity clouds accreting onto the outer parts of the disc ( kamphuis & briggs 1992 ; lpez - corredoira et al . 2002",

    "the main properties of the galaxy are shown in table  [ tab : n628 ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one of the most important problems affecting stellar population studies is the well known age - metallicity degeneracy , i.e .. , the colours and spectral characteristics of a given population can be mimicked with another population younger but more metal rich or older but more metal poor . to explore upon what extent",
    "we are affected by this degeneracy , we use the integrated spectrum of ngc  628 and added noise to simulate spectra of signal - to - noise 20 , 40 and 70 ( 70 is the s / n of the original spectrum ) .",
    "we performed 2500 montecarlo simulations in which each pixel was perturbed with the associated noise error , following a gaussian distribution . for each simulation",
    "a new value of the age and metallicity was derived .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ chi_map ] .",
    "the mean values obtained and the root - mean square dispersion ( rms ) are shown in table  [ table : simus ] . as can be seen , as the noise increase , also the uncertainty in the parameters and , therefore , the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "furthermore , there seem to be a small systematic effect in the sense that as the noise increase , the mean derived age decrease .",
    "we decided to bin our data with a minimum signal - to - noise of 40 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec_maps ] ) as a compromise between obtaining good quality spectra and resolve spatially the different components of the galaxy .",
    "the typical dispersion in the mean luminosity - weighted age and metallicity derived in a spectrum with this signal - to - noise is 0.05 , and slightly larger for the mass - weighted means ( 0.08 and 0.06 for the age and metallicity values respectively ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_sfr ] shows the typical steckmap outputs for the integrated spectra of ngc  628 .",
    "the flux and mass fraction and the derived age metallicity relation shows that the majority of the stars in this galaxy formed @xmath1013 gyr ago and less than 10% of stars did it @xmath0 1 gyr ago .",
    "note , that the maximum age of the models used here is 17.78  gyr , ie .",
    ", exceeding the age of the universe in the adopted cosmology .",
    "it goes beyond the scope of this paper discussing the reasons for these discrepancies and we just caution the reader that the absolute values of the old populations have to be taken as approximate values . in any case",
    ", this does not affect any of our conclusions as we will only discuss relative stellar population variations along the galactic radius and relative trends between very old and young populations .",
    "in order to reach the desired signal - to - noise ratio for our analysis  to ensure an appropriate modeling of the stellar populations  we used the voronoi tessellation algorithm of cappellari & copin ( 2003 ) and the pingsoft ( rosales - ortega 2011 ) software to bin the data cube in regions with a minimum signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of 40 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : steckmap ] ) , over a spectral region centered at 5400     with a 100    width . figure  [ voronoi_binning ] shows the different regions binned in our scheme of the voronoi - tessellation algorithm .",
    "we run steckmap on each of the binned spectra and obtained star formation histories and age - metallicity relations for all of them .",
    "once we have derived star formation histories , we can obtain average values weighted by the flux or by the mass of the population . while the mean values weighted with mass are going to be biased towards the parameters of the majority of the stars , the flux - weighed values are biased to the parameters of the youngest component , as young stars are much more luminous in the wavelength range we are studying .",
    "figure  [ fig_maps ] shows the luminosity- and mass - weighted maps of age and metallicity for ngc  628 .",
    "several things can be appreciated in these maps .",
    "the mass - weighted mean age map shows that the majority of the stars in the galaxy are old , even in the most external regions sampled by the data , while the luminosity weighted age map reveals younger population in the external parts . in the mass - weighted age map a ring of younger ( with an average age of @xmath01.7 gyr ) population",
    "is also clearly visible with yellowish colors , coincident with a young ring that has also been detected in co ( wakker & adler 1995 ) .",
    "the mass - weighted metallicity map shows that the ring and the central parts of the galaxy are more metal poor than the external parts , which is compatible with the idea that the central ring has been formed as a consequence of the inflows of gas from the external parts ( e.g. , kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; snchez et al .",
    "2011 ) . in the next section ,",
    "we quantify these trends .      to obtain radial trends of the stellar population parameters , we average the individual spectra in concentric annuli , which allows to obtain the required signal - to - noise ratio for our analysis up to @xmath0 120 arcsec ( @xmath00.4@xmath11 or @xmath05.4 kpc ) in linear projected galactocentric radii .",
    "we obtained azimuthally averaged spectra by co - adding all the spectra within successive rings of 4 arcsec .",
    "these azimuthally averaged spectra were then analysed using the fitting procedure described above .",
    "following zou et al .",

    "figure  [ fig_sfr1 ] shows the mean flux fraction as a function of age and the age - metallicity relation calculated at different distances from the center of the galaxy .",
    "it can be seen that , in the center , there is a younger population ( @xmath02 gyr ) that dominates the flux while its contribution gets diluted as we go to larger radii .",
    "we also see an increase in the metallicity with time , as it will be expected in a normal chemical evolution model .",

    "we will analyse the gradients inside and outside this region separately .",
    "the mass - weighted age of this galaxy is old ( @xmath010 gyr ) at all sampled radii , i.e. , the disc is dominated in mass by old stars , even at @xmath02 scale - length .",
    "this is in agreement with snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , where it was found that the mean , mass - weighted age of 4 disc galaxies was also around @xmath0  10  gyr , at radii larger than 2  scale - length of the discs ( see also macarthur et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the luminosity - weighted mean age is biased towards the age of the youngest components , as these components are much more luminous in the wavelength range we are studying . here , it can be seen , as we have already mentioned , that the age gradient show two different behavior . in the inner disc the gradient is flatter ( or even positive , with age increasing with radius ) .",
    "a minimum in the mean luminosity - weighted age can also be seen in at @xmath010@xmath7 ( this is more readily seen in the azimuthally weighted values , where the errors are smaller ) , coincident with the radius of a circumnuclear star forming ring previously detected in sub - mm co ( 1 - 0 ) observations ( wakker & adler 1995 ) and infrared 2.3 @xmath3 m co absorption ( james & seigar 1999 ) and was also seen by ganda et al .",

    "we also find a change of slope at a similar radius but the trends that we derive are very different in both studies .",
    "zou et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that the inner region of the disc ( from 30 - 60@xmath7 ) have a much steeper gradient than the outer region , which is completely the opposite to what we find in the present study .",
    "our profile , however , coincides very well with that of snchez et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sanchez ] ) .",
    "the metallicity gradient also shows two differentiated regions , being almost flat or slightly positive in the central parts and negative outwards .",
    "the radius at which the metallicity gradient changes slope is similar to the break calculated by scarano & lpine ( 2013 ) for the gas - phase metallicity using data from rosales - ortega et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and also similar to the break in the stellar metallicity found by zou et al .",
    "in fact , qualitatively , the trends found by zou et al .",
    "( 2011 ) are very similar to our ; in the disc region the metallicity increase with radius until @xmath14 and decrease slightly beyond .",
    "our gradient in the internal regions is , however , much milder and the overall metallicities considerably larger those that derived by the quoted authors and the radius at which the gradient change slope is larger .",
    "this dual behavior is , however , not reported by snchez et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , although their luminosity - weighted values of age and metallicity are in a very good agreement with ours ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sanchez ] ) .    to check the reliability of this break we compare the metallicities obtained with our methods with those obtained with a better understood and widely used method , a classical index - index diagram .",
    "figure  [ compara ] shows the comparison of the metallicity gradient obtained with steckmap and the one obtained using an index - index diagram combining h@xmath13 and [ mgbfe ] .",
    "we are not comparing exactly the same quantity as the metallicity obtained by using an index - index diagram is a single - stellar population equivalent value , while the one obtained with steckmap is a luminosity - weighted one .",
    "however , it has been shown that these two measurements give very similar values ( serra & trager 2007 ) .",
    "it can be seen that , although the ssp - equivalent values are noisier , the trends obtained with the two methods are very similar and , in particular , a change of slope is visible at the same radius .    the different trends in age and metallicity between this study and that of zou et al .  ( 2011 ) shows the difficultly in deriving accurate stellar population parameters using broad band colors , due to the existent degeneracies between age , metallicity and dust extinction .",
    "it is worth noticing that the broad band optical color profiles of this galaxy show , in fact , a very steep slope in the inner region of the disc while it flattens out beyond 1@xmath6 .",
    "on the contrary , we obtain much flatter colors of age and metallicity in the inner regions of the disc .",
    "we prove , however , in sec .",
    "[ comp : photometry ] that we can reproduce the observed colors of this galaxy using our derived star formation histories .",
    "one of the advantages of being able to derive an age - metallicity relation is that it allows us , in principle , to obtain the time evolution of the metallicity gradient .",
    "the temporal evolution of the metallicity gradient is an issue that is not yet settled from neither , the theoretical or the observational point of view .",
    "some chemical evolution models predict a steepening with time starting from initially inverted or flat gradients ( e.g. chiappini , matteucci & romano 2001 ) while others predict an initially negative gradient that flattens ( e.g. , moll & daz 2005 ) .",
    "recent work ( pilkington et al .  2012 ; gibson et al .",
    "2013 ) have showed that , in cosmological simulations , the evolution of the metallicity gradient with time depends on the details of the sub - grid physics implemented in the hydrodynamical codes of galaxy formation , in particular , on the feedback scheme . therefore , the study of the metallicity gradient for different age population in galaxies are key to reveal the formation processes of disc galaxies and better constrain the physics included in numerical simulations .",
    "some authors have studied this evolution in our own mw using planetary nebulae ( e.g. , maciel et al .",
    "2003 ; stanghellini & haywood 2010 ; maciel & costa 2013 ) also with discrepant results .",
    "a direct measurement of the evolution of the metallicity gradients can be obtained analysing the magnitude of the gas - phase metallicity gradient at high redshift ( cresci et al .",

    "however , the difficulties in obtaining high resolution data for likely mw progenitors has mean that the theoreticians have had very few constraints on their models , as different paths can lead to a similar final metallicity gradient .",

    "it can be seen that , if we restrict ourselves to the younger stars ( those with ages@xmath52 gyr ) , the gradient shows a linear behavior , decreasing slightly with radius , and it is very similar to the gradient of the ionized gas . on the contrary , the metallicity profile for the older stars",

    "on the other hand , numerical simulations have shown that radial migrations due to the presence of non - axisymmetric components , like bars or spiral arms , can make that an important percentage of stars currently in the outer parts of the disc may have formed closer to the center of the disc and migrated outward to their current locations .",
    "therefore , an observed old stellar population in the outer disc may not necessarily indicate that the outer disc formed early . in the present study , we have been able to analyse , for the first time , the evolution of the stellar metallicity gradient with time from integrated spectra . in the @xmath7outer@xmath7-disc region",
    ", we have found that the metallicity gradient for the old stellar population is steeper than that of the young component .",
    "this , in principle , can be a sign that stellar migration has not been very important in the disc region of this galaxy . however , to conclude this we would need to know the original _ gas - phase _ metallicity gradient at the epoch of formation of these old stars , which could have been even steeper .      at radius @xmath19 both , the mean age and metallicity profiles , are flatter than in the external disc .",
    "in fact , the gradient is even positive for the luminosity - weighted values of age and metallicities .",
    "this is difficult to explain in an inside - out formation scenario for the disc formation and requires an explanation .",
    "the change in the slope of the gas - phase metallicity gradient has been observed before in many galaxies ( e.g. , zaritsky 1992 ; vila - costas & edmunds 1992 ; martin & roy 1995 ; dutil & roy 1999 ; roy & walsh 1997 ; zahid & bresolin 2011 ; scarano & lpine 2013 ) and it is usually interpreted as the result of variations of gas density , the large - scale mixing induced by a bar ( friedli & benz 1995 ) , or by the spiral arms . in this case , the change of slope coincide with the corotation radius of the spiral patterns ( e.g. , scarano , lpine & marcon - uchida 2011 ; scarano & lpine 2013 ) .",
    "this is because the main gas flows have opposite directions inside and outside corotations .",
    "however , the above mechanism applies to young objects , such hii regions , that reveal the present value of the metallicity in the interstellar medium the fact that the break in the stellar metallicitiy is more pronounced in the older component points toward dynamical effects ( radial migrations ) as the cause for the observed dual behavior .",
    "flat gradients , as the ones found here in the inner disc require strong radial mixing , which is difficult to produce with star formation histories but can be achieved in ongoing strong galaxy interactions ( rupke et al .",
    "2010 ) or can be produced by secular evolution in the presence of non - axisymmetric components , like bars , oval or spiral arms .",
    "ngc  628 is classified as an unbarred galaxy and , therefore , if secular evolution has happened , one is tempted to attribute it to the presence of spiral arms .",
    "strong resonant interaction with transient or long - lived spiral arms at the corotation radius can produce stellar wanderings of several kpc in a few hundred myr ( e.g. , sellwood & binney 2002 ; lpine , acharova & mishurov 2003 ; rokar et al .",
    "if the spirals are long - lived , this mechanism has been shown to produce bimodal patterns in the metallicity gradients with breaks at the spiral corotation radius .",
    "the corotation radius for ngc  628 is located around @xmath07  kpc ( sakhibov & smirnov 2004 ) which is outside the region sampled by us .",
    "therefore , the break that we observe here is too internal to be produced by the spiral arms .",
    "however , a change on the slope of the color gradients around this radius has been reported in natali et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .    on the other hand , despite ngc  628",
    "is classified as an unbarred galaxy in de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 atlas ) , near - infrared imaging and isophotal analysis has revealed the existence of an oval distortion with radius of r@xmath050@xmath16 ( laine et al . 2002 ; seigar 2002 ) confirmed by the kinematical analysis by fathi et al .",
    "these authors also conclude that this oval ( a m=2 perturbation ) is the most prominent in the observed velocity field .",
    "thought ovals are rather frequent in disk galaxies , their exact nature has not yet been investigated .",
    "kormendy ( 1979 ) hypothesized that they are products of bars decays , which is supported by some observations of galaxies with prominent rings ( e.g. silchenko & afanasiev 2002 ) .",
    "such a scenario is also predicted by the models of friedli & benz ( 1993 , 1995 ) ; combes et al .",
    "1990 ; raha et al .",
    "1991 ; martinez - valpuesta & shlosman 2004 .",
    "the presence of a circumnuclear ring of star formation ( wakker & adler 1995 ; james & seigar 1999 ) and a central @xmath20-drop ( ganda et al . 2006 ) in ngc  628 support this hypothesis , as the large - scale oval perturbation can transport material from the outer zones to regions near the center of the galaxies ( see fathi et al .",
    "2007 for discussion ) .",
    "our results also show that we have found that the stellar population in the region dominated by the oval distortion reveals a positive luminosity - weighted age and metallicity gradients .",
    "this has been observed in bars ( prez , snchez - blzquez & zurita 2009 ) and , in fact , moorthey & holtzman ( 2006 ) , found that the only galaxies with positive metallicity gradients in the central regions were those hosting bars .",
    "positive stellar population gradients have also been reproduced in chemodynamical simulations of barred galaxies ( wozniak et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "weak oval structures are not believed to have a strong influence in the redistribution of stars inside the galaxy . however , this structures could have been stronger in the past . in fact , some authors ( kormendy 1979 ; 1981 , 1982 ; combes 1996 ) suggest that some bars evolve into lens components . therefore , the arguments above suggest that we could be witnessing a bar in the process of being destroyed , support coming from previous kinematical studies and from our stellar population analysis .",
    "understanding bar formation and evolution is crucial to understand galaxy evolution , yet a fundamental question , namely whether bars can be destroyed by internal processes , remains unanswered .",
    "from the theoretical point of view , there is currently a debate in the literature . on one hand ,",
    "bars seem to be robust structures which can not be easily destroyed by central mass concentration as the observed are not massive enough ( shen & sellwood 2004 ; athanassoula , lambert & dehnen 2005 ) . on the other hand",
    "some numerical simulations predict that bars can be destroyed and reformed when disc are very gaseous , and that galaxies can have up to 3 - 4 generations of bars over a hubble time ( bournaud & combes 2002 ) .",
    "recent observations are consistent with the picture in which bars in early - type disc galaxies are long - lived , whereas those in late - type spirals could be dynamically young ( gadotti & de souza 2005 , 2006 ; elmegreen et al . 2007 ; sheth et al . 2008 ) .",
    "however , there is no observational result to date that indicates whether bars can dissolve . in particular",
    ", we can not tell whether an unbarred galaxy has had a bar in the past .",
    "however , ovals ( or lenses ) can give us some clues , as one of the proposed formation scenarios is that lenses could be the remnants of a dissolved bar .",
    "here we show stellar population gradients that are compatible with this scenario as , otherwise , it would be difficult to obtain the change on the slope of the stellar population parameters at the radius we are observing them and the slightly positive metallicity gradient in the inner disc .",
    "in this paper we have presented an analysis of the star formation history and metallicity evolution in a 2-dimensional fashion for the galaxy ngc  628 , using data form the survey pings ( rosales - ortega et al .",
    "2010 ) with the main purpose of validate our techniques to derive reliable stellar population properties .",
    "* we derive 2d - star formation histories for ngc  628 using the code steckmap .",
    "the analysis allows to obtain mean ages and metallicities weighted with both , luminosity and stellar mass .",
    "* we check the robustness of the derived mean ages and metallicities to different choices of the fit . in particular",
    ", we have checked the effect of deriving simultaneously kinematics and metallicities , and also the effect or fitting or not the stellar continuum .",
    "we have found that , when the kinematics is fitted simultaneously to the derivation of star formation histories , the ages are not very affected , but the derived metallicities are . we have also found that the differences can be minimized in spectra with enough signal - to - noise . *",
    "we find a negative luminosity - age gradient compatible with an inside - out formation scenario ( e.g. , larson 1976 ; white & frenk 1991 ; mo et al .",
    "1998 ; naab & ostriker 2006 ; brook et al .",
    "however , even at @xmath02.0 scale - lengths the disc ( assuming a disc scale - length of 3.2 kpc ",
    "zou et al .",
    "2011 ) is dominated , in mass , by old stars ( @xmath010  gyr ) .",
    "* we find a metallicity gradient that is flatter in the internal region and change to a negative slope in the external parts .",
    "the break in the metallicity gradient is much more prominent in the old stars than in the younger components , which gradient is very similar to the gas - phase metallicity gradient .",
    "however , a break is visible in all the different components at about the same radius .",
    "we speculate that the metallicity gradient is the consequence of the gaseous flows and stellar migration produced by a @xmath21 perturbation , either the spiral pattern of a bar .",
    "however , the position of the break is more coincident with the corotation radius of the oval distortion than that of the spiral pattern , which is beyond the radius sampled by our data .",
    "as the oval distortion is ngc  628 is too weak for this to happen very efficiently , it could be that there was a stronger bar present in this galaxy and that the oval perturbation is the consequence of the dissolution of this structure .",
    "we also argue that this structure can not have evolved much in size in , at least , the last @xmath0 5 gyr .",

    "it is known that the measurement of the velocity dispersion depends on the metallicity of the stellar template ( laird & levison 1985 ; bender 1990 ; koleva , prugniel & de rijcke 2008 ) .",
    "a deeper absorption feature can be obtained by either increasing the metallicity of decreasing the broadening , which leads to degeneracies when trying to deriving both parameters at the same time . to quantify the differences in the derived parameters with and without fixing the kinematics , we have run steckmap allowing to fit both ,",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ compara_kin ] .    as can be seen , while the mean ages are not strongly affected by fixing or not the kinematics",
    ", the metallicities can be by as much as @xmath0 1 dex .",
    "the net effect is that , without fixing the kinematics , the metallicities tend to be lower .",
    "furthermore , there is a trend for which the differences increase with the mean metallicity of the population .",
    "we showed in snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that this effect is not exclusive of our employed technique to derive star formation histories , but that it is also seen if other codes , as starlight is used .",
    "the differences , also depend on the signal - to - noise . to further emphasize this",
    ", we also include some spectra resulting from a voronoi - binned spectra imposing a lower signal - to - noise cat ( showed with different symbols in the figure ) .",
    "it can be seen that the lower the signal - to - noise , the larger the differences .",
