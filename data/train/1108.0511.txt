    "it is now more than forty years since colgate @xmath2 white [ 1 ] and arnett [ 2 ] presented their classical work on energy transport by neutrinos and antineutrinos in non - rotating massive stars . despite immense technological advancements in recent times , the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae continues to challenge astrophysicists throughout the globe . when the iron core becomes unstable against the gravity force its inner portion undergoes homologous collapse whereas the outer portion collapses supersonically .",
    "the prompt shock that follows the bounce of the core stagnates ( as it looses energy due to neutrino emission and endothermic dissociation of heavy nuclei falling through the shock ) leading to a standing shock .",
    "some additional source of energy is required to revitalize the postshock gas .",
    "one interesting mechanism to revive the shock was the `` preheating '' mechanism proposed by haxton [ 3 ] .",
    "haxton suggested that a significant fraction of the energy carried by the neutrinos could be utilized in preheating iron nuclei outside the shock front rather than getting lost .",
    "this would lead to a reduction in the energy required from the shock wave to dissociate the infalling fe , assisting the shock wave to retain more of its strength as it propagates through the iron core and thus increasing the chances of transforming the collapse into an explosion .",
    "however , the preheating mechanism continues to be debated and the part played by neutrinos in this scenario is far from being completely understood .",
    "later , bruenn and haxton [ 4 ] worked on models simulating weak and strong shock cases and found out that in neither case is the energy transferred to the matter by neutrino - nucleus absorption significant in terms of preheating the infalling iron - like material .",
    "more recently , langanke and collaborators [ 5 ] had some observations on the models of bruenn and haxton [ 4 ] and reported much larger preshock heating rates .",
    "they concluded that these rates act for too short a time to lead to consequences for shock propagation . despite all this , the preheating mechanism in fact has been adopted by most coders , who are continually putting in more microphysics to make the simulations more realistic and there continues to be interest in this problem [ 6 ] .    during the late stages of evolution",
    ", a star mainly looses energy through neutrinos and this process is fairly independent of the mass of the star .",
    "white dwarfs and supernovae , both have cooling rates largely dominated by neutrino production .",
    "neutrinos are crucial to the life and afterlife of a supernova .",
    "it is natural to consider neutrino heating as a probable mechanism for shock revival as they dominate the energetics and dynamics of the post - bounce evolution . having only weak interactions , they are nature s most efficient means of cooling , transporting along around 99@xmath3 of the released gravitational energy . as such",
    "it is no wonder that astrophysicists find it a formidable task to simulate a 1@xmath3 effect of explosion .",
    "white dwarfs located in a binary system may end their lives in two possible ways .",
    "they may accrete from a companion and achieve the chandrasekhar mass thereby triggering a thermonuclear runaway of the object and ultimately exploding as a type ia supernova . in this case",
    "no remnant is left behind .",
    "alternatively these massive white dwarfs , for sufficiently high mass accretion rates , may allow the formation of o+ne+mg cores and due to the high prevailing central density ( beyond @xmath4 ) experience rapid electron capture that lead to the collapse of the core .",
    "this is termed as accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) .",
    "the end product is a neutron star ( in some double - degenerate scenario , two white dwarfs in a short - period binary system may eventually coalesce to form a massive white dwarf that exceeds the chandrasekhar mass limit and in this case transition to a black hole is possible if the total proto - neutron star mass exceeds the general - relativistic limit for gravitational stability [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the aic of white dwarfs represents one instance where a neutrino mechanism leads undoubtedly to a successful , albeit weak , explosion [ 8 ] .",
    "the authors in ref . [ 8 ] argued that the neutrino mechanism can successfully power explosions of low - mass progenitors and aics due to the limited mantle mass and steeply declining accretion rate .",
    "the ultimate fate of these white dwarfs are dependent on many factors , e.g. temperature of the environment , the mass accretion rate on the newly formed white dwarf , the mass of each partner white dwarf [ 7 ] and rapid electron capture rates [ 8 ] .",
    "the occurrence rate of the aic of white dwarfs is not determined reliably , and are not expected to occur more than once per 20  50 standard type ia events ( see for example [ 7 ] ) .",
    "supernovae are also tipped in as probable sites for the r - process .",
    "the production site of the heavy r - process nuclei is associated with the accretion - induced collapse of an oxygen - neon - magnesium ( o+ne+mg ) white dwarf in a binary system ( e.g. [ 9 ] ) or type - ii supernovae from 810 @xmath5 ( e.g. [ 10 ] ) .",
    "these 810 @xmath5 stars form an electron - degenerate o+ne+mg core that does not undergo further nuclear burning .",
    "a few collapse simulators ( e.g. hillebrandt et al . [ 11 ] ) demonstrated that the collapsing o+ne+mg core explodes promptly .",
    "others ( e.g. woosley and baron [ 12 ] ) showed that the shock generated at core bounce stalls rather than leading to a prompt explosion .",
    "delayed explosion scenario of these cores was also reported ( e.g. mayle and wilson [ 13 ] ) .",
    "wheeler and collaborators [ 14 ] have suggested that the exploding o+ne+mg core could be a viable site for the r - process . however",
    "the question of whether o+ne+mg cores can explode hydrodynamically continues to be argued .",
    "for example , gutirrez et al . [",
    "15 ] argued that the abundance of @xmath1 mg was considerably reduced in updated evolutionary calculations .",
    "however the procedure adopted by them was not fully consistent as they kept the ratio of oxygen to neon constant while parameterizing the abundance of @xmath1 mg .",
    "later kitaura et al .",
    "[ 16 ] presented simulation result of these cores ( keeping capture rates on @xmath1 mg as a key ingredient ) using an improved neutrino transport treatment .",
    "their outcome was not a prompt but a delayed explosion .",
    "a smaller iron core present at the onset of the core bounce as well as the smaller gravitational potential of the collapsing cores of a 810 @xmath5 star do favor a prompt explosion .",
    "what remains certain is that microscopic and reliable electron capture rates and neutrino energy loss rates are needed for a careful study of the late stages of the stellar evolution of 810 @xmath5 stars and can contribute effectively in the final outcome of the simulations of o+ne+mg cores on world s fastest supercomputers .",
    "electron capture rates and the accompanying neutrino energy loss rates of matter in nuclear statistical equilibrium under conditions of high temperatures and densities are of prime importance in determining the equation of state of exploding stars .",
    "an accurate determination of neutrino emission rates is mandatory in order to perform a careful analysis of the final branches of star evolutionary tracks .",
    "a change in the cooling rates at the very last stages of massive star evolution could affect the evolutionary time scale and the configuration of iron core at the onset of the supernova explosion .",
    "compared to shell model calculations by wildenthal et al .",
    "[ 17 ] , the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation theory ( pn - qrpa ) gives similar accuracy in the description of light nuclei including beta - decay rates in @xmath6-shell nuclide [ 18 ] .",
    "nabi and klapdor [ 19 ] , later , calculated weak interaction rates for 709 nuclei with a = 18 to 100 in stellar matter using the pn - qrpa theory .",
    "these included capture rates , decay rates , neutrino energy loss rates , probabilities of beta - delayed particle emissions and energy rate of these particle emissions ( see also refs . [ 20,21 ] ) . since",
    "then these calculations were further refined with use of more efficient algorithms , incorporation of latest data from mass compilations and experimental values , and fine - tuning of model parameters ( e.g. refs .",
    "[ 22  25 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the stars in the mass range 8 - 10 m@xmath0 develops central cores which are composed of @xmath7o , @xmath8ne and @xmath1 mg .",
    "oda et al . [ 26 ] pointed out three different series of electron capture in the o+ne+mg core of the 8 - 10 m@xmath0 stars and placed them in the order of low threshold energy as @xmath1 mg @xmath9 @xmath1na @xmath9 @xmath1ne , @xmath8ne @xmath9 @xmath8f @xmath9 @xmath8o , and @xmath7o @xmath9 @xmath7n @xmath9 @xmath7c .",
    "the first series was regarded most important as the trigger nucleus , @xmath1 mg , has the lowest electron capture threshold .",
    "oda and collaborators [ 26 ] actually renounced the last series in their calculations because of its high threshold energy which did not contribute significantly to the initiation of the collapse of the o+ne+mg core of the 8 - 10 m@xmath0 stars .",
    "the gamow - teller strength distributions in @xmath1 mg and the calculation of electron capture rates on @xmath1 mg using the pn - qrpa theory for o+ne+mg core simulations were presented earlier by nabi and rahman [ 23 ] . here",
    "i present for the first time the pn - qrpa calculations of the neutrino and antineutrino energy loss rates due to @xmath1 mg in stellar plasma on a detailed temperature - density grid suitable for the simulation codes of o+ne+mg cores . in order to further increase the reliability of the calculated neutrino energy loss rates ,",
    "i have incorporated all measured excitation energies ( along with their log @xmath10 values ) with definite spin and/or parity assignment , by either replacement ( when they were within 0.5 mev of each other ) or manual insertion .",
    "the deformation parameter , @xmath11 , is recently argued to be one of the most important parameters in qrpa calculations [ 27 ] .",
    "for the case of even - even nuclei , experimental deformations are available [ 28 ] and were employed in this work .",
    "all these steps were taken to ensure the most reliable calculation of pn - qrpa neutrino and antineutrino energy loss rates due to",
    "@xmath1 mg in presupernova and supernova environment .",
    "the paper is written as follows . section ii deals with the brief formalism of the pn - qrpa calculations .",
    "i present some of my calculated results in section iii .",
    "comparisons with earlier calculations is also included in this section .",
    "i finally conclude in section iv and at the end table ii presents the detailed calculation of neutrino and antineutrino energy loss rates due to @xmath1 mg suitable for simulation codes .",
    "i used the pn - qrpa theory with a separable interaction to calculate the neutrino and antineutrino energy losses in stellar matter .",
    "the hamiltonian of the problem was taken to be of the form : @xmath12    for the single - particle hamiltonian , @xmath13 , the single particle energies as well as wave functions were calculated in the nilsson model ( which takes into account nuclear deformations ) . the bcs model was used to calculate the pairing force , @xmath14 .",
    "two types of proton - neutron residual interactions were incorporated in these calculations namely the particle - hole , @xmath15 , and the particle - particle , @xmath16 , interaction .",
    "the two interactions ( separable in form ) were characterized by two interaction constants : @xmath17 ( for particle - hole interaction ) and @xmath18 ( for particle - particle interaction ) . in this work ,",
    "the values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 was taken as 0.001 mev and 0.05 mev , respectively .",
    "( the reader is referred to [ 18,29 ] for details of optimum selection of these parameters . )",
    "other parameters required for the calculation of weak rates are the deformation , the pairing gaps , and the q - value of the nuclear reactions .",
    "the calculated half - lives depend only weakly on the values of the pairing gaps [ 30 ] .",
    "thus , the traditional choice of @xmath19 was applied in the present work .",
    "the deformation parameter is as an important parameter for qrpa calculations as pairing [ 27 ] . as such rather than using deformations from some theoretical mass models ( as used in earlier calculations of pn - qrpa capture rates ) the experimentally adopted value of the deformation parameters for @xmath1 mg , extracted by relating the measured energy of the first @xmath20 excited state with the quadrupole deformation ,",
    "was taken from raman et al .",
    "q - values were taken from the recent mass compilation of audi et al .",
    "[ 31 ] .",
    "an estimation of uncertainties of the model and theoretical errors is important to establish the reliability of the calculated rates .",
    "the uncertainties related to the pn - qrpa model was discussed in detail in ref . [",
    "there the accuracy of the pn - qrpa model was compared to the experimental data for both @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions ( see table i and table ii of ref . [ 32 ] ) and an estimation of theoretical errors was given .",
    "the decay rate of even - even nuclei generally exhibits more or less a smooth behavior with respect to the deformation parameter ( see fig.2 of ref . [ 18 ] and discussions therein ) .",
    "the dependence of the half - life on the pairing gaps is small and rather smooth ( see fig . 3 of ref . [ 18 ] ) .",
    "the half - lives are not very sensitive to a change of the gamow - teller interaction strength @xmath17 within a reasonable range and the relationship is almost linear [ 18 ] . on the other hand for large values of @xmath18",
    "the lowest eigenvalue becomes complex .",
    "this indicates the `` collapse '' of the qrpa model and it is crucial to avoid values of @xmath18 which lie beyond the collapse .",
    "the redistribution of the @xmath23 strength and the reduction of the sum of the gamow - teller strength lead to a nonlinear dependence of the calculated half - lives as a function of @xmath18 [ 29 ] .",
    "( 7  10 ) of ref .",
    "[ 29 ] show in detail how the observables of the pn - qrpa calculations vary with changes in @xmath18 .",
    "these analysis do explain that a small and acceptable change in the qrpa parameters does not have a dramatic dependence on the calculated rates .",
    "the neutrino energy loss rates can occur through four different weak - interaction mediated channels : electron and positron emissions , and , continuum electron and positron captures .",

    "2 show four panels depicting the calculated neutrino and antineutrino energy loss rates , respectively , at selected temperature and density domain .",
    "it is pertinent to mention again that the neutrino energy loss rates ( depicted in fig.1 ) contain contributions due to electron capture _ and _ positron decay on @xmath1 mg whereas the antineutrino energy loss rates ( fig.2 ) are calculated due to contributions from positron capture _ and _ electron decay on @xmath1 mg .",
    "the upper left panel , in both figures , shows the energy loss rates in low - density region ( @xmath49 = 10^{0.5 } , 10^{1.5}$ ] and @xmath50 ) , the upper right in medium - low density region ( @xmath49 = 10^{3.5 } , 10^{4.5}$ ] and @xmath51 ) , the lower left in medium - high density region ( @xmath52 = 10^{6.5 } , 10^{7.5}$ ] and @xmath53 ) and finally the lower right panel depicts the calculated rates in high density region ( @xmath49 = 10^{9.5 } , 10^{10.5}$ ] and @xmath54 ) .",
    "the ( anti)neutrino energy loss rates are given in logarithmic scales ( to base 10 ) in units of @xmath55 .",
    "in the figures t@xmath56 gives the stellar temperature in units of @xmath57 k. one should note the order of magnitude differences in neutrino energy loss rates as the stellar temperature increases ( fig .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that in the low density region the energy loss rates , as a function of stellar temperatures , are more or less superimposed on one another .",
    "this means that there is no appreciable change in the neutrino energy loss rates when increasing the density by an order of magnitude .",
    "there is a sharp exponential increase in the neutrino energy loss rates for the low , medium - low and medium - high density regions as the stellar temperature increases to t@xmath56 = 5 .",
    "beyond this temperature the slope of the rates reduces drastically .",
    "one also observes that the neutrino energy loss rates are almost the same for the densities in the range @xmath58 as a function of stellar temperature . for a given temperature",
    "the neutrino energy loss rates increase monotonically with increasing densities .    as far as the antineutrino energy loss rates are concerned ( fig .",
    "2 ) one again notes that the rates increase very sharply as t@xmath56 approaches 5 .",
    "the rates are again almost superimposed on one another as a function of stellar densities .",
    "however as the stellar matter moves from the medium high density region to high density region these rates start to peel off from one another .",
    "the antineutrino production rates are dominated by the capture of positrons due to @xmath1 mg with a relatively smaller contribution coming from the beta - decay of @xmath1 mg ( see eqt .",
    "( 8) ) .",
    "the current calculation was also compared with two earlier calculations of neutrino and antineutrino energy loss rates due to @xmath1 mg .",
    "fuller , fowler and newman [ 36 ] ( hereafter ffn ) compiled the experimental data and calculated neutrino and antineutrino energy loss rates ( besides other weak - interaction mediated rates ) for the nuclei in the mass range a = 21 - 60 for an extended grid of temperature and density .",
    "the gt strength and excitation energies were calculated using a zero - order shell model . for the discrete transitions , for which the @xmath10 values were not available , ffn took log @xmath10 = 5.0 . later",

    "the left panel depicts the different calculated energy loss rates at density @xmath60 , the middle panel at density @xmath61 and the right panel at density @xmath62 .",
    "the shell model rates are usually in good comparison with the corresponding ffn rates .",
    "the calculated pn - qrpa rates are enhanced .",

    "26 ] and ffn [ 36 ] calculations . in the table @xmath63",
    "denotes the ratio of the reported neutrino energy loss rates to those calculated using the shell model whereas @xmath64 gives the corresponding ratio for the ffn calculations .",
    "the reported rates are more than a factor 15 enhanced as compared to the shell model rates in the presupernova conditions .",
    "the shell model rates are slightly enhanced at t@xmath56 = 30 ( at high densities the pn - qrpa neutrino energy loss rates again surpass the shell model rates ) .",
    "the collapse simulators should take note of this enhanced neutrino energy loss rates which favor cooler cores with a lower entropy .",
    "it is important to note from table i that , in comparison to previous calculations , the qrpa rates are most enhanced around t@xmath65 ( i.e. during the presupernova evolution of o+ne+mg cores ) .",
    "the ratio then starts decreasing with increasing t@xmath56 .",
    "the enhancement of the qrpa rates around t@xmath66 may be traced back to the enhanced electron capture rates on @xmath1 mg [ 37 ] leading to an enhanced production of non - thermal neutrinos around these temperatures .",
    "it may also be seen from table i that at high temperatures ( t@xmath67 ) the ratios are in good agreement with previous calculations .",
    "the story is different for the comparison of antineutrino energy loss rates ( fig.4 ) .",
    "this time the shell model rates and ffn rates are much more enhanced compared to pn - qrpa calculations .",
    "nevertheless the antineutrino energy loss rates are very small numbers and can change by orders of magnitude by a mere change of 0.5 mev , or less , in parent or daughter excitation energies and are more indicative of the uncertainties present in the calculation of the excitation energies .",

    "the ascii file of table ii is also available and can be received from the author upon request .",
    "there exists a wide variety of discrepant results in the supernova simulations of o+ne+mg cores including prompt explosions , delayed explosions and no explosions .",
    "varying results of the simulations of o+ne+mg cores ask for a more careful analysis of the precollapse evolution .",
    "a large number of input parameters are required for these simulations to run and a reliable calculation of these parameters can certainly reduce the large uncertainties involved .",
    "neutrino energy loss rates are one of the key input nuclear physics parameters responsible for cooling the stellar cores and thereby reducing its entropy . the pn - qrpa calculations of the neutrino energy loss rates due to @xmath1 mg are presented here on a detailed temperature - density grid suitable for simulation codes .",
    "the pn - qrpa calculations gives similar accuracy in reproducing weak interaction mediated rates in @xmath6-shell nuclide [ 18 ] and is employed here using maximum possible experimental incorporations to further increase the reliability of the calculated numbers .",
    "recent simulations of o+ne+mg cores [ 15,16 ] employ the weak interaction rates of shell model [ 38,26 ] , respectively .",
    "the reported neutrino energy loss rates are up to a factor of 15 enhanced as compared to shell model results .",
    "these enhanced numbers favor cooler cores with lower entropies .",
    "can the enhanced reported neutrino energy loss rates lead to any change in the outcome of simulation results on o+ne+mg cores ?",
    "let us recall that in the simulations neutrino heating is a favored mechanism for revival of the stalled shock wave .",

[ 32 ] ) employed preferably in a multi - dimensional model , with neutrino transport included consistently throughout the entire mass , accounting also for a complete treatment of multidimensional convection and burning phases might lead to some interesting outcome and answers .",
