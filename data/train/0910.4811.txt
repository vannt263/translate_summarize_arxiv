    "the purpose of the present paper is to clarify the physical meaning of the pseudovelocities of quantum walkers , which can have limit distributions in the weak sense even in the quantum systems , and the origin of the inverted - bell shape of the limit distribution with bounded supports .",
    "our argument is based on the resemblance between the quantum walk models and time - evolutions of multi - component wave functions in the _ relativistic quantum mechanics _ @xcite . since @xmath101 given by ( [ eqn : v1 ] ) is a unitary matrix , we can assign a hermitian matrix @xmath102 such that @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a constant , the planck constant divided by @xmath105 , and then the time evolution ( [ eqn : psik ] ) of the sqw can be regarded as a solution of the equation @xmath106 here time @xmath48",

    "note that the weyl equation and the dirac equation are the time - evolution equations for massless and massive relativistic particles in quantum mechanics , both in the three - dimensional continuous space @xmath112 .",

    "then we show that it can provide a model describing motion of a quantum walker having a four - component qubit by identifying the time - evolution matrix ( [ eqn : v1 ] ) with the hamiltonian matrix for the dirac equation explicitly",
    ". then we study the long - time behavior of the moments of pseudovelocity for a free dirac particle starting from the origin .",
    "our initial state will be considered as an ideal limit of the highly localized state studied by bracken , flohr , and melloy @xcite . in this situation",
    "we clarify the fact that the pseudovelocity is exactly equal to the _",
    "relativistic velocity_. since the dirac particle as well as our quantum walker should be _ a tardyon , not a tachyon _ , its velocity is less than the speed of light @xmath12 , @xmath113 this is the physical origin of the finiteness of supports in the limit distributions of @xmath9 universally found in quantum walk models . in order to ensure the convergence of integrals giving joint moments of @xmath114 in @xmath59",
    ", we have to introduce an ultraviolet cutoff in the theory , which will correspond to the fact that quantum walk models are defined on discrete spaces such as , lattices and trees .",
    "the introduction of an ultraviolet cutoff here will be equivalent with replacement of the delta - function - like initial state by a wave packet with a finite size as studied by strauch @xcite for the one - dimensional systems ( see sec.iii c ) . in sec.iii , we modify the dirac equations by reducing the number of components of momentum to describing the quantum walk models in the dimensions lower than @xmath115 .",

    "<S> the limit distributions have novel structures such that they are inverted - bell shaped and the supports of them are bounded . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> we claim that these properties of the sqw@xmath1 can be explained by the theory of relativistic quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the dirac equation with a proper ultraviolet cutoff can provide a quantum walk model in three dimensions , where the walker has a four - component qubit . </S>",
    "<S> we clarify that the pseudovelocity @xmath9 of the quantum walker , which solves the dirac equation , is identified with the relativistic velocity . since the quantum walker should be a tardyon , not a tachyon , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the speed of light , and this restriction ( the causality ) is the origin of the finiteness of supports of the limit distributions universally found in quantum walk models . by reducing the number of components of momentum in the dirac equation </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the limit distributions of pseudovelocities for the lower dimensional quantum walks . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the obtained limit distributions for the one- and two - dimensional systems have the common features with those of sqw@xmath13 and sqw@xmath14 . </S>"
