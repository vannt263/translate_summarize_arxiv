    "in contrast to multiply - imaged , compact flat - spectrum sources , strongly - lensed extended , steep spectrum sources occupy a distinctly inferior position in the gravitational lens pantheon . yet , in a paper that marks the beginning of the modern era in gravitational lensing , @xcite argued that radio lobes were the most promising targets in searching for lensing .",
    "indeed , examples in their figure6 resemble the lens which is the study of this paper , but since that paper was written , lensed lobes have proven more difficult to interpret .",
    "chief among the difficulties is the continuing poor registration between the radio and optical reference frames @xcite .",
    "radio lobes tend not to have optical emission that allows their position to be determined with respect to any lensing galaxy that might be identified .",
    "as lobes are extended and polarized , they offer more potential constraints than multiply imaged point sources , but modelling such emission requires substantial machinery @xcite . for the most part , lensed lobes have been passed over in favor of their compact flat - spectrum cousins .",
    "we describe in this paper merlin and vla observations of the doubly - lensed double radio hotspot j0816 + 5003 ( a.k.a .",
    "6c0812 + 501 ) discovered both by @xcite , using a clever automated strategy for finding extended radio emission which is gravitationally lensed , and independently by the oxford group searching for high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "the techniques for high redshift radio galaxy searches include filtering on the basis of steep radio spectra and small angular size ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the course filtering radio source surveys to optimize seaches for high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "j0816 + 5003 is an example of a candidate included in the initial search but subsequently excluded by the filtering criteria .",
    "the lens we study in this paper is the hotspot complex within the northern lobe of the giant radio galaxy j0816 + 5003 , which has an angular extent of over an arcminute and is pictured in figure1 of @xcite .",
    "both the associated radio core , a half arcminute away to the south west , and its optical counterpart are identified , allowing accurate registration of the lensed hotspot and the lensing galaxy .",
    "in addition we find , with higher resolution radio imaging than was available to @xcite , that the hotspot has two components both of which are doubly imaged .",
    "finally , the lensed images are asymmetrically located with respect to the lensing galaxy , permitting determination of the radial profile of the lensing potential . in particular , the images of the two sources span a factor of two in radius on one side of the galaxy at impact parameters of less than 500pc .",
    "this , together with accurate radio and optical astrometric registration as well as higher resolution radio images than were available to @xcite , enables us to make a pure - lensing measurement of the slope of the potential of the _ total mass _ of the lensing galaxy on the scales probed , including the dark matter . by combining lensing and dynamical analyses ,",
    "the slacs team have investigated this and other properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the slope of the potential figures prominently both in measurements of the hubble constant and in discussions of the mass profiles of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "there are very few examples where one can measure the slopes in this way  some exceptions include mg1654 + 134 @xcite , 0957 + 561 @xcite , mg2016 + 112 @xcite , b1152 + 199 @xcite , but cf .",
    "b1933 + 503 @xcite and especially pg1115 + 080 @xcite .",
    "some newly found lenses by the slacs team have also yielded constraints on the slope , albeit in most cases by a comparision of stellar velocity dispersions and einstein ring radii @xcite .    with regard to measurement of @xmath1 , a very small fraction of systems",
    "are suitable for measurement of time delays but as mentioned above , only a small fraction of systems are suitable for measurement of the slope of the potential . since the overlap of these two sets is slim , it remains important to glean as much as possible about the slopes of galaxies potentials and extrapolate from the former to the latter @xcite .",
    "the currently accepted value of @xmath1 is reconcilable with inferred values from the 10 firm time - delay measurements in gravitational lenses only if dark matter halos are eliminated and a constant mass - to - light ratio used .",
    "j0816 + 5003 was observed for 2 minutes on 1996 dec 06 in the a - configuration of the very large array ( hereafter vla ) at 5ghz under program code ar365 originally as part of an oxford survey for high redshift radio galaxies .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures in the aips software package .",
    "the primary flux calibrator was 3c286 and the phase calibrator was 0804 + 499 .",
    "the image showing its lensed northern hotspot structure is shown in figure[fig : vla_wht ] .      to obtain higher resolution radio imaging than in figure[fig : vla_wht ] , j0816 + 5003 was observed with six antennas of the multi - element linked radio interferometer ( hereafter merlin ) at 1.7ghz on 1997 jun 27 for 10.58 hrs , during which observations of a nearby phase calibrator , b0803 + 514 , were interleaved .",
    "again , the data were reduced using standard procedures within aips including standard polarimetric calibration made possible by the extensive parallactic angle coverage of the phase calibrator throughout the 10 + hour observation .",
    "figures[fig : blobby ] and [ fig : squash ] show contours of the total intensity merlin data in different ways as described in the figure captions , with the highest resolution image having a point spread function with fwhm of @xmath2 .      in order to establish the nature of any galaxy",
    "associated with 6c0816 + 5003 , this source was observed for 5 minutes in @xmath3-band on 1997 jan 9 on the william herschel telescope ( hereafter wht ) using the aux port camera , and was flat - fielded and reduced using standard procedures .",
    "a greyscale of this image is presented in figure[fig : vla_wht ] .",
    "near - infra red k - band observations of j0816 + 5003 were made using the ufti instrument for 27 minutes on the united kingdom infra - red telescope ( hereafter ukirt ) on 2002 jan 13 .",
    "unfortunately conditions were not photometric , but approximate flux density boot strapping was made via a short ( 9-minute ) service observation on 2002 mar 11 .",
    "for each of these observations , following standard practice , each successive 60-sec exposure was jittered from the previous position and a flat - field was created by combining all frames from a particular observation using a median filter .",
    "all data reduction was performed in iraf and followed @xcite .",
    "the isis spectrograph on the wht was used on 2002 feb 5 using the red and blue arms of the isis spectrograph ( with r158r and b300b gratings respectively ) , in order to find the redshifts of the background source , namely the radio galaxy , and the lensing galaxy .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf procedures .",
    "the redshift of the lensing galaxy is inferred to be 0.332 , on the basis of an observed 4000  break and the ca h and k absorption lines ( at 3968 and 3933 ",
    "respectively ) shortward of this . at this redshift",
    ", @xmath4 is 4.738kpc assuming @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the background source , being a radio galaxy , belongs to a relatively homogeneous category of sources with respect to its host galaxy .",
    "this is displayed most apparently by the tightness of the radio galaxy k - z relation @xcite .",
    "indeed , with work on the radio galaxy @xmath8@xmath9 hubble relation @xcite we are able to make a crude estimate of the redshift of the radio source .",
    "a magnitude of @xmath10 from the ukirt observations implies a redshift of @xmath11 , which is also consistent with its broad - band optical colours .",
    "we can also gain more information from the optical wht spectrum , where the presence of a relatively bright continuum but the absence of any of the bright forbidden narrow - emission lines , implies that the radio galaxy probably lies within the redshift desert at @xmath12 ( i.e.  [ oii ] 3727 has been redshifted out of , and ly@xmath13 has yet to enter , the optical passband ) .",
    "while the @xmath8-band magnitude indicates that the radio galaxy is probably at @xmath14 , the wht spectrum tentatively indicates that @xmath15 .",
    "thus , we can be certain that the radio galaxy is at a much greater distance than the lens .",
    "to deduce accurately the slope of the potential of the lensing galaxy requires secure relative astrometry between the images and the lenses . in the case of pg1115 + 080 , a difference in the image positions of several parts in a thousand makes a difference between a best - fit power - law slope of @xmath16 rather than @xmath17 @xcite , which relates to the surface mass density profile with radius @xmath18 as @xmath19 . in the case of j0816 + 5003 ,",
    "the lensed images are only detectable in the radio waveband and the lensing galaxies is not visible in the radio .",
    "thus , making deductions about the slope of the power - law of the galaxy lensing its hotspot depends on how well the radio and the optical / near - ir frames can be tied together . the derivation of astrometric solutions using an image from a telescope with reimaging optics or with a prime focus corrector ( such as the wht , ukirt or keck ) and with a reference from the usno catalog would not be sufficiently successful , due to off - axis distortions .",
    "a @xmath20 @xmath3-band image of this field was observed with the michigan - dartmouth - mit 1.3 m telescope ( hereafter mdm-1.3 m ) by jules halpern on 2002 feb 22 .",
    "the astrometry of this image was fitted with john thorstensen s automated astrometric program which matched 156 bright stars over this field from the usno catalog and put the astrometric solution into the fits headers .",
    "this astrometric solution was transferred to a @xmath21 pixel @xmath3-band image obtained from the wiyn with 0.5@xmath22 seeing on 2002 mar 14 .",
    "the wiyn and mdm scales were both determined from fits which assumed that the scale was the same in both directions .",
    "the scale factor in both cases was determined to better than 1 part in @xmath23 .",
    "the postional rms between the wiyn and mdm objects was 0.34 pixels which at a scale of 0.1406189@xmath22/pix is roughly 0.05@xmath22 .",
    "thirty six stars were used in the wiyn fit .",
    "the error in the galaxy position was taken to be 0.05 pixel ( as judged from the scatter in the different position measurements ) that translates into a 0.007@xmath22 error in the lens position ( in each direction ) .",
    "the right ascensions and declinations of the lensing galaxy and of the radio galaxy core and their relative separation were measured using an average of three differences obtained from daofind , imexam and vista and are reproduced in table[tab : positions ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < , > \" , ]",
    "the use of a particular gravitational lens system in deducing @xmath1 is only as good as our knowledge of the lensing potential . the galaxy responsible for lensing the hotspot in j0816 + 5003 has a power - law which is remarkably close to isothermal .",
    "in addition , it is unlikely that the lensing potential is much shallower than isothermal because there is no hint of evidence for any odd ( e.g.  ` third ' ) image @xcite .",
    "the flux density ratio of the peak of the brighter northern ( n2-e ) blob on the merlin image to @xmath24 the rms noise on this image exceeds 10 .",
    "@xcite , similarly , finds that in mg1654 + 134 that @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite find in b1152 + 199 that @xmath26 and @xcite find in mg2016 + 112 that @xmath27 .",
    "however , seemingly inconsistently with this emerging general picture , @xcite claim that the mass profile of the lensing galaxy in mg1131 + 0456 to be incompatible with @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , for pg 1115 + 080 @xcite report that no viable lens model can yet be ruled out .",
    "sensitive radio images at resolution better than a few 10s of milli - arcsec would considerably broaden the scope of a lensing model to be fitted , and this is within the capability of current technology .",
    "the key observational limitation however , remains the registation of the optical frame with respect to the radio frame and widespread efforts to improve this situation generally should remain a priority .",
    "we conclude by remarking that our pure - lensing measurement of slope of the potential of the lensing galaxy in this system as being very close to isothermal is a measurement of the _ total mass _ on the scales probed , including the dark matter .",
    "however , it sheds no light on the `` bulge - halo conspiracy '' that separately the dark and light matter do not appear to be isothermal  the light matter being steeper than isothermal , the dark matter being shallower @xcite  but collectively they appear isothermal over an increasing range in redshift as the system we have studied in this paper illustrates .",
