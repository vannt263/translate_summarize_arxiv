    "however , new theoretical methods capable of computing the force in arbitrary geometries have already begun to explore the strong geometry dependence of the force and have demonstrated a number of interesting effects  @xcite .",
    "a substantial motivation for the study of this effect is due to recent progress in the field of nano - technology , especially in the fabrication of micro - electro - mechanical systems ( mems ) , where casimir forces have been observed  @xcite and may play a significant role in `` stiction '' and other phenomena involving small surface separations .",
    "currently , most work on casimir forces is carried out by specialists in the field . in order to help open this field to other scientists and engineers , such as the mems community ,",
    "we believe it fruitful to frame the calculation of the force in a fashion that may be more accessible to broader audiences .    in  ref .",
    ", with that goal in mind , we introduced a theoretical framework for computing casimir forces via the standard finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method of classical computational electromagnetism  @xcite ( for which software is already widely available ) .",
    "the purpose of this manuscript is to describe how these computations may be implemented in higher dimensions and to demonstrate the flexibility and strengths of this approach . in particular , we demonstrate calculations of casimir forces in two- and three - dimensional geometries , including three - dimensional geometries without any rotational or translational symmetry .",
    "furthermore , we describe a harmonic expansion technique that substantially increases the speed of the computation for many systems , allowing casimir forces to be efficiently computed even on single computers , although parallel fdtd software is also common and greatly expands the range of accessible problems .",

    "these calculations demonstrate both the validity of our approach and the desirable properties of the harmonic expansion . in subsequent sections ,",
    "we demonstrate computations exploiting various symmetries in three dimensions : translation - invariance , cylindrical symmetry , and periodic boundaries . these symmetries transform the calculation into the solution of a set of two - dimensional problems . finally in  sec .",

    ", we described a method to calculate casimir forces in the time domain .",
    "our approach involves a modification of the well - known stress - tensor method  @xcite , in which the force on an object can be found by integrating the minkowski stress tensor around a surface @xmath1 surrounding the object (  fig .",
    "[ fig : dblocks ] ) , and over all frequencies .",
    "our recent approach  @xcite abandons the frequency domain altogether in favor of a purely time - domain scheme in which the force on an object is computed via a series of independent fdtd calculations in which sources are placed at each point on @xmath1 .",
    "the electromagnetic response to these sources is then integrated in time against a predetermined function @xmath2 .",

    "this dissipation will cause the electromagnetic response to converge rapidly , greatly reducing the simulation time .",
    "in particular , a frequency - independent , spatially uniform conductivity @xmath5 is chosen so that the force will converge very rapidly as a function of simulation time .",
    "for all values of @xmath5 , the force will converge to the same value , but the optimal @xmath5 results in the shortest simulation time and will depend on the system under consideration . unless otherwise stated , for the simulations in this paper , we use @xmath6 ( in units of @xmath7 , @xmath3 being a typical length scale in the problem ) .    in particular , the casimir force is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath0 is a geometry - independent function discussed further in the appendix , and the @xmath9 are functions of the electromagnetic fields on the surface @xmath1 defined in our previous work  @xcite .    written in terms of the electric field response in direction @xmath10 at @xmath11 to a source current @xmath12 in direction @xmath13 , @xmath14 , the quantity @xmath15",

    ", computation of the casimir force entails finding both @xmath23 and the @xmath24 field response with a separate time - domain simulation for every point @xmath25 .    while each individual simulation can be performed very efficiently on modern computers , the surface @xmath1 will , in general , consist of hundreds or thousands of pixels or voxels",
    "this requires a large number of time - domain simulations , this number being highly dependent upon the resolution and shape of @xmath1 , making the computation potentially very costly in practice .",
    "we can dramatically reduce the number of required simulations by reformulating the force in terms of a harmonic expansion in @xmath23 , involving the distributed field responses to distributed currents .",

    "summing over all harmonic moments will yield the total force .    in the following section",
    ", we take as our harmonic source basis the fourier cosine series for each side of @xmath1 considered separately , which provides a convenient and efficient basis for computation .",
    "we then illustrate its application to systems of perfect conductors and dielectrics in two and three dimensions .",

    ", our ability to express the force for a dissipationless system ( perfect - metal blocks in vacuum ) in terms of the response of an artificial dissipative system @xmath59 means that the fields , such as those shown in  fig .",

    "in addition ,  fig .  [",
    "fig : harmonic - convergence ] shows the convergence of the harmonic expansion as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "asymptotically for large @xmath41 , an @xmath60 power law is clearly discernible .",
    "the explanation for this convergence follows readily from the geometry of @xmath1 : the electric field @xmath61 , when viewed as a function along @xmath1 , will have nonzero first derivatives at the corners .",

    "one could instead consider a fourier series defined around the whole perimeter of @xmath1 , but the convergence rate will be the same because the derivatives of the fields will be discontinuous around the corners of @xmath1 .",
    "a circular surface would have no corners in the continuous case , but on a discretized grid would effectively have many corners and hence poor convergence with resolution .     in the cosine basis to the total casimir force for the double blocks configuration ( shown in the inset),scaledwidth=48.0% ]      dispersion in fdtd in general requires fitting an actual dispersion to a simple model ( eg .",

    "if it consisted only of perfect conductors , we could use the trick of the previous section and compute the force in only one 2d simulation .",
    "however , dielectrics hybridize the two polarizations and require an explicit @xmath72 integral , as discussed in  ref .  .",
    "each value of @xmath72 corresponds to a separate two - dimensional simulation with bloch - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the value of the force for each @xmath72 is smooth and rapidly decaying , so in general only a few @xmath72 points are needed .    to simulate the infinite open space around the waveguides",
    ", it is ideal to have `` absorbing boundaries '' so that waves from sources on @xmath1 do no reflect back from the boundaries .",
    "we employ the standard technique of perfectly matched layers ( pml ) , which are a thin layer of artificial absorbing material placed adjacent to the boundary and designed to have nearly zero reflections  @xcite .",

    "we also show ( in blue ) the force obtained using the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) calculations based on the lifshitz formula  @xcite .",
    "for the pfa , we assume two parallel silicon plates , infinite in both directions perpendicular to the force and having the same thickness as the waveguides in the direction parallel to the force , computing the pfa contribution from the surface area of the waveguide .",
    "as expected , at distances smaller than the waveguide width , the actual and pfa results are in good agreement , while as the waveguide separation increases , the pfa becomes more inaccurate .",
    "for example , by a separation of 300 nm , the pfa result is off by 50@xmath73 .",

    "when this is the case , the implementation of cylindrical symmetry is almost identical to the two - dimensional situation .",

    "in  ref .   we introduced a geometry - independent function @xmath0 , which resulted from the fourier transform of a certain function of frequency , termed @xmath117 , which is given by  @xcite : @xmath118 once @xmath0 is known , it can be integrated against the fields in time , allowing one to compute a decaying time - series which will , when integrated over time , yield the correct casimir force .",
    "@xmath117 has the behavior that it diverges in the high - frequency limit . for large @xmath119",
    ", @xmath117 has the form : @xmath120 viewing @xmath121 as a function , we could only compute its fourier transform @xmath122 by introducing a cutoff in the frequency integral at the nyquist frequency , since the time signal is only defined up to a finite sampling rate and the integral of a divergent function may appear to be undefined in the limit of no cutoff .    applying this procedure to compute @xmath2 yields a time series that has strong oscillations at the nyquist frequency .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations can be quite high , increasing the time needed to obtain convergence and also making any physical interpretation of the time series more difficult .",
    "these oscillations are entirely due to the high - frequency behavior of @xmath117 , where @xmath123 .",
    "however , @xmath0 and @xmath117 only appear when when they are being integrated against smooth , rapidly decaying field functions @xmath124 or @xmath125 . in this case",
    ", @xmath126 can be viewed as a tempered distribution ( such as the @xmath31-function )  @xcite .",
    "although @xmath117 diverges for large @xmath119 , this divergence is only a power law , so it is a tempered distribution and its fourier transform is well - defined without any truncation . in particular , the fourier transform of @xmath121 is given by : @xmath127    adding and subtracting the term @xmath121 from @xmath128 , the remaining term decays to zero for large @xmath119 and can be fourier transformed numerically without the use of a high - frequency cutoff , allowing @xmath2 to be computed as the sum of @xmath122 plus the fourier transform of a well - behaved function .",
    "this results in a much smoother @xmath2 which will give the same final force as the @xmath2 used in  ref .  , but will also have a much more well - behaved time dependence .    in  fig .",
    "[ fig : gt - new ] we plot the convergence of the force as a function of time for the same system using the @xmath2 obtained by use of a high - frequency cutoff and for one in which @xmath121 is transformed analytically and the remainder is transformed without a cutoff .",

    "in addition to the treatment of the high - frequency divergence in the previous section , we find it convenient to also fourier transform the low - frequency singularity of @xmath117 analytically . as discussed in  ref .  , the low - frequency limit of @xmath117 is given by : @xmath131      after removing both the high- and low - frequency divergences of @xmath117 , we perform a numerical fourier transform on the function @xmath134 , which is well - behaved in both the high- and low - frequency limits .    in the present text we are only concerned with real sources , in which case all fields @xmath124 are real and only the imaginary part of @xmath2 contributes to the force in  equation  ( [ eq : time - force ] ) . the imaginary part of @xmath2 is then :        as discussed in  ref .",
    ", the stress - tensor frequency integral for a three - dimensional @xmath51-invariant system involving only vacuum and perfect metallic conductors is identical in value to the integral of the stress tensor for the associated two - dimensional system ( corresponding to taking a @xmath136 crossection ) , with an extra factor of @xmath137 in the frequency integrand . in the time domain",
    ", this corresponds to solving the two - dimensional system with a new @xmath2 .",
    "the extension of the above derivation to three dimensions and non - cartesian coordinate systems is straightforward , as the only difference is in the representation of the @xmath31-function .",
    "because the case of rotational invariance presents some simplification , we will explicitly present the result for this case below .    for cylindrical symmetry",
    ", we work in cylindrical coordinates @xmath138 and choose a surface @xmath1 that is also rotationally invariant about the @xmath51-axis .",

    "the most practical harmonic expansion basis consists of functions of the form @xmath140 . given a @xmath75 dependence , many fdtd solvers",
    "will solve a modified set of maxwell s equations involving only the @xmath76 coordinates . in this case , for each @xmath77 the problem is reduced to a two - dimensional problem where both sources and fields are specified only in the @xmath76-plane .",
    "once the fields are determined in the @xmath76-plane , the force contribution for each @xmath77 is given by : @xmath141 where the values of @xmath20 range over the full three - dimensional @xmath138 system . here",
    "we introduce the cartesian line element @xmath82 along the one - dimensional surface @xmath1 in anticipation of the cancellation of the jacobian factor @xmath142 from the integration over @xmath1 .",
    "we have explicitly written only the contribution for @xmath63 , the contribution for @xmath143 being identical in form",
    ".      for simplicity , assume that @xmath1 consists entirely of @xmath145 constant and @xmath146 constant surfaces ( the more general case follows by an analogous derivation ) . in these cases ,",

    "( [ eq : cyl - force - m ] ) , we obtain a cancellation with the first @xmath142 factor .",
    "now , one picks an appropriate decomposition of @xmath30 into functions @xmath148 ( a choice of @xmath149 const or @xmath150 const merely implies that the @xmath148 will either be functions of @xmath51 , or @xmath83 , respectively ) .",
    "we denote either case as @xmath35 , with the @xmath83 and @xmath51 dependence implicit .      as noted in the text ,",
    "@xmath153 is simply the field measured in the fdtd simulation due to a three - dimensional current source of the form @xmath154 . in the case of cylindrical symmetry",
    ", this field must have a @xmath75 dependence of the form @xmath74 : @xmath155    this factor of @xmath74 cancels with the remaining @xmath156 .",
    "the integral over @xmath75 then produces a factor of @xmath157 that cancels the one introduced by @xmath30 .",
    "after removing these factors , the problem is reduced to one of integrating the field responses entirely in the @xmath76 plane .",
