    "the spectroweb database is an online repository of identified spectral lines and features observed in spectral standard reference stars .",
    "it is permanently updated and improved , currently providing high - resolution spectra of six bright ( cool ) stars selected as primary spectroscopic reference objects : betelgeuse ( @xmath0 ori ; m2 iab ) , arcturus ( @xmath0 boo ; k1 iii ) , the sun ( g2 v ) , @xmath1 aqr ( g0 ib ) , procyon ( @xmath0 cmi a ; f5 iv - v ) , and canopus ( @xmath0 car ; f0 ii ) .",
    "their effective temperatures differ by about 1000 k , ranging from 3500 k ( m - type ) to 7500 k ( f - type ) .",
    "these stars offer a broad range of thermal conditions for the identification of mainly neutral and singly ionized spectral lines formed in their atmospheres .",
    "spectroweb offers a comprehensive interactive database of identified spectral lines that relies on detailed comparisons of observed spectra with advanced spectrum synthesis calculations . with its graphics display users",
    "can zoom in on the same wavelength regions of interest in different stars to investigate changes of line intensities , and to directly assess the reliability of the line identifications and the quality of the corresponding atomic line data .",

    "the database s graphics interface requires a modern internet browser with an activated java language interpreter .",
    "the object - oriented ( java ` applet ' ) implementation , for example , permits to securely link many digital spectral atlases in a single database that is served from various world - wide - web domains using a standard interactive display .",
    "a concise description of the current spectroweb 1.0 implementation and its basic query interactions is provided in @xcite .",

    "a discussion of the latter four spectra will be given elsewhere .",
    "it is more important to point out that the increase of about 1000 k between these stars towards earlier spectral types yields strong changes in the optical spectrum due to large changes of the stellar atmospheric ionization balance .",
    "for the coolest stars line blending strongly increases towards shorter wavelengths , resulting in a large decrease of the local continuum flux level to below the stellar continuum level . for m - supergiant betelgeuse the optical spectrum is dominated by molecular opacity and mainly due to tio .",

    "it involves an iterative fit procedure whereby the differences of relative line depths between the observed and computed high - resolution spectra are minimized .",

    "we also measure an over - estimate of the vald log(gf)-values in our sample of ni  i lines , although it covers a considerably smaller range of log(gf)-values than the fe  i sample .",
    "we find that the log(gf)-values of primarily weak lines , with normalized central line depths below 15  % , are on average over - estimated in the vald database .",
    "figure  5 shows a plot of the lines in fig .",
    "4 with the measured log(gf)-correction ( @xmath14log(gf ) equals the log(gf)-value of spectroweb minus the vald log(gf)-value ) compared to the normalized line depth .",
    "we observe the trend of over - estimated vald log(gf)-values in weak lines of all iron - group elements for which we measure a sufficiently large number of lines . on the other hand , for the medium - strong and strong lines ( e.g. with line depths @xmath15 20  % ) our log(gf)-measurements yield almost equal amounts of lines for which the vald values are over- and under - estimated . in fig .",

    "the stronger lines require @xmath14log(gf)@xmath160 ( _ open triangles _ ) and @xmath14log(gf)@xmath170 ( _ filled symbols _ ) corrections for comparable amounts of lines to best fit the observed solar spectrum .",
    "a similar trend of over - estimated log(gf)-values from vald for weak lines of lighter elements ( @xmath18@xmath1621 ) is statistically not significantly detectable because our sample of lines is too small .",
    "we find this with the exception of the neutral lines of @xmath0-element si in the sun .",
    "for 60 weak _ and _ medium - strong si  i lines in a sample of 65 si  i lines ( fig .",
    "7 ) we measure @xmath14log(gf)@xmath160 ( _ upper panel _ ) .",
    "although the number of 65 si  i lines is rather limited we find that the log(gf)-values of both weak _ and _ medium - strong lines are significantly over - estimated in vald because there are tight dependences between the corrected log(gf)-values and the computed line depths for si  i lines belonging to the same multiplets .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "7 shows these dependences which are related to the curve - of - growth of the line equivalent widths .",
    "possible shortcomings in our atmospheric model structures or spectral synthesis calculations can not readily explain a systematic over - estimation of the vald log(gf)-values for weak neutral lines of iron - group elements in the sun and procyon .",
    "important systematic effects due to non - lte and the chromosphere are expected for strong lines rather than for weak lines .",
    "a decrease of the model abundances of all iron - group elements would systematically decrease the over - estimated line depths we compute with the vald log(gf)-values for weak lines in our sample .",
    "however , lowering the abundances of all iron - group elements is not an option since a decrease of @xmath30.2 dex is currently adopted for fe only @xcite .",
    "an abundance decrease for iron - group elements would also offset numerous lines in our theoretical spectra that do correctly match the observed spectra and that are exempt from our sample of 1178 corrected lines .",
    "we also perform spectral synthesis calculations with the more recent opacity distribution functions of @xcite , but which could not remove this trend .",
    "a far more likely source for the trend is the limited accuracy of small log(gf)-values for weak lines offered in vald .",
    "for example , we find that 14 fe  i and 7 si  i lines must be removed from the vald line list because they are not observed in the sun and procyon .",
    "it points to problems with advanced calculations of semi - empriric ( approximate ) line oscillator strengths for complex model atoms of the iron - group elements .",
    "the accuracy of the predicted log(gf)-values for many lines of these complicated atoms is limited , and we find that they are systematically over - estimated for weak neutral lines .",
    "an explanation for the over - estimated vald log(gf)-values for our sample of si  i lines is less clear because many other si  i lines do correctly fit the solar spectrum using vald data .",
    "we think however that it results from problems with a small number of multiplets from high energy levels ( @xmath19@xmath205 - 6 ev ) in the neutral si atom , yielding oscillator strength values in vald of low accuracy for both weak and medium - strong lines .",
    "we measure the log(gf)-values of 1178 atomic absorption lines we identify in the sun with advanced synthetic spectrum calculations .",
    "the new log(gf)-values of 660 lines are verified in procyon .",
    "the measured log(gf)-values are available in the online spectroweb database and are corrections of the values provided in vald .",
    "we find systematic over - estimations of the vald values for many weak neutral lines of iron - group elements , and for a smaller sample of weak and medium - strong si  i lines .",
    "the log(gf ) over - estimations are attributed to the limited accuracy of small log(gf)-values for weak lines presently offered in vald .",
    "the oscillator strengths of many weak and strong lines in both stars require further updates for reliable future line identifications .",
