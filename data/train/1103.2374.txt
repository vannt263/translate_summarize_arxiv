    "recently , the near - field radiative heat transfer has attracted a lot of theoretical and experimental attention  @xcite .",
    "it was predicted theoretically  @xcite and shown experimentally  @xcite that the heat flux for distances much smaller than the thermal wavelength @xmath0 can be much greater than that predicted by planck s law , where @xmath1 is planck s constant , @xmath2 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath3 is the velocity of light in vacuum and @xmath4 the temperature .",

    "while the effect on far - field properties has been widely studied  @xcite , the impact of surface roughness on near - field heat transfer has not been considered so far . from the experimentalist s point of view , at least an estimate of the surface roughness correction is desirable , since one is confronted with a certain degree of surface roughness in all experimental set - ups .    in this work",
    "we will study the near - field heat transfer between a nanoparticle considered to be an electric dipole and a material with a rough surface . within this model",
    "the change of the local density of states ( ldos ) above the material due to the surface roughness completely causes the change in the heat flux . since , the near - field heat transfer between two semi - infinite bodies is also largely determined by the ldos , we think that our results are not only restricted to the here discussed geometry , but can also be utilized to get a rough estimate of the impact of surface roughness for configurations used in recent experimental setups  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ldos also plays a fundamental role for other physical phenomena as it determines , for instance , the lifetime of atoms and molecules near a surface , so that the here given results for the ldos have a wider range of application .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "this surface wave mediated decrease of the reflectivity can be seen for both s- and p - polarization .",
    "the possibility of exciting surface polaritons with s - polarized light needs some explanation , since after taking the ensemble average , the rough surface has the same symmetries as a flat surface for which surface polaritons can be excited with p - polarised light only .",

    "when these two conditions are met  @xcite , an s - polarized wave can excite surface polaritons .",

    "this behaviour is due to the scattering of surface phonons discussed in the previous section resulting in a broadened surface phonon dispersion .",
    "let us now focus on the distance dependence of the ldos . for rough surfaces",
    "it can be expected that the roughness correction of the ldos @xmath188 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltade ] ) converges for small distances , i.e. , for @xmath103 , to the pa result . on the other hand , for large distances ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath130 , this correction should be inversely proportional to the correlation length and can be described quantitatively utilizing the lda of the proper self energy in eqs .",

    "it can be seen that the ldos converges to the two limits for small and large distances giving a surface roughness correction on the order of some percent only for distances smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "the arrow indicates that the surface roughness correction decreases when increasing the correlation length @xmath35 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltade1787e11 ] we show a similar plot when choosing the surface phonon frequency @xmath197 and plotting the modulus of @xmath188 . as before",
    ", it can be observed that @xmath188 converges to the pa and the lda for @xmath103 or @xmath130 , resp .",
    "apart from that for distances @xmath198 the surface roughness correction to the ldos @xmath192 becomes negative , a feature not seen for @xmath195 .",
    "this behaviour can be understood from the above given discussion : the dispersion relation of the surface phonons is broadened due to roughness induced scattering yielding a negative @xmath199 for frequencies around the surface phonon frequency and for wavevectors around @xmath78 , because in that region the roughness induced scattering of surface phonons is strong . since for a given distance @xmath89 the main contributions to @xmath192 stem from wavevectors @xmath200 , this roughness induced broadening becomes important for distances @xmath198 giving a smaller ldos than for a flat surface so that @xmath188 is negative . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltade1787e11 ] the correction varies from about @xmath201 percent to about @xmath202 percent in the distance regime @xmath203 for @xmath79 .    now , as can for example be seen for @xmath204 in fig .",
    "[ fig : imrefl ]  ( b ) and for the spectrum of @xmath188 in fig .",
    "[ fig : despecnear ] for frequencies slightly below or above the surface resonance the ldos increases due to the roughness induced scattering of surface phonons .",
    "hence , relatively large positive surface roughness correction can be expected for such frequencies . to illustrate this statement we also plot @xmath188 for @xmath205 in fig .  [",
    "fig : deltade18e13 ] .",
    "it is apparent from the above given examples that the distance dependence of the surface roughness correction to the ldos is not only sensitive to the surface roughness parameters themself , but also to the chosen frequency",
    ". additionally , the surface roughness correction @xmath188 is in general nonmonotonous and especially large for frequencies around the surface phonon resonance .",
    "in this work , we studied the near - field radiative heat transfer between a nanoparticle and a rough surface utilizing direct perturbation theory up to the lowest nonvanishing order in the surface profile . employing the material properties of sic we have shown that the distance dependence of the roughness correction to the heat flux is nonmonotonous and can be qualitatively understood from the roughness correction to the ldos .",
    "we have derived an approximation in the small distance regime , i.e. , for distances @xmath14 much smaller than the correlation length @xmath35 , and have shown that it exactly coincides with the results of the proximity approximation .",
    "hence , the roughness correction is well described by the pa for @xmath206 .",
    "therefrom , one can conclude that the pa might also be helpful in other geometries as used in recent experimental setups  @xcite to estimate the impact of surface roughness to the near - field radiative heat transfer at small distances .",
    "since , the numerical results give larger values for the heat transfer than predicted by the pa for most distances @xmath14 , one can expect to get an estimate of the lower limit of the surface roughness correction when using the pa .    in the large distance limit @xmath71",
    "we have derived a simple approximation for the corresponding expressions of the ldos and the heat flux , which simplifies the numerical calculations in this limit tremendously .",
    "we have shown that in this regime the rough surface can be replaced by an equivalent surface layer of thickness @xmath151 for correlation lengths @xmath35 smaller than the skindepth making contact with the results of refs .",
    "@xcite the corrections to the heat transfer are therefore relatively small in that regime when considering roughness with @xmath207 .    in the intermediate regime",
    "we could show that the ldos and heat flux for a rough material can be smaller than that of a material with a flat surface due to the roughness induced scattering of surface phonon polaritons .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that due to surface roughness the ldos and therefore the heat flux has an s - polarized surface polariton contribution .",
    "the mechanisms behind these two unexpected results has been discussed .",
    "finally , we want to emphasize that the results for the ldos presented in that work have a much larger range of applicability , since the ldos , for instance , also determines the lifetime of atoms and molecules near a surface .",
