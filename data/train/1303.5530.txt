    "the inherent connection between noise and disturbance is one of the most fundamental features of quantum measurements . on the one hand",
    ", a measurement can not give any information without disturbing the object system .",
    "on the other hand , a noisier ( less informative ) measurement can be implemented with less disturbance than a sharper measurement . roughly speaking ,",
    "more noise means that measurement outcome distributions become broader , while disturbance is reflected in the measurement outcome statistics of subsequent measurements . in the most extreme case , the disturbance inherent in a measurement",
    "makes all subsequent measurements useless as far as the original input state is concerned .",
    "various trade - off inequalities between noise ( or information ) and disturbance are known , all depending on different quantification of these notions , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "all these trade - off inequalities are revealing different aspects of the interplay between noise and disturbance in quantum measurements . in this work we present a relation between certain important forms of noise and disturbance which is qualitative in nature and not based on any specific quantifications of noise and disturbance .",
    "our result is a structural connection between observables and channels .",
    "more precisely , we show that a certain partial order in the set of equivalence classes of quantum observables ( positive operator valued measures ) corresponds to an inclusion of the related subsets of quantum channels ( trace preserving completely positive maps ) . as we will explain , this correspondence has a clear interpretation as a noise - disturbance relationship since it shows how the possible state transformations are limited to more noisy ones if the measurement is required to be more accurate . due to its simplicity and generality , we believe that our qualitative noise - disturbance relation can be seen as a common origin of many quantitative noise - disturbance inequalities .    to give a preliminary idea on the coming developments , we recall two well - known special situations .",

    "the output state is a mixture @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are states that depend on the measurement device but not on the input state .",
    "hence , a measurement in an orthonormal basis is sharp but disturbs a lot .",
    "a completely different kind of measurement is such that we do nothing on the input state but we just throw a dice to produce measurement outcome probabilities .",
    "this measurement has maximum amount of noise , but it can be implemented without disturbing the input state at all .",
    "most of measurements belong to the intermediate area between the two previously described extreme cases .",
    "namely , they contain some additional noise and can be measured in a way that implies some disturbance .",
    "more noise should allow for a less disturbing measurement , and vice versa .",

    "the simplest kind of measurements are binary ( i.e. two - outcome ) measurements on a qubit system . for each vector @xmath236 with @xmath237",
    ", we define a binary qubit observable @xmath238 by @xmath239 it is easy to see that @xmath240 if and only if @xmath241 and @xmath242 are parallel vectors and @xmath243 . to demonstrate how this order structure of observables is reflected in the measurement disturbance ,",
    "let us consider the lders measurements for the above type of qubit observables .",
    "the lders instrument related to @xmath238 is defined as @xmath244 the corresponding channel is @xmath245 , where @xmath246 let us note that the unitary channel @xmath247 depends on the direction of @xmath242 but not on its norm , while the weight @xmath248 depends on the norm of @xmath242 but not on its direction . applying theorem [ thm : main ] for two observables @xmath238 and @xmath249 with parallel vectors",
    "@xmath242 and @xmath241 , we conclude that for two parameters @xmath250 $ ] and a unitary channel @xmath247 defined in , there exists a channel @xmath72 such that @xmath251 if and only if @xmath252 .",
    "this is in line what we would expect ; the sharper the measurement , the smaller must the weight of the identity channel be . in this example , it is not too difficult to find the concrete form of a channel @xmath72 satisfying .",

    "classical and quantum post - processings yield physically meaningful preorderings in the sets of observables and channels , respectively . when lifted to the sets of equivalence classes , these relations become partial orderings .",
    "the partial orderings can be seen as abstract and general ways to describe certain important forms of noise and disturbance .",
    "we have proved that the fundamental trade - off between noise and disturbance in quantum measurements takes a very natural form in this framework .",
    "namely , an observable @xmath17 is more noisy than another observable @xmath24 if and only if the set of @xmath17-channels ( the channels that possibly describe the state transformation in some measurement of @xmath17 ) is larger than the set of @xmath24-channels .",
    "if @xmath156 , then the polar decomposition theorem states that a bounded operator @xmath257 can be written as @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is a partial isometry .",

    "we show that in the two cases treated in theorem [ th : ideal ] , partial isometries can be replaced with isometries .",
    "first , we prove that the operator @xmath157 in can be chosen to be an isometry . since @xmath151 satisfies @xmath152 ,",

    "the relationship @xmath119 implies that there exists a partial isometry @xmath285 satisfying @xmath286 and @xmath287=ker[{\\mathsf{a}}(x)]$ ] . since @xmath288 holds , there exists a partial isometry @xmath289 satisfying @xmath290 and @xmath291=ker[{\\mathbf{1}}-{\\mathsf{a}}(x)]$ ] .",
