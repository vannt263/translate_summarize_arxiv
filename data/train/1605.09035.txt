    "the main goal of this note is to give a survey of convergence results for correlation functions in the critical planar ising model obtained during the last several years .",
    "the ising model , which is the simplest lattice model of a ferromagnet , was proposed by lenz in 1920 and is now considered to be an archetypical example of a statistical mechanics system that admits an order - disorder phase transition in dimensions two and above , and for which the appearance of the _ conformal symmetry _ at criticality in dimension two can be rigorously understood in great detail .",
    "certainly , everybody knows that `` 2d ising model is a free fermion '' though this statement may look a bit vague for the probabilistic community .",
    "more precisely , the partition function of the _ nearest - neighbor _ ising model on a planar graph  @xmath0 can be written  @xcite as the pfaffian of some matrix ( e.g. , indexed by oriented edges of  @xmath0 ) .",
    "this fact allows one to introduce so - called _ fermionic observables _ as the pfaffians of ( small - size ) minors of the inverse matrix and give a concrete meaning to the statement mentioned above : if one interprets these observables as formal correlators , the fermionic wick rule for the multi - point ones is built - in .",
    "such observables satisfy simple linear equations which ( at criticality ) can be interpreted as a _ discrete holomorphicity _ property and can be equivalently defined in a purely combinatorial manner  @xcite . moreover , as was proposed by smirnov in his seminal papers  @xcite , they can be thought of as solutions to discrete version of some special riemann - type boundary value problems in order to prove their convergence to conformal covariant limits .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that the fermionic observables per se do not allow one to analyze the _ spin correlations _",
    ", which are presumably the most interesting quantities appearing in the ising model .",
    "an appropriate tool to study them is _ spinor observables _",
    "@xcite , which can be thought of as generalizations of the fermionic ones for the ising model considered on an appropriate double - cover of  @xmath0 and constrained with the spin - flip symmetry between the sheets . a more systematic way to introduce them",
    "is provided by the famous spin - disorder formalism of kadanoff and ceva  @xcite . in this language ,",
    "the fermionic variables are obtained by fusing ( a part of ) spins and disorders , and the relevant pfaffian identities can be deduced from the combinatorial representations of their correlators .",
    "we review the combinatorics of the 2d ising model in section  [ section : combinatorics ] , following  @xcite .",
    "note that one can define the fermionic and spinor observables in the ising model considered on an _ arbitrary _ planar graph , as well as use them for the study of the model away of criticality .",
    "we illustrate our approach to the analysis of spin correlations in section  [ section : explicit - formulae ] .",
    "namely , we give a self - contained derivation of two classical results about the ( critical and subcritical ) diagonal spin - spin correlations in the full - plane using a direct link with the theory of orthogonal polynomials provided by spinor observables ; see  @xcite for similar computations in the half - plane .",
    "section  [ section : conformal - invariance ] follows @xcite and is devoted to the convergence and conformal covariance of the correlation functions at criticality . for simplicity , we consider the ising model on _ square grid _ approximations to a given planar domain  @xmath1 ; in fact , a good portion of results can be directly generalized to isoradial graphs .",
    "we also assume that  @xmath1 is simply connected and consider  `` @xmath2 '' boundary conditions only ; see  @xcite for a general setup .",
    "the presentation is organized so as to highlight the correspondence between discrete objects and the standard conformal field theory language used to describe the continuum limit of the critical ising model . in particular , all the normalizing factors in discrete are adjusted so as to fit the ones in continuum .",
    "it should be said that there are plenty of important topics on the 2d ising model that we do not touch in this note .",
    "there are more involved methods to study spin correlations in the infinite - volume limit , notably a link with painlev equations developed in  @xcite , quadratic identities found in  @xcite and the exact bosonization approach suggested in  @xcite ; see also the monographs  @xcite and  @xcite . at criticality",
    ", one might be interested in convergence results for lattice counterparts of other cft fields ( e.g. , the stress - energy tensor  @xcite ) and in a definition of the virasoro algebra action on these lattice fields  @xcite .",
    "also , we do not touch the conformal invariance of curves  @xcite and loop ensembles  @xcite arising in the critical model .",
    "finally , an important progress has been achieved recently  @xcite in the analysis of the finite - range 2d ising model via rigorous renormalization techniques .",
