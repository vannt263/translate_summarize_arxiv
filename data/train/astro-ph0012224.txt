    "time - resolved observations are an important method for investigating astrophysical phenomena .",
    "this is particularly the case for objects which can not be resolved spatially , as then the amount of information available is greatly limited .",
    "temporal monitoring is central to many parts of astrophysics , such as pulsars , the physics of stars in the instability strip , microlensing and gamma ray bursts .",
    "however , monitoring is important even for apparently `` stable '' objects , e.g.for the determination of stellar rotation periods , and has led to the discovery of transient activity in a whole range of astrophysical objects .",
    "variability is a phenomenon which is potentially important in ultra cool dwarfs , because at these low temperatures ( and masses ) these objects are fully convective , and many molecules and condensates form in their atmospheres .",
    "furthermore , many may also be rapid rotators , providing a possible driving mechanism for atmospheric dynamics .",
    "they could , therefore , show a range of time - dependent observable phenomena , such as the rotational modulation of the light curve due to surface inhomogeneities , the evolution of magnetically - induced star spots , accretion activity ( for the youngest objects ) , flaring , movement of photospheric clouds , and eclipses by unseen companions or disks .",
    "ultra cool dwarfs can be divided into the three spectral types t , l and late m. the l dwarfs are the low temperature continuation of the m dwarf sequence . as the temperature drops , the strong tio and vo bands which characterises the optical and infrared spectra of m dwarfs are replaced by very broad neutral alkali lines and lines of iron hydrides .",
    "modelling of low resolution optical and near infrared spectra implies a temperature range of 2000k down to 1300k ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "however , a temperature assignment using fits to high resolution profiles of the alkali lines indicates a somewhat hotter range of 22001600k ( basri et al.@xcite ) . at even lower temperatures methane can form , and broad absorption features of this  as well as water  in the infrared",
    "are the distinguishing features of t dwarfs .",
    "ultra cool dwarfs cover a range of masses ( the mass for a given effective temperature depending on the age ) from a few jupiter masses up to a few tenths of a solar mass ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "for example , an l dwarf could in principle , be a hydrogen burning star , a brown dwarf or even a giant gas planet if it is young enough .",
    "objects later than l4.5 are expected to be substellar ( kirkpatrick et al.@xcite ) .    to date , little variability monitoring of ultra cool dwarfs has been reported .",
    "tinney & tolley ( @xcite ) found variability ( at a 98% confidence level ) with an amplitude of 0.04 magnitudes over a few hours in an m9 brown dwarf , but detected no variability above 0.1 magnitudes in an l5 dwarf .",
    "terndrup et al .",
    "( @xcite ) searched for rotational modulation of the light curves of eight m type stars and brown dwarfs in the pleiades .",
    "they derived periodicities for two low mass stars , but found no significant variability in the rest of the sample . at the lower end of the temperature scale , nakajima et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found variability in the near infrared spectrum of a t dwarf over a period of 80 minutes . in an earlier paper",
    "we reported the first results from a program to monitor a number of brown dwarfs and l dwarfs ( bailer - jones & mundt  @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "of the six objects monitored , we discovered evidence for variability in the field l1 dwarf 2m1145 , and tentatively assigned a period . in the present paper",
    "we have extended this work to a total of 21 m and l dwarfs , and look for evidence of any variability in the i band down to a precision of 0.005 magniutdes on timescales between a fraction of an hour and several days .    in the next section",
    "we describe the selection of the target objects and their relevant properties .",
    "section  [ data ] describes the observational and data reduction strategy , with a discussion of the steps required to achieve high precision relative photometry on these faint objects , as well as an accurate estimate of the photometric errors .",
    "we then discuss the construction and analysis of the differential light curves to look for evidence of variability .",
    "section  [ timeseries ] describes our time series analysis techniques .",
    "the results section summaries our findings , with a description for individual objects .",
    "the main argument of this paper is presented in section  [ discussion ] , where we then discuss the interpretation of our results in terms of physical phenomena .",
    "the data presented in paper i have been re - reduced and re - analysed in the present paper .",
    "although the results are generally consistent , the results in the present paper supersede those in paper i.",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the results of the application of the @xmath3 test to the 21 targets are shown in table  [ detections ] for the detections ( @xmath4 ) and table  [ nondetections ] for the non - detections ( @xmath5 ) of variability . in these tables",
    "we use two measures of the variability amplitude .",
    "the first , @xmath6 , is simply the rms ( root - mean - square ) value of @xmath7 for the whole light curve ( all @xmath8 ) .",
    "this measure disproportionately represents large values , so we also quote @xmath9 , the mean of the absolute values of @xmath7 . assigning an amplitude in this low snr regime is non - trivial .",
    "for example , using a slightly different aperture size can give a slightly different amplitude , because the noise changes .",
    "as the same aperture has been used for all objects ( except sdss  0539 ) these amplitudes are at least comparable . in general",
    "one needs to determine the amplitude by solving for a parametrized model , e.g.  by marginalising over nuisance parameters in an appropriate bayesian framework .",
    "we are not prepared to assign such a model at this time , so we simply report these measures .    for those objects in which we did not detect variability ,",
    "we have set upper limits on the amplitude according to what we could have detected .",
    "this was done by creating a set of synthetic light curves by multiplying each @xmath7 by @xmath10 , for increasing ( small ) values of @xmath11 .",
    "the amplitude limits were obtained from that synthetic light curve which gave @xmath12 according to the @xmath3 test .",
    "( the @xmath13 value quoted in table  [ nondetections ] is that from the actual data . )",
    "the reliability of the @xmath3 test clearly depends on an accurate determination of the magnitude errors in the target .",
    "we have checked this by analysing the relative magnitude variations , @xmath9 , in reference stars of similar brightness as the target ( both before and after rejection of any variables ) .",
    "we found that these variations are similar to ( and , in particular , no larger than ) the mean error , @xmath14 , for the respective target , indicating that we are not underestimating the errors , and hence not overestimating @xmath3 or the significance of a detection .",
    "we point out that the significance of a detection can not be judged simply by looking at the ratio of @xmath6 to @xmath15 .",
    "this ratio is not the `` sigma detection '' level , because the light curve consists of many points : in the case of a very large number of epochs , statistically significant fluctuations could be recognised even if @xmath6 were hardly more than @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution takes this into account via the degrees of freedom .",
    "some of the detections / non - detections in the tables are close to the significance limit , for which a value of @xmath12 was chosen as being reasonably conservative .",
    "the choice is , however , somewhat arbitrary , and we could have chosen 0.05 or 0.001 , which would make some detections into non - detections , or vice versa .",
    "we mention this to emphasise that detections / non - detections close to the limit should be treated with due uncertainty .",
    "three of the detections in table  [ detections ] ( 2m0913 , 2m1146 and calar 3 ) were non - detections in paper i. these new detections have amplitudes below the limits placed on them in paper i. roque 11 and teide 1 ( non - detections in paper i ) remain non - detections , but now at lower amplitude limits .",
    "the increased sensitivity in the present paper come about for a number of reasons : improved flat fielding , including an illumination correction ; better fringe removal , including a lower noise fringe correction image ; use of more reference stars ; a slightly smaller photometry aperture to improve the snr .    in analysing the light curves",
    ", it came to our attention that four of the five targets from 99 - 09 seem to have a lower average flux on the last ( fourth ) night than the average of the preceding three nights ( by 0.01 to 0.03 magnitudes ; the fifth target , roque 12 , was not observed on this night ) .",
    "this effect is not seen , however , in any of the reference stars , not even ones of similar brightness to the targets . after eliminating other potential problems with the observing and reduction , one possible cause is that the effective bandpass was different on this night .",
    "as the reference stars are presumably much bluer on average than the targets , this could change the magnitude of the targets relative to the reference stars without changing the magnitudes of the reference stars relative to one another .",
    "the beginning of the fourth night was lost to cloud and humidity , and residual cloud cover could have remained for the rest of the night .",
    "however , it appears that a thin cloud layer does not significantly alter the wavelength dependence of the atmospheric extinction coefficient over the i band ( driscoll  @xcite ) , so we can not provide a satisfactory explanation of this observation at this time .",
    "although it is possible that the effect is intrinsic to all four objects , it is rather suspicious , so we exclude this night from our analysis and the results presented in the tables .",
    "if this night were included , 2m0030 and roque 16 would become detections .",
    "no such correlated behaviour is seen in the targets from the other runs .",
    "broad band differential photometry can be affected by second - order colour dependent extinction , even in clear conditions , but due to the very small airmass gradient across the field - of - view , this contribution is estimated to be well below the 0.5% error ( see young  @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "notes are now given on all the objects with statistically significant @xmath3 detections , along with brief comments at the end of the section on the non - detections .",
    "the implications of these results will be discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "2m0345_. the light curve shows no interesting features and there are no peaks in the cleaned power spectrum above four times the noise . if the dubious fourth night is included this becomes a very significant detection ( @xmath161e-9 ) .",
    "2m0913_. this detection is due primarily to a significant drop in the flux around ajd 1187.5 ( fig .",
    "[ 2m0913_lc ] ) , going down to 0.13 magnitudes below the median for that night , and can be seen when a range of aperture sizes are used for the photometry .",
    "although there was some cloud and moon around this time , no similar drop is seen in the reference stars , including two of similar brightness to 2m0913 .",
    "furthermore , two other targets taken at this time ( 2m1145 and 2m1146 ) do not show this behaviour .",
    "there is no evidence for variability within the other three nights .",
    "there are no strong periodicities in the cleaned power spectrum , the strongest three being at 3.36 , 0.76 and 0.64 ( @xmath17 ) hours , each at around only five times the noise level .",
    "+    _ 2m1145_. evidence for variability in this l dwarf was presented in paper i , and it was tentatively claimed to be periodic with a period of 7.1 hours ( using the lomb ",
    "scargle periodogram ) , pending confirmation .",
    "the cleaned power spectrum of these same data ( old reduction ) gives peaks at @xmath18 and @xmath19 hours .",
    "the new reduction of these data still gives evidence for variability , but the cleaned power spectrum shows peaks ( all at about eight times the noise ) at @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath19 hours ( fig .  [ 2m1145_9901_ps ] ) .",
    "the improved reduction in the present paper has reduced the average photometric error from 0.027 to 0.022 magnitudes .",
    "( three additional frames in the new reduction two nights earlier are also used , which improves the resolution of the power spectrum . )",
    "the light curves from the two reductions are consistent within their combined errors .",
    "a small peak is still seen around 7.1 hours in the new reduction , but it has far less power . in the dirty spectrum ,",
    "this peak is one of the strongest , indicating that it has probably been artificially enhanced by the window function : this demonstrates the necessity of cleaning the power spectrum .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ 2m1145_9901_ps ] how difficult it would be to confidently locate the dominant peaks in the dirty spectrum .",
    "we are confident of the superiority of the new reduction , so while the variability detection in 2m1145 in paper i still holds , the tentatively assigned period of 7.1 hours does not .",
    "2m1145 was re - observed at higher snr and with more epochs across four nights in the 00 - 02 run .",
    "these data ( fig .",
    "[ 2m1145_0002_lc ] ) also show very strong evidence for variability , and the power spectrum shows four significant peaks at the following periods ( with power in units of the noise in parentheses ) : @xmath23 ( 31 ) , @xmath24 ( 14 ) , @xmath25 ( 7 ) , @xmath26 ( 14 ) hours ( fig .",
    "[ 2m1145_0002_ps ] ) .",
    "note that the first period is four times the third , so these may not be independent .",
    "there are essentially no common peaks in this power spectrum and the one from 99 - 01 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , most epochs in the 00 - 02 run were taken in pairs with no time gap between them .",
    "this enables us to produce a binned light curve consisting of 33 points ( four single points removed ) .",
    "the cleaned power spectrum of this only has a significant periodicity at @xmath27 hours ( 8 times the noise ) .",
    "there is still a periodicity at @xmath28 hours , but now at only five times the noise level .",
    "it is unlikely that either is the rotation period , as neither was detected in the 99 - 01 data ( fig .",
    "[ 2m1145_9901_ps ] ) .",
    "we can be confident that 2m1145 does not have both _",
    "( over a one year timescale ) surface features and a rotation period of between 1 and 70 hours .",
    "if it did , we would have detected such a rotation period in both runs ( see section  [ simulations ] ) .",

    "the second and third are in the ratio 3:1 , so are probably not independent .",
    "the one at three hours is more convincing based on the phase coverage in the phased light curve .",

    "an object of radius @xmath34 ( expected for these objects , see chabrier & baraffe @xcite ) , this implies a rotation period of @xmath35 hours , or less , due to the unknown inclination , @xmath36 , of the rotation axis to the line of sight . in the case of 2m1146 , however , there is another complicating factor , namely that koerner et al.(@xcite ) have observed it to be a brightness ratio one binary , with separation 0.3@xmath37 ( 7.6 au ) ) , so does not complicate the @xmath32 determination of basri et al . ] .",
    "this was not resolved by our observations , so our light curve ( and power spectrum ) is a composite of the two objects .",

    "there is a bright ( @xmath48 ) star nearby ( 5@xmath37 ) which may well interfere with this variability determination .",
    "for example , small changes in this star s brightness could result in large changes in the apparent brightness of s  ori  45 due to the flux gradient across the sky and photometry apertures of s  ori  45 .",
    "the most significant peak in the power spectrum is at @xmath49 hours ( at 20 times the noise ) , which would be extremely fast if it is the rotation period .",
    "clearly , much more rapid monitoring is required to determine this .",
    "there is a dip in three points around ajd 1606.9 , similar to that seen in sdss  1203 , but we are hesitant to draw conclusions given the proximity of the bright star . s  ori  44 was observed in the same frame as s  ori  45 , and if we plot the light curve of one relative to the other , we see that @xmath50 varies between @xmath510.15 and @xmath52 mag with a mean of @xmath53 and a standard error in this mean of @xmath54 mag .",

    "the remaining objects do not show dominant periods , although the two earliest - type variables ( s  ori  31 and s  ori  33 ) show near - sinusoidal light curves at detected periods .",
    "the light curve of one object , sdss  1203 , is essentially featureless except for a dip which may be due to an eclipse by a companion , although there is no direct evidence for this .",
    "all of the objects which show variability have rms amplitudes ( @xmath6 in table  [ detections ] ) between 0.01 and 0.055 magnitudes ( ignoring s  ori  45 ) .",
    "the lower limit is set by the sensitivity of the observations , but no such upper limit is set .",
    "thus one conclusion from this work is that these objects generally only have small amplitude variations , most in the range 0.01 to 0.03 magnitudes , on timescales of typically a few to a few tens of hours .",
    "the large fraction of non - detections ( 50% ) , with upper limits on their rms amplitudes as low as 0.01 magnitudes , indicates that at least some ultra cool dwarfs have variability amplitudes less than 0.01 magnitudes .",
    "these detections / non - detections are claimed on the basis of a @xmath3 test of the light curves .",
    "this requires a careful estimation of the photometric errors for the target objects : we confirmed that these were not underestimated via a comparison with the variability level of stars in the field of similar brightness .",
    "additionally , the use of many reference stars ( from which variables were first eliminated ) plus the conservative assignment of a flat - fielding and fringe - removal error , gives us good confidence that we have not overestimated the significance of detections .",
    "we highlight that the 99% confidence level for the detection of variability is a somewhat arbitrary one : the division between tables  [ detections ] and  [ nondetections ] represents a confidence level and not a definitive statement of what is and what is not variable at a certain amplitude .",
    "the power spectrum is a representation of the light curve in the frequency domain ( equation  [ powerdef ] ) : @xmath58 is the contribution of a sinusoid at frequency @xmath59 to the variance in the light curve @xmath60 .",
    "the goal of this analysis is to see whether the light curve can be more simply explained in this domain .",
    "however , the presence of a significant peak in the power spectrum does not mean that this is a long - term periodicity .",
    "after all , _ any _ light curve , including a random one , can be described in terms of its power spectrum , so the features in the light curve must appear somewhere in the power spectrum .",
    "the question is whether this description tells us anything useful about the source .",
    "if we detect just one or two dominant peaks then it may well be appropriate to describe the light curve as periodic at the detected period(s ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , we detect a large number of peaks , then , given that we have a finite number of data points , these peaks are less likely to correspond to true long - term periodicities .",
    "the ideal case of a pure sinusoidal light curve is only produced by a rotating star if one hemisphere is uniformly darker than the other and the star is observed along its equatorial plane .",
    "a star with a single small surface feature ( `` spot '' ) would show a sinusoidal pattern ( due to a cosine projection effect ) only when the spot is on the observable hemisphere ; for up to half of the rotation ( depending on the inclination of the rotation axis ) the light curve would be constant .",
    "a star with two spots would show a yet more complex light curve , as two , one or no spots are observable at any one time . while these light curves will be periodic , they will not be sinusoidal , as additional sine waves are required to reconstruct the exact shape of the light curve .",
    "hence the power spectrum of the light curve of a rotating star will typically consist of several peaks , any number of which may be significant . of course , certain spot patterns may give rise to near - sinusoidal variations , but not necessarily so .",
    "for example , several of the light curves of herbst et al.(@xcite ) are periodic but not due to a single sinusoidal component .",
    "we have simulated the appearance of the light curves in a few such situations .",
    "fig  [ simul01_rot ] shows the light curve due to a single small dark spot on a star which causes a maximum 0.05 magnitude decrease in brightness .",
    "if we rotate this star with a period of five hours and observe it with the same noise level and time sampling as one of our target objects ( 2m1334 ) we obtain the power spectrum and phased light curve in fig .  [ simul01_ps ] and fig .",
    "[ simul01_rot]c respectively .",
    "we see that the power spectrum picks out the rotation period despite the noise and despite the fact that the light curve is not sinusoidal .",
    "furthermore , the phased light curve certainly does not resemble a sine wave , yet this _ is _ the rotation period .",
    "another example is shown in fig .",
    "[ simul05_rot ] where we now have five small dark spots with random longitudes ( i.e.phases ) causing dimmings of 0.011 , 0.015 , 0.028 , 0.030 and 0.034 magnitudes .",
    "again the star is rotated with a period of five hours and observed as 2m1334 was .",

    "[ simul07_ps ] ) .",
    "we have carried out many tens of simulations of stars with between one and ten spots with contrasts between @xmath63 and @xmath64 magnitudes and having random phases , and sampled them using the samping functions of several objects in this paper .",
    "we found that provided the light curve showed significant variation ( according to our @xmath3 criterion ) then the rotation period was always significant ( @xmath6510 times the noise level ) , and in all but one case was the largest peak .      in the light of these simulations",
    ", we see that the absence of _ sinusoidal _ variation in the light curve phased to a certain period does not rule that out as the rotation period .",
    "thus the phased light curve is not a robust means of identifying rotation periods .",
    "moreover , the absence of any significant peaks seems to imply one of two things : either the object is not rotating at a period to which we are sensitive , or the surface features themselves are not stable over the timescale of observations . a third possibility  that the contrast of the spots is too low ",
    "is ruled out because we have already made a significant detection of variability according to the @xmath3 test .",
    "if the duration of observations is less than a rotation period , the light curve will show features rotating on and off the limb of the ( unresolved ) projected disk : these changes must be represented somehow in the power spectrum , even though they are not due to long - term periodicities of the source .",
    "if the surface features are not stable , then the light curve may be even more complex due to the evolution of individual features . in both cases , we may not expect to see any dominant periodicities .",
    "our maximum time span of observations , , is between 30 and 120 hours , so for us to have observed less than a rotation period , all of our objects would have to have maximum @xmath32 values of between 1 and 4  ( assuming a radius of @xmath34 ) .",
    "however , this is inconsistent with the results of basri et al .  ( @xcite ) , who report much higher @xmath32 values ( 1060 ) for all but one of a sample of 17 late m and l dwarfs in the field which were not selected with any known bias for rapid rotation .",
    "( chabrier & baraffe @xcite ) . ]",
    "thus our objects probably have rotation periods of order 1 to 10 hours , to which we were certainly sensitive .",
    "thus the fact that we have several objects which show no dominant periodicities is significant , as it appears not to be explainable by rotational modulation of stable spots . _",
    "the logical conclusion from the above arguments is that some of our objects have surface features which evolve over the duration of our observations .",
    "_ this applies in particular to 2m0345 , 2m0913 , 2m1145 and calar  3 . for 2m1145",
    "we possibly have more direct evidence of this , as the two light curves from one year apart show no common periods , despite the fact that simulations demonstrate we would have detected any likely period due to stable spots in _ both _ runs .",
    "we can imagine that if the features are themselves changing in brightness then these could dominate the power spectrum and mask the rotation period .",
    "the rotation period could possibly then be determined through more measurements over many rotation periods , as the noise level in the power spectrum would then decrease , whereas the power in the rotation period would stay constant .      variability in stable stars is often attributed to rotational modulation of star spots produced by magnetic activity . in solar - type stars",
    "it is believed to be due to the so - called @xmath66 dynamo .",
    "this mechanism no longer operates in low mass stars and brown dwarfs , but as these objects are fully convective , a turbulent dynamo could come into operation ( see chabrier & baraffe @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "m stars often show significant chromospheric activity , as measured by @xmath67 .",
    "recent work suggests that this value drops from around @xmath68 for m7 down to below @xmath69 for l1 and later - type objects ( gizis et al .",
    "basri  ( @xcite ) observes a similar decline and kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( @xcite ) detected no h@xmath70 emission ( ew @xmath71 ) for types later than l4.5 .",
    "this suggests that magnetically - induced surface features may be present on the surfaces of some of the objects in our sample , but that the contrast of the spots may decline beyond m7 .",
    "this is interesting when we compare it with the relationship between the amplitude of variability and spectral type , shown in fig .",
    "we see that a larger fraction of the objects beyond m9 show variability : 7 of 10 equal to or later than m9 , compared to 2 of 9 earlier than m9 ( ignoring the ambiguous detection / non - detection in s  ori  45 ) .",
    "this is not simply due a higher detection limit for the earlier type objects , as these have an average amplitude / detection limit ( @xmath6 ) of 0.025 mag , compared to 0.023 mag for the later type objects .",
    "if the variability were due to magnetic spots , we might expect variability to be _ less _ common among the less active later - type objects , not _",
    "more _ common as seen here .",
    "this trend may be an age effect , as all of our objects of type m9 and earlier are cluster members with ages less than 120myr .",
    "we see no significant relationships between variability amplitude ( or limit ) and h@xmath70 equivalent width .",
    "another candidate for producing variability is photospheric dust clouds .",
    "it is now well established from detailed modelling of optical and infrared spectra that late m and l dwarfs have sufficiently cool atmospheres for solid particles to form ( e.g.  jones & tsuji @xcite , burrows & sharp @xcite , lodders @xcite , chabrier et al .",
    "@xcite ) . whether this dust stays in suspension in the atmosphere or gravitationally settles on a short timescale is still an open question .",
    "basri et al.(@xcite ) conclude that there must be relatively little dust opacity on account of the very strong alkali lines in the optical spectra of l dwarfs . however , this leaves open the possibility that dust is present deeper in the photosphere where it would affect the infrared spectrum .",
    "models which include dust opacity give better fits to the near infrared spectra of late m and early l dwarfs than those which do not ( chabrier et al .",
    "( however , none of the present models predict accurate near infrared colours for late l dwarfs , so it appears that the distribution of dust in the atmospheres of ultra cool dwarfs is more complex than currently appreciated . )",
    "dust may coalesce into large - scale opaque ( dark ) clouds , and the evolution ( formation , growth and dissipation ) of such clouds over a few rotation periods could account for our observed variability .",
    "these would have to be relatively large clouds , because many small clouds evolving independently would have an insignificant net effect on the light curve .",
    "we have seen that ultra cool dwarfs are rapid rotators , and this ( as well as possibly differential rotation ) is a likely driving mechanism for cloud evolution .",
    "these objects are fully convective , so we can imagine a situation in which dust particles are convectively cycled up and down in the photosphere",
    ". dynamical processes such as turbulent diffusion may well be important for modelling dust and its formation into clouds , yet such processes are not taken into account in current atmospheric models .",
    "comparison with weather patterns seen in solar - system atmospheres must be done with caution , however , as solar - system planets are significantly cooler .",
    "this dust cloud explanation appears to be supported by our observation that variability is more common in later - type ( cooler ) objects , i.e.  those in which more dust can form .",
    "other options for the variability can be entertained , such as flaring or outbursts , possibly associated with magnetic activity .",
    "flaring is not uncommon in these late - type objects .",
    "the very young objects in @xmath0  orionis may still have circumstellar disks from which they are accreting matter , and variability of the infall ( or even eclipsing by the disk ) could account for some variability .",
    "there is , however , no evidence for disks from the infrared observations ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "another possible explanation is that the variability is due to hotspots from infalling material in an interacting binary , but this is unlikely to be the explanation in all cases .    given the relatively small amounts of data on any one object , it is difficult to say much about the characteristics of the variability .",
    "however , some of the power spectra are not much different from random data .",
    "if we simulate random light curves from a measured light curve by reassigning flux measurements to epochs , we find that the cleaned power spectra often have peaks more than several times the noise .",
    "while some peaks reported in section  [ results ] could well be due to noise , not all peaks can be due to noise when we have a significant @xmath3 detections .",
    "there are several random processes intrinsic to the star which could produce the observed light curves , such as the independent evolution of many surface features .",
    "chaotic processes can also give the appearance of a random process when observed in certain parameter spaces .",
    "we have presented light curves for 21 late m and l dwarfs to probe variability on timescales between a fraction of an hour to over 100 hours .",
    "11 objects showed evidence for variability at the 99% confidence level according to a @xmath3 test , with amplitudes between 0.009 and 0.055 magnitudes ( rms ) .",
    "of these objects , four ( 2m1145 , 2m1334 , sdss  0539 , s  ori  31 ) showed strong evidence for variability ( confidence greater than 99.99% ) .",
    "it has been shown how a careful data reduction and analysis of the errors ensures the reliability of this test .",
    "the ten non - detections have upper limits on their rms amplitudes of between 0.009 and 0.043 magnitudes .",
    "a power spectral analysis was performed on all variable objects using the clean algorithm . in a few cases ( 2m1146 , 2m1334 , sdss  0539 ,",
    "s  ori  31 ) there were significant periodicities ( at @xmath21 , @xmath38 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 hours respectively ) which dominated the power spectra . for 2m1334 , sdss  0529 and s  ori  31 these may be the rotation periods .",
    "we demonstrated with simulations that the rotation period does not necessarily produce _ sinusoidal _ variation in the light curve : thus these periods can only be confirmed or refuted with longer - term monitoring with more complete coverage .",
    "the 5.1 hour period for 2m1146 was shown not to be the rotation period on the basis of an inconsistency with the @xmath32 measurement of basri et al .",
    "the remaining seven significantly variable light curves did not show dominant periods , and in at least three cases ( 2m0345 , 2m0913 , calar  3 ) there are not even any significant periods .",
    "our simulations showed that we would have detected any plausible rotation periods for these objects based on @xmath32 measurements .",
    "we therefore concluded that the lack of significant periods was due to the evolution of the features on timescales shorter than our observation span , and that these `` wash out '' the rotation period in the power spectrum .",
    "2m1145 showed no common periodicities in two separate significantly variable light curves obtained on year apart , thus supporting this view .",
    "we found that variability is more common in objects later than m9 : 7 of 9 objects later than m9 are variable , compared to only 2 of 9 earlier .",
    "this may be related to the observation of gizis et al .",
    "that chromospheric activity declines significantly from m7 to l1 , and perhaps points to the variability in the late - type objects having a non - magnetic origin ; photospheric dust clouds were highlighted as a likely cause .",
    "gaining more insight into the nature of the variability observed in this paper will be the next challenge .",
