    "compton scattering , @xmath0 , and related photoabsorption reaction , have been a subject of intensive theoretical and experimental investigation  @xcite . while in the case of deeply - virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , where the initial photon is highly - virtual",
    ", the qcd factorization is proven @xcite and the amplitude can be expressed in terms of the generalized parton distributions ( gpd ) @xcite , in the case of real compton scattering ( rcs ) the available theoretical tools are rather undeveloped .    on the one hand , as it has been shown in  @xcite , for large momentum transfer @xmath1 it is possible to factorize the rcs amplitude  @xcite and express it in terms of the distribution amplitudes of the proton . on the other hand , it is possible to express the amplitude of the process via the minus 1st - moment of gpds at zero skewedness @xcite .",
    "the traditional sources of quasi - real and virtual photons , the electron beams , with very high collisions energies are expected to be available in near future .",
    "the new projects of lhec  @xcite and eic  @xcite are currently under intensive discussion . besides the electron beams , one can  also use beams of charged hadrons . provided that the transverse overlap of the colliding hadrons is small",
    ", i.e. the transverse distance @xmath2 between the colliding centers is larger than the sizes of the colliding particles , @xmath3 , the electromagnetic interaction between colliding particles becomes the dominant mechanism .",
    "such processes called ultra - peripheral collisions ( upc ) can be studied in @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 collisions . in particular",
    ", one can access rcs in the reaction @xmath7 the typical virtualities @xmath8 of the intermediate photon @xmath9 are controlled by the formfactors of the colliding particles , and are small : @xmath10 thus , @xmath8 is of the order of the soft hadronic scale , so the intermediate photon can be treated as a free weizscker - williams one , i.e. the amplitude of the process  ( [ eq : pp2ppgamma ] ) can be described in terms of rcs .",
    "these processes at the lhc will allow to study rcs at very high energies .",
    "the possibility of observation of such processes experimentally has been demonstrated by the star @xcite and phenix  @xcite experiments at rhic .",
    "it is expected that at lhc photon - proton collisions at energies up to @xmath11  gev can be observed  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on rcs on a proton target .",
    "nuclear effects will be discussed elsewhere .    in what follows",
    "we employ the color dipole approach introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the central objects of the model are the dipole scattering amplitude ,  @xmath12 and the light - cone quark distribution functions of the photon . while pqcd predicts the dipole amplitude only for small - size dipoles , several successful phenomenological parameterizations for the large - size dipoles are known .",
    "relying on the photon wave function evaluated in the instanton vacuum model  @xcite , which is valid for any @xmath13 , one can extend the applicability of the model to the case of the processes with real photons  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are going to consider the real photoabsorption , @xmath14 , and the rcs .",
    "the color dipole model is valid only at sufficiently high energies , where the dominant contribution to the compton amplitude comes from gluonic exchanges .",
    "then the general expression for the compton amplitude in the color dipole model has the form ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the photon polarization vector ; @xmath17 are the light - cone fractional momenta of the quark and antiquark , @xmath18 are the transverse distances in the final and initial dipoles respectively ; * * @xmath19 is the momentum transfer in the compton scattering * * , * * @xmath20 is the scattering amplitude for the dipole state which also implicitly depends on @xmath21 , c.m .",
    "energy squared , and @xmath22 is the wavefunction of the photon in the polarization state @xmath23 @xcite .    at high energies in the small angle approximation , @xmath24 , the quark separation and fractional momenta",
    "are preserved , so , @xmath25 generally , the amplitude @xmath26 is a nonperturbative object , with asymptotic behavior for small  @xmath27 controlled by pqcd @xcite:@xmath28 up to slowly varying corrections @xmath29 .",
    "calculation of the rcs differential cross section also involves the real part of scattering amplitude , whose relation to the imaginary part is quite straightforward . according to @xcite , if the limit @xmath30 exists and is finite , then the real part and imaginary parts of the forward amplitude are related as@xmath31\\frac{\\mathcal{i}m\\,{f(\\delta=0)}}{s^{\\alpha}}.\\label{eq : bronzanful}\\ ] ] in the model under consideration",
    "the imaginary part of the forward dipole amplitude indeed has a power dependence on energy , @xmath32 , so ( [ eq : bronzanful ] ) simplifies to @xmath33    this fixes the phase of the forward compton amplitude , which we retain for nonzero momentum transfers assuming for the real and imaginary parts similar dependences on .",
    "finally we arrive at , @xmath34    for the cross - section of unpolarized compton scattering , from  ( [ eq : dvcs - im - conv ] ) we obtain , @xmath35    the imaginary part of the forward amplitude  ( [ eq : dvcs - im - conv ] ) gives the total photoabsorption cross - section , @xmath36    formulas  ( [ eq : dvcs - cross - section],[eq : photo - tot ] ) are used further for numerical calculations .",
    "in this section we present briefly some details of the wavefunction evaluation in the instanton vacuum model  ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the central object of the model is the partition function of the light quarks , which has the form @xmath37=\\int d\\lambda\\mathcal{d}\\bar\\psi\\mathcal{d}\\psi\\mathcal{d}\\phi e^{is[\\lambda , v,\\bar\\psi,\\psi,\\phi]},\\ ] ] where the effective action @xmath38 $ ] is defined as  @xcite @xmath39=\\int d^{4}x\\left(\\frac{n}{v}\\ln\\lambda+2\\phi^{2}(x)-\\bar{\\psi}\\left(\\hat{p}+\\hat{v}-m - c\\bar{l}f\\otimes\\phi\\cdot\\gamma_{m}\\otimes fl\\right)\\psi\\right).\\ ] ] here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the fields of constituent quarks and mesons respectively , @xmath42 is the density of the instanton gas , @xmath43 is the external vector current corresponding to the photon , @xmath44 is the gauge factor , @xmath45 which provides the gauge covariance of the action , and the nonlinear term in explicit form is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is one of the matrices , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the fourier transform of the zero - mode profile .    in the leading order in @xmath51",
    ", we have the same feynman rules as in the perturbative theory , but with momentum - dependent quark mass @xmath52 in the quark propagator@xmath53 the mass of the constituent quark has a form @xmath54 where @xmath55  mev is the current quark mass , @xmath56  mev is the dynamical mass generated by the interaction with the instanton vacuum background . due to the presence of instantons the coupling of a vector current to a quark is also modified,@xmath57 where @xmath58 is the momentum of the incoming quark , and @xmath59 is the momentum of the photon .",
    "notice that for an arbitrary photon momentum @xmath59 the expression for @xmath60 depends on the choice of the path in  ( [ eq : l - factor ] ) and as a result one can find in the literature different expressions used for evaluations  @xcite . in the limit",
    "@xmath61 the function @xmath50 falls off as @xmath62 so for large @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the mean instanton size , the mass of the quark @xmath65 and vector current interaction vertex @xmath66 .",
    "however we would like to emphasize that the wavefunction @xmath67 gets contribution from both the soft and the hard parts , so even in the large-@xmath68 limit the instanton vacuum function is different from the well - known perturbative result .",
    "we have to evaluate the wavefunctions associated with the following matrix elements :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is one of the matrices @xmath71 in the leading order in @xmath51 one can easily obtain@xmath72 the evaluation of  ( [ eq : wf - lo ] ) is quite tedious but straightforward .",
    "details of this evaluation may be found in  @xcite .",
    "the overlap of the initial and final photon wavefunctions in  ( [ eq : dvcs - cross - section ] ) was evaluated according to@xmath73 where summation is done over possible polarization states @xmath74 . in the final state",
    "we should use @xmath75 , which is related to the reference frame with @xmath76 in which the components  ( [ eq : wf - lo ] ) were evaluated .",
    "the bjorken variable used in dis , @xmath77 , is not appropriate at small photon virtualities , since it does not have the meaning of a fractional quark momentum any more , and may be very small even at low energies . in particular , for rcs the bjorken variable @xmath78 defined in this way would be zero .",
    "therefore , one should rely on the phenomenological dipole cross section which depends on energy , rather than @xmath78 .",
    "we use the @xmath21-dependent dipole cross section proposed in @xcite , which saturates at large separations in analogy to the @xmath78-dependent one proposed in @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , for the elastic dipole amplitude we employ the model developed in @xcite , @xmath79\\times\\nonumber \\\\   & \\times & \\left(e^{-i\\beta\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\delta}}+e^{i(1-\\beta)\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\delta}}-2e^{i\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\beta\\right)\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\delta}}e^{-\\frac{r^{2}}{r_{0}^{2}(s)}}\\right),\\label{eq : im_f - result}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 are the phenomenological parameters known from dis and @xmath81 scattering data .",
    "we employ the @xmath21-dependent parametrization of the dipole cross section suitable for soft processes @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 for the pion cross section we use the parametrization and fit of  @xcite , namely its pomeron part , @xmath84 the parameter @xmath85 in eq .",

    "this parametrization may be used in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dvcs - cross - section]-[eq : photo - tot ] ) only at very high energies where in terms of the regge theory , the pomeron term in the cross section dominates .",
    "so far only two data points shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaxsection ] are available for @xmath95 from the h1 and zeus experiments @xcite , and our parameter free calculation agrees well with these data .    in order to extend the model down to smaller values of @xmath96 , where more data are available",
    ", we added the reggeon contribution , which was fitted to the photoabsorption data in @xcite @xmath97    besides , the pomeron part of the dipole cross section parametrized as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dipole-1]-[eq : r0_standard ] ) exposes some problems at low energies . indeed , as one can see from  ( [ eq : r0_standard ] ) , the saturation radius @xmath98 grows and may substantially exceed the confinement radius .",
    "in order to regularize the low - energy behavior of @xmath98 , we modify eq .",
    "( [ eq : r0_standard ] ) as follows , @xmath99    fit to low - energy photoabsorption data allows to fix this parameter at @xmath100  gev  ( see fig .",

    "further evaluations are done in the lhc energy range , the difference between  ( [ eq : r0_standard ] ) and ( [ eq : r0_modified ] ) is negligible , as one can see from fig .",
