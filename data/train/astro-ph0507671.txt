    "the stars in the milky way are divided into : an old , metal - rich bulge population near the galactic center ; a thin disk population in the plane of the milky way that includes a range of stellar ages and metallicities but is unique in including a young , metal - rich population ; a thick disk population of intermediate age and metallicity ( fraction of elements heavier than helium ) ; and an old , metal - poor spheroid ( also called the stellar halo ) population in which the disks are embedded . each of the populations has a distinct kinematic signature .",
    "the spheroid is generally described as a somewhat spherical population with a density that falls off as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the distance from the center of the galaxy .",
    "a squashing parameter @xmath5 , in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane is also fit to the density distribution of the spheroid by redefining the distance from the galactic center as : @xmath6    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) scans the sky in @xmath7 wide stripes that follow great circles on the sky .",
    "the photometric images are taken in five optical filters : @xmath8 .",
    "data that has been corrected for interstellar reddening using iras dust maps @xcite is designated by a subscripted zero .",
    "three public data releases @xcite are available though an online catalog archive server .",
    "though the survey geometry and technical design @xcite optimized extragalactic research , studies of the galactic stars in the photometric catalog have significantly advanced our knowledge of the stars in the halo of our own galaxy .",
    "in particular , it has been shown @xcite that the distribution of faint f - turnoff stars ( @xmath9 ) that we generally associate with the spheroid population @xcite are not distributed symmetrically about the galaxy center . even if regions surrounding known or suspected tidal streams and debris are eliminated from consideration , the stellar distribution is not symmetric about a plane ( perpendicular to the galactic plane ) through galactic longitudes @xmath10 .",
    "since there are no values of the axisymmetric power law model parameters ( @xmath11 ) which describe an asymmetric distribution , the standard model must be modified to include asymmetric stellar populations , large scale lumpiness , or an asymmetric smooth spheroid component . in this paper",
    ", we make the assumption that there exists a smooth component to the galactic halo , and present several candidate models .",
    "we then use a minimum @xmath12 technique to find the best fit parameters for each model , fitting to eight @xmath7 wide stripes of data in the sdss dr3 .",
    "these stripes are chosen to sample the widest range of positions available in the galaxy from this dataset .",
    "figure  [ stripes ] shows the positions of these data stripes in galactic coordinates .",
    "location of the dr3 data used to fit the spheroid in galactic coordinates .",
    "the grey scale shows spheroid stars selected from dr3 in the manner described in @xcite .",
    "the black lines show the outlines of eight stripes used in this paper to fit the spheroid models .",
    "the sdss stripes numbered are sequentially in a clockwise direction around the coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "this figure shows stripes 10 ( bottom ) and 15 ( top ) in the range @xmath14 ; and stripes 24 , 32 , 37 , 76 , 82 , 86 , top to bottom , in the range @xmath15.,width=432 ]",
    "the simplest extension to the oblate power law spheroid model that allows for asymmetry about the galactic center is a triaxial power law spheroid .",
    "in addition to flattening the spheroid by a factor of @xmath16 in the @xmath17 direction , we flatten by a factor of p in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "this density function with ellipsoidal contours can in general be shifted in three coordinates and rotated by three angles with respect to the galactic coordinates @xmath19 , where @xmath20 goes from the solar position through the center of the galaxy , @xmath18 is in the direction of the local standard of rest ( roughly the direction the sun is going ) , and we have a right - handed coordinate system centered on the center of the milky way .",
    "the principle axes of the density function are : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 initially , we expected that @xmath24 , but the addition of these parameters to the models significantly improved the fits .",
    "we also found that power laws tended to predict too high a star density near the center of the galaxy , compared to our data .",
    "we achieved a better fit to the data with a hernquist profile : @xmath25 although we did explore the possibility of fitting a function of the form : @xmath26 which would include both the power law model ( @xmath27 ) and the hernquist model ( @xmath28 ) , this fitting was abandoned because we are not very sensitive to the combination of @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in general ,",
    "models with @xmath31 worked well .",
    "the data includes all stellar objects in the 8 sdss stripes with : @xmath32 ( to get rid of m stars at faint magnitudes ) , @xmath33 ( to eliminate qsos ) , @xmath34 ( to select stars with turnoff colors ) , and @xmath35 the designation as  star \" in the database removes issues of duplication of objects due to overlaps and deblending .",
    "objects are further rejected if flags indicate that they are saturated , too near the edge of an image to give good photometry , or classified as a  bright \" object .",
    "this resulted in selection of ( 234,306 ; 190,221 ; 159,632 ; 132,637 ; 123,359 ; 115,416 ; 165,620 ; 150,562 ) stars from stripes ( 10 , 15 , 24 , 32 , 37 , 76 , 82 , 86 ) , respectively .",
    "these stripes are shown in figure [ stripes ] .    in order to compare the stellar density to the model density for a given set of parameters ,",
    "the stellar data was sorted into bins that were 0.1 mag .",
    "wide in @xmath36 and @xmath37 in angle along the length of the stripe .",
    "for a given model , the expected number of stars in each bin was calculated as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the distance from the sun , @xmath40 is the magnitude bin size , @xmath41 is the solid angle of each bin ( 2.5 sq . deg . ) , and @xmath42 is the density of our sample of f turnoff stars .    since our models included only stars in a smooth spheroid population , we selected data only from parts of sky and magnitude ranges we thought were most likely to contain exclusively stars from this population .",
    "figures [ stripe37 ] , [ stripe10 ] , [ stripe15 ] , [ stripe24 ] , [ stripe32 ] , [ stripe76 ] , [ stripe82 ] , and [ stripe86 ] show the outlines of the portions of the data that seemed the most likely to contain purely spheroid stars .",
    "bright magnitudes were avoided , particularly near the galactic plane , since they could be contaminated with thick disk stars ( as determined by besancon galaxy models @xcite ) .",
    "stars near any previously identified spheroid overdensity were also avoided .",
    "the models were then modified to reflect the uncertainty in the absolute magnitudes of the turnoff stars , which leads to an uncertainty in the distance to each star .",
    "we analyzed the stars in the three globular clusters pal 5 ( stripe 10 ) , m15 ( stripe 76 ) , and m2 ( stripe 82 ) to determine the turnoff star counts as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "a histogram of star counts vs. @xmath36 magnitude was created by subtracting the star counts in a neighboring piece of sky from the star counts in the direction of the globular cluster . a function of the form : @xmath43 was a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "this is an approximate fit ; each of the clusters had a slightly different magnitude profile .",
    "so that the model took into account this range of absolute magnitudes , we convolved the model with this magnitude distribution , adjusting the amplitude @xmath44 so that the sum of the bins in the convolution kernel was 1.0 . this way , the overall normalization of the model was not affected .",
    "once a set of data was extracted and a set of models was defined , we fit the models to the data by adjusting the model parameters to produce the minimum @xmath12 .",
    "we considered five models : a triaxial hernquist model in which the center was not fixed to the center of the galaxy , a triaxial hernquist model in which the center was forced to the center of the galaxy , a triaxial power law model in which the center was allowed to float , a triaxial power law model in which the center was forced to the center of the galaxy , and a traditional axisymmetric power law model .",
    "the models contained between 4 and 10 free parameters , depending on the model .    for each model",
    ", we chose a starting set of parameters , excluding the normalization @xmath45 , and generated the expected star counts for each bin in the star count data .",
    "we then normalized the model so that the sum of all of the star counts equaled the sum of all of the star counts in the data set ( including all stripes ) that we were fitting .",
    "this had the advantage of reducing by one the number of parameters that were allowed to freely vary , since this one could be computed in a straightforward manner .",
    "the value of @xmath12 for this model and this parameter set is then : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of bins used in all stripes , @xmath48 represents each bin of the data , @xmath49 represents the expected number of counts in that bin in the model , and @xmath50 is the number of parameters fit in the model .",
    "we have assumed that the statistical errors , @xmath51 , in the number of stars in the bins are poisson so that @xmath52 .",
    "we changed the parameters in each model by hand until we achieved the minimum @xmath12 for each model .",
    "the final parameters were checked to guarantee that the fit is worse if any of the parameters are changed by @xmath53 the tolerance ( given in column 2 of table [ modelfits ] ) for that parameter .",
    "if there are 10 adjustable parameters , then @xmath54 parameter sets were checked to ensure a minimum .",
    "the best fit model parameters are given in table [ modelfits ] .",
    "parameters include : @xmath55 , distance from the sun to the galactic center ; @xmath56 , the ratio of the scale length in the @xmath57 directions compared to the major axis in the @xmath58 direction ; @xmath59 , the hernquist core radius ; @xmath60 , the peak of the absolute magnitude distribution of our turnoff stars ; and @xmath45 , the normalization of the hernquist or power law model .",
    "@xmath61 are @xmath62 for a hernquist profile and @xmath63 for a power law profile . to get from galactic",
    "xyz coordinates to the principle axes of the triaxial models , we first shift the center by @xmath64 , then rotate by @xmath65 around the @xmath17-axis , then rotate by @xmath66 around the new @xmath18-axis , and then by @xmath67 around the new @xmath20-axis .",
    "@xmath68 is the density of the selected turnoff stars in the solar neighborhood and @xmath12 , a measure of the goodness of the model fit .",
    "numbers in bold were set to a fixed value and were not allowed to vary .",
    "parameters were fixed either because the definition of the model required it ( for example , power laws all have @xmath27 ) , or because the parameter was correlated with a parameter that was varied .",
    "for instance , in the full hernquist model we set the scale of the model with @xmath59 , though we could instead have varied @xmath60 .",

    "there are 588 stars above background with @xmath81 in pal 5 .",
    "the mass of pal 5 is 4.5 to @xmath82 @xcite . assuming that pal 5 is a good approximation to the stellar population of the spheroid ( a big assumption ) , an estimate of the number of solar masses per sample star is @xmath83star",
    "therefore , the local mass density of the stellar spheroid is 11,000 m@xmath84kpc@xmath85 for the full hernquist model , and 15,000 m@xmath84kpc@xmath85 for the best fit standard power law .",
    "these numbers are 20 - 25 times lower than the average density from _",
    "allen s astrophysical quantities _",
    "@xcite of @xmath86 .",
    "since pal 5 has a bluer turnoff than the spheroid , it is likely that using this cluster to estimate the mass of the spheroid component leads to an underestimate , though it seems unlikely that it could account for the whole difference .",
    "future work will provide a better estimate of the spheroid normalization .",
    "the standard stellar density profile used to fit the galactic spheroid , @xmath87 is an extremely poor fit to the density of halo turnoff stars when a large area of the sky is sampled , even using the unusually large best fit distance between the sun and the galactic center .",
    "the flattening of @xmath88 and the power law slope of @xmath89 are within the range of previously measured values .",
    "triaxial models are best fit with a major axis @xmath90 from the line of sight from the sun to the center of the galaxy and tilted @xmath91 from the galactic plane . the minor axis , @xmath92 from the @xmath17-direction , is about @xmath93 of the scale length of the major axis .",
    "the intermediate axis is about @xmath94 of the scale length of the major axis , and tilted at about @xmath95 from the galactic plane .",
    "these models are clearly favored over the axisymmetric standard model .",
    "the hernquist profile is a better fit to the data than a power law profile , but give roughly similar values for the positional and flattening parameters .",
    "all of the models suggest a lower spheroid stellar density near the sun compared with previous estimates .",
    "if the center of the spheroid profile is allowed to vary , then it moves a surprising 3.0 - 3.5 kpc from the nominal center of the disk in the direction of the sun s motion .",
    "since this is perpendicular to the line of sight from the sun to the galactic center , it is not possible to reduce this offset by simply changing the scale lengths or assumed absolute magnitudes of the sample stars .",
    "it is the stars in the southern stripes near the galactic center that tend to pull the spheroid density off center .",
    "we are still investigating whether there could be unidentified substructure or data quality issues at the root of this surprising result .",
    "clearly , more data in the southern hemisphere would be useful in understanding the large - scale distribution of stars in the halo .    a large fraction of the galactic halo contains known substructure that must be avoided to fit the smooth component .",
