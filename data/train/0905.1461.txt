    "the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) is an interferometric array consisting of thirty 45-m diameter antennas spread over 25 km , operating in frequency bands centred around 151 , 325 , 610/235 , and 1400 mhz .",
    "receivers and feeds for operation at frequencies below 100 mhz are currently not available .",
    "a 50  mhz system for gmrt is being built by the raman research institute , bangalore , to carry out a low frequency survey of the sky visible to gmrt with arcmin resolution and better surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "the survey results and the observing system will be made available to the astronomy community . with a primary beam area of 0.03 steradians ,",
    "a mosaic of about 300 pointings is required to cover the northern sky .",
    "expected survey parameters , at 50  mhz , assuming a 10  mhz bandwidth , are given below and a comparison with other major surveys is given in table  [ t : surveycomparison ] .",
    "nominal system temperature : @xmath0k ( sky dominated ) .    synthesized beam : @xmath1 .",
    "rms sensitivity ( 4  hr synthesis with dual polarization ) : @xmath2  mjy  beam@xmath3 ( thermal noise limited ) .",
    "this is about two orders of magnitude better than the 74  mhz vla survey .",
    "we expect the proposed 50  mhz survey to be at least an order of magnitude better even if we do not achieve the thermal noise limited sensitivity but get limited by the dynamic range .",

    "the main goals of the feed system design were to obtain a reasonable aperture efficiency ( @xmath8 ) , symmetrical e  &  h - plane patterns and , a suitable physical dimension for co - locating it with one of the existing feeds on the gmrt antenna turret , with minimum interference to its operation .",
    "the desired frequency range of operation ( 30 - 90  mhz ) was chosen to facilitate imaging in the band protected for radio astronomy ( around 38  mhz ) , to have an overlap with the 74  mhz system of vla and to minimize the radio frequency interference ( rfi ) due to the fm radio band starting beyond 90  mhz .    a feed system consisting of four folded v - dipoles in a _ boxing - ring _ configuration ( fig .",
    "[ f : feeddesign]a ) was developed since it provides a more symmetric e  &  h - plane patterns than a single dipole feed @xcite .",
    "after extensive simulations and field trials , it was decided to co - locate the new feed with the existing 327  mhz feed ( fig .",
    "[ f : feeddesign]b ) . a v - configuration of the dipole facilitated accommodating the required length of the dipole despite the space constraints .",
    "four gmrt antennas , c04 , c11 , e02 and w02 , were equipped with the new v - dipole feeds .",
    "the maximum east - west baseline , e02-w02 , is @xmath9  km , while the north - south baseline , c04-c11 , is @xmath10  km .",
    "in september 2007 , several 3c sources ( including cyg - a and cas - a ) were observed using the existing gmrt receiver system .",
    "observations of cyg - a , centred at 55  mhz , for an hour showed :    aperture efficiency of @xmath11% .",
    "this is based on the expected background temperature given by @xcite and the flux density of cyg - a given by @xcite .",
    "the rms noise observed in a single channel , with a bandwidth of 31.25  khz , is 6% of the flux density of cyg - a .",
    "the rms of closure phase is @xmath12 , which is as expected for a measured snr of 17 on the amplitude measurement of cyg - a in each baseline .",
    "test observations carried out at gmrt showed that improvement in signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) as a function of bandwidth ( @xmath13 ) and integration time ( @xmath14 ) was not forthcoming when observed using the existing gmrt receiver chain  @xcite .",
    "this is a well known issue with gmrt continuum observations at other frequencies also .",

    "while the reasons for this were not clear , rfi was suspected to be one of the causes . to study",
    "if this limitation could be overcome by digitizing the outputs of the low frequency front - end receivers right at antenna bases , direct voltage recording systems were developed .",

    "for gmrt - hc and gmrt - sc , the if bandwidth was set to 6 mhz .",

    "each 1  s averaged instantaneous time frame was band - normalized using a bandpass template .",
    "any spectral channel above the 4-@xmath5 threshold was flagged as rfi affected channel .",
