    "inductive coupling @xcite is a traditional method to realize the near - field wireless power transfer ( wpt ) for short - range applications in e.g. , centimeters .",
    "recently , magnetic resonant coupling ( mrc ) @xcite has drawn significant interest for implementing the near - field wpt due to its high power transfer efficiency as well as long operation range , say , up to a couple of meters .",
    "furthermore , mrc effectively avoids the power leakage to non - resonant externalities and thus ensures safety to the neighboring environment .",
    "two different methods are commonly adopted in practice to implement mrc enabled wpt ( mrc - wpt ) . in the first method @xcite , resonators , each of which is a tunable rlc circuit ,",
    "are placed in close proximity of the electromagnetic ( em ) coils of the energy transmitters and receivers to efficiently transfer power between them . since resonators are designed to resonate at the system s operating frequency , the total reactive power consumption in the system is effectively minimized at resonance and hence high power transfer efficiency is achieved over longer distance as compared to conventional inductive coupling . in the second method @xcite , series and/or shunt compensators ,",
    "each of which is a capacitor of variable capacity , are embedded in the electric circuits of energy transmitters and receivers with their natural frequencies set same as the system s operating frequency to achieve resonance . generally speaking",
    ", the second method achieves higher power transfer efficiency over the first method , since in the first method resonators incur additional power loss due to their parasitic resistance .",
    "however , the electric circuits of energy transmitters and receivers need to be accessible in the second method to embed compensators in them .",
    "the mrc - wpt system with a single pair of transmitter and receiver has been extensively studied in the literature , with the aims such as maximizing the end - to - end power transfer efficiency or maximizing the power delivered to the receiver s load with a given input power @xcite .",
    "moreover , systems with two transmitters and a single receiver or with a single transmitter and two receivers have been studied in @xcite , while their results can not be directly applied to the systems with more than two transmitters / receivers .",
    "recently , an mrc - wpt system with multiple transmitters and one single receiver has been investigated in @xcite to wirelessly charge a cellphone located at @xmath0 centimeters away , independent of the phone s orientation .",
    "however , the interactions between the energy transmitters and receiver were demonstrated only through simulations in @xcite .",
    "there have been other recent works ( see e.g. @xcite ) on optimizing the performance of mrc - wpt systems with multiple transmitters and one single receiver .",
    "different from the above works , in this paper we consider a _ point - to - multipoint _ mrc - wpt system based on the series compensator method aforementioned , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eleccirtuit ] , where one transmitter that is connected to a stable energy source supplies wireless power to a set of distributed receivers .",
    "each receiver is connected to an electric load via a switch , where the switch connects / disconnects the load to / from the receiver .",
    "[ t ]     we aim to apply signal processing and optimization techniques to the performance characterization and optimization in multiuser mrc - wpt systems .",
    "first , by extending the results in @xcite , we derive _ closed - form _ expressions for the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter and that delivered to the load at each receiver , in terms of mutual inductance among the transmitter and receivers as well as their circuit parameters , for arbitrary number of receivers .",
    "our obtained results reveal a _ near - far _ fairness issue in multiuser wireless power transmission , similar to its counterpart phenomenon in multiuser wireless communication .",
    "specifically , a receiver that is far from the transmitter and thus has a small mutual inductance with the transmitter receives lower power as compared to a receiver that is closer to the transmitter , with other circuit parameters given identical .",
    "next , we propose a method to mitigate the near - far issue by jointly designing the load resistance of all receivers to control their received power by exploiting the mutual coupling effect in the mrc - wpt system .",
    "this is analogous and yet in sharp contrast to the method of adjusting antenna weights at the transmitter to control the received power at different receivers in the existing far - field microwave or radio frequency ( rf ) transmission enabled wpt @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider the scenario where a central controller is equipped at the transmitter to coordinate the multiuser power charging , by assuming that it has the full knowledge of all receivers , including their circuit parameters and power requirements .",
    "the central controller _ jointly _ designs the adjustable load resistance of all receivers to minimize the total power consumed at the transmitter subject to the given minimum power requirement of each load . for ease of practical implementation",
    ", we also consider the scenario without any central controller installed and devise a _ distributed _ algorithm for multiuser charging control by adjusting the loads resistance at their individual receivers in an iterative manner . in our proposed distributed algorithm",
    ", each receiver sets its load resistance independently based on its local information and a one - bit feedback broadcasted by each of the other receivers .",
    "the feedback of each receiver indicates whether the received power of its load exceeds the required minimum power level or not .",
    "it is shown via simulations that the distributed algorithm achieves performance fairly close to the optimal solution by the centralized algorithm with a finite number of iterations .",
    "last , we characterize the _ power region _ for multiuser power transfer which constitutes all the achievable power - tuples for the receiver loads via controlling their adjustable resistance in given ranges . specifically , we introduce the _ time - sharing _ based multiuser power transfer , where the transmission is divided into orthogonal time slots and within each time slot only a selected subset of receivers are scheduled to receive power , while the other receivers are disconnected from their loads .",
    "this is aimed to more flexibly control the mutual coupling effect between the transmitter and receivers in wpt .",
    "it is shown that time sharing can enlarge the power region over the case without time sharing in general .",
    "it is also shown that time sharing can further mitigate the near - fare issue in multiuser wpt by allocating more time to receivers that are more far - away from the transmitter .",
    "furthermore , we extend the centralized multiuser charging control algorithm for the case without time sharing to jointly optimize the time allocation and load resistance for all the receivers in the case with time sharing , to further reduce the transmitter power consumption under the same average power requirement of each load .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the system model .",
    "section iii presents our analytical results .",
    "section iv presents both the centralized and distributed multiuser power charging control algorithms .",
    "section v characterizes and compares the power regions without versus with time sharing .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section vi .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig : eleccirtuit ] , we consider an mrc - wpt system with a single transmitter and @xmath1 receivers , indexed by @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the transmitter and receivers are equipped with em coils for realizing wireless power transfer , while an embedded communication system is assumed to enable information exchange among them.ghz for communication and system control , which is aimed to schedule the charging sequence of receivers and also control their individual charging power according to the given priorities . ] the transmitter is connected to a stable energy source supplying sinusoidal voltage over time given by @xmath4 , with @xmath5 denoting a complex voltage which is assumed to be constant , and @xmath6 denoting its operating angular frequency .",
    "each receiver @xmath2 is connected via a switch to a given electric load ( e.g. , battery charger ) , named load @xmath2 , with adjustable resistance @xmath7 .",
    "the switch is used to connect / disconnect each load to / from its corresponding receiver .",
    "the state of switch at each receiver @xmath2 is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the switch is closed and open , respectively .",
    "it is also assumed that the transmitter and each receiver @xmath2 are compensated using series capacitors with capacities @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath13 , with complex - valued @xmath14 , denote the steady state current flowing through the transmitter .",
    "this current produces a time - varying magnetic flux in the transmitter s em coil , which passes through the em coils of nearby receivers and induces time - varying currents in them .",
    "we denote @xmath15 , with complex - valued @xmath16 , as the steady state current at receiver @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the magnetic flux is the main medium of wireless power transfer considered in this paper , while the electric field is evanescent and thus is ignored @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the rf based far - field wpt @xcite , where the synchronized oscillations of magnetic and electric fields radiate energy in the form of em waves propagating through the air .",
    "we denote @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) as the internal resistance and the self - inductance of the em coil of the transmitter ( receiver @xmath2 ) , respectively .",
    "we also denote the mutual inductance between em coils of the transmitter and each receiver @xmath2 by a real number @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , where its actual value depends on the physical characteristics of the two em coils , their locations , alignment ( or misalignment ) of oriented axes with respect to each other , the environment magnetic permeability , etc .",
    "for example , the mutual inductance of two coaxial circular loops that lie in the parallel planes with separating distance of @xmath23 meter is shown to be proportional to @xmath24 in @xcite . moreover , since the receivers usually employ smaller em coils than that of the transmitter due to practical size limitation and they are also physically separated , we ignore the mutual inductance between any pair of the receivers for simplicity",
    ".    the equivalent electric circuit model of the considered mrc - wpt system is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eleccirtuit ] , in which the natural angular frequencies of the transmitter and each receiver @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we thus set the capacities of compensators capacitors as @xmath27 so that the transmitter and all receivers have the same natural angular frequency as the transmitter voltage source s angular frequency @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "accordingly , we name @xmath28 as the _ resonant angular frequency_.    in this paper , we assume that the transmitter and all receivers are at fixed positions and the physical characteristics of their em coils are _ a priori _ known . as a result , @xmath21 s , @xmath30 ,",
    "are modeled as given constants , which are computed according to appendix e. in practical systems with mobile receivers , @xmath31 s in general change over time and thus need to be measured periodically .",
    "for example , one method that can be used in practice to estimate the mutual inductance between the transmitter and any receiver @xmath2 , is given as follows .",
    "first , by disconnecting the loads at all other receivers @xmath32 , under a known input voltage @xmath33 , the transmitter measures the power drawn from its voltage source , denoted by @xmath34 , due to load @xmath2 only . from ( [ eq : pt ] ) , we can show @xmath35 i.e. , the transmitter can obtain the mutual inductance with receiver @xmath2 by assuming known @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( which can be sent to the transmitter via one - time feedback from receiver @xmath2 ) .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath31 can be determined by comparing the known direction of the current flowing in receiver @xmath2 ( via a one - bit feedback from receiver @xmath2 ) with that assumed at the transmitter .",
    "if the directions are same , then the positive sign is selected for @xmath31 ; otherwise , the negative sign is set .    in this paper , we treat the load resistance @xmath38 s , @xmath39 , as design parameters , which can be adjusted in real time to control the performance of our considered mrc - wpt system based on the information shared among different nodes in the system , via the embedded communication system . note that an electric load with any fixed resistance can be connected via a rectifier in parallel with a boost ( or triboost ) converter to each receiver to realize an adjustable resistance @xcite .",
    "specifically , given the fixed input voltage , the on / off time intervals of the converter can be controlled in real time to change the average current flowing into the load , which is equivalent to adjusting the load resistance .",
    "in this section , we present new analytical results on the performance of the mrc - wpt system with arbitrary number of receivers . a numerical example is also provided to validate our analysis and draw useful insights . here",
    ", we assume that all receiver switches are closed , i.e. , @xmath9 , @xmath39 ; as a result , the transmitter sends wireless power to all loads concurrently .      by applying kirchhoff s circuit laws to the electric circuit model given in fig .",
    "[ fig : eleccirtuit ] , we have @xmath40 from ( [ eq : c0 ] ) and ( [ eq : cn ] ) , we can set @xmath41 and @xmath42 in ( [ eq : trans ] ) and ( [ eq : reciv ] ) , respectively .",
    "this is due to the fact that the transmitter and all receivers are designed to resonate at the same angular frequency @xmath28 . by solving the set of linear equations given in ( [ eq : trans ] ) and ( [ eq : reciv ] ) , we can derive @xmath43 and @xmath44 s as functions of the input voltage @xmath33 as follows : @xmath45 the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter , i.e. , @xmath34 , and that delivered to each load @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath46 ,",
    "are then obtained as @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the conjugate of @xmath43 . from ( [ eq : pl ] ) , it follows that the power delivered to each load @xmath2 increases with the mutual inductance between em coils of its receiver and the transmitter , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "this can cause a _ near - far _ fairness issue since a receiver that is far from the transmitter generally has a small mutual inductance with the transmitter ; as a result , its received power is lower than that at a receiver that is closer to the transmitter ( thus has a larger mutual inductance ) .",
    "furthermore , we define @xmath49 as the _ sum - power _ delivered to all loads , where it can be verified from ( [ eq : pt ] ) and ( [ eq : pl ] ) that @xmath50 . the sum - power _ transfer efficiency _ , denoted by @xmath51 , is thus expressed as @xmath52    [ remark:1 ] when the receivers are all weakly coupled to the transmitter , e.g. , they are sufficiently far away from the transmitter , we have @xmath53 , @xmath39 . in this regime ,",
    "from ( [ eq : pt ] ) , it follows that the transmitter power is @xmath54 , which is a function of the resistance and voltage of the transmitter only . on the other hand , from ( [ eq : pl ] )",
    ", it follows that the power delivered to each load @xmath2 is @xmath55 , which is irrespective of the other receivers mutual inductance and resistance .",
    "the above results can be explained as follows . with @xmath53 , @xmath39 ,",
    "the power transfered to the receivers is small and thus can be neglected as compare to the power loss due to the transmitter s resistance . as a result , we have @xmath56 , with @xmath57 .",
    "it also can be verified that with @xmath53 , @xmath39 , the coupling effect among the receivers through the transmitter current @xmath43 is negligible .",
    "hence , the power delivered to the load at each receiver is independent of other receivers ( similar to the far - field rf based wpt @xcite ) .    [",
