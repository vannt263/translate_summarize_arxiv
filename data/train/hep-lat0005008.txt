    "in recent years remarkable progress has been made towards formulations of lattice fermions which have no doublers and possess an exact chiral symmetry without giving up desirable features like flavor symmetry , locality , unitarity or gauge - invariance .",
    "the ginsparg - wilson relation  @xcite @xmath1 has been recognized  @xcite as the fundamental condition in this context , and a dirac operator @xmath2 which satisfies this relation can indeed describe chiral fermions on the lattice .",
    "one of the possible solutions of the ginsparg - wilson relation has been found by neuberger  @xcite starting from the overlap formalism  @xcite . in the massless case",
    "the overlap - dirac operator is @xmath3 , \\label{eq : dn}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 in terms of the usual wilson - dirac operator @xmath5 , \\ ] ] @xmath6 .\\ ] ] in the range @xmath7 the right spectrum of massless fermions is obtained  @xcite . for a quark of bare mass @xmath8",
    "the overlap - dirac operator becomes @xmath9 since additive mass renormalization is forbidden , one avoids altogether a source of systematic errors that is always present with wilson fermions  @xcite .",
    "lscher has shown  @xcite that a fermion obeying the ginsparg - wilson relation possesses an exact chiral symmetry of the general form @xmath10 a fully legitimate form of global chiral symmetry is thus preserved for finite lattice spacing .",
    "the expected value of the global anomaly  @xcite ( which comes from the non - invariance of the fermionic integration measure under the transformations above ) , the atiyah - singer index theorem on the lattice  @xcite and the chiral ward identities are then fully attained before taking the continuum limit .",
    "thus , the central point in this framework is not to insist on the lattice form of the canonical chiral transformations ( in fact actions satisfying eq .  ( [ eq : gw ] ) are not chirally invariant in the canonical sense ) , but rather be satisfied with a modified form of the chiral symmetry .",
    "the nielsen - ninomyia theorem  @xcite is then circumvented altogether , and it is possible to define chiral fermions without doublers or breaking of flavor symmetry or other unpleasant drawbacks .",
    "the chiral transformations ( [ eq : symmetry ] ) depend also on the interaction , but this does not forbid the non - perturbative construction of chiral gauge theories on the lattice with exact gauge invariance  @xcite . for recent reviews on the interesting properties of fermions satisfying the ginsparg - wilson relation , see refs .",
    ".    we will be interested in the following in performing chiral - invariant computations by using the overlap - dirac operator ( [ eq : dn ] ) .",
    "this has been proven to be local  @xcite , and although simulations with the neuberger operator look computationally very demanding , progress is under way  @xcite .",
    "there has been activity also on the analytic side , and some 1-loop calculations with overlap fermions have been already carried out  @xcite .",
    "the most recent and advanced calculations have featured the relation between the @xmath11 parameter in the lattice scheme defined by the overlap operator and in the @xmath12 scheme  @xcite , and the renormalization factors of the quark bilinears @xmath13",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the calculation in lattice qcd of the renormalization factors of a few operators which measure the lowest two moments of non - singlet quark distributions .",
    "the generic operators which measure their @xmath14-th moments are @xmath15 and @xmath16 for unpolarized and polarized structure functions respectively .",
    "contrary to what happens with wilson fermions , in the present case , thanks to the exact chiral symmetry that we maintain , the renormalization constants for every pair of corresponding unpolarized and polarized operators which differ by a @xmath0 matrix are the same .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we introduce the various operators that we have studied , in sect",
    ".  3 their renormalization on the lattice is discussed , and in sect .",
    "4 some details about the perturbative calculations are given . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we present our results . in the appendices one can find the feynman rules that we have used as well as some analytic results .",
    "the hadronic physics in deep inelastic scattering is contained in the matrix elements of the t - product of the hadronic currents @xmath17 @xmath18 being the momentum transfer and @xmath19 the target momentum .",
    "an operator product expansion on the light cone of the kind @xmath20 describes the physics in the bjorken limit , in which scaling is reached and the structure functions depend only on the bjorken variable @xmath21 .",
    "the moments of the structure functions , which measure the moments of quark distributions , are directly connected to the forward matrix elements of the local operators appearing in the light - cone expansion . since the divergence of the wilson coefficients is governed by the twist ( dimension minus spin ) of the corresponding operators , infinite towers of operators of increasing dimension and spin but with the same twist ( dimension minus spin ) appear at a given order in @xmath22 .",
    "the dominant contribution is given by twist two , which in the flavor non - singlet case means the symmetric traceless operators @xmath23 where @xmath24 are flavor matrices ( which in the following will be omitted and implicitly understood ) .",
    "these operators measure the moment of unpolarized and polarized structure functions respectively , that is the moments @xmath25 of quark momentum distributions and the moments @xmath26 of quark helicity distributions , at leading twist .",
    "higher - twist operators give the sub - dominant contributions , and in particular twist-4 operators ( which include also 4-fermion operators ) measure the @xmath22 corrections to these moments  @xcite .",
    "since we are considering flavor non - singlet operators , there can be no mixing with operators like @xmath27 and @xmath28 which measure the gluon distributions . mixing with these operators",
    "is prohibited even when one considers unquenched calculations .",
    "singlet quark operators instead do mix with gluon operators . for more detailed discussions of deep inelastic scattering on the lattice , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the operators in the light - cone expansion ( [ eq : ope ] ) of which we compute the renormalization factors are the following : @xmath29 which measure the first moment of quark momentum distributions , @xmath30 which measure the first moment of quark helicity distributions , @xmath31 which measure the second moment of quark momentum distributions , and @xmath32 which measure the second moment of quark helicity distributions .",
    "symmetrization in all lorentz indices is understood .",
    "we use @xmath33 , with the following lattice discretizations : @xmath34 \\\\ \\bar{\\psi } ( x ) \\stackrel{\\leftarrow}{d_\\mu } & = & \\frac{1}{2a } \\big [ \\bar{\\psi } ( x+a\\hat{\\mu } ) u^\\dagger ( x,\\mu ) - \\bar{\\psi}(x - a\\hat{\\mu } )   u(x - a\\hat{\\mu},\\mu ) \\big ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have chosen the lorentz indices of each operator appearing in the continuum expansion in two different ways , so that they fall in two different representations of the hypercubic group ( the symmetry group of the lattice , remnant of the lorentz symmetry ) , and on the lattice they will then renormalize in a different way .",
    "the representations where the indices are all different from each other are least likely to mix with other operators , however one needs more components of the hadron momentum different from zero when simulating the corresponding matrix elements , and this can lead to more lattice artifacts .",
    "sometimes one of the representations can be easier to handle in practice , depending on the trade - off between the amount of mixing and the number of non - zero momentum components .",
    "for example , in the case of the second moment the operator ( [ eq:2ud ] ) is multiplicatively renormalized , but it can be more advantageous to use the other representation ( operator ( [ eq:2ue ] ) ) when it is important that fewer components of the momenta are different from zero , although in this case one has then to deal with a mixing .",
    "the operator ( [ eq:2ue ] ) ( together with the corresponding polarized ( [ eq:2pe ] ) ) is the only one in the list above that is not multiplicatively renormalized on the lattice .",
    "what happens is that that the two operators @xmath35 which are not symmetrized in their indices , do not receive the same 1-loop corrections on the lattice  @xcite , and so the operator ( [ eq:2ue ] ) , @xmath36 does not go into itself under lattice renormalization , because the symmetric combination is lost . in the polarized case ,",
    "an analogous situation occurs for @xmath37 a detailed discussion of these effects can be found in sect .",
    "we mention that for the second moment there exists also a third independent lattice representation , in which all indices are equal .",
    "however , it mixes with a lower dimensional operator with a power - divergent coefficient ( @xmath38 ) , and so we do not consider it here .",
    "to relate the numbers obtained from monte carlo simulations to physical continuum quantities , a lattice renormalization of the relevant matrix elements is necessary .",
    "the connection is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the continuum and lattice 1loop expressions respectively , and the tree - level matrix element is the same in both cases .",
    "the differences @xmath41 enter then in the renormalization factors @xmath42 which connect the lattice to the continuum .",
    "these renormalization factors are independent of the state , depend only on the scale @xmath43 and are gauge - invariant . using them",
    ", a matrix element obtained from monte carlo simulations can be renormalized to a continuum scheme .",
    "although there are in principle also non - perturbative methods with which one can determine the renormalization factors , perturbation theory is still important .",
    "in fact , it can happen that for some operators a window for the non - perturbative signal is difficult to obtain , and then perturbation theory remains the only possibility of computing the relevant renormalization factors . for the neuberger operator , extracting the non - perturbative renormalization factors in addition to simulating the bare matrix elements could turn out to be computationally very expensive .",
    "in general , perturbative lattice renormalization is important as a hint and a guide for non  perturbative renormalization studies , and even more when mixings are present , which are generally more intricate than in the continuum case , and more transparent when looked at in perturbation theory , especially if some amounts of mixings are small .",
    "perturbative renormalization can in any case be very useful in checking and understanding results obtained with non - perturbative methods .",
    "in the continuum we renormalize the operators in the @xmath44 scheme . as perturbative renormalization condition on the lattice",
    "we impose that the 1-loop amputated matrix elements at a certain reference scale @xmath45 are equal to the corresponding bare tree  level quantities . for lattice matrix elements of multiplicatively renormalized operators computed between one - quark states",
    "this condition means @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the wave - function renormalization , computed from the quark self - energy .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ]    the 1-loop lattice matrix elements of the operators we consider here , which are at most logarithmically divergent , will have the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the finite contribution of the vertex and sails diagrams ( a , b and c in fig .  1 ) , @xmath50 refers to the tadpole arising from the operator ( d in fig .  1 )",
    ", s is the finite contribution ( proportional to @xmath51 ) of the quark self - energy of one leg , including the leg tadpole ( e and g , or f and h , in fig .  1 ) , and @xmath52 . the @xmath53 factor for an operator @xmath54 will then be given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 we will call `` proper '' contributions the ones that exclude the self - energy diagrams .",
    "they correspond to the diagrams a - d in fig .  1 .",
    "although the theory defined by the overlap - dirac operator ( [ eq : dn ] ) has an exact chiral symmetry and no lattice artifacts of order @xmath57 are present in the action , matrix elements of operators still possess corrections of order @xmath57 and therefore they need to be improved .",
    "the improved operator corresponding to @xmath58 is  @xcite @xmath59 and the big bonus with overlap fermions is that the renormalization factors for the improved operator and for the unimproved operator without the rotations @xmath60 are the same .",
    "what happens is that in 1-loop amplitudes a factor @xmath61 can combine with a quark propagator , but since it has an @xmath57 in front and ( contrary to the wilson case ) there is no @xmath62 factor in the propagator , as additive mass renormalization is forbidden by chiral symmetry , the contribution of @xmath61 to the renormalization factors is zero  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can simulate the improved operator ( [ eq : opimp ] ) and renormalize it as if it were the unimproved operator , which saves a lot in the perturbative calculations .",
    "chiral symmetry , in addition to avoiding the extrapolations to zero quark mass in the simulations , gives also useful constraints on the mixing patterns and on the values of the renormalization factors .",
    "in general , mixings that in the wilson case were allowed by the breaking of chirality are now forbidden , although this has less relevance here than in other problems like in weak interactions  @xcite .",
    "an important consequence here is that , similarly to what happens in the case of the bilinears where we have @xmath63 and @xmath64  @xcite , chiral symmetry forces pairs of corresponding unpolarized and polarized operators , like @xmath65 and @xmath66 , to have the same renormalization constants  ) , which transform like chiral multiplets , but since they have the same renormalization constants as the unimproved operators , these symmetry relations are preserved . ] .",
    "the interaction vertices and the propagator of the overlap - dirac operator are much more complicated than the ones in the wilson formulation , and this causes the computations to be rather cumbersome ( see appendices ) .",
    "computer programs need then to be introduced , and we have performed the calculations using an ensemble of routines written in the symbolic manipulation language form .",
    "these routines are an extension of the ones used to do calculations with the wilson action in various occasions  @xcite .",
    "the outputs of the form codes , which correspond to the results of the analytic calculations , are fed to fortran programs which perform the numerical integrations . to treat the divergent integrals",
    "we use the kawai method  @xcite , in which they are split in integrals independent of external momenta plus continuum integrals .",
    "divergent lattice integrals which contain both gluon and overlap - quark propagators are reduced to divergent integrals containing only gluon propagators , which are computed in a exact way as in  @xcite , plus a finite rest .",
    "many checks have been performed on our results .",
    "we did the computations in a general covariant gauge  ] ] , and the cancellations of the gauge - dependent parts between the continuum scheme and the lattice results is a strong check on the good behavior of the form codes , as well as of the integration routines .",
    "we have used the codes to compute also the renormalization constants for all quark bilinears , and we agree with the results given in feynman - gauge by alexandrou et al .",
    "@xcite , as well as with their self - energy . in the case of the leg tadpole and of the vertex graph of the scalar current @xmath67",
    "we have also made the computations entirely by hand ( although only in the feynman gauge ) , and successfully checked them against the form output expressions .",
    "these analytic results are reported in appendix b. we tried to do a calculation by hand for a first moment operator and for the rest of the leg self - energy , but they involved a huge amount of manipulations .",
    "we rely also on the vast amount of results which have been produced in different occasions using these form codes limited to the wilson formulation  @xcite , and these results have by now a certain number of cross - checks . with overlap fermions",
    "we need to introduce a new propagator and new vertices , but the operators are unaltered , and the same wilson expressions for their expansion in @xmath57 can be used here . many of the routines ( for example the gamma algebra reduction ) are also exactly the same as in the wilson case .",
    "we checked in all cases that the polarized operators have the same @xmath68s as the corresponding unpolarized operators .",
    "this is a rather strong check , as the analytic results are widely different for the two cases , and it is only after performing the numerical integrations and seeing that the difference of the two results is much smaller than the precision of our integrals that we able to say that the renormalization factors are indeed equal .",
    "finally , since our codes are able to do calculations both in dimensional regularization and using a mass regularization , we also checked that using two different intermediate regularizations while treating the divergences with the kawai method  @xcite we get the same results .",
    "we obtain the @xmath69 constants with 5 digits after the decimal points , by doing the numerical integrations on a @xmath70 regular grid and using the method proposed by lscher and weisz in  @xcite to accelerate convergence .",
    "we have checked that these digits do not vary when a @xmath71 integration grid is used . in any case , to get more significant digits , grids of @xmath72 or @xmath73 points would still not be enough , and they would require an enormous computational effort , as a typical form output for the second moment operators already contains thousands of terms .",
    "comparing our results for the self - energy and the bilinears with the numbers in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can see that a few times a difference of one unit on the fifth digit can be noticed , and this agrees with our estimate of errors . in that paper",
    "the results are given in terms of the constants @xmath74 , and this explains the presence of two more significant digits after the decimal point .",
    "we give in this section the renormalization factors of the operators considered in this work . that these factors are identical for pairs of corresponding unpolarized and polarized operators",
    "has been explicitly verified for all operators .",
    "we give then the numerical results only for the unpolarized operators , for @xmath75 .",
