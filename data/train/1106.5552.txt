    "this paper presents an analysis of the @xmath0-carbon cross section data from the karmen @xcite and lsnd @xcite experiments , within the context of electron neutrino oscillations at high @xmath1 . in a two - neutrino oscillation formalism , the probability for @xmath0 disappearance is given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mixing angle ; @xmath6 , in ev@xmath7 , is the difference between the squared neutrino masses ; @xmath8 , in m , is the distance from the neutrino source to the detector ; and @xmath9 , in mev , is the neutrino energy .",
    "this analysis exploits the fact that karmen and lsnd were located at @xmath1017.7 m and 29.8 m respectively .",
    "we use the consistency between the cross section measurements to place strong constraints on @xmath0 disappearance at @xmath11  ev@xmath7 .",
    "this study is motivated by recent results that can be interpreted as oscillations with @xmath12  ev@xmath7 .",
    "the strongest evidence comes from the lsnd experiment , which observed a @xmath13 signal corresponding to an oscillation probability of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "recent miniboone antineutrino data @xcite are in agreement with lsnd , although with less significance , while the miniboone neutrino data do not support @xmath15 oscillations @xcite .",
    "high @xmath1 muon - to - electron flavor appearance can not be explained in a three neutrino mixing model that also incorporates `` solar '' and `` atmospheric '' oscillations @xcite . as a result",
    ", these data have inspired models with three active and one sterile ( 3 + 1 ) or 2 sterile ( 3 + 2 ) neutrinos .",
    "sterile neutrinos ( @xmath16 ) do not interact via the weak interaction , but can mix with and cause oscillations between , the active flavors .",
    "these models predict a @xmath17 signal @xcite with a large @xmath1 ( on the order of a few ev@xmath7 ) compared to the splittings between the light states ( of order @xmath18 and @xmath19 ev@xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , one can take the three light states to be effectively degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy simplifies the 3 + 1 model to an approximate two - neutrino oscillation model for both appearance and disappearance . as a result ,",
    "eq .  [ osc ] will be applicable to the following discussion , where we will use @xmath20 as the mixing angle relevant to @xmath0 disappearance .",
    "recently , a reanalysis of reactor @xmath21 flux predictions @xcite has provoked further interest in electron flavor disappearance in 3 + 1 models @xcite .",
    "this new analysis resulted in a shift of the ratio of reactor data - to - prediction from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "this deficit with respect to prediction is called the `` reactor anomaly '' in this paper .",
    "this can be taken as indication of @xmath24 in a 3 + 1 model at 98.6% cl @xcite .",
    "the best fit is @xmath25 ev@xmath7 and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "indications of @xmath0 disappearance have arisen from calibration data taken by the sage @xcite and gallex @xcite experiments .",
    "these used megacurie sources of @xmath27cr and @xmath28ar to calibrate the @xmath29 experiments",
    ". the data from sage and gallex are consistent , and show a measured - to - predicted ratio of @xmath30 @xcite .",

    "the best fit in a 3 + 1 model corresponds to a @xmath31 ev@xmath7 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this apparent @xmath0 disappearance signal leads to the argument @xcite that @xmath17 , consistent with the gallium data , must be applied to the intrinsic @xmath0 background of the miniboone @xmath15 search @xcite .     ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the results of the 3 + 1 models have provoked substantial interest within the community , but they are not decisive . as a result",
    "they are a prime motivation for further studies of electron neutrino disappearance @xcite .",
    "there are few opportunities for precision @xmath0 disappearance searches , since most beams have large uncertainties in the normalization and energy distribution for the @xmath0 and @xmath33 beam contents .",
    "however , decay - at - rest ( dar ) neutrino beams can provide a unique window on electron - flavor neutrino oscillations .",

    "considering fits to these two data sets separately allows interpretation of certain features in the combined fit .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ individual ] that the karmen data dominates at high @xmath1 because of statistics and that the large variations in the limit are driven by this data set .",
    "these variations appear because the event energy distribution spans a limited range . as a result , there are oscillation parameters for which the karmen distance allows the experiment to either be very sensitive or very insensitive to disappearance .",
    "the lsnd data set allows full oscillation at @xmath1 of 3.9 ev@xmath7 , but karmen data does not . at low @xmath1 , the sensitivity is dominated by the lsnd data although the combination with karmen is significantly better .",
    "the limit presented here and the gallium data represent the only electron neutrino disappearance results in this @xmath1 range . comparison to other data sets require interpretation within models .",
    "specific global analyses are beyond the scope of this paper , however , we can consider the impact of the limit , in general .",
    "cpt conservation requires that @xmath0 and @xmath21 disappearance should occur at the same rate . because cpt conservation is embedded in all field theories , comparison of electron flavor neutrino and antineutrino disappearance is widely regarded as interesting .",
    "the relavent antineutrino disappearance data comes from the reactor experiments .",
    "the recently published reactor anomaly hints at oscillations , and the parameters from the @xmath21 disappearance data @xcite can be compared to the @xmath0 results assuming cpt conserving models .    in fig .",
    "[ reactcontour ] , we overlay the reactor anomaly allowed region at 68% and 90% cl with the 95% cl limit from this paper using fukugita . in this figure , we use a log scale for @xmath75 so that the reactor allowed region is clear .",
    "one can see that portions of the allowed reactor space will be excluded in fits that require cpt conservation .",
    "however , the reactor anomaly best fit parameters give a @xmath63 probability of 90.8% , which lies outside of the 95% cl excluded region from the cross section analysis limit , and one expects portions of the allowed region to survive in a global fit .",
    "the comparison of the best fit with data , shown as the thin line with dots in fig .  [ fits ] , is reasonably good and similar to the  no oscillation \" case , illustrating why the karmen / lsnd data does not speak to the entire region of the reactor anomaly .",
    "this is consistent with good the @xmath60/dof for the best fit point of the reactor anomaly , reported in table  [ chi2 ] .",
    "disappearance limit from the fukugita ( ept ) fit ( solid , black line ) and kolbe ( crpa ) fit compared to the 90% ( shaded region ) contours from the reactor anomaly .",
    "[ reactcontour ] , title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +    comparisons to electron - to - muon flavor appearance data is much more model dependent than the comparison of @xmath21 to @xmath0 disappearance . in this case",
    ", one must go beyond choosing whether or not to assume cpt conservation , to include the number of sterile neutrinos ( typically , one assumes 3 + 1 or 3 + 2 models ) ; the mass heirarchy ( a 1 + 3 + 1 model has recently been published @xcite as a variation of the two sterile neutrino case ) ; and whether or not to include cp violation .",
    "inclusion of the appearance data also , necessarily , requires reference to muon - flavor disappearance as well as electron flavor disappearance , since these are all realted .",
    "as an example , in a 3 + 1 model : @xmath76 where @xmath77 represents the element in the 4-neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the disappearance limit we present here , when interpreted within eq .  [ ediseq ] , substantially limits the range of @xmath78 , and will considerably reduce the space of allowed values for matrix elements that can describe muon - to - electron flavor appearance in neutrino mode , as may be implied by the miniboone low energy excess @xcite . while the correspondences between experimentally measured mixing angles and the underlying matrix elements for two - sterile - neutrino models is more complicated , the basic point still applies",
    "this analysis has used the @xmath79 cross section data from lsnd and karmen to constrain the amount of @xmath0 disappearance oscillations at high @xmath1 . the good agreement between the data sets and with the theory , despite different distances of detectors from the source , leads to an 95% cl exclusion region which extends down to @xmath80 at high @xmath1 and to considerably lower values for some @xmath1 ranges .",
    "comparison to another underlying cross section model does not significantly change the excluded region .",
    "the data are in disagreement with the only other @xmath0 disappearance data set in this @xmath1 region , which comes from the gallium experiments .",
    "large portions of the allowed region for @xmath0 disappearance analysis of the gallium calibration data are ruled out at @xmath295% cl . as a benchmark , the best fit point for gallium",

    "@xcite , that incorporate @xmath0 disappearance to explain the observed energy distribution .    assuming cpt conservation , this data set can be compared to the @xmath33 disappearance from reactor data .",
