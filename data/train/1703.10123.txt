    "a 125 gev standard model ( sm ) like higgs boson @xcite was discovered by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite in 2012 .",

    "the higgs boson is treated as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson corresponding to one of the broken generators thus it can be naturally light @xcite . the simplest little higgs ( slh ) model @xcite is one of such kind of models which has the minimal extended scalar sector . in the slh model , the global symmetry breaking @xmath7 ^ 2\\rightarrow[\\textrm{su}(2)\\times\\textrm{u}(1)]^2 $ ] happens at high scale @xmath8 , and the gauge group @xmath9 breaks to the electro - weak ( ew ) gauge group @xmath10 at the same scale @xcite . in the cp - conserving case ,",
    "the slh model contains two scalars @xcite that one is a sm - like higgs boson and the other is a pseudoscalar which can be at the ew scale or even lighter @xcite .",
    "cp - violation was discovered in 1964 through the @xmath11 rare decay process @xcite .",
    "more cp - violation effects have been discovered in k and b meson sectors @xcite .",
    "the kobayashi - maskawa ( k - m ) mechanism @xcite is successful to explain all the measured cp - violation effects @xcite .",
    "however , it is still necessary to search for new cp - violation sources , since the sm with k - m mechanism itself can not generate large enough matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe @xcite . in the extensions of the sm",
    ", there may be additional sources of cp - violation .",
    "for example , if we add more complex scalar singlets or doublets , there may be cp - violation in scalar sector @xcite which can leads to a cp - mixing higgs boson .",

    "however , a cp - mixing higgs boson is still allowed since the contribution from pseudoscalar component should be loop suppressed . ] in some of these models with cp - violation , the lagrangian is cp - conserved and cp - violation is only generated from complex vacuum thus we say the cp - symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "this mechanism was proposed by lee in 1973 @xcite as the first kind of two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite . moreover ,",
    "spontaneous cp - violation is also a possible solution of the strong cp problem @xcite , and it may also have further connection with lightness of the higgs boson @xcite .    in the composite framework ,",
    "spontaneous cp - violation in the scalar sector can also occur .",
    "for example , in the @xmath13 model ( which is equivalent to the @xmath14 model as the next - to - minimal composite model ) @xcite , there are two scalars like the slh model , and cp - violation can be spontaneously induced when the pseudoscalar field acquires vev .",

    "these numerical results above are based on @xmath128 away from @xmath147 which means a large @xmath274 .",
