    "our basic point of view is that the confinement and hadronization of quarks take place on the same distances .",
    "it means that the knowledge of behavior of quark and gluon propagators on these distances give us direct way to calculate meson masses using the bethe - salpeter equation in ladder approximation if the coupling constant @xmath6 is small enough .    within the standard approaches of qcd the quark and gluon propagators in the confinement region",
    "are not obtained yet , so that different symmetry arguments leading to some effective theory are used to avoid direct calculations .    in the papers @xcite we developed the approach based on the assumption that the qcd vacuum is realized by the self - dual homogeneous vacuum gluon field which is the classical solution of the yang - mills equations .",
    "the propagators of quarks and gluons in this field can be calculated in the explicit form and they are entire analytic functions in @xmath7-complex plain .",
    "it means that the self - dual homogeneous vacuum gluon field leads to the analytic confinement of quarks .",
    "manifestation of this gluon configuration in the spectrum and weak decays of light mesons , their exited states , glueballs were studied in papers @xcite .",
    "our calculations showed that the self - dual homogeneous gluon field can be considered as a good candidate to realize qcd gluon vacuum .",
    "however any calculations in this model are quite cumbersome so that it is difficult to `` see forest among trees '' .",
    "i always wanted to find some simple formulas which could have some general physical consequences .",
    "i think this idea is realized in present paper .",
    "physical arguments are the following .",
    "bound states are formed on large distances where confinement plays the main role . so that the correct description of confinement should lead to reasonable description of bound states .",
    "mesons as quark - antiquark bound states are characterized by different quantum numbers which should be taken into account for detailed description of meson characteristics . however",
    "if the analytical confinement really takes place then one can get some general dynamic properties of meson spectrum which weakly depend on quantum numbers .",
    "we use the functional integral techniques to calculate mass spectrum of bound states . in this techniques representation of the bethe - salpeter kernel with propagators , which are entire analytical functions of the gaussian type ,",
    "has some specific features leading to consequences which can be checked on the real meson spectrum .",
    "namely this kernel is product of a polynomial depending on quantum numbers and an exponent which is function of quark masses and mass of the bound state under consideration and which gives the main contribution into integral .",
    "thus we can expect that in the lowest semiquantative approximation the meson masses are defined by an universal function depending on masses of constituent quarks and dependence on quantum numbers can be approximated by a constant .",
    "let us consider the particle data group @xcite .",
    "one can extract some sets of mesons having the same quantum numbers @xmath0 , but different flavors constitutes .",
    "there are five sets of mesons having as constituents all four quarks @xmath8 .",
    "these sets are : pseudoscalar @xmath9 - ten mesons , vector @xmath10 - eight mesons , scalar @xmath11 - four mesons , axial @xmath12 - five mesons , tensor @xmath13 - six mesons ( see section 3 ) .",
    "in addition we consider tensor multiplet @xmath14 , containing three light mesons .",
    "thus we expect that the masses of these mesons with quantum numbers @xmath0 and quark constituents @xmath1 are described by the formula @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an universal function , form of which does not depend on quantum state .",
    "a constant parameter @xmath3 defines quantum state and it is unique for all mesons with quantum number @xmath0 .    the aim of this paper is to show that the representation ( [ muniv ] ) really takes place and to clarify additional conditions providing this formula .",
    "the equation on the mass @xmath17 of a bound state of two constituent quarks with masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 in framework of the bethe - salpeter equation in ladder approximation looks as ( see @xcite ) @xmath20 here the polarization operator is @xmath21 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quark - antiquark vertex @xmath22 defines the quantum numbers of the bound state under consideration .",
    "all calculations will be performed in the euclidean space @xmath23 .",
    "the quark propagator is chosen in the form induced by a vacuum self - dual gluon field with constant strength ( see details in @xcite ) @xmath24 the parameter @xmath25 defines the confinement scale .",
    "the explicit form of the polynomial @xmath26 over variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 will be not important in our calculations here but it can be found in @xcite .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath29    the vertex function @xmath30 is determined by the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation , but with acceptable accuracy it can be approximated on large distances @xmath31 by @xmath32    the qcd coupling constant is defined by the standard way @xmath33    thus the mass of a bound state with quantum number @xmath34 is defined by the equation @xmath35\\\\ & = & { \\alpha_s\\over\\pi}\\int\\!\\!\\!\\int\\limits_0 ^ 1 du_1du_2 p_q(u_1,u_2,\\mu,\\mu_1,\\mu_2)e^{{(m_1+m_2)^2\\over2\\lambda^2 } e(\\mu,\\mu_1,\\mu_2,u_1,u_2)}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath36 is a polynomial over parameters @xmath37 and its explicit form is defined by the spin structure of verteces and quark propagators .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath38 of bound states are defined by this polynomials .",
    "the explicit form of this polynomials will be not important in our arguments .",
    "the function @xmath39 plays the main role in the equation ( [ masseq ] ) and its behavior defines the meson mass spectrum .",
    "it is important that this function depends on masses of constituent quarks @xmath18 and @xmath19 and does not depend on quantum numbers of bound states , so that we can hope that the main features of a set of mesons with the same quantum number @xmath40 are defined by masses of constituent quarks only .",
    "let us consider the behavior of the function @xmath41 .",
    "let us note bounds of changing of our parameters : @xmath42    in the case @xmath43 ( the meson mass is less then sum of masses of constituent quarks @xmath44 ) , the function @xmath41 is negative and main contribution into the integral ( [ masseq ] ) gives the vicinity of the point @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "then @xmath47 and the solution of the mass equation requires strong coupling regime @xmath48 .    in the case",
    "@xmath49 ( the meson mass @xmath17 is more then sum of masses of constituent quarks @xmath44 ) , the function @xmath41 is positive and has a positive maximum in a point @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "thus one can write approximately @xmath52 where @xmath53 the parameter @xmath54 contains all information about quantum numbers of states under consideration .",
    "we can suppose that @xmath54 depends weakly on mass parameters @xmath37 .",
    "calculations of the maximum in ( [ emax ] ) in the region ( [ param ] ) give the approximate formula @xmath55 \\left({m\\over m_1+m_2}-1\\right)^{1.6}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus the equation ( [ masseq ] ) can be approximated by @xmath56    the solution of this mass equation requires weak coupling regime @xmath57 .",
