    "understanding human behavior has long been recognized as one of the keys to understanding epidemic spreading @xcite , which has triggered intense research activity aimed at including social complexity in epidemiological models .",
    "age structure @xcite , human mobility  @xcite and very detailed data at the individual level  @xcite are now incorporated in most of the realistic models . however , much remains to be done .",
    "models based on social mobility and behavior @xcite have shown to be valuable tools in the quantitative analysis of the unfolding of the recent h1n1 pandemic @xcite , but it has become clear that societal reactions coupling behavior and disease spreading can have substantial impact on epidemic spreading @xcite thus defining limitations of most current modeling approaches  @xcite .",
    "societal reactions can be grouped into different classes .",
    "first , there are changes imposed by authorities through the closure of schools , churches , public offices , and bans on public gatherings @xcite .",
    "second , individuals self - initiate behavioral changes due to the concern induced by the disease  @xcite .",
    "behavioral changes vary from simply avoiding social contact with infected individuals and crowded spaces  @xcite to reducing travel  @xcite and preventing children from attending school . in all cases",
    "we have a modification of the spreading process due to the change of mobility or contact patterns in the population .",
    "in general , these behavioral changes may have a considerable impact on epidemic progression such as the reduction in epidemic size and delay of the epidemic peak . + several studies have been carried out in order to evaluate the impact and role that organized public health measures have in the midst of real epidemics @xcite .",
    "however , only a few recent attempts have considered self - induced behavioral changes individuals adopt during an outbreak in order to reduce the risk of infection . in some approaches",
    "individual behaviors were modeled by modifying contact rates in response to the state of the disease  @xcite . in others new compartments representing individual responses",
    "were proposed  @xcite . finally , in some studies",
    "the spread of information in the presence of the disease was explicitly modeled and coupled with the spreading of the disease itself @xcite . however , we are still without a formulation of a general behavior - disease model .    in this study",
    "we propose a general framework to model the spread of information concerning the epidemic and the eventual behavioral changes in a single population .",
    "the emergent infectious diseases that we consider throughout the manuscript resemble the natural history of an acute respiratory infection with a short duration of infectiousness and have mild impact on the health status of individuals in that healthy status is recovered at the end of the infectious period .",
    "we modify the classic susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model @xcite by introducing a class of individuals , @xmath0 , that represents susceptible people who self - initiate behavioral changes that lead to a reduction in the transmissibility of the infectious disease . in other words ,",
    "this class models the spread of ` fear ' associated with the actual infectious disease spread @xcite . individuals who fear the disease self - initiate social distancing measures that reduce the transmissibility of the disease .",
    "the spread of fear depends on the source and type of information to which individuals are exposed  @xcite .",
    "we classify the general interaction schemes governing the transitions of individuals into and out of @xmath0 by considering behavioral changes due to different information spreading mechanisms , i.e. , belief - based versus prevalence - based and local versus global information spreading mechanisms .",
    "we provide a theoretical and numerical analysis of the various mechanisms involved and uncover a rich phenomenology of the behavior - disease models that includes epidemics with multiple activity peaks and transition points .",
    "we also show that in the presence of belief - based propagation mechanisms the population may acquire a collective ` memory ' of the fear of the disease that makes the population more resilient to future outbreaks .",
    "this abundance of different dynamical behaviors clearly shows the importance of the behavior - disease perspective in the study of realistic progressions of infectious diseases and provides a chart for future studies and scenario analyses in data - driven epidemic models .",
    "in order to describe the infectious disease progression we use the minimal and prototypical sir model . this model is customarily used to describe the progression of acute infectious diseases such as influenza in closed populations where the total number of individuals @xmath1 in the population is partitioned into the compartments @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , denoting the number of susceptible , infected and recovered individuals at time @xmath5 , respectively . by definition",
    "it follows @xmath6 .",
    "the model is described by two simple types of transitions represented in figure  ( [ trans ] ) .",
    "the first one , denoted by @xmath7 , is when a susceptible individual interacts with an infectious individual and acquires infection with transmission rate @xmath8 .",
    "the second one , denoted by @xmath9 , occurs when an infected individual recovers from the disease with rate @xmath10 and is henceforth assumed to have permanent immunity to the disease .",
    "the sir model is therefore described by the two following reactions and the associated rates : @xmath11 @xmath12 while the @xmath9 transition is itself a spontaneous process , the transition from @xmath7 depends on the structure of the population and the contact patterns of individuals .",
    "here we consider the usual homogeneous mixing approximation that assumes that individuals interact randomly among the population . according to this assumption the larger the number of infectious individuals among one individual s contacts the higher the probability of transmission of the infection .",
    "this readily translates in the definition of the force of infection in terms of a mass action law  @xcite , @xmath13 that expresses the per capita rate at which susceptible individuals contract the infection .",
    "in order to simulate the sir model as a stochastic process we can consider a simple binomial model of transition for discrete individuals and discrete times .",
    "each member of the susceptible compartment at time @xmath5 has a probability @xmath14 during the time interval between @xmath5 and @xmath15 to contract the disease and transfer to the infected state at time @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the unitary time scale considered that we have set to @xmath17 in simulations .",
    "as we assume to have @xmath2 independent events occurring with the same probability , the number of newly infected individuals @xmath18 generated during the time interval @xmath16 is a random variable that will follow the binomial distribution @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "analogously , the number of newly recovered individuals @xmath20 at time @xmath15 is a random variable that will obey the binomial distribution @xmath21 $ ] , where the number of independent trials is given by the number of infectious individuals @xmath3 that attempt to recover and the probability of recovery in the time interval @xmath16 is given by the recovery probability @xmath22 . in this processes we recognize that the stochastic variables define a markov chain  @xcite of stochastic events @xmath23 in which the current state of the system is determined only by the state of the system at the previous time steps .",
    "formally , we can indeed write the following markov chain relations : @xmath24 these equations can be readily used to simulate different stochastic realizations of the epidemic events with the same basic parameters and initial conditions .",
    "this allows us to analyze the model s behavior by taking into account statistical fluctuations and noise in the epidemic process .",
    "the equations can also be translated into the standard set of continuous deterministic differential equations describing the sir model by using expected values as @xmath25 the crucial parameter in the analysis of single population epidemic outbreaks is the basic reproductive number @xmath26 , which counts the expected number of secondary infected cases generated by a primary infected individual . under the assumption of homogeneous mixing of the population",
    "the basic reproductive number of the sir model is given by @xmath27 by the simple linearization of the above equations for @xmath28 it is straightforward to see that in the single population case any epidemic will spread to a nonzero fraction of the population only if @xmath29 .",
    "in this case the epidemic is able to generate a number of infected individuals larger than those who recover , leading to an increase in the overall number of infectious individuals @xmath3 .",
    "the previous considerations lead to the definition of a crucial epidemiological concept : the epidemic threshold .",
    "indeed , if the transmission rate is not large enough to allow a reproductive number larger than one ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) , the epidemic outbreak will be confined to a tiny portion of the population and will die out in a finite amount of time in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath31 .    in the following we will use binomial stochastic processes to simulate numerically the progression of the epidemics and we will use the continuum limit to provide the analytical discussion of the models .     schematic representation of the two types of transitions that will be recurrent in the paper .",
    "in panel ( a ) we show the first in which individuals in compartment @xmath32 interact with individuals in class @xmath33 , represented by the small square , becoming @xmath33 themselves . in general the compartment inducing the transition of individuals in @xmath32 could be any other compartment in the model , e.g. @xmath34 , different from the end - point of the transition .",
    "we assume the homogeneous mixing of the population so that the rate at which an individual in @xmath32 interacts with individuals in @xmath33 and changes status is simply given by the product of prevalence @xmath35 of @xmath33 and the transmission rate @xmath8 , @xmath36 .",
    "this type of reaction can be written as @xmath37 . in the case of the sir model @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in panel",
    "( b ) we show the second type .",
    "this is a spontaneous transition with rate @xmath10 in which an individual in compartment @xmath33 spontaneously moves to compartment @xmath40 .",
    "these types of reactions can be written as @xmath41 . in the sir model @xmath39 and @xmath42.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      we need to classify the source and type of information concerning the disease that people use to conduct their behavior in order to model the coupling between behavioral changes and the disease spread . in other words , while the disease spreads in the population , individuals are exposed ( by local contacts , global mass media news , etc . ) to information  @xcite on the disease that will lead to changes in their behavior .",
    "this is equivalent to the coupled spread of two competing contagion processes  @xcite : the infectious disease and the ` fear of the disease ' contagion processes .",
    "the fear of the disease is what induces behavioral changes in the population .",
    "for this reason we will assume that individuals affected by the fear of the disease will be grouped in a specific compartment @xmath0 of susceptible individuals .",
    "these individuals will not be removed from the population , but they will take actions such as reducing the number of potentially infectious contacts , wearing face masks , and other social distancing measures that change disease parameters . in the following we will consider that self - induced behavior changes have the effect of reducing the transmission rate of the infection , introducing the following reaction : @xmath43 with @xmath44 ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) .",
    "the above process corresponds to a force of infection on the individuals affected by the fear contagion @xmath46",
    ". the parameter @xmath47 therefore modulates the level of self - induced behavioral change that leads to the reduction of the transmission rate .",
    "as the scope of the awareness of the disease or of the adopted behavioral changes is avoidance of infection , we assume that individuals in the @xmath48 compartment relax their behavioral changes upon infection and return back to their regular social behavior .",
    "while the above modeling scheme is a straightforward way to include social distancing in the system , a large number of possible scenarios can be considered in the modeling of the contagion process that induce susceptible individuals to adopt self - induced behavioral changes and transition to the state @xmath48 .",
    "in particular we consider three main mechanisms :    * * local , prevalence - based spread of the fear of the disease*. in this scenario we assume that susceptible individuals will adopt behavioral changes only if they interact with infectious individuals .",
    "this implies that the larger the number of sick and infectious individuals among one individual s contacts , the higher the probability for the individual to adopt behavioral changes induced by awareness / fear of the disease .",
    "the fear contagion process therefore can be modeled as @xmath49 where in analogy with the disease spread , @xmath50 is the transmission rate of the awareness / fear of the disease .",
    "this process defines a transition rate for the fear of the disease that can be expressed by the usual mass - action law @xmath51 . *",
    "* global , prevalence - based spread of the fear of the disease*. in some circumstances , individuals adopt self - induced behavioral changes because of information that is publicly available , generally through newspapers , television , and the internet . in this case",
    "the local transmission is superseded by a global mechanism in which the news of a few infected individuals , even if not in contact with the large majority of the population , is able to trigger a widespread reaction in the population . in this case",
    "the fear contagion process is not well represented by the usual mass action law and has to be replaced by @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "figure  ( [ trans3 ] ) shows the schematic representation of this .",
    "+   schematic representation of the third type of interaction discussed . in this case",
    "the transition into compartment @xmath33 is based on the absolute number of the individuals in the compartment ( shown by the small square ) . in general the inducing compartment",

    "* * local , belief - based spread of the fear of the disease*. in addition to the local prevalence - based spread of the fear of the disease , in this case we assume that the fear contagion may also occur by contacting individuals who have already acquired fear / awareness of the disease .",
    "in other words , the larger the number of individuals who have fear / awareness of the disease among one individual s contacts , the higher the probability of that individual adopting behavioral changes and moving into the @xmath48 class .",
    "the fear contagion therefore can also progress according to the following process : @xmath57 where the transmission rate is @xmath58 , with @xmath59 modulating the ratio between the transmission rate by contacting infected individuals and contacting individuals with fear of the disease .",
    "the transition rate is defined by the mass - action law @xmath60 .",
    "the fear / awareness contagion process is not only defined by the spreading of fear from individual to individual , but also by the process defining the transition from the state of fear of the disease back to the regular susceptible state in which the individual relaxes the adopted behavioral changes and returns to regular social behavior .",
    "we can imagine a similar reaction @xmath61 on a very long time scale in which individuals lose memory of the disease independent of their interactions with other individuals and resume their normal social behavior .",
    "this would correspond to spontaneous recovery from fear as proposed by epstein _",
    "however , our social behavior is modified by our local interactions with other individuals on a much more rapidly acting time - scale .",
    "we can therefore consider the following processes : @xmath62 and @xmath63 we can then define two mass - action laws : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
