    "hysteresis occurs in field - driven systems showing history dependence of the corresponding response @xcite .",
    "disorder is acknowledged to be a crucial ingredient in determining hysteresis properties , especially in the so - called rate - independent limit . in this case ,",
    "system properties do no exhibit explicit time dependence . for this to occur ,",
    "two conditions must be satisfied ; ( i ) thermal fluctuations need to be irrelevant ( athermal character ) and ( ii ) field driving rates must be small enough . ideally , this corresponds to the zero - temperature quasi - static limit . within this framework",
    ", disordered systems can be viewed as described by a multidimensional energy landscape containing many local metastable states separated by large energy barriers .",
    "if thermal fluctuations are not operative , these energy barriers can only be overcome by modifying the external field which tilts the energy landscape .",
    "the system evolution thus proceeds through jumps from one metastable state to another metastable state and therefore , the field - response shows a discontinuous and apparent stochastic character . in magnetic systems , this jerky magnetization response corresponds to the so - called barkhausen noise@xcite .",
    "moreover , similar behaviour has been reported in many different systems , including martensitic systems @xcite , superconducting films @xcite and capillary condensation systems @xcite among others .",
    "all these systems exhibit , as a common feature , a field - driven first - order phase transition influenced by disorder . actually , hysteresis has its origin in this first - order transition and the characteristics of the hysteresis loops depend on both the kind and amount of disorder @xcite . with these ideas in mind ,",
    "different versions of lattice spin models with disorder have been proposed as simple models incorporating the essential physics of these systems .",
    "this includes , among other more complicated models , the random field ( rfim ) @xcite , the random bond ( rbim ) @xcite and the site - diluted ( sdim ) @xcite ising models .",
    "such models , with appropriate dynamics , show rate - independent hysteresis and associated barkhausen noise when sweeping the field at very low temperature .",
    "it is also found that the system becomes magnetically softer when the amount of disorder is increased .",
    "this is characterized by a change of the hysteresis loops from sharp to smooth . at the same time",
    ", the distribution of sizes and durations of barkhausen signals is also modified @xcite .",
    "the striking feature is the existence of a specific amount of disorder at which these distributions become critical ( power law behaviour ) .",
    "therefore , the change from sharp to smooth hysteresis loops can be interpreted as a disorder - induced phase transition , as has recently been found experimentally from the study of co / coo films @xcite .",
    "the possible relationship of this phase transition ( involving metastable states ) with a change of the ground state ( equilibrium ) of the system is still an open question .",
    "a number of recent results point , however , in this direction @xcite .    in magnetic materials ,",
    "a physically relevant source of disorder arises from the randomness of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "this paper is aimed at analysing the intrinsic zero - temperature hysteresis and avalanche properties in systems with such disorder .",
    "actually , the random uniaxial single - site anisotropy heisenberg model has been considered to be a suitable model to describe magnetic properties of amorphous alloys @xcite . at mesoscales ,",
    "this model can also be used , as a reasonable approximation , to describe granular materials , alloys with precipitates , polycrystalline systems etc ... , where grains form single magnetic domains , and changes of magnetization can take place only by rotation of the local magnetization vector",
    ". the model was first introduced and studied in the mean field approximation by harris et al .",
    "further investigations suggested that in 3@xmath2 , the stable low - temperature phase is a spin glass phase , even in the limit of strong anisotropy . in this limit , the spins are forced to be aligned along the anisotropy axis and therefore , the model reduces to a random anisotropy ising model ( raim ) @xcite .",
    "this is the model that will be considered in the present study .",
    "to our knowledge , the raim has not been studied very much within the above metastable evolution framework , although it is a good candidate to display a disorder induced phase transition @xcite . moreover ,",
    "it has been argued from symmetry grounds that it should belong to the same universality class as the rfim @xcite",
    ". an interesting feature of this model regards the fact that comparison with experiments may be considered as being more realistic than for other more idealized models such as the rfim or the rbim .",
    "however , modification , in a controlled way , of the amount of disorder in real systems is not always easy to do . for polycrystalline alloys changing the distribution of anisotropy axes",
    "is , in principle , possible by impressing an orientation texture by application of a severe cold work process or by means of a heat treatment ( recrystallization ) @xcite . in the case of magnetostrictive amorphous ribbons",
    ", anisotropy can be controlled by an external applied stress @xcite .",
    "the effect of such external stress is to decrease the amount of disorder by inducing a longitudinal anisotropy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and the details of the numerical simulation procedure . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we present the results , which include the description of the hysteresis loops , the barkhausen avalanches , and critical phenomena .",
    "finally in section [ section4 ] we discuss the results and draw conclusions .",
    "we consider a 3d cubic lattice with spins @xmath3 and local anisotropy axes @xmath4 defined at each site ( @xmath5 . each unitary vector @xmath6 is determined by a pair of spherical polar",
    "coordinates @xmath7 . note that since such unitary vectors define a direction in space , the angles are limited to the ranges @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the axis directions are random and independently distributed according to a generic density probability distribution @xmath10 which is normalized , i.e. : @xmath11 the general hamiltonian of the system can be written as : @xmath12 where the first term with @xmath13 accounts for the ferromagnetic exchange energy , which is short range and is assumed to extend only to nearest - neigbour pairs ( @xmath14 is the coordination number of the cubic lattice ) .",
    "the second term ( zeeman energy ) stands for the interaction with an external applied field @xmath15 .",
    "the third term is the anisotropy energy .",
    "finally , the last term corresponds to the long - range dipolar interactions that extend to all pairs @xmath16 of the lattice .",
    "the vector @xmath17 is the vector joining sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    in the infinite anisotropy limit ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "the spins @xmath21 are constrained to lie on the @xmath22 directions and therefore satisfy : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is now an ising spin variable taking values @xmath25 . under such conditions",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as : @xmath26 the dipolar term represents , in lattice models , a convenient way to describe the magnetostatic energy of the system .",
    "note that it changes from being pure ferromagnetic for a pair of interacting spins with @xmath27 to pure antiferromagnetic when @xmath28 .",
    "the exact treatment of this term in numerical simulations is difficult since the introduction of a cut - off in the interaction range can induce non - physical effects @xcite .",
    "this term has been recently considered within the context of athermal hysteresis studies in the case of perfectly aligned anisotropy axes @xcite .",
    "its main effect on the hysteresis loop is to produce a rather large nucleation jump at the beginning of the demagnetization process . as regards its influence on the properties of the avalanche distributions ,",
    "it has been argued @xcite that its effect is to cause mean - field behaviour .",
    "most of the results in the present work correspond to a situation with rather large randomness .",
    "such randomness and independence of the orientation of the anisotropy axes at two different sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 is expected to weaken the importance of the dipolar term .",
    "therefore , we have not considered it in the present work .",
    "the hamiltonian with @xmath29 reads : @xmath30 where the first term is a random bond term with @xmath31 and the second term describes the random coupling to the external magnetic field ( random g - factor ) with @xmath32 .",
    "the constant term @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) has been omitted , since it represents only a shift in the energy of the system .",
    "moreover , without loss of generality we will take @xmath34 as the unit of energy .    in the present work we will consider that the external field @xmath15 keeps its direction fixed along the @xmath35 axis so that only its magnitude @xmath36 can change",
    ". thus the @xmath37 are constant once the initial distribution of anisotropy axis has been quenched ( notice that rotation of @xmath15 with fixed modulus could also be considered ) .    finally , it should be remarked that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ hamk0 ] ) acts , for each value of @xmath36 , as a random field term .",
    "this equivalence , nevertheless , only applies for equilibrium studies .",
    "the metastable evolution ( hysteresis loops and sequence of avalanches ) of such a random g - factor model can not , a priori , be expected to be equivalent to that of a rfim .      as mentioned in the introduction , in real systems such as polycrystalline alloys ,",
    "the distribution of anisotropy axis is very much dependent on details of the sample preparation .",
    "here we are interested in controlling the amount of disorder in the system by controlling the distribution of angles @xmath38 .",
    "we have considered two simplified models , which represent perturbations of the two extreme cases of a fully aligned anisotropy axis and a completely random distribution ;    * model a + uniform density within a cone @xmath39 : @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 $ ] is the heaviside step function .",
    "note that for @xmath42 the axes are fully aligned in the @xmath35 direction , while for @xmath43 the axes are isotropically distributed .",
    "the amount of disorder in the system increases with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "* model b + first - order correction to the isotropic distribution : @xmath45 in this case the parameter @xmath46 ranges within @xmath47 to ensure that @xmath48 is positive .",
    "for @xmath49 the distribution displays a peak at @xmath50 , which flattens as @xmath46 goes to zero .",
    "thus , in this case , the amount of disorder increases with decreasing @xmath46 . for @xmath51",
    "this distribution is uniform and reduces to model a with @xmath43 .",
    "when @xmath52 the distribution shows a maximum at @xmath53 , which corresponds to a tendency for the anisotropy axes to lie isotropically on a flat disk perpendicular to the external applied field .",
    "thus , strictly speaking when @xmath46 decreases in the @xmath54 region the anisotropy axes orders again , but perpendicular to the external field .",
    "this increases both frustration and competing interactions .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show a number of examples of the anisotropy axis distribution corresponding to models a and b respectively .",
    "the polar plot in the first column corresponds to a particular sample of 1000 anisotropy axes numerically generated according to @xmath38 .",
    "the polar angle in these plots represents @xmath55 while the radius represents @xmath56 .",
    "note that , with this representation , a uniform distribution of anisotropy axes corresponds to a uniform distribution of points on the circle of unit radius .",
    "for each example we show the corresponding distribution of exchange interactions @xmath57 .",
    "moreover if the anisotropy axes are restricted to @xmath58 , the corresponding exchange interactions are all ferromagnetic @xmath59 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath60 in the case of some anisotropy axes then the systems contains a fraction of antiferromagnetic bonds .      regarding the dynamics of the system ,",
    "two different situations have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the first case corresponds to the dynamics of an interface or domain wall propagating in a disordered media @xcite . actually , domain wall motion is the predominant magnetization process in the approximately constant permeability region of the hysteresis loops @xcite , and therefore such dynamics is adequate for studies of the linear region of the magnetization curve .",
    "the second approach is the so - called field - driven nucleation proposed by sethna and co - workers @xcite . in this case",
    "nucleation and growth are treated simultaneously .",
    "while in the former case only spins located at the propagating interface can flip , in the latter , any spin of the system can turn when such a flip becomes energetically favourable .",
    "this second approach seems more convenient for the study of the full hysteresis loops , in particular in systems with strong local anisotropy and a lack of well - defined domain structure    the details of the dynamics used for the numerical simulations are the following ; under slow changes of the external magnetic field , the system follows deterministic dynamics corresponding to local energy relaxation . due to this local character",
    ", the evolution of the system will , in general , not follow an equilibrium path , but rather will evolve through metastable states .",
    "actually , different configurations of spins may correspond to the same value of the external field .",
    "such different configurations are found depending on history conditions .    when studying the full hysteresis loop , the starting point is @xmath61 ( or @xmath62 ) which corresponds to the unique stable configuration with all @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) .",
    "we proceed by decreasing ( or increasing ) the field and compute , from ( [ hamk0 ] ) , the change of energy @xmath65 associated with the independent reversal of any spin @xmath24 .",
    "this change can be written as @xmath66 where the local field @xmath67 acting on lattice site @xmath18 is given by ; @xmath68 the metastable states correspond to those configurations of spins for which @xmath69 .",
    "when for a certain value of @xmath36 one of the spins become unstable ( @xmath70 ) , we keep @xmath36 constant and flip that spin .",
    "this can unstabilize some neighbouring spins ( for which @xmath71 ) which will be simultaneously flipped ( synchronous dynamics ) .",
    "this is the origin of an avalanche .",
    "due to the fact that @xmath72 , when decreasing ( increasing ) the field , the first spin that triggers an avalanche can never yield an increase ( decrease ) of magnetization .",
    "however , such inverse magnetization reversals , may occur during the avalanche .",
    "the procedure continues with @xmath36 constant until all the spins become stable again .",
    "this is the end of the avalanche .",
    "the external field is then decreased ( increased ) until a new spin becomes unstable .",
    "notice that the fact that the field remains constant during the avalanche is the crucial condition for rate - independent hysteresis @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in our numerical simulations we have not observed neverending avalanches which may , in general , occur when using this dynamics in systems with antiferromagnetic bonds .",
    "although we can not provide a rigorous proof for their absence , we suspect that such pathological situations only occur for very special values of the random fields and bonds which have vanishingly small probability when the angles are distributed continuously .",
    "the hysteresis loops are obtained by measuring , as a function of @xmath36 , the total magnetization @xmath73 in the @xmath35-direction defined as ; @xmath74 avalanches are characterized by their duration and size . the duration @xmath75 of the avalanche corresponds to the number of avalanche steps in the algorithm described above .",
    "the avalanche size can be quantified in two different ways :    * the total change of magnetization @xmath76 between the origin and the end of the avalanche ; @xmath77 note that the size of the avalanches , measured in such a way , is bounded by twice the saturation magnetization of the system @xmath78 .",
    "* the total number of spins flipped during the avalanche .",
    "we will denote such a magnitude by @xmath79 . in this case , as opposed to the above definitions , the avalanche size @xmath79 is not bounded by the system size @xmath80 due to the possibility of inverse spin flips .",
    "in this section we present the main results of the numerical simulations .",
    "we have studied 3d systems with periodic boundary conditions and sizes @xmath81,@xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show examples of the hysteresis loops corresponding to models a and b ( system size @xmath84 ) , with different amounts of disorder ( controlled by the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath46 as indicated ) .",
    "first of all , it should be mentioned that the loops are symmetrical with respect to changes @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this property comes directly from the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ hamk0 ] ) .    for both models the qualitative morphological changes of the loops when disorder increases are very similar .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the dependence of the saturation magnetization @xmath87 , the remanent magnetization @xmath88 , the coercive field @xmath89 and the total dissipation ( area within the loop ) @xmath90 on the parameter ( @xmath44 or @xmath46 ) controlling the amount of disorder . in both cases @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath90 decrease with increasing disorder . notice that @xmath87 can be obtained exactly by integration of @xmath91 over all the spatial directions .",
    "the most remarkable difference concerns the behaviour of @xmath89 . in model",
    "a it exhibits a monotonous decrease with increasing disorder . in model b after the initial decrease of @xmath89 with increasing disorder , a minimun is reached ; for negative values of @xmath46 , @xmath89 increases . from these averaged morphological magnitudes apparently",
    "no signs of singular behaviour as a function of the amount of disorder is found .",
    "the detection of a possible disorder - induced critical point needs a detailed study of avalanches which will be presented in the next subsection .",
    "it is illustrative to show a sequence of snapshots of the system configuration during a demagnetization process .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] which corresponds to model a with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "black indicates the lattice sites with reversed spins @xmath64 .",
    "the simulation starts from saturation ( all the @xmath63 ) with a very large applied field .",
    "the different configurations correspond to the same plane ( of the 3d system ) for decreasing values of the external field @xmath94 . during the first stages of the demagnetizing process",
    "the main dynamical mechanism is the nucleation of the reverse magnetization phase by flipping isolated spins .",
    "in contrast , in the middle of the hysteresis loop the evolution takes place by growth ( depinning ) of such domains .",
    "this occurs by means of large avalanches which produce reversals of large fractions of the system .",
    "prior to the analysis of such avalanches it is interesting to consider another feature of the hysteresis loops .",
    "the analysis of partial cycles enables study of the existence of the so - called return point memory ( rpm ) property .",
    "the mathematical conditions for such a property to occur have been discussed for the rfim @xcite , the rbim @xcite and the sdim @xcite .",
    "the two raim models ( a and b ) studied in this work do not exhibit such a property , except for those situations in which no effective antiferromagnetic interactions occur .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows an example of internal loops revealing the failure of the rpm property .",
    "this is due to the existence of reverse spin flips during the avalanches , and even reverse avalanches that occur for large enough amounts of disorder .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such reverse flips represent a small fraction of the total number of flips .",
    "for instance , close to the critical amount of disorder ( defined below ) it represents less than @xmath95 .",
    "the statistical analysis of the avalanches is performed by measuring its size @xmath79 and duration @xmath75 , in a half hysteresis loop .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the probability @xmath96 of occurence of an avalanche of size @xmath79 for model @xmath97 and increasing values of the amount of disorder @xmath44 .",
    "data , represented in log - log plots correspond to the analysis of @xmath98 different half - loops with different realizations of the disorder . for small values of @xmath44 ,",
    "the cycles contain a very large avalanche giving a peak on the right - hand side of the plot and a certain fraction of small avalanches , on the left .",
    "this behaviour is called `` supercritical '' . on the other hand , for large values of @xmath44",
    "the system behaves `` subcritically '' showing only small avalanches .",
    "for an intermediate value @xmath99 , the distribution of avalanches becomes a power - law ( `` critical '' ) characterized by an exponent @xmath100 .",
    "the details of the exponent fitting procedure together with the study of the dependence with the finite size of the system will be presented in the next section .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows the avalanche size distribution @xmath96 for model @xmath101 . in this case",
    "critical behaviour is found at @xmath102 with a power - law exponent @xmath103    it is interesting to consider the following two remarks concerning such avalanche size distributions . on the one hand ,",
    "the avalanche analysis could also be performed by characterizing the avalanche size by @xmath76 , instead of @xmath79 .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows a comparison of the two histograms ( number of avalanches versus size ) @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the case of model a with @xmath92 , @xmath106 and averages over @xmath98 different realizations .",
    "the agreement between both histograms is very good . even in the small avalanche size region",
    "both histograms exhibit almost the same behaviour indicating that effects related to the existence of inverse jumps are totally negligible . therefore , from now on , we will only consider @xmath96 distributions . (",
    "note that in figure [ fig10 ] the histogram @xmath107 has been constructed by taking bins of size @xmath108 .",
    "this is not necessary for @xmath104 since @xmath79 is a discret variable .",
    "thus , for the sake of comparison , the histogram @xmath109 must be displayed after being divided by a factor @xmath110 ) .",
    "on the other hand , it should be mentioned that the large avalanches occuring in the supercritical case span the full simulated system at least in one direction .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] which corresponds to the avalanche distribution of model a with size @xmath92 and @xmath111 . for this amount of disorder",
    "the system still behaves slightly supercritically .",
    "the three histograms correspond to the distribution of all the avalanches ( bottom ) , the non - spanning avalanches ( middle ) and the spanning ones ( top ) .",
    "the inset shows the histogram of spanning avalanches on a linear scale , revealing the existence of a characteristic size , which increases when disorder decreases and system size increases .",
    "actually , in the thermodynamic limit such spanning avalanches will be infinite , involving a macroscopic fraction of the the system and giving rise to magnetization discontinuities in the hysteresis loop .",
    "it is worth noting that in previous studies of the same problem in the rfim @xcite such spanning avalanches were substracted from the histograms for the analysis of the critical behaviour . in the present work we have decided to keep them since ,",
    "as will be seen , their occurence provides a criteria for locating the critical point .",
    "the power - law behaviour of the avalanche size distributions reveals the existence of criticality in the system .",
    "for this reason such transitions related to the change of properties of the hysteresis loop and of the barkhausen noise distribution when disorder is increased are called disorder - induced critical points .",
    "they share many similarities with the classical critical points , but one should never forget that a number of features are different ; firstly we are dealing with a history - dependent metastable evolution of the system , i.e. an out - of - equilibrium problem , thus many thermodynamical equations relating critical exponents , may not be valid @xcite . at this point",
    "it should be mentioned that for the rfim , for which the exact equilibrium trajectories can be obtained , it has been found numerically that a transition point exists for the same amounts of disorder in equilibrium .",
    "a second remark concerns the fact that we are dealing with a deterministic phenomenon at @xmath0 and thus fluctuations ( in the standard sense ) , do not exist . by studying systems with different realizations of the disorder corresponding to the same probability distribution @xmath38",
    ", one can define average values of any generic property @xmath35 that we will denote as @xmath112 .",
    "we can also define `` fluctuations '' as @xmath113 , but the extrapolation of these averages to the thermodynamic limit may hide some mathematical inconsistencies .    the consequences arising from the two remarks above are still not totally understood .",
    "for instance , for such disorder - induced critical points it is not clear what the order parameter is .",
    "one choice is the system magnetization per site @xmath114 .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the system displays hysteresis for both @xmath115 and @xmath116 implies that @xmath117 does not go to zero at the critical point .",
    "for the rfim , sethna and coworkers @xcite use @xmath118 ( where @xmath119 is the value of the magnetization at the critical point ) .",
    "besides the fact that this quantity does not remain equal to zero above the critical point , it adds to the problem of determining @xmath119 . a second choice , which was originally used for the study of the rbim @xcite , is to measure the size @xmath120 of the largest avalanche in the hysteresis loop .",
    "clearly this is a quantitiy that for a finite system is not a suitable order parameter since it never goes to zero .",
    "however , for the infinite system , @xmath121 will be zero for any degree of disorder except for those for which an avalanche spanning a macroscopic portion of the system occurs .",
    "this leads to the existence of a discontinuity in the hysteresis loop .",
    "thus , in the present paper , we have chosen this quantity as the order parameter .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] displays the behaviour of @xmath122 as a function of @xmath44 for different system sizes .",
    "data corresponds to averages over @xmath123 and @xmath98 different realizations of the disorder for @xmath124 and @xmath125 respectively .",
    "the ( pseudo- ) phase transition for the finite system will correspond to the inflection point of such curves .",
    "the exact location of @xmath126 can be obtained , for instance , by means of a 4rth - order polynomial fitting of the inflection point or , after a numerical derivative , a 2nd - order polynomial fitting of the maximum .",
    "this gives two slightly different estimations of the the critical point .",
    "an independent way of locating the phase transition is to measure the duration @xmath127 of the longest avalanche in the half hysteresis loop . the average of such a quantity @xmath128 is also shown in fig . [ fig12 ] as a function of @xmath44 for different system sizes ( @xmath127 is normalized by @xmath129 since this is the minimum number of steps needed in order to cover the full system ) .",
    "this quantity displays a maximum at @xmath126 which is also fitted by using a 2nd - order polynomial .",
    "figure [ fig12b ] shows equivalent data to that of figure [ fig12 ] for model b. in this case only systems up to @xmath130 have been studied .",
    "the simulation of larger systems in this case is much more time consuming than for model a due to the wider distribution of anisotropy axes .    a fourth method for the location of the critical point results from the quantitative analysis of the avalanche size distribution of figs . [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] .",
    "these distributions correspond to the statistical analysis of all the avalanches occuring in full half - loops for many realizations of disorder . in general",
    "they are well fitted by an exponentially corrected power - law probability distribution @xcite ; @xmath131 where @xmath97 is not an extra free parameter but the normalization factor . as mentioned before the avalanche size @xmath79 takes discrete values and , strictly speaking , is not bounded from above due to the possibility of inverse flips .",
    "for the computation of the normalization factor @xmath97 we have chosen the largest value @xmath132 of each set of data , which in all cases has been found to be lower than @xmath80 .",
    "thus @xmath97 ( which is a function of @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) is given by : @xmath135 the fits are performed by the maximum likelihood method , which is independent of any binning process or representation .",
    "examples of the fits are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . as a general comment",
    ", it should be mentioned that the fits are very good for the subcritical , critical and slightly supercritical distributions . for the deep supercritical distributions",
    "they are not that good due to two different problems ; ( i ) the existence of large avalanches which span an important fraction of the system makes it difficult to have enough statistics and ( ii ) the fact that the proposed model ( eq . [ powexp ] ) is not well suited to describe the occurence of the peak ( with a certain characteristic size ) in the large @xmath79 regions .    for model",
    "a the values obtained of @xmath134 and @xmath133 as a function of @xmath44 are shown in fig .",

    "the estimation of @xmath126 can be obtained by interpolating the value of @xmath44 for which @xmath141 .",

    "the same kind of analysis can be performed with the corresponding similar results for model b. they are shown in fig .",

    "the obtained value is @xmath160    once @xmath155 and @xmath153 are determined , the exponents @xmath152 and @xmath35 can be obtained by analyzing the change with @xmath129 of the height and slope at the inflection point in the curve @xmath161 and the height and curvature at the maximum in @xmath162 . from linear fits to log - log plots the following estimations are obtained : @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",

    "the avalanche size distributions analyzed in the previous sections , corresponds to the study of the whole hysteresis cycle .",

    "the power - law distribution of avalanche sizes is characterized by an exponent @xmath170 which for the rfim takes a value @xmath171 and is related to @xmath133 through a certain scaling relation @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath96 at @xmath172 is quite difficult since to obtain sufficiently accurate statistics for a given value of @xmath36 requires a large number of realizations of disorder .",

    "the figure reveals the existence of a critical region with @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "it is worth noting that outside this critical region , the fit of eq . [ powexp ] renders values of @xmath170 well below the critical value .",
    "this method of determining @xmath169 is very approximate , since the need for large enough statistics requires a large field window that introduces considerable bias .    finally , it is interesting to compare @xmath89 with the value of the field @xmath178 at which the largest avalanche ( @xmath132 ) for a demagnetizing process ( from positive @xmath36 to negative @xmath36 ) occurs .",
    "experimentally , in the region of large disorder @xmath178 can be determined by locating the field for which the macroscopic hysteresis loop exhibits maximum slope , i.e. maximum susceptibility .",

    "as expected , for low values of disorder both @xmath178 and @xmath89 coincide ; the largest avalanche associated with the magnetization reversal crosses the line @xmath181 and , thus , determines @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast , for large amounts of disorder the largest avalanche in the hysteresis loop occurs for a value of the field more negative than @xmath89 .",
    "the inset in figure [ fig18 ] shows the actual distribution of @xmath178 and @xmath89 over different realizations of disorder and @xmath84 .",
    "note that both distributions are quite gaussian and that for large disorder are split in such a way that the distribution of @xmath89 remains rather sharp while the distribution of @xmath178 broadens . whether or not the coincidence of @xmath89 and @xmath178 determines the critical field is a question that can not be definitively answered from our results .",
    "in this section we compare our results with those corresponding to other models and experiments reported in the litterature .    in the present raim ,",
    "hysteresis arises from energy barriers separating metastable states which have their origin in the effective coupling between spins .",
    "this effective coupling is modified by changes in the distribution of anisotropy axes , but even in the absence of disorder , ( corresponding to the zero - temperature standard ising model ) hysteresis occurs . in magnetism , hysteresis can be interpreted within the framework of the stoner - wohlfarth model ( swm)@xcite . this model gives an essentially different description of hysteresis than that proposed in this paper . for the swm ,",
    "independent single magnetic domains with continuously orientable magnetic moments are considered .",
    "these single domains can be identified with the spins in the present model .",
    "hysteresis , in the swm , arises from energy barriers originating from the competion between uniaxial anisotropy and zeeman energy .",
    "actually , no hysteresis occurs in the sw model in the infinite anisotropy limit .",
    "the morphological properties of the hysteresis loops depend , as expected , on the specific characteristics of the disorder .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results given in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for coercivity and dissipated energy with available experimental results .",
    "experiments carried out on ribbons of high magnetostrictive amorphous alloys under stress @xcite are especially interesting .",
    "they reveal that the applied stress favours global ( long - range ) uniaxial anisotropy which manifests itself by a change of the magnetic domain pattern @xcite .",
    "consequently , this leads to a change of the shape of the hysteresis loops . at low external stress , a complicated pattern constituted by maze domains results from the effect of quenched - in stresses .",
    "as the external stress is increased , a simpler domain pattern appears with few parallel domains in the direction of the external stress .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to assume that the effect of the stress is to reduce the randomness of the local anisotropy axes , or in other words to reduce disorder .",
    "the main experimental result @xcite , is that with increasing external stress , @xmath89 initially exhibits a fast decrease down to a certain minimum value , followed by a roughly linear increase at high stresses .",
    "actually , this effect is reproduced by our model b as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) . this could be explained by taking the competition phenomena arising in the @xmath54 region for model b mentioned in section [ modeling ] into account .",
    "more quantitative comparisons , nevertheless , are not possible since the actual anisotropy axis distribution in ribbons is difficult to compare with our 3d system .",
    "as regards @xmath90 , experimentally it is found that it shows a behaviour similar to that of @xmath89 @xcite , that is , it exhibits a minimum for a certain value of the applied stress .",
    "this is not reproduced either by our models a or b , which show simply a monotonous increase when the system becomes more and more ordered .",
    "this disagreement could be due to the fact that in the models , @xmath87 depends on the degree of disorder , as a consequence of the strong anisotropy assumption .",
    "experimentally this is not the case and @xmath87 is almost constant for a given sample composition and thus one expects that @xmath182 .",
    "as regards the critical point our results are totally compatible with the universality that has been proposed for similar athermal models .",
    "table [ table1 ] compares the values obtained in the present work for models a and b with those reported in the literature for the 3d random field ising model , 3d random bond ising model and 3d site - diluted ising model .",
    "the agreement is very satisfactory confirming universality @xcite .",
    "table [ table1 ] also includes the values of the exponents corresponding to mean - field calculations .",
    "clearly , when considering the full set of all the critical exponents , one concludes that the mean - field model does not belong to the same universality class .",
    "this is not surprising since the mean - field approximation assumes long - range interactions while the other models are strictly short range .",
    "the mean - field exponent values are expected to be found in systems including dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it should be remarked that the exponents @xmath170 and @xmath133 seem to have , within the errors , comparable values for the two universality classes .",
    "therefore , the analysis of the models suggests that the statistical distribution of avalanches shows very close critical exponents , irrespective of the inclusion or not of the dipolar forces .",
    "it is , perhaps , more interesting to compare such theoretical exponents with those found experimentally .",
    "the direct comparison of the numerical values should always be taken carefully since , in experiments , avalanche sizes are determined in different ways depending on the specific measurement technique used .",
    "table [ table2 ] summarizes the most significant values of the exponents reported from the experimental study of barkhausen noise in magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "we have separated the @xmath170 exponents corresponding to measurements of noise around a certain value of the external field from the @xmath133 exponents corresponding to the analysis of the signal sequence during the full hysteresis loop ( or half loop ) . in both cases ,",
    "the numerical procedure for obtaining such experimental exponents is similar to that followed for the analysis of the model simulations ; it is based on fitting an expression like eq .",
    "( [ powexp ] ) to the recorded histograms of avalanche sizes .",
    "a first remark is that the overall situation concerning the possibility for universality in experiments is not as clear as it is for the theoretical models . in our opinion",
    "the main problem is to determine whether the analyzed data corresponds to a critical system or not .",
    "a second remark is that the values reported in table [ table2 ] seem to show a certain dependence on heat treatments and other effects influencing the degree of quenched disorder in the system .",
    "for instance , in references @xcite and @xcite it is found that the @xmath133 exponent increases towards a value close to @xmath183 when the degree of order in the sample is increased by annealing and/or magnetic field cooling .",
    "furthermore the distribution of avalanche sizes in fe - co - b alloys ( characterized by an exponent @xmath184 @xcite ) were found to change from subcritical towards critical ( the cutoff , equivalent to our @xmath185 , increases ) when the applied tensile stress is increased @xcite . in agreement with these results ,",
    "the @xmath133 exponents in our simulations show a clear increase when the degree of disorder is decreased as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and [ fig13b ] .",
    "moreover , our results also suggest that provided that the measurements are performed in the subcritical region , the estimated value of @xmath133 will remain close to the critical value .",
    "this could explain why the values of @xmath133 in table [ table2 ] are quite similar to those found for the models .",
    "actually , the possible existence of a large critical region has also been suggested for the rfim @xcite and for the site diluted random field ising model ( rfim with vacancies ) @xcite . for this last model",
    "it has even been proposed that true criticality extends over a broad region of parameters controlling disorder .",
    "a third remark concerns certain procedures used for the estimation of @xmath170 and @xmath133 . for instance , for the determination of @xmath133 , in some cases saturation is not reached in the studied hysteresis loops .",
    "this means that the distributions correspond , in fact , to an internal loop .",
    "true saturation requires very high fields which can be not experimentally accessible . at present , it is not clear what the consequences on the measured @xmath133 exponent will be .",
    "for the determination of @xmath170 , the experiments are carried out with an external field constrained around the coercive field .",
    "our simulations suggest that this may introduce a bias in the estimated exponents .",
    "first , if the amount of disorder is greater than the critical amount of disorder , the field at which the largest avalanche takes place and the coercive field do not coincide , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] .",
    "moreover , even in the case that the disorder is close to the critical value , a deviation in the tuning of the external field would lead to lower values of @xmath170 compared to those expected at @xmath186 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "this may provide an explanation for some of the low values of @xmath170 reported recently @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have studied rate - independent hysteresis properties of a random anisotropy reticular model . we have considered the infinite uniaxial anisotropy limit and we have neglected any effects of dipolar interactions . in this",
    "limit the model reduces to the random anisotropy ising model which can be viewed as a combination of a random bond ising model with random couplings ( g - factors ) to the external magnetic field .",
    "this model seems rather appropriate to realistically describe amorphous and polycrystalline magnetic materials .",
    "disorder is introduced in the system through the spatial random distribution of anisotropy axis .",
    "two different distributions , in which disorder is controlled by a single parameter ( @xmath44 and @xmath46 ) , have been considered .",
    "extensive numerical simulations of the model have been performed by means of a deterministic algorithm consisting in of synchronous local relaxation dynamics .",
    "the morphological properties of the hysteresis loops have been obtained .",
    "they depend on the specific distribution of disorder but do not show any singular behaviour when @xmath44 or @xmath46 are varied .",
    "qualitative agreement with some available experimental data has been found .",
    "we expect that by choosing a suitable phenomenological distribution of disorder such morphological properties could be better reproduced .",
    "besides , we have focused on the analysis of the barkhausen avalanches generated during the metastable evolution .",
    "the statistical distribution of such avalanches shows a critical behaviour for a certain amount of disorder ( @xmath187 and @xmath188 ) . from a finite - size scaling analysis of different simulated properties",
    "we have obtained the critical exponents characterizing the disorder - induced critical point .",
    "the most important conclusion is that the present model falls in the same universality class of the athermal 3d rfim .",
    "we have also analyzed the different available experimental values of such critical exponents characterizing the distribution of barkhausen signals .",
    "data is scarce and refer to different exponents ( @xmath170 and @xmath133 ) .",
    "although there are some discrepancies , the comparison indicates that the experimental systems may fall into the same universality class .",
    "however , results suggest that it is necessary to tune the disorder in the systems with adequate thermomechanical treatments so that the system behaves critically .",
    "although a systematic control of the amount of disorder is experimentally difficult , the analysis of our model indicates the best conditions for such measurements and data analysis ; ( i ) disregarding additional experimental problems @xcite , it is more reliable to measure @xmath133 ( full hysteresis loop analysis ) instead of @xmath170 in order to avoid problems related to the determination of the critical field @xmath172 ; ( ii ) although the samples exhibit an exponentially damped power - law distribution ( subcritical ) , the @xmath133 exponents obtained by fitting eq .",
