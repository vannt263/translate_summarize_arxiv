    "a perfect matching is a graph where each vertex has degree one , and a partition graph is a graph that is a disjoint union of monotone paths , that is , where each vertex has at most one edge to its right and at most one to its left .",

    "then we discuss why , from the perspective of pattern avoiding , graphs and fillings of diagrams are equivalent objects . in particular , showing that the number of @xmath0-noncrossing graphs with a fixed degree sequence equals the number of such @xmath0-nonnesting graphs is equivalent to proving a result on fillings of diagrams with restrictions on the row and column sums .",

    "we say that the filling _ avoids @xmath23 _ if there is no such selection of rows and columns .",
    "if a filling @xmath21 contains @xmath23 , by an _ occurrence _ of @xmath23 we mean the set of cells of @xmath20 that correspond to the @xmath31 s in @xmath23 .",
    "we are mainly concerned about diagrams avoiding the identity matrix @xmath32 and the antiidentity matrix @xmath33 ; the latter is the matrix with @xmath31 s in the main antidiagonal and @xmath22 s elsewhere .",

    "we explore two types of connections between graphs and fillings of diagrams .",
    "the first one is straightforward , being essentially the adjacency matrix , and it has been used in  @xcite to derive results on @xmath0-noncrossing maximal graphs and @xmath0-noncrossing and @xmath0-nonnesting matchings and partitions .",

    "let this filling of the diagram be called @xmath47 .",
    "obviously the sum of the entries of @xmath47 is the number of edges of @xmath2 and the number of vertices is just one plus the number of rows of @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath2 is a simple graph , then @xmath47 is a @xmath25 filling .",

    "we believe that our correspondence between graphs and fillings of diagrams also belongs to this picture and that it may shed some light in the understanding of it .",
    "we have shown that for each statement in pattern avoiding fillings there is a statement about graphs avoiding certain split graphs .",
    "so we can claim that in some sense the resources available to attack either problem have doubled .",

    "even if our main question has been answered positively , it is fair to say that it has not been solved in the most satisfactory way ; ideally we would like to find a bijective proof in graph theoretic terms .",
    "note that due to its roundabout character , our proof of theorem  [ thm : avoidk ] does not give a clear bijection , neither in terms of graphs nor of fillings .",
    "also the proofs of corollaries  [ cor : kcrossknestmulti ] , [ cor : simple ] , and  [ cor : simplemax ] do not provide bijections in graph theoretic terms . a bijective proof of theorem  [ thm : kcrossknest ] for @xmath300",

    "this is already known for matchings and partition graphs  @xcite .",
    "one would also hope for a wide generalization of theorem  [ thm : kcrossknest ] stating that the number of graphs with @xmath302 @xmath0-crossings and @xmath81 @xmath0-nestings equals the number of graphs with @xmath81 @xmath0-crossings and @xmath302 @xmath0-nestings .",
