    "the exclusive decay @xmath7 has been previously analyzed using a partial reconstruction technique  @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "the @xmath5 is identified without reconstructing the @xmath8 meson , and the presence of an undetected neutrino is inferred by conservation of momentum and energy .",
    "this approach is possible due to the extremely low decay energy of this mode .",
    "the soft @xmath9 carries sufficient information to determine an approximate four - momentum of the @xmath5 meson .",
    "the partial reconstruction technique may result in a gain of as much as a factor of 10 in statistics compared to the full reconstruction technique , though the effective gain may be less due to background .",
    "this study can improve the understanding of the branching fraction of all @xmath2 decays measurements , including studies of cp violation and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix element , @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , this study can be a significant contribution to enhance our knowledge of isospin violation in @xmath1 decay .",
    "the isospin violation is due to the mass difference of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks and due to electromagnetic interactions .",
    "all currently published branching fraction measurements based on an admixture of @xmath2 mesons at the @xmath1 assume that @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "all measurements of fundamental parameters at the @xmath1 are limited by the uncertainty on the ratio of the branching fraction of @xmath14 to the branching fraction of @xmath3 defined as @xmath15 .",
    "the current measurements of @xmath16 are limited its ratio within an uncertainty of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "its values depend on the ratio of the charged and neutral @xmath2 meson lifetime as well as the assumption of isospin symmetry .",
    "the @xmath2 meson velocity in the @xmath1 rest frame is relatively small .",
    "thus @xmath18v@xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the masses of the @xmath2 meson and the @xmath1 resonance , respectively .",
    "since the final state @xmath2 mesons are non - relativistic and have low momentum , it was suggested that the final state interactions of the @xmath2 meson can be treated using non - relativistic field theory combined with chiral perturbation theory .",
    "one can also calculate the dominant coulomb correction using non - relativistic time - dependent perturbation theory .",
    "the current theoretical predictions of @xmath23 has a variation effect and its ratio range from 1.03 to 1.25  @xcite : @xmath24    the exclusive decay of @xmath25 has the largest branching fraction of any exclusive @xmath2 decay and a relatively simple theoretical interpretation .",
    "figure  [ fig : fm_plot ] shows the spectator quark - level feynman diagram , where the heavy @xmath26 quark decays to either a @xmath27 or @xmath11 quark and a lepton pair created from the virtual @xmath28 boson .",
    "the flavor of the @xmath2 meson can be indicated from the charge of the lepton .",
    "more precisely , a positively charged lepton indicates a @xmath2 meson with a @xmath29 quark , whereas a negatively charged lepton indicates a @xmath30 meson with a @xmath26 quark .",
    "decays.,height=170 ]    the main focus of this paper is to describe the procedure used in determining the absolute branching fraction of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , with partial reconstruction of @xmath33 .",

    "production in @xmath36 collisions.,height=147 ]",
    "the data used in this paper were collected with the babar detector at the pep - ii asymmetric - energy @xmath2 factory at slac .",
    "the argus  @xcite and ua1  @xcite discovery of @xmath37 mixing , made possible by the surprisingly massive top quark  @xcite , provided @xmath37 decays that could interfere .",
    "plans were soon begun to construct an asymmetric b factory based on pep to search for cp violation  @xcite . this has now led to a data sample of 81.7 fb@xmath0 at the @xmath1 resonance ( on - resonance ) and 9.6 fb@xmath0 below the resonance ( off - resonance ) .",
    "the total number of the simulated generic monte carlo ( mc ) for @xmath34 and @xmath38 events are equivalent to about 160 fb@xmath0 for each pair .",
    "hadronic events are selected by requiring at least four tracks from charged hadrons reconstructed by the silicon vertex detector ( svt )  @xcite and the drift chamber ( dch )  @xcite .",
    "this selection helps to remove bhabha and muon pair events .",
    "all lepton candidates ( electrons and muons ) are required to have momenta between 1.5  gev/@xmath27 and 2.3  gev/@xmath27 to suppress the leptons from the other charm decays .",
    "soft pion candidates were selected among all the charged particles with momenta between 60  mev/@xmath27 and 200  mev/@xmath27 .",
    "electrons are identified by exploiting information from the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc )  @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath39 is used to provide a good discrimination between electrons and other charged particles species .",
    "@xmath40 is the measured energy of a shower in the calorimeter and @xmath41 is the measured momentum of the corresponding charged track .",
    "the efficiency for electrons in the acceptance of the electromagnetic calorimeter is @xmath42 , with a hadron mis - identification probability of less than @xmath43 .",
    "we also require the measurements of the specific ionization ( @xmath44 ) from the drift chamber as well as an information from the detection of internally reflected cherenkov ring imaging detector ( dirc )  @xcite .",
    "muons are identified in the instrumented flux return ( ifr )  @xcite .",
    "we use a `` tight muon '' selection which provided an efficiency of about @xmath45 with a hadron mis - identification probability about @xmath46 .",
    "kaons are rejected using information from the cherenkov light emission in the dirc by requiring the consistency with the kaon hypothesis to be smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "more details of the babar detector are described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "to partially reconstruct @xmath48 , lepton candidates are combined with soft charged pions from the decay @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 is just massive enough to create a @xmath51 meson and a soft pion .",
    "these two daughters therefore have very little momentum in the @xmath50 rest frame .",
    "this pion is often referred to as the `` soft pion , '' and its direction coincides approximately with the direction of the parent @xmath50 .",
    "this condition allows us to do an approximation of the @xmath50 four - vector by measuring only the pion four - vector momentum , without the @xmath51 meson reconstruction .",
    "the approximate four - momentum of the @xmath50 , ( @xmath52 ) , is calculated by scaling the soft pion momentum : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the pion energy , @xmath55  mev is the energy of the pion in the @xmath56 center of mass frame , and @xmath57  gev/@xmath58 is the mass of the @xmath56 .    since the @xmath2 meson has a very small momentum , one may use an approximation for the missing mass squared ( @xmath59 ) with @xmath60 : @xmath61 the @xmath59 distribution will peak near zero if the decay has been properly reconstructed and the neutrino is the only missing particle .",
    "the single tag events are referred at least one neutral @xmath2 partially reconstructed through the exclusive decays @xmath62 .",
    "the total signal yield of these events is denoted as @xmath63 .",
    "the double tag events are referred to two neutral @xmath2 partially reconstructed in the same decay channel as above .",
    "these events are obtained by reconstructing the other @xmath2 mesons within the single tag events .",
    "its total signal yield is denoted as @xmath64 .",
    "the total numbers of the single tag and the double tag reconstructed signal events , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , have the following relationships to the branching fractions respectively : @xmath65 @xmath66^{2 } \\label{eq : ndouble}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the fraction of neutral @xmath2 mesons in @xmath1 events , and @xmath67 is the reconstruction efficiency for the respective @xmath68 modes .    combining these yields , one solves for @xmath32 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the total numbers of @xmath71 events .",
    "this study has several advantages both over the measurements with fully reconstructed @xmath2 mesons and the measurements of the ratio of charged to neutral production of @xmath2 mesons at the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "first , a lower systematic error may be obtained since this method is independent of the branching fraction on the @xmath56 decays with its large uncertainty .",
    "secondly , by combining it with another direct measurement of @xmath72 this method could address the question of additional substantial @xmath1 decay modes  @xcite .",
    "the continuum background events are non - resonant decays of @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "these backgrounds are generally collimated into two back - to - back jets events while events are much more isotropic in the @xmath1 rest frame . to reduce the continuum background events ,",
    "the ratio @xmath75 of fox - wolfram moments has been used  @xcite .",
    "this variable can take values between 0 and 1 , and tends toward higher values for jet - like events and lower values for events with isotropic distributions of final state particles . by requiring @xmath76",
    ", we retain nearly all @xmath77 events while reducing the contribution from @xmath78 continuum by approximately 50% .",
    "the contribution from the continuum background events are estimated by analyzing the off - resonance data and scaling the result to correct for differences in the integrated luminosity and center of mass energy .",
    "the average continuum scaling factor , @xmath79 , is @xmath80    the combinatoric background , also known as uncorrelated background , for single tag events is defined as a random combination of real leptons from @xmath2 decays that are paired with right sign soft pions that come from the other @xmath2 .",
    "this background can also be due to the low momentum soft pions not necessarily coming from a @xmath56 , produced by either the same or other @xmath2 .",
    "the combinatoric background events are estimated using monte carlo data simulation ( mc ) .",
    "its normalization is obtained by fitting the monte carlo simulation to the data in the sideband region , @xmath81gev@xmath82 .",
    "the overall @xmath83 distribution of the combinatoric background is dominated by phase space , i.e. , a hard lepton and soft pion distributed isotropically will produce a distribution similar to signal events .",
    "a simple overall test of its reliability is the counting of the wrong sign ( @xmath84 ) candidates , where no signal is expected as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wrongsign ] .     for the wrong - sign @xmath85 candidates .",
    "the plot shows data on resonance ( dotted ) , monte carlo normalized to data in the sideband region ( solid histogram ) and the scaled continuum background ( hatched ) .",
    "note : the scaled continuum background has been subtracted from the data.,width=453,height=604 ]    the correlated background is obtained from the right sign combination of leptons with soft pions either from the same or different @xmath2 , however , the soft pions come from @xmath86 . the relatively high momentum cut of 1.5  gev/@xmath27 on the leptons is chosen to reduce the contribution of the correlated background , which is believed to be small but it is otherwise difficult to separate them kinematically from the tag signal events in @xmath87 distribution . the single tag and double tag events accumulate in the signal region , @xmath88gev@xmath82 , as shown in fig .",

    "however , only the modes with @xmath5 could contribute to @xmath83 .",
    "these modes has been extensively studied by the argus , cleo and babar collaborations  @xcite .",
    "after all background subtractions described above , the total signal yield for the single tag and double tag events are extracted by counting ( @xmath93 ) candidates which fall in the signal region , @xmath94gev@xmath95 .",
