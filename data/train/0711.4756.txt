    "many new states have been recently observed in the open and hidden charm sector : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , together with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath2 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .... @xcite .",
    "the need for theoretical interpretation of this states comes not only from the request of organizing the particle `` zoology '' , but also from the interesting possibility of identifying new `` exotic '' structures .",
    "this is what we would like to briefly discuss in the next section devoted to the @xmath13 sector , with particular attention to the @xmath0 and a few words on @xmath1 , and in the third section devoted to the hidden charm sector and , in particular , to the interpretation of @xmath2 .",
    "the classification of the @xmath13 states is easier in the heavy - quark limit @xmath15 . in this limit",
    "the spin @xmath16 of the heavy quark and the angular momentum @xmath17 of the light degrees of freedom : @xmath18 ( @xmath19 light antiquark spin , @xmath20 orbital angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom relative to the heavy quark ) are decoupled , and the spin - parity @xmath21 is conserved in strong interactions @xcite .",
    "this makes possible to classify mesons into doublets labeled by @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the parity ) , each containing a couple of meson of spin - parity @xmath23 and degenerate in mass .",
    "mass differences between members of the same doublet are of order @xmath24 .",
    "the standard classification of known @xmath13 states in this scheme is given in table  [ organiz ] @xcite .",
    "the states labeled by @xmath25 and @xmath26 are still to be discovered ; we discuss here a possible identification of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "[ organiz ]    .@xmath29 states organized according to @xmath21 and @xmath30 .",
    "the mass of known mesons is indicated . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these ratios can be used to exclude some assignments . indeed , since a @xmath31 signal has not been observed in the @xmath0 mass range , the production of @xmath32 is not favoured and therefore @xmath0 is not a radial excitation of @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the assignment @xmath35 , @xmath36 can also be excluded : the width @xmath37 obtained using ( [ lag - hprimo ] ) would be too big using @xmath38 @xcite , and there is no reason to presume that the coupling constant @xmath39 is sensibly smaller .    in the case of the assignment @xmath40 , @xmath41 , proposed in @xcite ,",
    "the decay @xmath42 is forbidden and the transition into @xmath43 occurs in @xmath44wave .",
    "the coupling costant for the lowest radial quantum number is @xmath45 @xcite ; using this value for @xmath46 we would obtain @xmath47 gev .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that @xmath48 . a large signal in the @xmath49 channel",
    "would also be expected .",
    "a problem is that , if @xmath0 is a @xmath50 radial excitation , its partner with @xmath51 would decay to @xmath32 with a width of the order of 40 mev .",
    "since both the lowest lying states with @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath4 , are produced in charm continuum at @xmath55 factories , one must invoke an exotic mechanism to explain the absence of the @xmath31 signal at energy around @xmath56 mev .    in the last case @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath58 the narrow @xmath43 width is due to the kaon momentum suppression : @xmath59",
    ". a smaller but non negligible signal in the @xmath31 mode is predicted , and a small signal in the @xmath49 mode is also expected .",
    "moreover , a fact that supports this assignment is that @xmath0 with @xmath58 is not expected to be produced in non leptonic @xmath55 decays such as @xmath60 and @xmath61 and indeed in the dalitz plot analysis of @xmath62 belle found no signal of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of our study is that @xmath0 is likely a @xmath58 state , a predicted high mass , high spin and relatively narrow @xmath29 state @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by a recent lattice qcd analysis @xcite .",
    "its non - strange partner @xmath63 , if the mass splitting @xmath64 is of the order of the strange quark mass , is also expected to be narrow : @xmath65 mev .",
    "it can be produced in semileptonic and in non leptonic @xmath55 decays , such as @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite : its observation could be used to confirm the quantum number assignment to the resonance @xmath0 found by babar .",
    "an analogous study for @xmath1 ( @xmath36 ) @xcite discussing how to distinguish between the two possible quantum number assignments @xmath68 or @xmath69 @xcite , shows that the ratio @xmath70 is different in the two scenarios and so it may be useful to understand the right identification .",
    "other investigations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 involving potential models can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting mesons in the hidden charm sector is the @xmath2 , discovered in the @xmath71 invariant mass distribution in @xmath55 decays and in @xmath72 collisions @xcite , with @xmath73 mev and @xmath74 mev ( @xmath75 c.l . )",
    "the @xmath76 spectrum is peaked for large invariant mass @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 was not observed in @xmath77 annihilation and in @xmath78 fusion , and there is also no evidence of the existence of charged partners .",
    "the observation of the @xmath79 mode @xcite indicates that the charge conjugation of the state is c=+1 ; angular distribution studies show that the most likely quantum number assignment is @xmath80 @xcite .    since another hadronic decay mode was observed for @xmath2 : @xmath81 with @xmath82 @xcite , there are g - parity violating @xmath83 transitions : this suggested the conjecture that @xmath2 is not a charmonium @xmath84 state .",
    "indeed , the coincidence between the @xmath83 mass as averaged by pdg and the @xmath85 mass inspired the proposal that @xmath2 could be a molecular quarkonium @xcite , a @xmath86 and @xmath87 bound state with small binding energy due to a single pion exchange @xcite .",
    "such an interpretation would allow to account for a few properties of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , describing the wave function of @xmath2 through various hadronic components @xcite : @xmath88 ( with @xmath89 ) one could explain why this state seems not to have definite isospin , why the mode @xmath90 was not found , and why , if the molecular binding mechanism is truly provided by a single pion exchange ( however , this is a controversial point ) , there are no @xmath91 molecular states . anyway , concerning the large value of the ratio @xmath92 one has to consider that phase space effects in two and three pion modes are very different .",
    "the ratio of the amplitudes is smaller : @xmath93 , so that the isospin violating amplitude is 20% of the isospin conserving one , an effect that could be related to the mass difference between neutral and charged @xmath94 mesons , considering the contribution of @xmath95 intermediate states to @xmath83 decays .",
    "it has also been suggested that the molecular interpretation would imply that the radiative decay in neutral @xmath94 mesons : @xmath96 should be dominant with respect to @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "however , assuming that @xmath2 is an ordinary @xmath80 charmonium and describing the @xmath98 amplitude by diagrams with @xmath99 and @xmath100 as intermediate particles , the ratio @xmath101 is small , and it is tiny in a wide range of the hadronic parameters governing the decays , therefore @xmath102 is not peculiar of a molecular quarkonium @xmath2 , but it is mostly a phase space effect @xcite .    the photon spectrum is drawn in fig .  1 for extremal values of the hadronic parameters governing the transition .",
    "when the intermediate @xmath99 dominates the decay amplitude , the photon spectrum in the @xmath103 mode coincides with the line corresponding to the @xmath99 decay at @xmath104 mev .",
    "the narrow peak is different from the line shape expected in a molecular description , being broader for larger binding energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the photon spectrum in the charged @xmath105 mode is broader , with a peak at @xmath106 mev , the total @xmath107 rate being severely suppressed with respect to @xmath108",
    ". instead , in the range where @xmath100 gives the main contribution , a peak at @xmath109 mev appears in neutral and charged @xmath94 modes , in the first case together with the structure at @xmath104 mev .",
    "this spectrum was previously described and the radiative decay was interpreted as due to the @xmath84 core of @xmath2@xcite .",
    "we then suggest that its experimental investigation could be a better tool to shed light on the structure of this meson .",
    "in the open charm sector , the @xmath13 meson , @xmath14 seems to be a @xmath58 , a member of the @xmath110 doublet .",
    "we have also briefly discussed about the possible quantum number assignment of @xmath111 . in both cases",
    "the analysis of the @xmath31 mode is crucial .    in the hidden charm sector",
    "we have described the meson @xmath2 , focusing our attention on its radiative decays and pointing out that the smallness of the ratio @xmath112 is not a smoking gun for the molecular nature of this state .",
    "the experimental investigation of the photon spectrum could be useful to shed more light on this puzzling hadron .",
