    "we would like to talk about the virtual photon structure , especially on the mass effects in the polarized photon structure functions . in the last several years",
    ", there has been much interest in the spin - dependent photon structure functions which can be studied in the polarized version of the @xmath8 collider or more directly in the polarized @xmath9 collision in the future linear collider ( figure.1 ) .",
    "now let us consider the two - photon process in the polarized electron - positron collision where both of the photons are off - shell .",
    "we particularly consider the case where the mass square of the probephoton , @xmath10 , is much bigger than that of the targetphoton , @xmath11 , which is in turn much bigger than the square of the qcd scale , @xmath12 .",
    "the advantage for studying the virtual photon target in this kinematical region is that we can calculate whole structure functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 in perturbative qcd up to next - leading - order ( nlo ) , in contrast to the real photon target where there remain uncalculable non - perturbative pieces .",
    "note that the 1st moment of @xmath6 is related to the axial anomaly just like the nucleon case , while the second structure function @xmath7 only exists for the virtual photon target ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "now the possible mass effects are twofold ; target - mass effects and quark - mass effects . here in this",
    "talk we discuss the former , which appear as power - corrections in @xmath5 . for the real photon target ( @xmath14 ) , there is no need to consider target mass corrections .",
    "but when the target becomes off - shell and for relatively low values of @xmath10 , contributions suppressed by powers of @xmath15 may become important .",
    "then we need to take into account these target mass contributions just like the case of the nucleon structure functions .",
    "the consideration of target mass effects ( tme ) is important by another reason . for the virtual photon target ,",
    "the maximal value of the bjorken variable @xmath4 is not 1 but    @xmath16    due to the constraint @xmath17 , which is contrasted with the nucleon case where @xmath18 .",
    "the structure functions should vanish at @xmath19 .",
    "however , the nlo qcd result @xcite for @xmath20 ( see also the second paper of @xcite ) shows that the predicted graph does not vanish but remains finite at @xmath19 . in this talk",
    "we discuss the tme for @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the framework of operator product expansion ( ope ) supplemented by the renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite .",
    "let us consider the structure tensor @xmath22 which is the absorptive part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath23 ( figure 2 ) : @xmath24 for the target photon with mass squared @xmath25 probed by the photon with @xmath26 .",
    "the antisymmetric part @xmath27 under @xmath28 and @xmath29 , can be decomposed as @xmath30 which gives two spin - dependent structure functions , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . when the target is real photon ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath7 is identically zero , and there exists only one spin structure function , @xmath34 . while , for the off - shell or virtual photon ( @xmath35 ) target , we have two spin - dependent structure functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    the deep inelastic photon - photon scattering ( figure 2 . )",
    "amplitude relevant for the polarized structure functions is given by @xmath36 for the product of the two electromagnetic currents we apply the ope and obtain for the @xmath37-@xmath38 antisymmetric part @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the twist-2 and twist-3 operators , respectively , and are both traceless , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are corresponding coefficient functions .",
    "the twist-2 operators @xmath40 have totally symmetric lorentz indices @xmath44 , while the indices of twist-3 operators @xmath41 are totally symmetric among @xmath45 but antisymmetric under @xmath46 .",
    "for the photon target we evaluate  _ matrix elements _ \" of the traceless operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 sandwiched by two photon states with momentum @xmath47 , which are written in the following forms : @xmath48\\cdots\\mu_{n-1}\\}}~,\\label{mattwist3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript amp  stands for the amputation of external photon lines , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are reduced photon matrix elements .",
    "the traceless tensors @xmath51 and @xmath52\\cdots\\mu_{n-1}\\}}$ ] satisfy the traceless conditions for @xmath53 : @xmath54 taking the  of ( [ currentprodfourier ] ) with the virtual photon states , we obtain the deep - inelastic photon - photon forward scattering amplitude .    the basic idea for treating target mass corrections",
    "exactly is to take account of trace terms in the traceless tensors properly @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the contraction between @xmath55 and the traceless tensors without neglecting any of the trace terms .",
    "the results are expressed in terms of gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "now we follow the same procedures as were taken by wandzura  @xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the polarized nucleon case , and we obtain the analytic expression of the nachtmann moments @xcite for the twist-2 and twist-3 operators with definite spin @xmath56 . by writing down the dispersion relations for the amplitudes and with the use of orthogonality relations as well as an integration formula for gegenbauer polynomials @xmath57 , we project out @xmath58 and @xmath59 with definite spin @xmath56 , which still include the infinite series in powers of @xmath5 .",
    "we then sum up those infinite series and express them in compact analytic forms @xcite .",
    "then we obtain the nachtmann moments @xcite : @xmath60 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.5cm}\\quad ( n=1,3,\\cdots ) ,   \\label{nacht2}\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.5cm}m_3^n \\equiv \\sum_i a_{(3)i}^{\\gamma , n}e_{(3 ) i}^n(q^2,p^2,g)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.5cm}=\\int_0^{x_{\\rm max}}\\frac{dx}{x^2}{\\xi}^{n+1}\\left [ \\frac{x}{\\xi}g_1^\\gamma(x , q^2,p^2)\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.5cm}\\left.+\\left\\{\\frac{n}{n-1}\\frac{x^2}{\\xi^2}+ \\frac{n}{n+1}\\frac{p^2x^2}{q^2 } \\right\\}g_2^\\gamma(x , q^2,p^2 ) \\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\quad ( n=3,5 , \\cdots),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the so - called @xmath62-scaling variable @xcite , is given by @xmath63 the allowed range of @xmath62 is @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . in the nucleon case ,",
    "the constraint @xmath66 gives @xmath67 and @xmath68 , leading to the problem of non - vanishing structure function at @xmath69 .",
    "the resolution to this problem was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite , by considering the dynamical higher - twist effects . @xmath70 and @xmath71 are perturbatively calculable .",
    "in fact , the perturbative qcd calculation of @xmath70 has been done in lo  @xcite and in nlo  @xcite , while the qcd analysis of @xmath71 has been carried out in lo for the flavor non - singlet part in the limit of large @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "once the moments @xmath70 and @xmath71 are known , we can derive @xmath31 and @xmath32 as functions of @xmath4 by inverting @xmath70 and @xmath71 as follows : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and we have introduced the following functions first discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath75    in figure 3 , we have shown @xmath31 with tme as a function of @xmath4 ( solid curve ) for @xmath76 gev@xmath77 ( upper ) with @xmath78 gev@xmath77 and for @xmath79 gev@xmath77 ( lower ) with @xmath78 gev@xmath77 . the vertical axis is in units of @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , the qed coupling constant , @xmath82 is the number of active flavors , and @xmath83 with @xmath84 being the electric charge of @xmath85th flavor quark .",
    "also plotted are @xmath31 without tme ( dashed curve ) and the one with tme included up to the first order in @xmath5 ( short - dashed curve ) .",
    "we observe that the target mass effects appear between intermediate @xmath4 and @xmath86 , and that the effects become sizable when the ratio @xmath5 is increased .",
    "the distinction between the behaviors of @xmath6 with and without tme is remarkable near @xmath86 .",
    "we get @xmath87 for @xmath76 gev@xmath77 with @xmath78 gev@xmath77 and @xmath88 for @xmath79 gev@xmath77 with @xmath78 gev@xmath77 .",
    "the graphs of @xmath6 with tme vanish at @xmath86 as they should .",
    "if tme is not taken into account , the polarized virtual photon structure function @xmath31 satisfies the following sum rule @xcite : @xmath89 note for the real photon target we have the vanishing sum rule @xcite .",
    "the right - hand side corresponds to the twist-2 contribution , and actually the first term is the consequence of the qed axial anomaly .",
    "now it will be interesting to see how this is modified when tme is included .",
    "once the target mass corrections are taken into account , the above sum rule is modified to the first nachtmann moment , which reads @xmath90g_1^\\gamma(x , q^2,p^2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.5cm}+\\frac{4}{3}\\int_0^{x_{\\rm max}}dx \\frac{\\xi^2}{x^2}\\frac{p^2x^2}{q^2}g_2^\\gamma(x , q^2,p^2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-0.5 cm } = -\\frac{3\\alpha}{\\pi}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_f}e_i^4+{\\cal o}(\\alpha_s)~.\\label{firstg1with}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the 1st moment of @xmath6 with tme for the nucleon target was discussed in refs .",
    "the power - series expansion in @xmath5 gives the first order tme , the difference of lhs s of ( [ firstg1with ] ) and ( [ firstg1without ] ) : @xmath91    the 1st moment for @xmath7 without tme known as the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule @xcite : @xmath92 turns into the one with tme given by @xmath93 where the upper - limit of the integration has changed from 1 to @xmath86 .",
    "to summarize we have studied the target mass effects in the virtual photon s spin structure functions , @xmath31 and @xmath1 , which can be measured in the future experiments of the polarized version of the @xmath8 or @xmath9 colliders .",
    "the evaluation of kinematical target mass effects is considered to be important to extract dynamical higher - twist effects .",
    "we have derived the expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in closed form by inverting the nachtmann moments for the twist-2 and twist-3 operators .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that the target mass effects appear at large @xmath4 and become sizable near @xmath94 , as the ratio @xmath5 increases .",
    "here we have also examined the target mass effects for the first - moment sum rules of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for the kinematic region",
    "we consider , the corrections to the first moment of @xmath6 turn out to be negligibly small .",
    "the first moment of @xmath7 leads to the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule , where only change exists in the upper limit of integration from 1 to @xmath86 .",
    "there still remain two important subjects to be studied .",
    "the first one is the quark - mass effects in @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the heavy flavor contribution to @xmath95 for the nucleon has been explored in ref.@xcite .",
    "it would be intriguing to investigate the polarized photon case .",
    "another subject yet to be studied is the transition from real to virtual photon , especially the 1st moment sum rule ; how to reconcile the vanishing sum for the former with the non - vanishing one for the latter ."
