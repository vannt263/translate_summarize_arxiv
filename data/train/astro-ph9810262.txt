    "the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) is a long - baseline infrared interferometer installed at palomar observatory , california .",
    "it was developed by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , for nasa as a testbed for interferometric techniques applicable to the keck interferometer ( @xcite ) .",
    "these include high - sensitivity direct - detection interferometry in the infrared with array detectors and dual - star interferometry with phase referencing for narrow - angle astrometry .",
    "however , the technology to implement pti , including active fringe tracking , optical delay lines , laser metrology , and real - time control , is applicable not only to the keck interferometer but also to other missions such as the space interferometry mission ( sim ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "pti also serves as a testbed for interferometric planning , operational , and data - processing and management tools applicable to both missions .",
    "major development of pti began in november 1992 with the commencement of funding from nasa under its tops program .",
    "the interferometer was installed at palomar observatory during the spring of 1995 , and first fringes were obtained in july 1995 .",
    "subsequent work has focused on scientific investigations and engineering of the more advanced observational modes .",
    "figure  [ fig : photo ] is a photograph of the instrument .",
    "pti builds on experience gained with the mark  iii interferometer , which was a visible - wavelength interferometer installed at mt .",
    "wilson , california .",
    "the mark  iii used active fringe tracking for wide - angle astrometry and parametric imaging ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "pti differs from the mark  iii in that it operates in the infrared , and in addition to parametric imaging supports narrow - angle interferometric astrometry implemented using phase referencing , described below .",
    "the development of technology for detecting extrasolar planets is one of the motivations for building pti .",
    "most of the recent discoveries of extrasolar planets have been through measurement of radial velocities ( @xcite ) .",
    "this technique senses the doppler shift of the light from a star caused by the longitudinal component of an unseen companion s motion . a complementary technique to radial velocities is astrometry , which measures the wobble in the position of a star caused by the transverse component of a companion s motion .",
    "while high - accuracy global astrometry remains the purview of space missions , the detection of extrasolar planets through astrometry is primarily a narrow - angle problem , as the measurement can be made with respect to angularly - nearby reference stars . in this case",
    "the atmospheric limits to astrometric accuracy achievable with a long - baseline interferometer are several orders of magnitude below the wide - angle atmospheric limit ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : atmos ] shows the increase in astrometric accuracy achievable in a differential measurement with long baselines and narrow fields . for interferometer baselines of @xmath1100  m , and star separations of 1520  arcsec , accuracies of tens of microarcseconds in an hour measurement are possible .",
    "to exploit this accuracy , both the parent star of the putative planet ( henceforth primary star ) as well as one or more astrometric reference stars ( henceforth secondary stars ) must be detectable by the interferometer .",
    "for the nearby sample , for which the astrometric technique is most sensitive , the primary star will be bright and provide an adequate signal - to - noise ratio within an @xmath2 coherence volume to track",
    ". however , angularly - nearby stars will generally be too faint to fringe track .",
    "but for secondary stars chosen within the isoplanatic patch of the primary star , the primary star can be used as a phase reference ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to synthesize a long coherent integration time , greatly increasing sensitivity .",
    "phase referencing works best in the near - infrared , which provides a large isoplanatic patch and the ability to exploit large apertures . combined with adaptive optics , which corrects wavefront aberrations across the individual pupils , the fringe stabilization provided by phase referencing allows for sensitivities similar to those of a space - based system ( @xcite ) .",
    "sky coverage  the fraction of the sky over which a suitable phase reference is available  is a key metric",
    ". pti , as a testbed with moderate apertures , has limited sky coverage .",
    "however , good sky coverage can be achieved with apertures in the 1.52.0-m range , as proposed for the keck interferometer outriggers ( @xcite ) .",
    "combining phase referencing with simultaneous measurements of two stars is the basis of dual - star astrometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : dualstar ] shows the basic implementation .",
    "light from separate stars in the field - of - view of each aperture is directed into separate interferometers sharing a common baseline .",
    "internal path delays for each interferometer are measured with laser metrology to common fiducials at each aperture .",
    "these common fiducials `` tie together '' the two interferometers , allowing , for example , fringe - tracking errors on the primary star to be fed forward to the secondary star to implement phase referencing .",
    "the secondary interferometer , cophased by the primary interferometer , makes the actual astrometric measurement by switching between the secondary star and the primary star ; the change in delay between the two stars is the astrometric observable .",
    "because of the small field - of - view for the narrow - angle measurements , requirements on baseline knowledge are modest .",
    "the error @xmath3 in a differential astrometric measurement over an angular separation @xmath4 caused by a fractional baseline error of @xmath5 is attenuated by the separation as @xmath6 .",
    "for example , a 100  error in a 100  m baseline for astrometry over a 20  arcsec separation introduces errors of only @xmath120  .",
    "thus , separate metrology of the baseline is generally unnecessary , and baseline solutions can be obtained from wide - angle astrometry using one of the interferometers ( @xcite ) .",
    "pti is located northeast of the 5-m hale telescope at palomar observatory , palomar mountain , california ; figure  [ fig : photo ] is a photograph of the interferometer taken from the catwalk of the 5-m telescope .",
    "the central building houses the optical delay lines , beam - combining laboratory , and the computer / control room .",
    "the three small shelters located north , south , and west of the central building contain the siderostats , telescopes , and dual - star feeds .",
    "light is directed from the siderostat shelters through evacuated pipes to the central building .",
    "pti is operated as a two - element interferometer , combining light from two of the three siderostats at one time .",
    "initial observations combined light from the north and south piers for a 110-m baseline which is oriented 20  east of north .",
    "the inclusion of the west pier allows additional baselines .",
    "table  [ tab : ptistats ] summarizes some key instrument parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig : beamtrain ] is a schematic of the beam train of pti .",
    "light at each aperture is collected by a 50-cm siderostat mirror , which directs the light to a fixed 40-cm telescope ; a wide - angle camera adjacent to the telescope provides coarse star acquisition to get the stars within the field - of - view of the angle tracker in the beam - combining lab .",
    "the 40-cm telescope forms an image of the field , which is split into primary and secondary beams by the dual - star feed ; fast - steering mirrors in the dual - star feed correct for wavefront tilt .",
    "the two beams from each aperture are directed through beam pipes to the central building where they are directed into a common long delay line , providing identical delays for the two beams .",
    "local metrology of the delay line is used for servo control .",
    "beam compressors reduce the beam diameters to a more convenient size before sending the primary star through a short delay line .",
    "this delay line introduces a differential delay between primary and secondary to enable phase referencing within the isoplanatic patch .",
    "pti has separate beam combiners for the primary and secondary stars . in each the visible light ( 0.71.0  )",
    "is split off with a dichroic beamsplitter and directed to an angle - tracker which controls the fast - steering mirrors in the dual - star feeds .",
    "the infrared light ( 1.62.4  ) is combined in a michelson beam combiner feeding one 128@xmath7128-pixel quadrant of a nicmos-3 array . in dual - star mode , `` constant - term '' metrology ( sec .",

    "while the choice of a 40-cm aperture for pti was established primarily on the basis of cost , it is also well matched to average atmospheric conditions .",
    "for nominal 1  arcsec seeing , the coherence diameter @xmath8 at 2.2  is 53  cm ; thus a @xmath9 = 40-cm aperture is well corrected with only modest tip / tilt correction .",
    "the pti design incorporates most of the usual system requirements .",
    "the layout is highly symmetric in order to minimize visibility losses due to differential image rotation and differential phase effects . to maintain high throughput , most optics use protected - silver coatings .",
    "transmissive optics are generally antireflection - coated ir - transmissive fused silica , which work well out to 2.5  .",
    "dust covers are used in most places to protect the optics , and a co@xmath10-snow gun is used to clean the siderostat mirrors .",
    "atmospheric dispersion is relatively small over the k  band ( app .",
    "[ sec : disp ] ) , and thus air delay lines can be used , allowing for considerable simplicity of implementation . however , because of the long propagation paths in the delay lines and in beam transport , care must be taken to minimize turbulence , as discussed below .",
    "the system was designed to be highly modular .",
    "this allowed subsystem assembly and testing prior to installation at the site .",
    "for example , the pointing system was debugged on the roof of our lab at jpl , while closed - loop operation of the fringe tracker with the delay line was accomplished in the basement of the same building .",
    "this modularity extended to the computer system , where subsystems were allocated their own real - time computer board , even if computational needs did not mandate it , in order to simplify the development process .",
    "the central building is a t - shaped modular insulated building with a length of 30.5  m. the top part of the building , 6.1  m @xmath7 18.3  m , houses the beam - combining lab and computer room ; the latter is partitioned off from the rest of the building and located adjacent to the driveway in fig .",
    "[ fig : photo ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : building ] gives more detail .",
    "the beam - combining lab includes three optical tables .",
    "these optical tables are grouted onto 0.45-m ",
    "diameter concrete posts on top of a central isolation pad .",
    "the center 1.2  m @xmath7 3.7  m table supports relay optics , beam compressors , metrology components , and the short delay lines .",
    "the other two 1.2  m @xmath7 2.4  m tables support 1.2  m @xmath7 2.4  m @xmath7 0.1  m breadboards on which are assembled the primary and secondary beam combiners ; the use of breadboards simplified integration at palomar , as most assembly could take place at jpl .",
    "the long part of the building , 4.9  m @xmath7 24.4  m , encloses the long delay lines .",
    "two 22  m @xmath7 0.6-m  deep i - beams provide the primary delay - line support .",
    "they attach via embedded j - bolts to the central isolation pad at the front and at 3 other isolated pads along their length .",
    "box - beam crosspieces , 0.10  m @xmath7 0.15  m @xmath7 1.7  m , are located at 0.6  m intervals along the i - beam .",
    "each delay line runs on a pair of 38.1-mm  diameter round steel rails with extruded aluminum supports which mount to the crosspieces ; a center square rail is used for the friction drive .",
    "the support system allows for three delay lines , although only two are installed .",
    "a `` building - in - a - building '' , an approach first used on the susi interferometer ( @xcite ) , is implemented using 1.2  m @xmath7 2.4  m @xmath7 0.05  m rigid insulating panels surrounding the optical tables and long delay lines as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : building ] .",
    "the building - in - a - building allows the heating and air - conditioning units , which are mounted on isolated pads , to run continually , maintaining a constant interior temperature without affecting internal seeing .",
    "additional thermal - control measures include the use of white paint on the building driveway and adjacent road ; white - gravel is used in the vicinity of the siderostat shelters .    the siderostat shelters house the siderostats , telescopes , and dual - star feeds .",
    "they are insulated buildings , 5.2  m @xmath7 2.7  m , elevated 1.5  m above the local grade . with the exception of one fixed wall ,",
    "the roof and upper wall roll back on supports , as seen in the foreground shelter in fig .",
    "[ fig : photo ] , leaving a 0.75-m  high lower wall . in operation",
    ", a windscreen made of rigid insulating panels surrounds the interior optics , and a separate cover encloses the dual - star feed .",
    "the shelter includes an electronics rack for the remote electronics , which is vented to the outside .",
    "the pipes that bring light from the siderostat shelters to the central building are evacuated tubes capped with ir - transmissive fused silica windows . they terminate approximately 1-m from the siderostat shelters . during observations ,",
    "when the shelter roofs are rolled back , short lengths of pvc pipe enclose the light paths from the end of the evacuated pipes to the edge of the dual - star feed cover to minimize local seeing .",
    "similarly , at the termination of the evacuated pipes at the walls of the central building , short lengths of pvc pipe enclose the light path into the building - in - a - building .",
    "we note that the light pipes were originally simple non - evacuated insulated aluminum tubes .",
    "sufficiently insulated , these tubes worked acceptably for propagating the 2-  stellar beams .",
    "however , as part of a system upgrade in 1997 ( @xcite ) , the tubes were replaced with evacuated pipes , which improved the propagation of the 633-nm constant - term metrology beams , which make a double - pass through the tubes .",
    "the driving disturbance in the air pipes was the temperature difference between the tops of the pipes , radiatively cooling to the sky , and the bottoms , which would be coupled to the warmer ground .",
    "while the insulation minimized the effect , some convection was seen at dusk when setting up the instrument ; we suspect that the air pipes would be entirely acceptable if buried and away from diurnal disturbances .",
    "the siderostat mount is an alt - az gimbal moving a 50-cm zerodur flat .",
    "the mirror is supported on a 9-point wiffletree suspension .",
    "adjustable hard - points , opposed by spring plungers , locate the mirror surface with the altitude axis .",
    "the altitude bearing mounts can be shimmed to align the altitude and azimuth axes . the mount provides access to the back surface of the siderostat mirror through a hole in the mirror cell .",
    "a contacting depth gauge , encoded by a laser interferometer , was used to measure from a fixed point off the mount to the front or back of the siderostat mirror with the mount rotated to ( az , el ) coordinates of ( 0@xmath11 , 0@xmath11 ) , ( 180@xmath11 , 0@xmath11 ) , ( 0@xmath11 , 180@xmath11 ) , and ( 180@xmath11 , 180@xmath11 ) .",
    "combined with the center thickness of the siderostat mirror , these measurements allow determination of the offset between the two axes and the mirror surface offset .",
    "( as the measurements are always made at near - normal incidence to the front or back surface of the mirror , tolerances on the precise mount angles at which measurements are made are relatively loose . )",
    "the mount is adjusted to keep deviations from an ideal siderostat to @xmath12100  .",
    "mirror edge location is via delrin tabs , and the unbalanced altitude load is compensated with a counterweight .",
    "the system is driven with a dc servo motor .",
    "it provides 0.027  arcsec motor steps and a maximum slew rate of @xmath11/s .",
    "direct axis encoding is provided by 6.48-arcsec optical encoders ; the zero points of each axis are defined by magnetic proximity switches on the main wheel repeatable to less than one encoder step .",
    "computer readable `` soft '' limit switches indicate extremes of travel while `` hard '' limits protect against software failures by disabling the siderostat drive .",
    "[ [ control - aspects ] ] control aspects + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the real - time control system for the siderostats provides track and slew control based on sidereal targets from the instrument sequencer , as well as variety of other target types .",
    "slew and track control use rate feedback to the axis indexers : large - angle slews use the encoders for closed - loop control , while tracking uses the indexer position ; transition between modes is automatic based on the size of the tracking error .",
    "the controller accepts offsets from the acquisition cameras and angle trackers for star acquisition , and from the angle tracker for fast - steering - mirror desaturation .",
    "the translation from sidereal targets to mount position is via an 8-parameter mount model which incorporates the orientation of the axes , the zero points of the axes rotations , the orientation of the siderostat mirror in its cell , and the direction of the feed beam from the telescope .",
    "these parameters are determined via an off - line least - squares routine using pointing residuals to known targets ; when properly calibrated , open - loop pointing is good to @xmath115  arcsec rms  well within the field - of - view of the acquisition system .",
    "the only nightly calibration required of the siderostat system is a homing process to establish the encoder zero points .",
    "manual paddle controls are provided but are not required in normal operation .    for observations in 1997",
    "an accelerometer feedforward system was implemented to compensate for a small amount of piston attributable to the siderostats which was detectable in the fringe phase .",
    "the system uses an accelerometer mounted to the back of each siderostat mirror which senses acceleration along the mirror normal .",
    "analog electronics filter and doubly integrate the accelerometer output to provide a measure of the mirror piston above 1.5  hz .",
    "this signal is digitized at 2  khz , scaled by @xmath13 , where @xmath4 is the angle between the siderostat normal and the telescope feedbeam , and is fed forward to the delay line for compensation .",
    "the siderostat mirror directs light to a 40-cm cassegrain telescope .",
    "however , preceding the telescope , an elliptical mirror located in the shadow of the telescope secondary directs a fraction of the stellar beam to a wide - angle star acquisition system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : acq ] . given the long baselines and high magnification of the beam - transport system , accurate pointing is required in order for starlight to enter the field - of - view of the angle tracker inside the beam - combining lab .",

    "the camera is preceded by a 90-mm diameter , 1300-mm focal - length telescope followed by a 2:1 teleconverter .",
    "these provide an angular scale of 1.8  arcsec / pixel over a field - of - view of 12x18  arcmin ; smaller fields are selectable via subframe readout .",
    "the acquisition system incorporates a 70-mm corner cube for calibration .",
    "the corner cube is located at the edge of the elliptical mirror feeding the acquisition system so that a portion of a boresight laser injected in the beam - combining lab and fed backwards through the system is intercepted and directed into the acquisition camera .",

    "feedback of centroids to the siderostats is used to automate the acquisition process .",
    "the acquisition system also provides information on apparent star magnitude to the angle tracker .",
    "the acquisition system provides several calibration modes .",
    "a _ primary boresight _ , done at the beginning of a night , records the image centroid of the primary boresight laser retroreflected off the acquisition corner cube ; this location establishes the initial zero point for star centroiding .",
    "this zero point is updated between scans , once the angle tracker has acquired the star , using a _ star boresight _ , which records the current stellar position .",
    "the repeated star boresights remove drifts in the acquisition system as well as any systematic offsets due to aberrations in the primary laser image . for dual - star operations a _ secondary boresight _",
    "measures the image centroid of the secondary boresight laser .",
    "this is used to servo the secondary star selector mirror in the dual - star feed to coalign the secondary and primary boresights .",

    "the north and south telescopes employ a thermally - compensated truss ( @xcite ) with invar truss elements and aluminum end pieces , while the west telescope uses a rail - mounted secondary which is athermalized with an invar metering rod .",
    "the telescopes use an f/3 primary and provide an f/10 output beam at a back focal distance of 400  mm .",

    "the metrology light enters and exits through two additional apertures on the delay line front plate .",
    "flat mirrors , rather than corner reflectors , are used for the metrology endpoints because of their tolerance to beam shear .",
    "a matched pair of optical wedges is used over the metrology apertures on the delay - line front plate so that the metrology light focuses to a slightly different location on the delay - line secondary mirror ; thus any laser scatter from secondary - mirror imperfections falls outside of the starlight field - of - view .",
    "the 2-mhz reference signal from the laser source plate and 2-mhz unknown signals from the active and passive long delay line metrology heads are digitized and fed to a custom laser fringe - counter card .",
    "the card counts integral and fractional fringes , providing 32  bits of integer and 8  bits of fraction , for a delay resolution with the double - pass implementation of 1.2  nm over a range of 1300  m. limiting doppler excursions to @xmath01  mhz allows for delay slew rates of @xmath00.3  m / s .      assuming a reasonably stable optical train , the long delay line metrology described above is all that is needed for single - star amplitude observations .",
    "drifts in the unmonitored optical paths , as well as drifts between the ( slightly different ) metrology and starlight paths through the delay line , are tracked out by the fringe servo and at worst affect only the acquisition time of the fringe tracker .",
    "however , for cophasing and astrometry , metrology of the entire starlight path , common mode with the starlight , is required . for wide - angle astrometry , both from the ground , and also from space ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the interferometer baseline is defined by the location of a corner reflector located on the surface of the siderostat mirror .",
    "external metrology of the corner reflector monitors baseline changes , while internal ( constant - term ) metrology monitors internal optical paths from the beam combiners to the same point .",
    "however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : narrowangle ] , the requirements on baseline stability for narrow - angle astrometry are much less than for wide - angle astrometry , and it is possible to move the corner cube off the siderostat to a point in the collimated space between the siderostat and dsf .    in the dsf design of fig .",
    "[ fig : dsf ] , the sssm is conjugate to the 40  cm beam from the siderostat at the plane containing the telescope secondary mirror .",
    "this pupil is thus a good location for a retroreflector , as the metrology beam does not shear as the sssm is adjusted .",
    "alternately , this plane can be reimaged as shown in the figure .",
    "lens l1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsf ] forms an image of this plane ( and the sssm ) in collimated space at the location of corner cube cc .",
    "a portion of the metrology light injected from the beam combiners along the primary and secondary paths thus retroreflects off of this common fiducial .",
    "the constant - term metrology system on pti is a separate heterodyne system from the long delay line metrology system .",
    "the constant - term source plate uses a stabilized laser to generate two dual - polarization beams : one at a frequency difference of 110  khz at a frequency offset of 27  mhz from the laser frequency for the primary beam combiner , and a second with a frequency difference of 440  khz at a frequency offset of @xmath10627  mhz from the laser frequency for the secondary combiner .",
    "the source plate samples each beam to generate 110 and 440  khz reference signals .",
    "initially , consider only the primary constant - term metrology .",

    "[ fig : primary ] and retraces the starlight path of each arm to the dsf .",
    "part of the light reflects off the star - separator beamsplitter to corner cube cc , retroreflects , and returns to the primary beam combiner where it is extracted by a dichroic beamsplitter located between beamsplitter b3 and lens l5 .",
    "as the starlight beamsplitter is non - polarizing , it is necessary to add polarizers such that the _ s _ polarization traverses one arm and the _ p _ polarization the other . to achieve this ,",
    "small polarizers are placed in each arm over the fraction of the pupil used by the metrology beam .",
    "alternatively , polarizers could be used directly in front of the corner cubes in the dsf ( although the polarization state has degraded somewhat by that point ) .",
    "the extracted metrology beam detected through a cross polarizer is a measure of the difference in the optical pathlengths between the two arms of the interferometer . with the exception of the thin polarizers , this implementation is fully common mode with the starlight , but it is not especially efficient with respect to laser light .",
    "the relatively low polarization difference frequency allows for more sensitive metrology electronics ( than those used for the long delay lines ) to ensure a good snr .",
    "the constant - term metrology signal is digitized and measured with a digital fringe counter , similar to the one for the long delay line system .",
    "the secondary constant - term metrology system works identically to the primary one , using the same fiducials . however ,",
    "examination of fig .",
    "[ fig : dsf ] shows that when the sssm is adjusted so that the primary and secondary beam combiners are boresighted ( a calibration mode for dual - star astrometry ) , the primary metrology light leaks into the secondary path , and vice versa .",
    "the frequency arrangement above , with different difference and offset frequencies for primary and secondary , ensures that the only in - band leakage terms are at the frequency difference of the other metrology system .",
    "these leakage terms are filtered out of the analog signal with bandpass filters .",
    "for differential astrometry the primary and secondary constant - term measurements , @xmath107 and @xmath108 , are combined with the phase offsets from the primary and secondary fringe trackers to yield the astrometric delays @xmath109the difference of the two delays , @xmath110 , is the narrow - angle astrometric observable .",
    "this difference is also used as the error signal for servo control of the small delay line .",
    "the difference @xmath111 is calibrated by simultaneous measurements of the same ( primary ) star by both the primary and secondary fringe trackers .",
    "the real - time control system on pti controls the hardware of the individual subsystems as well as orchestrating the interactions between subsystems and providing overall instrument sequencing .",

    "real - time control and sequencing on pti is implemented with 7 vme - based 68040 single - board computers ( sbcs ) interfaced to a sun workstation , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtc ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of the real - time computers use the vxworks operating system and c / c++ .",
    "cardcage 1 contains 4 sbcs , one each for control of the siderostat system , the angle - tracking system , the acquisition system , and overall instrument sequencing . while the angle - tracker detector interfaces directly to this cardcage using a custom photon - binning board , most of the controlled hardware is located at the siderostat piers .",
    "small slave card cages at these locations are accessed via fiber - optic bus repeaters to allow low - latency hardware access .",
