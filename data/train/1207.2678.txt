    "nonlinear systems which give different types of redistribution of matter or energy ( intensity ) are intensively studied in modern physics .",
    "nonlinear processes can yield unusual forms of energy distribution . as a rule ,",
    "they are described by nonlinear equations , such as the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) , the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgle ) , their various modifications , or other @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in many instances that the cgle describes spatio - temporal localized structures , also called `` dissipative solitons '' @xcite .",
    "the nls is associated with a lot of physical phenomena , including rogue waves @xcite . in nonlinear systems",
    "amazing processes may exist , such as strong bursts of energy during the interaction of solitons @xcite .",
    "mixing of several waves in a nonlinear medium very often leads to the redistribution of the wave intensities . as a rule ,",
    "the parametric interaction processes are considered , when a monochromatic wave is amplified by a pumping wave which has another frequency @xcite .",
    "when the monochromatic waves interact in the nonlinear medium , one observes the effects of the self - action of the waves .",
    "the energy transfer is a peculiarity of the degenerate four - wave mixing ( fwm ) in media with a nonlocal response which takes place during self - diffraction of waves from the dynamical grating @xcite .",
    "the background of this effect lies in a shift between the light interference pattern and a dynamical refractive index grating .",
    "this brings an additional phase shift between the transmitted and diffracted waves during their interference in the medium .",
    "the intensity ratio of input waves is a control parameter , which defines the magnitude of the energy transfer and amplification coefficient for a signal wave @xcite .",
    "the fwm in media with a nonlocal response , when the self - diffraction of waves on a dynamical grating occurs , is one more physical system that is described by the cgle @xcite . in the present work we find the cgle which describes the formation and evolution of the `` dark '' dissipative soliton along the longitudinal direction of wave propagation .",
    "the envelope of the refractive index distribution @xmath1 has a soliton - like form .",
    "all other characteristics of the fwm ( wave intensities , diffraction efficiency ) are expressed through this function @xmath1 .",
    "the stable soliton - type pattern is obtained as a consequence of the nonlocal nature of the nonlinear response , which provides an additional phase shift for the waves diffracted by an inhomogeneous structure of the refractive index , and there is the interference between the diffracted and the propagating waves .",
    "the present research allows one to predict new effects of nonlinear wave interaction , based on the properties of the soliton - like refractive index pattern . as examples ,",
    "we predict new effects , which take place during the interaction of a signal pulse and a continuous pump wave , and which are determined depending on suitable initial conditions for the interacting waves and nonlinearity of the medium .",
    "one of them is the retention of the shape of a signal pulse at the end of a bulk nonlinear medium , an application of which , for example , can be the transmission of pulses in long optical lines .",
    "a second effect is a significant nonlinear amplification of a weak signal pulse at the expense of a continuous pumping wave , when a backward pumping wave is almost completely reflected from the nonuniform grating and redistributes its energy to a forward signal pulse .",
    "this phenomenon can be used for the creation of pulses of great energy .",
    "the four - wave mixing is a process which in the degenerate case ( all waves have the same frequencies ) leads to many effects of self - action of waves during their interaction in a nonlinear medium .",
    "the phenomenon of the self - diffraction of waves during fwm combines three simultaneous processes : the recording of a time - dependent refractive index grating by the light interference pattern , the wave diffraction by the grating , and the interference between the propagated and diffracted waves .",
    "when the medium displays a nonlocal response due to some kind of transport mechanism , one can write an evolution equation governing the dynamics of the induced nonlinearity , which is added to the fwm coupled wave system .    the fwm has been previously investigated in the transmission geometry , when the coupled waves record the transmission dynamical grating and diffract on it ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.refl.scheme]a ) . in nonlocal media both the intensity pattern and the grating amplitude distribution share the properties of a bright dissipative soliton @xcite .",
    "we have derived the cubic cgle with a time dependent gain / loss coefficient which describes the dynamics of the fwm in the restrictive case of a purely nonlocal response of the medium ( @xmath2 is a purely imaginary constant ) .",

    "while in the transmission geometry the propagation of the waves is considered in the @xmath9 plane and the grating vector is directed just along the @xmath10-axis , in the reflection geometry the problem is one - dimensional and all the vectors are parallel to the @xmath11-axis .",
    "also these two systems have different first integrals .",

    "the complex values of @xmath2 , @xmath23 and @xmath16 show that a diffracted wave gets some additional phase shift relative to a propagated wave after the diffraction from the refractive index grating . in the case of a purely nonlocal response ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) this phase shift equals @xmath34 for the wave diffracted in the direction of the polar axis and @xmath35 for the wave diffracted in the opposite direction . in this special case in the steady state , the wave equations ( [ eqfwm ] ) becomes real , where the waves 1 and 4 are amplified at the expense of the waves 2 and 3 , which transfer their energy to the waves 1 and 4 respectively .",
    "the energy transfer between interacting waves takes place if the medium has a purely nonlocal response .",

    "in the simplest case , the four - wave mixing in the reflection geometry can be reduced to the two - wave mixing ( twm ) , which describes the interaction of forward and backward waves .",
    "then the fwm momentum conservation law takes the form @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , @xmath81 are the @xmath11-components of the wave vectors for the forward and backward waves respectively . in the next sections we consider the effects which arise in this simplest case of the twm in a medium with a purely nonlocal response @xmath33 ,",

    "so , one can define this spatial nonuniform pattern as the dark dissipative soliton .",
    "modulation of the refractive index takes the same structure as the dark dissipative soliton , in which the interacting waves undergo diffraction .",

    "the inflection point of the @xmath0 function of @xmath95 is located outside the boundaries for small signal and big pump intensity .",
    "the grating amplitude has uniform distribution within the boundaries , and the gain coefficient of the signal ( @xmath115 ) is maximal possible in a given nonlinear medium .",
    "when one increases the signal beam intensity as compared to the pump beam intensity , which is accompanied by a motion of the grating amplitude envelope , the inflection point of the @xmath95 @xmath0 function is already located inside the boundaries , so that the nonuniform distribution of the grating amplitude is formed inside the nonlinear medium with the maximum being located close to the output boundary @xmath84 .",
    "the area under the envelope will decrease , then the amplification coefficient of the signal beam decreases too . in this way we show that , by changing the input intensity ratio , the coefficient of the energy transfer will also be changed .",
    "the reason for that is the motion of the grating amplitude envelope and the self - formation of either a uniform distribution or a nonuniform structure of the grating amplitude in the nonlinear medium . at the same time",
    "the most pronounced effects connected with the alteration of the signal beam will occur when the nonuniform dynamical grating is located inside a nonlinear medium",
    ". then small changes of the intensity ratio will lead to the motion of the grating envelope and therefore to significant changes of the output signal .",

    "this figure displays the following remarkable feature peculiar to just the reflection geometry of the wave - mixing : the nonunifrom distribution of the grating envelope may be created in media with small or average nonlinear coefficients .",
    "therefore , in order to implement the effects of beam control , large nonlinearities of the medium are unnecessary .",

    "we choose a gaussian beam with respect to time in the form @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the intensity of the background , @xmath121 is the maximum of the signal pulse and @xmath122 is its duration . in this way , we consider the case of the self - diffraction of a signal pulse on a given grating , which is created by a small background intensity @xmath120 of the wave 1 and by the continuous pump wave 2 .",
    "we point out that the background can be negligibly small ( e.g.  a scattered wave , a reflected wave ) , but it should exist to build up the given grating . we will show that the output signal will depend on the intensity ratio between the pump and the maximum signal , on the coupling coefficient of the nonlinear medium as well as on the properties of the signal pulse itself , i.e.  on its duration and even on its shape .    in the case of a weak pump the signal pulse retains its shape on the output of the cavity . in fig .",

[ fig.refl.retention ] .",
    "]    the effect of the signal amplification depends strongly on the value of the photoinduced optical nonlinearity , but in a nonobvious way : the amplification can be lowered by increasing the coupling constant @xmath117 ( see fig .",

    "the explanation of this phenomenon is the same as that discussed in section [ section : iii ] for the twm in the steady state : for high values of @xmath117 the grating amplitude distribution is uniform over a volume of the nonlinear medium . in this case , changes of the input intensity ratio have little influence on the redistribution of the grating amplitude , this will have little effect on the intensity of the output signal .",
    "big changes can be reached when the distribution of the grating amplitude is not uniform over the volume of the medium . in such a case",

    "the expansion of this model for the case of interaction and diffraction of noncoherent waves with different frequencies is of undoubted interest .",
    "we have explained that the coefficient of energy transfer depends on whether a uniform or a nonuniform distribution of the grating amplitude is formed within the volume of the nonlinear medium .",
    "this , in turn , is determined by the intensity ratio of the input waves .",
    "we have found two interesting effects arising because of the interaction of a signal pulse with a continuous pump illumination in a nonlocal medium , the reason for that being a redistribution of the dynamical grating .",
    "the first effect is the restoration of the form of the input pulse on the output which takes place when the pump intensity is either comparable to or less than the maximum of the signal pulse .",
    "but when one increases the pump intensity as compared to the signal , one observes a significant nonlinear amplification of a seed pulse .",
    "this effect is due to the fact that the seed pulse provokes the creation of such a grating , which reflects almost the entire pump wave in the direction of the signal .",
    "different types of applications can be used in the system depending on suitable input conditions , for example , transmission of pulses over long distance in fiber amplifiers , or significant amplification of short pulses in a nonlinear optical cavity .",
