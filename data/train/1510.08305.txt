    "over the last decade , charm meson spectroscopy has undergone a resurgence due to the discovery of numerous excited charm and charm - strange states by the @xmath28-factory experiments babar and belle @xcite and by the cleo experiment @xcite .",
    "more recently the lhcb experiment has demonstrated the capability of both observing these states and determining their properties @xcite .",
    "this has led to considerable theoretical interest in attempting to make quark model spectroscopic assignments for these new states by comparing theoretical predictions to experimental measurements @xcite . at the same time",
    ", steady progress is being made in lattice qcd @xcite for which these experimental results and spectroscopic classifications are an important benchmark . with the start of higher energy and higher luminosity beams at the lhc and higher luminosity at the superkekb @xmath29",
    "collider we expect that more new states will be observed . to identify newly discovered states ,",
    "a theoretical roadmap is needed .",
    "the quark model has been successful in taking on this role and we turn to it to calculate the properties of excited charm and charm - strange mesons .",
    "an important property of heavy - light mesons is that in the limit that the heavy quark mass becomes infinite the properties of the meson are determined by those of the light quark @xcite .",
    "the light quarks are characterized by their total angular momentum @xmath30 such that @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the light quark spin and @xmath33 is its orbital angular momentum .",
    "@xmath30 is combined with @xmath34 , the spin of the heavy quark , to give the total angular momentum of the meson .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath34 and @xmath30 are separately conserved .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath35 , the states will be grouped into doublets characterized by the angular momentum of the light quark .",
    "for example , the four @xmath36 @xmath37-wave mesons can be grouped into two doublets characterized by the angular momentum of the light quark @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath37 are the total angular momentum and parity of the excited meson . in the heavy quark limit ( hql )",
    "the members of the doublets will be degenerate in mass , and this degeneracy is broken by @xmath43 corrections @xcite . for the @xmath36 multiplet , heavy quark symmetry and conservation of parity and @xmath30 also predict that the strong decays @xmath44 will only proceed through a @xmath45-wave while the decays @xmath46 will only proceed via an @xmath47-wave @xcite .",
    "the states decaying to a @xmath45-wave are expected to be narrow due to the angular momentum barrier while those decaying to an @xmath47-wave are expected to be broad .",
    "similar patterns are predicted for higher @xmath35 multiplets so that measuring the properties of excited charm mesons can be used to both help identify them and to see how well excited states are described by the properties expected in the heavy quark limit .",
    "however , for higher mass states more phase space is available , leading to more possible decay channels , resulting in more complicated decay patterns so that the predictions of the hql are less apparent .",
    "our goals for this paper are twofold .",
    "first we want to provide a roadmap of charm and charm - strange meson properties to identify which states are the most promising candidates to be observed and the final states they are most likely to be observed in . hereafter , for conciseness , we will generally refer to both charm and charm - strange mesons as charm mesons .",
    "second , when new states are observed we can use our roadmap to make quark model spectroscopic assignments for these newly found states .    in the first part of this paper",
    "we calculate the masses and wavefunctions of excited charm and charm - strange mesons using the relativized quark model @xcite which we describe in the next section .",
    "radiative transitions are described in section  [ sec : emtransitions ] and strong decay widths are calculated using the @xmath0 quark - pair creation model @xcite which is described in section  [ sec : strongdecays ] .",
    "these models have been described extensively in the literature so rather than repeating detailed descriptions of these models we will give brief summaries and refer the interested reader to the references for further details .",
    "the outcome of this part of the paper is a comprehensive summary of excited charm meson properties .    in the second part , in sections  [ sec : charm_classification ] and [ sec : charm_strange_classification ]",
    ", we use these results to examine the numerous newly observed charm and charm - strange mesons and attempt to make quark model spectroscopic assignments .",
    "this approach has been used in numerous papers although in some cases different calculations come to different conclusions .",
    "thus , another goal of this paper is to suggest further diagnostic measurements that can resolve these differences to give an unambiguous spectroscopic assignment . in section",
    "[ sec : finding_the_missing ] we will use the quark model roadmap we produced in the first part of this paper to suggest which missing states , because of their properties , are most likely to be observed in the near future and suggest the most promising final states to study . we summarize our conclusions in the final section .",
    "we use the relativized quark model @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) to calculate meson masses and their wavefunctions which we use to calculate decay properties .",
    "the model is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite to which we direct the interested reader .",
    "the general characteristics of this model are that it assumes a relativistic kinetic energy term and the potential incorporates a lorentz vector one - gluon - exchange interaction with a qcd motivated running coupling constant , @xmath48 , and a lorentz scalar linear confining interaction .",
    "this is typical of most such models which are based on some variant of the coulomb plus linear potential expected from qcd and that often include some relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "the relativized quark model has been reasonably successful in describing most known mesons and has proven to be a useful guide to understanding newly found states @xcite .",
    "however in recent years , starting with the discovery of the @xmath49 @xcite and @xmath50 states @xcite , an increasing number of states have been observed that do not fit into this picture @xcite pointing to the need to include physics which has hitherto been neglected such as coupled channel effects @xcite which appears to be most important for states lying near kinematic thresholds . as a consequence of neglecting coupled channel effects and the crudeness of the relativization procedure we do not expect the mass predictions to be accurate to better than @xmath51  mev .",
    "for the case of a quark and antiquark of unequal mass , charge conjugation parity is no longer a good quantum number so that states with different total spins but with the same total angular momentum , such as the @xmath52 and @xmath53 pairs , can mix via the spin orbit interaction or some other mechanism .",
    "consequently , the physical @xmath54 @xmath37-wave states are linear combinations of @xmath55 and @xmath56 which we describe by : @xmath57 where @xmath58 designates the relative angular momentum of the @xmath59 pair and the subscript @xmath54 is the total angular momentum of the @xmath59 pair which is equal to @xmath35 , and @xmath60 can represent either a @xmath61 , @xmath62 or @xmath63 quark .",
    "there are analogous expressions for higher @xmath35 states where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , etc .",
    "our notation implicitly implies @xmath66 coupling between the quark spins and the relative orbital angular momentum . in the heavy quark limit",
    "in which the heavy quark mass @xmath67 , the states can be described by the total angular momentum of the light quark , @xmath30 , which couples to the spin of the heavy quark and corresponds to @xmath68 coupling . in this limit",
    "the mixed states are given by @xcite @xmath69 the @xmath70 state that is mainly spin triplet corresponds to the primed state in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mixing ] and the @xmath71 that is mainly spin singlet corresponds to the unprimed state . for @xmath36",
    "the hql gives rise to two doublets , one with @xmath40 and the other with @xmath38 and with the conventions of eqns .",
    "[ eqn : mixing ] and [ eqn : hqlmixing ] corresponds to @xmath72 . for @xmath73",
    "the hql gives two doublets with @xmath74 and @xmath75 with mixing angle @xmath76 .",
    "the minus signs arise from our @xmath59 convention .",
    "some authors prefer to use the @xmath68 basis @xcite but since we solve our hamiltonian equations assuming @xmath66 eigenstates and then include the @xmath77 mixing we use the notation of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mixing ] .",
    "radiative transitions are sensitive to the @xmath78 mixing angle .",
    "we note that the definition of the mixing angles are fraught with ambiguities .",
    "for example , charge conjugating @xmath59 into @xmath79 flips the sign of the angle and the phase convention depends on the order of coupling @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xcite .            to solve the hamiltonian to obtain masses and wavefunctions we used the following parameters : the slope of the linear confining potential is 0.18 gev@xmath83 , @xmath84 gev , @xmath85  gev and @xmath86 gev .",
    "the predictions of our model for the charm mesons are given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and for the charm - strange mesons in fig  [ fig2 ] and the predicted masses and @xmath87 mixing angles are given in tables  [ tab : spmasses ] and [ tab : dfgmasses ] .",
    ".predicted charm and charm - strange @xmath47 and @xmath37-wave meson masses , spin - orbit mixing angles and @xmath88 s .",
    "the @xmath89 states and mixing angles are defined using the convention of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mixing ] .",
    "where two values of @xmath88 are listed , the first value is for the singlet state and the second value is for the triplet state .",
    "[ tab : spmasses ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the remaining new state is the @xmath23 .",
    "this state has been studied by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "we start by noting that it has only been seen by one experiment , babar @xcite , albeit with 6.0 standard deviation statistical significance .",
    "it has only been seen in the @xmath90 final state implying it is of unnatural parity ; @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , etc .",
    "of all the states with these quantum numbers the predicted masses for the @xmath96 and @xmath97 states are closest to the observed mass , 3038  mev and 3018  mev respectively .",
    "the @xmath97 is expected to have a total width of 143  mev and a br to the @xmath90 final state of 43% while the @xmath98 is expected to have a total width of 148  mev with br to @xmath90 of 25% .",
    "the experimental error on the width is quite large , @xmath99  mev and there is considerable theoretical uncertainty on the predicted width which could be up to a factor of 2 . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath23 could be either state .",
    "referring to table  [ tab : ds_2p1 ] the @xmath100 final state might be a useful discriminator between these two possibilities ; the @xmath98 is predicted to have a br of 22% to @xmath100 while for the @xmath97 it is predicted to be 5% .",
    "another possibility is that because the states are relatively close together and broad , perhaps babar observed two overlapping states .",
    "a means of discriminating between these possibilities is to measure br s to different final states .",
    "for example , we estimate that the branching ratios of the @xmath24 to @xmath100 and @xmath101 are 22% and 2.8% respectively versus 43% and 11.3% respectively for the @xmath25 .",
    "measurement of br s to these final states would provide a good discriminator for these possibilities ( see also ref .",
    "a final possibility is that the observed state does decay to @xmath27 but that it simply was not observed .",
    "the @xmath102 state is predicted to have a mass @xmath103  mev , total width 132  mev with br s to @xmath90 and @xmath27 of 23% and 6.5% respectively .",
    "it may have been that the signal in the @xmath27 final state was simply too small to see with limited statistics .    while we consider it most likely that the @xmath23 is a member of the @xmath104 multiplet we mention other possibilities for completeness . other unnatural parity states with masses not too far from the @xmath23 are the @xmath15 with @xmath105  mev and @xmath106  mev , the @xmath16 with @xmath107  mev and @xmath108  mev , the @xmath109 with @xmath110  mev and @xmath111  mev and the @xmath112 with @xmath113  mev and @xmath114  mev .",
    "however we consider all of these possibilities unlikely as the predicted masses are over 100  mev from the observed mass . and",
    "although it would not surprise us if our predictions were off by several tens of mev we do not expect them to be off by over 100  mev .",
    "a final possibility is the @xmath115 with @xmath116  mev and @xmath117  mev with br to @xmath90 of 15% . in this case",
    "the predicted width is smaller by a factor of three so that it seems unlikely that the @xmath23 could be identified as the @xmath115 .    to summarize , with the information we currently have for the @xmath23 it is most likely either the @xmath118 or the @xmath25 or both states overlapping .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with other studies @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that it is @xmath102 with the signal for the @xmath27 final state too small to be observed with current statistics .",
    "these different possibilities can be tested by measuring br s to @xmath100 and @xmath101 final states .",
    "we also expect that it should be possible to observe the @xmath119 partners which will lie in this mass region in @xmath27 and @xmath120 final states .",
    "the key to observing missing states is that their total width is not too large and that the br s to at least some simple final states are not too small .",
    "this is how the new charm states were found by the babar and lhcb collaborations .",
    "thus , we can use our tables of charm meson properties to identify candidate states that could be observed in the near future . as",
    "the states become more massive , more and more channels open up so that the br s to easier to observe final states become smaller and smaller . for masses above around 3500",
    "mev for charm mesons the br s to simple final states are less than 1% and are likely too small to observe . for charm - strange mesons , br s to at least some simple final states remain non negligible for all states we consider due to the smaller phase space because of the larger kaon mass relative to that of the pion .",
    "another consideration is that states within multiplets will be overlapping and states in different multiplets are close enough in mass that it will require more than `` bump hunting '' to classify newly found states .",
    "determining the spin of a state and measuring br s to multiple final states will be important to disentangle the spectrum .",
    "we have already seen examples of this in the preceding sections .      for the most part , the recently observed states are the states with large br s to simple final states . for example the predicted br s of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 to the observed final state @xmath123 are 58% and 99% respectively .",
    "likewise the @xmath124 states have br s to @xmath123 ranging from 13% to 38% and the @xmath125 has a br to @xmath126 of 12% .",
    "we will use br s to simple final states to identify good candidates for discovery .",
    "we start with the @xmath124 multiplet .",
    "three of the states have been observed , the @xmath127 and @xmath128 and tentatively the @xmath129 leaving only the @xmath130 to be found .",
    "this state has a br of 38% to @xmath123 but is predicted to be rather broad , @xmath131  mev , making it potentially difficult to disentangle from the other three @xmath124 states in that mass region .",
    "this state might also be seen in the @xmath132 final state .",
    "we tentatively identified the @xmath115 state with the @xmath133 although the @xmath15 and @xmath16 are also possibilities . if we accept the @xmath115 assignment we would expect that the @xmath134 should also be seen with comparable statistics .",
    "the distinguishing feature is that the @xmath134 should be seen in both @xmath126 and @xmath123 final states .",
    "even if the @xmath133 turns out to be the @xmath15 or @xmath16 we expect that the @xmath135 states could be seen in the near future .",
    "the @xmath119 states also have relatively large br s to @xmath123 and @xmath126 final states .",
    "their masses are expected to be in the 2900 - 2950  mev mass range with widths ranging from 114 to 212  mev .",
    "in fact , some have argued that the @xmath136 can be identified with the @xmath137 .",
    "we expect that the @xmath119 multiplet can be observed in @xmath123 and @xmath126 final states .",
    "the four states are only split by 37  mev so that it will require the measurement into different final states to uniquely identify the individual states .",
    "as we pointed out previously , in addition to @xmath123 and @xmath126 , the @xmath138 final state will be a useful discriminator .",
    "other final states which would help are the @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 although in some cases they only have a sizeable br for one of the @xmath119 states . in this case",
    "their observation in one of these final states would eliminate other possibilities .",
    "the @xmath143 multiplet is next in line using this criteria for `` discoverability '' with br s to @xmath126 and @xmath123 ranging from 8 to 20% .",
    "their masses are around 3100  mev with predicted widths ranging from 126 to 270  mev .",
    "depending on the reliability of our width predictions , the two broad states , the @xmath144 and @xmath16 , are likely too broad to be easily seen .",
    "we have tentatively identified the @xmath125 with the @xmath137 state leaving the @xmath15 to be found .",
    "if found , it is expected to have a large br into @xmath138 which could be used as confirmation .",
    "the @xmath145 multiplet also has a significant br to the @xmath126 and @xmath123 final states ranging from 4% to 17% depending on the state .",
    "their masses range from around 3360 to 3400  mev and their widths range from 118 to 254  mev .",
    "the narrower widths correspond to the @xmath146 doublet and the broader widths to the @xmath147 doublet .",
    "we expect it more likely that the narrower @xmath148 and @xmath149 states will be observed first .",
    "the natural parity @xmath148 decays to both @xmath126 and @xmath123 while the un - natural @xmath149 can only decay to @xmath123 .",
    "other decay modes that can be used to distinguish between these states are @xmath138 where @xmath150 versus @xmath151 and @xmath142 where @xmath152 versus @xmath153 .",
    "one could use similar measurements to identify the @xmath154 and @xmath155 .    beyond these multiplets , the br s to @xmath126 and @xmath123",
    "final states for the most part become relatively small and other final states will become more important for finding higher excited missing states .",
    "we already suggested that the @xmath138 and @xmath142 final states would be useful for identifying excited charm states and for many of the higher excited states they have the largest br s and could prove crucial for their discovery .",
    "for example , in the @xmath156 multiplet @xmath157 but @xmath158 .",
    "the challenge is that the @xmath159 and @xmath160 will have to be reconstructed with numerous pions in the final state .",
    "similarly , @xmath161 versus @xmath162 and @xmath163 versus @xmath164 . to complete the multiplet we note that @xmath165 versus @xmath166 so that the ratio @xmath167 could be useful for discriminating between @xmath112 and @xmath109 .    one can continue this exercise by examining the predicted br s of higher mass multiplets given in tables  [ tab : d_4s1]-[tab : d_2g3 ] .",
    "further examples that satisfy the criteria of being not too broad while having a not too small br to a simple final state like @xmath126 and @xmath123 are members of the @xmath156 and @xmath168 multiplets etc .",
    "the interested reader can identify more candidate states that might be found in the near future by examining tables  [ tab : d_4s1]-[tab : d_2g3 ] .",
    "we will follow the approach used in the previous section to identify likely charm - strange discovery candidates using the criteria that states with large branching ratios to simple final states are the ones most likely to be observed .",
    "the charm - strange states that have recently been observed by belle , babar and lhcb all follow this pattern of large br s to simple states .",
    "for example , the @xmath169 identified as the @xmath170 is predicted to have @xmath171 and @xmath172 , the discovery channels .",
    "similarly the @xmath173 and @xmath174 are identified as the @xmath175 and @xmath176 which are predicted to have br s to @xmath27 , the channel studied by lhcb , of 47.3% and 57.7% respectively .",
    "finally , we tentatively identify the @xmath177 as either @xmath97 or @xmath98 whose calculated br s to @xmath90 , the babar discovery channel , are 42.9% and 24.7% respectively .",
    "the common thread is that all of the recently discovered @xmath178 have large br s to simple final states .",
    "if we extrapolate this to other excited states we can expect many more @xmath178 to be discovered in the near future .",
    "the singlet partner of the @xmath169 , the @xmath179 , is expected to lie 59  mev lower at 2650  mev with a width of 74  mev and a br of almost 100% to @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath180 partners of @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which should lie very close in mass to the @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "their widths are expected to be 115 and 195  mev respectively with br s to @xmath90 of 18.3% and 83.4% .",
    "finally , if the @xmath177 is the @xmath97 or @xmath98 there will be three other @xmath119 partner states , the @xmath183 , @xmath136 , and the other @xmath54 state . because we did not determine if the @xmath177 is the @xmath97 or @xmath98 we will make a few comments about all four of the @xmath119 states and refer to table  [ tab : ds_2p1 ] for details .",
    "all four of the @xmath119 states are close in mass ranging from 3005  mev for the @xmath136 to 3048  mev for the @xmath183 state .",
    "the widths of all four states are around 130 - 150  mev .",
    "what distinguishes them are their br s to different final states : @xmath184 decays to @xmath27 with @xmath185 but does not decay to @xmath90 , while the @xmath186 and @xmath187 decay to @xmath90 with @xmath188 and 24.7% respectively but do not decay to @xmath27 , and @xmath189 can decay to both @xmath27 and @xmath90 with br s of 6.5% and 23.4% respectively .",
    "the point is that all of these states have sizeable br s to final states that have already lead to the observation of a new state in this mass region so that we expect that the remaining three states should also be seen .",
    "so far we have only discussed charm - strange mesons that are members of multiplets with states that have already been observed .",
    "the next most promising states to find are likely to be members of the @xmath143 multiplet and in fact the @xmath15 states are alternative possibilities for the @xmath177 .",
    "we leaned towards the @xmath97 identification primarily because the predicted mass was closer to the observed mass . in any case",
    "the @xmath143 states are expected to sit around 3200  mev .",
    "the @xmath125 is predicted to have a width of 182  mev with br s to @xmath27 and @xmath90 of 15.9% and 13.6% respectively , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 have widths of 183  mev and 323  mev respectively with br s to @xmath90 of 22.6% and 28.9% respectively and do not decay to @xmath27 , and the @xmath144 is predicted to have a width of 292  mev and decays to @xmath27 and @xmath90 with br s of 15.3% and 12.9% respectively .",
    "although the br s are all sizeable , the @xmath143 states are expected to be relatively broad so it is not clear if they will be observed in the near future . however , as we have repeatedly pointed out , our width predictions can easily be off by up to a factor of two so that if they turn out to be narrower than we predict , their observation would be more likely .",
    "we note that the @xmath145 multiplet has similar br s to final states ( see table  [ tab : ds_1g1 ] ) as the @xmath143 multiplet so it might also be possible to observe these states with the same caveat regarding their large total widths .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to find these states as we would then have a series of angular momentum states stretching from @xmath190 to @xmath191 which would test the linearity of the regge trajectory and thus the linearity of the confining potential @xcite .",
    "if large deviations were found it would also provide some insights into the importance of meson loop contributions to the mass of excited states .    beyond these states",
    "there are a smattering of states that have large br s to the @xmath27 and @xmath90 final states we have focused on .",
    "a few examples are : the @xmath192 with a predicted mass of 3412  mev , width of 104  mev and br to @xmath27 of 19.5% , the @xmath193 with @xmath194  mev , @xmath195  mev and br to @xmath27 of 10% , the @xmath109 with @xmath110  mev , @xmath196  mev and br to @xmath90 of 11.4% and the @xmath112 with @xmath113  mev , @xmath197  mev and br to @xmath90 of 21.4% .",
    "one can turn to tables  [ tab : ds_3p2]-[tab : ds_2g3 ] to explore further possibilities .",
    "as more measurements are made we will be able to gauge the reliability of our predictions and those of others and refine the models to improve their predictive power .",
    "in this paper we calculated the properties of charm and charm - strange mesons using the relativized quark model to calculate masses and wavefunctions which were used to calculate radiative transition partial widths .",
    "we calculated hadronic widths using the quark pair creation model with simple harmonic oscillator wavefunctions with the oscillator parameters fitted to the rms radius of the relativized quark model wavefunctions .",
    "we used our results to identify recently observed charm and charm - strange mesons in terms of quark model spectroscopic states .",
    "our results support the previously made assignment of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 as the @xmath198 and @xmath199 states respectively .",
    "we identify the @xmath5 and @xmath200 as the @xmath201 and @xmath202 respectively and tentatively identify the @xmath7 as the @xmath203 state . in the latter case",
    "further measurements are needed to strengthen the assignment .",
    "we suggested that measurements of br s to @xmath138 and @xmath123 would be useful .",
    "we tentatively identified the @xmath204 as the @xmath205 state and favour the @xmath13 to be the @xmath206 although we do not rule out the @xmath15 and @xmath16 assignments .",
    "for the recently observed charm - strange mesons we identify the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 as the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 respectively and suggest that the @xmath23 is most likely the @xmath118 or @xmath25 although it might be the @xmath26 with the @xmath27 final state too small to be observed with current statistics .",
