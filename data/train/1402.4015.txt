    "the properties of a single impurity that interacts strongly with a background gas , for example , can be addressed with ultracold atoms .",
    "the so - called fermi polaron problem refers to a single spin - down impurity that is coupled to a non - interacting spin - up fermi sea ( fs ) .",
    "this problem corresponds to the extreme limit of spin imbalance in a two - component fermi gas  @xcite and has implications on the phase diagram of the strongly spin - polarized fermi gas  @xcite . at weak attraction ,",
    "one expects a  polaron \" state  @xcite , in which the impurity is dressed with density fluctuations of the spin - up fermi gas .",
    "recent experiments have observed indications of a transition from this polaronic state to a molecular state ( a two - body bound state of the impurity and an atom of the sea ) upon increasing the attraction strength in three dimensions ( 3d )  @xcite and in two dimensions ( 2d )  @xcite .",

    "surprisingly , this is also the situation for strong correlations  @xcite .    in this work we focus on the 2d fermi polaron for attractive interactions and study the role of multiple particle - hole ( mp - h ) excitations for the ground - state properties of the system .",

    "there are two dominant diagrams at each given order that emerge next to many diagrams with a much smaller contribution  @xcite .",
    "these dominant diagrams contribute almost equally but have opposite sign . in 2d , however , the numerical calculations indicate that at a given order the very same two diagrams dominate , but to a lesser extent ; that is , the nondominant diagrams have a larger weight in the final 2d result . by",

    "we stress that this is not true for a fermi system with two interacting components with finite density  @xcite . in 2d",
    "the total weight of a given order ( i.e. , the sum of the absolute values of the contributions of diagrams ) is distributed over more diagrams than in 3d . because the sign alternation occurs over a broader distribution of the weights , we get more statistical noise in sampling the self - energy in 2d compared to 3d . in 3d",
    "we can evaluate the diagrammatic series for the one - body self - energy accurately up to order @xmath74 , whereas in 2d we can reach order @xmath75 .    in principle , other choices for the propagators ( `` bare '' versus `` dressed '' propagators ) are possible , and this was discussed in detail for the 3d fermi polaron in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "replacing the bare propagators by dressed ones reduces the number of diagrams at each given order .",
    "one may expect that this replacement could allow one to reach higher orders . for the 3d polaron ,",

    "<S> we study the properties of the two - dimensional fermi polaron model in which an impurity attractively interacts with a fermi sea of particles in the zero - range limit . </S>",
    "<S> we use a diagrammatic monte carlo ( diagmc ) method which allows us to sample a feynman diagrammatic series to very high order . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence properties of the series and the role of multiple particle - hole excitations are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we study the polaron and molecule energy as a function of the coupling strength , revealing a transition from a polaron to a molecule in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we find a value for the critical interaction strength which complies with the experimentally measured one and predictions from variational methods . </S>",
    "<S> for all considered interaction strengths , the polaron @xmath0 factor from the full diagrammatic series almost coincides with the one - particle - hole result . </S>",
    "<S> we also formally link the diagmc and the variational approaches for the polaron problem at hand . </S>"
