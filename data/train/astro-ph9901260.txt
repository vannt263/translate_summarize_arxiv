    "starburst galaxies contain hundreds to thousands of the most massive o type stars and their wolf - rayet descendants ( see other articles in this volume ) .",
    "massive stars are generally concentrated in clusters with typical diameters of @xmath31020 pc .",
    "the duration of the starburst events in low - mass galaxies is thought to be 10 myr or less , so that the duty cycle of massive star formation over the lifetime of the galaxy is small ( dohm - palmer  1998 ) . in normal galaxies , these massive star clusters",
    "dominate the production of ionizing photons , the generation of mechanical energy input to the ism , and the nucleosynthesis of @xmath4-process elements ( e.g. , o , ne , s , si ) .",
    "understanding the fate of these heavy elements after they are ejected by stellar winds and supernovae explosions is part of the larger objective to trace the life cycles of matter in the universe .",
    "the impact of massive star evolution on a host galaxy is best studied in low - mass systems where the effect is most pronounced .",
    "low - mass galaxies encompass a wide variety of objects with nomenclatures including blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcdg ) , h  ii galaxies , dwarf elliptical galaxies ( de ) , irregular ( irr ) , and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies . because low - mass galaxies are also relatively metal - deficient ( lequeux  1979 ; skillman 1989 ) , the heavy element yield of a given number of massive stars has a relatively large impact on the chemical properties of the surrounding gas .",
    "the chemical composition of the stars and gas in low mass galaxies may be measured by optical spectroscopy of emission lines from prominent h  ii regions ( warm ionized gas ) , absorption lines in stellar atmospheres ( stars ) , or x - ray spectroscopy of emission lines from highly ionized atomic species ( hot diffuse gas ) . here",
    "i consider only abundance measurements of the warm photo - ionized gas in and around h  ii regions .",
    "since oxygen is the most easily measured element in h  ii regions , the terms `` abundance '' or `` metallicity '' should be read here as the `` abundance of oxygen relative to hydrogen by number . ''    assessing the impact of massive stars on the chemical content of their host galaxies entails two distinct issues : 1 ) do galaxies with large populations of evolved massive stars ( i.e. , wolf - rayet galaxies ) show , as a group , signatures of chemical enrichment from the current generation of star formation ? 2 ) are there _ localized _ chemical fluctuations on spatial scales comparable to individual giant h  ii regions that might be due to heavy elements recently synthesized and released by massive stars ( e.g. , `` self - enrichment''kunth & sargent 1986 ;  local contaminationpagel ,",
    "terlevich , & melnick 1986 ) ? since chemical abundances are like fossils that record the previous star formation activity , both types of elemental variations contain information about the star formation and gas dynamical history of the host galaxy .",
    "galaxies with large populations of evolved massive stars in the wolf - rayet phase are sometimes termed wolf - rayet galaxies ( see contribution in this volume by p. conti ) .",
    "there are presently no quantitative criteria by which objects are granted this distinction , and it has now become clear that the wolf - rayet phase is a normal episode in the evolution of starburst galaxies .",
    "wolf - rayet stars are observed in nearly all galaxies , including the milky way , the magellanic clouds , and even the extremely metal - deficient i  zw  18 ( izotov  1997 ; legrand  1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless , some galaxies show prominent wolf - rayet features in their integrated optical spectra , indicating a large fraction of stars in the wolf - rayet phase .",
    "some authors postulate that the interstellar gas in such galaxies may become `` contaminated '' by nitrogen - rich and helium - rich winds of the evolved stars ( pagel , terlevich , & melnick 1986 ) . for this reason ,",
    "such galaxies are often omitted from studies seeking to use the chemical properties of low - mass galaxies to measure the primordial helium abundance and other fundamental cosmological parameters ( pagel  1992 ; olive & steigman 1995 ) .",
    "i have collected from the literature and self - consistently analyzed the oxygen , nitrogen , and helium abundances from nearly 100 low - mass galaxies , as compiled in kobulnicky & skillman ( 1996 ) .",
    "figure  1 and figure  2 show the resulting chemical abundances .",
    "filled circles distinguish galaxies with strong wolf - rayet features from galaxies without strong wolf - rayet features ( open circles ) .",
    "a comparison of the two galaxy samples reveals no significant difference between their mean nitrogen abundances .",
    "likewise , the mean helium abundances for the two samples are also consistent with one another .",
    "this result shows that , as a class , galaxies with strong wolf - rayet features from evolved massive stellar populations do not exhibit anomalous chemical properties compared to other star - forming galaxies .",
    "this result does not mean that evolved massive starbursts do not contribute heavy elements to the surrounding interstellar medium ; we may only infer that the presence of strong wolf - rayet features alone is not sufficient to distinguish galaxies which may have recently experienced an episode of chemical enrichment .",
    "clusters of massive stars are , in theory , capable of creating large localized chemical enrichments ( esteban & peimbert 1995 ) .",
    "a typical 40 @xmath5 star may yield 26 @xmath5 of oxygen and several @xmath6 of nitrogen .",
    "individual wolf - rayet nebulae and supernova remnants exhibit pronounced concentrations of fresh nucleosynthesis products . yet , on the scale of giant h  ii regions near massive star clusters in ngc  4214 ( kobulnicky & skillman 1996 ) and ngc  1569 ( kobulnicky & skillman 1997 ; devost , roy & drissen 1997 ) , ngc 2636 ( roy  1996 ) , and the smc ( pagel  1978 ; russel & dopita 1990 ) no measurable o , n , or he anomalies are seen in the surrounding warm photoionized medium . a quantitative comparison of expected chemical pollution versus observed abundance fluctuations",
    "is shown in figure  3 for the case of the super star cluster a in ngc  1569 .",
    "the measured n / o ratio along a 45  strip adjoining the star cluster is plotted .",
    "the n / o ratio is a particularly robust measure of potential abundance fluctuations because it is relatively insensitive to errors in the adopted electron temperature . in figure  3 , no substantial variations beyond the measurement uncertainties are evident despite a sensitivity to n or o yields of just a few massive stars .",
    "for example , the slightly - elevated n / o ratio seen at the position number 12 at the 35@xmath7 mark could be caused by as few as two 40 m@xmath8 stars .",
    "ngc  5253 ( welch 1970 ; walsh & roy 1989 ; kobulnicky  1997 ) and possibly markarian 996 ( thuan , isotov , & lipovetsky 1996 ) remain the only galaxies where strong localized abundance anomalies are present .",
    "ngc 5253 contains a central starburst region ( figure  4 ) overabundant in nitrogen by a factor of 3 compared to the surrounding ism .",
    "the nitrogen overabundant region appears to be @xmath360 pc in diameter and is centered on the heavily obscured starcluster to the nw of aperture h  ii-1 .",
    "schaerer  ( 1997 ) detect wolf - rayet features near this location .",
    "one hypothesis is that 610 wolf rayet stars have `` polluted '' this area with their nitrogen - rich winds .",
    "the n enrichment is equivalent to the nitrogen yield of @xmath38 wolf - rayet stars , or @xmath3120 type i planetary nebulae .",
    "however , the lack of he enrichment at the same locations ( kobulnicky  1997 ) is difficult to understand since localized enrichment by wolf - rayet winds should produce elevations of both elements .",
    "ground - based spectra ( walsh & roy 1989 ) do show an he overabundance along with the n overabundance , lending credence to the wolf - rayet star scenario .",
    "can the lack of observed enrichment be due to rapid dispersal and dilution of the heavy elements ? not likely .",
    "assuming an age of 10 myr for cluster a , homogeneous dispersal within a sphere of a given radius , a filling factor for the ionized gas of 0.1 , a gas density of 100 @xmath9 , an imf slope of -2.7 in the range 0.5100 m@xmath8 ( see kobulnicky & skillman 1997 for details ) , the expected n / o deviations for a variety of dispersal scales are shown with solid lines in figure  3 . adopting any combination of inhomogeneous dispersal , higher cluster age , lower",
    "filling factor or lower average gas density will enhance the expected chemical variations .",
    "given typical expansion speeds of supernova ejecta , the heavy elements _ could _ be dispersed through a larger region than the largest simulated volume , and thereby become undetectable .",
    "however , such an extreme rapid  dilution scenario requires a finely  tuned , ad hoc dispersal mechanism to maintain the appearance of homogeneity of scales of several hundred pc .",
    "i  zw  18 provides an extreme test of the rapid dispersal hypothesis . in a small metal - poor galaxy like i  zw  18",
    ", even two o stars can produce significant chemical enrichment . yet , both starburst knots in i  zw  18 , separated by 300 pc , show identical chemical properties ( skillman & kennicutt 1993 ) .",
    "it seems that the heavy elements produced by the massive stars ( down to 20 m@xmath8 ) in cluster a in ngc  1569 are evidently not seen in the warm ionized medium .",
    "on scales of 10 pc to over 1 kpc , low - mass galaxies appear chemically homogeneous , indicating that the heavy elements are well dispersed throughout the warm ionized phase of the interstellar medium .",
    "the heavy elements are not necessarily well - mixed , however , as concentrations of massive star ejecta may exist on small , sub pc scales , or they may be incorporated into a phase of the ism other than the warm , @xmath310,000 k photoionized medium . given the lack of visible chemical enrichment around major starbursts , several explanations could be considered .",
    "_ 1 ) perhaps the metals were never produced / released in the first place .",
    "_ if the number of massive stars originally present in the cluster has been overestimated based on the remaining stellar content , then the expected mass of heavy elements would be reduced .",
    "an abnormally low upper mass cutoff in the imf , or an abnormally steep imf could work to accomplish the observed effect .",
    "yet , ngc  4214 and ngc  1569 do contain wolf - rayet stars , so clearly the most massive stars have been , and are still present in the bursts .",
    "_ 2 ) an alternative suggestion requires that black holes left by supernovae from massive stars to engulf the metals produced by the progenitor ( e.g. , maeder 1992 ) .",
    "_ this idea merits further theoretical investigation , but unless the lower mass limit for black hole formation , m@xmath10 is considerably lower than @xmath350 m@xmath8 , then the reduction of chemical yields would be too minor to resolve this problem .",
    "see discussion elsewhere in this volume for current estimates of m@xmath10 .",
    "_ 3 ) the last , and most probable explanation for missing metals requires that the freshly - ejected metals reside in a hard - to - observe hot or cold phase ( e.g. , tenorio - tagle 1996 ) . _ since supernovae and the superbubbles formed by concerted supernovae contain copious x - ray emitting material , hot gas is the preferred explanation .",
    "the cas a supernova remnant , for example , contains between 4 m@xmath8 ( vink , kaastra , & bleeker 1996 ) and 15 m@xmath8 ( jansen , smith , & bleeker 1989 ) of x - ray emitting material , consistent with the amount of ejecta expected from the progenitor .",
    "the pending generation of x - ray observatories should be able to measure the mass and metallicity of hot gas surrounding massive star clusters and make a direct comparison to expectations based on starburst models .",
    "i thank the organizing committee for the invitation to present this talk .",
    "i am especially grateful to peter conti for a timely 1992 colloquium at the university of minnesota which inspired much of this work .",
