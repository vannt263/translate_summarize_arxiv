    "the mean field game ( mfg in short ) theory has been introduced in @xcite to describe the limit behavior of differential games when the number of agents becomes very large .",
    "models based on this theory can be used to investigate crowd dynamics , consensus formation and various economical and social problems ( as growth theory , environmental policy and formation of volatility in financial markets ) in which the strategy of the single agent determines a collective behavior of the population ( see @xcite ) .    from a mathematical point of view , mfg theory leads to the study of a coupled system of two differential equations : a hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation and a fokker - planck equation , describing respectively the optimal behavior of each single agent and the evolution of the whole population .",
    "there is a rapidly increasing literature concerning both the theoretical aspects and the applications of mfg ( see the review paper @xcite ) .",
    "a crucial point to extend the theory of mfg systems to networks is to find the appropriate transition conditions at the vertices in order to obtain a well posed mathematical problem , coherent with the applications . in @xcite , it was considered a mfg system with quadratic hamiltonian which , by an appropriate change of variable , can be transformed into a linear system of differential equations coupled only via the initial datum . a general class of stationary mfg systems on networks",

    "is also used in the discretization of the fokker - planck equation and of the corresponding transition condition . by means of the previous identities we prove the well - posedness of the discrete problem and the convergence to the solution of the system .    * while there is a large literature about the approximation of hyperbolic problems on networks ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) , as far as we know , numerical schemes for second order differential equations on networks with kirchhoff conditions have been only considered in the linear case ( see @xcite , @xcite)*. hence the part concerning the approximation of the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation on the network is new and of independent interest .",
