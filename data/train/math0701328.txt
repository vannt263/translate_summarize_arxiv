    "large attention has been given recently in the physical and mathematical literature to stochastic systems perturbed by dichotomous noise , such as those related to brownian motion or brownian motors ( see , for instance , bena _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , @xcite and porr _ et al . _",
    "the relevance of markovian dichotomous noise in biological systems has been also pointed out .",
    "see , for instance , laing and longtin @xcite where the benefic role of noise is investigated within the context of mathematical neuroscience . in this paper",
    "we aim to study the effect of dichotomous noise to the hazard rate function of random lifetimes .",
    "it is well known that in many fields related to survival analysis and reliability theory the study of hazard rates plays a very important role ( see the classical book of barlow and proschan @xcite , for instance ) . specifically , here we are interested to hazard rate functions that are realizations of stochastic processes",
    ". such types of hazard rates arise in some models that were recently proposed to describe doubly random phenomena such as lifetimes of devices operating in random environments .",
    "see , for instance , kebir @xcite and the included references for a model in which the hazard rate is a functional of a stochastic process that describes the random variability of the environment .",
    "a similar model is treated in di crescenzo and pellerey @xcite , where the hazard function is the realization of a non - decreasing stochastic process with independent increments .",
    "other models characterized by stochastic hazard rate functions were also discussed by ov and jadrenko @xcite and by yadrenko and zhegri  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a stochastic model in which a constant hazard rate ( describing the fractional dissolution rate of a drug potion ) is corrupted by a white noise was recently analyzed by lnsk and lnsk @xcite and by lnsk and weiss @xcite within the theory of drug dissolution .",
    "other applications of stochastic hazard rates were proposed in the actuarial literature and in studies of population biology and human aging ( see milevsky and promislow @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all these stochastic models are suitable to describe phenomena characterized by an intrinsic randomness , which is evidenced at the hazard rate level .    along the line traced by the above mentioned papers ,",
    "herewith we propose a new model to describe systems characterized by failure rates which are subject to random perturbations expressed as dichotomous noise .",
    "we aim to discuss a model that incorporates a more realistic kind of noise characterized by a constant intensity , and that at the same time presents the feature of noise with alternating behavior that is frequently found in biological systems .",

    "we point out that the results obtained in this paper can be extended to the case where there are two different values @xmath12 and @xmath13 is an alternating poisson process characterized by two rates @xmath14 and @xmath15 . finally , we point out that stochastic processes obtained by transformations of the integrated telegraph process are of interest in stochastic modelling literature .",
