    "the fitness landscape was introduced as a metaphor for adaptation . informally , the surface of the landscape consists of genotypes , where similar genotypes are close to each other , and the fitness of a genotype is represented as a height coordinate .",
    "adaptation can then be pictured as an uphill walk in the fitness landscape @xcite .",
    "it is frequently claimed that we know virtually nothing about fitness landscapes in nature .",
    "scarcity of fitness measurements along with the difficulty in measuring fitness , are cited as reasons .",
    "the purpose of this work is to demonstrate that available records of drug resistance mutations can reveal interesting properties of the underlying fitness landscapes .",
    "we suggest qualitative tools that are easy to apply and interpret in order to learn properties of fitness landscapes from data .",
    "the setting we have in mind is a record of clinically found antimicrobial drug resistance mutations , where there is a well defined wild - type and several mutant variants with some degree of drug resistance .",
    "other cases of adaptation could work as well .",
    "there are several advantages with mutation records as a source of information .",
    "the records are already available .",
    "the quantity of data is substantial and growing , and the quality tend to be high since the data is of medical importance .",
    "moreover , the data reflects nature , whereas laboratory data sometimes disagree with clinical observations , see our discussion about the tem - family below .",
    "however , the most important reason is that this data reflects adaptation .",
    "in contrast , many times empirical studies where fitness is measured consider combinations of deleterious mutations",
    ". the majority of such combinations are probably exceedingly rare in nature .",
    "if one is interested in adaptation , one needs knowledge about beneficial mutations as well . for an overview of recent empirical work where fitness is measured ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite and references .",
    "most existing studies concern few loci ( 4 or 5 ) and a specific selective environmnet . for studies with many loci , see e.g. @xcite , and for a case where fitness ranks for the same genotypes are determined in several different selective environments , see @xcite .",
    "we apply our results to the tem family of beta - lactamases associated with antibiotic resistance .",
    "tem stands for temoneira , the name of the patient from whom the enzyme was first isolated .",
    "tem beta - lactamases have been found in _",
    "escherichia coli _ ,",
    "_ klebsiella pneumoniae _ and other gram - negative bacteria .",
    "tem-1 is considered the wild - type .",
    "the length of tem-1 is 287 , i.e. , tem-1 can be represented as a sequence of 287 letters in the 20-letter alphabeth corresponding to the amino acids .",
    "over 170 tem variants have been found clinically , where 41 are single mutants , i.e. , they have exactly one amino acid substitution , and the the majority ( 90 % ) have at most 4 amino acid substitutions .",
    "we use the record of the tem family from the lahey clinic    http://www.lahey.org/studies/temtable.asp .    the quality of the tem record ( from now on we will simply refer to `` the tem record '' ) ,",
    "is assumed to be high the tem record represent a case of multiple environments , but probably not an exessive amount of completely different environments .",
    "several antibiotics have similar effects .",
    "we have good reason to believe that the tem record is fairly complete , and that there is not an abundance of neutral mutations .    as a complement , we use laboratory results @xcite .",
    "our study determines if tem data is compatible with classical models of fitness landscapes .",
    "more precisely , we compare with additive , uncorrelated and block models of fitness landscapes . the nk model is also dicussed .    throughout our article ,",
    "our focus is to what extent beneficial mutations combine well .",
    "we start with a brief description of our approach in the context of the tem family . using standard notation ,",
    "tem-2 is a single mutant with the mutation q39k , which means that the amino acid denoted `` q '' ( glutamine ) at position 39 of the wild - type is substituted by the amino acid denoted `` k '' ( lysine ) .",
    "tem-174 is the single mutant a213v .",
    "one can ask if the double mutant with substitutions q39k and a213v confer antibiotic resistance , since the double mutant combines two resistance mutations .",
    "however , the double mutant does not occur in the record .",
    "roughly , we compare the candidates for double mutants , such as the one described , with double mutants that do occur in the record , and consider the patterns for how candidates occur of are absent in the record .",
    "this approach is motivated by an evolutionary perspective .",
    "provided that the quality of a record of resistance mutations is good , most single mutants are more fit , i.e. , confer more drug resistance than the wild - type in som environment .",
    "likewise , if a double mutant occur in a mutation record , it is plausible that the double mutant is more fit than at least one of the corresponding single mutants in some environment .",
    "put briefly , we consider if `` good+good = better '' for mutations .",
    "the goal is to capture the relation between fitness landscapes and mutation records .",
    "one reason for being interested in mutation records , is that laboratory results do not always reflect clinical facts .",
    "a striking example is that the triple mutant of the tem family with substitutions a42 g , e104k , and g238s , confer a high degree of cefotaxime resistance according to laboratory results @xcite , but this mutant has never been observed clinically .",
    "examples where single mutants not found outside of the laboratory confer a high degree of cefotaxime resistance are given in @xcite",
    ".    it may seem surprising qualitative information can be useful for analyzing fitness landscapes . however , we will show that predictions from some classical models relate well to qualitative information .",
    "our approach could be useful for comparisons of empirical landscapes , and there is a potential for relating the information derived directly to recombination strategies .",
    "we define fitness as the expected reproductive success , and use the convention that the wild - type has fitness 1 .",
    "fitness is called _ additive _ if the fitness effects of mutations sum . consider a biallelic two - loci system .",
    "suppose that the genotype ab has fitness 1 , the genotype ab has fitness 1.03 and the genotype ab has fitness 1.01 . if fitness is additive , then the genotype ab has fitness @xmath1 ( in the literature non - epistatic fitness is sometimes defined as multiplicative , so that the double mutant would have fitness 1.0403 .",
    "if the fitness effects and the number of beneficial mutations are small , there is not much difference between the definitions . )",
    "values greater than 1.04 implies positive epistasis .",
    "values smaller than 1.04 implies negative epistasis .",
    "_ sign epistasis _",
    "means that a particular mutation is beneficial or deleterious depending on genetic background .",
    "for example , if ab , ab , ab and have fitness values as above ( 1 , 1.03 , 1.01 ) , but ab has fitness 1.02 , then there is sign epistasis .",
    "indeed , in this case the mutation b is beneficial for the ab - genotype , and deleterious for the ab - genotype .",
    "the concept of a fitness landscapes has been formalized in different ways .",
    "a genotype may be represented as a string in the 20 , 4 or 2 letter alphabet , depending on if one considers the amino acids , the base pairs or biallelic systems .",
    "thorughout the paper , we will consider amino acids .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the 20 letter alphabeth .",
    "the _ genotype space _ @xmath3 consists of all @xmath4 strings of length @xmath5 .",
    "a _ fitness landscape _",
    "@xmath6 assigns a fitness value to each genotype .",
    "the fitness of a genotype @xmath7 is denoted @xmath8 .",
    "if two genotypes differ by a single mutation , they are _",
    "mutational neighbors_.    [ og ] following the orr - gillespie approach we assume that the wild - type has very high fitness also in the new environment as compared to a randomly generated genotype . consequently , only a small number of mutations of the wild - type are beneficial .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 1.1",
    "we briefly review classical models of fitness landscapes .",
    "section 2 provides basic observations of the tem record .",
    "section 3 concerns additive and uncorrelated fitness , and section 4 block models . for all models ,",
    "we compare with the tem record , and in section 5 a laborator study of tem alleles is used as a complement to the record .",
    "additive fitness landscapes , uncorrelated fitness landscapes , the block model and kauffman s nk model have had a broad influence in evolutionary biology",
    ". we will give a brief overview of the four classical models .",
    "additive fitness landscapes , or non - epistatic landscape , has been defined .",
    "an additive fitness landscape is single peaked .",
    "in contrast , for an uncorrelated ( also called random , rugged or house of cards [ hoc ] ) fitness landscape , there is no correlation between the fitness of a genotype and the fitness of its mutational neighbors , i.e. , alleles that differ by one substitution only .    consider an uncorrelated landscapes where say @xmath9 of the single mutants are more fit than the wild - type .",
    "it follows that for double mutants corresponding to two beneficial single mutations , approximately @xmath9 are more fit than the wild - type as well . in other words ,",
    "beneficial mutations do usually not combine well for an uncorrelated fitness landscape by remark [ og ] .",
    "uncorrelated fitness and additivity can be considered as two extremes with regard to the amount of structure in the fitness landscape , and most fitness landscape fall between the extremes .",
    "uncorrelated fitness has been studied extensively in the literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the block model ( see ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) ) the string representing a genotype can be subdivided into blocks , where each block makes an independent contribution to the fitness of the string .",
    "each block has uncorrelated fitness , and the fitness of the string is the sum of contributions from each block .",
    "in particular , a block model consisting of only one block only is an uncorrelated fitness landscape . the rational behind this model",
    "is that if two blocks have completely different functions , then the effect of two changes in different blocks should be independent .",
    "kaufmann s nk model ( see e. g. @xcite ) is defined so that the epistatic effects are random , whereas the fitness of a genotype is the average of the `` contributions '' from each locus .",
    "more precisely , for the nk model the genotypes have length n ( in our notation @xmath10 ) , and the parameter @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , reflects interactions between loci .",
    "the fitness contribution @xmath13 from the locus @xmath14 is determined by its state @xmath15 and the states at @xmath11 other loci @xmath16 .",
    "the key assumption is that this contribution is assigned at random from some probability distribution .",
    "the fitness of a genotype @xmath7 is the average of the contributions @xmath13 , so that @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "several important properties of nk landscapes depend mainly on n and k , rather than the exact structure of the epistatic interactions .",
    "the fact that the fitness of the genotype is the average of these @xmath19 contributions , means that fitness effects of non - interacting mutations sum .",
    "notice that the fitness landscapes is additive for @xmath20 and uncorrelated for @xmath21 .",
    "the popularity of the nk model rests on the that the model is `` tunably rugged '' .",
    "this expression means that the ruggedness is expected to increase by @xmath11 from the single peaked additive landscape for @xmath20 to the uncorrelated landscape with a maximal number of peaks for @xmath21 .",
    "published results on the nk model of ( potential ) relevance to evolutionary biology concerns the number of peaks , the length of mutational trajectories , fitness distributions of genotypes and fitness trajectories .",
    "notice that also the block model includes additive landscapes and uncorrelated landscapes as special cases .",
    "more importantly , nk models and block models are similar in that there is a sharp division between effects which are completely random and effects which are additive .",
    "one should keep in mind that the block models and kaufman s nk model are equipped with very special structures . in order to provide some intuition for how empirical landscapes relate to the models",
    ", we will consider examples .",
    "@xmath22 for every loci , replacing 0 by 1 increases fitness by @xmath23 .",
    "fitness is additive and the genotype @xmath24 is at a peak .",
    "@xmath25    for every loci , replacing 0 by 1 increases fitness . for the first locus",
    "the increase is @xmath26 , regardless of background . for the other loci ,",
    "the magnitude of the difference depends on the background .",
    "for instance , the magnitude is 0.02 for the change from 0000 to 0001 , 0.01 for the change from 0001 to 0011 , and 0.005 for the change from 0011 to 0111 .",
    "fitness is obviously not additive in the second example , since the fitness of the double and triple mutants are below linear expectations based on the wild - type and the single mutants .",
    "the landscape deviates from expectations for an uncorrelated landscape as well , since replacing 0 by 1 always gives higher fitness .",
    "it remains to consider the more general models .",
    "as for the block model , the first locus is independent , the remaining three loci interact with each other in a symmetric way .",
    "consequently , the natural candidates for blocks would be one block consisting of the first locus , and another block consisting of the remaining three loci .",
    "however , the second block deviates considerably from random expectations .",
    "consequently , the block model is not a good fit .    for the nk model ,",
    "the independent fitness contribution for the first loci suggest that @xmath20 . however , the second locus depends on the third and the fourth loci , suggesting that @xmath27 .",
    "( similar arguments for the third and the fourth loci , suggests that @xmath27 as well . )",
    "since the observations suggest different @xmath11-values , the nk model does not seem ideal .",
    "[ sym ] the nk model allows different interactive patterns .",
    "however , it is not expected that some loci are more or less independent , whereas other loci have considerable interactions",
    ". some degree of of symmetry is expected , reflecting the @xmath11 value .",
    "several other models for fitness landscapes have been suggested , including neutral models , see @xcite for an empirical perspective .",
    "for some approaches to fitness landscapes not related to the models mentioned , see the geometric theory of gene interactions @xcite , and the orr - gillespie theory @xcite .",
    "notice also that fitness landscapes have been used in chemistry , physics and computer science , in addition to evolutionary biology . in combinatorial optimization the fitness function",
    "is referred to as the cost function . for a survey on combinatorial landscapes in general",
    "see @xcite .",
    "throughout the paper , we focus on single and double mutants in a record .",
    "the motivation is trivial .",
    "if a single mutant has high fitness , it is likely to be found in nature .",
    "however , if a @xmath28-tuple mutant is very fit for some large @xmath28 , the mutant may never be found because of the time span necessary before the substitutions have accumulated .",
    "single and double mutants are likely to appear relatively early in the process of adaptation . roughly , we are interested in the proportion of beneficial mutations among all possible single mutations , as well as to what extent beneficial mutations combine well .",
    "the information we consider is coarse , and a record of mutation will rarely be perfect .",
    "as indicated , we will work with words in the 20 letter alphabet where there is a well defined wild - type .",
    "a single mutant is a genotype resulting from one amino acid substitution .",
    "however , the amino acid substitutions are not comparable to substitutions of letters in a string",
    ". not every amino acid substitution can occur as the result of a single point mutation .",
    "for instance , suppose that the amino acid is valine at a particular locus , and that the codon is gtt .",
    "then one can obtain exactly 6 single mutants at the locus corresponding to a , d , f , g , i , l ( or alanin , aspartic acid , phenylalanine , glysine isoleucine , leucine ) .",
    "on the other hand , one can obtain exactly 8 single mutants ( a , d , e , f , g , i , l , m ) starting from valine ( the codons for valine are gtt , gtc , gta , gtg ) .    in general , the number of single mutants one can obtain varies depending on amino acid .",
    "moreover , in some cases , such as for valine , the number depends on if one consider a particular codon for the amino acid or all possible codons .    to make matters more complicated",
    ", the wild - type allele under consideration may be unique in terms of amino acids , but not in terms of codons . for a precise analysis",
    ", one may want to consider codon variations in the wild - type allele .",
    "however , for our purposes it is sufficient to consider amino acids .",
    "we assume that there are approximately 7 possible single point mutations for a given locus , so that if the wild - type has length @xmath19 , there are @xmath29 mutational neighbors . for the reader s convenience",
    ", we included a table of possible single mutants ( see section 7 ) .",
    "[ sex ] throughout the paper , we assume a genotype of length @xmath19 has @xmath29 mutational neighbors .",
    "we are interested in the proportion of beneficial mutations among all possible mutations . by remark [ og ] , the proportion of beneficial mutations is expected to be small . for the tem record @xmath30 and there are 47 single mutants in the record . consequently , @xmath31    another interesting property of a fitness landscape , is how beneficial mutations combine .",
    "more precisely , consider a double mutant which combines two beneficial single mutations .",
    "if the double mutant is less fit than both single mutants , then the double mutant would most likely not appear in the record .",
    "the qualitative measure of additivity is motivated by this observation .",
    "more precisely , we will use the following definition .",
    "let @xmath32 be the set consisting of all double mutants such that both corresponding single mutations are beneficial .",
    "the set @xmath33 consists of all double mutants in @xmath32 which are more fit than at least one of the corresponding single mutants .",
    "the qualitative measure of additivity for a fitness landscape is the ratio @xmath34 .",
    "consider the single mutations in a record and the corresponding double mutants .",
    "whenever two single mutants at different sites occur in the record , the corresponding double mutant is considered a candidate for a double mutant of high fitness .",
    "let @xmath35 be the set of candidates for double mutants .",
    "let @xmath36 be the set of double mutants in the record among the candidates .",
    "loosely speaking , one can consider @xmath37 the observed qualitative measure of additivity . under ideal circumstances ,",
    "the ratios @xmath37 and @xmath34 are approximately the same , at least in for antimicrobial resistance mutations in the context we consider .",
    "we assume that the adaptation , or the resistance development , will take place repeatedly at different geographic locations .",
    "if a double mutant is more fit than at least one of the single mutants , the double mutant should occur sooner or later .",
    "if fitness is additive , then @xmath34=1 , and for uncorrelated fitness one expects the value be close to 0 by remark [ og ] . of course the measure is coarse .",
    "however , it is valuable to have a simple method for comparing fitness landscapes in different contexts . whenever fitness is measured",
    ", one can determine @xmath34 , and for any record one can determine @xmath37 .",
    "notice that one expects the qualitative measure to decrease by increasing block size for the block model , as well as by increasing @xmath11 for the nk model .",
    "for some background , a measure of additivity which reflects quantitative fitness differences is called `` roughness '' @xcite .",
    "roughness 0 implies that the landscape is additive .",
    "a problem with roughness is a possible size bias , i.e. , all else equal , the roughness may be greater for a large number of loci .",
    "the qualitative measure of additivity does not have any size bias .",
    "analyzing epistasis is closely related to analyzing additivity . for a thorough discussion about different measures of epistasis and empirical fitness landscapes ,",
    "see @xcite . the most fine - scaled approach to epistasis is the geometric theory of gene interactions , which uses triangulations of polytopes @xcite .",
    "we will consider the @xmath37 value for the tem record .",
    "the record has 46 single mutants .",
    "the substitutions are at position position 69 for 3 single mutants , at position 164 for 3 single mutants , at position 244 for 5 single mutants and at position 275 for 2 single mutants .",
    "each remaining single mutant has its mutation at a unique position .",
    "it follows that the number of candidates are @xmath38    the record has 35 double mutants in the set @xmath39 ( see table 1 for a list of the double mutants in the set @xmath39 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath40    we summarize the results for the tem record in the following observation .    for the tem record ,    1 .",
    "the proportion of beneficial single mutations is @xmath41 , 2 .",
    "the ratio @xmath42 consequently , @xmath43 is an estimate of the qualitative measure of additivity @xmath44 .",

    "we first consider conditions ideal for our purposes .",
    "then we discuss the consequences of relaxing some of the conditions .",

    "if one restricts to the category of double mutants where both corresponding single mutants are more fit than the wild - type , the proportion is @xmath49 as well .",
    "fitness being uncorrelated , one third of the double mutants in this category are expected to be less fit than both single mutants .",

    "_ multiple environments and additive landscapes .",
    "_ in contrast to the single environment case , even if the fitness landscape associated with each drug is additive the @xmath37-value may be lower than 1 .",

    "the position graphs considers loci , but not the amino acid substitution .",
    "one may want to look at more - fine scaled information and distinguish between different substitutions at the same site .",
    "recall that the _ degree _ of a node is the number of edges to other nodes .",
    "the complement @xmath61 of a graph @xmath62 is a graph on the same nodes , where a pair of nodes are connected by an edge exactly if the pair is not connected by an edge for @xmath62 . for a _ complete bipartite graph _",
    ", the nodes can be partitioned into two subsets , such that every pair of nodes from different subsets are connected by an edge , and there are no other edges .",
    "the following observation is elementary by remark [ og ] .",
    "assume the block model ( with at least two blocks ) .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the position graph .",
    "consider @xmath62 and the complement @xmath61 . under the perfect record assumptions , the nodes of @xmath62 have degree one or more .",
    "moreover , by remark [ og ] , the following statements hold modulo a few errors :    1 .   for the case of two blocks ,",
    "@xmath62 is a complete bipartite graph .",
    "it follows that @xmath61 is a disconnected graph with two components , both of which are complete .",
    "2 .   in general , for @xmath63 blocks , @xmath61 is a disconnected graph with @xmath63 components , all of which are complete .",
    "for the tem record , the single mutants correspond to substitutions at exactly 37 positions .",
    "exactly 21 nodes out of the 37 have degree zero .",
    "the position graph has 37 nodes and 25 edges .",
    "consider the block model ( for at least two blocks ) .",
    "the following observations are potentially problematic for a block model .    1 .",
    "there is an abundance of nodes of degree zero ( 21 our of 37 ) , 2 .",
    "the total number of edges is ( only ) 25 and there are 37 nodes .",
    "the maximal degree for a nodes is 8 , 4 .",
    "@xmath62 has several triangles , in particular a triangle consisting of the three nodes of highest degree out of all nodes of @xmath62 .    under the perfect record assumptions , the block model implies that the degree of each node is at least one ( provided that the nodes are distributed over at least two blocks ) .",
    "for the case of two blocks , the number of edges is between 36 and @xmath64 , where the minimum corresponds to the distribution 1 and 36 nodes per block , and the maximum corresponds to the distribution of 18 and 19 nodes per block . in the first case , one node should have degree 36 .",
    "however , the maximal degree of nodes in the position graph ( fig .",
    "it is clear that the position graph has too few edges for similar block lengths , and too low maximal degree for unequal block length .    for more than two blocks ,",
    "even more edges are expected leading to similar problems .",
    "clearly the block model is not compatible with the data under the perfect record conditions .",
    "consider the case of exactly two blocks in a more realistic situation .",
    "then the position graphs should have essentially no triangles by remark [ og ] .",
    "this is because at least two of the nodes in a triangle are on the same block .",
    "( moreover , for two blocks a reasonable guess would be that the three nodes of highest degree ( 39 , 69 , 164 ) are on the same block [ the shorter one ] .",
    "if so , it is unexpected with a triangle consisting of the three nodes . )",
    "it remains to consider the single record condition and consider more than two blocks . in that case , let us analyze the fact that there are relatively few edges .",
    "21 out of 37 nodes have degree zero , and in fact one can find a set of 31 nodes ( including the 21 nodes ) in the position graph , such that _ no pairs in the set are neighbors_. that implies that among 31 nodes one can not find a single pair of nodes on different blocks , such that both of them have high fitness in the same environment .",
    "this is of course possible , especially taken into account that the record may be incomplete .",
    "however , from knowledge of the context , it does not seem plausible .",
    "the number of completely different environments is limited .    from the tem record and some knowledge of the context ,",
    "the block model is probably not a good fit for the tem family .",
    "we will compare the results from the tem record with a laboratory study .",
    "the advantage with the laboratory study is that one can use drug specific information , which takes care of the difficulties resulting from multiple environments .    the study @xcite considered the antibiotics ampicillin ( amp ) , ceftazidime ( caz ) cefpodoxime ( cpd ) , cefprozil ( crp ) , cefotetan ( ctt ) , cefotaxime ( ctx ) , cefepime ( fep ) and pipercillin / tazobactam penicillin / inhibitor ( tzp ) .",
    "fitness ranks were detremined for the 4 single mutants l21f , r164s , t265 m , e240k . as well as the 6 double mutants than can be obtained from them , for each of the 8 antibiotics .    in particular ,",
    "for the drug ceftazidime ( caz ) , 4 single mutants were more fit than the wild - type , so that one can obtain 6 double mutants from the single mutants .",
    "out of the 6 double mutants for ceftazidime , 5 double mutants were more fit than at least one of the single mutants , and one double mutant ( the combination of r164s and e240k ) was more fit than both corresponding single mutants .",
    "for the 9 antibiotics , we list the number of single mutants with higher fitness than the wild - typ . and below the @xmath34-value .",
    "@xmath65 the mean values is 0.57 .",
    "obviously the data deviates considerably from additive fitness as well as uncorrelated fitness .    for a comparison ,",
    "combinations of 5 beneficial mutations from an experimental _ escherichia coli _ population were considered in @xcite .",
    "negative epistasis dominated , but sign epistasis was rare .",
    "consider the 10 double mutants combining pairs of the 5 beneficial mutations .",
    "every double mutant had higher fitness than at least one of its corresponding single mutant , so that @xmath66 .",
    "as for the block model , with very few exceptions , the double mutants in @xmath60 should be more fit than _ both _ single mutants , or less fit than _ both _ corresponding single mutants , by remark [ og ] . for the 9 drugs",
    ", one can form in total 19 double mutants .",
    "5 of them are more fit than both corresponding single mutants , 6 of them are more fit than _ exactly one _ corresponding single mutants , and 8 of them are less fit than _ both _ corresponding single mutants .",
    "this observation indicates that the block model does not apply .",
    "notice also that the most plausible block distribution of nodes differ from drug to drug ( for some drugs node 21 and 265 should be on the same block , and for other drugs not ) .",
    "neither additive fitness , uncorrelated fitness , nor the block model is compatible with data from the laboratory study @xcite .",
    "we have compared expectations from additive , uncorrelated , and block models of fitness landscapes with empirical data .",
    "we argue that the tem family of @xmath0-lactamases is not compatible with the three models . under the simplified assumptions of a complete record and a single environment",
    ", we found that the tem data was not compatible with anyone of the three models . under more realistic assumptions for the tem family ,",
    "the data was not compatible with uncorrelated fitness .",
    "similarly , using the record and some knowledge of the biological context , it seems plausible that neither the additive nor the block model is a good fit .",
    "our conclusions for the three models were confirmed by a laboratory study of tem alleles . we did not compared the tem family and the nk model .",
    "however , the symmetry aspect ( see remark [ sym ] ) could be problematic .",
    "the literature on additive , uncorrelated block and nk models literature is extensive .",
    "some approaches in the field have been motivated by theoretical considerations , such as relating epistasis to the number of peaks of a fitness landscape .",
    "the purpose of our study was not to debate the value of the classical models .",
    "we appreciate that toy models can be used for generating fruitful hypotheses , which can be tested empirically . as for additive and uncorrelated fitness ,",
    "the extremes will always be of interest as a theoretical starting point .",
    "however , the classical models have been used for interpretations of empirical data as well . a standard assumption for several topics in evolutionary biology and breeding is additive ( or multiplicative ) fitness , in particular for studies of fitness inheritance and sexual selection ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "statistical methods which are suitable for uncorrelated fitness landscapes have been used in empirical studies ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) , and the nk model is frequently used in empirical contexts . from this perspective , it is reasonable to discuss to what extent the classical models are realistic .",
    "we have suggested elementary tools , including the qualitative measure of additivity and the position graph , for comparing models and data .",
    "our approach demonstrates that one can determine properties of fitness landscapes from a record of mutations .",
    "the ideal setting is a single environment .",
    "it would be of interest to compare the qualitative measure of additivity with observed behavior for microbes , such as recombination strategies .",
    "the position graph can be used as a test of modularity .",
    "we consider it an advantage that our approach does not depend on any structural assumptions of the underlying fitness landscapes .",
    "any case of adaptation where one has a well - defined wild - type and some direct or indirect method for determining fitness ranks of genotypes works .",
    "qualitative information has its limitations .",
    "the ideal information for determining properties of fitness landscapes is of course direct fitness measurements . for obvious reasons",
    "such information is sometimes difficult , if even possible , to derive .",
    "moreover , laboratory results do not always agree with clinical findings .",
