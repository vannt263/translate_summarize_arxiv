    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy experiment has published its first year data and has already provided remarkable results . it has confirmed that the first peak in the power - spectrum occurs at @xmath19 and has provided an excellent further detection of the second peak @xcite . in the first instance , these new results seem to provide further support for the standard @xmath20cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "but the main new result from wmap is the detection of polarisation at large scales which can only have come from an epoch of reionisation at @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this results in a significant , ( @xmath030 per cent ) , reduction of the acoustic peak heights due to thomson scattering and shows that the cmb anisotropies are seriously affected by low redshift galaxy formation physics .",
    "furthermore , wmap also finds a low quadrupole in the temperature power - spectrum @xcite and this is also unexpected if the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect caused by relatively recent domination of the cosmological constant is present .",
    "therefore , although wmap data supports the standard model , there are significant problems and already strong evidence that the temperature spectrum is affected by cosmic foregrounds such as the re - ionised intergalactic medium at @xmath21 .    here",
    "we investigate the possibility that other low redshift processes have filtered the wmap temperature spectrum . in particular , we shall search for sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) , inverse compton - scattering of microwave background photons by hot gas in clusters .",
    "various authors have made model dependent predictions for contamination of the cmb data from the sz effect and usually concluded that the contaminating effects were small @xcite .",
    "the new wmap data gives a first real opportunity to make empirical checks of the level of contamination by direct cross - correlation of the high resolution 94ghz w band with galaxy cluster data .",
    "the wmap team themselves have presented evidence for both sz and radio source contamination in the wmap data .",
    "@xcite list 208 point sources detected at more than @xmath22 in the wmap data and identified them as radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "they also find significant wmap w band sz detections of the brightest x - ray clusters such as coma and also found a @xmath23 detection of the sz effect in the xbacs sample of 242 x - ray bright abell clusters @xcite .",
    "however , they only looked for sz decrements on the scale of the wmap beam and did not explore any larger scales .    while this paper was in preparation",
    ", several other related papers have appeared . @xcite and @xcite have claimed evidence for the isw effect in the wmap data from cross - correlation with the nvss catalogue . @xcite",
    "have cross - correlated x - ray data and the wmap data .",
    "similarly @xcite have cross - correlated apm galaxies and wmap data ; they find a marginal detection of the isw effect at 5 - 10 deg scales and suggest that the lack of a detection at smaller scales may be due to cancellation with an sz effect .",
    "@xcite have obtained upper limits on diffuse sz emission from superclusters from failing to find any cross - correlation with the abell - corwin - olowin ( aco ) and other cluster catalogues but they did find significant correlations from individual clusters . @xcite have claimed to detect significant blazar contamination in wmap and boomerang data .",
    "@xcite have claimed the detection of sz , isw and point sources in a power spectrum analysis of wmap data and the 2mass galaxy catalogue .",
    "the wmap data has been published by @xcite in healpix format . here",
    "we shall principally use the wmap w band data at 94@xmath3ghz because of its relatively high resolution compared to the other bands .",
    "the fwhm of the 94@xmath3ghz w beam is @xmath24 compared to @xmath25 at v ( 61@xmath3ghz ) , @xmath26 at q ( 41@xmath3ghz ) , @xmath27 at ka ( 33@xmath3ghz ) and @xmath28 at k ( 23@xmath3ghz ) .",
    "although , none of the beams is exactly gaussian ( see fig . 2 of @xcite )",
    "we have found that gaussians of the above fwhm are good approximate fits to cross - correlation results between faint radio point sources and wmap data .",
    "we shall also use the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map which has 1 deg resolution @xcite .",
    "also the w band has most sensitivity to the sz effect via its high resolution , although perhaps has higher noise than the v band .",
    "the healpix wmap data we shall use has equal area pixels of 49@xmath3arcmin@xmath29 . where necessary",
    ", we shall use the kp0 wmap mask of @xcite which mainly masks galactic contamination but usually its effect is small because we shall generally be working at galactic latitudes , @xmath3040 deg .",
    "the maps all use thermodynamic temperature and the cosmological dipole has already been subtracted from the data by the wmap team",
    ".      we shall be using three galaxy cluster catalogues .",
    "the first is the aco catalogue of @xcite which lists clusters with 30 or more members in a 1.5@xmath31mpc radius within @xmath32mag of the 3rd brightest cluster member .",
    "it assigns richness class ( @xmath33 ) with coma classed as @xmath34 .",
    "the northern catalogue with @xmath35 deg lists 2489 clusters with @xmath36 the southern catalogue with @xmath37 deg lists 1346 such clusters .",
    "the sky density in the north is therefore 0.52@xmath3deg@xmath38 and in the south it is 0.28@xmath3deg@xmath38 .",
    "the sky density of @xmath39 clusters is 0.063@xmath3deg@xmath38 with an average redshift of @xmath40 .",
    "we shall also use galaxy group and cluster catalogues derived from the apm galaxy survey of @xcite which covers the whole area with @xmath41deg and @xmath42deg .",
    "these were identified using the same ` friends - of - friends ' algorithm as @xcite and references therein .",
    "circles around each apm galaxy with @xmath43 are ` grown ' until the overdensity , @xmath44 , falls to @xmath45 and those galaxies whose circles overlap are called groups .",
    "minimum memberships , @xmath46 , of @xmath47 and @xmath48 were used which define minimum group effective ` radii ' of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , since the apm galaxy surface density is @xmath51deg@xmath38 at @xmath43 .",
    "we assume an average redshift of @xmath52 for both apm samples .",
    "the sky density of groups and clusters is 3.5@xmath3deg@xmath38 at @xmath53 and 0.35@xmath3deg@xmath38 at @xmath48 .",
    "even at @xmath48 there are differences between the aco and apm catalogues ; an @xmath54 abell cluster at @xmath40 may contain only a galaxy sky density of 260@xmath3deg@xmath38 within its @xmath55 abell radius compared to a minimum sky density of 5250@xmath3deg@xmath38 for galaxies within the apm groups .",
    "therefore the @xmath56 aco ` clusters ' may accommodate much lower density galaxy associations than even the @xmath47 apm groups which are guaranteed to sample higher density regions , albeit over smaller areas .",
    "the third cluster catalogue is derived from the final data release of the 2mass extended source catalogue ( xsc ) @xcite to a limit of @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58-selected galaxy samples are dominated by early - type galaxies because of their red colours and early - type galaxies are the most common galaxy - type found in rich galaxy clusters .",
    "therefore the 2mass survey provides an excellent tracer of the high density parts of the universe out to @xmath59 and so provides a further test for the existence of the sz effect . using the above 2-d friends - of - friends algorithm , we have detected 500 groups and clusters with @xmath60 members at the density contrast @xmath45 in the @xmath61deg area .",
    "the 2mass groups have average redshift , @xmath62 .",
    "we search for correlated signals between the 5 ( @xmath16 ilc ) wmap bands and the above datasets using a simple cross - correlation technique .",
    "the wmap data are presented in the form of temperature differences with respect to the global mean and we form the correlation function by calculating the average @xmath63 in annuli around each cluster as a function of angular distance , @xmath64 , between the cluster and pixel centres .    at large @xmath64 , where the average background may be expected to be sampled ,",
    "the average in particular areas of the sky may not return to zero , probably because of galactic contamination .",
    "we therefore always calculate the simple average of all temperature differences in the sub - area of sky used and plot this on the cross - correlation result as the effective zero level ( solid lines ) .",
    "the errors are calculated by repeated monte carlo random realisations of the cluster centres across the wmap area used .",
    "the realisations always have the same number of points as the parent sample and 100 realisations were done in each case .",
    "the effect of clustering of clusters is included in the realisations ; the clustering amplitude is matched to that of the cluster sample under consideration . in the cross - correlation functions ,",
    "there is significant correlation between the results at different angles , @xmath64 , so we have also calculated monte - carlo errors in the integrated bins used to quote overall significances .",
    "the monte carlo realisations also quite accurately return results that are close to the overall average , indicating that our cross - correlation technique is free of any systematics .",
    "we note that our error analysis will miss variance from cmb modes of order the cluster catalogue size .",
    "since this size is generally @xmath65deg , it is not expected that error estimates on angular scales @xmath66deg will be seriously affected , although on larger scales our quoted errors may increasingly be underestimates .",
    "= 8.4truecm    in fig .",
    "1a , b we first present the results from cross - correlating our apm groups and cluster centres with the wmap w band data .",
    "we consider the two apm cluster samples with @xmath67 and @xmath53 members .",
    "both samples show indications of anti - correlation with respect to the 94@xmath3ghz data .",
    "relative to the overall mean , the integrated significances for the @xmath67 sample range from @xmath68 at @xmath69 to @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "the significances for the @xmath53 sample range from @xmath72 at @xmath69 to @xmath73 at @xmath71 . in the case of the @xmath67 clusters , the size of the anti - correlation is @xmath74mk on wmap pixel scales .",
    "it is also interesting that the size of the signal only goes down slightly to @xmath75mk at small scales for the @xmath47 sample and here the anti - correlation appears to extend beyond the beam - size , only reducing to @xmath76 at @xmath77 .",
    "the anti - correlation signal seen at small @xmath64 ( @xmath78 ) is consistent with what is expected at this frequency for the temperature decrement caused by the sz effect @xcite .",
    "the surprise is that it can be seen out to @xmath01@xmath3deg scales and that it persists in groups with a sky density of 3.5@xmath3deg@xmath38 , a factor @xmath030@xmath79 higher than that of the abell clusters .",
    "we now turn to the aco catalogue to see if there is any confirmation of this tentative detection of extended anti - correlation around the apm groups and clusters .",
    "when the full aco catalogue at @xmath80deg including clusters of all richnesses , was used only an insignificant anti - correlation was found .",
    "the catalogue was then cut back to @xmath81 and the result changed dramatically and consistently in both hemispheres .",
    "based on the remaining 229 clusters with @xmath82deg and the remaining 377 clusters with @xmath42deg , significant anti - correlation is again seen out to scales of @xmath83deg or @xmath07.5@xmath31mpc ( see fig .",
    "the monte - carlo errors indicate that the effect is significant at the @xmath84 level for @xmath69 and at the @xmath85 level for @xmath86deg in the n@xmath16s sample .",
    "our interpretation is that the @xmath87 clusters may have too low densities to produce a strong sz effect .",
    "we conclude that there is a significant anti - correlation out to @xmath88deg scales between the aco @xmath89 cluster catalogue and the wmap w band data , confirming the tentative detection seen in the apm group and cluster catalogues , and that this is likely to be caused by the sz effect .",
    "= 8.4truecm    figs .",
    "2 ( a - f ) shows that the aco @xmath89 clusters also produce anti - correlations in all the other frequency bands , including the ilc . in terms of the predicted sz frequency dependence according to equations ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) of @xcite",
    "this is expected because relative to the w band the v , q , ka and k bands the sz decrement should increase by the factors 1.16 , 1.21 , 1.25 and 1.25 .",
    "the poorer resolution of the low frequency wmap bands makes the detection of the decrements more unexpected but it is explained by the apparent persistence of the signal out to scales well in extent of the w band beam .",
    "the frequency dependence of the sz signal appears statistically consistent with the sz prediction ( dashed lines ) in all except the k band where the combination of poor resolution and residual galactic contamination may be the cause of the poor fit .",
    "however , the errors are too large to discriminate between the sz and cmb spectral indices .",
    "it is this spectral similarity which makes it difficult to reject sz contamination in the cmb maps and which explains our sz detection in the ` clean ' ilc map .",
    "the apm clusters and groups also show anti - correlations in the v and q bands but less so in the other bands , probably because of the lower resolution .    to check",
    "if the cross - correlation results contain artefacts characteristic of residual galactic foreground contamination , we have cross - correlated the aco clusters with the wmap foreground maps of @xcite and find no indication of any strong systematics .",
    "we also note that we have obtained results for the sz decrements from the aco , apm and 2mass clusters from the ` foreground - cleaned ' map of @xcite that are entirely consistent with those found from the ilc map ; the detection of the same anti - correlation in both of these ` clean ' maps further argues against the possibility that the anti - correlation is due to foreground systematics .",
    "= 8.4truecm    as a further powerful check against systematics caused by foreground contamination , we have also applied the cross - correlation analysis after rotating the aco @xmath89 clusters around the galactic poles with respect to the wmap w and v band data .",
    "3 shows the w and v band cross - correlation signals ( relative to the mean @xmath63 ) integrated to the beam half - maximum ( @xmath90 for w , @xmath91 for v ) , @xmath92 and @xmath93 measured at intervals of @xmath94 deg of galactic longitude .",
    "the solid line shows the difference between the beam half - maximum and the @xmath93 angular scales ; this is to test for the persistence of the beam - size anti - correlation under the assumption that the @xmath93 result is entirely due to systematic effects .",
    "the anti - correlation at the beam half - maximum is clearly significant whether measured relative to the overall mean ( @xmath95 for w , @xmath96 for v ) or the @xmath93 results ( @xmath97 for w , @xmath95 for v ) .",
    "the anti - correlation at @xmath92 also remains significant whether measured relative to the overall mean ( @xmath98 for w , @xmath99 for v ) or relative to the @xmath93 results ( @xmath72 for w , @xmath68 for v ) .",
    "although the rotated results appear more correlated at @xmath92 than at @xmath90 , implying these latter significances be treated with caution , it remains the case that for the @xmath92 the zero rotation result shows the lowest @xmath63 .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath93 points where several of the rotated points show both lower and higher excursions around zero than the zero rotation result .",
    "clearly there may be systematics which are beginning to dominate any real sz signal at these very large scales .",
    "we conclude that the rotation experiments suggest that the observed temperature decrements around aco clusters are significant from the beam - size out to @xmath92 and these results are robust to the assumption that the cross - correlation is dominated by possible systematics on @xmath93 scales .",
    "1(d ) shows the cross - correlation of the 500 2mass groups and clusters limited at @xmath100 with the wmap w band .",
    "again the 2mass data shows similar trends to the apm and aco clusters with anti - correlation seen on scales of the beam and extending at marginal significance out to scales of @xmath101 deg .",
    "again the frequency dependence is consistent with an sz signal ( not shown ) . at the average 2mass group redshift , @xmath62",
    ", @xmath102 deg corresponds to @xmath103mpc and thus here there is further evidence for possible extension of the sz decrements to scales of order @xmath104mpc .",
    "we have found evidence for wmap temperature decrements extending out to scales of @xmath105 deg from galaxy groups and clusters , with hints that the decrements may extend to even larger scales .",
    "previous cross - correlation of the aco catalogue with the rosat all - sky survey has shown diffuse x - ray emission from @xmath88kev gas extending out to @xmath106 deg from @xmath107 , @xmath108 abell clusters , comparable to the scale of the anti - correlation seen in fig . 1c @xcite .",
    "thus , based on this indication that the anti - correlation may be caused by the sz effect originating from diffuse ` supercluster ' gas , we make a first order calculation of the overall compton parameter , @xmath109 . from @xcite",
    "we use the relation @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the cmb temperature , @xmath112 and @xmath113 is a spectral function which takes the value @xmath114 at 94@xmath3ghz .",
    "the simplest route is to go via the @xmath47 apm groups and clusters because these have the biggest space density and so are the most representative of average sightlines .",
    "these have a sky density of 3.5@xmath3deg@xmath38 with an average sz decrement that extends to @xmath115deg and so have a sky covering factor of approximately unity . for @xmath116deg in fig .",
    "1b , @xmath63 is reasonably flat so that effects due to the wmap beam may be small and in this range @xmath117k . using the above relation with @xmath118k , this converts into a value for @xmath2 .",
    "now @xcite refer to @xcite and @xcite as suggesting that 40 per cent of @xmath109 originates at @xmath15 in cdm models . on this assumption , we find @xmath119 .",
    "this compares to the 3@xmath120 upper limit on the total integrated @xmath109 parameter from the cobe - firas measurement of the spectral distortion of the cmb of @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "the 3@xmath120 upper limit from cross - correlating cobe dmr and firas is @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a 3@xmath120 upper limit of @xmath123 by cross - correlating cobe dmr with the aco cluster catalogue .",
    "thus our result is not inconsistent with these previous observational upper limits .",
    "we also note that our estimate of @xmath109 is 2 - 3@xmath79 higher than that predicted in the scdm model of @xcite and that it is similar to the value predicted in the @xmath20cdm model of @xcite .",
    "we next fit isothermal models to the sz decrements for the aco r@xmath1242 clusters .",
    "the models are taken from equns .",
    "15 , 16 of @xcite and convolved with gaussians to represent the beams .",
    "we assume the value of @xmath125 quoted for coma and a value of @xmath126 which is the coma value scaled approximately to the @xmath40 average redshift of the aco sample .",
    "we find that 0.083@xmath3mk is the best fit for @xmath127 compared to the 0.5@xmath3mk quoted for coma .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "1(b),(c ) .",
    "it can be seen that the data appears to show a more extended decrement than the model .",
    "the same model with @xmath128 gives an improved fit at larger scales for @xmath127 of 0.05@xmath3mk .",
    "the cluster correlation function @xcite suggests the number of excess clusters at @xmath129 from an average cluster is @xmath130 .",
    "based on the average decrement seen at @xmath131 , we estimate this cluster excess will contribute @xmath132k , at @xmath129 , compared to the observed @xmath133k .",
    "thus it does not seem possible for clustering of ` beam - sized ' clusters to explain the extent of the decrement ; an extended ( @xmath134 deg ) gas halo around individual clusters appears to be needed .",
    "we next calculate the gas mass associated with an aco @xmath39 cluster .",
    "using equation ( 16 ) of @xcite and assuming @xmath135kev , @xmath136mpc , the w band fit with @xmath137mk gives a value for the central electron density , @xmath138@xmath139 . integrating equn .",
    "( 14 ) of @xcite with @xmath125 to @xmath140mpc ( @xmath141 ) then gives a gas mass of @xmath142 , which is not unreasonable compared to the x - ray gas mass of @xmath143 detected within a similar radius in the coma cluster @xcite .    a model with @xmath125 , @xmath144 and @xmath145mk is shown to give a reasonable fit at small scales to the apm @xmath146 sample in fig .",
    "@xmath144 is the coma value of @xmath136mpc scaled to @xmath52 .",
    "again there is evidence that the profile is more extended than the model .",
    "we now proceed to calculate the average gas mass associated with an apm @xmath146 group / cluster . using equation ( 16 ) of @xcite and assuming @xmath136mpc , the w band fit with @xmath147mk gives a value for the central electron density , @xmath148@xmath149kev ) .",

    "assuming @xmath10 , @xmath9kev and @xmath8 gives @xmath11 , close to the wmap @xmath156 result @xcite",
    ". there may be evidence in fig .",
    "1(b ) for the sz decrements to extend to @xmath157 . in this case",
    ", the masses associated with apm groups rise by a further factor of @xmath106 implying @xmath158 , now a factor of @xmath159 higher than the standard value for @xmath160 .",
    "is there any possibility that sz decrements in the wmap 94@xmath3ghz data could contaminate the acoustic peaks measurement ?",
    "the question is interesting because the sz correlations appear to extend out to @xmath105 deg , the location of the first acoustic peak in the power spectrum .",
    "we have therefore run some simple models where circular areas representing clusters with sz decrements are distributed at random over simulated cmb fields , laid down from gaussian random fields drawn from cmbfast power spectra @xcite .",
    "if the sz clusters have the same 3.5@xmath3deg@xmath38 sky density as the apm @xmath47 groups and we assume that they extend only to @xmath161deg with a decrement @xmath162k then the sz power spectrum of clusters is two orders of magnitude below the first peak at wavenumber @xmath17 .",
    "however , if we assume that these groups and clusters extend unevolved in their gas content past the @xmath15 apm limit out to @xmath163 , then the group @xmath16 cluster sky density will rise to @xmath164deg@xmath38 .",
    "if we further assume values for the sz extent and decrement which are at the high end of the ranges so far suggested , i.e. @xmath86deg and @xmath165k , then an sz peak appears in the power spectrum which is of order @xmath030 per cent of the amplitude of the first acoustic peak at @xmath17 .",
    "the consequences for the lower amplitude acoustic peaks at higher multipoles could be even more serious ; we note that the temperature power spectrum from the cbi experiment already shows an excess at @xmath166 which may be due to a strong sz effect from individual clusters @xcite .",
    "the above models might run up against the @xmath122 upper limit of @xcite .",
    "_ however , it is clear that the question of how much sz effects contaminate the primordial power spectrum is re - opened by the spatial extent of the sz signal found in our results . _",
    "higher resolution cmb data and deeper group and cluster catalogues are needed to constrain further the sz contribution from @xmath167 clusters .",
    "we have found evidence for anti - correlation between wmap data and the positions on the sky of galaxy clusters derived from the aco , apm and 2mass surveys .",
    "we interpret the signal as caused by the sz effect , inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons by hot gas in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the signal may extend to @xmath88deg scales around aco clusters , implying they have extended gaseous haloes which may also constitute a diffuse gas component in superclusters .",
    "we estimate the mean compton @xmath109 parameter associated with @xmath15 apm groups and clusters as @xmath2 .",
    "this is not inconsistent with previous upper limits and with expectations from cdm models .",
    "we have also estimated the average @xmath39 aco cluster gas mass assuming @xmath135kev and found this to be in reasonable agreement with x - ray observations of individual aco clusters within the central radius , @xmath140mpc .",
    "the average mass of apm groups@xmath16clusters is found to be @xmath4mpc@xmath168kev@xmath169 which gives @xmath155kev@xmath170 . for @xmath9kev and @xmath10",
    "this value for @xmath11 is close to the value of @xmath12 in the standard model @xcite .",
    "but because the x - ray temperatures are likely to be lower than @xmath171kev and because the sz decrements show evidence for gas haloes which extend beyond @xmath172mpc then this value for @xmath14 could well prove to be a lower limit on the true value .",
    "we have briefly investigated how sz contamination might affect the location and shape of the acoustic peaks in the wmap temperature and find that although there is little effect from the temperature decrements found so far , if they persist out to @xmath173 with the amplitude and extent seen at @xmath15 , then even the first acoustic peak at the @xmath171deg scale could be significantly affected .",
    "further cross - correlation analysis of deeper catalogues of groups and clusters will be needed to judge the seriousness of this potential sz ` contamination ' .",

    "<S> we have cross - correlated the wmap data with several surveys of extragalactic sources and find evidence for temperature decrements associated with galaxy clusters and groups detected in the apm galaxy survey survey and the aco catalogue . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this as evidence for the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect from the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , the signal may extend to @xmath01 deg ( @xmath1mpc ) around both groups and clusters and we suggest that this may be due to hot ` supercluster ' gas . </S>",
    "<S> we have further cross - correlated the wmap data with clusters identified in the 2mass galaxy catalogue and also find evidence for temperature decrements there . from the apm group data we estimate the mean compton parameter as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we have further estimated the gas mass associated with the galaxy group and cluster haloes . </S>",
    "<S> assuming temperatures of 5@xmath3kev for aco clusters and 1@xmath3kev for apm groups and clusters , </S>",
    "<S> we derive average gas masses of @xmath4mpc@xmath5 for both , the assumed gas temperature and sz central decrement differences approximately cancelling . using the space density of apm groups </S>",
    "<S> we then estimate @xmath6(1@xmath3kev@xmath7 . for an sz extent of @xmath8 , @xmath9kev and @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath11 is consistent with the standard value of @xmath12 but if the indications we have found for a more extended sz effect out to @xmath13 are confirmed , then higher values of @xmath14 will be implied . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the contribution to the wmap temperature power spectrum from the extended sz effect around the @xmath15 apm@xmath16aco groups and clusters is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than the @xmath17 first acoustic peak . </S>",
    "<S> but if a similar sz effect arises from more distant clusters then this contribution could increase by a factor @xmath18 and then could seriously affect the wmap cosmological fits .    </S>",
