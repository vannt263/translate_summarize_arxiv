    "in local molecular clouds , molecular hydrogen ( @xmath0 ) forms primarily on the surface of dust grains : two hydrogen atoms are adsorbed onto the surface of the grain and react to form @xmath0 , which subsequently escapes back into the interstellar medium .",
    "however , @xmath0 can also form in the gas - phase , primarily through the reactions @xmath2 although some also forms via the slower reactions @xmath3 in dense gas , three - body reactions can also be important @xcite , but these are ineffective at number densities @xmath4 .",
    "discussions of @xmath0 formation have tended to concentrate on the role played by dust , with little attention given to the gas - phase reactions . however , as i show in section  [ astro ] , in some circumstances these reactions can dominate the @xmath0 formation rate .    in this paper ,",
    "i briefly outline the chemistry of @xmath0 formation and show that it is easy to identify a critical dust - to - gas ratio @xmath1 , above which grain - catalyzed formation dominates .",
    "i illustrate the method by applying it to various situations of astrophysical interest , and show that it can be a useful tool for estimating the importance of gas - phase @xmath0 formation .",
    "most of the molecular hydrogen that forms in the gas - phase does so via the formation of an intermediate @xmath5 ion , as outlined in reactions  [ h2f1 ] and [ h2f2 ] above .",
    "the first of these reactions occurs much more slowly than the second , and so the equilibrium abundance of @xmath5 is small and is rapidly reached .",
    "thereafter , the @xmath0 formation rate is determined by two factors : the rate at which @xmath5 forms , and the fraction of @xmath5 ions that survive to form @xmath0 .",
    "the latter quantity is determined by competition between @xmath0 formation via reaction  [ h2f2 ] and @xmath5 destruction by mutual neutralization with @xmath6 ions @xmath7 and by photodetachment by the incident radiation field @xmath8 various other reactions also destroy @xmath5 , but these are either significantly slower than those above , or become important only at high temperatures , in which case any @xmath0 that does form will very quickly be collisionally dissociated . for more details ,",
    "the reader is referred to the recent reviews of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if we assume , for simplicity , that @xmath5 has already reached its equilibrium abundance , then we can write the @xmath0 formation rate as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number density of species @xmath11 , and where the rate coefficients @xmath12 for the various reactions are listed in table  [ chem ] .",
    "if @xmath0 formation via reaction  [ h2f2 ] occurs much faster than the destruction of @xmath5 by the other reactions , then this reduces to @xmath13 in other words , the @xmath0 formation rate is approximately the same as the @xmath5 formation rate .",
    "if , on the other hand , mutual neutralization dominates over @xmath0 formation or photodetachment as a means of removing @xmath5 , then equation  [ general ] becomes @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fractional ionization of hydrogen .",
    "as long as @xmath16 , this equation can be further simplified to @xmath17    comparing this equation with equation  [ low_x ] , we see that for a small fractional ionization @xmath18 , but that once the fractional ionization becomes large enough that mutual neutralization dominates , @xmath19 becomes independent of the ionization : although increases in @xmath20 still increase the @xmath5 formation rate , this is balanced by the increase in the mutual neutralization rate and consequent decrease in the fraction of @xmath5 ions surviving to form @xmath0 .",
    "this change in behaviour occurs for fractional ionizations near a critical value @xmath21 , defined by @xmath22 the precise value of @xmath21 is somewhat uncertain , due to the significant uncertainty that remains in the determination of the mutual neutralization rate . in this paper ,",
    "i have chosen to adopt the rate listed in @xcite , which is derived from the data of @xcite .",
    "this is a conservative choice , in that it gives the lowest value of @xmath21 ; other possibilities include the rates of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , with the last - named being preferred by the most recent compilation @xcite .",
    "for the temperature range of interest , the @xcite rate gives us a value @xmath23 , with only a slight dependence on temperature .",
    "the alternative rates typically give values of @xmath21 that are factors of a few larger .",
    "when the destruction rate of @xmath5 ions is dominated by photodetachment , we obtain another limiting case of equation  [ general ] @xmath24 this can be written as the @xmath5 formation rate divided by a suppression factor @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27    determination of the photodetachment rate , and hence @xmath25 , requires knowledge of the incident radiation field .",
    "provided that the opacity of the gas is low , we can write the photodetachment rate as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean specific intensity , @xmath30 is the photodetachment cross - section @xcite @xmath31 and where @xmath32 is the energy threshold for @xmath5 photodetachment .",
    "evaluating equation  [ hmpd ] for the local interstellar radiation field , as estimated by @xcite , gives @xmath33 and so , locally , @xmath34    if the opacity of the gas is high , then this will overestimate the effects of radiation .",
    "however , at frequencies near the @xmath5 photodetachment threshold , the continuum opacity of interstellar gas is low and absorption is dominated by dust .",
    "consequently , a high opacity implies a high dust content , in which case grain - catalyzed formation will dominate .",
    "these limiting cases provide useful insight into the physics of gas - phase @xmath0 formation , but in general we must use the full form of equation  [ general ] , which we can rewrite as @xmath35    if we now turn to @xmath0 formation via the @xmath36 ion , we find that the basic chemistry is remarkably similar .",
    "@xmath36 is created by the radiative association of @xmath37 and @xmath6 ( reaction  [ h2f3 ] ) , and destroyed by @xmath0 formation ( reaction  [ h2f4 ] ) , dissociative recombination @xmath38 and photodissociation @xmath39    as with @xmath5 , the formation of the molecular ion is the limiting step , with subsequent reactions occurring orders of magnitude faster .",
    "if we again assume that the @xmath36 abundance has reached equilibrium , then we can write the @xmath0 formation rate as @xmath40 which has the same form as equation  [ general ] . indeed",
    ", we can rewrite it as @xmath41 only now @xmath42 and @xmath43 where the photodissociation rate , @xmath44 , is calculated in a similar fashion to the photodetachment rate above . evaluating these , we find that @xmath21 for @xmath36 is typically an order of magnitude larger than for @xmath5 , and that in the local ism @xmath45 where i have again used the @xcite radiation field , together with the @xmath36 photodissociation cross - section from @xcite .",
    "comparing these values with those for @xmath5 , we see that @xmath36 is significantly more robust",
    ". however , it forms at a much slower rate ( between two and three orders of magnitude , depending on temperature ) and so in most cases @xmath5 dominates .",
    "nevertheless , there are exceptions , as we will see in section  [ astro ] .    finally ,",
    "a few other possible mechanisms have been suggested for gas - phase @xmath0 formation .",
    "@xcite propose that @xmath0 can form as a result of direct radiative association @xmath46 provided that one of the hydrogen atoms is in an excited electronic state .",
    "@xcite show that a more efficient mechanism is formation of @xmath36 by associative ionization @xmath47 with the @xmath36 thereafter forming @xmath0 by reaction  [ h2f4 ] above .",
    "this mechanism again requires one of the hydrogen atoms to be in an excited atomic state .",
    "however , this requirement means that in general these reactions are not important , as the necessary population of excited atomic hydrogen is only found in a few unusual circumstances , such as in the universe immediately after recombination .      despite its importance in local interstellar chemistry ,",
    "the rate of @xmath0 formation on dust grains is still uncertain . in local molecular clouds , observations suggest a formation rate @xcite @xmath48 observations of @xmath0 in the lmc and smc with the fuse satellite @xcite suggest a value that is an order of magnitude smaller , but this is consistent with the underlying rate per unit dust mass being the same , since the mean dust - to - gas ratio within these galaxies is significantly smaller than in the milky way @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , direct measurements of this kind can only give us information about @xmath0 formation in physical conditions that are easily accessible to observations , and provide little basis on which to predict the @xmath0 formation rate in different regimes .",
    "for this , we must turn to theory .    a large body of theoretical work exists on the subject of @xmath0 formation on grains ( see , for example , the review of * ? ? ? * and the many references therein ) , stretching back almost forty years to the pioneering work of @xcite . in a highly influential paper",
    ", @xcite parameterized the @xmath0 formation rate as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number density of dust grains , @xmath51 is their mean geometric cross - section , @xmath52 is the mean velocity of the hydrogen atoms striking the grains , @xmath53 is the sticking coefficient ( the probability that a hydrogen atom striking the grain will stick to the surface ) and @xmath54 is the fraction of adsorbed hydrogen atoms that actually form @xmath0 , rather than simply escaping back into the gas phase .",
    "they argued that for gas and grain temperatures typical of molecular clouds , both @xmath53 and @xmath54 should be of order unity .",
    "@xcite later used this prescription to derive an @xmath0 formation rate for the local ism that continues to be widely cited : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the gas and grain temperatures in units of @xmath59 .",
    "they argued that @xmath54 should be approximately constant and of order unity for grain temperatures below some critical value @xmath60 , but that for @xmath61 , it should fall off exponentially , with most of the hydrogen atoms evaporating from the grain surface before they have time to form @xmath0 . the value of @xmath60 has proved hard to determine precisely , but is of the order of @xmath59 .",
    "although this rate has been widely adopted in the literature , recent experiments have cast doubt on its validity at high temperatures , and suggest that the @xmath0 formation rate may be smaller than previously assumed ( pirronello _ et  al .",
    "_ 1997a , b , 1999 ; katz _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; biham _ et  al .",
    "however , since this conclusion is not entirely clear @xcite and their work is still ongoing , i have tentatively adopted the @xcite rate below , with the proviso that the values of @xmath1 that i derive may prove to be lower limits if the results of pirronello",
    "_ et  al . _",
    "are borne out by future work .",
    "we can combine equations  [ final_hm ] and [ final_h2p ] to write the total gas - phase @xmath0 formation rate as @xmath62 while the grain - catalyzed rate can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the total particle number density , @xmath65 is the dust - to - gas ratio and @xmath66 is its value in the local ism .    combining these equations",
    ", we can easily solve for the dust - to - gas ratio at which @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which i denote as @xmath1 : @xmath69 in the common case that @xmath70 , this equation reduces to @xmath71 where @xmath21 and @xmath25 are given by equations  [ xcr ] and [ frad ] respectively .",
    "a similar equation can be written in the much less common case that @xmath72 .    in order to help illustrate the behaviour of these equations , i plot in figures  [ fig1 ] to [ fig4 ] the value of @xmath1 as a function of temperature for gas illuminated by the @xcite radiation field in four different scenarios : low ionization , low density gas ( @xmath73 ;",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] ) , low ionization , high density gas ( @xmath74 ; figure  [ fig2 ] ) , high ionization , low density gas ( @xmath75 ; figure  [ fig3 ] ) and high ionization , high density gas ( @xmath76 ; figure  [ fig4 ] ) . in each case",
    ", i adopt a fixed grain temperature @xmath77 , although small changes in @xmath78 have little effect on the results provided that it remains less than @xmath60 .",
    "a striking feature of these plots is the strong temperature dependence of @xmath1 . at low temperatures ,",
    "grain - catalyzed @xmath0 formation is relatively efficient and very little dust is needed before grain catalysis dominates .",
    "above a few hundred k , however , the efficiency of grain catalysis decreases significantly , while the efficiency of gas - phase @xmath0 formation continues to grow . as a result ,",
    "the required dust abundance rises sharply with increasing temperature .",
    "from the behaviour outlined in figures  [ fig1][fig4 ] , it is clear that gas - phase @xmath0 formation is at its most effective in warm , dense gas with a high fractional ionization .",
    "however , most of the molecular gas that we observe in our galaxy is in the form of molecular clouds with low temperatures ( @xmath79 ) and very low fractional ionizations ( @xmath80 ) and in these conditions grain catalyzed formation dominates by many orders of magnitude .",
    "a more promising place to look for gas - phase @xmath0 formation is in the so - called warm neutral medium ( wnm ) . in models of the multiphase ism that assume thermal pressure equilibrium between phases",
    "@xcite , this is predicted to have a temperature of approximately @xmath81 , high enough to collisionally dissociate @xmath0 . however , recent observations @xcite and simulations that include the effects of turbulence @xcite suggest that much of this gas is actually at much lower temperatures ; for instance , @xcite quote a temperature range of @xmath82 .",
    "taking representative values for the temperature and ionization of the wnm to be @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite , i find that @xmath85 in other words , gas - phase formation would dominate if we could ignore the effects of the radiation field . in practice , this is not possible ; at the densities characteristic of the wnm ( @xmath86 ) , we have @xmath87 and equation  [ wnm ] becomes @xmath88    these two examples demonstrate that gas - phase @xmath0 formation is unimportant in the bulk of the gas in the milky way : either the temperature and ionization are too low , as in molecular clouds , or the gas is too diffuse and @xmath0 formation is suppressed by the photodissociation of @xmath5 and @xmath36 .    however , there are a few counterexamples . for instance",
    ", gas - phase @xmath0 formation has long been known to play an important role in the chemistry of nova ejecta @xcite and protostellar outflows @xcite , where the gas initially has little or no dust ( although more generally forms later ) and where the high gas densities help mitigate the effects of photodissociation .",
    "gas - phase formation is also predicted to dominate the molecular chemistry of freely - expanding supernova remnants such as sn1987a @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite suggest that gas - phase formation may dominate in x - ray dissociation regions ( dense clouds illuminated by hard x - rays ) ; modelling by @xcite would appear to confirm this .",
    "these are somewhat unusual conditions , however , and in general dust abundances significantly below the typical galactic value are required before gas - phase @xmath0 formation becomes competitive with grain - catalyzed formation .",
    "one place in which we might expect to find these low dust abundances is in the metal - poor gas within dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite examine a well - studied example , the metal - poor dwarf izw18 , and show that provided that its neutral ism is clumpy ( with clumps densities @xmath89 ) and moderately ionized ( @xmath90 ) , then gas - phase formation will dominate .",
    "they also show that the formation of @xmath0 in this manner would not conflict with the upper limit on the @xmath0 column density of izw18 obtained by fuse @xcite , due to the small filling factor of the clumps .",
    "another place we might look for significant gas - phase @xmath0 formation is in damped lyman-@xmath91 ( dla ) systems , many of which have low dust abundances ( see , eg * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting example is the absorber at @xmath92 in the spectrum of q0347 - 3819 recently studied by @xcite .",
    "this system has a temperature @xmath93 ( as inferred from the doppler broadening of its many associated @xmath0 and metal absorption lines ) , and a fractional ionization @xmath94 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath5 photodetachment is negligible , we find that for this system @xmath95 comparing this with a measured dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath96 , we see that gas - phase @xmath0 formation contributes no more than about 1% of the total @xmath0 in this system . including the effects of radiation merely strengthens this conclusion .",
    "there is no reason to suspect that this situation is particularly unusual ; all damped lyman-@xmath91 systems _ by definition _ have large column densities , and consequently will have small fractional ionizations .",
    "we would therefore expect grain - catalysis to dominate in these systems .",
    "finally , gas - phase @xmath0 formation has long been known to play an important role in the early stages of galaxy formation . in primordial gas",
    ", this is obvious : there is no dust , so any @xmath0 that forms _ must _ form in the gas phase .",
    "a more interesting problem is determining the value of @xmath1 for these systems ; in other words , at what point does grain - catalyzed formation overtake gas - phase formation ?    for the purposes of this discussion ,",
    "i adopt the example of an @xmath0-cooled protogalaxy with temperature @xmath97 and fractional ionization @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "these values are appropriate for the first generation of star - forming protogalaxies , and while they may be underestimates for later generations , my analysis can easily be rescaled for higher values .",
    "for this example protogalaxy , i find that @xmath99 thus , if the radiation field is unimportant , @xmath100 , comparable to the values seen in some metal - poor dwarf galaxies at the present - day @xcite .",
    "how strong is the radiation field within a protogalaxy ?",
    "there are potentially three main contributors to this field : the protogalaxy s own stellar population , emission from neighbouring galaxies and radiation from the cosmological background produced by distant sources .",
    "it is simplest to consider these separately .",
    "much of the optical and near - infrared radiation responsible for destroying @xmath5 and @xmath36 is produced by long - lived stars , and so the contribution of the protogalaxy s stellar population depends as much on its star formation history as on its current star formation rate .",
    "this makes it very difficult to parameterize its effects in the general case ; it is much easier to examine a simple example that will hopefully be broadly representative .    for the purposes of this example ,",
    "i assume :    1 .   that the protogalaxy underwent an instantaneous ( or near - instantaneous ) starburst @xmath101 ago , following which it has formed no more stars",
    "2 .   that the stars which did form are located in the centre of the protogalaxy , within a small enough region that i can approximate their emission as coming from a point source .",
    "3 .   that the luminosity and spectral energy distribution of this stellar cluster are well described by the @xmath102 model of @xcite .",
    "that the protogalaxy itself is well - described by a truncated isothermal sphere density profile @xcite .",
    "all of these assumptions are debatable , but they do provide us a basis on which to estimate the effects of the stellar radiation field . moreover , these assumptions are somewhat conservative , and tend to minimize the effectiveness of the stellar radiation .",
    "for instance , if we reduce the time since the starburst from @xmath101 to @xmath103 , then the photodetachment rate increases by a factor of fifty .",
    "similarly , if we assume continuous star - formation rather than an instantaneous starburst , then we obtain a similar ( or slightly larger ) photodetachment rate once the total mass of stars formed has reached a comparable level .",
    "we could also criticize the adoption of the @xcite model , on the basis that it assumes a standard salpeter imf , while there is considerable evidence that the the primordial imf is biased towards high masses @xcite .",
    "however , this again means that we will underestimate the photodetachment rate ( although we will significantly overestimate the lifetime of the stellar population ) .    returning to my example , the first two assumptions allow me to write the @xmath5 photodetachment rate at a distance @xmath104 from the stars as @xmath105 where @xmath106 , the stellar luminosity per unit frequency , is given by the @xcite model . using this value ,",
    "i obtain @xmath107 where @xmath108 and where @xmath109 is the mass of stars formed in the starburst .",
    "similarly , we can write the @xmath36 photodissociation rate as @xmath110 and from these rates calculate @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xmath113 by comparing these values and equation  [ my_pg ] , we can see that formation via @xmath36 contributes at most about 10% of the @xmath0 produced in the gas phase , with the rest coming from @xmath5 .    to evaluate these numbers , i use the fact that for a truncated isothermal sphere , @xmath114 in regions outside of the core .",
    "the final unknown , @xmath109 , can be written as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the star formation efficiency of the protogalaxy , @xmath117 is its redshift of formation and @xmath118 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath119 .    for a protogalaxy that formed in a standard @xmath120cdm cosmology ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) at a redshift @xmath124 , and that formed stars with an efficiency @xmath125 , we find that @xmath126 thus , in this particular example , radiation from the existing stellar population reduces @xmath1 by almost two orders of magnitude .    in view of the uncertainties involved in producing this estimate , it would be unwise to over - generalize . however , since my assumptions verge on the conservative side , it seems likely that in realistic protogalactic models we would see similar effects , and that gas - phase @xmath0 formation will rapidly be overtaken by grain - catalyzed formation .",
    "what about protogalaxies that have yet to form stars ?",
    "in this case , there is no significant local contribution to the radiation field , which instead is produced by neighbouring sources and/or the cosmological background .    for neighbouring sources",
    ", we can reuse the above formalism , as long as we set @xmath104 to the distance to the extragalactic source .",
    "however , this is typically an order of magnitude or more greater than the size of a protogalaxy , implying that the effect of the radiation will be _ at least _ two orders of magnitude smaller than the effects discussed above .",
    "consequently , radiation from protogalaxies of the size discussed here will have little or no effect on gas - phase @xmath0 formation within their neighbours , unless their emitted flux is substantially larger than has been assumed here .",
    "for the background , we again face the problem that any conclusions that we can draw are strictly limited by our poor knowledge of the star formation history , this time on a cosmological rather than protogalactic scale .",
    "the best that we can do is to determine how strong the background needs to be before it has a significant effect .",
    "modeling the background below the lyman limit as a power - law , @xmath127 where @xmath128 and where @xmath129 , i find that for @xmath130 , @xmath131 and hence @xmath132    the significance of the background varies with @xmath133 and hence with position within the protogalaxy .",
    "for my example protogalaxy , formed at a redshift @xmath134 , gas near the truncation radius has a density @xmath135 and thus is affected for @xmath136 ; on the other hand , gas in the central core has @xmath137 and is only affected for @xmath138 .",
    "the simplicity of the basic chemistry involved in gas - phase @xmath0 formation means that it is easy to construct a fairly accurate expression for the formation rate in terms of only a few parameters : the temperature , density and fractional ionization of the gas , plus the strength of the radiation field near the @xmath5 and @xmath36 photodissociation thresholds .",
    "expressions for the rate of @xmath0 formation via the @xmath5 and @xmath36 ions are given by equations  [ final_hm ] & [ final_h2p ] respectively , and the total formation rate is simply the sum of these two values .",
    "using these expressions , together with an analytical expression for the grain - catalyzed @xmath0 formation rate , one can solve for @xmath1 , the dust - to - gas ratio required for grain - catalyzed @xmath0 formation to overtake gas - phase formation .",
    "the results demonstrate that , in principle , gas - phase @xmath0 formation could be comparable to grain - catalyzed formation in galactic gas , particularly at high temperatures where the latter is inefficient . in practice , however , it is usually significantly slower , either because of a shortage of free electrons and protons ( which reduces the formation rate of the intermediate ions ) or because the incident radiation field destroys the ions before they have a chance to form @xmath0 .",
    "finally , in order to demonstrate the simplicity and potential utility of this approach , i have applied it to a number of astrophysical examples .",
    "not surprisingly , i find that in most cases @xmath1 is significantly less than the mean galactic value , often by several orders of magnitude . nevertheless , there are counterexamples , such as x - ray photodissociation regions @xcite , nova ejecta @xcite , or the high - redshift protogalaxies analyzed in detail here .",
    "a common thread linking many of these exceptions seems to be the fact that they have dust - to - gas ratios ( but not necessarily metallicities ) significantly lower than the mean galactic value .",
    "i would like to acknowledge useful comments on an earlier draft of this paper from mordecai mac - low and michael d. smith .",
