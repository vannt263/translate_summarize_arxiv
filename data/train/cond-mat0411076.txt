    "in recent years , a variety of transport experiments have been reported in molecular size systems , such as quantum dots and nanotubes , as a contribution to the current boost towards of the progress in nanoscale technology . from the theoretical side ,",
    "circuits of several kinds have been modeled@xcite , and in applied electronics the single - electron - transistors@xcite are among the most important devices .",
    "these are realized by connecting a nanoscopic conducting island to metallic leads and to a gate voltage .",
    "the energy gaps existing between states with different number of particles allow to fix the number of electrons in the island very sharply ; as a consequence single electrons can tunnel to or from the conductor .",
    "even more appealing situations arise when the above scenario is complicated by electron - electron interactions , as in the case of a superconducting - single electron transistor ( s - set ) .",
    "a s - set is a mesoscopic device obtained by linking capacitively a superconducting grain to two normal leads and to a gate electrode as well@xcite .",
    "the latter allows one to control the number @xmath0 of electrons on the grain by tuning the gate voltage @xmath1 . such a system has been studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite@xcite@xcite in great detail during the past years . in a normal island",
    "the parity of @xmath0 oscillates between even and odd values , by varying @xmath1 ; conversely in a superconducting island @xmath0 is always even because of the paired nature of the ground state . therefore the s - set transport properties in the linear regime are governed by andreev reflection under the critical temperature @xmath2 of the central island , while above @xmath2 single electron tunneling prevails .",
    "this leads to well pronounced coulomb blockade peaks of the conductance @xmath3 as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "in particular the parity - controlled tunneling produces @xmath4 periodic peaks in the pair - tunneling regime , in contrast with the @xmath5 periodicity of the normal system ( here @xmath6 is the capacity of the gate electrode ) .",
    "this behavior is well reproduced by models @xcite@xcite@xcite using a gate controlled bcs hamiltonian @xmath7 ; the connection to free electron leads employs a tunneling hamiltonian , usually treated by second - order perturbation theory .    in the present article",
    "we propose a model for a s - set with a strongly correlated , repulsive hubbard - like model instead of @xmath7 as the `` superconducting '' grain hamiltonian .",
    "that is , we look for a superconducting response entirely driven by the electronic correlations rather than by the phonon - mediated effective attraction .",
    "the occurrence of two - electron tunneling in non bcs systems was observed by ashoori _",
    "et al._@xcite in a @xmath8 m gaas tunnel capacitor .",
    "purely electronic mechanisms were proposed to explain this behavior and the gaas quantum dot models ranged from a semiclassical description@xcite to a hubbard model framework@xcite . unlike the systems considered by refs.@xcite @xcite , in our _ gedankenexperiment _ , like in a s - set , the tunneling current is due to many bound pairs hosted by the device in a wide range of gate potentials .",
    "the plane of the paper is the following .",
    "in the next section we introduce the microscopic model that we are going to study .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is devoted to determine some important properties of the strongly correlated central island .",
    "we show that the electronic correlations provide a non - trivial characteristic energy which can be compared with the electrostatic charging energy in order to distinguish between a _",
    "normal _ regime and a _ superconducting _ one .",
    "in particular in these two regimes the parity of the number of particles in the ground state oscillates exactly like in a s - set . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we explicitly calculate the conductance as a function of the gate voltage by using a master equation approach@xcite .",
    "it is found that the linear response of our strongly correlated device shows coulomb blockade pattern .",
    "a normal behavior is observed in the non - correlated and in the very strongly correlated regimes ; while in the intermediate case , the spacing between the conductance peaks doubles .",
    "finally the conclusions are drawn in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "let us consider the grand - canonical hamiltonian @xmath9 here @xmath10 is an extended hubbard model of the central island coupled capacitively to a gate voltage @xmath1 ; @xmath11 describes the left and right reservoirs , supposed to be identical free electron gases for simplicity ; @xmath12 is the tunneling hamiltonian , that connects the central device to the leads ; @xmath13 is the chemical potential and @xmath14 is the total number of particles operator .",
    "the carriers are electrons , of charge @xmath15 .",
    "let us examine these three terms in detail .",

    "each cluster is described by the hamiltonian @xmath23 with the creation operators on the @xmath21-th cluster @xmath24 for the central site , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 for the remaining 4 sites ; @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a spin index .    in the device , each cluster @xmath21",
    "is linked to the two nearest neighbors ones ( denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) by the hopping hamiltonian @xmath31 ( see fig.[device]@xmath32 ) whereby a particle in the @xmath33-th site of the @xmath21-th cluster can hop towards the @xmath33-th site of the @xmath34-th clusters : @xmath35 @xmath10 also contains an electrostatic charging energy term due to an effective capacitance @xmath36 of the central island . finally the island is connected capacitively to the gate which is at a potential @xmath1 ( see fig.[device]@xmath37 ) .",
    "therefore we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 is total number of particles operator in the central device .",
    "we remark that the capacitive term is essentially long - ranged and accounts for the monopole contribution to the charging energy , while the @xmath40 terms depend on the way the charges are distributed in the island . in all electrostatic terms",
    "@xmath39 should be referred to an average population corresponding to a neutral situation ; but , actually , any shift @xmath41 would produce a constant and a linear term in @xmath39 that just modifies @xmath42 .",
    "both leads are free electron gases with chemical potentials @xmath43 , @xmath44 ; hence @xmath45 with @xmath46@xcite where @xmath47 is the bias .",

    "note also that @xmath56 is independent of @xmath57 , in other terms we are using `` white '' wires , that is , leads that do not filter electrons according to the square symmetry of electronic states in each cluster .",
    "this is a simple way to ensure the 3d nature of the leads , which is essential to allow andreev reflection .    in the next section",
    "we draw some relevant properties of @xmath10 which mimic the behavior of @xmath7 despite the presence of strong electronic correlations .",
    "in order to understand the physics of the device that we propose , it is useful to foucus first on properties of @xmath50 , referred to a single 5-site cluster .",
