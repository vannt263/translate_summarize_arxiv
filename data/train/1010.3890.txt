    "many aspects of complex light - induced nonlinear orientational phenomena in liquid crystals have been investigated during the last few decades , with a particular emphasis on the dynamical richness arising from the strong light - matter coupling associated with the elastic and anisotropic optical properties of ordered mesophases @xcite . from the optical point of view , nematics are uniaxial media with the optical axis along the local average direction of the molecular axis called director , @xmath0 . depending on the boundary conditions and",
    "bulk ordering characteristics , a light - driven orientational instability may take place above a threshold intensity usually referred to as the optical fredericksz transition ( oft ) . besides their fundamental interest , the optically induced phenomena in liquid crystals seem to be finding their way for technological applications .",
    "it has been recently proposed @xcite to realize all - optical photonic switching devices using dielectric periodic structures infiltrated with homeotropically or planar aligned nematics .",
    "when considering a linearly polarized light field impinging at normal incidence onto a planar nematic cell , one should distinguish between two situations when the polarization plane is parallel or perpendicular to the initial director uniform distribution . in both cases ,",
    "twisted elastic reorientation modes appear above a light intensity threshold .",
    "the first one corresponds to the coherent polarization conversion process mediated by two - beam coupling between the incident extraordinary wave and a lower - frequency noisy ordinary component .",
    "the latter field component is due to scattering of the incident light by the director orientational fluctuations and experiences gain during the propagation of light throughout the cell @xcite .",
    "the second situation , which corresponds to an ordinary polarized incident light , is associated with the twist fredericksz transition . up to now , this particular case has only been considered theoretically because of the predicted threshold for orientational instability is turned out to be very high @xcite .",
    "recently , the twist oft has been revisited and it was shown that the stationary bifurcation solution derived in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid for optically thin nematic layers . indeed , for thicker films",
    ", the twisted oft takes place via a hopf bifurcation @xcite , which has not been demonstrated experimentally yet .",
    "it is worth noting that the planar geometry has attracted an interest following seemingly experimentally accessible intensity threshold using a periodic structure @xcite .    in this work , in an attempt to guide future experimental investigations we quantitatively estimate the influence of unavoidable back and forward light scattering on the twist oft threshold that are due to boundary refractive indices mismatch in any real sample .",
    "this effect is usually neglected , which is well justified for homeotropic alignment .",
    "however , when planar alignment is considered , the perfectly matching condition can be achieved only by utilizing anisotropic substrates .",
    "this is obviously an inconvenient solution in practice .",
    "our analysis reveals the crucial role of backward waves in the calculation of the threshold itself .",
    "we consider a linearly - polarized plane wave with wavelength @xmath1 impinging at normal incidence ( along @xmath2 ) on a planarly aligned nematic liquid crystal layer of a thickness @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1_setup ] ) .",
    "the unperturbed director @xmath4 lies along the @xmath5 axis and the light is polarized along the @xmath6 direction , i.e. we deal with an incident ordinary wave",
    ". theoretical description of optically induced orientational phenomena in nematics is a well - posed problem that consists of coupled nematodynamic and maxwell s equations for the light propagation inside the anisotropic medium @xcite .",
    "there are several common simplifications that are employed to solve these equations .",
    "first of all , fluid flow associated with the director reorientation ( backflow effect ) is neglected .",
    "indeed , flow plays only a passive role and in most known cases lead to slight quantitative differences only @xcite . in this study",
    "we neglect all transverse effects and assume that all variables depend solely on @xmath2 .",
    "it allows to simplify drastically the maxwell s equations .",
    "therefore , the light beam might be treated as a plane wave and any experiment aiming to verify the theoretical predictions should be performed by using a laser beam with a diameter much larger than the thickness of the nematic layer .",
    "the applicability of such a one - dimensional approximation has already been validated for homeotropic nematic samples , with @xmath7 .",
    "it turned out that it also works rather well for the beam diameters of the order of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "importantly , the realization of spatially inhomogeneous transverse structures in the @xmath8 plane is hardly probable .",
    "as was shown in @xcite in the limit of thin layers , it is a case only for strongly anisotropic ratio between elastic constants which is not a case for common nematics . next , we assume that the director always keeps planar orientation at the boundaries ( strong anchoring conditions ) , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce the representation adapted to our geometry in terms of the spherical angles @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "however , as follows from the simulations , the director reorients in the @xmath13 plane only for the all the regimes explored in the present study .",
    "therefore @xmath14 and the director is described by the twist angle @xmath15 only . such a situation is intuitively expected because the light should transmit a lot of energy to deform the director across the layer .",
    "the strong boundary conditions in terms of the twist angle read @xmath16",
    "we first neglect the effect of reflection at the boundaries @xmath17 ( ideally matched conditions ) and calculate the thresholds by performing the linear stability analysis of the planar state .",
    "we eventually obtain the following integro - differential equation for @xmath15 @xcite @xmath18dz ' \\right)\\!.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the dimensionless incident light intensity with @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 is the phase delay between @xmath22- and @xmath23-waves through the whole layer with birefringence @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are refractive indices of the @xmath23 and @xmath22 waves , respectively . here",
    "we introduce the normalized length @xmath27 and time @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a characteristic relaxation time with the rotational viscosity @xmath30 and the twist frank elastic constant @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we perform then the linear stability analysis writing @xmath32 and inserting the expansion @xmath33 into eq .",
    "( [ dir_eq_f_zero ] ) with further projection on @xmath34 ( galerkin method ) .",
    "the resulting eigenvalue problem is solved then numerically ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the analysis shows that the primary instability of the planar state is a stationary bifurcation only below a critical value @xmath35 of the phase delay and a hopf bifurcation otherwise , as indicated by the blue dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_scatt ] .",
    "we notice that the symmetry @xmath36 is spontaneously broken at the threshold in former case . the change from stationary to hopf bifurcation",
    "is accompanied by a jump of the threshold intensity @xcite .",
    "as a next step , we consider realistic boundary conditions at @xmath17 , namely an isotropic dielectric material that sandwiches the nematic layer with refractive index @xmath37 . for convenience , we introduce the labels @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the first ( @xmath40 , incident side ) and the second ( @xmath41 , transmitted side ) semi - infinite surrounding dielectric material , and @xmath42 for the nematic layer .",
    "the modified linear equation requires a derivation of the expressions for the @xmath23 and @xmath22 waves inside nematic to the first order in @xmath15 that account for backward waves contributions .",
    "this is done by using the berremen s formalism @xcite , when the maxwell equations are cast in the matrix form for the four component vector @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 , @xmath45 are the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , that vary slowly in time compared to @xmath48 .",
    "the vector @xmath49 then can be written as a superposition of the four proper electromagnetic waves ( two forward- and two backward - propagating ) propagating across the layer ( @xmath50 ) with the same value @xmath51 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath42 media ( oldano s formalism @xcite ) , namely @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the matrix whose columns are eigenvectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the vector of amplitudes @xmath56 .    the vector of amplitudes @xmath55 at the left side of the first boundary plane ( @xmath57 ) and at the right side of the second boundary plane ( @xmath58 ) can be written as @xmath59 the scattering problem consists of expressing the amplitudes @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 of the reflected and transmitted @xmath22- and @xmath23 waves as a function of the amplitude @xmath64 of the incident @xmath23-wave .",
    "the continuity of the tangential components at @xmath17 of the vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 requires @xmath67 so that we can write @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are as follows @xmath71 due to the boundary conditions for the director we have @xmath72 given by @xmath73 the evolution of the electromagnetic field inside nematic can be written by introducing the propagation matrix @xmath74 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 here @xmath77 and @xmath78 finally , a set of four independent equations that allows to express @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 as a function of @xmath64 is derived @xmath79 in general , the resulting expressions for the reflected and transmitted waves @xmath80 and @xmath63 are cumbersome , however , it is instructive to consider the particular case @xmath81 that simplifies the algebra a lot and gives @xmath82\\phi(z)\\,dz } { q^2e^{-i \\pi q\\delta}-e^{i \\pi \\delta } } , \\\\",
    "\\label{t2 } r_o&=&0 , \\\\\\nonumber t_e&=&\\dfrac{ia_0q\\delta e^{\\frac{i}{2 } \\pi \\delta(q-1)}\\int_0^\\pi\\left[q e^{-i\\delta z}+e^{i\\delta q z}\\right]\\phi(z)\\,dz } { q^2e^{-i \\pi q\\delta}-e^{i \\pi \\delta } } , \\\\\\nonumber t_o&=&a_0 e^{-\\frac{i}{2 } \\pi \\delta(q-1)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 . as is expected , @xmath84 because an incident ordinary wave is perfectly matched ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "thus the @xmath23 wave is entirely transmitted acquiring only the phase according to eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) .",
    "next , we determine the light field distribution inside nematic by integrating the equations for the amplitudes @xmath85 , since the initial condition @xmath86 is found . finally , the linearized expression for the electromagnetic term can then be calculated , leading to the following integro - differential equation for @xmath15 @xmath87dz'+ \\delta\\cdot im[f(z ) ] \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 describes the contribution of the backward waves .",
    "then , the stability analysis procedure is similar to the case of ideal boundary conditions ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec_id_bc ] ) . in the particular case",
    "@xmath81 , the latter function writes explicitly @xmath89\\phi(z)\\,dz\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_scatt ] where primary instability threshold is plotted in the @xmath90 plane with ( solid curves , for the two cases @xmath81 and @xmath91 ) and without ( dashed curve ) taking into account the contribution of backward waves generated at the nematic boundaries .",
    "the presence of backward waves has a clear qualitative effect , namely , the oscillation of the threshold with respect to the phase delay @xmath92 of the nematic layer .",
    "such an oscillation is driven by the dependence of the function @xmath88 on @xmath92 . in the case",
    "@xmath81 , the resulting oscillation has a period @xmath93 [ see eq .",
    "( [ fun_f ] ) ] .",
    "it corresponds to a period of @xmath94 when considering the dependence of the threshold versus thickness @xmath3 .",
    "the fact of oscillations itself emphasizes the interference between forward and backward propagating waves to be at the origin of the modulation of the threshold .",
    "accordingly , the modulation depth drastically increases when the refractive index contrast at the nematic boundaries is increased , as shown when taking @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_scatt ] ) . to conclude this section ,",
    "let us note that in a practical situation the representative case will correspond to @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , a sample is typically made of a nematic slab sandwiched into two glass substrates ( with refractive index @xmath96 ) surrounded with air , hence we expect the air / glass interfaces to control the modulation of the oft threshold , which therefore corresponds qualitatively to the case @xmath91 .",
    "we report on the effect of back- and forward scattering on the fredericksz transition in a nematic layer with planar alignment .",
    "the light intensity and the phase delay induced by the layer are the control parameters of the system .",
    "we demonstrate that the primary threshold exhibits oscillations with the phase delay .",
    "this effect is especially important when the jump of refractivity index at the boundaries of nematic layer occurs .",
