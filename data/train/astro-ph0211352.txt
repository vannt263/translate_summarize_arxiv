    "recent observations show that there is a substantial amount of _ intracluster stellar population _ , which is observed as diffuse intracluster light ( @xcite ) , or as individual stars , _ i.e. , _ planetary nebulae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and red giant stars ( @xcite ; see also the review by @xcite )    the presence of this intracluster stellar population is expected from dynamical processes which unbind stars from galaxies , as predicted by interactions among galaxies ( harassment ) in a cluster potential ( @xcite ) . however , it is also possible that some stars were formed in more or less uniform intracluster matter before the matter was assembled in individual galaxies , or as the protogalaxies were falling in the cluster potential ( @xcite ) . those stars ,",
    "if present , would have the properties similar to those of the hypothetical population iii .",
    "detection and a quantitative estimate of the amount of such a hypothetical population would have a profound impact on our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "+ the presence of a diffuse stellar component in clusters is relevant also for the ongoing discussion of the baryonic mass in clusters ( @xcite ) and the efficiency of star formation ( @xcite ) . to account for the diffuse component",
    ", the total baryonic mass of a galaxy cluster , @xmath6 , should be written as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the mass of stars and interstellar matter which reside in galaxies , @xmath9 is the mass of hot intracluster gas , and @xmath10 is the mass of intracluster stars .",
    "so far , @xmath10 was neglected , while recent studies argue that it may be a significant fraction of the total baryonic mass , at least 15% and perhaps much more ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in order to address the origin and constraint the amount of the intracluster stellar population , we need to establish the properties of this population of stars .",
    "intracluster planetary nebulae ( icpne ) are excellent tracers of the intracluster stellar population ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "searches for icpne were carried out so far using a narrow band filter centered on the [ oiii ] @xmath11 line ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . however , the first spectroscopic follow - up carried out on a subsample of icpne candidates selected via this technique showed a significant amount of contamination ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one class of contaminants consists of continuum objects misclassified as line - emitters because of photometric errors .",
    "the other class includes high redshift line emitters such as [ oii ] starbursts at @xmath12 and ly@xmath13 emitters at @xmath14 .",
    "contamination by continuum objects can be solved by taking an adequate off - band images , but reducing contamination from high - z line emitters is a much more difficult problem .    to overcome the latter problem",
    ", we made a search for icpne in the virgo cluster using two narrow band filters centered on the redshifted [ oiii ] line and h@xmath13 line , the strongest and the second strongest emission line respectively from a pn , with the suprime - cam on the 8.2 m subaru telescope .",
    "such a challenging program can be carried out only with an 8 meter telescope equipped with a wide - field imager because h@xmath13 emission from a pn is @xmath15 times weaker than the strongest @xmath16 5007 [ oiii ] green line .",
    "we present in this letter the first results of our ongoing survey and the list of secure candidates for icpne in the core of the virgo cluster , together with their finding charts .",
    "new estimates are provided for the lower limit of the intracluster stellar population and the fraction of baryonic matter in the virgo cluster core .",
    "extensive discussion of the candidate selection criteria and the results of the spectroscopic follow up are given in @xcite .",
    "in march - april 2001 , a field in the central region of the virgo cluster was observed during the commissioning of the suprime - cam 10k@xmath178k mosaic ccd camera ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) at the prime focus of the 8.2 m subaru telescope .",
    "the camera covered an area of @xmath0 with a resolution of @xmath18 per pixel.4k chip was dead in the march run . ]",
    "the field is just south of m84-m86 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 : j2000 ) .",
    "the field was imaged through two narrow band filters which have ( @xmath21 , @xmath22)=(5021@xmath23 , 74@xmath23 ) and ( 6607@xmath23 , 101@xmath23 ) , corresponding to the redshifted [ oiii ] and h@xmath13 lines , respectively .",
    "two standard broad band filters ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) were also used to check the intensity in the adjacent continuum .",
    "total exposure times are 900 sec , 720 sec , 3600 sec , and 8728 sec for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , [ oiii ] , and h@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the seeing was slightly better for the narrow bands ( @xmath24 ) than for the broad bands ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "data reductions , including an astrometric solution , were carried out with a data reduction package developed by the suprime - cam team . all the reduced images in the same band were coadded and normalized to 1 sec exposure .",
    "we then used a combined ( @xmath26 ) continuum image , following the procedure adopted by @xcite to check for any emission in the continuum .",
    "we use sextractor ( @xcite ) to carry out the detection and photometry . because the [ oiii ] image is the deepest",
    ", we perform the source detection on the [ oiii ] image and then compute aperture magnitudes for the h@xmath13 and @xmath27 images at the location of the [ oiii]-detected objects .",
    "our selection criteria are based on our instrumental magnitudes .",
    "limiting magnitudes and detection limits are derived from the simulation described in @xcite , and shown in table 1 .",
    "the former is the magnitude at which 50% of the input sample is retrieved from the simulated image , while the latter is the magnitude at which the fraction of retrieved point sources becomes zero .",
    ".limiting magnitudes and detection limits in the instrumental magnitudes [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that the identification of pne in individual galaxies via the on - off band technique and the `` by - eye '' identification produce catalogues with a significant fraction , 39% and 56% in m84 and m86 respectively , of continuum objects and line emitters with detected continuum , which we know can not be true pne .",
    "table 3 summarizes the secure candidates of icpne identified in this study , _",
    "i.e. , _ those which are classified as ( a ) and are located outside of @xmath28 areas centered on m84 , m86 and ngc 4388 , where @xmath29 is the effective radius in which a half of the total muminosity is included .",
    "over - luminous objects in the m84 fields are also included because they may be icpne on the near side of the cluster , according to @xcite .",
    "distribution the icpn candidates projected on the sky is shown in figure 1 on our deep [ oiii ] image .",
    "the lower left area bounded by the black line indicates the area excluded from our survey because of the dead ccd chip .",
    "figure 1 shows a remarkably inhomogeneous distribution of the icpn candidates .",
    "even when the over - luminous objects are not considered , the overdensity in the upper right quadrant of our field is highly significant .",
    "the majority of the candidates seem to be related with the m86-m84 region of the virgo cluster , which suggests a local origin for the icpne .",
    "they may be bound in the halos of these galaxies , or they may have become unbound from these galaxies while they are falling into the virgo cluster ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) . if the latter is the case , the highly inhomogeneous distribution is possibly a hint of a very recent harassment event .",
    "there are also several candidates which do not seem to be associated with bright galaxies .",
    "two of the three dominant galaxies have radial velocities largely different from the mean velocity of the virgo cluster ( 1050@xmath3035 kms@xmath31 ; @xcite ) ; m84 ( 1060 kms@xmath31 ) , m86 ( @xmath32 ) , and ngc 4388 ( 2524 ) .",
    "a spectroscopic follow up and a wider survey are badly needed to clarify the nature of the parent stellar population of icpne .",
    "figure 2 presents the finding charts of the 38 candidates .",
    "our goal is to estimate the fraction of diffuse light coming from the intracluster stellar population and the baryonic fraction in the virgo cluster core , where we have our survey data .",
    "the crucial parameter in this evaluation is the pn specific frequency parameter @xmath33 which gives the number of pne per unit stellar b luminosity within the first 1.0 mag of the bright end cut off of the [ oiii ] pn luminosity function , as selected according to our criteria .",
    "there is no theoretical prediction for its value which may well depend on the age / metallicity of the stellar population from which the pne originate .",
    "its value has always been derived so far from empirical measurements . @xcite",
    "estimated the parameter using 45 pne in m84 as @xmath34 in what follows , we adopt the distance of the virgo cluster of d=15 mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 36 icpn candidates in our field excluding i-24 and i-33 imply a total associated luminosity of @xmath35 .",
    "however , some fraction of our candidates may still turn out to be high redshift line emitters . for this relatively bright sample selected from both [ oiii ] and h@xmath13 images ,",
    "the fraction of high - z contaminants is probably much less than the 25% found by @xcite for an [ oiii]-only selected sample . in order to derive a secure lower limit",
    ", we reduce the associated luminosity to @xmath36 based on the very conservative estimate .",
    "the area surveyed by the suprime - cam is 0.196 deg@xmath37 .",
    "thus , the distance independent surface brightness of the diffuse light is @xmath38 mag arcsec@xmath39 .",
    "next , we need to compare this with the light from the virgo galaxies . if the intracluster stellar population is closely related to the local density of galaxies , we should compare the diffuse light with the light of three galaxies , m86(@xmath40=9.83mag ) , m84(10.09 ) , and ngc4388(11.76 ) , which dominates the galaxy light in our field ( @xmath41 in total ) .",
    "this comparison gives an estimate of 9% as the fraction of diffuse light to galaxy light .",
    "on the other hand , if the population is a large - scale phenomenon , we should compare its surface brightness with the smoothed - out surface brightness of virgo galaxies . in this case",
    ", we would have a substantially larger fraction .",
    "it is , however , difficult to derive a reliable value with our small sample .",
    "since the inhomogeneous distribution seems to favor a local phenomenon , we take the value of @xmath4210% . under the assumption that the intracluster stellar population has the same mass - to - luminosity ratio as galaxies , @xmath10 in equation ( 1 ) is thus @xmath4210% of @xmath8 .",
    "now , we proceed to the estimate of @xmath9 and the total gravitating mass , @xmath43 , to derive the baryonic fraction .",
    "@xcite made a detailed analysis of smoothed - out distributions of galaxies and hot gas .",
    "they decomposed the distribution into three subclusters identified around m87 , m86 , and m49 ( ngc4472 ) .",
    "they present the density profile of the main m87 subcluster separately for hot gas , galaxies and total gravitating mass ( their fig.11b ) .",
    "we read from their plot the relative contribution of respective components _ at the position of our field _ as @xmath44=60:8:3    at the position of our field which is closer to m86 , the contribution to @xmath45 from the m86 subcluster is 2.2 times that from the m87 subcluster ( their fig .",
    "they found a compact x - ray halo around m86 subcluster .",
    "it is , however , interpreted as interstellar matter stripped from m86 by ram pressure .",
    "if this is the case , the gas is already counted as @xmath45 .",
    "accordingly , we do not increase @xmath46 due to the m86 halo .",
    "we adopt a constant mass - to - light ratio of @xmath47=10 ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) for all the galaxies instead of 20 adopted by @xcite .",
    "this halves the value of @xmath45 with respect to other components .",
    "finally , we have @xmath44=60:8:4.8(=(3 + 2.2@xmath173)/2 ) .    with the contribution from the intracluster stellar population estimated here , we have @xmath48 for the relative contribution , though @xmath49 has a relatively large uncertainty .",
    "therefore , if this field in the virgo core is typical for the whole cluster , about a half ( = 5.5/13.5 ) of the baryons associated with the cluster formed stars , and the fraction of baryonic matter is about 18% ( = 13.5/73.5 ) . with the value @xmath50 for @xmath51 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath52 for total gravitating mass .",

    "<S> broad - band images in @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands are used to check for any emissions in the adjacent continuum . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the method briefly and present the list of intracluster planetary nebulae candidates , together with their finding charts . </S>",
    "<S> the icpn candidates show a highly inhomogeneous distribution , which may suggest an association with the m86-m84 subcluster . </S>",
    "<S> fraction of diffuse intracluster light with respect to total light in galaxies is estimated to be about @xmath5 , leading to an estimate of about 20% for the baryon fraction . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic follow up and a wider survey are critical to reveal the nature of intracluster stellar population . </S>"
