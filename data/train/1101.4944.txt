    "figure 1 shows the co - added image of all acis - s exposures ( 237.1 ks in total ) of the core of m28 in the 0.52 kev band ( where most of the emission from msps is expected ) , with 1@xmath23 circles centered on the 12 current best radio pulsar timing positions ( s.  bgin , et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "it is apparent that the unresolved diffuse emission in the shallower acis - s observations reported by @xcite is mostly resolved into multiple faint sources , with some apparently coinciding with the known radio pulsars in m28 . to formally identify the x - ray counterparts to the pulsars",
    ", we used the ciao tool wavdetect , which correlates the image with mexican - hat wavelets of various scales to identify sources .",
    "we also used the pwdetect script @xcite , which is generally more effective at identifying faint sources near much brighter sources .",
    "subsequently , we employed the idl script acis_extract @xcite to confirm the validity of the source detections reported by wavdetect and pwdetect and refine the source positions .",
    "for psr b182124 ( henceforth msp a , m28 a , or pulsar a ) we find an offset between the radio pulsar position from @xcite and the known x - ray counterpart of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in right ascension and declination , respectively .",
    "thus we apply this correction to the astrometric frame of the x - ray dataset , which results in significantly better matches between most of the radio msps and x - ray sources .",
    "the positional uncertainties of the detected x - ray sources were computed using the empirical relation from @xcite , which yields the @xmath26% error radius , @xmath27 .",
    "we note that the uncertainties in the radio timing positions for the m28 pulsars are generally @xmath210.1@xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the dominant source of uncertainty in the x - ray counterpart matches is the error in the x - ray source position , with the exception of pulsars d and i. pulsar d is significantly younger ( based on its characteristic age @xmath28 myr ) then the other pulsars in m28 and has a comparatively long spin period of @xmath29 ms . as such , it exhibits more timing noise , resulting in an uncertainty in its radio position , especially in declination , comparable to @xmath27 ( @xmath7@xmath30 ) .",
    "the error ellipse shown in figure 1 was obtained by doubling the formal uncertainties in the pulsar position obtained with tempo . in the case of msp",
    "i , the presence of random and irregular radio eclipses , apparent long - term variations in the orbital motion , and infrequent detections of the pulsar pose major difficulties in deriving a unique phase - connected timing solution and thus a precise radio timing position ( see s.  bgin et al . in preparation , for details ) .",
    "thus , the error ellipse shown in figure 1 , taken to be five times the formal position uncertainty derived from a tempo fit with a @xmath31 over 7 , represents the current best estimate of the location of pulsar i , which may be subject to significant change .",
    "we note that the best timing fit of the eclipsing binary msp h also has a large @xmath31 , implying that the uncertainties in the position reported by tempo are not realistic estimates of the true errors .",
    "fortunately , the recent identification of its optical counterpart by @xcite provides a much more reliable localization of m28h .    as evident from figure 1 and table 2 , msps a , c , h , j , and k are found well within the 95% error circles of x - ray sources , with differences between the x - ray and radio positions of @xmath210.24@xmath23 .",
    "thus we deem the x - ray identifications of these pulsars as secure . for pulsar d",
    ", a single x - ray source falls within the radio timing error ellipse . as the source",
    "is found away from the crowded cluster core , it is most likely the x - ray counterpart to the pulsar .",
    "pulsar f is located just 0.04@xmath23 outside of @xmath27 of the sole x - ray source in the vicinity , suggesting that the two are related .",
    "it is likely that the small positional discrepancy is due to a slight rotational offset between the x - ray and radio astrometric frames .",
    "however , as pulsar a is the only bright x - ray source with a radio counterpart in this field , it is not possible to unambiguously correct for this effect .",
    "pulsar e is found 0.12@xmath23 outside of the 95% error circle of the nearest x - ray source . as this msp",
    "is located in the crowded cluster core , this association is less certain . although faint emission is coincident with the position of msp b , the source detection algorithms fail to identify an x - ray counterpart to this pulsar .",
    "the detection of msp i is rendered difficult by its position between msp k and one of the brightest sources in the cluster ( 23 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the centroid of the x - ray counterpart to pulsar k is nearly coincident with its radio position ( @xmath320.03@xmath23 ) , implying that pulsar i is either significantly fainter than k or is not at the location derived from radio timing .",
    "msp l is nearly coincident with a moderately luminous x - ray source ( 22 in * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed in  6 , however , based on the properties of this pulsar as inferred from radio observations and the temporal behavior of the x - ray emission from source 22 , the two objects are most likely not physically associated . for msp g , three x - ray sources are found @xmath71@xmath23 away ( see figure 1 ) , making the x - ray - radio association ambiguous as the x - ray photons coincident with its radio position may be due to collective emission from the three nearby x - ray sources .",
    "it is also difficult to reliably constrain the intrinsic pulsar flux as there is no appropriate region from which to extract a representative background .",
    "consequently , in order to place a crude upper limit on the flux , we extracted source counts within 1  of the radio position .    given the high x - ray source number density in the cluster core , it is important to investigate the possibility that x - ray sources coincide with most of the radio pulsar positions purely by chance ( with the exception of m28 a , for which the radio  x - ray association is well established ) .",
    "we have applied systematic offsets in the range @xmath33 in all directions of the radio pulsar positions with respect to the x - ray dataset .",
    "we find that any offset consistently results in two or less source matches .",
    "the same holds true for all angles of rotation of the radio pulsar positions about the cluster center or about the position of pulsar a. this finding suggests that the majority of the radio  x - ray source matches are indeed genuine and is consistent with pulsars l and/or g being possible false matches .",
    "table 2 summarizes the background - subtracted x - ray net source counts extracted from polygonal regions that enclose @xmath790% of the total energy at 1.5 kev for the putative x - ray counterparts of the pulsars .",
    "for msps i and b , for which no x - ray counterparts are detected , we extracted source counts from circles of radius 1.7  ( enclosing 95% of the energy at 1.5 kev ) centered on the radio timing positions .",
    "the background event contribution was determined from 1.7  circles that are the same radial distance from source 23 @xcite as the msps . in both cases",
    "the net source counts are consistent with zero .    for the x - ray - faint pulsars",
    "( c , d , e , f , j , and k ) , we estimate the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity by fitting a powerlaw spectrum with @xmath34 @xmath11 using the cash statistic @xcite in xspec .",
    "this particular spectral model was chosen because it reproduces the rough spectral shape of a two - temperature thermal model observed in nearby msps @xcite quite well for crude photon statistics , with spectral photon index in the range @xmath35 . in the case of msps a , g , h , and",
    "l the luminosities were derived from the spectral fits discussed in  4 and 5 , although for g and l these values most probably do not correspond to the intrinsic pulsar values as a consequence of source confusion / blending .",
    "we note that in the combined _ chandra _ hrc - s data ( totaling 90 ks ) , of the 12 pulsars only pulsar a is detected , owing to the @xmath73 times lower sensitivity at 0.5 - 3 kev and the higher background of hrc compared to acis .",
    "psr b182124 is the first msp to be discovered in a globular cluster @xcite . this solitary pulsar with @xmath36 ms ,",
    "@xmath37 s s@xmath1 , is @xmath7100 times younger than most `` recycled '' msps , based on its characteristic age ( @xmath38 myr ) .",

    "* ) , 23 orders of magnitude greater than typical msps . only two other x - ray detected msps , psrs b1937 + 21 and j0218 + 4232 ( both field msps ) , have comparable values of @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "because of the bright nature of m28 a , @xmath74% of the x - ray photons from this source in the acis - s observations are expected to suffer from pileup ( based on pimms ) .",
    "pileup occurs when two or more photons arrive within the same detector pixel within a single acis frame integration time and are registered as a single event .",
    "the detected energy of such an event is approximately equal to the sum of the energies of the individual photon events of which it is comprised .",
    "the result is a distortion of the intrinsic source spectrum @xcite . to ascertain the severity of this effect we have included the pileup model provided in xspec in our spectral fits .",
    "we find that pileup has negligible impact on the spectrum of psr b182124 , as the best fit values of the model parameters with and without pileup are well within 1@xmath42 of one another . based on this , in what follows ,",
    "we ignore the effect of pileup .",

    "may have heated magnetic polar caps . as a result",
    ", low - level thermal emission could be present in the predominantly non - thermal spectrum of psr b182124 . introducing either a blackbody or hydrogen atmosphere model ( nsatmos from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with temperatures in the range @xmath48 k yields acceptable fits , although given the high - quality of the pure power - law fit , the addition of the thermal component is not warranted by the data ( as confirmed by an f - test ) .",
    "this allows us to set a firm upper bound on any thermal component of @xmath71% of the total energy flux in the 0.38 kev range .",
    "the implied thermal luminosity of @xmath21@xmath49 ergs s@xmath1 is comparable to most nearby msps @xcite and those in 47 tuc @xcite . on the other hand , in some theoretical pulsar models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the energetics of the magnetosphere of psr b182124 may not be conducive to the production of a substantial return current of particles to heat the polar cap surface so this pulsar may in fact have much cooler polar caps .",
    "@xcite have reported intriguing but marginal evidence ( at 98% confidence ) for a broad emission feature centered at 3.3 kev , which they interpreted as cyclotron emission from the magnetosphere above the pulsar polar cap if the magnetic field strongly deviates from a centered dipole .",
    "we have reprocessed the archival acis - s data using the latest chandra x - ray center calibration products and find no evidence of this feature . as seen from figure 2 ,",
    "the broad spectral feature is absent in the total acis - s spectrum as well .",
    "therefore , we attribute the deviation from a pure power - law of the psr b182124 spectrum found by @xcite to an unmodelled instrumental feature that has since been incorporated into the telescope calibration model .",
    "the bulk of x - rays from psr b182124 ( @xmath785% ) are emitted in two very narrow pulses @xcite , indicative of highly beamed , non - thermal radiation from the pulsar magnetosphere , in stark contrast with the broad , soft thermal pulsations of most msps @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , @xcite have found an appreciable unpulsed component , contributing @xmath715% of total photon flux .",
    "using the two hrc - s timing observations of psr b182124 we can place constraints on the origin of the puzzling unpulsed emission . to this end , we combined the pulse profiles from the two hrc datasets as follows .",
    "we first folded the barycentered arrival times of the events extracted from a 1@xmath23 region centered on the radio pulsar in tempo using the timing ephemeris from @xcite for each dataset separately .",
    "due to the @xmath73.5-year gap between the two hrc - s observations it is not possible to phase - connect the two datasets accurately using the available radio timing ephemerides .",
    "thus , to determine the relative phase misalignment , we cross - correlated the folded pulse profiles from both observations . the individual and combined pulse profiles are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the summed hrc - s pulse profile yields 706 photons , a 1.8-fold improvement in photon statistics over the data from @xcite . of these ,",
    "@xmath50 photons are due to background . as in @xcite ,",
    "the unpulsed ( dc ) level in the summed profile was determined by considering the emission @xmath51 in phase away from the peaks of the two pulsas to minimize the contribution from the pulsed component . after subtracting the background contribution",
    ", we find that @xmath52 of the source photons are unpulsed . varying the choice of phase intervals used to determine the unpulsed level results in a spread of @xmath53% around the nominal value .",
    "although the hrc has poor intrinsic energy resolution , in principle , it is still possible to determine any gross difference between the spectra of the pulsed and unpulsed emission using hardness ratios .",
    "the hardness ratios , however , do not show any substantial differences in the spectra of the pulsed and unpulsed portions , implying that the unpulsed emission is not drastically softer or harder than the pulsed emission .",
    "nonetheless , the high - quality phase - integrated acis - s continuum provides stringent constraints on the spectral properties of the unpulsed emission , in particular , if it is of a thermal nature or not .",
    "the best - fit absorbed power - law model derived from the acis - s spectrum , convolved with the hrc - s effective area curve , reveals that the bulk of photons from psr b182124 in the hrc - s datasets are from the 0.42 kev range .",
    "we fitted the acis - s spectrum with additional thermal components to determine their photon flux contribution in this energy range . converting the resulting values to the equivalent hrc - s count rates",
    "indicates that any thermal emission can contribute no more than @xmath76% of the total number of photons from m28 a in the hrc - s observations .",
    "this leaves at least @xmath7715% of the photons unaccounted for .",
    "it is interesting to speculate on the origin of this excess unpulsed emission . in many young , energetic pulsars , with the crab pulsar being the most notable example @xcite",
    ", the high - energy non - thermal pulse profiles often exhibit a `` bridge '' of emission connecting two pulses , suggesting that the two pulses originate from the same emission cone .",
    "however , for psr b182124 the count rates in the regions between the two pulses are consistent with being identical .",
    "the apparent lack of excess of photons in one of the regions implies that bridge emission is not responsible for the seemingly unpulsed photons .",
    "it should be noted however that both pulses exhibit tails of emission from their trailing edges ( see bottom panel of figure 4 ) , which could plausibly extend to cover most of the rotational period .",
    "indeed , certain high - energy emission models of pulsars , such as the two - pole caustic model , predict low - level non - thermal magnetospheric emission spanning the entire period of rotation @xcite .",
    "a plausible alternative origin for the unpulsed photons is synchrotron emission from an unresolved wind nebula surrounding this rather energetic pulsar . by analogy with pulsars with comparable spin - down luminosities",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , the expected angular size of a wind nebula surrounding pulsar m28 a , assuming a distance of 5.5 kpc , would be @xmath71@xmath23",
    ". such a nebula would be difficult to resolve , especially considering the source crowding in the cluster core .",
    "if the unpulsed emission arises solely due to the wind nebula , its implied x - ray luminosity is @xmath54 ergs s@xmath1 , similar to what is observed for other energetically comparable pulsars ( see in particular tables 1 and 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "conceivably , the unpulsed emission could be caused by small - angle scattering of x - rays passing through dust grains in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the additional path length of the scattered x - rays would induce a time delay in the photon time of arrival , causing them to become out of phase relative to the unscattered photons and thus form an unpulsed component .",
    "this effect could also account for the trailing tails of the two pulses .",
    "the location of m28 in the galactic disk ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) suggests that dust scattering is not neglegible .",
    "we estimate the optical depth to scattering using the empirical relation @xmath57 @xcite , where @xmath58 is the visual interstellar extinction . for @xmath59 mag towards m28 @xcite , this yields @xmath60 implying that @xmath61% of the x - ray photons undergo scattering .",
    "finally , it is possible that at least a portion of the unpulsed component from psr b1821 - 24 is due to one or more fainter , unrelated x - ray sources within @xmath71@xmath23 of psr b182124 .",

    "the variability is significant at a 4@xmath42 and 2.7@xmath42 level , respectively , based on a @xmath88 test .",
    "a kuiper test @xcite on the unbinned lightcurve , weighted to account for the non - uniform exposure across the orbit , indicates a @xmath89 ( 3.2@xmath42 ) probability that photons being drawn from a constant distribution would exhibit this level of non - uniformity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the minimum around @xmath90 in the x - ray lightcurve is roughly coincident with the position of the radio eclipse .",
    "moreover , the rough shape of the lightcurve is remarkably similar to those of the analogous binaries psrs j00247204w @xcite , j17405340 @xcite , and j1023 + 0038 @xcite .",
    "thus , the peculiar nature of the psr j18242452h binary system , the implied x - ray luminosity , relatively hard spectrum compared to most msps observed in x - rays , and the suggested variability at the binary period point to an intrabinary shock origin of the x - rays associated with this object .",
    "the minimum in the x - ray light curve at @xmath91 can be plausibly interpreted as a geometric occultation ( either partial or total ) of the shock by the secondary star .",
    "alternatively , it could arise due to relativistic beaming of the x - rays from the radiating particles in the shock . due to the limited photon statistics and",
    "the number of orbits covered ( @xmath76 ) it is difficult to establish whether the flux modulation is truly periodic and stable over many orbits .",
    "as seen in psr j00247204w @xcite , the orbital variation of the x - ray flux may actually evolve on timescales spanning from months to years .",
    "the @xmath710 times larger absorbing column towards m28 compared to 47 tuc and @xmath71.2 times greater distance make it more difficult to study soft x - ray sources such as thermal msps @xcite in a comparable exposure . as a result , most of the detected pulsars in m28 do not have adequate photon statistics for detailed spectral analyses .",
    "nonetheless , we can still constrain the origin of the observed x - rays by considering the summed spectrum of pulsars b , c , d , e , f , j , and k ( shown in figure 6 ) . indeed , the combined x - ray continuum of these seven pulsars is poorly described by a single - temperature thermal spectrum , while a pure power - law model requires @xmath92 cm @xmath93 for an acceptable fit , substantially higher than the value suggested by the fit to the spectrum of psr b182124 . a composite blackbody plus power - law model for @xmath94",
    "@xmath11 gives an acceptable fit with @xmath95 kev , @xmath96 km , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 for 10 degrees of freedom .",
    "note that a power - law component does not necessarily imply non - thermal emission since the superposition of several multi - temperature thermal msp spectra can produce this spectral shape for limited photon statistics @xcite .",
    "the derived unabsorbed flux of @xmath99 ergs @xmath11 s@xmath1 ( 0.38 kev ) implies a mean x - ray luminosity of @xmath100 ergs s@xmath1 for the seven pulsars or @xmath101 ergs s@xmath1 if we exclude pulsar b. for comparison , the mean unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of the 11 thermal msps in 47 tuc with unconfused and uncontaminated spectra is @xmath102 ergs s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the msp populations of the two clusters are quite similar in terms of x - ray properties .",
    "the non - detection of pulsars b and i implies that these pulsars may be below the sensitivity of the total acis - s exposure , with @xmath103 ergs s@xmath1 ( 0.38 kev ) , perhaps similar to the unusually sub - luminous psr b1257 + 12 with @xmath104 ergs s@xmath1 in the same energy band @xcite .",
    "the low luminosity of the non - recycled pulsar d is similar to those of comparably old nearby pulsars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for pulsars g and l , there are sufficient counts within 1@xmath23 to conduct spectral fitting and search for variability , although as noted in  3 , the association of this emission with the pulsars is questionable . for both sources ,",
    "the spectra are well described by an absorbed power - law model ( see table 3 and figure 4 ) . in the case of pulsar g",
    ", there is no statistically significant variability . as for psr j18242452l , the x - rays extracted from within 1@xmath23 of the radio timing position exhibit variability on time - scales of order hours . in addition",
    ", there is a substantial increase ( a factor of @xmath73 ) in the count rate from the three 2002 acis - s observations to the two observations in 2008 . in principle , such large - amplitude variability from an msp binary could arise due to interaction of the pulsar wind with gas from the companion star .",
    "however , this msp is not unusual and exhibits no radio eclipses , which are associated with intrabinary shocks in all known cases .",
    "therefore , the variable x - rays are most probably from source 22 from @xcite , which is not related to the pulsar .",
    "we have presented deep _ chandra _ observations of the sample of known pulsars in the globular cluster m28 .",
    "seven of the 12 known pulsars in the cluster are securely detected ( a , c , d , f , h , j , and k ) two are possibly detected ( e and g ) , while three are not detected ( b , l , and i ) .",
    "most of the msps firmly or possibly detected appear to be relatively faint and soft sources most likely due to thermal polar cap emission . in this sense , they appear to be akin to the majority of `` recycled '' msps in 47 tuc @xcite and the field of the galaxy @xcite , with soft spectra and @xmath105 ergs s@xmath1 ( 0.38 kev ) .",
    "this provides further evidence that in typical msps , both in globular clusters and the field of the galaxy , the x - ray emission is primarily of a thermal nature . as shown by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , realistic modelling of the x - ray spectra and pulsations of these objects",
    "may potentially allow stringent constraints on the neutron star equation of state through measurement of the mass - to - radius ratio of these stars.as such , msps warrant further investigation in the x - ray band .    the most detailed x - ray spectrum to date of the energetic psr b182124",
    "is found to be well described by a pure power - law with @xmath106 , with no requirements for additional components .",
    "we set a limit on any thermal x - ray emission from the msp of @xmath21@xmath49 ergs s@xmath1 for 0.38 kev .",
    "the greatly improved acis - s spectrum of this pulsar shows no evidence for the previously reported spectral feature at @xmath73.3 kev .",
    "a re - examination of the x - ray pulse profile of psr b182124 reveals that the observed unpulsed emission is unlikely to be of thermal origin and is due to either low - level non - thermal magnetospheric emission , unresolved nebular emission , and/or dust scattering of the pulsed x - rays .",
    "psr j18242452h appears to share common x - ray characteristics ( namely , variable and hard non - thermal emission with @xmath107 ergs s@xmath1 ) with psrs j00247204w , j1023 + 0039 , and j17405340 .",
    "presumably , in these peculiar binary systems the x - rays originate from an intrabinary ( synchrotron ) x - ray emitting shock formed by interaction of the msp wind and matter from the secondary star @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this class of objects exhibits remarkably similar x - ray and optical properties to the accreting x - ray msps in quiescence @xcite and thus can potentially offer vital clues into the little understood activation mechanism for rotation - powered msps .",
