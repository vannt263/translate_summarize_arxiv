    "gravitational microlensing as one of the applications of general relativity is proposed by paczyski ( 1986 ) for detecting the dark compact halo objects so - called machos in the galactic halo .",
    "while not enough machos have been detected in the halo @xcite , however the microlensing technic has been used as an astrophysical tool for studying the atmosphere of the stars and exploring the exo - planets . in the standard method for exploring planets with the microlensing",
    ", a star with the companion planets can play the role of lens and produce caustic lines where crossing the caustics by the source star produces a high magnification on the light curve @xcite . in this case in addition to the standard microlensing light curve we can detect a short duration spark due to the caustic crossing , formed by the planet .",
    "a precise photometry of the event is essential to find out this short duration signature of the planet .",
    "the advantage of this technic compare to the other methods of the exo - planet detection is that it is sensitive to the observation of earth mass planets @xcite and also those planets located beyond the snow line @xcite .",
    "there is also other methods in gravitational microlensing such as planetary microlensing signals from the orbital motion of the source star around the common barycenter of source star  planet system @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mentioned methods , graff & gaudi ( 2000 ) proposed caustic crossing of a close - in jupiter size planet , produced by a binary lens . in this case the planet s light is magnified so much that it can be detected by a 10-m class telescope . here we extend this work looking to the details of the light curves and study the most favorite pass band for this observation . since in a close - in jupiter , the thermal emission due to the high temperature of the planet is more significant than the reflected light from the parent star , the observations in the infra - red pass band is more favorable than the visual pass band .",
    "we also do a monte - carlo simulation with a given observational strategy to obtain the number of observable events in terms of the parameters of the planet and the parent star .",
    "we emphasize that while the observations of the hot jupiters is simpler in nearby stars via the eclipsing and doppler methods , the microlensing method can detect distant systems and enable us to compare the statistics of the hot jupiters with the nearby observations .",
    "one of the interesting features of the light curve for the planet caustic crossing is that the planet can cross the caustic more than that of parent star , as it traces effectively a longer path due to the revolving motion around the parent star .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ lightcurve ]",
    "we will introduce the caustic crossing of the parent star and planet system and generate light curve with inverse ray shooting technic , introducing a new development in tree - code algorithm . in section [ char ]",
    "we study the characteristics of the light curve in terms of the orbital parameters of the planet and the parent star . in section [ mc ] we explain our monte - carlo simulation for estimating the probability of illuminating hot jupiters with this method . in section [ conc ]",
    "we give the conclusions .",
    "a binary system deflects the light ray with more complicated way than a single lens .",
    "let us represents @xmath1 as the position of the image in the lens plane and @xmath2 the position of the source in the source plane , the geometrical relation between these parameters is given by the lens equation as follows @xcite :    @xmath3    where underline represents the vector , @xmath4 is the overall deflection angle due to a double lens and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the distance of the source and lens from the observer and distance between the lens and source , respectively .",
    "the deflection angle for the light ray is given as follows @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the positions of the binary system in the lens plane and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are mass of the lenses . equation ( [ lense ] ) as the lens equation is a fifth order equation and in general the solution is not trivial .",
    "one of the possible solution for solving the lens equation is the inverse ray shooting method @xcite . in this method",
    "we follow the position of the light ray that shoots from the observer to the lens plane , knowing the position of the lenses we can calculate the deflection angle and substituting in the lens equation results in the position of the source .",
    "we pixelize the source and the lens plane and for each light ray passing from the lens plane and hitting the source plane , we count the number of hits inside each pixel .",
    "these numbers identify the magnification pattern in the source plane .",
    "we use tree code method as we describe it later , for generating the image and the magnification of the source star .    in order to simplify our calculation",
    "we take the dimensionless parameters in the lens equation .",
    "let us define the overall einstein radius as follows : @xmath13 we normalize the lens equation to this length scale , which results in : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the deflection angle is given by : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "we take a straight line for the path of the center of mass of the parent star and planet at the lens plane . taking the mass of parent star larger than the mass of planet",
    ", the parent star follows approximately a straight line as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is defined as the minimum impact parameter of source star from the center of the cartesian coordinate system , normalized to the einstein radius , @xmath22 is time of impact parameter , and @xmath23 is angle between @xmath24-axis and the trajectory of the source star .",
    "the rotation of the planet around the parent star makes an cycloid like pattern on the source plane which is given by : @xmath25\\hat{i}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\tilde{a}[\\cos(\\omega t+\\varphi)\\sin(\\alpha+\\beta)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\cos(\\delta)\\sin(\\omega t+\\varphi)\\cos(\\alpha+\\beta)]\\hat{j},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the projection of the planet orbit on the lens plane normalized to the einstein radius , @xmath27 is the angular velocity of planet around the source star which can be obtained from the kepler s third law : @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the orbital radius of the planet , @xmath30 is the deviation of the normal vector to the orbital plane of the planet from our line of sight .",
    "for the hot jupiters due to the tidal interaction of the planet and the parent star we set the eccentricity to zero and one angle is sufficient for describing the orbital plane deviation , @xmath31 is angle between the trajectory of the source star and the projected semi - major axis of the planet and @xmath32 is initial phase of the planet .    in order to generate the light curve , we need the relative velocity of the binary lens with the parent star and companion planet .",
    "the relative transverse velocity of the source - observer line of sight with respect to the lens at the lens plane is given by @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the two dimensional transverse velocities of the center of mass of the lens system , source and observer with respect to the line of sight respectively and @xmath37 is the ratio of the distance of the lens to the source .",
    "the velocity of the observer is obtained from the local measurements of the solar system in the galactic frame .",
    "the velocity of the stars in the bulge is given by the dispersion velocity in this structure and the velocity of the stars in the disk is obtained from the combination of the dispersion and global velocities of the stars @xcite .    since the lens is a binary system , that will rotate around the center of mass during the microlensing of the parent star and the companion planet .",
    "for simplify in our calculation we fix the position of the binary system and obtain the relative motion of the source objects with respect to the rotating binary system .",
    "the situation is similar to the studying of the motion of an object in rotating non - intertidal reference frame in the classical mechanics . in the reference frame of the binary system",
    "we do the following coordinate transformation for the position of the source object @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the angular velocity of the binary lens , which is given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the apparent separation of the two lenses from each other and @xmath42 is the deviation of the normal vector to the binary plane from the line of sight .    for generating the light curve we should note that there are two source objects , the parent star and the planet .",
    "the total flux receiving by the observer then is the accumulation of the magnified flux of each component @xcite : @xmath43 where the @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the intrinsic flux of the parent star and the planet and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the corresponding magnifications .",
    "let us define the ratio of the intrinsic flux of the planet to the flux of the parent star by @xmath48 which is much smaller than one ( i.e. @xmath49 ) .",
    "the total magnification can be written as : @xmath50 for a typical case of the binary lens and a main sequence parent star with an hot jupiter companion , the trajectory of the source in the source plane with the corresponding caustic lines is shown in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "one of the interesting features in the caustic crossing is that while the parent star crosses the caustic lines for two times , the planet due to the cyclic motion approach to the caustic lines more than that of the parent star .",
    "the corresponding light curve of the source and planet is shown in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) . even during the caustic crossing of the parent star in the first peak",
    ", the planet crosses twice the caustic lines . in order to distinguish the caustic crossing of the planet in the first peak , we zoom in around the first peak of the parent star which is given in the right corner of the figure ( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we note that the re - crossing of the caustic by the planet takes place with an interval time of about one hour and in order to detect this signal we need a sampling rate less than this time scale .    in the rest of this section",
    "we introduce the details in generation of the light curve in the numerical calculation .",
    "we should note that the tree code method used in our calculation is different than that introduced by barnes & hut ( 1986 ) and wambsganss ( 1999 ) . in their method",
    "the lenses in the lens plane are treated corresponding to their distances to the light ray . in that approach",
    "the process of making cells on the lens plane depends on the distance of the lenses to the light ray and their distribution . for the weak gravitational regime where the deflection angle is obtained from the superposition of each lenses ,",
    "the closer lenes enter to the calculation of the deflection angle with more accuracy than the distant ones .",
    "this method can be used for a large number of lenses as the passage of a quasar light ray through a galaxy .    in our tree code method",
    "we divide the lens plane into the cells and choose a same size pixel to surround the source at the source plane .",
    "the procedure starts with dividing the lens plane into four parts and in the source plane we choosing a pixel with the same size to surround the source object where the source is located at the center of the cell .",
    "we shoot enough number of light rays to each cell in the lens plane to cover the cell s area . using the lens equation ,",
    "if at least one of the rays collides to the source cell , we accept that cell for the next dividing step otherwise we remove this cell from the lens plane .",
    "we continue this dividing procedure up to the stage that we have enough pixels to cover the source object , having reasonable resolution . as much as smaller cells provides better resolution and less statistical fluctuations in the magnification calculation .",
    "since this pixelizing is time consumer , specially in the monte - carlo simulation , we stop the dividing procedure up to a desire resolution .",
    "for instance for the parent star , we cover the source with a @xmath51 gride .",
    "figure ( [ fig3 ] ) depicts the pixelizing procedure in this algorithm . in the final stage of pixelizing , the remained number of cells in the lens plane to that of cells in the source plane that covers the source star provides the magnification due to the gravitational lensing . also the remained pixels in the lens plane",
    "provides the shape of the images .",
    "we should note that due to the smaller size of the planet with respect to the source star , the magnification of the planet dose not suffer as much as the parent star from the finite - size effect .",
    "the result of planet caustic crossing will be like a flashing , let s call it `` planet flashing '' .",
    "while this flashing in term of magnification is much larger than that of magnification of the source star ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) , the intrinsic flux of the planet relative to the flux of the source star should be sufficient to be observed by a telescope .",
    "in the next section we will discuss this issue in details .",
    "in this section we study the details of light curve looking to the physical specifications of the source star and the companion planet as well as the binary lens .",
    "one of the main factors in the observability of the planet by this method is the ratio of the planet s flux as the signal to the flux of parent star as the background . using equation ( [ maga ] )",
    "we can describe the signal to the background in terms of the total and parent star magnifications : @xmath52 the overall flux receiving from a planet to the observer contains the radiation of the thermal energy due to the intrinsic temperature of the planet and the reflection of the parent star s light . assuming the thermal emission of the planet as a black body radiation @xcite , the temperature of the planet can be calculated by taking into account the absorption of the radiation receiving from the parent star and reradiating it through the boltzman law .",
    "hence the planet s temperature is given by : @xmath53^{1/4},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the radius and the temperature of the parent star , @xmath56 is the bond albedo and @xmath57 describes the fraction of reradiating energy which is absorbed by the planet .",
    "recent studies on the difference between the day and night luminosity of the planets through eclipsing show that @xmath57 can change between @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "@xmath60 represents a hot jupiter with low advection",
    "where in this case there is a big different between the temperature of the day and night on the planet and @xmath61 represents a planet with high redistribution of energy .",
    "the thermal flux of the planet is given by the planck s law as @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents the emitted power per unit area of emitting surface , per unit solid angle and per unit frequency .",
    "integrating over the frequency and over an half - sphere results in the stefan - bolttzmann law as follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the radius of the planet . on the other hand",
    "the flux of the planet due to the reflection of parent star s light is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the geometrical albedo , assuming the lambert s law , @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the phase of the planet and @xmath70 is a function of the planet phase indicates a fraction of the lighted area of planet in front of the observer .",
    "now the ratio of overall planet s flux which is composed by the thermal and reflation terms to the star s flux is given by : @xmath71,\\ ] ] where eliminating the planet s temperature from equation ( [ tpts ] ) , the flux radio obtains in the simpler form of @xmath72g(\\phi).\\ ] ] the important point in this equation is that it is independent of the temperature and the radius of the source star and it depends only on the chemical composition of the planet atmosphere which changes @xmath56 , the size and the distance of the planet from the parent star . during the gravitational lensing",
    "we multiply the corresponding magnifications of the planet and the parent star to the intrinsic flux of the source objects and obtain the overall receiving flux .    in practice",
    "we do not integrate over all the wavelengths , as the detector of the telescope may sensitive to an specific pass band . to find the optimal wavelength for the detection , we maximize the ratio of the intensity of the planet to that of the the parent star , i.e. @xmath73 . using equation ( [ sbeq ] ) and ( [ ref ] ) , assuming a constant reflection index for all the wavelengths ( i.e. @xmath74 ) , this ratio obtain as : @xmath75g(\\phi ) . \\label{ratio}\\ ] ]",
    "we should note that the reflection flux is mainly important in the optical bands , where the thermal flux dominates in the infra - red and sub - millimeter wavelengths .",
    "hot jupiters have small albedo of @xmath76 @xcite , so most of the radiation of the parent star is absorbed by the planet s atmosphere and is reradiated in the infra - red band .",
    "the result is a small share of luminosity of the planet in the reflected flux .",
    "the exception in the hot jupiters happens in the cases with the period of motion smaller than three days .",
    "this class of hot jupiters so - called very hot jupiters has a surface temperature larger than @xmath77 in which they reradiate considerable amount of thermal flux in the optical pass band .",
    "however , the peak of the spectrum is in infra - red band @xcite . out of this exception ,",
    "the most hot jupiters have a considerable flux in infra - red due to the thermal emission @xcite .",
    "we plot equation ( [ fr ] ) in figure ( [ fratio ] ) as an evidence that in the infra - red pass band , we have the most contrast between the flux of the planet and the parent star .",
    "here we compare the planet luminosity to the parent star luminosity as a function of the wavelength . in order to see the sensitivity of this fraction to the mass of the parent star , we plot this function for four masses of the parent star .",
    "choosing the parent star as a main sequence star , the radius of the star can be eliminate in favor of the mass , using @xmath78 where the corresponding parameters are normalized to that of sun s values . figure ( [ mass ] ) shows that m - dwarf stars are more favorable for the hot jupiter detection in the wavelengths longer than @xmath79 . however",
    ", we should note that for the m - dwarf star , the abundance of the hot neptunes is more than the hot jupiters .",
    "in this section we do a monte - carlo simulation to obtain quantitatively the sensitivity of the planet detection to the parameters of the binary lens and the planetary system . finally we provide the probability for detecting desired events .",
    "first of all we need to generate the parameters of the lens and the source according to the physical distribution of the parameters .",

    "since the parent star is assumed to belong to the main sequence , the radius of the star is taken from equation ( [ ms ] ) .",
    "on the other hand the luminosity of the parent star can be obtained from @xcite : @xmath90    for the parameters of the planet , the inclination angle @xmath30 of the planetary plane to the line of sight is taken uniformly in the range of @xmath91 $ ] .",

    "the radius not only is a function of the planet s mass , it also depends on the distance of the planet from the parent star @xcite .",
    "close - in planets are heated by the parent star and their atmosphere inflates .",
    "for the hot planets , in contrast to the conventional relation between the mass and the size , the small mass planets , inflate more than the massive ones .",

    "we showed that for longer pass - bands the detection efficiency is increased due to the more relative emissivity of planet compare to the parent star .",
    "finally we estimate the number of the hot jupiters that can be observed with this method towards the galactic bulge .",
    "with a ten years monitoring of @xmath139 stars towards the galactic bulge , we can detect in the order of @xmath140 hot jupiter with this method .",
    "this observation may be done by the next generation of the microlensing surveys towards the galactic bulge ."
