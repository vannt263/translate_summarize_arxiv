    "the karlsruhe tritium neutrino experiment katrin @xcite will be the first beta decay experiment attempting to measure the electron neutrino mass with sub - ev precision .",
    "presently the experiment is commissioned to start data - taking in 2013/14 and has a projected sensitivity of 0.2 ev ( 90% c.l . ) to the neutrino mass .",
    "katrin is the successor of the experiments in mainz @xcite and troitsk @xcite and will be using some of the same techniques as those . for the technical details of katrin",
    "see e.g. @xcite .    strictly speaking when measuring the electron neutrino mass with @xmath2-decay spectra ,",
    "what we get is the socalled kinematic neutrino mass .",
    "that is , the incoherent sum of neutrino mass eigenvalues weighted by the appropriate entries in the lepton mixing matrix : @xmath3    however , because the mass differences between the active neutrino mass states are known to be smaller than katrins sensitivity the experiment can effectively only see one mass state ( the mass squared differences are @xmath4 ev@xmath5 and @xmath6 ev@xmath5 , respectively @xcite ) .",
    "this mass state is sometimes called the electron neutrino mass , but in principle the tritium beta - spectrum could contain the signatures of more than one mass state or of couplings to other particles entirely . in order to be called truly model independent katrin s final data should be analyzed also for alternative scenarios - beyond the minimal extension of the standard model .    performing",
    "an analysis for non - standard couplings to the electron neutrino adds more parameter space to the @xmath1-function of the experiment .",
    "one should therefore consider how an extended analysis should be performed on the katrin output in order to get reliable results .",
    "we present here one approach which seems to give several advantages over the standard frequentist analysis . in section 2",
    "we describe our analysis methods before presenting results for a number of cases in section 3 .",
    "finally we give some concluding remarks in the last section .",
    "let us begin by summarising the procedures for production and analysis of katrin spectra as performed by a toy model monte carlo and analysis code for katrin - like experiments @xcite .",
    "this code has previously been used to forecast the experiment s sensitivity to the neutrino mass  @xcite .",
    "because katrin has an integrating spectrometer ( a consequence of the mac - e ( magnetic adiabatic collimation with electrostatic ) filter technique ) the beta - spectrum must be written as an integral over the electron energy : @xmath7    here @xmath8 is the retarding potential of the spectrometer , @xmath9 is the total number of tritium nuclei in the source , @xmath10 is the measurement time allotted for a given value of the retarding potential and @xmath11 is the experimental response function ( which in turn is a combination of the electron energy loss function of the tritium source and the transmission function of the spectrometer).@xmath12 is the theoretical beta spectrum rate folded with the electronic final state distribution of molecular tritium .    a retarding voltage - independent background rate of @xmath13 is now added to eq . ( [ eq : tid ] ) : @xmath14    this gives us the following theoretical expression for a katrin - like spectrum : @xmath15    individual spectra ( to resemble the real measurements )",
    "are built using initial parameters  and @xmath16 for the neutrino mass squared endpoint energy , respectively . to the theoretical expression",
    "is then added a random component from a gaussian distribution with @xmath17 and @xmath18 : @xmath19    when we want to fit our randomized beta - spectra we have to account for statistical fluctuations by allowing the overall amplitude @xmath20 of the signal as well as the background rate @xmath21 to vary against the theoretical amplitude @xmath22 and background rate @xmath13 . in addition , we allow the neutrino mass squared  as well as the endpoint energy @xmath23 to deviate from the initial parameters of the simulation  and @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath24    combining eq.s  ( [ eq : best2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : best3 ] ) we finally get katrin s @xmath1-function @xcite : @xmath25     beta - spectra[fig : fig1 ] for a katrin - like parameter set and an assumed value for the neutrino mass of @xmath26 measured with an optimized time distribution over the last 25  ev of the beta - spectrum , e.g. compare to @xcite.,width=597 ]    the analysis of the simulated data can be performed with minuit2 which is imbedded in the root - package .",
    "this procedure performs a minimization of the @xmath1-function using combinedminimizer .",
    "combinedminimizer in turn uses either an evaluation of the covariance matrix or a simplex method to find the best minimum of the @xmath1-function in the parameter space @xcite .",
    "one can now do a standard frequentist analysis to find the statistical uncertainty on e.g. the neutrino mass by producing a suitable amount of monte carlo spectra , performing the minimization for each of them and finally inspecting the resulting histograms .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] for 12860 spectra produced with @xmath27 0.0 ev .",
    "however as previously indicated the minimization approach has a number of drawbacks .",
    "for one thing it does not give any information on multiple minima , and it is not well suited for finding shallow minima .",
    "furthermore extracting detailed information on correlated parameters is pretty laborious .",
    "still the method works just fine for the four well - known free parameters used in a standard katrin analysis - see table  [ tab : org ] . but as one adds more parameters the minimization procedure often becomes problematic and rather slow .      as an alternative approach we have considered markov chain monte carlo and bayesian inference techniques as in the publicly available cosmomc analysis package for cosmology .",
    "typical cosmological models contain @xmath28 8 - 12 parameters and cosmomc is well suited for relatively fast analysis of such multiparameter spaces @xcite .",
    "the programme is built for analysis of large cosmological datasets such as cmb data from wmap and supernova surveys but can in principle analyse whatever dataset the user provides - the cosmology can be turned off if it is irrelevant .",
    "cosmomc uses bayesian statistics for the analysis .",
    "when doing socalled bayesian parameter inference one is interested in knowing the posterior probability , @xmath29 - the probability of the * parameters * , @xmath30 , given the data @xmath31 and the model @xmath32 .",
    "the inverse question is for the probability of the * data * , d , given the parameters and the model , @xmath33 - this is simply the likelihood function . with these two probabilities and the well - known bayes theorem ,",
    "@xmath34    one can write an expression for the posterior probability : @xmath35    here @xmath36 is the likelihood - which can be easily derived from the @xmath1-function is connected to the @xmath1-function as in the following way : @xmath37 . ] .",
    "the posterior probability is thus proportional to the likelihood .",
    "meanwhile @xmath38 is the socalled prior probability sometimes referred to as the subjective input - it is what we believe we know from theory before even taking the data into account .",
    "correspondingly this probability has no dependence on the data .",
    "note that we have been using flat priors on all input parameters in this paper .",
    "finally @xmath39 , the evidence , is in effect only a parameter - independent normalization constant@xcite",
    ".    when we want to know best - fit values and confidence levels of specific parameters we can then simply integrate over all the remaining ( nuisance ) parameters .",
    "this is called marginalization and the output is called the marginalized probability for the parameter of interest .",
    "in addition to this rather convenient production of parameter probability distributions , from the bayesian inference approach , cosmomc gives us another great advantage by using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) to probe the parameter space .",
    "this will provide a very thorough and easy to inspect mapping of the parameter space of interest .",
    "the purpose of the mcmc is to probe the whole parameter space in a randomized manner . to achieve this one implements the metropolis hastings algorithm @xcite consisting of three main steps :    firstly an initial point ,",
    "@xmath40 is chosen .",
    "secondly a step is proposed in some random direction , after which the new point is evaluated : @xmath41 . here @xmath42 means the iterative point , and @xmath43 is the proposed addition taken from some proposal density .",
    "finally the procedure decides whether or not to take the step .",
    "the point @xmath44 is accepted if the posterior probability is improved .",
    "that is if @xmath45 if the expression above is @xmath46 the step is accepted with some probability @xmath47 ( rejected with probability @xmath48 ) . in this manner",
    "we generate a set of points @xmath49 , also called a markov chain . for the number of points , @xmath50 ,",
    "going to infinity we thus have a representation of the posterior probability",
    ".    the decision procedure of the metropolis hastings algorithm allows the chain to wander away from any local minima and thus potentially discover other minima ( to a degree determined by the value of r , with temperature , @xmath51 . ] . on the other hand it also guarantees",
    "that the parameter space near the minima is very well probed .",
    "furthermore one can perform the analysis on a combination of multiple chains - all started at random positions - and get an even better picture of the behavior of the different parameters in the allowed intervals .",
    "to get rid of un - physical effects from the random starting points one normally allows for a burn - in ",
    "i.e. the first part of the markov chain is removed . in our case",
    "the burn - in is 50% of the sample size .    before running the programme one must carefully choose stepsizes and parameter ranges .",
    "several settings in both the cosmomc programme as such and in the parameter files can be tweaked to fit ones purpose .",
    "unfortunately it is in principle not possible to determine in any absolute terms whether or not a specific chain has converged @xcite , but various convergence diagnostics have been developed .",
    "for instance when analyzing multiple chains a convergence parameter , @xmath52 , defined as the variance of the chain means divided by the mean of the chain variances , can be evaluated .",
    "if @xmath53 is less than some chosen small number ( in our case 0.03 ) this information is interpreted as good convergence .",
    "when cosmomc has generated the chains we need , the data analysis is performed giving us best - fit values and standard deviations for all the parameters .",
    "additionally cosmomc produces a number of useful matlab - files which can be used to produce @xmath54 and @xmath55 plots of the marginalized distributions .",
    "inspecting this graphical output allows us to determine if the chains have really converged , whether there are multiple minima and perhaps most importantly it shows parameter correlations right away .",
    "if we go through all of this for say a single monte carlo generated beta spectrum we get all the nice advantages mentioned above .",
    "but the analysis of that one spectrum would take many hours as compared to minutes or seconds with the minuit2 procedure and we would mostly just have achieved a much slower evaluation of the best fit values for that particular spectrum .",
    "however if we in stead use the theoretical beta - spectrum ( which should represent the average of infinitely many measurements or monte carlo realizations ) as our input data - but with monte carlo generated errorbars - our best fit values and standard deviations from cosmomc should correspond to the results of the frequentist approach of building histograms for a very large ( going to infinity ) number of measurements .    to recap",
    "we implemented our @xmath1-function for katrin - like experiments in cosmomc and simply turned off cosmology .",
    "as data - set we have used the theoretical spectra - for any given model - with the monte carlo generated errorbars of the original code .",
    "the results will be discussed in the following section .",
    "as a first test of our methods we have attempted to reproduce the katrin sensitivity .",
    "we thus generated a tritium beta - spectrum using as input so far only four parameters : the electron neutrino mass squared , the endpoint of the beta - spectrum @xmath16 ] , the background count rate @xmath13 and the signal count rate near the beta - spectrum endpoint , @xmath22 - see eq .",
    "( [ eq : best1 ] ) .    the input signal count rate can be calculated as a combination of the column density of the source and the magnetic fields and cross sections of the spectrometer and source . in our case the count rate near the endpoint @xmath23 is included in the analysis code via an amplitude factor @xmath22 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : best3 ] ) . the exact definition and full calculation of this factor @xmath22",
    "is included in appendix a of reference @xcite .",
    "given katrin s experimental settings the amplitude has the value @xmath57  hz .",
    "we would like to remark , that the value of the endpoint energy @xmath23 needs to be treated as a free parameter to produce realistic fits with respect to fitting of .",
    "up to now the @xmath58he - @xmath58h mass difference is known from precision penning trap experiments with 1.2  ev precision @xcite , but already the fits of the experiments at mainz @xcite and troitsk @xcite would have needed a much more precise input value to justify keeping @xmath23 fixed in the fit .",
    ".katrin standard analysis parameters .",

    "this analysis includes the righthanded coupling strength as a free parameter .",
    "the bias on the mass is as large as 80% while the values of @xmath60 is up to five times as large as for the standard case ( barring the parameter range below katrins sensitivity where the uncertainty on the mass parameter migrates into the b - dimension in the mcmc ) .",

    "we see that we get the output values wrong by more than a factor 10 !",
    "this is exacerbated at mass values just above the katrins sensitivity once again demonstrating how the uncertainty on these two ill - determined parameters is redistributed in the parameter space of the markov chain .",

    "[ fig : b_r],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the results shows us firstly that the output mass values fluctuate rather wildly - and in some cases deviate my as much as @xmath64 80 % from the input values as shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : m_r ] . and secondly the statistical uncertainty is up to 5 times larger than in the standard case except in regions where @xmath65 <",
    "0.2 ev as expected from the discussion above . turning to at the output values of the righthanded coupling strength in figure [ fig : b_r ] we get appallingly bad results especially in the @xmath65 = 0.2 ev -region .",
    "from the left hand picture of figure [ fig : b_r ] one might get the impression that the output value of b is returned rather nicely for the larger masses .",
    "however as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : b_r ] the relative error is still up to @xmath64 60% in some regions . in conclusion",
    "we see from these numerical artifacts that it is extremely difficult to get a good determination of _ both _ the mass and the coupling strength . at least when using fairly large parameter intervals .",
    "given stronger limits the situation would no doubt change . but judging from our cosmomc contours the values in some cases will be pressed to the largest allowed parameter values even when the intervals are as broad as here . in other words - tighter parameter values in this case",
    "merely amounts to a manual setting of the allowed size of the statistical uncertainties .",
    "next we perform the analysis on the same spectra without including the righthanded coupling strength to get an idea of the bias imposed on the neutrino mass in the presence of unaccounted - for righthanded currents .",
    "we present our results in figure [ fig : nor ]     but here the analysis has been performed ( on the same spectra ) without the inclusion of the righthanded coupling strength .",
    "clearly the errors on @xmath65 are much better and for realistic @xmath66-values certainly within acceptable @xmath67-ranges .",
    "however we note that @xmath68 is @xmath69 better in the high - b , high - m corners of the right - side plot .",
    "this coincides with a turnover of the bias on the mass in the left - side plot .",
    "figure [ fig : eor ] shows that this behavior takes place because the @xmath70 parameter is being pushed to the maximally allowed values , which should be avoided .",
    "that is the uncertainty on the mass due to the presence of @xmath66 is migrating into the third correlated parameter - the endpoint of the tritium beta spectrum .",

    "[ fig : nor],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    as it turns out we get much better results when we remove the @xmath66-dimension from our cosmomc setup - this time the bias on the mass is no larger than around 12 % .",
    "we notice however that the statistical error drops steeply for high masses and coupling strengths .",
    "inspecting the original cosmomc likelihood contours we see that this is because @xmath70 has been pushed to the edge of the input interval as shown in figure [ fig : eor ] .",
    "this also explains why the bias flips in the same parameter - range instead of becoming monotonically larger for maximal coupling strengths .",
    "the propagation of the uncertainty on @xmath66 into the @xmath70-dimension is straightforward from the already discussed correlations between the @xmath71 and @xmath70 - parameters .",
    "hopefully the upcoming much more precise @xmath58h@xmath58he mass measurements @xcite will be helpful in resolving this issue for the katrin experiment .     vs. @xmath72 for the mass range @xmath73 ev to @xmath74 ev ( again going from the upper left corner to the lower right corner ) when the analysis is performed without the inclusion of @xmath66 .",
    "the figure on the left used spectra that was produced with @xmath75 while the figure on the right is for @xmath76 .",
    "the expected output for @xmath70 is zero , but it is clear to see that in this case the @xmath77 -correlation pushes the uncertainty induced in the mass parameter by the physical presence of @xmath66 into the @xmath70 -parameter instead .",

    "fig : eor],title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    in conclusion the bias induced on the neutrino mass is now within acceptable bounds and agree well with the results found by bonn _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "finally it should be noted that an experiment such as katrin can clearly not be used to put bounds on the size of the righthanded coupling strength at this point .",
    "a precise knowledge of the neutrino mass and the tritium beta - spectrum endpoint @xmath23 would be have to be presupposed before measurements of the tritium beta spectrum could be used to determine @xmath66 .",
    "our attempt at an analysis of simulated katrin data with various additional parameters has shown the following : for the standard case of analysis with regard to one neutrino mass , the mcmc approach is certainly well suited and gives robust results .",
    "the method is very practical when performing analysis for non - standard cases because the cosmomc output lets us inspect the behavior of the parameters and their relation to one another in a straightforward manner .",
    "we have used the method to build a sensitivty - plot for a katrin - like experiment , clearly demonstrating the dominating dependence of the sensitivity on the signal countrate .",
    "further we have learned that for a suitable mass - squared difference an experiment such as katrin should be able to detect the existence of other neutrino mass states . and",
    "finally we have re - evaluated the influence of couplings to righthanded currents in the tritium beta decay and found that ignoring this would maximally induce an error on the neutrino mass of order 10% .",
    "in conclusion we find that our bayesian approach to the analysis of the katrin experiment is certainly competitive to a frequentist approach and that it has several advantages over it when using an already well - developed framework such as cosmomc .",
