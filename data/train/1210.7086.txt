    "the extinction and photoluminescence ( pl ) measurements presented in the main text were all performed with computer - controlled rotation stages .",

    "for the extinction , we measured the transmittance through the array of a collimated ( angular spread @xmath70 ) and linearly polarized light beam from a halogen lamp .",
    "the spot size was @xmath71 m . we define the extinction as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the zeroth - order transmittance .",
    "reflectance measurements are not included , but can be found for similar nanoparticle arrays in ref .  @xcite . for the pl measurements , the pump was an optical parametric oscillator with peak energy @xmath37 ev , @xmath38 fs pulses , and @xmath39 mhz repetition rate .",
    "the pump beam was lightly focused ( spot size of @xmath72 m ) and impinged with @xmath73 rad/@xmath74 m .",
    "the emitted light was collected by a fiber - coupled spectrometer preceded by a polarization analyzer .",
    "the pump power was varied with a neutral density filter , and measured in front of the sample .",
    "the highest power used yielded a fraction of excited r6 g molecules below @xmath75 , as discussed ahead . both extinction and pl measurements",
    "are shown for s - polarized light ( y - axis , parallel to the short axis of the nanorods ) with in - plane momentum @xmath76 ( parallel to the long axis of the nanorods ) .",
    "all experiments were performed at room temperature ( @xmath10 k ) .",
    "an important experimental parameter in the pl measurements is the time duration of the pump pulse .",
    "the pulse duration was roughly a factor of 2 higher than the expected vibrational relaxation time scale of the organic molecules , which poses a challenge for an equilibrium state to be established .",
    "the unlikelihood of an equilibrium state with a true temperature in the usual sense is already manifest in the high effective temperatures reported in figs .",
    "4(k ) and 4(l ) in the main text .",
    "the fact that these effective temperatures are much higher than the lattice temperature indicates that while plasmon - exciton - polaritons may achieve local self - equilibrium amongst themselves through inelastic scattering , they remain out of equilibrium with their surroundings .",
    "however , the relatively short pulse duration was chosen for a reason : a shorter pulse yields higher peak powers compared to continuous - wave or long - pulse lasers with equal average power .",
    "the high peak power leads to a high density of excitations , while the removal of the pump power shortly after ( at the end of the pulse ) assists in heat dissipation .",
    "thus , greater `` instantaneous '' densities  which are essential for the results in this letter  can be created before reaching the damage threshold of the molecules .",
    "in fact , this damage threshold ( an irreversible photobleaching ) prevented us from using higher pump powers in the pl experiments .",
    "as the system dynamics depend sensitively on the excitation source , we expect future experiments using different sources to reveal novel phenomena , and to further clarify the influence of the pulse duration on the thermalization dynamics .",

    ", we fit the measurements with the sum of two lorentzians and the background r6 g emission . as described in detail in the following section , the two peaks observed in the spectra correspond to the extrema of a continuous distribution of emission lines with different slr - exciton coupling strength .",

    ", it follows the decay of the ( uncoupled ) r6 g molecules that are pumped ( as the pep lifetime of @xmath57fs is a lot shorter than the picosecond lifetime of the excitations ) . assuming a gaussian beam , this gives @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the distance from the beam center in the plane , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the spot size and excitation lifetime .",
    "the emission from each point follows a lorentzian energy distribution centered around the ( local ) pep energy .",
    "the emission intensity is proportional to @xmath125 , where the sublinear square - root term is likely due to bimolecular quenching  @xcite , and is also observed in the experimental results for the total output power as a function of the pump power ( ) .",

    "the total emission spectrum is then given by an integral of over space and time : @xmath128 where we have exploited the radial symmetry of the integrand .",
    "note that the final result does not depend on @xmath123 or @xmath124 apart from a global scaling . in the following",
    ", we do not fix the proportionality factor between input power and @xmath129 , but instead set @xmath120 and @xmath117 in units where @xmath129 is given in w/@xmath43 , and set @xmath130 to the total input power . the parameter values used for fig .",

    "<S> the intermediate regions form a broad background that is not resolved as an isolated peak . accordingly , for increased pumping the lower pep emission saturates , while the new band blue - shifts towards the bare slr state and grows in intensity . </S>",

    "<S> we now study the dispersion of the observed bands through their angle - dependent emission intensity , shown in figures  [ fig4](a)-(h ) for several pump powers . </S>",

    "<S> it is also flatter , corresponding to a slightly higher effective mass of @xmath55 kg ( extracted from the curvature of the band at @xmath25 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to a well - known difference between extinction and emission spectra : extinction stems from the interference between direct and scattered radiation , while emission does not contain a direct part . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a shift of the peak emission energy  @xcite , which can also affect the extracted effective mass if it is angle - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> for high pumping , the peak of the emission is slightly red - shifted from the slr peak in extinction . according to our model , </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the coupling is not fully saturated  </S>",

    "<S> next , we discuss the thermalization behavior . </S>",
    "<S> condensation as a thermodynamic phase transition requires the system to approach thermal equilibrium , which constrains the ratio of thermalization to decay time . for inorganic exciton - polaritons , both of these times are @xmath56ps , and consequently both equilibrium and non - equlibrium condensation have been observed  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> vibrational relaxation of r6 g , and thus pep - phonon scattering , occurs on a scale of @xmath58fs  @xcite , while pep - pep scattering rates are currently unknown . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , equilibrium dynamics seem unlikely in our case . as we show next , we nevertheless observe thermalization and cooling for increased pumping , possibly due to more efficient pep - pep scattering at high density .    figures  [ fig4](a)-(d ) display a greater emission from the strongly coupled band at low pumping , while figs .  </S>",

    "<S> the occupation is extracted from the emission intensity @xmath60 along the corresponding band , integrated over a fixed bandwidth of @xmath61 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account that peps are composite quasi - particles and only their photonic component leaks out of the open system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as in exciton - polariton systems  @xcite , we correct for the slr fraction @xmath62 , giving @xmath63 . here </S>",

    "<S> this is possibly due to angle - dependent variations in collection efficiency and intensity fluctuations during the measurement time .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective temperature of the strongly coupled peps displays an initial decrease , but remains warmer than the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this observation , which is reminiscent of early works on exciton - polariton condensates  @xcite , indicates that the system approaches but does not fully reach thermal equilibrium with the heat bath ( the molecule phonons ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we observe that for increased pumping the ground state ( @xmath68 ) occupation increases slightly above the maxwell - boltzmann fit . </S>",
    "<S> this could be an indication that the bosonic statistics of the peps are becoming relevant , implying that condensation is being approached , although not reached . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the ground state occupation remains much lower than in exciton - polariton condensates  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the power increases and saturation is approached , @xmath65 increases again , although the experimental uncertainty from the fits also increases . </S>",
    "<S> this increased uncertainty implies a stronger deviation of the @xmath59 from a thermal distribution near the strong - to - weak coupling transition . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , while cooling of peps is observed , saturation of the slr - exciton coupling sets in before condensation is reached , and the new band with weaker coupling emerges and blue - shifts towards the bare slr state . the effective temperatures in this new band [ ( l ) ] are higher than in the pep band . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , @xmath65 decreases monotonically as pumping increases . </S>",
    "<S> this cooling implies that condensation of bare slrs could be within reach , analogous to the condensation of cavity photons observed by klaers _ </S>",
    "<S> et  al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . currently , further pumping was not possible because the molecules bleached </S>",
    "<S> . a different pump source or dye could circumvent this limitation , enabling higher excitation densities . </S>",
    "<S> we note that slr lasing has recently been demonstrated by zhou and co - workers  @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we presented experimental indications of thermalization and cooling of quasi - particles in an array of ag nanoparticles covered by organic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this array supports surface lattice resonances , which form plasmon - exciton - polaritons ( peps ) through strong coupling to molecular excitons . in view of the low pep mass , which is furthermore tunable via the surface lattice resonance dispersion , </S>",
    "<S> we believe that plasmonics holds great promise for solid - state studies of macroscopic quantum many - body physics at and above room - temperature . </S>",
    "<S> while the short lifetimes of plasmons make thermodynamic equilibrium challenging , we envisage these results to open a new avenue for studying non - equilibrium quantum dynamics .    </S>",
