    "the possibility of having a wigner crystallization of large polarons in the cuprates was first proposed in 1989 by remova and shapiro @xcite .",
    "this problem was independently studied by us on purely theoretical grounds @xcite in the framework of the frhlich model , regardless of the particular structure of the cuprates . up to now , the many - polaron problem was only studied in the high density ( metallic ) limit @xcite .",
    "recently , it was found @xcite that a cdw instability can occur for sufficiently low densities .",
    "our approach relies on the opposite low density limit , which we believe to be relevant for doped ionic dielectrics .",
    "let us consider a continuous polar medium characterized by three parameters : the static dielectric constant @xmath1 , the high frequency dielectric constant @xmath2 , and the longitudinal optical phonon frequency @xmath3 .",
    "reasonable estimates in the cuprates ( e.g. in la@xmath4cuo@xmath5 @xcite ) give @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "importantly , the static dielectric constant is almost isotropic in all directions of space @xcite .",
    "this experimental fact means that the coulomb forces and the phonons carrying the polarization field act in the same way in all directions .",
    "on doping such a polar material , the optical phonons dress and screen the doping charges ( this is the well - known polaron effect ) . the strength of the electron - phonon coupling is given by the dimensionless constant @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the band mass .",
    "due to their layered structure , the carrier masses in the cuprates are highly anisotropic ( in particular , no coherent motion takes place along the _ _",
    "c-__axis ) . in our model , this situation can be qualitatively described by introducing a second parameter @xmath12 , where @xmath11 now refers to the cu - o planes only .",
    "one usually estimates @xmath13 ( @xmath14 being the bare electron mass ) , so that the e - ph coupling in the _",
    "_ ab-__planes is roughly @xmath15 .",
    "as is well established , two polarons repel at distance @xmath16 as @xmath17 , provided that the dielectric constants satisfy @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "therefore , at low density and neglecting the details of chemical doping , _ the crystallized state is necessarily the ground - state of the many - polaron problem_. this basic result has several important consequences :",
    "\\(i ) at zero temperature , as the density increases , there is a _ competition _ between the quantum melting of the pwc towards a degenerate polaron liquid , and the dissociation ( ionization ) of the polarons themselves .",
    "\\(ii ) at large values of the e - ph coupling @xmath19 , the melting towards a polaron liquid is not possible , and it is _ the polaron dissociation that drives the transition _",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) taking into account the dipolar interactions between polarons , it can be shown that the pwc has an intrinsic _ phonon instability _ above a given critical density @xmath20 , which is closely related to the polaron dissociation .",
    "\\(iv ) such an instability has an optical signature : _ the peak due to the existence of polarons in the optical conductivity , which is centered at a definite frequency at very low density , is progressively shifted towards lower values as the transition is approached , and eventually saturates at @xmath3 _ @xcite .",
    "this softening has been experimentally observed in nd@xmath21ce@xmath22cuo@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "\\(v ) the longitudinal dielectric constant @xmath24 of the pwc is negative on a large region of @xmath25 @xcite . in particular , @xmath26 .",
    "as already noted in @xcite , the repulsive coulomb interactions between free charges liberated above the critical doping would be _ overscreened _ by the high frequency vibrations of the localized pwc .",
    "let us focus on the quantum melting ( at zero temperature ) of the pwc .",
    "when the e - ph coupling vanishes , we are left with an ordinary wc of electrons . as the density increases , the quantum fluctuations of the localized particles increase and when they reach a certain magnitude , the crystal melts towards a liquid state of electrons .",
    "the effect of the host lattice is negligible in that case . in the opposite limit @xmath27",
    ", the e - ph coupling @xmath19 becomes infinite .",
    "each electron in this limit is self - trapped in a polarization potential well which is _ frozen_. as it is well - known , the latter has a _ coulombic _ nature and behaves as @xmath28 at large distance .",
    "since the polarization can not move , the polarons , i.e. the electron _ plus _ the polarization , can not go towards a liquid state .",
    "the imt is thus driven by the dissocation of the polarons and the screening of the polarization potentials by the liberated electrons .",
    "we are in a situation which closely resembles the usual mott transition . for finite values of @xmath3",
    ", we have applied the lindemann criterion to the pwc s melting , as was already done for the usual wc by nozieres _",
    "the main difference here is that one must take into account the _ composite nature of the polarons_. to be able to delocalize the polarons towards a liquid state , the quantum fluctuations for each polaron moving as a whole , i.e. the motion of each electron together with its surrounding polarization , must become large in comparison with @xmath29 . on the contrary , if the relative fluctuations of the electron with respect to the polarization become large , the polarons break apart ( dissociation ) .",
    "the feynman treatment for the polaron @xcite , which relies on path integral calculations , yields a natural way to evaluate such quantities : since the polarization field in feynman s approach is replaced by a rigid particle with coordinate @xmath30 and mass @xmath31 , one easily calculates both the quantum fluctuations of the center of mass @xmath32 and of the relative coordinate @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the electron coordinate ) .",
    "this gives two different lindemann criteria , which correspond to two competing melting scenarios : ( i ) @xmath35 for the melting towards a liquid state of polarons ; ( ii ) @xmath36 for the polaron dissociation .",
    "the frequencies of the two degrees of freedom @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively @xmath39 and @xmath40 , were calculated in ref.@xcite , together with the ratios ( i ) and ( ii ) for different @xmath19 . from the basic observation that a polaron is a bound state of an electron plus a phonon cloud , it was pointed out that the frequency of vibration of the polaron as a whole is physically limited by the phonon frequency ( @xmath41 ) . in other words , at strong electron - phonon coupling ( or equivalently at small @xmath3 ) , the lattice polarization _ can not dynamically follow _ the increase in kinetic energy induced by the doping , and the quantum fluctuations",
    "are transferred to the _ internal _ degree of freedom , breaking the polaron apart .",
    "for that reason , the polarons are expected to _ dissociate _ at the transition for sufficiently high @xmath19 ( @xmath42 ) , rather than _ melting _ to a polaron liquid .",
    "the calculated critical density for @xmath0 is @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "importantly , we have also calculated the same quantities for an anisotropic pwc ( @xmath45 ) , as described in the introduction . in that case",
    "the critical coupling for polaron dissociation is @xmath46 , and the critical density is higher than in the isotropic case : @xmath47 for @xmath44 .",
    "the rather moderate values of @xmath48 found in the anisotropic case suggest that polaron dissociation should be taken into account in the description of the imt in the cuprates .",
    "the spectrum of the low - lying excitations ( phonons ) of the pwc can also be calculated according to the feynman model . basically , one can write down an effective lagrangian for the pwc @xcite , where each polaron is replaced by a two - particle unit @xmath49 localized on a bravais lattice site @xmath50 .",
    "the lagrangian contains two kinds of interactions : ( i ) local @xmath51 terms ( polaron effect , plus the average local field of the remaining electrons ) ; ( ii ) long - range dipolar interactions , both instantaneous @xmath52 and retarded @xmath53 , which are responsible for the dispersion in the vibrational spectrum .",
    "according to this semi - classical treatment , the phonon spectrum of the pwc is given by : @xmath54 ^ 2 - 4 \\omega_{lo}^2 \\omega^2_w({\\bf k } , \\lambda ) / \\varepsilon_s } \\right\\rbrace \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 are the eigenfrequencies of the usual wc @xcite , labeled by the index @xmath56 ( two transverse acoustical branches and one longitudinal optical ) .",
    "these satisfy the kohn sum rule : @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the usual electron plasma frequency , @xmath59 being the doping density ) .",
    "the pwc has thus @xmath60 branches : three with the ` + ' sign in ( [ frequency ] ) , that we call @xmath61 , all optical and which correspond to the vibrations of the ` internal ' degrees of freedom ( the relative motion of the polarization with respect to the electrons ) ; three branches with the - sign , that we call @xmath62 , corresponding to the vibrations of the polarons as a whole ( electrons + polarization oscillating in phase ) .",
    "two of these branches are transverse acoustical , as in the case of the ordinary wc .",
    "the general aspect of the spectrum is sketched on fig.1 . in eq .",
    "( [ frequency ] ) , we have introduced an important quantity : @xmath63 which corresponds to the transverse collective modes of the ` internal ' degree of freedom at @xmath64 .",
    "its evolution as a function of the density is sketched on fig.2 .",
    "we have proved elsewhere @xcite that such excitations can only be stable provided that @xmath65 . beyond this limit , i.e. at densities higher than a certain @xmath20 ,",
    "the pwc is unstable with respect to polaron dissociation .",
    "since @xmath66 is the frequency of a transverse mode at @xmath64 , it corresponds to a peak the _ polaron peak _  in the optical conductivity . as the density increases",
    ", @xmath66 decreases until @xmath20 is reached , and eventually saturates at @xmath67 .",
    "this behaviour has indeed been observed in nd@xmath21ce@xmath22cuo@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the ( longitudinal ) dielectric constant @xmath68 can also be calculated .",
    "it is given by : @xmath69      [ \\omega_{+}^2({\\bf k } , \\lambda ) -\\omega^2 ] } \\right ]   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 , is the dielectric constant of the medium , with as usual @xmath71 . from eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) , it is easy to extract the static dielectric constant , which is just proportional to the static dielectric constant of the usual wc calculated by bagchi @xcite : @xmath72.\\ ] ] owing to the kohn sum rule , one easily shows that @xmath73 for any @xmath74 . as it was discussed quite generally by dolgov _",
    "@xcite , this does not necessarily imply an instability : it simply means that the coulomb repulsion between two test charges in such a system is overscreened by the vibrations of the wc .",
    "when one approaches the phonon instability , the negativity of the dielectric constant is extended on a large region of @xmath25 . from this result",
    ", we conjecture that beyond the imt , the moving liberated charges can condense in a superconducting state owing to the overscreening of their coulomb repulsion by the remaining localized pwc .",
    "this can work only up to a second critical density @xmath75 at which the localized polarons themselves are completely screened and destroyed . in some sense",
    ", we have some kind of staggered mott - like transition which begins at @xmath20 and ends at @xmath75 . for @xmath76 the doping charges form polarons which crystallize .",
    "they all disappear for @xmath77 , while for @xmath78 , there could be a separation between localized polarons and condensed charges , the glue being the long - range coulomb force mediated by the vibrations of the pwc",
