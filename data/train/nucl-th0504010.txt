    "a system  @xmath2 with energy @xmath3 and degeneracy @xmath4 while seemingly having a partition function of the form @xmath5 for all temperatures @xmath6 in fact admits only temperature @xmath7 and it imparts that temperature to system coupled to it .    the partition function of eq .",
    "( [ therm - part ] ) implies that an external thermostat @xmath8 which , by definition has @xmath9 , can impart its temperature @xmath10 to the system @xmath2 .",

    "this preamble is motivated by the fact that the empirical hadronic mass spectra ( hagedorn spectra @xcite ) , the statistical bootstrap model @xcite and the mit bag model @xcite have a degeneracy whose leading term is of the form of eq .",
    "( [ therm - deg ] ) .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to explore in a pedagogical manner the implications of such a spectrum , making only passing references to the more complex physical situations occurring in particle - particle and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "hagedorn noted that the hadronic mass spectrum ( level density ) has the asymptotic ( @xmath14 ) form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass of the hadron in question and @xmath1 is the temperature associated with the mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the question of the mass range over which ( [ hagedorn ] ) is valid is still under discussion @xcite .",
    "the m.i.t .",
    "bag model @xcite of partonic matter reproduces this behavior via a constant pressure @xmath8 of a `` bag '' of partonic matter @xcite . the pressure @xmath17 inside a bag at equilibrium without additional conserved quantities is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the bag constant forces a constant temperature @xmath20 on the bag .",
    "similarly , the enthalpy density @xmath21 of the bag @xmath22 is constant . here",
    "@xmath23 is the enthalpy and @xmath24 is the volume of the bag .",
    "thus , an injection of an arbitrary amount of energy leads to an isothermal , isobaric expansion of the bag and the bag entropy @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath23 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the change in heat of the bag .",
    "the bag s spectrum ( level density ) is then @xmath28 given by eq .",
    "( [ hagedorn ] ) with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we show here that a system @xmath0 possessing a hagedorn - like spectrum , characterized by an entropy of the form ( [ bag - eq ] ) , not only has a unique microcanonical temperature @xmath31 but also imparts this same temperature to any other system to which @xmath0 is coupled . in the language of standard thermodynamics : @xmath0 is a perfect thermostat .",
    "the property of a perfect thermostat is well known .",
    "for instance , it is indifferent to the transfer of any portion of its energy to any parcel within itself , no matter how small . in other words , it is at the limit of phase stability and its internal fluctuations of the energy density are maximal .",
    "in order to demonstrate the thermostatic behavior of a hagedorn system , let us begin by coupling @xmath0 to a one dimensional harmonic oscillator and use a microcanonical treatment .",
    "the unnormalized probability @xmath32 for finding excitation energy @xmath33 in the harmonic oscillator out of the system s total energy @xmath3 is @xmath34 recall that for a one dimensional harmonic oscillator @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "the energy spectrum of the oscillator is canonical up to the upper limit @xmath36 with an inverse slope ( temperature ) of @xmath1 independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the mean value of the energy of the oscillator is given by @xmath37 .",
    "\\label{ave - ho - e}\\ ] ] thus in the limit that @xmath38 : @xmath39 , i.e. no temperature other that @xmath1 is admitted .",
    "for a more physically relevant example , let us consider a vapor of @xmath40 non - interacting particles of mass @xmath16 coupled to @xmath0 .",
    "the microcanonical level density of the vapor with kinetic energy @xmath33 is @xmath41 where @xmath24 is is the volume .",
    "the microcanonical partition of the total system is @xmath42 just as with the harmonic oscillator , the distribution of the vapor is exactly canonical up to @xmath43 , if the particles are independently present , or @xmath44 , if the particles are generated by @xmath0 . in either case , the temperature of the vapor is always @xmath1 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath33 gives the most probable kinetic energy per particle as @xmath46 provided that @xmath47 .",
    "( for @xmath48 , the most probable value of the kinetic energy per particle is @xmath49 ; for @xmath50 , @xmath51 .  )  again @xmath1 is the sole temperature characterizing the distribution up to the microcanonical cut - off , which may be above or below the maximum of the distribution since the form of @xmath45 is independent of  @xmath3 .",

    "( [ max-01 ] ) was used for @xmath33 .",
    "thus the most probable particle density of the vapor is independent of @xmath24 : @xmath54 equation  ( [ numberpp ] ) demonstrates that not only is @xmath0 a perfect thermostat but also a perfect particle reservoir .",
    "particles of different mass @xmath16 will be in chemical equilibrium with each other . at equilibrium",
    ", particles are emitted from @xmath0 and form a saturated vapor at coexistence with @xmath0 at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "this describes a first order phase transition ( hadronic to partonic ) .",
    "coexistence occurs at a single temperature fixed by the bag pressure .",
    "these results explain the common value of : the hadronization temperatures obtained within the statistical hadronization model @xcite ; the inverse slopes of the transverse mass spectra of hadrons observed in high energy elementary particle collisions @xcite ; and the transition temperature from lattice qcd calculations for low baryonic density @xcite . for further discussion see @xcite .",
    "let us assume that @xmath0 is a bag thick enough to absorb any given particle of the vapor striking it .",
    "then , detailed balance requires that on average @xmath0 radiates back the same particle . under these conditions particles",
    "can be considered to be effectively emitted from the surface of @xmath0 .",
    "thus the relevant fluxes do not depend in any way upon the inner structure of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the results given in equations ( [ max-01 ] ) and ( [ numberpp ] ) show that the saturated vapor concentration depends only upon @xmath16 and @xmath1 as long as @xmath0 is present . a decrease in the volume @xmath24 does not increase the vapor concentration , but induces a condensation of the corresponding amount of energy out of the vapor and into @xmath0 .",
    "an increase in @xmath24 keeps the vapor concentration constant via evaporation of the corresponding amount of energy out of @xmath0 and into the vapor .",
    "this is reminiscent of liquid - vapor equilibrium at fixed temperature , except that here coexistence occurs at a single temperature @xmath1 , rather than over a range of temperatures as in ordinary fluids .",
    "the bag wall is janus faced : one side faces the partonic world , and , aside from conserved charges , radiates a partonic black body radiation responsible for balancing the bag pressure ; the other side faces the hadronic world and radiates a hadronic black body radiation , mostly pions .",
    "both sides of the bag wall are at the temperature @xmath1 .",
    "it is tempting to attribute most , if not all , of the hadronic and partonic properties to the wall itself , possibly even the capability to enforce conservation laws globally ( quantum number conductivity ) . despite the fact that this wall is an insurmountable horizon with hadronic measurements such as bag size and total radiance we can infer some properties of the partonic world , e.g. the number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we can estimate an upper limit for the emission time using the outward energy flux of particles radiated from the bag . at equilibrium",
    "the in - going and out - going fluxes must be the same , thus the outward flux of particles in the nonrelativistic approximation using eq .  ( [ numberpp ] )",
    "is @xmath55 using the technique developed in @xcite , one finds the energy flux @xmath56 and momentum flux @xmath57 as @xmath58 the pressure @xmath57 exerted on the bag by its radiation can be compared to the intrinsic bag pressure in eq .",
    "( [ bag - pressure ] ) : for pions @xmath59 .",
    "the time @xmath60 for the bag to dissolve into its own radiation is approximately @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the degeneracy of mass @xmath16 particles , @xmath63 is the initial bag radius and @xmath64 is the initial bag total energy .",
    "the fluxes written in eqs .",
    "( [ part - flux ] ) and ( [ enrgy - flux ] ) ( particle or energy per unit surface area ) are integrated over an assumed spherical bag to give the result in eq .",
    "( [ bag - time ] ) . however , because of the lack of surface tension , the bag s maximum entropy corresponds to either an elongated ( cylinder ) or a flattened shape ( disc ) .",
    ".  ( [ bag - time ] ) should be interpreted as an upper limit .",
    "more detailed studies of hadron emission from bags concerning hydrodynamic shock waves and freeze out shocks can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the decoupling between the vapor concentration and @xmath16 and @xmath1 occurs when @xmath0 has completely evaporated ( i.e. when @xmath65 ) at a volume of @xmath66 the disappearance of @xmath0 allows the vapor concentration to decrease inversely proportionally to @xmath24 as @xmath67     and concentration @xmath68 as the function of the system s volume @xmath24 in the absence of restrictions ( solid curve ) and for a finite cut off at @xmath69 of the hagedorn spectrum ( dashed curve).,width=328,height=264 ]    the temperature , however , remains fixed at @xmath1 because of conservation of energy and particle number above @xmath70 .",
    "solid curves in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] show this schematically .",
    "the discussion above assumes that the hagedorn spectrum extends down to @xmath71 .",
    "however , experimentally there appears to be a lower cut off of the spectrum at @xmath69 .",
    "this modifies the above results as follows .    for energies @xmath72 and @xmath73 the above results hold as written",
    "however , if we increase the volume well beyond @xmath74 at which the hagedorn spectrum is truncated at @xmath69 , the situation is slightly different .",
    "@xmath0 evaporates until its mass is @xmath69 . if the entire mass of @xmath0 is fully transformed into vapor particles as the volume is increased further , then the excess particles temporarily increase the concentration and permanently decrease the temperature .",
    "as the volume increases further , the concentration changes inversely proportional to @xmath24 @xmath75 @xmath76 dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] show this schematically .",
    "a question of interest is the stability of @xmath0 against fragmentation . if the translational degrees of freedom are neglected , @xmath0 is indifferent to fragmentation into an arbitrary number of particles of arbitrary mass ( within the constraints of mass / energy conservation ) .",
    "let us now consider the case in which the mass of the vapor particle @xmath16 is allowed to be free .",
    "the system s level density @xmath45 is still given by eq .",
    "( [ full - part ] ) . using eqs .",
    "( [ max-01 ] ) and  ( [ numberpp ] ) , one finds the most probable value of the system s level density as @xmath77 $ ] , where the entropy is @xmath78 .",

    "since all the intrinsic statistical weights in @xmath79 are factored into a single @xmath0 the system breaks into fragments with @xmath82 except for one whose mass is determined by mass / energy conservation .    substituting the most probable value of @xmath33 and @xmath16 into the most probable value of @xmath52 one obtains the vapor concentration @xmath83 the density of the vapor of nonrelativistic particles acquires the form typical of the ultrarelativistic limit .    if the value of mass given by eq .",
    "( [ masspp ] ) does not exist , then the most probable value of level density @xmath84 corresponds to the mass @xmath85 which is nearest to @xmath86 and @xmath87 given by eq .",
    "( [ numberpp ] ) . in terms of hadron",
    "spectroscopy the value of @xmath85 that maximizes the level density @xmath84 is the pion mass .    if @xmath0 is required to fragment totally into a number of equal fragments all endowed with their translational degrees of freedom , then @xmath88^{\\frac{3}{2}n } \\nonumber \\\\   & = &   \\frac { { e^{\\frac{e } { t_{\\cal h } } } } ~ v^n}{n ! } \\left [ \\frac{m t_{\\cal h}}{2 \\pi } \\right]^{\\frac{3}{2}n } , \\label{equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last step we substituted the most probable value of the kinetic energy ( [ max-01 ] ) and used the stirling formula for @xmath89 . from eq .",
    "( [ equation ] ) it is seen that all the hagedorn factors collapse into a single one with the @xmath16-independent argument @xmath3 .",
    "maximization of ( [ equation ] ) with respect to @xmath16 leads to @xmath90 which is consistent with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , namely a single hagedorn particle with all the available mass .",
    "this result justifies the assumption of the canonical formulation of the statistical hadronization model that smaller clusters appear from a single large cluster @xcite .",
    "this again illustrates the indifference of @xmath0 toward fragmentation .",
    "of course eq .",
    "( [ max-01 ] ) gives directly the mass distribution of the hagedorn fragments under the two conditions discussed above .",
    "a system @xmath0 , with a hagedorn - like mass spectrum , is a perfect thermostat and a perfect particle reservoir .",
    "consequently , any system coupled to @xmath0 can have only the temperature of @xmath0 : @xmath1 .",
    "this behavior may explain the common value of : the hadronization temperatures obtained within statistical models ; the transition temperature from lattice qcd calculations for low baryonic density ; and the inverse slopes of the transverse mass spectra of hadrons ( temperature ) observed in high energy elementary particle collisions and high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions ( for details see @xcite ) .",
