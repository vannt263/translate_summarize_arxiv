    "studies of the high - redshift universe rely increasingly upon _ photometric redshifts _ to identify and map the distribution of distant galaxies .",
    "these photometric redshifts are estimated from the overall spectral shapes as traced by catalogs of photometric data , as opposed to fitting one or more spectroscopic features .",
    "photometric redshift surveys dramatically extend the possibilities of cosmological and galaxy evolutionary studies by vastly increasing the numbers and variety of galaxies beyond more observationally expensive spectroscopic galaxy surveys .    because galaxy redshift is such a fundamental property , understanding the errors in photometric redshift estimates is crucial for interpreting empirical findings .",

    "finally , a number of studies of photometric redshift accuracy have been conducted based on simulated mock galaxy catalogs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the first method is the most direct , but is typically biased towards very specific samples and the brightest galaxies for which spectroscopic redshifts are feasible : primarily at @xmath11 and for star - forming galaxies with bright emission lines .",
    "the second class of methods have different possible implementations , but in general these require large data sets , can lack sensitivity to certain types of systematic redshift errors or to catastrophic failures , and the results may be difficult to interpret . although mock catalogs are an attractive alternative and require no additional data , they are fundamentally limited by their ability to match the empirical diversity of an evolving galaxy population .",

    "additionally , although that study recommended median combining photometric redshifts using a multitude of fitting techniques , the ` eazy ` code was run by three different groups and consistently produced relatively low scatter and outlier fractions amongst the suite of redshift tests . in this work , we aim to quantify trends in the scatter between photometric and true redshifts as a function of galaxy properties as well as the occurrence rates of catastrophic failures .",

    "we conclude that for a significant fraction of catastrophic redshift outliers , the grism provides estimates of true redshifts of the photometric objects in the catalog that are as good or better than the spectroscopic redshifts and this difference could account for the difference in outlier fractions .",

    ".    additionally , trends in these panels are extremely helpful in interpreting figure [ fig : zphot_zgris_scatter_tight ] .",
    "for example , although the scatter of the full sample does not depend on stellar mass , scatter increases to @xmath92 for star - forming galaxies above @xmath93 .",
    "similarly , the increasing outlier fraction ( up to @xmath94 ) is due to star - forming galaxies alone ; photometric redshift accuracy does not appear to depend on stellar mass for quiescent galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "photometric redshift accuracy decreases more dramatically with magnitude for quiescent galaxies ( rising from @xmath95 at @xmath96 to @xmath97 at the faint end versus star - forming galaxies , which exhibit @xmath98 at all magnitudes .",
    "perhaps the most striking trend is with rest - frame color , where photometric redshift error and outlier fractions dramatically increase to @xmath99 and @xmath100 outliers at the reddest @xmath40 colors .",
    "this trend was also apparent in figure [ fig : zphot_zgris_scatter_tight ] , but it is now apparent that only star - forming galaxies are contributing to the increase in scatter and outlier fraction .",
    "these galaxies must be extremely dusty to explain their red colors and they appear to have highly degenerate redshifts with the current template set ( brammer et al .",
    ", in prep ) , despite the inclusion of the old , dusty template .",
    "it is noteworthy that this trend does not exist in the spectroscopic sample , highlighting the importance of the 3d - hst grism redshifts in fully characterizing photometric redshift performance .    these red , dusty star - forming galaxies are an increasingly prevalent population at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "estimating the photometric redshifts for galaxies that are both red in u - v and v - j colors is helped by including an appropriate dusty starburst template @xcite , but in general estimating their photometric redshifts becomes more difficult as the dust degrades the prominence of the break .",
    "not accounting for this growing population of galaxies can systematically place them at the wrong photometric redshifts @xcite , significantly influence the observed evolution of the stellar mass function for star - forming galaxies @xcite , and underestimate star formation rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the @xcite photometric redshift fits already include a dusty and old template in the ` eazy ` template set . in this case",
    ", the scatter and outlier fraction of the reddest galaxies points to a subset of extremely red star - forming galaxies for which photometric redshifts still consistently fail .",
    "the analysis in the previous subsection depended on the use of 3d - hst grism redshifts to estimate @xmath44 for galaxies in the photometric catalogs .",
    "we perform an independent test of the photometric redshift accuracy by following the close pairs analysis described by @xcite . due to the clustered nature of galaxies throughout space , galaxies which appear",
    "very near to one another projected on the sky are likely to be physically associated",
    ". if both galaxies are at the same true redshift , then differences in measured redshift will be due to the measurement and template / fitting errors .",
    "although true physical pairs can not be individually identified , @xcite defined a statistical method to utilize the distribution of these redshift differences , subtract out the contribution of chance alignment to the sample of close pairs in a survey , and calculate the photometric redshift errors .",
    "figure [ fig : pairs ] shows the redshift distributions of close pairs , after subtracting the contribution of random superpositions , for the entire photometric sample ( use_phot=1 ) in each of the 3d - hst fields ( in the @xmath29 footprint ) down to the approximate magnitude limit of the grism redshift sample ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "pairs are selected within 2 - 30 arcseconds of separation , with the lower limit to avoid erroneous correlations due to blending in the irac images .",
    "errors on the photometric redshifts of the pairs in the sample are related to a gaussian fit to the distribution as :    @xmath101    as with the grism redshift comparisons , measured photometric redshift uncertainty exhibits clear field - to - field variation ( see section [ sect : filters ] for a more detailed discussion of inhomogeneous photometric data ) .",
    "we calculate the overall scatter as the average of all five fields and utilize jackknife resampling to estimate errors given that the formal errors on each individual gaussian fit are negligible with respect to field - to - field variation .",
    "we calculate the photometric redshift errors following this method for galaxy pairs in bins of mass , magnitude , color and redshift , only including pairs for which both galaxies are included in the selection .",

    "for an evaluation of grism redshift accuracy via close pairs analysis , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "again these estimates of photometric redshift errors do not exhibit strong trends with stellar mass or u - v color ( as in figure [ fig : pairs_trends ] from grism redshift tests ) , although there is a clear decrease in scatter at the reddest colors .",
    "we note that galaxy pairs may sample the galaxy mass distribution differently than that of the full grism sample , which could lead to subtle differences in the estimates of redshift accuracies .",
    "on the other hand , the pairs - derived photometric errors depend slightly more strongly on @xmath22 magnitude .",
    "part of this is due to a small number of bright ( @xmath102 ) pairs of galaxies , however the trend extends to faint magnitudes .",
    "this may in part be due to the fact that the grism redshift sample is less complete below @xmath103 ( see figure [ fig : dist ] ) .",

    "we expect this correlation to be higher for galaxies without emission lines , particularly those with fainter continuum .",
    "this effect could contribute to the differences in scatter with magnitude .",
    "on the other hand , the photometric redshift errors estimated using close pairs could be artificially diminished by redshift `` attractors '' in photometric redshift space that artificially place galaxies at the same redshifts @xcite .",
    "for the faintest objects with @xmath104.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally , one benefit of photometric redshift accuracy based on statistical pairs analysis is that it is limited to the photometric depths , not those of the grism redshifts . in the case of the 3d - hst grism catalogs ,",
    "redshift fits can be made to an arbitrary limit , however we expect that these will only be valuable for galaxies with emission lines at fainter magnitudes .",

    "however , we note that the data included in each category will still vary in specific filter sets , photometric depths , and data quality . scatter and outlier fractions between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts in each of these categories and fields is included in figure [ fig : barplot_spec ] and for photometric and grism redshifts in figure [ fig : barplot_gris ] .",
    "the first thing to notice in figure [ fig : barplot_spec ] is that the scatter between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts varies significantly from field to field .",
    "this is due to a number of different factors , including heterogeneity in both the available photometry and spectroscopic followup in addition to cosmic variance .",
    "overall scatter is lowest in the cosmos field ( @xmath115 ) and highest in goods -",
    "n ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "this may in part be due to the optical and near - ir medium band photometry in the cosmos field .",
    "scatter is also low in goods - s , where photometry includes medium - band filters in the optical from the musyc survey , whereas the scatter in aegis is somewhat higher ( @xmath117 ) even though the nmbs near - ir medium band filters are included .",
    "the relative importance of optical medium - band filters is partially due to the redshift distribution of the spectroscopic comparison sample , most of which are at low redshift . using the grism redshifts , we can overcome this bias and assess the importance of filters in setting the photometric redshift accuracy for a more representative sample .",
    "comparing to grism redshifts has the effect of normalizing variable spectroscopic redshift quality and quantity ( figure [ fig : barplot_gris ] ) . in this case , the scatter and outlier fractions are somewhat more uniform across the five fields when all filters are included . in fields where hst acs f435w imaging is not available ( aegis , cosmos , uds ) , the scatter and outlier fraction of photometric redshifts are significantly higher when only hst imaging is fit .",
    "the inclusion of the blue filter in goods - n and goods - s introduces a decrease in scatter when only hst imaging is used to estimate photometric redshifts , although the effect is weaker than in the spectroscopic comparison .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of including blue wavelengths to identify spectral features such as the lyman break and the stellar bump .",
    "improvements in identifying these features can be made by including deep optical imaging , in particular medium - band imaging .",
    "another striking improvement in the photometric redshift accuracy is gained with the addition of spitzer irac imaging , in some cases decreasing the scatter by over a factor of two .",
    "it is interesting to note that the photometric redshift accuracy is uniformly worse when compared to the grism redshift sample than relative to the spectroscopic redshift sample , especially in the outlier fractions .",
    "this is likely because the grism redshifts probe regions of parameter space where photometric redshifts are harder to measure : fainter galaxies , higher redshifts , and different galaxy types .",

    "systematics in these redshift measurements are examined in individual fields in the appendix .",
    "this highlights the utility of the 3d - hst sample , but also emphasizes the importance of assessing the breadth of any spectroscopic sample used to evaluate photometric redshift performance .",
    "we emphasize that collapsing the redshift accuracy into these three measures disguises systematics introduced by different filter combinations .",
    "for example , low redshift ( @xmath120 ) galaxies are particularly driving the increased scatter in photometric redshift when only hst imaging ( @xmath121-@xmath30 ) is included .",
    "we included detailed figures including the redshift scatter in each individual field in appendix [ sect : fields ] .",
    "in addition to fitting a single - valued photometric redshift estimate , the ` eazy ` code produces individual probability distribution functions .",
    "these pdfs provide an estimate of the likelihood that the galaxy lies at a given true redshift . until this point",
    ", we have adopted the redshift with the maximum likelihood ( @xmath34 ) as the photometric redshift for each galaxy . for certain applications",
    ", we would like to incorporate the uncertainly on photometric redshift and ideally utilize the entire pdf function to describe the probability that the galaxy lies at a given @xmath44 .",
    "this technique has been proven to significantly improve measurement uncertainties , for example it can increase the s / n of clustering measurements by a factor equivalent to an increase in survey size of @xmath87 @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the ability of the ` eazy`-generated pdfs to predict the @xmath44 values for the ensemble of 3d - hst galaxies .",
    "a key question regarding photometric redshift performance is whether the scatter between measured and true redshifts is primarily driven by uncertainties in the photometric redshift estimates . for this",
    ", we test the redshift deviations for individual galaxies relative to their estimated confidence intervals .",

    "the photometric pdfs are a factor of @xmath126 too narrow , whereas the tails of the pdfs are further underestimated , requiring a factor of @xmath127 to explain the observed scatter between photometric and true redshift .",

    "the underestimation of the 68% confidence interval for photometric redshift errors is less than for the 95% and 99.7% confidence intervals .",
    "furthermore , we see clear trends that this depends on galaxy properties .",
    "in contrast with the measured scatter in photometric redshifts with stellar mass , photometric redshift errors are decreasingly well calibrated with increasing mass . aside from the brightest galaxies , which appear to have appropriate error estimates , the normalized scatter does not depend strongly on apparent magnitude or galaxy color .",

    "the right panel indicates strong correlation between photometric redshift scatter , as normalized by the redshift confidence intervals ; at the largest @xmath128 values this normalization may include the entire allowed redshift range , driving gaussian widths back to 1.0 .      in the previous section",

    "we now investigate the properties of these outliers .",
    "following @xcite , if the redshift error estimates are accurate for the entire population of galaxies , @xmath133 of galaxies will have 68% confidence intervals that include @xmath44 and likewise for the 95% and 99.7% confidence intervals .",

    "although the errorbars are somewhat broad , the actual redshift is well constrained between two narrower ranges .    to test the impact of such multipeaked pdfs , we rank redshift bins by p(z ) in the pdf of every galaxy ( as in the center panel of figure [ fig : pdf ] ) and estimate the cumulative probability that corresponds to the redshift bin in which the grism redshift lies ( right panel ) . in this specific example",
    ", grism redshift lies on a second redshift peak , outside of the 68% confidence interval ; calculated in this way the @xmath138 . with this computed for each galaxy in the tightened grism sample , we repeat the test of enclosed fractions as a function of galaxy properties . figure",
    "[ fig : conf_cum_fracs_trends ] presents the fraction of galaxies for which @xmath32 falls within the three defined confidence intervals .",
    "the average values for these fractions are remarkably similar to those derived via standard uncertainties .",
    "one can imagine problematic pdf with widely - separated multiple peaks for which the confidence intervals defined by the ` eazy ` code could overestimate the uncertainty , even though the errors on the whole are narrow with respect to the observed scatter . in practice , we do nt find evidence that this is a dominant effect , likely because the subset of these significantly multipeaked pdfs is small and therefore the average fraction of true redshifts that fall within a given confidence interval is largely independent of the method used to determine confidence intervals .",
    "although for the most part we find similar trends in fractions with galaxy properties as in figure [ fig : conf_fracs_trends ] , we do find a fairly strong trend of decreasing fractions of correctly estimated errors within each interval with increasing stellar mass .",
    "this is consistent with the trend in uncertainty normalized scatter which increases with stellar mass , as shown in figure [ fig : conf_int_trends ] .             for the mc sampled pdfs.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    , for comparison with grism redshifts .",
    "again the cumulative distributions of grism and photometric redshifts agree to within @xmath60 and mc sampled pdfs to within @xmath139,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we now shift to a related issue , and investigate how well the photometric redshifts can recover redshift distributions of a sample of galaxies .",
    "we compare the overall redshift distribution ( both of the spectroscopic sample and of the tightened grism sample ) to the distribution of single - valued photometric redshifts and those derived by bootstrap resampling of the individual photometric pdfs .",
    "the redshift histogram and cumulative distributions for the spectroscopic sample is presented in figure [ fig : ks_spec ] and for the grism sample in figure [ fig : ks_gris ] .",
    "we emphasize that while we expect the photometric and true redshift distributions to be similar , measurement errors and catastrophic outliers will broaden the photometric redshift distributions .",
    "therefore , these distributions should fail a simple kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test from a statistical standpoint , however the k - s statistic @xmath140 , or the maximum distance between each cumulative distribution functions , is still an informative metric of the relative similarity of the two distributions .        in figure",
    "[ fig : ks_spec ] , the two - sided ks test between the spectroscopic and z_peak redshift distributions indeed suggests a very low probability that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "however we find excellent agreement between the two histograms , with maximum deviations of less than @xmath141 .",
    "the distribution of monte - carlo sampled redshifts exhibits a larger deviation , but still agrees to within 4% with the spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "we interpret this as due to the additional scatter to each galaxy due to the pdf resampling .",
    "the comparison with grism redshifts ( figure [ fig : ks_gris ] ) yields similar results : 2% deviation for the comparison with z_peak and 3% deviations for the resampled redshifts .",
    "the full redshift distributions are not statistically consistent in either case , however given their similarity there are benefits to using the full redshift pdf .",
    "we note that although the distributions are more similar for the comparison with the single - valued @xmath34 photometric redshift estimates , there are instances in which the full redshift pdf carries additional useful information . for example , in the case of a multi - peaked pdf the @xmath34 carries only information about the most likely redshift , even when the secondary peak may be nearly as significant . sampling",
    "the entire pdf will scatter the redshifts for all galaxies , hence the increased deviations , but for multi - peaked pdfs will capture all possible solutions , given the fitting methodologies and templates .",

    "however , when the full sample of grism redshifts is included in the test , the measured scatter increases significantly , spanning from @xmath60 at @xmath151 to @xmath152 at @xmath89 .",
    "additionally , the number of catastrophic outliers increases dramatically with redshift from 5% to 25% .",
    "@xcite performed similar tests using mock catalogs and found slightly more optimistic results , with nmad scatter spanning @xmath153 ( red dashed lines in nmad and outlier panels ) . aside from the lowest redshift bin , where the cosmos field is small and the grism adds little to the redshift determination , photometric redshift accuracy predicted from the mock catalogs is optimistic .",
    "estimates from mock catalogs are lower by up to a factor of two compared to simulations leveraging real data .",
    "the des survey is a photometric survey of 5000 @xmath143 of the southern sky that includes @xmath154 imaging using the dark energy camera @xcite . according to the survey description document ,",
    "the target 5-@xmath2 limiting magnitudes for point sources in the des survey will be @xmath155 and @xmath156 . as each of these limits is shallower than the imaging in cosmos",
    ", we are able to accurately create a simulated catalog . additionally , the des footprint overlaps with the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ) which can complement the des optical data with near - ir jhk imaging over @xmath157 @xmath143 down to limiting magnitudes of @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : des ] demonstrates the photometric redshift performance for the spectroscopic and grism samples in the simulated des survey and figure [ fig : des_vhs ] includes both des and vhs filters . for the des filters alone , we find that the photometric redshift scatter will be higher than for the lsst ( @xmath159 ) and will increase to @xmath160 by a redshift of 2.5 .",
    "this is partially due to the omission of the @xmath161 filter and shallower depths of the des survey .",
    "additionally , from the grism sample , we predict that the outlier fraction will be quite high with only des imaging ( @xmath162 ) . these estimates are somewhat different from those found in a study by @xcite ( red dashed line on figures [ fig : des ] and [ fig : des_vhs ] ) , which found very similar scatter , but lower outlier fractions .",
    "we note that @xcite adopted a slightly different definition ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "we include outliers defined in this way as a black dashed line in figures [ fig : des ] and [ fig : des_vhs ] and find closer agreement between the two studies .",
    "we find that the addition of near - ir photometry with the vhs specifications improves the photometric redshift performance dramatically , in contrast with the findings of @xcite . when these data are included , the mean nmad scatter decreases to @xmath139 , with an increase to @xmath159 above @xmath164 .",
    "in a comparison with the grism redshifts , which will be less biased than the spectroscopic catalogs used by @xcite , we find a lower outlier fraction of @xmath118 versus 10% .",
    "this average value decreases even further with the less strict outlier threshold ( @xmath163 )    we emphasize that simulations like those presented in this section are overly simplistic .",
    "the filters used in planned or on - going surveys may not exactly match those used in the 3d - hst catalogs .",
    "furthermore , although we attempt to match quoted catalog depths , there will naturally be differences in image quality ( e.g. seeing ) and redshift fitting methodology that will influence photometric redshift performance .",
    "in particular , the cosmos catalogs are hst - detected , therefore ground - based photometry will suffer more dramatically from blending .",
    "furthermore , the redshift accuracy in the cosmos field is excellent when only the broad - band optical and near - ir imaging is included ( see e.g. figure [ fig : barplot_gris ] ) , therefore these estimates could further be a generous estimate of photometric redshift performance in the planned surveys .",
    "we emphasize the discrepancies between the mock and empirical predictions presented in this section and suggest the importance of including empirical tests with representative spectroscopic samples in addition to mock simulations in order to robustly predict photometric redshift accuracy .",
    "studies of the high redshift universe are increasingly reliant on photometric redshifts to probe fainter targets in scope and variety than are inaccessible to even the most ambitious spectroscopic campaigns .",
    "the goal of this paper is to assess and quantify the photometric redshift accuracy in the 3d - hst photometric catalogs .",
    "we summarize the major findings below :    * the 3d - hst photometric catalogs consist of psf - matched aperture photometry across @xmath165 square arcminutes in the candels extragalactic field , including ground and spaced - based imaging from @xmath166 .",
    "overall , photometric redshift quality in the catalogs , calculated using ` eazy ` @xcite , is excellent , with an overall characteristic scatter of @xmath167 down to @xmath168 .",
    "this result is fairly robust to measurement technique , e.g. comparison with spectroscopic or grism redshifts versus galaxy pair counts , although it does vary amongst the five fields by @xmath169 . * the characteristic , or nmad",
    ", scatter does not depend strongly on galaxy stellar mass or u - v rest - frame color , however we do find significant variations in the fraction of catastrophic outliers ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "photometric redshift scatter increases by @xmath171 with apparent magnitude ( down to the limiting magnitude of @xmath172 ) and redshift ( out to @xmath173 ) .",
    "analysis of close pairs suggests that redshift accuracy further degrades for fainter objects , reaching @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "* we confirm that the error estimates and pdfs produced by the ` eazy ` code are narrow with respect to the photometric redshift scatter , but this underestimation can not be improved by uniformly broadening the pdfs .",
    "furthermore , errors in photometric redshift estimates do not capture the outlier behavior .",
    "however , the effect on the derived overall properties of a sample may be subtle ; the overall spectroscopic / grism and photometric redshift distributions as probed by single valued estimates and full pdfs agree to within @xmath174 . in many specific cases , such as deriving luminosity or mass functions , scatter and outliers can tend to bias the derived properties . although the size of this bias is not immediately calculable , it must be simulated for any given survey , magnitude limit , and redshift range . *",
    "finally , a fraction of the field - to - field variation in photometric redshift quality can be attributed to the heterogenous nature of available imaging bands .",
    "we investigate the contribution of various filter combinations on the derived redshift accuracy , highlighting the dramatic impact driven by the inclusion of spitzer - irac photometry , blue ( f435w ) hst photometry , and medium - band filters particularly in the optical .",
    "the conclusions from this paper extend far beyond the use of the 3d - hst catalogs and can be applied in the interpretation of current surveys for which grism spectroscopy is not available .",
    "furthermore , the systematics in redshift accuracy can be used in the planning of future surveys . to illustrate this possibility , we included simulations of photometric redshift performance in the lsst , des , and des plus vhs datasets in ",
    "[ sect : sim_surveys ] .",
    "this type of empirical simulation could more realistically reflect the input galaxy population than a spectroscopic or mock catalog , which could yield overly optimistic estimates for redshift accuracy .",
    "additionally , the demonstrated filter - dependence can influence survey design choices .",
    "for example , the inclusion of blue ( f435w ) imaging in the goods fields significantly improved both the scatter and outlier fractions .",
    "one key question in planning photometric surveys is the balance between depth in broad filters and shallower imaging in narrower filters .",
    "the significant improvement in photometric redshift accuracy , especially in the outlier fraction , due to the inclusion of medium band imaging for the current sample , centered at @xmath175 , can inform future studies of the earlier universe .",
    "similar medium band imaging in the near - ir , as used by the newfirm medium band survey ( nmbs ) @xcite and fourstar galaxy evolution survey ( zfourge ) survey ( i. labb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) could be crucial for future studies at higher redshift to maximize confidence in redshift estimates for individual galaxies as opposed to their statistical properties .",
    "for the most part , we have treated the 3d - hst catalogs as a uniform photometric sample .",
    "however , aside from the availability of optical and near - ir hst imaging and spitzer irac photometry , each field includes a heterogenous collection of photometry and spectroscopic redshifts . in this appendix",
    ", we show the scatter between photometric redshifts and true redshifts ( grism and spectroscopic ) for each field and subset of photometry ( figures [ fig : scatt_fields_spec ] and [ fig : scatt_fields_gris ] ) .",
    "panels in each figure are divided into fields , with the redshifts from the full photometric catalog included in the top left panel ( gray points ) and redshifts measured from subsets of filters in the additional panels ( blue points ) .",
    "figure [ fig : scatt_fields_spec ] includes comparisons with spectroscopic redshifts and figure [ fig : scatt_fields_gris ] with grism redshifts . measured scatter and outlier fractions are included in table [ tbl : photoz_filters ] .",
    "these figures illuminate some of the reasons for the strong field - to - field variance in photometric redshift scatter and outlier fractions shown in figures [ fig : barplot_spec ] and [ fig : barplot_gris ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : scatt_fields_spec ] it is apparent that the spectroscopic redshift follow - up varies wildly from field - to - field . for example , goods - n exhibits significantly more scatter than the other fields , however it also includes much better sampling of @xmath13 galaxies e.g. than cosmos , which has a amazingly tight relationship between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts . on the other hand ,",
    "good - s also includes a large number of high redshift galaxies , but much lower nmad scatter .",
    "differences in spectroscopic datasets do not explain the full field - to - field variation as the variations persist in comparisons with grism redshifts ( figure [ fig : scatt_fields_gris ] ) , where the redshift coverage should be approximately uniform .",
    "still cosmos and goods - s , which both have medium band optical imaging , have the most accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "these optical filters appear to have a greater effect than medium band filters in the near - ir , which are included in the aegis and cosmos fields from the nmbs survey @xcite .",
    "we expect this is due to the redshift distribution probed by the grism ; at higher redshifts , such deep medium band imaging should be increasingly important .",
    "we find many systematics are introduced by including various subsets of photometric bands in the redshift fitting .",
    "although we have discussed some of these trends in section [ sect : filters ] , we include all tests in separate panels in these figures to illustrate some of the systematic redshift failures that are behind the increased scatter and catastrophic failure rates .",
    "for example , it is clear that irac photometry breaks an important degeneracy that systematically narrows the distribution of photometric redshifts towards @xmath103 , improves the accuracy at @xmath89 , and discriminates between low redshift ( @xmath11 ) and very high redshift galaxies ( @xmath176 ) .",
