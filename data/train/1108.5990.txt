    "the main property of quasiperiodic solutions of the type ( [ qp ] ) is that they are motions on a 2-torus without frequency locking .",
    "those solutions are sometimes called modulated waves @xcite or modulated rotating waves @xcite or relative periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "we assume that the following nondegeneracy condition holds : @xmath27 it is easy to verify that ( [ eq : nondeg ] ) is true for all @xmath28 if it holds for one @xmath29 .",
    "condition ( [ eq : nondeg ] ) implies that the set @xmath30 which is invariant with respect to the flow corresponding to ( [ 02 ] ) , is a two - dimensional torus .",

    ", @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where stable locking of the modulation frequencies @xmath32 of the forcing and @xmath36 of the solution ( [ qp ] ) occurs , i.e. where the following holds : for almost any solution @xmath37 to ( [ 01 ] ) , which is at a certain moment close to @xmath38 , there exists @xmath39 such that @xmath40    our results essentially differ in the so - called non - degenerate and degenerate cases ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the degenerate case includes all cases when the averaged ( with respect to the fast wave oscillations ) forcing @xmath41 vanishes identically , for example , if @xmath17 is of the type @xmath42 . roughly speaking , under additional generic conditions the following is true :    _ non - degenerate case : _",
    "if @xmath31 is sufficiently large and @xmath33 is sufficiently small and @xmath43 is of order @xmath33 , then locking occurs .",
    "_ degenerate case : _",
    "if @xmath31 is sufficiently large and @xmath44 is sufficiently small and @xmath43 is of order @xmath44 , then locking occurs .",
    "the present paper extends previous work on this topic for particular types of the vector field @xmath9 and the forces @xmath17 @xcite . in particular , the considered special cases in @xcite are doubly degenerate in the sense that not only the averaged forcing ( [ av ] ) vanishes but also the second averaging term turns to zero .",
    "remark that in @xcite related results are described for the case that both differences of modulation and wave frequencies are small , and @xcite concerns the case when the internal state as well as the external forcing are not modulated . for an even more abstract setting of these results see @xcite",
    ".    systems of the type ( [ 01 ] ) appear as models for the dynamical behavior of self - pulsating lasers under the influence of external periodically modulated optical and/or electrical signals , see , e.g. @xcite , and for related experimental results see @xcite . in ( [ 01 ] ) the state variable @xmath45 describes the electron density and the optical field of the laser .",
    "in particular , the euclidian norm @xmath46 describes the sum of the electron density and the intensity of the optical field .",
    "the @xmath0-equivariance of ( [ 02 ] ) is the result of the invariance of autonomous optical models with respect to shifts of optical phases .",
    "the solution ( [ qp ] ) describes a so - called self - pulsating state of the laser in the case that the laser is driven by electric currents which are constant in time . in those states",
    "the electron density and the intensity of the optical field are time periodic with the same frequency .",
    "self - pulsating states usually appear as a result of hopf bifurcations from so - called continuous wave states , where the electron density and the intensity of the optical field are constant in time .",
    "external forces of the type @xmath47 appear for describing an external optical injection with optical frequency @xmath31 and modulation frequency @xmath32 . in spatially extended laser models those forces appear as inhomogeneities in the boundary conditions .",
    "after homogenization of those boundary conditions and finite dimensional mode approximations ( or galerkin schemes ) one ends up with systems of type ( [ 01 ] ) with general forces of the type @xmath48 with ( [ eq : symg ] ) .",
    "external forces of the type @xmath49 appear for describing an external electrical injection with modulation frequency @xmath32 .",

    "the corresponding variational equation around this solution is @xmath53 it is easy to verify ( see section [ sec : unperturbed - system ] ) , that ( [ 0per1 ] ) has two linear independent ( because of assumption ( [ eq : nondeg ] ) ) periodic solutions @xmath54 which correspond to the two trivial floquet multipliers 1 of the periodic solution @xmath55 to ( [ newcoord ] ) .",
    "one of these floquet multipliers appears because of the @xmath0-equivariance of ( [ newcoord ] ) , and the other one because ( [ newcoord ] ) is autonomous . from the exponential orbital stability of ( [ qp ] )",
    "it follows that the trivial floquet multiplier 1 of the periodic solution @xmath55 to ( [ newcoord ] ) has multiplicity two , and the absolute values of all other multipliers are less than one .",
