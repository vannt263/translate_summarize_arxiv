    "the generation of fermion and gauge boson masses in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics requires the existence of a higgs boson , which was discovered in 2012 at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern  @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible that there are additional higgs bosons , as described by extended higgs models .",
    "such additional higgs bosons typically have different masses than that of the sm higgs and can have nonzero electric charge .",
    "arguably the most important constraint in the exploration of extended higgs sectors is veltman s @xmath1 parameter  @xcite , defined in terms of the ratio of strengths of the low - energy neutral and charged weak currents , which has been measured with great precision to be  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the @xmath5 and @xmath6 boson masses , respectively , and @xmath7 is the weak mixing angle .",

    "higher - isospin solutions violate perturbative unitarity of _ transverse _ vector boson scattering due to their excessively large weak charges  @xcite , leaving the septet as the only perturbative exotic higgs - sector extension in this class .    the scalar septet model , which contains such a septet in addition to the usual sm higgs doublet , was first studied in refs .  @xcite",
    ". a challenge of this model is that , at the renormalizable level , it preserves an accidental global u(1 ) symmetry in the scalar potential that is broken when the septet obtains a vev , leading to a physical massless goldstone boson that couples to fermions and mediates long - range forces .",
    "this was solved in ref .",
    "@xcite by introducing a dimension - seven effective operator coupling one septet to six higgs doublet fields , which can be generated at the one - loop level in a fairly simple ultraviolet completion .",

    "the perturbative unitarity of longitudinal vector boson scattering amplitudes can be exploited to constrain the couplings of the custodial fiveplet scalars , and hence the vevs of the higher - isospin scalars , for high masses around the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "while the scalar septet model preserves @xmath16 , its scalar spectrum does not exhibit custodial symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that longitudinal vector boson scattering is unitarized by the charged scalars in a similar way to that in the georgi - machacek model , and use the finite parts of the scattering amplitudes to set an upper bound on the septet vev at high septet masses .",
