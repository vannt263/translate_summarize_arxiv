    "accretion disks are present in many astrophysical systems , with firm evidence for their existence in environments as diverse as those of young stars @xcite , close binary systems and agn ( frank , king & raine 1985 ) . objects known to include hot optically - thick disks typically provide clear spectroscopic evidence of mass loss in the form of broad blueshifted uv absorption features .",
    "currently there are two main driving mechanisms envisaged for disk winds .",
    "the more widely studied of these , regarded as the only option for low - mass ysos , relies on mhd processes ( e.g. ouyed & pudritz 1997 , hirose et al .",
    "1997 , konigl & pudritz 2000 ) . in high luminosity systems",
    "an alternative or additional method for driving an outflow is radiation pressure mediated by line opacity ( hence the term ` line - driven wind ' ) . until recently the multi - dimensional modelling required to deal with the geometry of a line - driven disk wind was beyond reach .",
    "however , this problem has now been approached numerically , with greater success , in the models of pereyra , kallman & blondin ( 1997 ) and proga , stone & drew ( 1998 , hereafter psd ) . as a result of this work",
    ", the radiation - driven wind model already provides some clear - cut predictions that can be put to the test against observations .",
    "pre - eminent among these is the expectation that the wind mass loss rate will show a strong dependence on system luminosity ( see drew & proga 2000 ) .",
    "psd also predict unstable , clumpy outflow in the regime where the accretion disk , rather than the central object , contributes most of the radiant luminosity .",
    "indeed , psd s simulations suggested that the dominant mass loss stream flowing away from the inner disk will include denser clumps of gas that fail to reach escape velocity and collapse back onto the disk at larger radii .",
    "a better treatment of the line - driving ( proga , stone & drew 1999 ) preserves this impression of a highly structured , clumpy outflow . when observed spectroscopically with a time resolution of less than the typical flow timescale this phenomenon could make itself apparent as narrow absorption components , superposed on the broad blueshifted absorption profile , sweeping both away from and in towards line centre .    with the aim of looking for the spectral signatures of disk - wind variability on suitably short timescales we have obtained _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observations of two high - state cataclysmic variables , using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "specifically , our targets are the nova - like variables : ix vel and v3885 sgr .",
    "these binaries provide examples of disk winds where the line - driving mechanism may dominate over mhd processes in powering mass loss .",
    "both ix  vel and v3885  sgr are made up of a low mass star overflowing its roche lobe and transferring matter to a non- or weakly - magnetic white dwarf ( wd ) via an accretion disk ( i.e. they are ux  uma type cataclysmic variables ) .",
    "both are known to persist in a high brightness state , powered by high mass accretion rates ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this puts these objects just within the domain where disk luminosities are @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the eddington luminosity ) and spectral line opacity may be sufficient to power significant mass loss @xcite . essentially all of the light from these systems at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths is due to accretion . a further factor influencing target choice",
    "is that ix  vel and v3885  sgr are the brightest of the known ux  uma binaries . with the possibility of high - quality observation of the wind - shaped uv line profiles",
    ", these binaries can provide a particularly good test bed for line - driven disk wind models .    on timescales of weeks and months ,",
    "ix  vel and v3885  sgr vary by several tenths of a magnitude . in order to allow this secular variation to provide a sampling of a modest range of luminosity states , both targets",
    "were observed three times each at intervals of at least a month .",
    "both targets are non - eclipsing systems .",
    "the broad blueshifted absorption features seen in the uv , that are indeed a common feature of the lower inclination ux uma systems , are not usually very deep , making them ideal for studying the fine structure of wind - formed lines . to obtain the high time and wavelength resolution required for this programme ,",
    "stis was employed in its time - tag observing mode , using an echelle to disperse the light .",
    "this allows the observer to select the desired wavelength or time resolution at the point of data extraction and calibration . to ensure a minimum s / n ratio there is necessarily a trade - off such that higher time resolution will result in a reduced useable spectral resolution and vice - versa",
    "this is not the first use of the _ hst _  spectrographs for high time resolution studies of cataclysmic variable disk winds : prinja et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , ( 2000b ) report results of goddard high resolution spectrometer ( ghrs ) grating observations of respectively bz  cam and v603  aql .",
    "these data gave a time resolution of @xmath080 and @xmath030 seconds , timescales that are also comparable with the likely outflow timescales in these binaries ( of order a few tens up to @xmath0100 seconds ) .",
    "significant absorption line profile variability on timescales down to @xmath6  sec was reported .",
    "the key differences between these published studies and the present study lie in data quality  our brighter targets allow the use of the higher resolution echelle  and in the prior knowledge of the targets uv spectral characteristics .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we present a brief description of the stis / time - tag observations ( section [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the results are then presented in two ways : in section [ sec : secular ] we describe the time - averaged spectrum obtained at each epoch of observation , and then in [ sec : timevar ] we re - present the data as spectral time - series at 30-sec time - resolution . in section [ sec : discus ] , the results obtained are put into context and we review the variability uncovered in ix  vel and v3885  sgr and compare with the prior examples of bz  cam and v603  aql . prompted by",
    "our finding that wind activity seems to show no correlation with luminosity ( thereby challenging the pure radiation - driven disk wind model ) , we revisit earlier - generation _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) spectroscopy of ix  vel in order to seek further evidence of this ( section [ subsec : discus3 ] ) .",
    "we close with some thoughts on the next move in the quest for a fuller understanding of the driving of these accretion disk winds .",
    "observations were performed by the stis instrument on the hubble space telescope , with the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) mama detector ( 11401735 ) .",
    "the e140 m echelle grating with a central wavelength of 1425  was used .",
    "this configuration provides a resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "v3885 sgr was observed with the 0.2@xmath80.2  aperture .",
    "ix vel , the brighter target , had to be observed with the 0.1@xmath80.03  slit to reduce the likelihood of buffer overflow .",
    "each observation was performed in a single telescope orbit for the maximum available time , with the detector set to time - tag mode .",
    "the dates and exposure times of our observations are given in table [ tab : obs_dates ] .",
    ".the observation dates and times for each _ hst _  observation . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     circumstantially , if not absolutely conclusively , it would appear that there is not the expected strong positive correlation between apparent mass loss and luminosity .",
    "a key prediction of the radiatively - driven disk wind model is flouted .",
    "the flow timescale in cataclysmic binaries like ix  vel and v3885  sgr is likely to be a few tens of seconds ( assuming a castor & lamers type velocity law from 40 to 5000integrated over a distance @xmath9 ) .",
    "this is sufficiently short that the wind dynamical configuration is able to adjust continuously to the changing radiant flux as long as this does not vary markedly on an even shorter timescale . in neither object",
    "is there evidence of this either in our data or , historically , from observations of flickering ( e.g. williams & hiltner 1984 , cowley et al 1977 ) .",
    "hence , it is not an option to invoke a concept of e.g. hysteresis to explain the absence of the expected steep relation between luminosity and mass loss rate .",
    "we conclude that neither ix  vel nor v3885  sgr knows they have to obey such a relation !      now that quantitative models of radiation - driven disk winds have appeared , and there are high quality data to match them .",
    "it can be seen more clearly that a factor other than line - driving is much more likely to be decisive in powering these outflows .",
    "our findings add to the doubts over the years that line - driving can not sustain the mass loss rates observation seems to imply ( see mauche & raymond 2000 , drew & proga 2000 ) .",
    "the de facto exclusion of a class of models is progress .",
    "it is now time to examine the alternatives with renewed intent .",
    "mhd driving has long been viewed as a possible contributor or sole cause of mass loss ( cannizzo & pudritz 1988 , see also comments in drew 1991 ) .",
    "this option has become more attractive again in recent years as the magneto - rotational instability has emerged as a favoured angular momentum transport mechanism for cv disks ( balbus & hawley 1998 , tout 2000 ) .",
    "perhaps the most promising alternative to a pure line - driven disk wind model is a hybrid model where a wind is driven from the disk by some combination of mhd and line forces .",
    "calculations combining the two driving mechanisms rigorously do not exist yet .",
    "however we can refer to some schematic predictions of radiation - driven disk wind models where the main role of an ordered magnetic field is to impose angular velocity , rather than angular momentum , conservation ( proga 2000 ) . for @xmath10 , imposing corotation on a line - driven disk wind model increases the wind mass loss rate : the smaller the angle between the poloidal streamlines and the disk midplane the larger mass loss rate ( cf .",
    "blandford & payne 1982 ) .",
    "for @xmath11 a few times @xmath12 , @xmath13 is as in a pure line - driven disk wind model . in terms of the @xmath13 vs @xmath14 relationship , it means that for a relatively low disk luminosity ( i.e. @xmath15 ) , the mass loss rate can increase or decrease depending on the streamline geometry required by prevailing magnetic fields .",
    "this control of @xmath13 , independent of the radiant luminosity , can potentially explain our observations because these sample the luminosity range where this additional dependence is expected .",
    "as noted already , enforcement of flow streamlines by a large scale magnetic field would also be consistent with the near absence of detected wind inhomogeneity .    on the other hand , the fact that a radiation - driven wind can be produced only when @xmath15 , has a basic appeal in explaining the behaviour of other cvs such as dwarf novae ( dn ) .",
    "the uv observations of dn through outburst obtained by _",
    "iue_have provided evidence of mass loss signatures tracking luminosity . for example , it has been noted during declines of dn from maximum light that a decay of the uv continuum by a factor of @xmath16 can be accompanied by a near disappearance of the blueshifted absorption so prominent at maximum ( woods & drew 1990 ; woods et al .",
    "if this correlation proves to be indirect rather than causal , we have work to do to uncover the controlling physics behind it .",
    "the way forward is to identify for further development one of the many variants of mhd disk wind model already explored in the literature that can provide a convincing explanation , either with or without the assistance of line - driving , of the continuing puzzle of these disk winds .",
    "once again the accretion disk winds in cvs have emerged as particularly open and rewarding laboratories for studying disk mass loss .",
    "an intriguing issue for the future is the existence or not of flow collimation of cv disk winds if even cv disk winds are mhd powered ( see knigge & livio 1998 ) .",
    "as these problems are tackled we can also hope to obtain greater insight into the nature of disk winds in other astrophysical settings .",
    "this paper is based on observations made with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 .",
    "these observations are associated with proposal 8279 .",
