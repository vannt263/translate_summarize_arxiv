    "in addition to triggering starbursts and active galactic nuclei , mergers of dusty , gas rich disk galaxies frequently lead to the formation of tidal tails stretching @xmath14100 kpc from the site of the collision ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; schweizer 1978 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "these structures tend to be hi rich with blue optical colors , reflecting both their origin in the outer spiral disk and on - going star formation ( van der hulst 1979 ; schombert wallin & struck - marcell 1990 , mirabel , lutz & mazza 1991 ; hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) .",
    "zwicky ( 1956 ) proposed that dwarf galaxies might form out of self - gravitating clumps within tidal tails , and indeed , concentrations of gas and star forming regions , with dwarf galaxy size hi masses and optical luminosities , are commonly found .",
    "computer simulations of merging galaxies typically give timescales of @xmath15 years for the formation of condensations at the tips of the @xmath1 100 kpc tails , indicating that any young stellar population has been formed in - situ and has not simply been stripped from the host galaxy disk .",
    "the cataloging of tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) is still in its infancy .",
    "kinematic observations alleviate potential contamination from foreground and background objects",
    ". however projection effects can give the appearance of a bound object to unbound condensations in the debris left over from galaxy interactions .",
    "a bona fide tdg should be self - gravitating , rotating , long - lived and tidal in origin .",
    "tidal origin and longevity can only be inferred from comparison of the source morphology and kinematics with simulations .",
    "it is often impossible to fully disentangle tidal effects from other dynamical effects such as ram pressure stripping .",
    "whether or not most candidate tdgs are subject to tidal disruption and re - absorption by the merger remnant on @xmath1gyr timescales is still an open question ( e.g. , hibbard & mihos 1995 ; elmegreen , kaufman & thomasson 1993 ) .",
    "the formation of both tdgs and transient unbound star - forming regions will enrich the outer regions of the inter - galaxy medium .    the study of dwarf irregular proto / young galaxies formed either via tidal interactions between the parent galaxies or from ram - sweeping of debris material , and collectively called tdgs , may be an important part of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "tdgs located at the tips of optically faint but hi rich tails represent new star forming systems largely free of pre - existing stellar populations , and represent useful templates of star formation in the early universe , albeit with higher metallicity ( duc & mirabel 1998 , hereafter , dm98 ) .",
    "more importantly , dwarf galaxies are by far the most common galaxy type in the current epoch , accounting for 38 out of 41 galaxies in the local group alone ( mateo 1998 ) .",
    "work by hunsberger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggests that tdgs may make up at least 1/3 and possibly 1/2 of the dwarf galaxy population in compact groups i.e. , a potentially significant galaxy formation mechanism in the current epoch .",
    "one problem with this scenario is dark matter .",
    "like massive spirals , dwarf galaxies appear to be dominated by dark matter .",
    "if dark matter is non - baryonic it is hard to form a halo around a dwarf galaxy that has been formed via tidal interaction .",
    "if the dark matter is baryonic i.e. , cold molecular gas ( pfenniger , combes & martinet 1994 ) then the tdg / dwarf association remains a valid possibility .",
    "both the nature of dark matter and whether the dynamical masses of tdgs infers its presence are still open questions",
    ".    studies of tdg properties may help us better understand the dwarf galaxy population as a whole , such as what fraction are truly primordial building blocks of massive galaxies left over from the epoch of galaxy formation , and what fraction may be tdgs from high and intermediate red - shifts .",
    "this is especially relevant as the merger rate was likely much higher at z @xmath10 1 than it is today . to date the tdg sample is still too small to statistically assess the importance of this population of objects .",
    "that assessment will be made in due course . whether rare or ubiquitous , these objects warrant detailed study . here",
    "we utilize the unique capabilities of the spitzer space telescope ( werner et al .",
    "2004a ) to study the ngc  5291 system , which is known for its remarkably rich proto / young galaxy nursery .    ngc",
    "5291 is a disturbed elliptical / lenticular galaxy located at the western edge of the cluster abell 3574 .",
    "pedersen et al . (",
    "1978 ) briefly discussed deep images of the system taken with the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "they highlighted the presence of many optical knots , which they suggested were extragalactic hii regions .",
    "longmore et al .",
    "1979 ( hereafter , l79 ) published a much more detailed investigation . using deep schmidt plates with filters approximating b ( @xmath16 3950 - 5400    schott gg395 filter / iii - aj emulsion ) and u ( @xmath16 3200 - 3900    schott ug1 filter / iii - aj emulsion ) passbands they found 24 blue knots extending across an arc centered on ngc  5291 and obtained spectra of the eight brightest .",
    "they identified the knots as giant extragalactic hii regions , but noted that both the projected linear size and optical luminosity of the largest knots were greater than the large magellanic cloud . coincidentally ,",
    "maza et al . ( 1991 ) also obtained spectra of the brightest optical knot , which was included in an object prism survey of hii galaxies .",
    "using the parkes radio telescope , l79 also discovered a large hi mass ( @xmath110@xmath17 m@xmath4 ) associated with ngc  5291 and its blue knots though slightly displaced to the west .",
    "malphrus et al . ( 1997 , hereafter , m97 ) mapped the hi 21 cm emission using the vla .",
    "the hi morphology resembles a large fragmented ring with a continuous eastern arc stretching @xmath1 4 arcmin ( 72 kpc ) on either side of ngc  5291 .",
    "the eastern half of the ring contains most of the neutral hydrogen as well as the highest hi surface densities , and is associated with both ngc  5291 and its knots of star formation .",
    "the origin of this giant hi ring is still unclear .",
    "ngc  5291 has a disturbed companion galaxy called the `` seashell '' , however it is unlikely that this galaxy is linked to the hi ring s formation as it is both gas poor and has a much higher radial velocity ( @xmath1600 km s@xmath18 ) relative to ngc  5291 , indicating a high fly - by velocity ( l79 , @xmath10 400 km s@xmath18 , dm98 ) .",
    "l79 discussed several models for the origin of ngc  5291 .",
    "they noted that the optical morphology is similar to the antennae ( ngc 4038/39 ) and that there are two other galaxies ( # 435 and 446 in richter 1984 ) within 150 kpc projected distance from ngc  5291 that may be responsible for a tidal interaction .",
    "however m97 rule out the interplay for both galaxies .",
    "they detected richter 435 , which lies @xmath1 4   southwest of ngc  5291 , in hi , but with a heliocentric velocity @xmath1 250 kms@xmath18 lower than the hi ring .",
    "m97 found that , like the seashell , there is little hi associated with the second candidate galaxy richter 446 , @xmath1 5   northeast of ngc  5291 .",
    "however , l79 s preferred model for the system is that a pre - existing giant hi disc has undergone compression and possible ram pressure sweeping by the intra - cluster medium as the system falls into the cluster from the far side .",
    "l79 suggested that the knots could eventually form a population of blue dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "the combined optical and vla observations led m97 to revive the tidal model and they conclude that the system is probably both interacting and likely being ram - swept as it moves through the intra - cluster medium .",
    "however mysterious its origin the ngc  5291 system is a remarkable galactic nursery .",
    "m97 investigated whether the knots are self - gravitating and will remain bound against the tidal force of the parent galaxy to become dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "they compared the hi mass for each knot to the binding mass .",
    "they argued that for the two most massive hi clumps , ngc  5291  n ( hereafter , tdg - n ) , and ngc  5291  s ( hereafter , tdg - s ) the combined mass of stars and gas will result in self - gravitating knots .",
    "m97 also calculated the radius at which material in a knot would be disrupted by the tidal force with the parent galaxy and compared it to the projected radius of the hi knots .",
    "the majority of the knots , including tdg - n and tdg - s , appear to be tidally stable .",
    "using h@xmath19 fabry - perot observations borunaud et al .",
    "( 2004 ) were able to determine the rotation curve for tdg - n , clearly showing that it is self - gravitating and rotating .",
    "they concluded that higher resolution observations are required to assess the presence of dark matter .    before the launch of the spitzer space telescope , mid - infrared spectroscopic studies of objects as faint as tdgs were not feasible .",
    "we have taken advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity of the spitzer space telescope to obtain irs spectra of the two optically brightest tdgs in the ngc  5291 system , tdg - n and tdg - s at the northern and southern - most tips of the high surface density hi arc .",
    "the mid - infrared region of the spectrum is rich in atomic and molecular emission features from the star forming ism , including fine structure lines like [ ne  ii ] , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) and warm molecular hydrogen .",
    "this will allow comparisons with similar mid - infrared studies of other star forming galaxies from dwarf irregulars to massive spirals .",
    "we have also imaged the eastern half of the hi ring , including the associated proto / young irregular galaxy population , ngc  5291 and the `` seashell '' , with the infrared array camera ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 , irac ) .",
    "we assess the relative contributions from both cool ( evolved and low mass main sequence ) stars and from star formation as traced by pah emission in the 8.0 @xmath0 m band .",
    "the resulting mid - infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and colors will allow useful comparisons with other galaxy types .",
    "in @xmath202 we detail the observations and data reduction .",
    "@xmath203 begins with the results and discussion of the the mid - infrared spectral properties of tdg - n & tdg - s .",
    "we compare the stellar and non - stellar ( i.e. , pah ) morphology of ngc  5291 , the `` seashell '' , and the knots next in @xmath213.2 @xmath2 3.4 .",
    "in @xmath203.5 we select a population of candidate tdgs by matching the irac seds to galaxy templates .",
    "we investigate the mid - infrared color - color and color - magnitude relations in @xmath203.6 .",
    "we estimate the tdg stellar masses in @xmath203.7 and present our conclusions in @xmath204 .",
    "we adopt a luminosity distance of 62 mpc to the ngc  5291 system .",
    "this distance is calculated using the red - shift in ned with h@xmath22 = 71 kms@xmath18mpc@xmath18 , @xmath23 = 0.27 , @xmath24 = 0.73 . & @xmath25 = 0 , and does not reflect any uncertainty in the distance due to proper motion within the group .",
    "this gives a linear scale of 1  = 0.3 kpc .",
    "irs observations were taken of both tdg - n and tdg - s .",
    "the irs low resolution data were obtained with short - low ( irs - sl ) , which operates between 5.2 and 7.7 @xmath0 m  ( irs - sl2 ) and 7.4 - 14.5 @xmath0 m ( irs - sl1 ) .",

    "see chapter 7 of the spitzer observers manual ( som ) for further observing mode and pipeline details .",
    "both tdg - n and tdg - s have extended emission at 8 @xmath0 m  with respect to the irs slits ( 3.6   irs - sl , 4.7   irs - sh and 11.1   irs - lh ) . the spectra were extracted and sky subtracted using the extended source routines in the smart analysis package ( higdon et al .",
    "the irs - sh and irs - lh date were extracted using the full aperture and the irs - sl spectra were extracted using a column of 20   fixed width .",
    "the spectra were flat - fielded and flux - calibrated by extracting and sky subtracting un - flat - fielded observations of the calibration stars hr 6348 ( irs - sl ) and ksi dra ( irs - sh , irs - lh ) , and dividing these data by the corresponding template ( cohen 2003 ) to generate a 1-dimensional relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) .",

    "the residual sky was subtracted from the irs - sl data using the off - source observations , which are part of the staring mode aor . a zodiacal light model from the spitzer planning observations tool ( spot )",

    "an aperture correction of 0.85 was applied to the irs - sl spectra as the sources are extended .",
    "in addition , the irs - lh tdg - n and tdg - s spectra were scaled by 0.30 and 0.26 , respectively in order to stitch to the irs - sh spectra .",
    "the scale factors are close to the simple geometric aperture correction for the differing irs - sh and irs - lh slits which is 0.215 .",

    "the extent of this material suggests a direct connection between ngc  5291 and the tdgs and candidates even in the absense of the hi distribution .",

    "this consists of a prominent nucleus and edge - on disk plus two structures extending above the plane , one forming an apparent ring . in non - stellar emission ,",
    "only the nucleus and edge - on disk components remain , with both much fainter than ngc  5291 .",
    "this is consistent with its lack of measured hi and line emission ( m97 ; dm98 ) . also noteworthy",

    "these templates encompass the observed range of irac seds and the closest match is used to classify each source in table 4 .",
    "for tdg - n and tdg - s we measured the near - infrared j , h and ks flux densities using a 19.5   diameter aperture on the 2mass images ( cutri et al .",

    "tdg - s shows evidence of a 1.6 @xmath0 m  `` bump '' from evolved stars , whereas the near infrared emission is flatter in tdg - n and a closer match to m  82 , which is shown as a dotted line figure 12 ( dark blue line in electronic edition ) .",
    "the near - infrared component is likely from a combined population of evolved and low - mass main sequence stars .",
    "figure 12 shows example matches for all our templates .",

    "both tdg - n and tdg - s are dominated by young stellar populations .",
    "their spectra exhibit many fine structure and molecular lines allowing us to calculate the physical properties of the star forming regions .",
    "the electron density derived from the   ratio in tdg - n is 600 @xmath97 @xmath50 .",
    "both the @xmath40   and @xmath40   ratios are higher than typical ratios measured in starburst galaxies and closer to the values measured for bcd and wolf - rayet galaxies .",
    "both metallicity and the age of a starburst effect the level of excitation .",
    "the tdgs have one - third solar metallicity and the @xmath40   line ratios are consistent with models that have the most recent epoch of star formation occurring less than five million years ago .",
    "this results in a moderately high excitation .",
    "the age of the starburst is consistent with models which predict that the young stars have formed in - situ and were not part of the parent galaxy .",
    "for the first time we have the sensitivity to measure the low j rotational lines from molecular hydrogen and thereby make a direct measurement of the warm molecular mass . assuming the gas is in lte with an ortho - to - para ratio of 3 , we derive temperatures of 460 @xmath41 75 k and 400 @xmath41 40 k , with a corresponding mass of warm gas of ( 1.0 @xmath41 0.7 ) and ( 1.5 @xmath41 0.6 ) @xmath68 m@xmath4  in tdg - n and tdg - s , respectively .",
    "this warm mass is @xmath5 0.1 % of the cold gas mass inferred from @xmath6co ( 1 - 0 ) measurements .",
    "irac observations have identified 13 additional sources within the hi ring that resemble tdg - n and tdg - s .",

    "the combined tdg and candidate tdg sample has a very narrow dispersion in @xmath7 $ ] @xmath2 @xmath9 $ ] color of @xmath1 0.7 , unlike a sample of bcds , which has a spread of @xmath1 2.5 .",

    "approximately 40 % of the knots identified in the hi ring fit the tdg template with strong pah 7.7 & 8 @xmath0 m  emission a factor @xmath1 6 times the luminosity of the cool stellar population . using their 2mass k@xmath77-band flux densities and a starburst m@xmath99l@xmath78 appropriate for their b - r colors ,",
    "we derive stellar masses of ( 1.5 @xmath41 0.6 ) and ( 3.0 @xmath41 1.0 ) @xmath11 10@xmath12 m@xmath4 for tdg - n and tdg - s respectively .",
    "these values are comparable to similarly defined stellar masses for a sample of bcds , though still only @xmath110@xmath13 of the lmc s stellar mass .",
    "adopting a mean k@xmath77 @xmath2 [ 3.6 ] color of 0.9 for the remaining candidate tdgs , we used their 3.6 @xmath0 m luminosities to derive stellar masses from 0.8 - 6.0 @xmath11 10@xmath94 m@xmath4 .",
    "the irac images of the hi ring show an incredibly rich nursery for star formation .",
    "many of the candidate tdgs have a disturbed morphology possibly resulting from previous tidal encounters with fellow companions .",
    "these are new star forming systems and may be local analogues of star formation resulting from tidal interactions in the early universe .",
