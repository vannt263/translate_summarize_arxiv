    "in contrast to hadro - production of charmonia , where the elementary production vertex is still debated , electro(photo)production of charmonia seems well understood : the @xmath3 fluctuation of the incoming real or virtual photon interacts with the target ( proton or nucleus ) via the dipole cross section @xmath4 and the result is projected on the wave function of the observed hadron . in the @xmath5 reaction",
    "only the dipole cross section @xmath4 and the wave function of the @xmath6 enter ( @xmath6 stands for @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) . in comparing calculations with experiment ( which fortunately are rather precise and cover a wide range of values @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the incoming @xmath9 ) , various parameterizations of the dipole cross section and the wave function have been successfully tested @xcite . in the exclusive electroproduction of charmonia @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ( coherent ) or @xmath12 ( incoherent , where @xmath13 is an exited state of the @xmath14-nucleon system ) new phenomena are to be expected : color filtering , i.e. inelastic interactions of the @xmath3 pair on its way through the nucleus is expected to lead to a suppression of @xmath6 production relative to @xmath15 . since the dipole cross section @xmath4 also depends on the gluon distribution in the target ( @xmath16 of @xmath14 ) , nuclear shadowing of the gluon distribution",
    "is expected to reduce @xmath4 in a nuclear reaction relative to the one on the proton .",
    "production of a @xmath3 pair in a nucleus and its absorption are also determined by the values of the coherence length @xmath17 and the formation length @xmath18 .",
    "explicit calculations have already been performed in @xcite in the approximation of a short coherence ( or production ) length , when one can treat the creation of the colorless @xmath3 pair as instantaneous , l_c =  r_a , [ 10 ] where @xmath19 is the energy of the virtual photon in the rest frame of the nucleus . at the same time",
    ", the formation length may be long , comparable with the nuclear radius @xmath20 , l_f = ~r_a  . [",
    "20 ] in @xcite the wave function formation is described by means of the light - cone green function approach summing up all possible paths of the @xmath3 in the nucleus .",
    "the result has been unexpected .",
    "contrary to naive expectation , based on the larger size of the @xmath8 compared to @xmath7 , it has been found that @xmath8 is not more strongly absorbed than the @xmath7 , but may even be enhanced by the nuclear medium .",
    "this is interpreted as an effect of filtering which is easy to understand in the limit of long coherence length , @xmath21 , when the ratio of cross sections on nuclear and nucleon targets take the simple form .",
    "indeed , the production rate of @xmath8 on a proton target is small due to strong cancellations in the projection of the produced @xmath3 wave packet onto the radial wave function of the @xmath8 which has a node .",
    "after propagation through nuclear matter the transverse size of a @xmath3 wave packet is squeezed by absorption and the projection of the @xmath8 wave function is enhanced@xcite since the effect of the node is reduced .",
    "however , the quantitative predictions of @xcite are not trustable since the calculations have been oversimplified and quite some progress has been made on the form of the dipole cross section @xmath4 and the light cone wave functions for the charmonia .",
    "therefore we take the problem up again and provide more realistic calculations for nuclear effects in exclusive electroproduction of charmonia off nuclei relying on the successful parameter free calculations which have been performed recently by the authors @xcite for elastic virtual photoproduction of charmonia , @xmath22 . since the present paper is a direct follow up of @xcite we do not repeat all definitions and notations , but rather request the reader to consult @xcite for more details .",
    "whenever one deals with high - energy reactions on nuclei , one can not avoid another problem of great importance : gluon shadowing . at small values of @xmath23 , gluon clouds overlap in longitudinal direction and may fuse . as a result , the gluon density per one nucleon in a nucleus is expected to be reduced compared to a free proton .",
    "parton shadowing , which leads to an additional nuclear suppression in various hard reactions ( dis , dy , heavy flavor , high-@xmath24 hadrons , etc . ) may be especially strong for exclusive vector meson production like charmonium production which needs at least two gluon exchange .",
    "unfortunately , we have no experimental information for gluon shadowing in nuclei so far , and we have to rely on the available theoretical estimates @xcite .    in the present paper we work in the approximation of long coherence time @xmath25 since calculations can be done with great confidence .",
    "only recently @xcite the light - cone ( lc ) dipole approach has been generalized also for the case of a finite coherence length , relevant for the vast majority of available data . however , because of technical difficulties those calculations employ the @xmath26 shape of the dipole cross section .",
    "it is still a challenge to perform calculations with a realistic dipole cross section for the regime of finite coherence length . nevertheless , we make corrections for finite values of @xmath17 employing the approximation suggested in @xcite .",
    "the predictions in this paper are meant as a realistic basis for the planning of future experiments for electron - nucleus collisions at high energies like in the erhic project .",
    "it would be highly desirable to have good data in order to test the assumptions and ingredients which have entered the calculation and which are important aspects of modern strong interaction many - body physics .",
    "furthermore , progress in the understanding of charmonium electroproduction will also have important consequences for hadroproduction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ section - nuclei ] introduces some notations and the most important definitions and expressions .",
    "then the integrated cross sections for coherent and incoherent charmonia production are calculated as function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the virtual photon and the results are presented as a ratio to @xmath14-times the cross sections on a proton . in the following two sections , two important modifications are introduced .",

    "appendix a describes some very useful calculational procedures , which considerably increase the accuracy and the speed of numerical calculations .",
    "exclusive charmonium production off nuclei , @xmath28 is called coherent , when the nucleus remains intact , i.e. @xmath11 , or incoherent , when @xmath29 is an excited nuclear state which contains nucleons and nuclear fragments but no other hadrons .",
    "the cross sections depend on the polarization @xmath30 of the virtual photon ( in all figures below we will imply @xmath31 ) , ^^*a(s , q^2 ) = ^^*_ta(s , q^2 ) + ^^*_la(s , q^2 )  , [ 30 ] where the indexes @xmath32 correspond to transversely or longitudinally polarized photons , respectively .",

    "@xmath33 is obtained by means of a lorentz boost applied the solutions of the schrdinger equation .",

    "it depends on the photon virtuality @xmath2 .",
    "one can find the details in ref .",
    "@xcite including the effects of a nonperturbative @xmath37 interaction .",
    "the cross section @xmath38 describes the interaction of a colorless quark - antiquark dipole of separation @xmath39 and c.m .",
    "energy squared @xmath1 with a nucleon . at small values of @xmath39",
    "the energy dependence should come in the combination @xmath40 in order to respect bjorken scaling .",
    "a simple parameterization of @xmath41 suggested in @xcite ( gbw ) well describes the data for @xmath42 at small @xmath23 and high @xmath2 . at low @xmath2 , however , the energy variable @xmath1 is more appropriate .",
    "a parameterization for @xmath38 suggested in @xcite ( kst ) describes dis data only up to @xmath43 which is a scale relevant for charmonia .",
    "since we can not see why one parameterization should be better than the other , we calculate results for both parameterizations as has been done in @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for coherent and incoherent production on nuclei will be derived under various conditions imposed by the coherence length eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) . at high energies",
    "the coherence length eq .   may substantially exceed the nuclear radius . in this case",
    "the transverse size of the @xmath3 wave packet is `` frozen '' by lorentz time dilation , i.e. it does not fluctuate during propagation through the nucleus , and the expressions for the cross sections , incoherent ( @xmath44 ) or coherent ( @xmath45 ) , are particularly simple @xcite , ^_t , l^*a_inc(s , q^2 ) & = & d^2bt_a(b ) ||(r_t , s ) |^t , l_c|c    ^_t , l^*a_coh(s , q^2 ) & = & d^2b||1- |^t , l_c|c |^2  .

    "[ 60 ]    as it is common practice we express nuclear cross sections for incoherent and coherent production in the form of the ratio , r_(s , q^2 ) =  , [ 70 ] where the numerator stands for the expressions eqs .   and for incoherent and coherent cross sections , respectively .",

    "we use the gbw @xcite and kst @xcite parameterizations for the dipole cross section and show the results by solid and dashed curves , respectively .",
    "differences are at most @xmath50 .    analyzing the results shown in fig",
    "[ s - inc ] , we observe that nuclear suppression of @xmath7 production becomes stronger with energy .",
    "this is an obvious consequence of the energy dependence of @xmath38 , which rises with energy ( see in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath8",
    "the suppression is rather similar as for @xmath7 .",
    "in particular we do not see any considerable nuclear enhancement of @xmath8 which has been found earlier @xcite , where the oversimplified form of the dipole cross section , @xmath51 and the oscillator form of the wave function had been used .",
    "such a form of the cross section enhances the compensation between large and small distances in the wave function of @xmath8 in the process @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the color filtering effect which emphasizes the small distance part of the wave function leads to a strong enhancement of the @xmath8 production rate .",
    "this is why using the more realistic @xmath39-dependence of @xmath53 leveling off at large @xmath39 leads to a weaker enhancement of the @xmath8 .",
    "this effect becomes even more pronounced at higher energies since the dipole cross section saturates starting at a value @xmath54 where @xmath55 decreases with energy .",
    "this observation probably explains why the @xmath8 is less enhanced at higher energies as one can see from fig .",
    "[ s - inc ] .",
    "note that the `` frozen '' approximation is valid only for @xmath25 and can be used only at @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the low - energy part of the curves depicted in fig .",
    "[ s - inc ] should be corrected for the effects related to the finiteness of @xmath17 .",
    "this will be done in section  [ section - lc ] .",
    "one can change the effect of color filtering in nuclei in a controlled way by increasing the photon virtuality @xmath2 thereby squeezing the transverse size of the @xmath3 fluctuation in the photon . for a narrower @xmath3 pair",
    "the cancellation which is caused by the node in the radial wave function of @xmath8 should be less effective .",
    "one expects that the @xmath8 to @xmath7 ratio on a proton target increases with @xmath2 , as is observed both in experiment and calculation ( fig .",
    "9 of @xcite ) .",
    "[ q - inc ] shows the result for nuclear targets : for large values of @xmath2 ratios @xmath57 and @xmath58 become very similar .",
    "this effect has also been observed in the e665 experiment @xcite for exclusive production of @xmath59 and @xmath60 off nuclei at high energies .",
    "nuclear effects for @xmath8 production shown in fig .",
    "[ q - inc ] demonstrate an even more peculiar @xmath2 dependence .",
    "the overlap of the produced @xmath3 state and the @xmath8 wave function rises with @xmath2 both in the numerator and denominator of the ratio eq .   due to the node effect .",
    "however , the nuclear filtering for large size @xmath3 pairs is especially strong at small @xmath2 , hence the @xmath2 squeezing does not affect the numerator as much as the denominator .",
    "this is why the ratio @xmath61 can be a falling function at small @xmath2 . at high @xmath2 , however , the size of the @xmath3 is so small that color filtering is not an important effect any more , while the nucleus becomes more transparent eventually causing @xmath61 to rise .",
    "cross sections for coherent production of charmonia on nuclei are calculated analogously using eq .  .",
    "the results for the energy dependence are depicted in fig .",
    "[ s - coh ] and for the @xmath2 dependence in fig .",
    "[ q - coh ] .",
    "it is not a surprise that the ratios exceed one . in the absence of @xmath3 attenuation",
    "the forward coherent production would be proportional to @xmath62 , while integrated over momentum transfer , the one depicted in fig .",
    "[ s - coh ] , behaves as @xmath63 .",
    "it is a result of our definition eq .",
    "that @xmath64 exceeds one . to avoid this artifact",
    "one may redefine the ratio for coherent processes as , r^coh_(s , q^2 ) = =  , [ 80 ] where @xmath65 is the slope of the @xmath48 differential cross section and t_a = 1ad^2bt^2_a(b ) [ 85 ] is the mean nuclear thickness .",
    "this ratio approaches one when nuclear effects disappear .",
    "nevertheless , we will follow the usual definition eq .   which is widely used for the presentation of data .",
    "we can also predict the dependence on the momentum transfer @xmath66 for the charmonium electroproduction on nuclei . in the case of incoherent production",
    "this dependence is the same as for production on free nucleons .",
    "however , in coherent production the nuclear formfactor comes into play and one has = | d^2b e^ik_tb |1-|^t , l_c|c    ( sum of @xmath67 and @xmath68 components eq .   in the form of eq .",

    "_ k_t=0 . as functions of @xmath71 at @xmath72 for different virtualities @xmath73 of the photon .",
    "we see that the @xmath71 dependences are rather similar for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the shape of the distribution is governed mainly by the nuclear geometry ( and not by the size of the ( small ) charmonium ) .",
    "the calculated curves show the familiar diffraction pattern known from elastic scattering on nuclei .",
    "the gluon density in nuclei at small bjorken @xmath23 is expected to be suppressed compared to a free nucleon due to interferences .",
    "this phenomenon called gluon shadowing renormalizes the dipole cross section , ( r_t , x ) ( r_t , x)r_g(x , q^2,b ) . [ glue ] where the factor @xmath74 is the ratio of the gluon density at @xmath23 and @xmath2 in a nucleon of a nucleus to the gluon density in a free nucleon .",
    "no data are available so far which could provide direct information about gluon shadowing .",
    "currently it can be evaluated only theoretically . in what follows",
    "we employ the technique developed in @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the phenomenon of gluon shadowing depends very much on the reference frame .",
    "it looks like glue - glue fusion in the infinite momentum frame of the nucleus : although the nucleus is lorentz contracted , the bound nucleons are still well separated since they contract too .",
    "however , the gluon clouds of the nucleons are contracted less since they have a smaller momentum fraction @xmath75 . therefore , they do overlap and interact at small @xmath23 , and gluons originating from different nucleons can fuse leading to a reduction of the gluon density .",
    "although observables must be lorentz invariant , the space - time interpretation of shadowing looks very different in the rest frame of the nucleus . here",
    "it comes as a result of eikonalization of higher fock components of the incident particles .",
    "indeed , the nuclear effect included via eikonalization into eqs .",
    "( [ 40])-([50 ] ) corresponds to the lowest @xmath3 fock component of the photon .",
    "these expressions do not include any correction for gluon shadowing , but rather correspond to shadowing of sea quarks in nuclei , analogous to what is measured in deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "although the phenomenological dipole cross section @xmath76 includes all possible effects of gluon radiation , the eikonal expressions eqs .",
    "( [ 40])-([50 ] ) assume that none of the radiated gluons takes part in multiple interaction in the nucleus .",
    "the leading order correction corresponding to gluon shadowing comes from eikonalization of the next fock component which contains the @xmath3 pair plus a gluon .",
    "one can trace on feynman graphs that this is exactly the same mechanism of gluon shadowing as glue - glue fusion in a different reference frame .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ 40])-([50 ] ) assume that for the coherence length @xmath25 .",
    "even if this condition is satisfied for a @xmath3 fluctuation , it can be broken for the @xmath77 component which is heavier .",
    "indeed , it was found in @xcite that the coherence length for gluon shadowing as about an order of magnitude shorter than the one for shadowing of sea quarks .",
    "therefore , one should not rely on the long coherence length approximation used in ( [ 40])-([50 ] ) , but take into account the finiteness of @xmath78 . this can be done by using the light - cone green function approach developed in @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath74 has the form , r_g(x , q^2,b ) = 1-  , [ 100 ] where @xmath79 is the part of the total @xmath80 cross section related to a @xmath3 fluctuation in the photon , ( ^*n ) = d^2r_t _ 0 ^ 1 d |^^*_c|c(r_t,,q^2)|^2 ( r_t , x )  .",

    ", it propagates through the whole nucleus and the mean path length is twice as long as at low energies .",
    "this is why the nuclear transparency drops when going from the regimes of short to long @xmath17",
    ".    one can simplify expression ( [ 200 ] ) assuming @xmath137 which is a rather accurate approximation for @xmath7 .",
    "then one can expand the exponentials in ( [ 220])-([230 ] ) and obtain @xcite , f^inc_(s ) =  .",
    "[ 240 ] here f_a^2(q ) = d^2b |_-^ dz _ a(b , z)e^iqz|^2 [ 260 ] is the so called longitudinal nuclear formfactor .    at low energies , @xmath138 , the formfactor @xmath139 and both the numerator and denominator in ( [ 240 ] ) decrease with energy due to the rising @xmath140 , but the denominator does it faster .",
    "this is why the ratio eq .",
    "( [ 240 ] ) rises with energy unless it drops due to the rise of the formfactor @xmath141 .",
    "the transition energy regime is related to the variation of the formfactor between 0 and 1 , i.e. at s_c|c ~m_n ( m_^2+q^2 ) r^ch_a/ = 110 s_g  .",
    "this energy increases with @xmath2 and nuclear radius in accordance with fig .",
    "[ figfi ] .",
    "note that the glauber approximation used to calculate @xmath132 is rather good for @xmath7 , but not for @xmath8 .",
    "one could improve it applying the rigorous description based on the light - cone green function formalism developed in @xcite for exclusive production of vector mesons .",
    "however , it was done only for the unrealistic form of the dipole cross sections @xmath142 and for an oscillatory wave function of the vector meson .",
    "it is still a challenge to make this approach realistic .",
    "the results for the energy dependence of the formfactor @xmath133 for coherent scattering are shown on fig .",
    "[ figfc ] . in the limit of low energies",
    "@xmath143 the strongly oscillating exponential phase factor in ( [ 210 ] ) makes the integral very small and thus @xmath144 .",
    "then the cross section rises with @xmath17 unless it saturates at @xmath25 when the phase factor becomes constant .",
    "apparently , this transition region is shifted to higher energies for larger @xmath2 and nuclear radius as is confirmed by the curves in fig .  [ figfc ] .",
    "combining the results of the previous sections ( i.e. including finite coherence length and gluon shadowing ) we obtain the final results for ratios the @xmath145 and @xmath146 . figs .",

    "[ s - coh - full ] and  [ q - coh - full ] for coherent production of charmonia .",
    "we summarize , in this paper we provide predictions for nuclear effects in exclusive electroproduction of charmonia on nuclei with realistic light - cone wave functions of charmonia and with dipole cross sections which have been already tested in a calculation of elastic charmonium electroproduction off protons .",
    "such calculations still can be performed only at rather high energies where the coherence length exceeds the nuclear size ( @xmath25 ) . at these energies gluon shadowing which is absent at lower energies ( @xmath147 ) becomes an important and sometimes the dominant effect .",
    "since no reliable experimental information about gluon shadowing is available so far , we have performed calculations of this effect employing the same light - cone dipole approach .",
    "we found sizable , but not large corrections ( 10 - 20% ) which , however , keep rising with energy .",
    "it turns out that the magnitude of gluon shadowing is suppressed by a nonperturbative interaction of the light - cone gluons which is well fixed by data on large mass diffraction .",
    "the effects related to finiteness of the coherence length at somewhat lower energies were estimated too .    we have calculated both coherent and incoherent cross sections as function of energy , @xmath2 and momentum transfer .",
    "our predictions can be tested in future experiments at high energies with electron - nuclear colliders ( erhic ) .",
    "it also can be produced in peripheral heavy ion collisions ( rhic , lhc ) , and our predictions will be published elsewhere .    * acknowledgment * : the authors gratefully acknowledge the partial support by a grant from the gesellschaft fr",

    "matrix elements of the dipole cross section @xmath4 for the charmonia production including the effects of spin rotation were calculated in @xcite for the specific form of the @xmath39 dependence provided by the kst and gbw parameterizations : [ dipole - rt ] _",
    "q|q(r_t ) = _ 0 .    in the nuclear case one needs to calculate matrix elements of the operators with @xmath148 in the exponent .",

    "so matrix elements of powers @xmath150 have to be calculated .",

    "the rate of convergence of such series slows down with increasing @xmath156 ( larger @xmath1 ) and increasing nuclear thickness ( @xmath157 ) . in our calculations we used a more efficient expansion , which contains matrix elements @xmath153 in the exponent .",
    "this form can be obtained when applying the identity 1+x = e^(1+x ) = ( x-2 + 3 + ) to ( with @xmath158 ) and ( with @xmath159 ) . as a result",

    "[ figresum ] shows that while one needs about six terms ( @xmath160 ) to obtain an accurate result using taylor expansion , one has already satisfactory results for @xmath161 in the method , where one resums in the exponent .",
