    "<S> we investigate the ground - state properties of the one - dimensional two - band hubbard model with different bandwidths . </S>",

    "<S> the resultant kugel - khomskii spin - orbital model includes a @xmath3 field coupled to orbital pseudo - spins . </S>",
    "<S> this field originates from the discrepancy between the two bandwidths and leads to a finite orbital pseudo - spin magnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> `` orbital degrees of freedom '' has been one of the important keywords to understand the low temperature properties of strongly correlated electron systems . among them , recently , the orbital - selective mott transition ( osmt ) is proposed to explain the exotic heavy metallic state in ca@xmath4sr@xmath5ruo@xmath6@xcite . to illustrate this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the two - orbital model with different bandwidths has been extensively investigated by dynamical mean - field theory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have clarified the realization conditions of the osmt by changing various parameters , such as coulomb interaction parameters , band structures , band filling , and others . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we also study the ground state properties of the two - band hubbard model with different bandwidths , but in one dimension ( 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> our main concern here is whether the osmt survives in 1d , where the effect of quantum fluctuations is most severely enhanced .    </S>",
    "<S> first , let us begin with the description of the 1d two - orbital hubbard model@xcite defined by ; @xmath7 where @xmath8 creates an electron with spin @xmath9 ( = @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) and orbital @xmath12 (= 1 or 2 ) at the @xmath13-th site . </S>",
    "<S> the electron transfers of strength @xmath14 are possible between the same type of neighboring orbitals and @xmath1 denotes the chemical potential . as for the intra - site coulomb interactions , we assume the rotational invariance for simplicity , and thus the coulomb parameters , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , always hold the following relation ; @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the intra - atomic coulomb interactions are concerned , physically relevant parameters would satisfy @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not restrict our calculations to this parameter region , since in general the above hamiltonian can be also viewed as a variation of coupled hubbard chains .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we have used the infinite - size density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm@xcite modified by adapting the recursion relation to the wave function , namely , the wave function is so upgraded that it should gradually approach the ground - state wave function when the system size is extended . </S>",
    "<S> this technique , called the product - wave - function renormalization - group method@xcite , enhances the accuracy of calculations and overcomes metastability problems during the renormalizing process if the ground state to target is gapless .    , denoted by open circles ) , </S>",
    "<S> orbital 2 ( @xmath20 , solid triangles ) and their sum ( @xmath21 , open squares ) as a function of chemical potential @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> coulomb interactions are set to be @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24.,width=264 ]     and @xmath20 ( upper panel ) , and the nearest neighbor spin - spin and orbital - orbital correlation functions ( lower panel ) as a function of @xmath16 , where @xmath25 , @xmath22 and @xmath18 holds.,width=264 ]    the different bandwidths are implemented in eq.([dege - hub ] ) by taking @xmath26 and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> since we are mainly interested in strongly correlated regime , @xmath15 is always fixed at 10 throughout this paper and @xmath16 as well as @xmath17 are varied while keeping @xmath18 . by means of the dmrg technique , we have calculated the electron density of @xmath28-orbital defined by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the total number of sites . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath31 , @xmath20 , and @xmath32 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> let us take a closer look at fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] from the low chemical potential region . when @xmath1 exceeds @xmath33 , the bottom of the orbital-1 energy band , @xmath31 increases sharply while @xmath20 stays zero until @xmath1 reaches @xmath34 . at @xmath34 , @xmath31 and @xmath20 , respectively , drops down and jumps up suddenly . </S>",
    "<S> then between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath31 ( @xmath20 ) shows a gradual ( steep ) monotonic increase and , finally , the first plateaux for both @xmath31 and @xmath20 appear simultaneously between @xmath35 and @xmath36 . at these plateaux , </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath31 and @xmath20 are irrational but @xmath21 definitely equals to unity corresponding to one - quarter filling . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this mott insulating state itself is not controversial except for that @xmath31 is not equal to @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we will come back to this point later . </S>",
    "<S> with further increase of @xmath1 above @xmath36 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] , we find the next plateau at @xmath37 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which means the charge gap opens for the orbital-2 band . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , @xmath31 increases continuously toward unity in this region and thus the orbital-1 band should be metallic . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the filling - control osmt takes place at @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the orbital - selective mott state with one orbital localized and the other itinerant is realized just below one - half filling in the present system . for @xmath40 , the @xmath41 plateau emerges in addition to the @xmath37 plateau , which correspond to the normal half - filled mott insulating state .    </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , we will investigate the quarter - filled mott state in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , the dmrg calculations are performed within the @xmath42 subspace at quarter filling . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f2 ] shown are the electron densities ( @xmath31 and @xmath20 , upper panel ) and correlation functions ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 , lower panel ) as a function of @xmath16 for @xmath22 and @xmath45 . considering the atomic limit , there are three possible ground states characterized by ; i ) spin - triplet and orbital - singlet states like @xmath46 ( averaged site energy @xmath47 ) , ii ) singly occupied states like @xmath48 ( null site energy ) , and iii ) spin - singlet and orbital - triplet states like @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , two quantum critical points , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , separate the above three phases when @xmath53 . the singularity around @xmath54 in fig . [ f2 ] seems to correspond to @xmath55 and , in fact , the vanishing orbital polarization below @xmath56 is consistent with the formation of a local orbital singlet . with further increase of @xmath16 above @xmath55 , an orbital magnetization : @xmath57 develops accompanied by the antiferromagnetic spin - spin and the ferromagnetic orbital - orbital correlations . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that , at the one - quarter plateau , the magnitude of charge disproportionation between @xmath31 and @xmath20 depends on coulomb interaction parameters and only the total electron density is preserved . for @xmath58 , @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> is saturated and all electrons reside in the orbital 1 . in such a strong - coupling regime , </S>",
    "<S> the system should be identical to the isotropic heisenberg spin chain , which is confirmed by @xmath60 as well as @xmath61 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f2 ] .    in order to examine </S>",
    "<S> how the orbital polarization at quarter filling is developed with increasing @xmath16 , we have derived the effective spin - orbital hamiltonian of kugel - khomskii type@xcite . </S>",
