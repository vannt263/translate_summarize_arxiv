    "nanomechanical oscillators have recently attracted considerable attention for their possible applications in quantum information and quantum measurement ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "a nanomechanical oscillator is also a promising device for studying macroscopic quantum effects in mechanical systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . using current experimental techniques  ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , high - frequency nanomechanical oscillators ( @xmath0 ghz ) with quality factors @xmath1 in the range of @xmath2@xmath3 can be realized at low temperatures @xmath4 on the order of mk . when the vibrational energy @xmath5 of the nanomechanical oscillator becomes smaller than the thermal energy @xmath6",
    ", the oscillator can be said to work in the quantum regime .    to observe quantum behavior in nanomechanical oscillators , e.g. , quantum fluctuations or squeezing effects , the oscillator must be cooled to extremely low temperatures to approach the standard quantum limit",
    ". there have been numerous studies , both theoretical and experimental ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , investigating the cooling of the fluctuations of nanomechanical oscillators . many of these studies focus on optomechanical systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where an oscillating cantilever or an oscillating micro - mirror is modelled as a harmonic oscillator .",
    "there are two approaches in optomechanical cooling : passive cooling  @xcite and active cooling  @xcite . in passive cooling techniques ,",
    "the mechanical oscillator is self - cooled by the dynamical back - action , e.g. , the radiation - pressure - induced back - action  @xcite coming from the mirror surface of the optical cavity .",
    "in fact , for a high - finesse cavity , the photons reflected from the mirror of the cavity transfer momentum and induce additional damping to the mechanical oscillator . in active cooling techniques , the reflected signal coming from the mechanical oscillator is sent to an electronic circuit , e.g. , a derivative circuit , to provide a modulating signal , which is then used to control the back - action force imposed on the mechanical oscillator . since the cooling effect can be actively controlled by tuning the feedback gain obtained in the control circuit , this",
    "is called an active cooling strategy .    although it has recently been reported that ground - state cooling  @xcite could be realized in optomechanical systems , it is difficult to observe the macroscopic quantum effects of the mechanical oscillators in these optomechanical systems using current experimental conditions .",
    "the main difficulty comes from the fact that the characteristic oscillating frequency of the mechanical oscillator in these systems is not high enough ( typically on the order of khz or mhz ) , and the corresponding effective temperature to observe the quantum effects is extremely low ( typically on the order of nk or @xmath7k ) , which is difficult to realize in present - day experiments .",
    "besides optomechanical cooling , a nanomechanical oscillator can also be embedded in an electronic circuit and cooled by coupling it to an electronic system  @xcite .",
    "possible strategies include nanomechanical oscillators coupled to superconducting single - electron transistors  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite , josephson - junction superconducting circuits  @xcite , or transmission line resonators  @xcite . compared with mechanical oscillators in optical systems",
    ", a high - frequency oscillator can be realized more easily in electronic systems .",
    "indeed , it has been reported that nanomechanical beams  @xcite with frequencies in the regime of ghz have been realized , and these beams seem to be suitable for integration in an electronic circuit .",
    "since the effective temperature of such a mechanical oscillator can be in the mk regime , it should be possible to observe quantum behavior in this case .    like optomechanical systems",
    ", active feedback controls can be introduced to cool the motions of the nanomechanical oscillators in electronic systems . in the theoretical proposal in ref .",
    "@xcite , a nanomechanical resonator is capacitively coupled to a single - electron transistor to measure the position of the resonator .",
    "the information obtained by the quantum measurement is fed into a feedback circuit to obtain an output control signal , which is then imposed on a feedback electrode to control the motion of the resonator . in this strategy ,",
    "the quantum measurement and the designed feedback control introduce additional damping effects on the resonator , which are helpful for cooling the motion of the resonator .    in a recent experiment  @xcite ,",
    "a nanomechanical beam acted as one side of a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , and the voltage across the squid was measured which can be used to detect the motion of the beam .",
    "motivated by this experiment , here we study the coupling between such a system  @xcite and a transmission line resonator . a single - mode quantized electromagnetic field provided by this resonator  @xcite could be detected by a homodyne measurement  @xcite .",
    "the quantization of this coupled beam  squid  resonator system has been addressed in the literature ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and theoretical analysis shows that such a device can be used to detect the motion of the beam  @xcite . here , we would like to concentrate on a different problem : how to design a quantum feedback control from the output signal of the homodyne detection to drive the motion of the beam ?",
    "different from previous work , such as the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantum feedback control proposed here is _",
    "imposed on the transmission line resonator , not on the beam , _ and indirectly controls the motion of the nanomechanical beam via the coupling between the transmission line resonator and the beam . by adiabatically eliminating the degrees of freedom of the squid and the transmission line resonator",
    ", the designed feedback control could introduce anharmonic terms in the effective hamiltonian and additional damping terms for the nanomechanical beam , _ leading to both cooling and squeezing _ of the fluctuations of the beam .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [ s2 ] , we present a coupled system composed of : ( i ) a transmission line resonator , ( ii ) an rf - squid , and ( iii ) a nanomechanical beam . the open quantum system model and the quantum weak measurement approach used to design the feedback control are investigated in sec .",
    "the quantum feedback control design is presented in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , and our main results about squeezing and cooling the fluctuations of the beam are discussed in sec .",
    "the conclusion and discussion of possible future work are presented in sec .",
    "we mainly focus on a physical model in which a doubly - clamped nanomechanical beam , a rf - squid , and a transmission line resonator are inductively coupled ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the quantum electromechanical circuit and the corresponding equivalent schematic diagram are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig of the coupled transmission line - squid - nanomechanical beam system ] . in this circuit , the mechanical oscillator ,",
    "i.e. , the clamped nanomechanical beam , is integrated into the rf - squid with a josephson junction having a critical current @xmath8 and a capacitance @xmath9 . here",
    ", the displacement of the beam in the plane of the loop with a small amplitude @xmath10 around its equilibrium position changes the area of the loop , and thus influences the total magnetic flux @xmath11 threading the loop .",
    "there is an applied external flux @xmath12 threading the loop . the rf - squid interacts with a nearby transmission line resonator ( tlr ) , via their mutual inductance .",
    "the additional magnetic flux provided by the quantized current in the transmission line resonator is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the annihilation and creation operators of the quantized electromagnetic field in the transmission line resonator . here",
    ", we ignore the small change of @xmath14 caused by the oscillation of the beam .",
    "for this superconducting circuit , the total magnetic flux @xmath11 threading the loop of the rf - squid is given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are , respectively , the self - inductance and the current in the loop ; @xmath20 is the effective length of the beam ; and @xmath21 is the magnetic field threading the loop of the rf - squid at the location of the nanomechanical beam , and is assumed to be constant in the region where the beam oscillates .",

    "( [ hamiltonian of the coupled resonator - squid - beam system ] ) are given by : @xmath33 the observables @xmath34 and @xmath35 in eqs .",
    "( [ h_0 ] ) and ( [ h_1 ] ) are , respectively , the conjugate observables of @xmath10 and @xmath11 representing the momentum of the beam and the charge on the josephson junction . the term @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ h_0 ] ) is an interaction hamiltonian between the transmission line resonator and the external control field , where the time - dependent function @xmath37 can be designed according to the desired goal .    when @xmath38 and @xmath39 the hamiltonian @xmath40 represents a double - well potential near @xmath41 , and the two lowest eigenstates , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , correspond to two current states with opposite circulating currents in the loop of the rf - squid , which are far separated from higher - energy eigenstates . at sufficiently low temperatures , only the two lowest eigenstates @xmath42 , @xmath43 contribute .",
    "thus , the rf - squid can be modelled as a two - level system , and the hamiltonian @xmath40 of the rf - squid can be re - expressed as  @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the @xmath10-axis and @xmath47-axis pauli operators in the basis of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; @xmath48 , @xmath49 are real parameters that determine the energy difference between the two minima of the double - well potential and the tunnelling amplitude between the wells , respectively . under the condition",
    "that @xmath50 then @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be approximately given by @xcite : @xmath51    letting the external flux @xmath52 , we can rewrite the hamiltonian @xmath40 in the qubit basis as : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , @xmath56 are the corresponding @xmath10-axis and @xmath47-axis pauli operators in the qubit basis : latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath241 .    with the same analysis , we can calculate @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 , and @xmath245 . furthermore , under the condition that @xmath246 , we have @xmath247 .",
    "thus , by substituting the above results into eq .",
    "( [ differential equation form of the heisenberg equation of x ] ) , averaging over the fluctuations caused by the thermal noises , and assuming that @xmath248 we can obtain the quantum stochastic differential equation ( [ quantum stochastic differential equation of the coupled resonator - squid - beam system ] ) .    in order to calculate the measurement output of the homodyne detection , let us recall that the input and output detection noises should be @xmath249 where the time @xmath250 is an instant before the measurement commences , and the time @xmath251 is another instant after the measurement has finished .",
    "the measurement output is related to @xmath252 by : @xmath253 where @xmath254 is an adjustable phase introduced by the local oscillator of the homodyne detection . from eq .",

    "under the semiclassical approximation , we can obtain maxwell - bloch - type equations from the stochastic master equation ( [ stochastic master equation for the beam and the transmission line resonator ] ) for the coupled beam - squid - resonator system ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "further , in the large - detuning regime ( see eq .",
    "( [ large detuning assumption ] ) ) , we have @xmath260 where @xmath261 then , we can omit the frequency shifts of the beam , the rf - squid , and the transmission line resonator induced by the coupling between them . under this condition , the maxwell - bloch - type equations for the coupled system obtained from the stochastic master equation ( [ stochastic master equation for the beam and the transmission line resonator ] ) can be expressed as : @xmath262 where @xmath189 has been given in eq .",
