    "the theoretical model based on the vacuum polarization processes @xcite occurring in a kerr - newman geometry @xcite can indeed explain such enormous energetics and the sharp time variability .",
    "what is most important is that such a model is based on explicit analytic solutions of well - tested ultrarelativistic field theories .",
    "the formation of such black holes in a process of gravitational collapse is expected from a large variety of binary mergers composed of neutron stars , white dwarfs and massive stars at the end point of their thermonuclear evolution @xcite in all possible combinations .    in particular , in the merging of two neutron stars and in the final process of gravitational collapse to a black hole",
    "is expected the occurrence of electromagnetic fields with strength larger than the critical value of vacuum polarization @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the electron mass and charge respectively @xcite .",
    "we are currently reexamining the electrodynamical processes of a neutron star via an ultrarelativistic thomas - fermi equation to identify the possible physical origin of this overcritical electric field @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the gravitational collapse ( occurring on characteristic gravitational time scales @xmath7 s ) and the associated electrodynamical process are too complex for a direct description . we address here a more confined problem : the polarization process around an already formed kerr - newman black hole .",
    "this is a well defined theoretical problem which deserves attention .",
    "it represents a physical state asymptotically reachable in the process of gravitational collapse .",
    "we expect such an asymptotic configuration be reached when all the multipoles departing from the kerr - newman geometry have been radiated away either by process of vacuum polarization or electromagnetic and gravitational waves . what it is most important is that by performing this theoretical analysis we can gain a direct evaluation of the energetics of the spectra and dynamics of the @xmath0 plasma created on the extremely short time scales due to the quantum phenomena of @xmath8 s. this entire transient phenomena , starting from an initial neutral condition , undergoes the formation of the kerr - newman black hole by the collective effects of gravitation , strong , weak , electromagnetic interactions during a fraction of the above mentioned gravitational characteristic time scale of collapse .    the aim of this article is to explore the initial condition for such a process to occur using the recently introduced concept of `` dyadotorus '' @xcite which generalizes to the kerr - newman geometry the concept of the `` dyadosphere '' previously introduced in the case of the spherically symmetric reissner - nordstrm geometry @xcite .",

    "we investigate in section iii how the presence of rotation in spacetime modifies the shape of the surface containing the region where electron - positron pairs are created . due to the axial symmetry we call that region as dyadotorus and we give the conditions for its existence .",
    "we then provide some pictorial representations of the boundary surface of the dyadotorus by using the boyer - lindquist radial and angular coordinates as polar coordinates in flat space as well as by employing kerr - schild coordinates .",
    "we show in section iv the dyadotorus on the corresponding embedding diagrams , which reveal the intrinsic structure of the spacetime geometry . in section",
    "v we provide an estimate of the electromagnetic energy contained in the dyadotorus by using three different definitions commonly adopted in the literature , i.e. the standard definition in terms of the timelike killing vector ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the one recently suggested by katz , lynden - bell and bik @xcite for axially symmetric asymptotically flat spacetimes , which is an observer dependent definition of energy , and the last one involving the theory of pseudotensors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all these approaches are shown to give the same results .",
    "finally , a comparison is made between the electromagnetic energy of an extreme kerr - newman black hole and the corresponding one of a reissner - nordstrm black hole with the same total mass and charge to mass ratio .",
    "in addition to the topological differences between the dyadotorus and the dyadosphere , it is shown how larger field strengths are allowed in the case of a kerr - newman geometry close to the horizon , when compared with a reissner - nordstrm black hole of the same mass energy and charge to mass ratio .",
