    "this means we first pick @xmath6 and then remove each edge with probability @xmath9 , independently of the other edges .",
    "we obtain a partition of vertices into clusters , i.e. connected components , and we are concerned with the asymptotic sizes of these clusters .",
    "let us call percolation on a rrt @xmath6 in the regime @xmath10    * _ weakly supercritical _",
    ", if @xmath11 , * _ supercritical _ , if @xmath12 for some @xmath13 fixed , * _ strongly supercritical _ , if @xmath14 .",
    "the terminology is explained by our results : we will see that the root cluster has size @xmath15 , while the next largest clusters have a size of order @xmath16 .",
    "we encode the sizes of all percolation clusters by a tree structure , which we call the _ tree of cluster sizes_. a percolation cluster of @xmath6 is called a cluster of generation @xmath17 , if it is disconnected from the root cluster by exactly @xmath17 deleted edges . in the tree of cluster sizes , vertices of level @xmath17 are labeled by the sizes of the clusters of generation @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , the root vertex represents the size of the root cluster of @xmath6 .",
    "then , if a vertex represents the size of a cluster @xmath18 of generation @xmath17 , its children are given by the sizes of those clusters of generation @xmath19 which are separated from @xmath18 by one deleted edge ( see figure @xmath2 ) .",
    "we normalize cluster sizes of generation @xmath17 by a factor @xmath20 . after a local re - ranking of vertices , we show that the tree of cluster sizes converges in distribution to the genealogical tree of a continuous - state branching process ( csbp ) in discrete time , with reproduction measure @xmath21 on @xmath22 and started from a single particle of size @xmath2 ( theorem [ t1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we obtain precise limits for the largest non - root clusters ( corollary [ c1 ] ) .",
    "asymptotic cluster sizes have been studied for numerous other random graph models . at first place , these include the erds - rnyi graph model ( see alon and spencer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11 ) for an overview with further references ) . concerning trees , uniform cayley trees of size @xmath0",
    "have been studied in the works of pitman @xcite , @xcite and pavlov @xcite in the regime @xmath23 , @xmath13 fixed , where the number of giant components is unbounded . for general large trees , bertoin gives in @xcite a criterion for the root cluster of a bernoulli bond percolation to be the ( unique ) giant cluster .    unlike random cayley trees of size @xmath0 , whose heights are typically of order @xmath24 , random recursive trees have heights of logarithmic order ( see e.g. the book of drmota @xcite ) .",
    "bertoin proved in @xcite that in the supercritical regime when @xmath25 , the size of the root cluster of a rrt on @xmath4 vertices , normalized by a factor @xmath26 , converges to @xmath27 in probability , while the sizes of the next largest clusters , normalized by a factor @xmath28 , converge to the atoms of some poisson random measure .",
    "this result was extended by bertoin and bravo @xcite to large scale - free random trees , which grow according to a preferential attachment algorithm and form another family of trees with logarithmic height .",
    "here we follow the route of @xcite and analyze a system of branching processes with rare neutral mutations . in this way we gain control over the sizes of the root cluster and of the largest clusters of the first generation , for all regimes @xmath10 .",
    "an iteration of the arguments then allows us to prove convergence of higher generation cluster sizes .",
    "the methods of @xcite are based on a coupling of iksanov and mhle @xcite between the process of isolating the root in a rrt and a certain random walk .",
    "they seem less suitable for the weakly supercritical regime , where one has to look beyond the passage time up to which the coupling is valid .",
    "this was already mentioned in the introduction of @xcite , where also the question is raised how the sizes of the largest clusters behave when @xmath29 .    in the second part of this paper , we however readopt the methods of @xcite .",
    "we consider a destruction process on @xmath6 , where edges are equipped with i.i.d .",
    "exponential clocks and deleted at the time given by the corresponding variable . starting with the full tree @xmath6 , each removal of an edge @xmath30 gives birth to a new tree component rooted at the outer endpoint of @xmath30 .",
    "the order in which the tree components are cut suggests an encoding of their sizes and birth times by a tree - indexed process , which we call the _ tree of components _ ( see figure @xmath31 for an example ) .",
    "keeping track of the birth times allows us to consider only those tree components which are born in the destruction process up to a certain finite time . interpreting the latter as a version of a bernoulli bond percolation on @xmath6 , tree components are naturally related to percolation clusters .",
    "this observation was made by bertoin in @xcite and then used to study cluster sizes in the supercritical regime .",
    "we further develop these ideas in the last section and make the link to our results on percolation from the first part of this paper .",
    "the starting point is a limit result for the tree of components ( theorem [ t2 ] ) , which we believe is of interest on its own .",
    "the destruction process can be viewed as an iterative application of the cutting down or isolation of the root process , which has been analyzed in detail for rrt s in meir and moon @xcite , panholzer , drmota _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , iksanov and mhle @xcite , bertoin @xcite and others .",
    "the tree of components should be seen as a complement to the so - called _ cut - tree _ , which was studied for random recursive trees by bertoin in  @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall its definition at the very end .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the goal of section [ streeofclustersizes ] is to prove our main result theorem [ t1 ] on the sizes of percolation clusters .",
    "we first introduce the tree of cluster sizes and state the theorem .",
    "then we establish the connection to yule processes and obtain the asymptotic sizes of the root and first generation clusters .",
    "we then turn to higher generation clusters in the tree and finish the proof of theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "section [ streeofcomponents ] is devoted to the analysis of the destruction process of a rrt .",
    "at first we define the tree of components and formulate our main result theorem [ t2 ] for this tree .",
    "the splitting property of random recursive trees transfers into a branching property for the tree of components , which we illustrate together with the coupling of iksanov and mhle in the next part . then we prove theorem [ t2 ] .",
    "in the last part , we sketch how our analysis of the destruction process leads to information on percolation clusters in the supercritical regime .",
    "we compare our results there with theorem [ t1 ] and finish this paper by pointing at the connection to the cut - tree .",
    "we finally mention that except for the very last part , section [ streeofcomponents ] on the destruction process can be read independently of section [ streeofclustersizes ] .",
    "we use a tree structure to store the percolation clusters or , more precisely , their sizes . in this direction , recall that the universal tree is given by @xmath32 with the convention @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in particular , an element @xmath35 is a finite sequence of strictly positive integers @xmath36 , and we refer to its length @xmath37 as the `` generation '' or level of @xmath38 .",

    "this means that exactly @xmath17 edges have been removed by the percolation from the path in the original tree @xmath6 connecting @xmath7 to the root of the cluster . in this terminology ,",
    "the only cluster of the zeroth generation is the root cluster .",
    "we define recursively a process @xmath46 indexed by the universal tree , which we call the _ tree of cluster sizes_.    first , @xmath47 is the size of the root cluster of @xmath6 .",
    "next , we let @xmath48 denote the decreasingly ranked sequence of the sizes of the clusters of generation @xmath2 , where @xmath49 , and in the case of ties , clusters of the same size are ordered uniformly at random .",
    "we continue the definition iteratively as follows .",
    "assume that for some @xmath35 with @xmath50 , @xmath51 has already been defined to be the size of some cluster @xmath52 of generation @xmath53 .",

    "an example is given in figure @xmath2 .",

    "we turn now to the statement of theorem [ t1 ] . recall that we consider the regimes @xmath70 with @xmath10 as @xmath71 . in the strongly supercritical regime",

    "we will develop the methods that enable us to prove finite - dimensional convergence of the tree of cluster sizes for generations @xmath85 .",
    "we conclude this part with the proof of corollary [ c1 ] . in the next section ,",
    "we lift the convergence to higher levels in the tree and thereby finish the proof theorem [ t1 ] .",

    "then , if the ancestor is labeled by @xmath7 and the next individuals are labeled in the increasing order of their birth times , the genealogical tree of the yule process stopped at the instant @xmath88 is a version of @xmath6 .    with this construction , percolation on a rrt @xmath6 with parameter @xmath89 can be interpreted in terms of neutral mutations which are superposed to the genealogical tree . in the description that follows",
    "we are guided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "except for the ancestor , we let each individual of the yule process be a clone of its parent with probability @xmath90 and a mutant with probability @xmath91 . being",
    "a mutant means that the individual receives a new genetic type which was not present before .",

    "the recursive structure of @xmath6 allows us to transfer the arguments of the foregoing section to higher generation clusters .",
    "we however need some preparation .",
    "let @xmath6 be a rrt on @xmath5 , as usual . here",
    "it will be convenient to label the edges of @xmath6 by their outer endpoints , i.e. the edge @xmath30 joining vertex @xmath175 to vertex @xmath39 , where @xmath107 , is labeled @xmath39 .",
    "we then say that @xmath30 is the @xmath39th edge of @xmath6 .",
    "we incorporate bernoulli bond percolation on @xmath6 , but instead of deleting edges , we simply mark them with probability @xmath91 each , independently of each other .",

    ", if it contains only unmarked edges and is maximal in the sense that no further edges without marks can be attached to it .",
    "in other words , the intact subtrees of @xmath6 are precisely the percolation clusters of @xmath6 .",
    "we again view @xmath6 as the genealogical tree of a standard yule process stopped at the instant when the @xmath249th individual is born .",
    "henceforth we will identify vertices with individuals , i.e. we will make no difference between the vertex labeled @xmath39 and the @xmath39th individual of the population system .",
    "the marked edges indicate a birth event of a mutant .",
    "this means that if the @xmath39th edge is a marked edge , then the @xmath39th individual is a mutant , and the vertices of the intact subtree rooted at @xmath39 correspond to the individuals bearing the same genetic type as the @xmath39th individual .",
    "moreover , the genetic type @xmath35 of the @xmath39th individual can be derived from the subtree of @xmath6 spanned by the vertices @xmath250 and from the marks on its edges .",
    "our description shows that we may generate the subpopulation sizes @xmath103 , @xmath251 , by first picking a rrt @xmath6 , then marking each edge with probability @xmath91 , independently of each other , and then defining @xmath103 to be the size of the intact subtree of @xmath6 rooted at the mutant of type @xmath38 .",
    "let us write @xmath252 for the full genealogical ( sub)tree which stems from the mutant of type @xmath38 .",

    "we next observe that conditionally on its size @xmath264 and upon the canonical relabeling of its vertices , @xmath265 is itself distributed as a rrt on @xmath263 . indeed , as we pointed out above , in order to decide whether a given vertex @xmath39 of @xmath6 is the root of the subtree encoded by @xmath265 , we have to look only at the subtree ( with its marks ) spanned by the vertices @xmath266 . in particular , the structure of the subtree stemming from @xmath39 is irrelevant .",
    "if we condition on @xmath264 and perform the canonical relabeling of vertices , the recursive construction then implies that each increasing arrangement of the vertices @xmath267 is equally likely , that is to say @xmath265 is a random recursive tree .",
    "moreover , if @xmath268 do not lie on the same infinite branch of @xmath269 emerging from the root @xmath42 , then @xmath265 and @xmath270 are conditionally on their sizes independent rrt s , since their vertex sets are disjoint .",
    "we remark that these properties of random recursive trees are closely related to the so - called _ splitting property _ , which plays a major role in our analysis of the destruction process of a rrt in section [ streeofcomponents ] .",

    "in fact , each such percolation cluster of @xmath6 can be identified with a subtree of a tree component rooted at the same vertex , meaning that within its surrounding component , the percolation cluster forms the root cluster .",
    "the usefulness of this point of view comes from two facts .",
    "firstly , we know from the second part of lemma [ l5 ] that in the regime , the root cluster of a rrt @xmath310 has size @xmath504 as @xmath469 . secondly , the asymptotic sizes of the tree components can be specified ( see proposition [ p2 ] ) . in order to reveal the inner root percolation cluster inside a tree component ,",
    "the latter has to be `` unfrozen '' , i.e. some additional edges have to be erased .",
    "this approach was used by bertoin @xcite to study the sizes of the root percolation clusters inside the tree components of the first generation , and our aim is to outline how these ideas can be extended to all clusters .",
    "we first lift the convergence of lemma [ l5 ] to higher generations . towards this end , let @xmath505 then we can use lemma [ l5 ] instead of proposition [ p1 ] to obtain a limit result for the ranked version @xmath506 . here , by a small abuse of notation , @xmath507 is a random bijection that sorts the children of each element @xmath508 in the decreasing order of their first coordinate , keeping the parent - child relation . the limit process @xmath509 is obtained from @xmath510 by first removing those pairs @xmath511 with @xmath383 and then by a relabeling of the remaining elements .",
    "alternatively , in accordance with lemma [ l5 ] , the law of the limit can also be specified as follows .    1 .",
    "@xmath512 almost surely ; 2 .   for every @xmath66 conditionally on @xmath513 , the sequences @xmath514 for the vertices @xmath35 at generation @xmath37",
    "are independent , and each sequence @xmath515 is distributed as the family of the atoms of a poisson random measure on @xmath516 with intensity @xmath517 , ranked in the decreasing order of the first coordinate .",
    "now the tree components have to be unfrozen to observe the percolation clusters inside .",
    "write @xmath252 for the tree component whose size and birth time is stored in @xmath519 ( with @xmath254 if there is no such component , and @xmath520 ) .",
    "say we want to determine the size of the root percolation cluster inside the tree component @xmath252 .",
    "this component was cut off from a bigger subtree at time @xmath521 . by the memoryless property of exponential variables ,",
    "we are therefore lead to perform a bernoulli bond percolation on @xmath252 with parameter @xmath522 , and adapting the arguments of @xcite , we deduce that the root cluster @xmath55 of @xmath252 has size @xmath523 more generally , denote by @xmath55 for @xmath35 the percolation cluster with the same root as @xmath252 ( under our coupling with the destruction process ) . in the percolation regime @xmath25",
    ", we have @xmath524 using proposition [ p2 ] , the last two displays and similar arguments as in the proof of theorem [ t2 ] , we obtain the following limit result for the cluster sizes @xmath525 .      extending the arguments of (",
    "* lemma 6 , 7 ) to higher levels in the tree , we moreover see that corollary [ c2 ] remains true if we apply our usual ranking operation to both sides .",
    "denote by @xmath527 the ranked version of @xmath528 , i.e. @xmath529 , where @xmath530 is a random bijection sorting the children @xmath531 of each element @xmath525 in the decreasing order , such that the parent - child relation is preserved .",
    "for the right hand side , let us write @xmath532 and @xmath533 for the ranked version of @xmath534 .",
    "then the convergence in corollary [ c2 ] transfers to the ranked versions , i.e. @xmath535 in the sense of finite - dimensional distributions in the regime .",
    "it is now instructive to compare this last convergence result with theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "we first remark that as for the tree of cluster sizes @xmath61 from section [ smainresults ] , the process @xmath536 stores the size of every percolation cluster of @xmath6 . both @xmath78 and @xmath537",
    "encode the size of the cluster containing @xmath7 .",
    "but besides that , the two encodings are different . most importantly , if we look at some specific percolation cluster of @xmath6 and ask for the vertex @xmath35 to which the size of this cluster is attached in the process",
    "@xmath538 , we observe that its level @xmath37 does not merely depend on the total number of removed edges which separate the cluster from the vertex @xmath7 , but also on the order in which these edges were removed",
    ".    to stress the difference in the encodings , call a percolation cluster encoded by some @xmath55 with @xmath37 a cluster of rank @xmath17 . in terms of our classification of clusters into generations from section [ smainresults ] , a cluster of generation @xmath376 with root node @xmath539 can be a cluster of rank @xmath540 ; the rank depends on the order in which the @xmath17 erased edges on the path from @xmath7 to @xmath539 were removed in the destruction process .",
    "conversely , a cluster of rank @xmath80 with root node @xmath539 can be a cluster of generation @xmath17 for @xmath541dist@xmath542 , where dist@xmath543 denotes the graph distance on @xmath6 before the percolation was performed .",
    "figure @xmath322 illustrates the difference in the encoding by @xmath61 and @xmath544 , respectively .",
    "we tacitly assume that the tree of cluster sizes @xmath61 is defined in terms of the final state of a percolation on @xmath6 which is used to define @xmath544 .",
    "for example , the cluster @xmath545 is a cluster of rank @xmath2 , since the edge joining @xmath546 to its parent @xmath322 was the first edge from the path connecting @xmath7 to @xmath546 which was removed in the destruction process . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath545 is a cluster of generation @xmath31 , since it is disconnected from @xmath7 by two deleted edges in the final outcome of percolation .",
    "+ _ middle : the cluster encoding by @xmath544 .",
    "note that several orderings of edge removals give rise to the same tree .",
    "_ + _ right : the tree of cluster sizes @xmath61 defined in section [ smainresults ] .",
    "_    recall the description of @xmath547 from above .",
    "we now observe that conditionally on @xmath548 , the family @xmath549 is distributed as the sequence @xmath550 of the atoms of a poisson random measure on @xmath22 with intensity @xmath551 indeed , @xmath552 , and given @xmath553 , the image of the measure @xmath554 on @xmath555 by the map @xmath556 is @xmath557 on @xmath22 .    since @xmath558 , we deduce from this characterization that the sequences @xmath559 and @xmath560 have the same distribution , which implies that the finite - dimensional limits of @xmath561 and @xmath562 agree ( under our normalizations ) .",
    "in fact , this already follows from our previous considerations : we have seen in the proof of corollary [ c1 ] that the largest non - root clusters are of generation @xmath2 , and every such cluster is necessarily a cluster of rank @xmath2 ( but not every cluster of rank @xmath2 is of generation @xmath2 , see cluster @xmath545 in figure @xmath322 ) . for higher levels in the trees @xmath61 and @xmath544 , the limits do however not agree .",
    "this comes from the fact that clusters of generation @xmath563 can represent clusters of a strictly lower rank @xmath564 . roughly speaking , if such a cluster has a size of order @xmath565 , it is visible in the limit under the encoding by @xmath61 , while it is not under the encoding by @xmath544 .",
    "the tree of components is related to the so - called _ cut - tree _ , which is defined in terms of a discrete - time destruction process , where edges are removed according to some order , for example a random uniform order .",
    "more specifically , the cut - tree is a rooted binary tree which encodes the destruction of a tree @xmath566 on a finite vertex set @xmath3 in the following way .",
    "the root vertex is given by the set @xmath3 .",
    "then , if the first edge is removed , @xmath566 splits into two subtrees with respective vertex sets @xmath567 and @xmath568 , and these vertex sets are attached as the two children to the root @xmath3 .",
    "the construction is then iterated in the natural way - if , for example , the next edge is removed from the subtree with vertex set @xmath567 , the latter splits into two vertex sets @xmath569 and @xmath570 , which are regarded as the two children of @xmath567 . in particular , the leaves of the cut - tree can be identified with the vertices of @xmath566 .    unlike the tree of components , the cut - tree stores the vertex sets of the tree components and not merely their sizes .",
    "for example , in figure 4 the vertex sets of the tree components of the first generation , i.e. @xmath545 , @xmath571 , @xmath572 and @xmath573 ( in the order of their appearance ) , are represented by the vertices which are attached to the branch from the root @xmath574 to the leaf @xmath575 .",
    "the cut - tree has been analyzed for cayley trees and random recursive trees by bertoin in @xcite and @xcite , and then by bertoin and miermont @xcite and dieuleveut @xcite for galton - watson trees .",
    "their results can be used to obtain limit theorems for the number of steps to isolate a certain family of nodes , and in a similar direction , we believe that the tree of components can prove helpful , too .      99 wiley , third edition ( 2008 ) .",
