    "it has found numerous applications in classical enumerative geometry and is a central object in gromov - witten theory .",
    "however , most applications in enumerative geometry and some results in gw - theory have been restricted to the genus - zero case .",
    "the reason for this is essentially that the genus - zero moduli space has a particularly simple structure : it is smooth and contains the space of smooth genus - zero curves as a dense open subset .",
    "on the other hand , the moduli spaces of positive - genus stable maps fail to satisfy either of these two properties .",
    "in fact , @xmath9 can be arbitrarily singular according to  @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to ask whether these failings can be remedied by modifying @xmath9 , preferably in a way that leads to a range of applications .",
    "as announced in  @xcite and shown in this paper , the answer is yes if @xmath10 .",
    "+ we denote by @xmath11 the subset of @xmath2 consisting of the stable maps that have smooth domains . this space is smooth and contains the space of genus - one curves with @xmath0 distinct marked points in @xmath6 as a dense open subset , provided @xmath12 .",

    "while @xmath3 is not smooth , it turns out that a natural sequence of blowups along loci disjoint from @xmath11 leads to a desingularization of @xmath3 , which will be denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "+ the situation is as good as one could possibly hope .",
    "a general strategy when attempting to desingularize some space is to blow up the `` most degenerate '' locus , then the proper transform of the `` next most degenerate locus '' , and so on .",
    "this strategy works here , but with a novel twist : we apply it to the entire space of stable maps @xmath2 .",
    "the most degenerate locus is in fact an entire irreducible component , and blowing it up removes it .",
    "hence one by one we erase the `` bad '' components of @xmath2 .",
    "each blowup of course changes the `` good '' component @xmath3 , and miraculously at the end of the process the resulting space @xmath13 is nonsingular .",
    "we note that this can not possibly be true for an arbitrary @xmath5 , as @xmath14 behaves quite badly according to  @xcite .",
    "the sequential blowup construction itself is beautifully simple .",
    "it is completely described in the part of subsection  [ descr_subs ] ending with the main theorem of the paper , theorem  [ main_thm ] . however , showing that @xmath13 is in fact smooth requires a considerable amount of preparation ( which takes up subsections  [ curveprelim_subs]-[map1prelim_subs ] ) and is finally completed in subsection  [ map1blconstr_subs ] .",
    "+ the desingularization @xmath13 of @xmath3 possesses a number of `` good '' properties and has a variety of applications to enumerative algebraic geometry and gromov - witten theory .",
    "it has already been observed in  @xcite that the cohomology of @xmath13 behaves in a certain respect like the cohomology of the moduli space of genus - one curves , @xmath15 .",
    "the space @xmath13 can be used to count genus - one curves in  @xmath6 , mimicking the genus - zero results of  @xcite and  @xcite ( though perhaps not their simple recursive formulas ) . proceeding analogously to the genus - zero case ( e.g.  as in  @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ) , theorem  [ main_thm ]",
    "can then be used to count genus - one curves with tangency conditions and singularities . in all cases ,",
    "such counts can be expressed as integrals of natural cohomology classes on @xmath3 or @xmath13 .",
    "integrals on the latter space can be computed using the localization theorem of  @xcite , as @xmath13 is smooth and inherits a torus action from @xmath6 and @xmath2 .",
    "+ we next discuss two types of applications of theorem  [ main_thm ] in gromov - witten theory , as well as a bonus result of this paper , theorem  [ cone_thm ] .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite and  @xcite that the space @xmath3 has a natural generalization to arbitrary almost kahler manifolds and gives rise to new symplectic _ reduced genus - one gw_-invariants .",
    "these reduced invariants are yet to be constructed in algebraic geometry .",
    "however , the spaces @xmath13 do possess a number of `` good '' properties and give rise to algebraic invariants of algebraic manifolds ; see the first and last sections of  @xcite .",
