    "looking more closely at the klln function @xmath17 of three particles with masses @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the analytic behaviour unfolds a rich spectrum of real and virtual processes .",
    "the function is zero for any one of the thresholds @xmath21 allowing only positive values for the three masses , in the @xmath22 phase space the zeros of the klln function are located on the three planes spanned by each two of the three face diagonals @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . up to the general normalization one can visualise the phase space by cutting the first octant by a plane orthogonal to the space diagonal . on this plane",

    "the zeros of the klln function are found on the three lines connecting the midpoints of the sides of the triangle ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ viretri ] ) . the equilateral triangle enclosed by these three lines",
    "is called the _",
    "klln triangle_. while this triangle is the region where the klln function becomes negative , the other three triangles are regions with positive klln function , each of them containing a coordinate axis .",

    "this means physically that none of the three particles can decay into the other two .",
    "the process is a virtual one , leaving at least one of the particles off - shell , i.e.  with a momentum squared which is smaller than the squared mass of this particle . on the other hand",
    ", a positive klln function means that exactly one decay channel is real .",
    "taking for instance the region connected to the @xmath18 axis , all points in the lower left triangle in fig .",
    "[ viretri ] represent possible decays through the channel @xmath29 because @xmath18 is larger than the sum @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the triangle in fig .",
    "[ viretri ] gives structure and direction to processes involving three massive particles .",
    "usually , three - particle interactions appear within a more complicated process . in this case",
    "the masses are ( partially ) replaced by invariant squared momenta @xmath31 . on tree level",
    "such a process is a cascade process as explained for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite . for a cascade process",
    "including @xmath32 final particles with masses @xmath26 ( @xmath33 ) the @xmath32-particle phase space @xmath34 can be factorized .",
    "given for instance the momentum @xmath35 of the first particle emitted from this process , the remaining momentum @xmath36 is mediated by a virtual particle .",
    "one can define an invariant mass @xmath37 with @xmath38 with the only condition that @xmath39 is time - like . separating the first phase space integration from the other ones and inserting the trivial identities @xmath40 one obtains  @xcite @xmath41 as an example we consider the cascade decay @xmath42 .",
    "the first part @xmath43 of the cascade phase space is given by the phase space @xmath44 of the previous ( simpler ) process @xmath45 where @xmath46 is replaced by @xmath47 .",
    "for the second part @xmath48 one obtains in a similar manner @xmath49 assuming that one can perform the solid angle integrations for the @xmath3 boson ( @xmath50 ) and for the @xmath51 quark ( @xmath52 ) trivially , one is left with the three - particle phase space @xmath53      the example just introduced is an ideal playground for the implications caused by the klln functions in case of integrations over inner lines . even though the intermediate @xmath3 boson can be off - shell , the phase space has to be real .",
    "therefore , the two conditions @xmath54 \\lambda(p_w^2,m_c^2,m_s^2)&=&(p_w^2-(m_c - m_s)^2)(p_w^2-(m_c+m_s)^2)\\ \\ge\\ 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] determine the phase space region for @xmath55 and at the same time an appropriate substitution to calculate the integral analytically . taking into account the known quark mass hierarchy",
    ", the two conditions result in @xmath56      neglecting the masses of @xmath51 and @xmath57 quarks , the phase space simplifies to @xmath58 the square root in eq .",
    "( [ intpw2 ] ) can be simplified by choosing one of the factors in eq .",
    "( [ kallentbw ] ) as new variable , e.g.@xmath59 .",
    "the second factor is then given by @xmath60 and the upper limit is given by @xmath61 .",
    "however , @xmath62 is not the optimal choice . using instead",
    "@xmath63 the square root simplifies to @xmath64 the integration can be performed by using @xmath65 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 finally , one can use @xmath68 to obtain @xmath69      to conclude this section , let us dwell on the parameter @xmath70 used in the substitution .",
    "this parameter is related to the masses and the invariant momentum square by @xmath71 comparing with eqs .",
    "( [ ebw ] ) and  ( [ pbw ] ) one realizes that @xmath70 is the rapidity for the transition between the @xmath72 and @xmath73 quark rest frames , the exponential representation being @xmath74",
    "dilogarithms appear after integrations like the one in eq .",
    "( [ intpw2 ] ) are performed .",
    "the `` classical '' dilogarithm is given by the integral representation @xmath75 the classical dilogarithm is a special case of a polylogarithm and is an analytical function in the whole complex plane except for the interval @xmath76 $ ] along the positive real axis where the branch cut is located .",
    "starting from the branch point at @xmath77 the branch cut separates two different riemannian sheets of the multi - valued function .",
    "there are two one - parameter and a couple of two- and three - parameter identities that allow to relate dilogarithms with different arguments  @xcite .",
    "the two one - parameter identities are given by  @xcite @xmath78 an additional useful identity is @xmath79    [ cols=\">,^,^,^ , < \" , ]      for the arguments of the dilogarithms the two identities  ( [ dilog1 ] ) and  ( [ dilog2 ] ) are involutions .",
    "because of this , one can create a closed chain of transitions for the argument which constitutes a hexagon ( cf.fig .",
    "[ hexagon ] ) . for real - valued arguments",
    "this transition orbit helps to constrain the argument to a value lower or equal to @xmath80 , gaining a real value for the dilogarithm .",
    "a pragmatic argument can be very helpful to choose an appropriate hexagon orbit transition : processes including only real particles have to lead to real phase space integrals .",
    "therefore , a negative argument for the logarithms obtained together with the dilogarithm in calculations like @xmath81 indicate that the argument of the dilogarithm still is not in an appropriate form .      a similar orbit , though for complex arguments , is given in refs .",
    "@xcite for the bloch  wigner dilogarithm @xmath82 which is mainly ( i.e.  up to a double - logarithmic correction ) the imaginary part of the classical dilogarithm .",
    "the identities , induced by the two involutions , are given by @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in ref .",
    "@xcite these identities are applied to the ( complex ) root @xmath85 where the discriminant @xmath17 is again the klln function , assumed to be negative .",
    "an orbit with constant value for @xmath86 given by @xmath87 is obtained by combining the two involutions with a third one , namely the calculation of the complex conjugate . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the points of the orbit can be obtained from the starting point @xmath88 by interchanging the squared masses @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "this invariance describes a symmetry of the bloch  wigner dilogarithm which is manifest already for the klln function . in the following we compare these two functions .     +      because the bloch  wigner dilogarithm vanishes for positive values of the klln function , the support of the bloch  wigner dilogarithm and the klln function within the domain triangle are both given by the klln triangle shown in fig .",
    "[ viretri ] . a first glimpse on the topographical plot of both functions in fig .  [ viretop ] might lead to the conjecture that these functions are the same up to normalization . in order to ( dis)prove this conjecture we have to compare the contour lines of the two functions",
    ".      the domain triangle is parametrized by @xmath92 and confined by the three straight lines connecting the points @xmath93 even though the domain triangle and , as a part of it , the klln triangle in fig .",
    "[ viretri ] represent the kinematic situation in the most symmetrical way ( cf .",
    "[ viretop ] ) , there is at least a second representation which is more appropriate for calculating .",
    "one can solve the projective condition @xmath94 with fixed value @xmath95 for @xmath20 . in this case",
    "the domain triangle is projected onto the @xmath96 plane . the resulting _ projective triangle _",
    "is confined by the two axes and the line @xmath97 .",
    "the contour line of the klln function with fixed ( negative ) value @xmath98 in the projective plane @xmath94 is given by @xmath99 for @xmath100 the contour degenerates to a triangle confined by the lines @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 which is isomorphic to the klln triangle . for @xmath104 the contour lines run within this projective form of the klln triangle .",
    "it can be easily seen that the minimal value of the klln function is found at @xmath105 with a value @xmath106 . in the parametrization  ( [ mxmy ] ) of the domain triangle",
    "the minimum is located at @xmath107 .",
    "the value of the bloch  wigner dilogarithm is maximal at the same point @xmath105 ( or @xmath108 ) , resulting in @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the clausen function . however ,",
    "if taking an intermediate value for @xmath98 , a contour line for the klln function has not a constant height for the bloch  wigner dilogarithm .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ virecon ] for three different values of @xmath98 .",
    "in this brief note we have shown that the appearance of the kllen function is always related to the virtuality or reality of three - particle interactions .",
    "we have derived kinematic relations , phase space limits and the relationship to lorentz boosts .",
    "starting from the hexagon orbit for classical dilogarithms we have considered the invariance of the bloch  wigner dilogarithm under a similar hexagon orbit , showing similar symmetry properties and the same support for the bloch  wigner dilogarithm and the klln function .",
