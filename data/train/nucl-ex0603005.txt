    "it is a common belief that in the early stage of a reaction the excitation energy is shared by a small number of nucleons .",

    "two components are visible : that for the higher energies is a smooth curve while for smaller energies @xmath43 reflects the barrier penetration .",
    "it is interesting to note that the higher energy component follows almost a straight line with uniform slope . in order to show this effects",
    "we have fitted a straight line to the case of @xmath4-particle emission with the aluminum target .",
    "this line without any shift also passes through the bulk of points in case of other imf types although not perfectly fitting the data .",
    "this may be an evidence that equilibration proceeds in an almost unique way independent of the target size .",
    "however , in order to extract angle integrated cross sections the fitted values with error bars were applied .    in order to test the assumption that the low energy part is dominated by barrier penetration",
    "we have fitted one single source with a constant temperature and a constant source velocity to the cross sections in the range from 1530 mev .",
    "the usual practice , as we have also applied above , namely , to correct the energy by subtracting the coulomb barrier energy , is not applicable since it leads to negative energies .",

    "the rather small coulomb barrier of 17.67(23 ) mev corresponds to a large radius of the emitting system .",
    "this might be an indication that the highly excited nucleus has expanded .",

    "in this section model calculations are compared to the deduced data .",
    "a variety of models for fast particle emission in nuclear reactions are discussed in ref .",
    "a model especially suited for higher projectile energies is the intranuclear cascade model ( inc ) .",
    "although it can not account for imfs during the equilibration process it predicts the final excitation energy of an equilibrated system .",
    "this system then undergoes de - excitation by evaporating lower energy particles .",
    "the inc model was first proposed by serber in 1947 @xcite .",
    "the successful realization of this model by means of monte carlo simulations was published by goldberger who did the first calculations by hand in 1948 @xcite .",
    "computer simulations were first done by metropolis et al .",
    "@xcite . in the present work",
    "we have applied the model in the standard li@xmath69ge version incl4.2 @xcite .    the intranuclear cascade ( inc ) model simulates - by the monte carlo method - sequences of the nucleon - nucleon collisions proceeding inside the nucleus .",
    "this is equivalent to solving the boltzmann transport equation for the time dependent distribution of the nucleons in the nucleus , treating explicitly collisions between the nucleons .",
    "as mentioned above , such a picture of the reaction is justified in the case when the energy of the projectile is high enough .",
    "the inc is stopped when signatures are fulfilled , which indicate equilibration of the decaying nucleus . in the incl4.2 code",
    "the equilibration time @xmath70 is determined by reaching a constant emission rate of cascade particles during the inc process .",
    "typically @xmath70 is of the order of @xmath71s or 30 fm / c .",
    "the longer this somewhat `` artificially '' chosen time the smaller @xmath72 is left for the evaporation process .",
    "here we have chosen @xmath73 with @xmath74 fm / c .",
    "this is smaller than the value used in @xcite but corresponds to the earlier used value @xcite .",
    "the description of each cascade involves three different stages : ( i ) initialization of the properties of the spatial and momentum distribution of nucleons in the nucleus , ( ii ) propagation of nucleons inside the nucleus , and ( iii ) collisions of the nucleons .",
    "the simplicity of the model and speed of calculations makes the incl model very attractive . of course the model can not efficiently describe evaporation of the particles from the compound nucleus formed in the first stage of the reaction for two reasons : ( a ) the evaporation is very sensitive to the density of states of the nuclei participating in the reaction , whereas the single particle density of states implicitly present in the incl calculations is not exact enough , and ( b ) the calculations of the cascade over such long times as those characteristic for the compound nucleus emissions are not stable numerically and very inefficient .",
    "the other very serious drawback of the incl model is absence of correlations between nucleons , which could lead to emission of complex fragments .",
    "this is because the incl is a single particle model with the mean field treated in an oversimplified manner .",
    "the mean field used in the incl makes the assumption of being constant throughout the volume of the nucleus or modified at the surface of the nucleus , but it is always a static field .    in practice the model of the intranuclear cascade ( or equivalent ) is applied to describe the first stage of the nuclear collision and the calculations are stopped once it can be assumed that equilibrium has been achieved . in the present study",
