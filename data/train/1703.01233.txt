    "the values of the pion polarizabilities are very sensitive to predictions of different theoretical models .",
    "therefore , an accurate experimental determination of these parameters is very important for testing the validity of such models .",
    "the most of experimental data obtained for the difference of the dipole polarizabilities of the charged pions are presented in table i.    the polarizabilities were determined by analyzing the processes of the high energy pions scattering in the coulomb field of heavy nuclei @xmath15 via the primakoff effect , radiative pion photoproduction from proton @xmath16 , and two - photon production of pion pairs @xmath17 . as seen from table i , the data vary from 4 up to 40 and are in conflict even for experiments performed with the same method . in this paper",

    "the theoretical calculations of the cross section for the reaction @xmath22 show that the contribution of nucleon resonances is suppressed for photons scattered backward in the c.m .",
    "system of the reaction @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , integration over @xmath24 and @xmath25 essentially decreases the contribution of nucleon resonances from the crossed channels .",
    "in addition , the difference @xmath26 gives the biggest contribution to the cross section for @xmath25 in the same region of @xmath27 . therefore , one considered the cross section of radiative pion photoproduction integrated over @xmath24 from @xmath28 to @xmath29 and over @xmath25 from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , @xmath32 the work was carried out at values of @xmath9 up to 15@xmath33 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the contribution of the @xmath0-meson is noticeable at such high values of @xmath9 .",
    "the contributions of other mesonic resonances @xmath34 are negligible here .",
    "the values of the pion polarizabilities have been obtained from a fit of the cross section calculated by two different theoretical models to the data . in the first model",

    "it should be noted that the contribution of the sum of the pion polarizabilities is very small in the considered region of @xmath39 .",
    "the estimate shows that the contribution of @xmath40 to the value of @xmath26 is less than 1% .    to increase the confidence that the model dependence of the result was under control , kinematic regions were considered where the difference between the models did not exceed @xmath41 when @xmath26 is constrained to zero .",
    "first , the kinematic region was considered where the contribution of the pion polarizability is negligible , i.e. the region @xmath42 .",
    "then the kinematic region was investigated where the polarizability contribution is biggest .",
    "this is the region @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in the range @xmath45 the polarizability contribution",
    "is small and this region was excluded .",
    "analysis of these data gave the following result @xmath46    an independent analysis @xcite of the experimental data was carried out by a constrained @xmath47 fit .",

    "the result @xcite is consisted with earlier works investigating the @xmath22 @xcite and @xmath48 @xcite reactions , and also with @xcite , where a global fit to all existing data for the @xmath49 reaction was done .",
    "on the other hand , the result @xcite is in conflict with the prediction of chpt @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be connected with a different account of the contribution of the @xmath0-meson and vector mesons in the dispersion relations and chpt calculations @xcite .",
    "the first experimental data on the charged pion polarizability was obtained in the work @xcite .",
    "they studied the scattering of high energy @xmath50 mesons off the coulomb field of heavy nuclei .",
    "a connection of the radiative scattering in the coulomb field with the compton scattering was first predicted in the work @xcite .",
    "the cross section of the radiative pion scattering @xmath51 via the primakoff effect can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the electromagnetic form - factor of nucleus , @xmath54 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath55 is the charge number of the nucleus , and @xmath56 is the negative 4-momenta transfer squared , @xmath57 .",

    "the experiment @xcite was carried at a beam energy equal to 40 gev . in this case if the energy of the incident photon in the incident pion rest frame @xmath64 mev , then @xmath58 is equal to @xmath65 ( gev / c)@xmath66 .",
    "it was shown that the coulomb amplitude dominates in this case for @xmath67(gev / c)@xmath66 .",
    "the experiment @xcite was carried out at @xmath68(gev / c)@xmath66 .",
    "events in the region of @xmath56 of @xmath69(gev / c)@xmath66 were used for estimation of the strong interaction background .",
    "this background was assumed to behave either as @xmath70 in the region @xmath71(gev / c)@xmath66 or as a constant .",
    "the polarizability was determined from the ratio ( assuming @xmath72 ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 refers to the measured cross section and @xmath75 to simulated cross section expected for @xmath76 , @xmath77 in the laboratory system of the process @xmath51 . as a result",

    "the compass experiment @xcite was performed with @xmath81 gev . for such values of @xmath61",

    "@xcite the authors considered @xmath83 ( gev / c)@xmath66 .",
    "as shown in @xcite the basic ratio @xmath84 is applicable for the coulomb peak only . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is elaborated that the coulomb amplitude interference with the coherent nuclear amplitude is important for @xmath85(gev / c)@xmath66 .",
    "this means that the serpukhov analysis could safely apply the ratio @xmath84 in ( [ r ] ) , whereas compass has to consider the interference of the coulomb and strong amplitude .",
    "the phase determined with the simple considerations in ref .",
    "@xcite for the serpukhov experiment @xcite is close to @xmath86 meaning that the subtraction of a nuclear background assumed to be incoherent is justified . in the compass analysis",
    "a gaussian profile function is used for the diffractive background and the relative phase is determined by a fit to the cross sections .",

    "@xcite all bumps in fig .",
    "3(c ) are well reproduced and again a phase is close to @xmath86 is indicated @xcite . without a real fit to the data it is impossible to estimate the effect of the model dependence of the diffractive background , but that it will have an influence is clear from ref .",
    "considering this situation the discussion of the central subtraction of the diffractive background is insufficient to get a feeling for model dependence of the analysis .",
    "comparison of data with different targets provide the possibility to check the @xmath87 dependence for the primakoff cross section and to estimate a possible contribution of the nuclear background .",
    "such an investigation was performed by the serpukhov collaboration and they have obtained @xmath87 dependence with good enough accuracy .",
    "the compass collaboration really have gotten their main result using only @xmath88 target but they wrote that they also considered other targets on small statistic and obtained approximate @xmath89 dependence .    it should be noted that in order to get an information about the pion polarizabilities , the authors considered the cross section of the process @xmath90 equal to the born cross section and the interference of the born amplitude with the pion polarizabilities only .",
    "the compass collaboration analyzed this process up to the total energy @xmath91 mev in the angular range @xmath92 .",
    "however , the contribution of the @xmath0-meson to the cross section of the compton scattering on the pion could be very substantial in this region of the energy and angles .",

    "the subtraction function @xmath100 was determined with help of the dr at fixed @xmath6 with one subtraction where the subtraction constant was expressed through the difference @xmath26 : @xmath101 the drs for the amplitude @xmath102 have the same expressions ( [ ds ] ) and ( [ sub ] ) with substitutions : @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath95 and @xmath96 were calculated with help of these drs taking into account contribution of the following mesons : @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 mesons in the @xmath9-channel and @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 mesons in the @xmath5-channel .",
    "it has been shown that the contribution of all these mesons , with exception of the @xmath0-meson , is very small in the region of the energy and the angles of the compass experiment .    according drs ( [ sub ] ) the contribution of the @xmath0-meson",

    "the magnitude of @xmath26 is very sensitive to parameters of the @xmath0-meson and can reach a value of @xmath136 for the parameters from @xcite .",
    "so , the contribution of the @xmath0-meson can essentially change the compass result .",
    "it should be noted that the contribution of the @xmath0-meson was not considered in serpukhov as well .",
    "however , in this case , the contribution of the @xmath0-meson for the serpukhov kinematics is @xmath137 within the experimental error of the serpukhov result .",
    "the information about pion polarizabilities could be obtained also by studying the cross section of the reaction @xmath49 .",
    "authors of most dispersion approaches used drs for partial waves taking into account the contribution of @xmath138 and @xmath139 wave only .",
    "moreover , they often used additional assumptions , for example , to determine subtraction constants .",
    "the dipole polarizabilities of charged pions were obtained in works @xcite from the analysis of the experimental data in the region of the low energy ( @xmath140 mev ) mainly ( where @xmath141 is the total energy in @xmath142 c.m .",
    "the most of results for the charged pion polarizabilities obtained in these works are close to the chpt prediction @xcite . on the other hand , the values of the experimental cross section of the process @xmath49 in this region are very ambiguous .",
    "therefore , as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , even changes of these values by more than 100% are still compatible with the present error bars in the energy region considered .",

    "the following values of @xmath144 and @xmath145 have been found in these works .",
    "in addition , for the first time there were obtained quadrupole polarizabilities for both charged and neutral pions .",
    "the new result of the calculation of the total cross section of the process @xmath49 at @xmath146 in the frame of the drs @xcite has been obtained with the @xmath0-meson considered as a pole on the second riemann sheet .",
