    "the most accepted theory for the formation of galaxies is that they formed in a series of hierarchical mergers over cosmic time , which played an important role in their subsequent growth and morphological evolution @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed effects of the mergers and interactions on the subsequent evolution of the galaxies are still uncertain .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to identify and study local galaxies that are currently undergoing such interactions .",
    "multi - wavelength observations are of paramount importance in reconstructing the star formation history ( sfh ) of interacting galaxies and in identifying the spectral signatures of their interactions .",
    "the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) to mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) coverage of ngc  6872 and ic  4970 ( hereafter the condor galaxy and its companion , respectively ) provides important information on their youngest star forming regions and total stellar mass , rendering this system a perfect laboratory for studying the effects of galaxy interactions on their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) @xcite .",
    "the condor galaxy is a giant interacting spiral located in the dynamically young southern pavo group together with 12 other members @xcite .",
    "we place it in this work at a distance of 65  mpc @xcite , and adjust all the previous literature values to this distance citing the original distances and measurements .",
    "the condor has been the focus of several observational and theoretical studies in the past and has been suspected to be one of the largest - known spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "using uv observations made with the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( ) satellite we show that the arms of the condor are longer than any other known spiral galaxy , measuring more than 160kpc ( projected ) from tip to tip .",
    "the physical extent of its arms is often attributed to the recent interaction of the condor with its closest companion ic  4970 , an s0 galaxy located 1.1  north of condor s center .",
    "the condor , however , has also interacted with an elliptical galaxy in the group , ngc  6876 , located 8.7  to the se of condor s center . this interaction has formed the longest - known x - ray trail , extending from the condor to ngc  6876 @xcite .    numerical simulations of galaxy interactions also suggest the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) at the two far sides of the disk of the primary galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , previous searches by @xcite for these tdgs in the condor have yielded no results .",
    "they found rich star clusters with ages between 1 and 100  myr in the extended arms , using vlt / fors1 in b , v and i. they also found that the eastern extended arm is forming stars at 2 times the rate of the western one and 5 times the rate of the main body , based on the u - band surface density .",
    "the interaction between the condor and its companion was first modeled by n - body simulations of @xcite , assuming that the further elliptical galaxy ngc  6876 played little or no role in the dynamics of the pair and that the condor was five times more massive than its closest companion .",
    "the model reproduced many morphological features of the interacting pair , including the formation of condor s stellar bar and the extent of the optical tidal tails .",
    "however , the modeled spatial distribution of star formation did not reproduce the h@xmath0  observations . while the model displayed the majority of the star formation in the bar and in the central region of the galaxy , their h@xmath0  data supported star formation occurring mostly along the tidal arms . at that time",
    ", the galaxy was thought to be very gas poor , since an  21  cm non - detection by @xcite had assigned a 3-@xmath1 upper limit of @xmath2 at 91.1  mpc ] of  for the whole galaxy .",
    "based on the fact that the most intense h@xmath0  emitting regions coincided with regions with highest h@xmath0  velocities dispersions , @xcite concluded the dominant mode of star formation in the condor is collisionally - induced , and that , without the triggering by the interaction , the condor would show little or no star formation at all .",
    "they also noted the galaxy was cold compared to other interacting galaxies and that possibly a considerable fraction of its ir emission is not associated with the recent star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "later @xcite detected of a significantly larger reservoir with @xmath3 of  gas for the whole system as well as @xmath4 of hydrogen molecular gas of  and @xmath5 of @xmath6 , respectively , at 59.8  mpc ] for the central 6.7  kpc of the condor ( 43  in diameter ) , making the interacting pair one of the gas - richest known .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented higher resolution  interferometric data taken with atca ( australia telescope compact array ) , from which they inferred the presence of only @xmath7 of  gas total , with @xmath8 for the condor and @xmath9 for the companion , at 61  mpc ] . of these , they assigned @xmath10 to the condor , distributed in an extended rotating disk , and the remaining @xmath11 to its companion .",
    "this means as much as @xmath12 of missing  should be extended in scales larger than their expected size of the galaxy .",
    "no association of it with the x - ray trail between the condor and the elliptical ngc  6876 was found .",
    "their new  interferometric data show large concentrations of atomic gas in the spiral arms and a central area almost devoid of it .",
    "they also introduced a new n - body simulation including stars and gas , and also assumed the companion was five times less massive than the condor . in the simulation",
    ", they were able to reproduce the thin arms as seen in the  and optical maps .",
    "their analysis supports the scenario of a low - inclination prograde passage , now seen 130  myr after closest approach .",
    "condor s large size enables a thorough analysis of the different sub - galactic regions that underwent star formation because of the interaction , and studies of the spatial variations in the resulting stellar and gas components of these regions , on scales of galactic proportions , of the order of @xmath13 . from this uv  to  mid - ir multi - wavelength dataset and evolutionary stellar population synthesis models , we derive stellar masses and star formation rates ( sfrs ) across the galaxy and compare them with the results of the simulations and previous analyses .",
    "we set out to ( 1 ) test if condor s stellar bar was formed by the interaction , ( 2 ) test if star formation is concentrated in the bar and central areas , ( 3 ) test if the dominant mode of star formation is induced by the interaction , ( 4 ) obtain the ratio of stellar masses between the condor and companion , and ( 5 ) check the use of uv+ir as a tracer of the sfr in the different regions .    the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : data ] we describe the data used in the analysis and the selected regions for detailed photometric analysis . in ",

    "therefore , we refer to region 1 as a tdg - candidate . later in the paper",

    "the condor has a particularly long bar . to determine its size",
    ", we performed a 2-d bulge / bar / disk decomposition of the condor using the  3.6@xmath297 m  image and the budda software package ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which indicates that the disk profile has an outer break , from where the profile is shallower than inwards , i.e. the disk is a type iii disk ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the decomposition gives a bar semi - major axis of @xmath299  kpc , and a disk scale length of @xmath300  kpc .",

    "this could be an indication that the length of the bar has not been abruptly affected by the interaction with the companion .",
    "alternatively , the interaction could have increased the disk scale - length accordingly , keeping to some extent constant the ratio between bar length and disk scale - length .",
    "@xcite shows evidence that in some barred galaxies star formation occurs throughout the bar , whereas in other barred galaxies star formation is confined to the bar center and ends .",
    "the condor falls in the second category , since its h@xmath0  @xcite , uv , mid - ir maps suggest the star formation is confined to the ends of the bar and spiral arms . comparing the seds of the nucleus and regions of the bar on 5  scale ( 1.5  kpc )",
    ", we found them to be almost identical and therefore equally old .",
    "this suggests an evolved bar , and an old pre - collision stellar population in both the bar and the nucleus .",
    "there is therefore no spectral signature of a young population in the bar .",
    "we also find no signs of a box - peanut structure near the central region .",
    "the absence of such morphological feature would indicate a young bar , i.e. one with a dynamical age less than about 2 gyrs .",
    "however , the lack of such a structure could be a projection effect and should not be taken as conclusive evidence for the age of the bar .",
    "altogether , the evidence points to a bar that formed a few billion years before the interaction , as will be derived in a later section .",
    "it also suggests that the bar was not fed with gas at the interaction .",
    "the fact that star formation activity is not concentrated along the bar and central regions of the galaxy presents itself as a major challenge to the current simulations describing the state of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite pointed out an improvement to the model in which the condor had a uniform gas disk .",
    "if prior to the interaction with the companion the  gas was distributed at larger radii , with a central region devoid of  gas instead , star formation would be strongest along the spiral arms",
    ". this might be the case here , and future simulations should explore this possibility in more details .    a bar older than the interaction with the companion implies it was not formed by this interaction .",
    "the companion must have played a smaller role in shaping the condor than previously thought .",
    "the more distant elliptical companion ngc  6876 could have shaped the condor over a longer period of time , possibly distorting its disk and contributing to the formation of the bar instability much before the interaction with the companion started , in the last 130  myr .",
    "modeling the star formation rate as function of time , i.e. the sfh , of a complex stellar population is the key to obtain a reliable stellar mass and current sfr . from numerical simulations , interactions episodes between galaxies",
    "are usually followed by an enhancement in star formation that decays roughly exponentially , as seen in @xcite , with decay constant varying from case to case .    in the last decades , with the large availability of multi - wavelength data and the improvements in evolutionary population synthesis codes , modeling the sfh became necessary in order to describe the seds of all types of galaxies ( see reviews by @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "when modeling interacting systems , previous works usually assume a superposition of one or two exponential decays and/or single instantaneous bursts for whole galaxies , sub - galactic regions , or clumps @xcite .",
    "since the condor is a spiral galaxy we model the sfh as a single component represented by an exponential function :    @xmath302    where @xmath303 is cosmic time , @xmath304 is the age of the universe at the onset of star formation , @xmath305 is the current epoch , so that @xmath306 is the age of the region , @xmath307 is the decay time , and @xmath308 is the total gas mass consumed by star formation as @xmath309 approaches infinity .",
    "we used the population synthesis code pgase.2 @xcite to generate the seds of the stellar populations , for a fixed solar metallicity ( @xmath310 ) and a kroupa initial mass function ( imf ) , given by @xcite : @xmath311 the specific luminosity is then @xmath312 where @xmath313 is the sed template obtained for a value of @xmath314 .",

    "a compound sfr derived in @xcite including fuv and  22  @xmath297 m  ( or nuv and  22  @xmath297 m ) luminosities leads to a sfr of @xmath465 ( or @xmath466 ) for all our regions combined .",

    "the initial attempt at modeling this system by @xcite assumed a ratio of 10 , which was implied from the b - band luminosities .",
    "however , they were unable to produce the thin tidal features inferred from the optical , and switched to a ratio of 5 instead .",
    "their simulation also produced mainly star formation in the central areas of the galaxy , but the current available ( h@xmath0 , fuv , and 22  @xmath297 m ) observations point to a different star formation morphology , with a very small fraction of the total sfr coming from the central region .",
    "as previously mentioned in  [ sec : bar ] , @xcite discussed another interaction scenario consisting initially not of a uniform gas disk for the condor , but of a disk with mass distributed only in its outskirts , devoid of gas within galactocentric distances up to 60% of the disk radius . under these initial conditions ,",
    "star formation would not be confined to the bar and central regions of the galaxy , but mainly taking place in the tidally disrupted spiral arms , which is the scenario supported by the current observations . considering the star formation morphology of the condor and the stellar mass ratio between the galaxies , it may be necessary to explore the possibility that the disk of the condor was already more extended before the passage of the companion and the effects of the interaction were not as strong as previously expected . furthermore , the role of the elliptical galaxy in the interaction may not be negligible , and may be in part responsible for the current morphology of the condor . further numerical simulations including star formation are necessary to address these issues .",
    "region 0 was found to enclose a quite low sfr of @xmath467 .",
    "a mass of @xmath6 molecular gas , @xmath468 , was derived from a single pointing co observation with a 43  fwhm beam by @xcite .",
    "their beam size is larger than the 32  diameter of region 0 .",
    "since no co map is available for the galaxy , the spatial distribution of the molecular gas is unclear .",
    "nevertheless , we can estimate the mass of molecular gas present in the central region of the condor using the @xcite relation between the sfr and the mass of dense , @xmath469 , molecular gas effectively forming stars , given by @xmath470 where @xmath471 is the fraction of molecular gas in this dense phase and @xmath472 is the total molecular gas mass .",
    "if all the @xmath473  of molecular gas is indeed located in region  0 , then only a small fraction @xmath474 can be in a dense phase . in this case , the molecular gas would be segregated from the  gas . on the other extreme , if all the molecular gas in region  0 is in a dense phase , i.e. @xmath475 , then only @xmath476 of molecular gas can be present in region 0 to sustain its sfr .",
    "this would be consistent with the deficiency of  gas in region  0 , as observed by @xcite",
    ". a co map , with higher angular resolution , would be crucial to point determine the distribution of dense molecular gas in the galaxy .",
    "our analysis makes clear the condor galaxy was already very massive ( @xmath477 ) prior to the encounter with the companion , which disturbed the morphology of the galaxy , but did not strongly affect its stellar or gas masses .",
    "the condor was possibly more extended and was less affected by the interaction with the companion ic  4970 than previously thought .",
    "the passage did trigger star formation in the system , as clearly seen by the bursts in regions 1 and 2 , with @xmath447  myr and @xmath478 , but quite low star formation efficiencies are expected in the central region . modeling the seds on smaller scales may reveal more localized effects of the collision .",
    "another issue of interest is the nature of region 1 , the bluest and outermost region , which could be a tdg .",
    "we have derived estimates the stellar mass of @xmath479 and sfr around @xmath480 .",
    "tdgs and tdg - candidates with similar sfrs and stellar masses can be found in @xcite , but this is not enough to to confirm it nor rule it out as a tdg . as mentioned previously , rotation curve and metallicity",
    "are necessary to confirm it as tdg .",
    "we , therefore , still refer to it as a tdg - candidate .",
    "the fuv emission traces the most massive , intrinsically young stars .",
    "the intrinsic fuv emission from stars is then a very good tracer of the current sfr .",
    "it is , however , attenuated by dust and therefore the observed fuv emission needs to be corrected for extinction before it is converted into a sfr .",
    "the dust present in star forming regions and in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , reprocesses the uv photospheric emission and reemits part of it in the ir . in an attempt to better trace sfr than from the observed fuv luminosity alone , one can complement it with by a single mid - ir band ( e.g. _ iras _ 25  or  24  ) .",
    "the choice of 25  @xmath297 m  emission is motivated by the fact that most of the emission at these wavelengths arises from dust that is heated by ionizing and non - ionizing uv photons associated with star formation activity .",
    "if the fuv extinction arises solely from the dust giving rise to the mid - ir emission , then the extinction corrected fuv luminosity can be written as : @xmath481 where @xmath482  is an empirically determined coefficient that related the dust emissivity at 25 micron to a fuv absorptivity .",
    "for this work , we use  22  as our mid - ir band , since no  mips data are available for this galaxy and _ iras _ data do not have enough spatial resolution to distinguish between our regions .",
    "@xcite shows that the  22  @xmath297 m  and  24  @xmath297 m  data are nearly equivalent for obtaining the unobscured sfrs to complement the obscured h@xmath0  sfr . for a large sample of regular galaxies ,",

    "this implies that a conversion derived from a large sample of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) overestimates the unobscured sfr for our regions at the galaxies centers ( as regions 0 and 16 ) and underestimates it for the outermost regions of the extended arms .    with the specific star formation rate , suggesting that the regional variations of @xmath482  arise from variations in the stellar populations that heat the dust .",
    "the value of @xmath482  for region 2 ( star ) is extrapolated from the  12  @xmath297 m . ]",
    "the reason for the variations in the value of @xmath482  for the different regions can be attributed to the different morphology and geometrical relation between the dust and the fuv emitting sources .",
    "a case in which all the 22  @xmath297 m  emitting dust is located between the observer and the fuv sources would require a different correction factor compared to a case where the 22  @xmath297 m  emitting dust is equally distributed in front and behind the fuv sources . obviously , if all the emitting dust would lie behind the source , the introduction of an ir correction would lead to an overestimate in the fuv derived sfr .    on a galactic scale ,",
    "we expect , from purely statistical reasons , an unbiased distribution of the dust with respect to the fuv emitting sources ( e.g. hao et al .",
    "this should apply to the regions studied here .",
    "since they as large as individual galaxies ( 10  kpc across ) , random geometrical effects should average out .",
    "solely on morphological considerations , an average value of @xmath482  may be applicable to galaxies as a whole or to galactic - scale regions in a galaxy , but inadequate in giving the correction for much smaller ( @xmath486kpc ) spatially - resolved star forming regions , which may have different foreground / background dust structures .",
    "another source of regional variations in the value of @xmath482  arises from the fact that the fuv and 22  @xmath297 m  emissions sample very different epochs of star formation activities .",
    "fuv emission arises predominately from massive , @xmath487  stars , which have lifetimes shorter than 30  myr .",
    "so the fuv emission samples the 30  myr - averaged sfr .",
    "the 22  @xmath297 m  emission arises from dust in  regions as well as stochastically - heated dust residing in the neutral  gas .",
    "the 22  @xmath297 m  emission can therefore originate from dust heated by a large range of stellar masses , as low as @xmath488  , which have a main sequence lifetime of 300  myr .",
    "for example , the central 5  kpc of the condor has copious 22  @xmath297 m  emission and no significant current star formation activity , as reflected by its sed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : seds_norm ] ) .",
    "its 22  @xmath297 m  emission is therefore powered by late time stars , not associated with the star formation of the last 100  myr .",
    "the 22  @xmath297 m  emission therefore samples the sfh of the galaxy that is averaged over a significantly larger epoch than the fuv emission .",
    "regional variations in @xmath482  may therefore reflect different sfh and different mixes of stellar populations .    to test this idea we plot in figure  [ fig : ssfr100_acorr ] the value of @xmath482  as a function of the specific star formation rate , ssfr , defined as the sfr divided by the total stellar mass .",
    "the figure shows a trend of increasing @xmath482  as a function of the ssfr . a lower value of the ssfr reflects a overabundance of stars over that expected from a constant sfr at a value of the current epoch .",
    "so in regions with a low ssfr , the 22  @xmath297 m  emission samples a longer epoch of star formation activity than in regions with a high ssfr , and a lower value of @xmath482  is needed to correct the observed fuv flux for extinction .",
    "this suggests that morphology is not driving the observed variation in @xmath482 , but the diversity in star formation histories and hence stellar populations .",
    "needed for the extinction - corrected fuv luminosity to be equal to the intrinsic one ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : fuv_corr ] and [ eq : fuv_sfr ] ) is plotted versus the specific sfr .",
    "the value of @xmath482  for region 2 ( star ) is extrapolated from the  12  @xmath297 m . ]",
    "we have investigated the interacting pair ngc  6872 and ic  4970 ( the condor galaxy and its companion ) from the uv to mid - ir , making use of data from , vlt , 2mass , , and .",
    "we inspected the  3.6  @xmath297 m  morphology of the condor galaxy by performing a bulge / bar / disk decomposition .",
    "this decomposition showed that both the bar semi - major axis and the disk scale - length of the galaxy are more than double the dimensions of the median values for non - interacting local barred galaxies .",
    "the ratio of 1.4 , however , is typical in the local universe and befits a giant type - iii disk . on top of that ,",
    "the resemblance of the seds of the nucleus and the bar , as well as the lack of a box - peanut structure suggests the bar was probably not formed by this interaction with companion either .",
    "in fact , the bar seems to be as old as the central region ( region 0 ) , with an age around 5  gyr , as derived by our sed fitting .",
    "this corroborates the idea that the interaction with the companion ic  4970 affected the condor less than previously thought and the idea that the condor galaxy was already a very massive ( @xmath489 ) and extended galaxy before the interaction .",
    "we have modeled the sfh of the condor galaxy , ngc  6872 , and its interacting companion , ic  4970 , on physical scales of the order of 10  kpc .",
    "the large size of the galaxy allowed us to sample 17 regions of 10  kpc projected diameter with very distinct spectra , and consequently star formation histories .",
    "the seds of these regions were presented in table  [ tab : seds_1 ] and figure  [ fig : seds_norm ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : seds_norm ] , the seds are shown normalized by the  4.5  @xmath297 m  measurement , which traces mainly emission from old stars .",
    "these normalized seds in figure  [ fig : seds_norm ] show a pronounced trend of bluer regions to the outskirts of the condor , with the bluest region having an observed fuv/4.5  @xmath297 m  flux ratio more than a thousand times higher than the central region of the galaxy .",
    "the 22  emission , as measured from , demonstrates the presence of dust , and therefore the need to correct the observed seds for the effects of extinction .",
    "the uv and mid - ir maps in fact suggest star formation is not concentrated in the bar and central regions of the condor , as predicted by previous numerical simulations by @xcite , but mainly in a ring and in the extended tidal arms . the ratio of stellar masses between the condor and the companion is larger than 12 , considerably larger than the one assumed in the previous numerical simulations of 5 .",
    "the evidence points to the need of examining more closely another scenario proposed by @xcite in which , prior to the interaction with the companion , the disk of the condor was not uniform , but a more extended mass distribution .",
    "the elliptical galaxy ngc  6876 may have played a larger role in shaping the condor than previously considered .",
    "the current co data do not allow us to be conclusive , but the star formation efficiency at the central region 0 would be remarkably low , with dense molecular gas fraction of @xmath490 , were the molecular gas indeed segregated from the  gas , concentrated at the center of the galaxy . if instead the molecular gas morphology is similar to the one of the  gas , the central region would have higher star formation efficiency , but a co map at higher spatial resolution is necessary to confirm this .",
    "the seds could be fit by a single exponential decay , with no need for an additional starburst component . from the sed",
    "modeling we find the outermost regions of the northeastern arm ( regions 1 and 2 ) to be intrinsically the youngest regions .",
    "their best - fit ages ( @xmath309 ) around 20  myr suggest they were assembled after the closest approach of the companion , 130  myr ago .",
    "regions 3 and 15 do have ages of the order of 100  myr , what is consistent with being formed during or slightly after closest approach .",
    "regions 5 - 14 , as well the condor s and its companion s centers ( regions 0 and 16 ) are all over a gigayear old and were assembled before the interaction with the companion started .",
    "if the interaction in fact enhanced sfr in these regions , it was not enough to deviate the sfh of these regions of their long - term , pre - collision sfh , represented by a single exponential decay .",
    "we then investigated the fuv luminosity as a tracer of recent sfr and how the  22  intensities can be used to estimate the fuv extinction ( see figures [ fig : fuv_sfr ] and [ fig : acorr ] ) .",
    "from this analysis we concluded that no single @xmath482-correction can be used for all regions and that @xmath482  increases as the ssfr increases .",
    "standard prescriptions ( e.g. @xcite ) to correct their observed fuv emission for extinction , as derived from large samples of galaxies , would underestimate the intrinsic fuv emission and consequently the actual sfrs for ngc  6872 taken as whole .",

    "<S> the extent of the condor provides an opportunity for detailed investigation of the impact of the interaction on the current star formation rate and its history across the galaxy , on the age and spatial distribution of its stellar population , and on the mechanism that drive the star formation activity . to address these issues we analyzed the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) to near - infrared ( near - ir ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of 17 , 10  kpc diameter , regions across the galaxy , and derived their star formation history , current star formation rate , and stellar population and mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of the star formation takes place in the extended arms , with very little star formation in the central 5  kpc of the galaxy , in contrast to what was predicted from previous numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> there is a trend of increasing star formation activity with distance from the nucleus of the galaxy , and no evidence for a recent increase in the current star formation rate ( sfr ) due to the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleus itself shows no significant current star formation activity . </S>",
    "<S> the extent of the condor also provides an opportunity to test the applicability of a single standard prescription for conversion of the fuv + ir ( 22 micron ) intensities to a star formation rate for all regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the conversion factor differs from region to region , arising from regional differences in the stellar populations . </S>"
