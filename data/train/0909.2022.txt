    "the startup of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) will allow the exploration of the tev energy regime and the testing of the multitude of proposed theories of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "many of these theories predict the existence of massive , neutral @xmath0-channel resonances  @xcite . for some models of new neutral gauge bosons ( @xmath3 )",
    ", the lhc is expected to have a discovery reach upwards of 5  tev with 100  fb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity  @xcite .",
    "this is a significant improvement over the current experimental limits for most models , which constrain @xmath3 masses to values greater than @xmath5  tev  @xcite .",
    "if a tev scale @xmath0-channel resonance were discovered , the immediate task would be to identify its origins .",
    "many observables have been proposed to this end , primarily focused on the dilepton channel ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , which would produce the cleanest and most easily measured signal for a non - leptophobic @xmath3  @xcite with the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite detectors .",
    "the proposed measurements for the dilepton channel are the @xmath8 width , total cross section , forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath2 )  @xcite , central - to - edge rapidity ratio  @xcite , and a comprehensive analysis of all rapidity regions  @xcite .",
    "there are challenges associated with some of these measurements that we argue can be alleviated by using the pseudorapidity of the final state fermions .",
    "in particular , we focus on two measurements : determining ( or at least constraining ) the spin of an @xmath0-channel resonance , and determining the forward - backward asymmetry of a @xmath3 . distinguishing whether the new resonance is a scalar , such as an r - parity violating sneutrino  @xcite , a spin-2 boson , such as a kk graviton  @xcite , or a spin-1 @xmath3  @xcite will be challenging and is typically determined through the study of the angular distribution in the centre - of - mass frame of the initial state quark and anti - quark ( c.m . )",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry measurement at the lhc has to deal with the ambiguity in defining the forward direction due to the inability to unambiguously determine the direction of the initial state quark in a symmetric proton - proton collision .",
    "presently , some solutions exist to deal with these challenges . to distinguish the spin of the resonance , a centre - edge asymmetry , @xmath1",
    ",  @xcite can be defined that is sensitive to the the angular distribution of the events .",
    "the centre - edge asymmetry is a simple means of binning the events in the central and edge regions of @xmath9 , the c.m .",
    "scattering angle , which will be weighted differently depending on the angular distribution .",
    "this has the benefit of eliminating some of the systematic uncertainties of a fit to the angular distribution .",
    "however , the @xmath1 observable still relies on boosting the particle four - momentum from the lab frame to the c.m",
    ". frame .",
    "the forward - backward ambiguity in a symmetric @xmath10 collision can be resolved by exploiting the fact that the valence quarks have , on average , larger momentum than the sea anti - quarks .",
    "the quark direction can then be identified with the boost direction of the dilepton system .",
    "@xcite . restricting the measurement to those events that have a large boost ( i.e. : @xmath11 )",
    "reduces the misidentification of the initial state quarks and antiquarks , resulting in greater than @xmath12 of dilepton events being correctly identified as being boosted by the quark  @xcite .",
    "both of these methods have been explored in great detail and remain the standard approach used in the literature  @xcite .",
    "both the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 measurements require analysis of the centre - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "angular distribution of the dilepton events - directly for @xmath1 , and when tagging forward or backward events in @xmath2 . in this note",
    "we propose a simpler method of measuring these asymmetries without reconstructing the angular distributions .",
    "specifically , we exploit the direct measurements of the lepton pseudorapidities to calculate the observables , rather than using derived quantities that may propagate uncertainties into the result",
    ". the proposed methods also take advantage of the fact that differences in pseudorapidities are lorentz invariant quantities , so that all calculations can be performed using quantities measured in the lab frame .",
    "the point of these methods is not to provide new phenomenological insight into the models , but rather to demonstrate how the use of final state pseudorapidities provides a simpler and cleaner means of obtaining the @xmath1 and @xmath2 values .",
    "the dimuon signal is very clean and error propagation should not be a big issue .",
    "the real power of this approach will be seen when applied to heavy quark final states  @xcite . in the following sections , we give some calculational details which are followed by a description of our approaches to the centre - edge asymmetry and the forward - backward asymmetry . we conclude with some final comments .",
    "the basic ingredients in our calculations are the cross sections , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath14 is described by the drell - yan process with the addition of a @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "analagous expressions for the spin-0 @xmath15 and spin-2 graviton are given in ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "we computed the cross sections using monte - carlo phase space integration with weighted events and imposed kinematic cuts to take into account detector acceptances , as described in the following sections .    in our numerical results",
    "we take @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19  gev , and @xmath20  gev  @xcite .",
    "we used the cteq6 m parton distribution functions  @xcite and included a k - factor to account for nlo qcd corrections @xcite .",
    "we neglected nnlo corrections , which are not numerically important to our results  @xcite , and final state qed radiation effects , which are potentially important  @xcite but require a detailed detector level simulation that is beyond the scope of the present analysis .",
    "the @xmath8 widths only include decays to standard model fermions and include nlo qcd and electroweak radiative corrections @xcite . for the @xmath15 width , we take @xmath21  gev following ref .",
    "expressions for the @xmath16 width can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the parton level angular distributions , @xmath22 , of the spin-0 , -1 , -2 bosons , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang_z ] , are distinct enough that , in principle , such a measurement would uniquely identify the spin  @xcite . however , these distributions are not directly accessible due to the convolution with the parton distributions of the protons , the boosting of measured lab frame quantities to the centre - of - mass frame , detector limitations and finite statistics , all of which will make the measurement challenging  @xcite .    the centre - edge asymmetry is almost entirely model - independent for spin-0 and spin-1 bosons .",
    "for example , assuming the narrow width approximation for a @xmath3 , we find that @xmath23 , for some value @xmath24 that separates the centre and edge regions of @xmath25 , independent of the couplings to fermions .",
    "spin-2 kk gravitons have contributions from @xmath26 and @xmath27 processes that have slightly different angular distributions , and the @xmath1 depends on the weighted contribution of each .",
    "the specific model will have an effect on the expected statistical uncertainties , but this should not be significant to the measurement due to the low backgrounds associated with leptonic final states .",
    "thus , with limited statistics , an @xmath1 measurement could have an advantage over a fit to the angular distribution .    for a hadron collider ,",
    "the centre - of - mass angle of the outgoing fermion is not directly measurable on an event by event basis due to the unknown values of the parton momentum fractions .",
    "however , there exists a direct mapping between the c.m .",
    "angular distribution and the difference in pseudorapidity of the final state lepton and anti - lepton , @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , it is straightforward to show that @xmath28 is a lorentz invariant quantity , so that measuring this quantity in the lab frame is equivalent to measuring it in the centre - of - mass frame : @xmath29 the normalized @xmath30 distributions for spin-0 , -1 , -2 resonances are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : norm_de ] , where it is clear that they are distinct from one another .",

    "@xcite , we take @xmath32 , which they find to be the `` optimal '' value , and translates to @xmath33 . experimentally , detector acceptance constrains the pseudorapidity of each fermion to @xmath34 , which limits @xmath35 for the distribution .    as is common in the literature , we take an r - parity violating @xmath15 with @xmath36 as an example of a spin-0 resonance  @xcite , and an rs graviton with @xmath37 for a spin-2 resonance @xcite .",
    "current experimental limits and studies on model parameters are given in ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . for the @xmath3 case we explored the @xmath38 models ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 )  @xcite , the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm , @xmath42 )  @xcite , both the littlest higgs ( lhm , @xmath43 )  @xcite and simplest little higgs ( slhm )  @xcite models , and the sequential standard model ( ssm ) .",
    "the spin-0 model , spin-2 and some @xmath3 models we study predict narrow resonances , such that including events within several widths of the peak will be impossible in practice due to detector resolution effects smearing the breit - wigner distribution . instead , we examine events within one dilepton invariant mass bin as defined in the atlas tdr  @xcite , using @xmath44  gev for the 1.5  tev resonance as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "a more precise measurement could be obtained by including events from a wider invariant mass window , if a broader peak were to be observed .    in table",

    "however , the @xmath8 and @xmath16 hypothesis could only be ruled out at approximately @xmath46 if a @xmath15 signal was observed .",
    "the primary limitation in distinguishing between the different possibilities is the low statistics for @xmath15 production , as shown in the table , which is due to the tight constraints on the allowed values of its couplings .",

    "forward \" direction .",
    "the choice of forward direction at the lhc is more subtle , and is conventionally defined as the direction of the @xmath3 rapidity , @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath8 rapidity is chosen because the parton distribution functions for the valence quarks peak at a higher momentum fraction than those of the anti - quarks , so the system has a higher probability of being boosted in the quark direction .",
    "this observation is statistical in nature and is more likely to hold true for larger values of @xmath54 . for smaller values of @xmath54 ,",
    "the momentum fractions of the quark and anti - quark are generally closer in magnitude , so that using @xmath54 in the low rapidity region is less likely to correctly identify the quark direction .    a simpler method of defining a  forward \" or ",

    "we note that a related technique is employed by the cdf collaboration  @xcite for the @xmath62 @xmath2 in @xmath52 collisions at the tevatron . however , the natural choice of the quark direction in @xmath52 collisions at the tevatron in contrast to @xmath10 collisions at the lhc results in important differences between the methods .    as in the conventional method for finding @xmath2 , for small values of @xmath54 ,",
    "there is a higher probability to wrongly assume that the quark is the parton with the higher momentum fraction .",
    "this results in incorrectly assigning the forward or backward direction and gives a small `` wrong '' contribution to the @xmath2 measurement . for this reason",
    ", it has been suggested that the central region , @xmath63 , be excluded in the measurement  @xcite .",
    "however , the coupling dependency can still be determined without this constraint on @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "another consideration for excluding the central region is that the number of events that remain after subtracting @xmath64 is small , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdy ] , while the total number of events in this region is large .",
    "excluding the events in the central region would increase the magnitude of @xmath2 , potentially making models more distinguishable .",
    "however , we found that increasing @xmath65 resulted in an increase in the relative uncertainty .",
    "we therefore conclude that little is gained by excluding events with small @xmath53 , and suggest that the whole rapidity region be included to decrease uncertainty and further simplify the @xmath2 measurement .    using this method",
    ", we calculate @xmath2 for the @xmath38 models ( @xmath39,@xmath40,@xmath41 )  @xcite , the left right symmetric model  @xcite , the littlest higgs model  @xcite , the simplest little higgs model  @xcite , and the sequential standard model .",

    "we conclude with the important observation that it might also be possible to include some events in the forward regions of the calorimeter ( fcal ) using this technique  @xcite .",
    "while a muon signature appears as missing @xmath68 in the fcal , it may be possible to distinguish an electron from a jet in the fcal due to the differences in the showering .",
    "the signal would require triggering off of a single , high @xmath69 electron in the @xmath34 region , with an electron - jet in the fcal .",
    "determining the charge sign of the single electron would distinguish whether this is a  forward \" or ",
    "backward \" tagged event .",
    "it is not clear what the signal efficiency of this method is , as reducible backgrounds include @xmath70 and others that might have low rejection rates .",
    "extending the rapidity range has the potential of increasing the statistics and remains an interesting possibility for further study .",
    "in this paper we described an approach for discriminating between various spin hypotheses for a newly discovered @xmath0-channel resonance at the lhc using a centre - edge symmetry , @xmath47 , that is based on the difference of the rapidities of final state fermions .",
    "we also described a simple way to measure the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath2 , using the properties of pseudorapidity .",
    "both of these measurements have an advantage over previous approaches as they rely solely on the measurement of pseudorapidity , a fairly basic quantity .",
    "the new measurements require simple counting and should propagate fewer errors than previous approaches that rely on boosting the four momentum into the centre - of - mass frame in order to perform the analysis .",
