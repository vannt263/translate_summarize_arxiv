    "primordial overdensities seeded , for instance , by inflation or topological defects may collapse to primordial black holes ( pbhs ) during early radiation - dominated eras if they exceed a critical threshold @xcite .",
    "this particular pbh formation process , which is examined in this paper , occurs when an initially super - horizon size region of order unity overdensity crosses into the horizon and recollapses . among the potentially observable consequences of pbhs , should they be produced in cosmologically relevant numbers , are thermal effects due to the hawking evaporation of small pbhs ( manifested in the gamma ray background or as a class of very short gamma ray bursts @xcite ) or purely gravitational effects such as gravitational radiation of coalescing binary pbh systems @xcite or contribution of pbhs to the cosmic density parameter .",
    "upper bounds on these signatures strongly constrain the spectral index of the fluctuation power spectrum on small scales @xcite .",
    "recently , the possibility that stellar mass pbhs constitute halo dark matter has received attention in the context of the macho / eros microlensing detections @xcite . it has been suggested that during the cosmological qcd phase transition , occurring at an epoch where the mass enclosed within the particle horizon , @xmath4 , approximately equals one solar mass , pbh formation may be facilitated due to equation of state effects manifest in a reduction of the pbh formation threshold @xcite .",
    "every quantitative analysis of the pbh number and mass spectrum requires knowledge of the threshold parameter , @xmath5 , ( for the specific definition used here see below ) separating perturbations that form black holes from those that do not , and the resulting black hole mass , @xmath6 , as a function of distance from the threshold . in a simplified picture of the formation process , where hydrodynamical effects are only accounted for in a very approximate way",

    "misner equations are perfectly suited to follow the evolution of a black hole for long times after its initial formation without encountering coordinate singularities .",
    "this allowed us , in principle , to study the accretion onto newly formed pbhs for arbitrarily long times ( in contrast to earlier calculations @xcite ) and therefore predict final pbh masses .",
    "the lagrangian form of the hernandez ",
    "misner equations allows the convenient tracking of the expanding outer regions in a comoving numerical reference frame .",
    "it also provides a simple prescription for the outer boundary condition , as explained below .",

    "numerical accuracy dictates to deviate as little as possible from an equidistant grid partition lest numerical instabilities occurring on superhorizon scales severely constrain the grid size ( see below ) . on the other hand , since @xmath29 in a constant density medium , spatial resolution is concentrated near the outer grid boundary and is worst near the origin ( where it is needed most ) in case of equidistant @xmath30 . as a compromise between accuracy and resolution",
    ", we use an exponentially growing cell size of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a constant and @xmath33 is the total number of grid points .",
    "based on the standard convergence tests for numerical resolution , we used @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the results reported below .",
    "the canonical boundary conditions ( b18 and b40 ) are imposed at the origin , while the outer boundary is defined to match the exact solution of the friedmann equations for a radiation - dominated flat universe .",
    "hence , the pressure follows the analytic solution @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the proper time of the outermost fluid element ( identified here with the frw time coordinate , @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the initial values for pressure and proper time .",
    "the time metric ( lapse ) functions in ( b1 ) and ( b27 ) are fixed at @xmath41 at the outer boundary in order to synchronize the coordinate times @xmath17 and @xmath18 with the proper time of an observer comoving with the outermost fluid element , @xmath37 , and thereby with @xmath42 ( note that b40 synchronizes @xmath18 with a stationary observer at infinity which is a meaningless concept in an expanding space ",

    "explicit numerical experiments showed good agreement of the numerical solution at the outer grid with the exact frw solution for all relevant perturbation parameters if the grid reached out to @xmath46 . extending the grid to these large radii proved to be a non - trivial task for the misner ",
    "sharp part of the numerical scheme , needed to initialize the hernandez  misner computation , as will be outlined below .",
    "as the initial data is most naturally assigned on a spatial hypersurface at constant misner ",

    "misner equations . as a consequence , the misner ",
    "sharp calculation needs to be carried out until an initialization photon starting at the center reaches the outer grid boundary . for the aforementioned reasons ,",
    "it is preferable to use a super - horizon size computational domain . since the light travelling time over such a large grid is larger than the dynamical time for collapse to a pbh ( @xmath48 ) , a black hole already forms during the misner ",

    "much larger than the horizon , however , they become much greater than unity , and thus numerical noise can lead to significant errors in the radial metric function , @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "the positive feedback of errors in @xmath54 , @xmath24 ( b13 ) , and @xmath55 ( b6 ) leads to a numerical instability of the misner ",
    "sharp equations on superhorizon scales .",
    "it can be controlled by solving for @xmath54 , @xmath24 , and @xmath55 at each time step by iteration , and by imposing a very restrictive allowed density change of @xmath56 per time step .",
    "none of the above mentioned problems exist in the hernandez ",
    "misner formulation by virtue of the time slicing along null surfaces : avoidance of the central singularity is guaranteed by the formation of an event horizon , and the superhorizon instability can not occur because every grid point lies , by definition , on the horizon .",
    "therefore , after the assignment of initial data is completed , the integration of the fluid equations in hernandez  misner coordinates is numerically stable for arbitrarily long times and on arbitrarily large spatial domains . in order to achieve reasonable accuracy , however , the time step size must be restricted to values much smaller than the courant - friedrich - levy ( cfl ) condition .",
    "the reason is most likely found in the numerical integration of the lapse function , @xmath20 , which is only first - order accurate @xcite .",
    "this problem is most important for collapse with initial conditions close to the threshold for black hole formation , which leads to the formation of very small black holes and gives rise to very strong space ",

    "the time step generally causes a decrease of resulting black hole mass , @xmath6 . at the numerical resolution chosen for this problem ( see eq . [ grid ] ) , the code is unable to follow the formation of black holes smaller than @xmath57 in units of the initial horizon mass .",
    "an adaptive mesh algorithm may be necessary to resolve this problem . in agreement with studies of critical gravitational collapse ( @xcite ) ,",
    "our experiments indicate that only the coefficient @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) is affected by the time step variation , while the scaling exponent @xmath12 appears very robust .",
    "nevertheless , these problems disappear rapidly with distance to the threshold such that convergence for larger pbh masses was attained .",
    "in addition to the test - bed calculations reported by baumgarte _",
    "et al._@xcite , we verified the accuracy of the code including the modified outer boundary conditions by simulating the evolution of a flat unperturbed universe . using the time step restriction described above",

    "we have studied the spherically symmetric evolution of three families of curvature perturbations .",
    "initial conditions are chosen to be perturbations in the energy density , @xmath16 , in unperturbed hubble flow specified at horizon crossing .",
    "the first family of perturbations is described by a gaussian - shaped overdensity that asymptotically approaches the frw solution at large radii , @xmath59 \\,\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath22 is circumferential radius , @xmath60 is the horizon length at the initial cosmological time @xmath44 , and @xmath61 , yielding @xmath62 for the initial horizon mass of the unperturbed space  time . in the absence of perturbations",
    ", cirumferential radius corresponds to what is commonly referred to as proper distance in cosmology , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath65 is the comoving cosmic distance .",
    "the other two families of initial conditions involve a spherical mexican - hat function and a sixth order polynomial .",
    "these functions are characterized by outer rarefaction regions that exactly compensate for the additional mass of the inner overdensities , so that the mass derived from the integrated density profile is equal to that of an unperturbed frw solution : @xmath66 \\,\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath67   & r < \\sqrt{3 } { r_{\\rm h}}\\\\ \\epsilon_0 & r \\ge \\sqrt{3 } { r_{\\rm h}}\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the amplitude @xmath21 is a free parameter used to tune the initial conditions to sub- or supercriticality with respect to black hole formation .",
    "the shapes of all three perturbations are illustrated in figure ( [ f0 ] ) .    1    the relevant dimensionless threshold parameter , @xmath5 , for the purpose of evaluating the cosmological abundance of pbhs is the energy overdensity in uniform hubble constant gauge averaged over a horizon volume ( i.e. , synchronous gauge with uniform hubble flow condition ) .",
    "it is equivalent to the additional mass - energy inside @xmath68 in units of @xmath69 .",
    "we find similar values  @xmath70 ( mexican - hat ) , @xmath71 ( gaussian ) , and @xmath72 ( polynomial )  for all three families of initial data in our study , suggesting that the value @xmath73 yields a more accurate estimate for the cosmological pbh mass function than the commonly employed @xmath74 .    in cases where a black hole is formed ,",
    "we define its mass , @xmath6 , as the gravitational mass , @xmath55 , enclosed by the innermost shell that conforms to @xmath75 , the temporal evolution of all shells with smaller @xmath20 being essentially frozen in ( with regard to proper time of a distant observer ) . owing to the steep rise of @xmath20 at the event horizon ,",
    "the exact choice of the cutoff value does not affect @xmath6 within the accuracy reported in this work .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we henceforth quote @xmath6 in units of the initial horizon mass , @xmath69 , and proper time in multiples of the initial time , @xmath44 .    figures ( [ f1 ] ) , ( [ f2 ] ) , and ( [ f3 ] ) illustrate generic features of the evolution of slightly supercritical perturbations for the three density perturbation families , respectively .",
    "the curves display the energy density , @xmath76 , at constant proper time , @xmath77 , for each mass shell ( @xmath77 is given in multiples of @xmath44 as labeled ) . in hernandez  misner coordinates , the lack of a well defined global time variable corresponding to the cosmological frw time at infinity requires this local time slicing . as described in @xcite , we integrate d@xmath78d@xmath18 and store @xmath79 together with all other state variables .",
    "the curves are then created by plotting the energy density along the isosurfaces of @xmath77 .",
    "the radial coordinate is the circumferential radius , scaled such that in the absence of a perturbation it may be associated with cosmic comoving radius .",
    "further , the initial horizon size , @xmath60 , is normalized to unity in the figures .",
    "it is interesting to note that with this type of time slicing @xmath80 may cease to be a single - valued function of the circumferential radius , @xmath22 , in cases of strong curvature ( cf .",
    "figure [ f4 ] ) .",
    "in particular , at the same proper time spheres containing larger baryon number ( labeled by @xmath21 ) may have smaller circumferential radius than spheres containing smaller baryon number .    in all cases shown in figures ( [ f1]),([f2 ] ) , and ( [ f3 ] ) , a black hole with @xmath81 forms . the hydrodynamical evolution of the three different perturbations exhibits strong similarities : initially",
    ", the central overdensity grows in amplitude while the outer underdensity , if present in the initial conditions , gradually widens and levels out . a black hole forms in the interior .",
    "some time after the initial formation of an event horizon , material close to the pbh but outside the event horizon bounces and launches a compression wave traveling outward .",
    "this compression wave is connected to the black hole by a rarefaction region that evacuates the immediate vicinity of the black hole .",
    "the strength of the rarefaction differs significantly for the gaussian perturbation shape and the mass compensated ones : while the latter display only a weak underdensity that quickly equilibrates , the former gives rise to a drop in energy density by three orders of magnitude .",
    "the bounce of material outside the newly formed black hole is a feature intrinsic only to black holes very close to the formation threshold .",
    "it effectively shuts off further accretion of material onto the newly formed pbh . as figure ( [ f5 ] ) demonstrates , no bounce occurs if the initial conditions are sufficiently far above the threshold . here , a large black hole ( @xmath82 ) forms whose event horizon reaches further out , encompassing regions where the pressure gradient is smaller , preventing pressure forces from overcoming gravitational attraction . slightly below the pbh formation threshold ,",
    "a bounce occurs whose strength is proportional to the initial perturbation amplitude ( figure [ f4 ] ) , indicating that the fluid bounce is strongest for perturbations very close to the threshold .",
    "it is likely that previous studies @xcite failed to observe this phenomenon because their initial conditions were insufficiently close to the black hole formation threshold .",
    "their numerical simulations may also not have followed the hydrodynamical evolution for long enough after the initial formation of the pbh .",
    "accretion onto pbhs and their resulting growth in mass has been a highly debated subject since the suggestion that pbhs may grow in proportion with the cosmological horizon mass @xcite .",
    "both analytic @xcite and previous numerical studies @xcite came to the conclusion that the growth of pbh masses by ongoing accretion is negligible except , possibly , for very contrived initial data for the perturbations .",
    "our results generally confirm this statement for small pbhs , but we find noticeable differences between collapse simulations that exhibit the fluid bounce and those that do not ( figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "the rarefaction following the outgoing density wave efficiently cuts off the flow of material into the black hole . comparing figures ( [ f6 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] )",
    ", it is recognized that the secondary phase of mass growth for the gaussian shape calculation may correspond to the rise of the second wave crest of the strongly damped density oscillation at the black hole event horizon .",
    "this second rise in density is absent in the weaker bounces of the mexican - hat and polynomial - shaped perturbation simulations .",
    "the large ( @xmath82 ) black hole , on the other hand , continues to grow at a slowly decreasing rate for long times without gaining a considerable amount of mass in the process .",
    "based on these results , we expect accretion to be insignificant for the determination of @xmath6 , at least for the types of perturbations investigated here .",
    "choptuik s discovery @xcite of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse near the black hole formation threshold started an active and fascinating line of research in numerical and analytical general relativity ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "for a variety of matter models , it was found that the dynamics of near - critical collapse exhibits continuous or discrete self - similarity and power law scaling of the black hole mass with the offset from the critical point ( eq . [ scale ] ) . in particular , evans and coleman @xcite found self - similarity and mass scaling in numerical experiments of a collapsing radiation fluid .",
    "they numerically determined the scaling exponent @xmath83 , followed by a linear perturbation analysis of the critical solution by koike _",
    "et al._@xcite that yielded @xmath84 .    until recently",
    ", it was believed that entering the scaling regime requires a degree of fine - tuning of the initial data that is unnatural for any astrophysical application .",
    "it was noted @xcite that fine - tuning to criticality occurs naturally in the case of pbhs forming from a steeply declining distribution of primordial density fluctuations , as generically predicted by inflationary scenarios . in the radiation - dominated cosmological epoch ,",
    "the only difference with the fluid collapse studied numerically by evans and coleman @xcite is the asymptotically expanding , finite density background space ",
    "time of a frw universe . assuming that self - similarity and mass scaling are consequences of an intermediate asymptotic solution that is independent of the asymptotic boundary conditions , eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) is applicable to pbh masses , allowing the derivation of a universal pbh initial mass function @xcite .",
    "furthermore , cosmological constraints based on evaporating pbhs are slightly modified as a consequence of the production of not only horizon - size pbhs , as previously assumed , but the additional production of smaller , sub - horizon mass black holes at each epoch @xcite .",
    "figure ( [ f7 ] ) presents numerical evidence that mass scaling according to eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) occurs in the collapse of near - critical black holes in an asymptotic frw space ",
    "time , and therefore applies to pbh formation .",
    "all three perturbation families give rise to scaling solutions with a scaling exponent @xmath85 .",
    "only the smallest six black holes of all families were included to obtain the numerical best fit quoted in the figure captions .",
    "on larger mass scales , deviations from mass scaling with a fixed exponent become noticeable ; in all cases , @xmath12 tends to increase slightly for larger @xmath6 .",
    "owing to resolution limitations discussed in section ( [ numerics ] ) , we were unable to compute the formation of smaller black holes than the ones shown in figure ( [ f7 ] ) .    to linear order , the scaling relation ( [ scale ] ) is invariant under transformations of the control parameter @xmath2 up to a change of the coefficient @xmath11 .",
    "this was tested explicitly by choosing different definitions of @xmath2 ( the perturbation amplitude @xmath21 , the total excess mass for the gaussian - shaped perturbation , and the excess mass within the horizon volume ) for the numerical fit and obtaining identical values for @xmath12 .",

    "times very close to the threshold of black hole formation embedded in an expanding frw solution .",
    "if the initial perturbation is smaller than @xmath5 , it grows until pressure forces at the origin cause the fluid to bounce , creating an outgoing pressure wave followed by a rarefaction , but no black hole .",
    "initial conditions slightly exceeding the threshold , on the other hand , lead to the formation of a very small black hole at the origin ; however , the pressure gradient immediately outside of the event horizon is still sufficiently steep to force the fluid to bounce",
    ". the launch of a compression wave can be observed in simulations of all three perturbation shapes .",
    "it is strongest in the case of a pure initial overdensity , parameterized here as a gaussian curve , where the density behind the pressure wave drops by three orders of magnitude .",
    "increasing @xmath2 to values significantly above @xmath5 , the bounce becomes weaker and finally disappears , signaling the failure of the pressure gradient at the event horizon to overcome gravitational attraction .",
    "this behavior has important consequences for the accretion onto pbhs immediately after their formation .",
    "if a bounce occurs , the inner rarefaction shuts off accretion almost completely before any significant amount of material has been accreted .",
    "on the other hand , black holes that form from sufficiently large overdensities , where a bounce is suppressed , may accrete at a slowly decreasing rate for a long time .",
    "since most pbhs created from collapsing primordial density fluctuations with a steeply declining amplitude distribution form very close to @xmath5 @xcite , we conclude that accretion is unimportant for the estimation of pbh masses .",

    "finally , the previously suggested @xcite scaling relation between @xmath6 and @xmath10 , based on the analogy with critical phenomena observed in near - critical black hole collapse in asymptotically non - expanding space  times @xcite , was confirmed numerically for an asymptotic frw background . for the smallest black holes in our investigation",

    "<S> furthermore , the scaling of black hole mass with distance from the formation threshold , known to occur in near - critical gravitational collapse , is demonstrated to apply to primordial black hole formation . </S>"
