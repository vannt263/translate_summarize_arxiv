    "it is commonly appreciated that the ultracold regime of collisions occurs when only a small number of partial waves contributes to scattering .",
    "this is a sensible criterion for atoms interacting via van der waals forces , where the wigner threshold laws dictate that scattering phase shifts scale linearly with wave number @xmath0 for @xmath1-wave collisions , but diminish as higher powers of @xmath0 for higher partial waves @xcite . for atoms or molecules scattering via dipolar forces",
    ", however , this criterion fails , since the threshold phase shifts for _ all _ nonzero partial waves scale linearly in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus in principle a large number of partial waves may be necessary to describe scattering of polar species even in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to describe the scattering of polar species directly in coordinate space , rather than in terms of angular momentum quantum numbers . in this article",
    "we derive the relevant differential cross sections within the born approximation .",
    "this approach directly reveals the angular structure of the scattering , including the fact that , for polarized molecules , the differential cross section depends on the incident angle as well as the scattering angle .",
    "we show that the partial wave series version of the born approximation formally converges to the correct angular distribution , but that the convergence may be extremely slow .",
    "we illustrate the influence of the anisotropy of scattering by using it to calculate the rate of rethermalization in a classical gas that has been brought out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "while dipole interactions are now well - known to influence the behavior of quantum degenerate bose gases @xcite , we illustrate here a significant effect of the anisotropy of collision in a thermal ( but still ultracold ) gas .",
    "these results have implications for collisions and especially for evaporative cooling of polar molecules or highly magnetic atoms such as dysprosium @xcite and erbium @xcite .",
    "for the sake of concreteness , we will speak of polar molecules polarized in an electric field @xmath2 , although the results apply equally to magnetic atoms polarized in a magnetic field .",
    "these molecules interact via the dipole potential ( in cgs units ) @xmath3 here @xmath4 are the molecular dipole moments , @xmath5 is the relative coordinate joining them , and @xmath6 is a reduced spherical harmonic @xcite . writing",
    "the interaction in this way assumes that the electric - field direction coincides with the laboratory @xmath7-axis .",
    "this orientation simplifies the derivation of the cross section , but subsequently the cross section will be cast in a coordinate - independent form . in the final expression on the right of ( [ dipole_potential ] )",
    "we employ a single dipole moment @xmath8 as if the molecules were the same .",
    "more generally , the replacement @xmath9 can be made , if the dipoles are different .",
    "the hamiltonian describing scattering of the molecules , in their center - of - mass frame , is @xmath10 where , as usual , @xmath11 stands for the reduced mass of the collision partners . in ( [ hamiltonian ] )",
    "we allow for an additional short - range interaction @xmath12 that can describe an @xmath1-wave phase shift not already accounted for by the dipole potential .",
    "it is convenient to convert the scattering problem into dipole units , where the natural length and energy scales are , respectively , @xmath13 cast in these units , the schrdinger equation reads @xmath14",
    "\\psi = \\epsilon \\psi,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the collision energy in reduced units .",
    "scattering in three dimensions is characterized by a differential cross section that relates the wave vector @xmath16 of the molecules initial approach to one another , to the wave vector @xmath17 into which they scatter : @xmath18 written , as is conventional , in terms of a scattering amplitude @xmath19 .",
    "the total scattering cross section is then @xmath20 which for dipoles can depend on the orientation of the incident direction @xmath16 with respect to the polarization axis .    in the case of indistinguishable bosons or fermions , symmetry places constraints on the scattering amplitudes .",
    "specifically , the amplitude for scattering from a given incident direction @xmath16 must by properly symmetrized with respect to two opposing scattering directions @xmath21 , @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the resulting cross sections are then @xcite latexmath:[\\ ] ] doing so complicates the integration considerably , since the magnitude of @xmath182 is a function of the direction @xmath175 . nevertheless , in the limit of large @xmath83 , @xmath183 and the integrand scales as @xmath184 , which leads to a convergent integral .",
    "this simple exercise points to a general caution : when going beyond the first born approximation for dipolar scattering , it will be necessary to treat in some realistic fashion the short - range physics of the interaction potential .",
    "reduction of the collision energy to the ultracold regime , as always , simplifies the theoretical description of scattering . for",
    "dipolar particles , however , this simplification does _ not _ reduce to isotropy of scattering , as it does for nondipolar particles .",
    "rather , the differential cross section is a somewhat nontrivial function of both the incident and scattered wave vectors , of the direction of polarization of the dipoles , and of the interplay between all three directions . to describe this scattering ,",
    "we have demonstrated that it is useful to employ the direct expressions ( [ f_unsymmetrized],[f_symmetrized ] ) , rather than slowly converging partial wave expansions .",
    "the isotropy that persists down to the ultracold regime has consequences for the rearrangement of energy due to collisions .",
    "we have shown that this anisotropy can have a profound influence on the rate of rethermalization of a gas taken out of equilibrium , since scattering at the required scattering angles can be made more or less favorable by adjusting the direction of the electric or magnetic field .",
    "thus even a thermal , non - quantum - degenerate gas , at ultracold temperatures , may be expected to exhibit strong anisotropy if its constituent particles are dipolar .",
