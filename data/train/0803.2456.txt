    "the complete set of the solutions of the coulomb two - centre ( ctc ) problem is widely used as a basis for the representation of the coulomb three - body ( ctb ) wave function for a long time ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the most attractive features of that basis is its simplicity .",
    "first , due to the high symmetry of the coulomb field , the ctc problem admits the separation of variables , and the basis elements are the completely factorized functions .",
    "second , the co - factors composing the basis elements , so - called coulomb spheroidal functions ( csf ) , are the well investigated functions related to the heun class .",
    "the principal results on csf and the references are presented in @xcite-@xcite .    the traditional way to use the ctc basis for",
    "the analysis of the ctb system with positive and negative charges ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) is the adiabatic representation @xcite which is known also as the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approach , the perturbed stationary states method , the molecular orbitals method . in that approach the distance @xmath15 between the particles 1 and 2",
    "is considered as an adiabatic parameter , and the basis functions are orthogonal at fixed @xmath15 .",
    "the numerous helpful properties of csf allow to construct the effective numerical algorithms for the calculation of bound states and cross sections of elastic and inelastic collisions for various ctb systems .",
    "the method is successfully used not only for the case of heavy particles 1,2 and a light particle 3 @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , but as well for light particles 1,2 ( electrons ) and a heavy particle 3 ( nucleus ) @xcite-@xcite .    nevertheless , the bo representation in the traditional form ( i.e. with @xmath15 as a parameter ) has a well - known imperfection which decreases the efficiency of the calculations of the scattering processes .",
    "the point is that the bo expansion is not coordinated with the physical boundary conditions of the scattering problem .",
    "it means that at @xmath16 the wave function of the scattering particles in any open channel is formed as the sum of the infinite number of components , the selected terms of the bo series calculated at large @xmath15 .",
    "that sum includes , in particular , the basis functions tending at large @xmath15 to the atomic wave functions of the closed channels .",
    "thus , the terms of the bo expansion , generally speaking , are not divided into the groups corresponding to open and closed channels .",
    "the peculiarity pointed out becomes apparent in the system of radial equations : the matrix elements coupling different basis states may remain nonzero at large @xmath15 .",
    "that leads to the complication of the boundary conditions for the radial functions at @xmath16 @xcite and to the slow convergence of the expansion .",
    "the incoordination of the adiabatic representation with the physical boundary conditions of the three - body ( not necessary coulomb ) scattering problem is peculiar to both the quantum approach and the semiclassical one . to overcome the difficulties in the frames of the semiclassical treatment the inclusion of `` electron translation factors ''",
    "is used @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the various methods of the improvement of the adiabatic representation for the scattering processes are developed also in the quantum approach ( @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast to the traditional bo representation the adiabatic hyperspherical ( ahs ) one @xcite-@xcite is coordinated with the boundary conditions of the three - body scattering problem . in that approach",
    "the hyperradius @xmath11 is used as an adiabatic parameter .",
    "the wave function of any open channel is the asymptotics of the single , corresponding to that channel , term of the expansion .",
    "the ahs approach is successfully applied to the calculations of the bound states , the cross sections of the elastic and inelastic collisions and the resonances in various ctb systems @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .    however , the ahs basis elements are the essentially more complicated functions than the bo ones . in the general case",
    "they are the non - factorized functions of five independent variables .",
    "in addition , for the coulomb three - body systems the ahs energy terms as functions of @xmath11 have the numerous avoiding crossings which make difficulties for the numerical calculations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these avoiding crossings are closely connected with the exact crossings of the ctc adiabatic terms @xcite .",
    "thus , in the ahs approach the high symmetry of the coulomb field , instead of the simplification , paradoxically leads to the additional difficulties .",
    "the avoiding crossings are removed in the original version of the hyperspherical approach developed in papers @xcite-@xcite . in these papers",
    "the basis completely factorizing in the special four - pole elliptic coordinates on the hypersphere is suggested .",
    "the co - factors composing the basis elements in that approach are essentially more complicated functions as compared with csf , they relate to the heun class only at zero energy @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to obtain the representation of the ctb wave function which , on the one hand , contains only the well - known csf and , on the other hand , is coordinated with the boundary conditions of the scattering problem at energies below the threshold of the three - particle breakup . in other words , to obtain the representation combining the advantages of the ahs approach ( the coordination with the boundary conditions ) and the advantages connected with the specific character of the coulomb field ( the complete factorization of the basis and the simplicity of its components , csf ) . that task is interesting , firstly , for the development of the efficient computing methods and , secondly , for the completeness of the theoretical description of csf : it is desirable to present various ways to use these well - known functions in the ctb problem .",
    "the above goal is achieved in the paper with the help of the new relation between the parameters of csf and the internal coordinates of the ctb system .",
    "the suggested ctc basis functions , just as the ahs basis functions , form the orthogonal set on the sphere @xmath4 in the three - dimensional space of the internal variables , in place of the surface @xmath17 appearing in the traditional bo approach .",
    "the difference of our expansion from the traditional bo one can be outlined briefly for the simplest case of zero total angular momentum , @xmath18 , in the following way .",
    "let @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 be the position vectors of the particles in the centre - of - mass frame @xmath22 in the case @xmath18 the three - body wave function @xmath23 depends on three independent internal variables , for example @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath15 : @xmath26    in the traditional bo approach three independent variables are , in fact , @xmath15 and the prolate spheroidal coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath28 $ ] defined by the relations @xmath29 the variable @xmath15 is considered as a parameter of the basis , and the decomposition of the three - body wave function has the form @xmath30 where the basis functions @xmath31 are the factorized solutions of the ctc problem with the intercentre distance @xmath15 .",
    "these solutions as the functions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 form the complete orthogonal system at fixed @xmath15 .    in our approach",
    "the independent variables are @xmath6 , @xmath7 and the hyperradius @xmath32 it is considered as the parameter of the basis .",

    "basis functions @xmath35 are the factorized solutions of the ctc problem with the modified charges and the intercentre distance proportional to the hyperradius @xmath11 .",
    "they form the complete orthogonal system at fixed @xmath11 and coincide ( up to a constant factor ) with @xmath31 at large @xmath15 .    in the case",
    "@xmath36 the basis suggested consists of the productions of csf and the symmetrized wigner functions .",
    "we call it `` the hyperspherical coulomb spheroidal ( hscs ) basis '' .",
    "the formulae are more complicated but the principal idea is the same .",
    "the principal notations and the starting equations are presented in section 2 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the construction of the hscs basis . in section 4 the definition of @xmath37-matrix in the appropriate representation",
    "is presented , and the asymptotical expressions for the radial functions in terms of the matrix elements of @xmath37-matrix are obtained .",

    "however , the principal term of the asymptotics of the diagonal matrix element @xmath297 is obtained without any complicated calculations : @xmath298 other matrix elements in vanish at @xmath124 .    to find the matrix @xmath266 one has to solve the system for the real radial functions @xmath299 for all sets @xmath300 ( the input channel ) corresponding to open channels .",

    "the suggested hscs representation is coordinated with the boundary conditions of the scattering problem like the ahs one but the hscs basis functions are essentially simpler .",
    "the combination of the simplicity and the coordination mentioned is achieved at the price of the deviation from the adiabatic idea and the corresponding complication of the radial equations .",
    "indeed , the ctc hamiltonian @xmath120 generating our basis functions differs from the ahs hamiltonian @xmath105 by both the potential energy and the kinetic one .",
    "therefore the radial system contains the non - diagonal matrices @xmath305 and @xmath306 instead of the diagonal matrix of @xmath105 in the ahs approach .",
    "that complication , however , looks insignificant as compared with the advantages resulting from the properties of the hscs expansion .",
    "first , all calculations are simplified .",
    "second , the avoided crossings of the ahs terms are changed by the exact crossings of the ctc terms .",
    "third , the use of the well - known and relatively simple csf allows to perform the precise calculations in a wide range of @xmath11 including extremely large values which are essential for the calculation of @xmath37-matrix .",
    "these theoretical reasons need , of course , the practical verification .",
    "the essential difference between hscs and ahs expansions is that the first one includes both discrete and continuous spectra while the second one has a pure discrete spectrum . in the ahs approach ( as well as in the approach of papers @xcite - @xcite ) every basis function at large @xmath11 is localized in the vicinity of the coalescent point where it coincides with the wave function of the bound state of the corresponding atom .",
    "thus , that basis is not suitable for the representation of the ctb wave function at energies above the threshold of the three - particle breakup .",
    "in contrast to the ahs basis , the hscs one includes the functions which are not localized in the vicinities of the coalescent points at any @xmath11 .",
    "that allows to hope that the hscs basis can be used for the adequate representation of the ctb wave function at energies above the threshold mentioned .",
    "the method suggested , by analogy with the adiabatic hyperspherical approach , can be named `` the diabatic hyperspherical approach '' as the avoided crossings of the ahs terms correspond to the exact crossings of the ctc terms . in this connection",
    "it is interesting to develop the semiclassical version of the hscs approach .",
    "it is interesting also to apply the hscs expansion to the calculation of the bound states of the ctb systems . that problem is simpler than the scattering one as all radial functions vanish at @xmath124 .    the applied three - pole coordinate system on the sphere @xmath4 which is connected with the elliptic coordinate system on the plane by means of the stereographic projection may be interesting for other three - body problems in the hyperspherical approach as it presents the natural way to take into consideration three coalescent points of the three - body system .",
