    "in weak turbulence , wave trains which have different directions of the propagation , wavelengths , and frequencies weakly interact with each other owing to the nonlinearity in the governing equation and/or the boundary conditions .",
    "many papers on weak turbulence have been devoted to the derivation of the kinetic equation  @xcite , which governs the statistical evolution of the wave action spectrum , the physical and mathematical properties of the kinetic equation and resulting spectra  @xcite , the statistically steady non - equilibrium spectra when the external forces and the dissipation balances  @xcite , and so on .",
    "thus , researches on weak turbulence have been conventionally focused on the wave action spectrum , which is the ensemble average of the squared norm of the complex amplitude of each mode  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the spectra which are observed in the direct numerical simulations ( dns ) and field observations have large fluctuations . in dns",
    ", the amplitude of each wave mode is often determined by a prescribed spectrum and initially have no fluctuations at all . even in such dns ,",
    "the amplitude fluctuations spontaneously grow as time elapses .",
    "the generation mechanism of the fluctuations , the time scales of their growths , and the possibility of the approach to the gaussianity had little been studied .",
    "the random phase and amplitude formalism ( rpa ) which has recently been developed has changed the situation , and drastically extended the scope of weak turbulence research  @xcite .",
    "similar to the conventional weak turbulence theory , rpa is the statistical theory for the complex amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath0 be expressed as @xmath1 with the positive amplitude @xmath2 and the phase factor @xmath3 . in the random phase approximation ( rp ) in the strict sense",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath4 for all @xmath5 are independent random variables and are uniformly distributed over the unit circle in the complex plane . in the random phase and amplitude formalism it is assumed , in addition to the assumptions of rp , that the amplitude @xmath2 also are mutually independent random variables for all @xmath5 .",
    "it is important to note that in rpa @xmath2 is allowed to have any distribution and can be far from the gaussianity . although it is only recently that rpa is defined unambiguously , it has implicitly been used for a rather long time under the name of the random phase approximation `` , often without being realized of it . for example , zakharov et al .",
    "( @xcitep.65 ) calls their approximation the random phase approximation '' , but they implicitly assume the statistical independence of the amplitude @xmath2 for different @xmath5 .",
    "the equations which describe the time evolution of the moments of @xmath6 for arbitrary orders as well as the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath6 have been derived .",
    "thus , rpa is expected to describe the statistical characteristics of the amplitude fluctuations , which have little been studied .",
    "although rpa seems to have a great potential capability , its validity has been assessed neither numerically nor experimentally . in this study",
    ", we perform a series of large - scale dns for a model hamiltonian system which allows three - wave resonance , and compare the results with the theoretical predictions of rpa . here",
    "we confine our attention to the single - mode statistics of the amplitude fluctuations . in every aspect studied here",
    ", we have obtained good quantitative agreement between rpa and dns .",
    "benney and newell  @xcite investigated the @xmath7th order cumulant @xmath8 of a wave turbulence field in the physical space , and derived an equation which governs the temporal evolution of the fourier transform of @xmath8 .",
    "they assumed that the wave field is weak nonlinear and that the medium is dispersive , but did not assume that the wave field is close to a gaussian state in the physical space .",
    "prior to @xcite , benney and saffman  @xcite derived the kinetic equation for the action spectrum based on the same assumptions . in the present paper , we will compare our numerical results with the predictions of rpa only , and will not try any comparison with the predictions of @xcite mainly from the following two reasons .",
    "firstly , @xcite is described in terms of the fourier transform of a real - valued physical variable , and it is not expressed in terms of the complex amplitude of wave modes which we want to handle . secondly , @xcite does not introduce the discretization of the @xmath5 space and the fourier transform is a generalized function . on the other hand",
    ", rpa treats the discretized @xmath5 space from the outset , hence the comparison with dns is straightforward and much easier than the case of @xcite .",
    "there is also an essential difference between rpa and the analysis in @xcite,@xcite with regard to the speed of decay of the correlations in the physical space as functions of the separation of points .",

    "although the time rate of the spectral change for the first @xmath214 is slightly different from the prediction of the kinetic equation , the rate during the period @xmath214 from @xmath215 to @xmath216 almost perfectly coincides with the prediction of the kinetic equation . the time rates of change of the higher - order moments during @xmath214 also show similar agreements between dns and rpa . these agreements between dns and rpa in the short - time evolution appears to contradict the procedure of the derivation of the statistical equations in rpa .",
