    "theoretical understanding of experimentally measured neutrino anomalies poses a major challenge to unified gauge theories especially since @xmath4 mixing has been observed to be close to maximal through atmospheric neutrino flux measurements whereas the mixing in the corresponding quark sector is small .",
    "the problem is so severe that , only over the limited span of the last two years , nearly a hundred models have been proposed where considerable effort has been devoted to accommodate large neutrino mixing @xcite .",
    "there are also interesting suggestions to understand this large mixing in the context of various grand unified theories including @xmath5 @xcite , which unify both quarks and leptons .",
    "it is however fair to say that no convincing and widely accepted natural model has yet emerged .    with a view to simplifying model building",
    ", we recently suggested criteria for radiative magnification of neutrino mixing@xcite which allow a small mixing at high scale to be amplified to large mixing at the weak scale after renormalization group evolution .",
    "the only condition that needs to be fulfilled is that the @xmath1 and @xmath2 be quasi - degenerate in mass , as for example would be independently required if lsnd results are confirmed . in such models , there is no need to impose special constraints on the theory at high scale beyond those needed to guarantee the quasi - degeneracy .",
    "they would , therefore , require less theoretical input compared to the case where one tries to obtain both degeneracy ( should it be phenomenologically warranted ) and maximal mixing at the high ( seesaw ) scale within the framework of quark lepton unification .    a key role in the above scenario is played by the renormalization group equations for neutrino masses and mixings @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we exploit one of the most interesting and highly appealing aspect of renormalisation group ( rg ) running of gauge and yukawa couplings i.e.  the emergence of fixed point ( fp ) structure .",
    "use of fp structure of rge s to understand low energy parameters is not new ; for example , it is often invoked @xcite to understand the top quark mass at the weak scale starting with a wider range of possible values at the gut scale as would be preferred by the naturalness requirement in gut theories .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that neutrino mixings can have fixed points corresponding to maximal mixing and several examples were given to illustrate this point in the standard model and two higgs model .",
    "the desirable value of @xmath6 were shown to arise in these models both at the electroweak and at intermediate scales of order @xmath7 gev or so depending on the model parameters at the high scale .",
    "our goal in the present work is to extend the discussion of @xcite to supersymmetric theories ( mssm ) and delineate the constraints on the high scale theory under which the fixed point ( or maximal mixing ) occurs around the weak scale .",
    "we discuss the conditions under which the value of the mixing remains stable as the energy is varied from tev to @xmath8 scale . a crucial requirement for the fixed point to occur",
    "is that the muon and the tau neutrinos must be quasi - degenerate .",
    "our analysis further clarifies the idea of radiative magnification discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we the point out that in a special class of models which extend this idea to the case of three degenerate neutrinos , then searches for neutrinoless double beta decay can provide a test of these models .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we discuss radiative correction and derivation of rges for mixing angle in the standard model ( sm ) and minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we obtain analytic solution for the rge and demonstrate explicitly the renormalisation group fixed point ( rgfp ) structure . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we show how the fp occurs naturally at the weak scale for quasidegenerate neutrinos leading to the condition of radiative magnification .",
    "we also derive a new stability criterion and show how the fp and magnification occur in mssm starting from small mixings as in the quark sector . in section [ sec5 ] ,",
    "we comment on tests of the radiative magnification scheme in neutrinoless double beta decay searches .",
    "in both sm and mssm , we consider radiative corrections in the flavor basis to the light majorana neutrino mass matrix , @xmath9 , which is a 5-dim operator scaled by the high mass , @xmath10 ( e.g. see - saw or r.h .",

    "we work in the charged lepton diagonal basis where the unitary matrix @xmath17 that transforms mass basis to flavor basis is identified as the standard mns matrix @xcite . using ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) ,",
    "the mass matrix is evolved from the high scale down to @xmath18 in the sm or mssm .",

    "as was noted in @xcite , both the rges have one trivial fixed point at @xmath26 and the other nontrivial fixed point at @xmath27 .",
    "recently the fp structure of mns matrix has been also investigated in @xcite .",
    "assuming that the initial high - scale texture of the mass matrix is such that the nontrivial fixed point occurs at a scale @xmath28 , we have the fp condition , 2t(t_c)=1  , [ eq10]or , equivalently , m_(t_c)=m_(t_c )  .[eq11 ]",
    "before obtaining analytic solutions to ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) , it is worthwhile to explain why resonance structures in the numerical solutions @xcite in the @xmath29 vs.  @xmath25 plots are expected for specific textures of @xmath30 .    noting that , |y_(t)|^2|y_(t)|^2[eq12]([eq5 ] ) states that in mssm , as @xmath25 decreases below @xmath31 , the ratio , @xmath32 , decreases faster from its high scale value , @xmath33 , as compared to the rate of decrease of the ratio , @xmath34 . in particular , the relations ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) are satisfied at @xmath35 if m_^0e^2_(t_c)=m_^0  .[eq13]for the fp to occur at @xmath36 , the high scale texture must be such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are comparable but unequal with @xmath39 .",
    "lower values of @xmath40 corresponds to larger differences between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    from ( [ eq9 ] )",
    "it is clear that when @xmath41 , the slope of the curve in the @xmath29 vs.  @xmath25 plot vanishes at @xmath35 . for @xmath42 , @xmath43 ,",
    "the slope is negative ; but for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the slope is positive as given by the rge .",
    "negative(positive ) slope to the right(left ) with vanishing slope at @xmath35 is the characteristic feature of a resonance curve as predicted by ( [ eq9 ] ) for mssm .",
    "similar result emerges for sm from ( [ eq8 ] ) with somewhat different high - scale condition with @xmath46 and the ratios @xmath47 and @xmath48 increase as @xmath25 decreases below @xmath31 .",
    "thus it is clear that for certain given textures at high scale @xmath49 and @xmath50 resonance occurs at @xmath35 converting small mixing at high scale to large mixing at lower scales .",
    "inspite of the terse nature of the rhs of ( [ eq9 ] ) , using the almost exact approximation , @xmath51 , we have integrated it to obtain analytic solution for rg evolution of @xmath52 in the mssm for all values of @xmath53 , 2t(t)=2t_0e^2_(t )  , [ eq14]where , @xmath54 , is the high scale mixing angle with 2_0=2(- )  .[eq15 ] + given , m_(t)/m_(t)&=&(/ ) e^2_(t)e^-2 _ ( t )  , + m_(t)/m_(t)&=&(/ ) e^_(t)e^- _ ( t )  , and using ( [ eq5])-([eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) may be recognised as the approximation , @xmath55 , to the following exact analytic solution of ( [ eq9 ] ) , 2t(t)=2t_0e^2_(t)e^2_(t )  .[eq16]replacing @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , formulas ( [ eq14 ] ) or ( [ eq16 ] ) can be used to derive @xmath60 from @xmath61 or vice versa for all values of @xmath62 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these analytic solutions exhibit both the resonance as well as the nontrivial fp structure explicitly .",
    "while detailed features of resonance such as the @xmath25-dependent width , maximal mixing at the peak , and smaller mixings for @xmath42 or @xmath44 are clearly exhibited , the fp structure is proved as follows . at @xmath35 ,",
    "when ( [ eq11 ] ) or ( [ eq13 ] ) are satisfied , the quantity inside the parenthesis in the denominator of ( [ eq16 ] ) or ( [ eq14 ] ) vanishes .",
    "then using ( [ eq15 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq16 ] ) give 2t(t_c)=2t_0=2t_0+^22_0=1  .[eq17]it is to be noted that ( [ eq17 ] ) holds for all initial value of @xmath63 , thus demonstrating the fixed point behavior corresponding to maximal mixing . although the relation ( [ eq17 ] ) appears to be true also for @xmath64 showing that maximal mixing remains maximal at @xmath35 , the rg evolution equations never satisfy @xmath41 for @xmath65 if we start with the initial condition @xmath66 which is necessary for @xmath64 .",
    "in fact nearly maximal mixings at the high scale are damped out to small mixings at lower scales @xmath67 due to nonvanishing contributions of the quantity @xmath68 in the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq14 ] ) or ( [ eq16 ] ) .",
    "thus the analytic formula , apart from demonstrating the fp structure and resonance behavior , also explains why large mixing at high scales are damped out to small mixings near the weak scale . also zero",
    "mixing angle does not run and continues to be zero down to @xmath69 .",
    "similar analytic solutions are also obtained for sm exhibiting the fp structure with the replacement @xmath70 , @xmath71 in ( [ eq14])-([eq16 ] ) .    in almost all cases of rg fixed point",
    "discussed so far in the literature , the fp structure is revealed through the differential rges and demonstrated through numerical solutions only .",
    "but in the present case , apart from the differential rge and numerical solutions ( see section [ sec4 ] ) , the analytic solutions also exhibit the fp structure explicitly as demonstrated through ( [ eq14])-([eq17 ] ) .",
    "when the condition ( [ eq10 ] ) or ( [ eq11 ] ) is satisfied for @xmath72(@xmath73susy scale ) , the fp may manifest as large neutrino mixing observed at low energies , for example , in @xmath4 oscillation scenario necessary to solve the atmospheric neutrino anomaly . in terms of the high scale mass eigen values @xmath74 , mixing angle @xmath75 , and radiative correction parameters , the condition for fp manifestation at @xmath76 then reduces to ( m_2 ^ 0-m_3 ^ 0)c_2_0=2_(t_s)(m_2 ^ 0s^2__0 + m_3 ^ 0c^2__0)-2_(t_s)(m_2 ^ 0c^2__0 + m_3 ^ 0s^2__0 )  .[eq18]where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . taking @xmath81 , this is recognised exactly as the condition that was derived in @xcite for magnifying small mixing at high scale to large mixing at low - energies through radiative corrections .",
    "but , as noted here , the condition is exact , needs no fine tuning , and emerges as a natural consequence of the manifestation of the fp at the weak scale . for small mixing angles at @xmath11 , similar to those existing in the quark sector ( e.g.  @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ,",
    "it is clear that the condition ( [ eq18 ] ) can not be satisfied if the masses @xmath85 and @xmath86 are hierarchial , or exactly degenerate having the same @xmath87 or opposite cp - parity @xmath88 .",
    "also it can not be satisfied if the masses are quasidegenerate with opposite cp - parity @xmath89 .",
    "it can be satisfied only if the masses are quasidegenerate at the high scale having the same cp - parity @xmath90 . since @xmath91 is negative , a necessary prediction of mssm is that @xmath92 . in the sm , @xmath93 and @xmath94 in ( [ eq18 ] )",
    "are replaced by @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , and ( [ eq18 ] ) predicts @xmath97 .",
    "these requirements in mssm or sm are analogous to the occurrence of quasi fixed points in top - quark yukawa coupling where right order of the top quark mass is obtained only for certain strong interaction couplings .",
    "we emphasize that the observed large neutrino mixing in the @xmath4 sector predicts the corresponding @xmath98 masses to be quasidegenerate with the same cp - parity as a necessary requirement in order that the fp manifests at the lower scale . under the condition ( [ eq11 ] ) , with @xmath99 , the mass eigen values at @xmath100 are m_2(t_s)&=&(m_2 ^ 0c__0 ^ 2+m^0_3s__0 ^ 2 ) ( 1 + 2_(t_s))-(m_3 ^ 0-m_2 ^ 0)c__0s__0 ( 1+_(t_s)+_(t_s ) )  .[eq19 ] + m_3(t_s)&=&(m_2 ^ 0c__0 ^ 2+m^0_3s__0 ^ 2 ) ( 1 + 2_(t_s))+(m_3 ^ 0-m_2 ^ 0)c__0s__0 ( 1+_(t_s)+_(t_s ) )  .[eq20]taking the high scale mixings to be small , we obtain the mass squared difference at @xmath100 , m^2m_3 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2 ^ 2s_2_0 ( 1+_(t_s ) )  , [ eq21]where , ^22m_2 ^ 0 ^ 2(e^-2 _ (",
    "t_s)-1)-4m_2 ^ 0 ^ 2_(t_s )  .[eq22 ]    before proceeding further , we show analytically how the stability of radiative magnification is controlled by the high - scale mixing angle . to generate nearly maximal mixing at a lower scale @xmath101 starting from small mixing as in the quark sector at the high scale ( e.g.  @xmath102 ) , the fp position is desired to be stable near @xmath81 .",
    "as the fp is a consequence of radiative corrections , the stability must be guaranteed against smaller changes in the neutrino mass matrix due to higher order corrections .",
    "to maintain such stability this requires the mixing to be nearly maximal within at least @xmath103 few @xmath104 .",
    "in fact we show that radiative stability is ensured over a larger range .",
    "we define the range , @xmath105 to @xmath106 @xmath107 to @xmath108 , within which , the mixing remains nearly maximal . noting that , _",

    "[ eq25]the stability criterion for the fp position and radiative magnification at @xmath111 may be stated as ( ) ^21  .[eq26]this clearly has the implication that arbitrarily small values of high - scale mixing can not maintain a stable fp whereas zero initial mixing continues to remain zero at all lower values of @xmath25 and is never magnified . for smaller values of @xmath54 or @xmath112 ,",
    "the contribution of the third term in the denominator in ( [ eq25 ] ) becomes larger leading to sharper decrease of the predicted low - scale mixing angle from its maximal fixed point value .",
    "this results in the smaller width of the resonance for smaller values of high - scale mixing ( @xmath54 or @xmath112 ) .",
    "this feature is clearly exhibited through figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , where we have presented @xmath113 for @xmath114 gev-@xmath115 tev taking @xmath81 , @xmath116 gev , @xmath117 and @xmath118 with @xmath119 . the high - scale parameters for fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are @xmath120 ev , @xmath121 ev , and @xmath122 ev corresponding to @xmath123 consistent with @xmath124 ev@xmath125 needed for atmospheric neutrino data . for fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] these parameters are @xmath126 ev , @xmath127 ev , and @xmath128 ev corresponding to @xmath129 consistent with @xmath130 ev@xmath125 .",
    "it is clear that in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the width is substantially narrower than fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and @xmath131 reduces by nearly @xmath132 from its maximal value over the range of @xmath133 gev .",
    "such energy dependent mixing between the two neutrinos , as a prediction of mssm when both the fp and the susy scale are at @xmath81 might be possible to testify or falsify in future by high - energy neutrino experiments .",
    "in contrast to the energy dependent mixing discussed above , for the first time we find here a very attractive new feature of the other class of mssm with higher susy scale @xmath134(tev ) where stable and almost energy independent mixing , close to its maximal value , is predicted over a wider range of energy scale @xmath69-few tev starting from the high - scale mixing similar to the quark sector , @xmath135 . using the technique explained above , the high - scale parameters are chosen to have the rg fixed point at the susy scale @xmath136 or few tev .",
    "then the origin of negligible energy dependence in the predicted mixing at all lower energy scales is explained by noting the nonsusy sm prediction for which @xmath137 below @xmath138 ,    @xmath139 , 2t()&=&2t(m_s)(m_s)^y_^216 ^ 2(m_(m_s ) ( m_s)^y_^216 ^ 2-m_(m_s))^2 + 4m_^2(m_s)(m_s)^y_^216 ^ 2 [ eq27 ] + & = & 2t(m_s)4m_^2(m_s ) ( m_s)^y_^216 ^ 2m_(m_s ) ( ( m_s)^y_^216 ^ 2 - 1)^2 + 4m_^2(m_s)(m_s)^y_^216 ^ 2  , [ eq28]where , ( [ eq28 ] ) has been obtained from ( [ eq27 ] ) by using the fp condition , @xmath140 .",
    "then , because of smallness of the @xmath141-yukawa coupling in the sm with @xmath142 in ( [ eq28 ] ) there is negligible @xmath143-dependence and the predicted mixing remains stable , close to its maximal value , for all values of @xmath143 below @xmath134(tev ) .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for initial values of @xmath129 , @xmath144 ev , @xmath145 ev , @xmath146 ev , @xmath147 ev@xmath125 and other values of parameters same as in figs .",

    "the dashed line of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the continuation of the resonance structure at @xmath149 tev when the susy scale is @xmath8 and the evolution of mixing throughout is as in mssm given by ( [ eq14 ] ) or ( [ eq16 ] ) . the part of the solid line below @xmath150 tev exhibiting almost flat behavior of the predicted mixing angle , with @xmath151 , has been obtained using ( [ eq28 ] ) with @xmath152 and corresponds to the fp and the susy scale both at @xmath153 tev . in this case",
    "the formula ( [ eq25 ] ) applies to the part of the curve above @xmath153 tev .",
    "thus , we have shown for the first time that after radiative magnification through manifestation of fixed point at @xmath154(tev ) , the predicted mixing remains stable and close to its maximal value at all lower energy scales . in this regard our analysis favors the class of mssm with @xmath3(tev ) susy scale .",
    "as explained in @xcite while keeping the quasidegenerate eigen states @xmath155 and @xmath156 to have the same cp - parity for radiative magnification , it is necessary to have cp - parity of @xmath157 to be opposite to prevent radiative magnification in the @xmath158 sector from small values of @xmath159 which are consistent with chooz - paloverde @xcite bound . in this case",
    "solar neutrino anomaly @xcite is explained by @xmath160 oscillation through small angle msw effect .",
    "in this section , we briefly remark on the implications of our magnification scheme for neutrinoless double beta decay experiments .",
    "so far we have considered only two generation mixing . in complete models , one will have to embed this mechanism into scenarios with three generations or three generations plus a sterile neutrino . in the former case ,",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are degenerate , then we have all three neutrinos nearly degenerate in mass in order to fit solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "in particular , we could have all three neutrinos to have same cp .",
    "an example of such an extension is given in @xcite .",
    "we see below that in this particular embedding of our scenario , neutrinoless double beta decay can provide a test of the idea of radiative magnification of the atmospheric neutrino mixing .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay experiment measures m_ee = _ k u_ek^2 m_k  , [ eq29 ] where , @xmath161 denotes the mass eigenstate label . for our case with @xmath162 , @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the common mass of all the neutrinos .",
    "we will show now that for radiative magnification scheme to work , one must have a lower limit on the common mass of all neutrinos @xmath164 which depends on the value of @xmath165 of the mssm . from ( [ eq22 ] ) , we have the lower bound m_0 ^ 2 [ eq30 ] in fig .",
    "4 , for a fixed @xmath166 , we show the variation of the lower bound on @xmath164 with @xmath165 .",
    "we have choosen @xmath167 gev , @xmath168 tev and we see that for lower @xmath165 values , the lower bound on the common mass increases .",
    "infact , for small initial mixings , a lower common mass implies a larger @xmath165 . for large @xmath169 , with @xmath170 gev and @xmath171 tev , the lower bound on the common mass varies in the range , @xmath172 ev .",
    "thus , once supersymmetry is discovered and the value of @xmath165 is determined , combining this with the improved searches for neutrinoless double beta decay@xcite , one can test the idea of radiative magnification for the three generation model .",
    "in particular , note that the lower limit on @xmath164 predicted above is very near the present upper limits . this should provide strong motivation to improve the limits on the lifetime of neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "we presented the analytic formula for rg evolution of neutrino mixing which demonstrates explicitly the fp structure corresponding to maximal neutrino mixing at the weak scale leading to the condition of radiative magnification .",
    "we have derived stability criterion for radiative magnification and show that the radiatively magnified two - neutrino mixing , predicted by the rg fixed point structure , remains stable and close to its maximal value , for all energy scales below the @xmath3(tev ) susy scale in mssm .",
    "this result is specific to the mssm and can not be realized in nonsusy sm .",
    "when this mechanism is applied to the standard model , one gets only a resonance structure with maximal mixing at @xmath8 and smaller mixings at all higher scales which are energy dependent .",
    "our numerical computations with the help of the analytic formulae clearly show that radiative magnification of high scale neutrino mixing takes place for quasidegenerate neutrinos having the same cp - parity and it remains stable only for the mssm .",

    "<S> the renormalization group evolution equation for two neutrino mixing is known to exhibit nontrivial fixed point structure corresponding to maximal mixing at the weak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the fixed point provides a natural explanation of the observed maximal mixing of @xmath0 if the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are assumed to be quasi - degenerate at the seesaw scale without constraining on the mixing angles at that scale . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it allows them to be similar to the quark mixings as in generic grand unified theories . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss implementation of this program in the case of mssm and find that the predicted mixing remains stable and close to its maximal value , for all energies below the @xmath3(tev ) susy scale . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how a particular realization of this idea can be tested in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments .    </S>",
