    "the sun is a fundamental benchmark in astronomical abundance studies .",
    "meteorites can be used to reliably infer relative abundances for numerous heavy elements and we have detailed information about limb darkening , precise fundamental parameters , and a wide variety of diagnostic features .",
    "a decade ago the problem of solar abundances seemed settled .",
    "a series of papers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* gs98 hereafter ) had established a consistent set of surface abundances , and interiors models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were in good agreement with helioseismic data ranging from sound speed as a function of depth to surface helium and convection zone depth measurements .",
    "however , the atmospheres models used in this generation of study were one - dimensional and had important simplifying assumptions about the physics of the atmospheres . with the advent of a new generation of numerical simulations it became possible to relax these severe assumptions . for many heavier elements such as iron",
    "the revisions in abundance were small and within the errors .",
    "however , the lighter elements ( cno ) were a different story .",
    "these species have problematic photospheric abundance diagnostics under solar conditions and meteorites can not be used to infer their primordial relative abundgances .",
    "the 3d model atmospheres , along with other revisions such as enhanced non - lte effects and the identification of blending features in commonly used abundance indicators , led to much lower cno abundances ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ags05 hereafter ) .",
    "the revised abundances placed solar interiors models in stark disagreement with helioseismic data ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this solar abundance problem spurred a re - examination of the opacities @xcite , which improved opacity data as compared to the original source from the opacity project @xcite but did not resolve the problem .",
    "the next generation of helioseismic studies took a different approach , inverting the problem and using distinct characteristics to infer a higher seismic abundance more in line with the gs98 scale ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* dp06 hereafter ) .",
    "dp06 identified the depth of the surface convection zone and the surface helium abundance as sensitive abundance diagnostics .",
    "this data could be used to predict absolute light and heavy metal abundances when combined with relative meteoritic abundances for heavy metals and relative photospheric / coronal abundances for cnone .",
    "@xcite used the depression of the adiabatic gradient induced by metal ionization , mostly from oxygen , to infer the absolute metallicty of the solar convection zone and obtained a comparably high abundance .",
    "@xcite derived a similar result from modelling the metallicity dependance of the mean molecular weight in the deep solar core .",
    "there was a subsequent burst of revisions in the atmospheric abundances .",
    "the initial generation of models were criticised for problems in fitting the observed solar limb - darkening @xcite .",
    "substantial revisions of the original model atmospheres led to a signficant improvement in the fit to solar data and removed the mild tension between the abundances of heavier elements ( fe , si ) and seismic inferences ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter agss09 ) .",
    "however , the estimates for cno abundances remained quite low .",
    "interestingly , a different group of investigators with an independant 3d atmospheres code had comparable agreement with solar data but found higher photospheric abundances @xcite .",
    "the solar abundance problem therefore takes on a different cast ; the distinction is not between new 3d and old 1d atmospheres , but rather on differing choices of abundance indicators and different ways of analyzing them .",
    "a similar point was made by us in a prior paper @xcite , where a reanalysis of the ags05 work found an atmospheric abundance scale intermediate between seismology and the prior 3d values , comparable to the one obtained by @xcite .",
    "however , neon has always been an important , and underconstrained , ingredient in the puzzle .",
    "ne is a significant opacity source in stellar interiors , so the helioseismic problems induced by low oxygen could be compensated for if the solar ne was sufficiently high @xcite .",
    "there are also chemical evolution arguments in favor of such a model @xcite .",
    "ne is not preserved in meteorites in significant amounts and lacks photospheric diagnostics because of its atomic structure . as a result",
    ", indirect arguments from coronal abundance ratios must be used , and significant variations from the standard mixture have been argued for @xcite .",
    "however , the bulk of evidence in the sun appears to favor a lower ratio @xcite ; see agss09 for a detailed discussion .    in dp06",
    "we used only the scalar constraints ( @xmath9 and @xmath2 ) as diagnostic features to infer abundances .",
    "however , ne retains electrons to higher temperatures than o does , and as a result different ne+o mixtures with the same opacity at the base of the surface convection zone will have different opacity in deeper layers .",
    "this leads to a distinct signature in the sound speed profile . in this letter",
    "we update the mixture constraints based on the same method , but with improved stellar interiors model physics . by adding the sound speed profile as an additional constraint we can set interesting bounds on the solar @xmath10 ratio , and these are reinforced by considering the seismic metallicity bounds based on ionization and",
    "mean molecular weight .",
    "in section 2 we recall the method used in dp06 , to determine the appropriate composition in order to reproduce the two observable scalars @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the extension of this method including the additional constraint @xmath11 to determine the ratio @xmath10 . in section 3",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "in dp06 we presented our method to infer the solar heavy and light metal abundances required for theoretical models that reproduce the observed solar @xmath1 and @xmath9 .",
    "there are three essential steps involved in determining a seismic solar composition and its associated error .",
    "first , the observed solar properties and their errors must be obtained .",
    "second , errors in the input solar model physics introduce uncertainties in the theoretically predicted @xmath1 and @xmath9 .",
    "these uncertainties can be correlated ; for example , increasing the degree of gravitational settling both deepens the model @xmath9 and decreases the @xmath1 .",
    "both the difference between theory and observation and the associated error are now defined for a given solar composition .",
    "changes in the abundance of the heavier metals primarily affect the @xmath1 through their impact on the central opacity and initial helium , while changes in the cno abundances primarily affect @xmath9 . as a result",
    ", we can solve for the heavy ( relative abundances inferred from meteorites ) and light ( relative abundances inferred from photospheric and coronal data ) abundances consistent with the solar data as a function of the assumed @xmath10 .",
    "we derived the seismic solar abundances in term of @xmath12 and @xmath13 keeping the ratios @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath10 and @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 stands for all metals but cnone ) constant .",
    "@xmath18 is the abundance of element @xmath19 on the logarithmic scale with @xmath20 .",
    "we obtained @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the calibrated model using the relative cnone abundances from the ags05 compilation .",
    "similar results were obtained using relative light element abundances from gs98 .    for the present work we first updated our solar model inputs , using an equation of state table @xcite with revised online data ( http://adg.llnl.gov/research/opal/opal.html , hereafter eos2006 ) , low temperature opacity tables from @xcite and updated nuclear reaction rates @xcite .",
    "we then solve for the uncertainties in sound speed profile for models with fixed @xmath9 and @xmath2 .",
    "this defines a range of sound speed deviations which can not be distinguished from theoretical errors , and which therefore set a bound on our ability to infer the ne / o ratio .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the sound speed profile ( @xmath23 ) include the observational errors in @xmath24 , uncertainties in the predicted @xmath23 due to the uncertainties in @xmath9 and @xmath2 and finally the theoretical errors from uncertainties in the model input physics ( opacities , equation of state , nuclear reaction cross sections , rate of gravitational settling ) and assumed solar properties ( age , radius , and luminosity ) . in the top panel of figure 1",
    "we illustrate individual theoretical uncertainties with lines and the total effect by the gray shade . on the bottom panel the measured @xmath23 uncertainties are in light gray , the ones induced by observational uncertainties in @xmath9 and @xmath2 are in medium light gray and the theoretical error envelope is in medium dark gray .",
    "the total error envelope is represented in dark gray in the bottom panel .",
    "our detailed procedure is described below .    in order to estimate the effect of the different physics ingredients onto the @xmath23 profile , we changed one at a time and adjusted the composition in the same manner as in dp06 to recover the seismic @xmath9 and @xmath2 .",
    "the differences in @xmath23 between these calibrated models are then measures of the impact of theoretical uncertainties on the @xmath23 profile .",
    "we adopt the same error estimates and central values as described in table i of dp06 with the following exceptions .",
    "the errors and central values of the nuclear reaction cross sections have been taken from the sources cited above and for the equation of state the errors are derived from the differences in the prediction between the eos2001 and eos2006 tables .",
    "we used the differences in the calibrated model sound speed profiles to infer the envelope of uncertainties . from the top panel of figure 1",
    ", we see the uncertainties in the diffusion coefficients for gravitational settling ( dot - dashed line ) are the most significant error source , followed by the uncertainties in the opacities ( solid line ) .    the observational uncertainties in the solar @xmath23 are deduced from the range of inverted solar structures in @xcite ( see figure 1 , bottom panel , light gray envelope ) .",
    "errors in @xmath9 and @xmath2 also impact the @xmath23 profile .",
    "the fractional depth of the convection zone is @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical location of the convection zone depth can change by up to 0.001 with different opacity interpolation methods @xcite ; we therefore treat the latter as the uncertainty in @xmath0 . the helium abundance in the surface convection zone ( @xmath26 )",
    "is measured from the strength of the depression in the adiabatic gradient in the helium ionization zone ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see dp06 for discussion ) .",
    "the observational errors in @xmath0 and @xmath2 permit a range of derived compositions which will then generates different predicted @xmath23 profiles .",
    "the values @xmath27 and @xmath28 define a reference mixture .",
    "the maximum @xmath23 profile change occurs for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this is our one @xmath31 errors envelope ( the medium light gray shade in figure 1 , bottom panel ) .",
    "we added the three sources defined above in quadrature to obtain the total envelope for uncertainties in the sound speed profile difference ( dark grey shade of figure 1 bottom panel ) .",
    "the theoretical errors predominate .",
    "we are now in a position to extract additional information from the sound speed profile above and beyond those constraints imposed by the measurement of @xmath9 and @xmath2 .",
    "carbon and nitrogen are much less abundant than oxygen and have similar ionization structures . as a result , our method does not place interesting constraints on the @xmath14 and @xmath15 ratios .",
    "however changes in ne / o have a significant impact on the @xmath23 profile , as seen in the top panel of figure 2 where we compare different calibrated models to one reference model which has @xmath32 .",
    "in the bottom panel we present the percentage difference between the solar @xmath23 and the different calibrated models with a(o ) ranging from 8.90 ( top ) to 8.70 ( bottom ) in 0.05 dex increaments .",
    "the dashed line correspond to our prefered model which minimizes the rms in the percentage difference in @xmath23 .",
    "ne remains opaque to higher temperatures than oxygen , so a combination of higher ne and lower o which yields the same opacity at the base of the convection zone will be more opaque deeper in the star .",
    "this difference is at a maximum relative to the theoretical uncertainties at 0.56 solar radii .",
    "changes of @xmath33 of @xmath34 dex at this radius are comparable to the 1 @xmath31 total error .",
    "we treat 0.17 dex as our uncertainty on the @xmath10 ratio from the @xmath23 profile independent of the scalar or coronal abundance constraints .    in figure 3",
    "we present the predicted @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( top panel ) and the percentage difference in @xmath23 between the sun and severals models using various compositions .",
    "as previously noted , low o scales are strongly disfavored in both the scalar constraints ( top panel ) and the @xmath23 profile ( bottom panel ) .",
    "all of the models are discrepant at a statistically significant level in the @xmath23 immediately below the surface convection zone .",
    "we attribute this to the treatment of the mixing which is required to explain the low solar li @xcite . as in dp06 , we reduced the settling coefficient to account for the effect of rotational mixing from full evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "however rotational mixing requires a more complete model so we do nt use this feature as a diagnostic and defer such a topic to a subsequend paper .",
    "also illustrated in the bottom panel of figure 3 ( dashed line ) is a model with low o ( value from agss09 ) and high ne ( to satisfy the helioseismic contraints @xmath0 and @xmath2 ) which is excluded at more than two @xmath31 .",
    "helioseismology has proven to be a powerful means of inferring the solar composition .",
    "the depth of the surface convection zone and the initial helium abundance are very sensitive to the opacity of light and heavy metal respectively , and the errors in these model properties can be reliably quantified . reproducing these seismic scalar features",
    "require a relatively high solar metallicity .",
    "if we combine these scalar constraints with reasonable priors about the relative abundances of cnone ( from the photosphere ) and heavy elements ( from meteorites ) we can therefore infer a seismic solar mixture based primarily on stellar interiors physics .",
    "recent revisions to the input physics of the solar model - improvements in the nuclear reaction cross - sections , low temperature opacities , and equation of state - yield a reference a(o ) = 8.86 and a(fe ) = 7.50 which is the same as dp06 .",
    "however , the linkage between the thermal structure and the composition is indirect , which can lead to ambiguities in the interpretation of the strong constraints imposed by the measured solar thermal structure .",
    "fortunately , there is additional information encoded in the solar sound speed profile and there are independent helioseismic diagnostics which yield very similar results .",
    "it is common to use differences in sound speed between models and the sun as a measure of agreement .",
    "however , many of the striking visual features in such difference plots are in fact manifestations of errors in the independently determined scalar features , especially the convection zone depth .",
    "we therefore argue that extracting information from the sound speed profile first requires calibration to a common set of observables , which can be achieved with modest adjustments of the solar composition .",
    "sound speed variations at the 0.1 - 0.2 % level arise from reasonable changes in the input physics .",
    "this sets a threshold below which deviations between the sun and the models can be explained by known observational and theoretical sources .",
    "it is possible to construct different relative mixtures of the light species cnone which have similar opacities at the base of the convection zone , and thus similar scalar properties .",
    "changes in c and n are weakly constrained because their ionization structures are similar to that of oxygen and they are much less abundant ( by the same token , even large variations in c and n can not produce a low surface oxygen ) .",
    "neon , by contrast , is abundant enough that large variations could change the estimated oxygen , and uncertain enough that such variations can not be dismissed out of hand .",
    "we find that changes in the ne / o level produce a strong differential sound speed signature at @xmath35 which is explained by ne retaining electrons ( and thus higher opacity ) to higher temperatures than o does .",
    "although the resulting bounds are modest ( 0.08 dex in oxygen ) , there would be a clear signal from a very high ne / very low o mixture which are clearly not present in the data .",
    "our method is sensitive to opacity , and as a result the most likely systematic error source is in the theoretical quantum mechanical opacity calculations despite the very good agreement between independent theoretical calculation .",
    "experiments are underway to check on this possibility and transition to an abundance scale primarily based on experiments .",
    "however the same high abundances are inferred from two other independent helioseismic diagnostics - the level of metal ionization in the convection zone and the mean molecular weight of the solar core . in a comprehensive review , @xcite found that increases in neon did not reduce the need for a high oxygen in the convection zone ( c.f .",
    "their figure 21 ) .",
    "one would therefore need to invoke multiple errors in distinct interiors and atmospheric input physics , with the same sign and magnitude , to produce an acceptable high ne - low o mixture .",
    "our best interiors estimate for composition is @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xcite combined recent atmospheres measurements for estimates of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; these two scales are consistent within the errors .",
    "a weighted mean of the two leads to @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 which we contend is the most precise current estimate for abundances . in dp06 we derived relationships quantifying combinations of c , n , o , and ne with the same @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in the case of ne ,",
    "nonlinear effects can be induced when the change in the ne / o ratio is too large and a better fitting relationship is @xmath45    our abundance scale is consistent with some photospheric abundance measurements @xcite but not the lower agss09 values .",
    "this is not a conflict between modern and primitive atmospheres treatments , or between one- and three - dimensional studies , but rather reflects differences between competing atmospheres models and judgment calls on the choice of indicators , continuum levels , and the proper treatment of blending features .",
    "we are therefore hopeful that helioseismology may provide an absolute abundance standard which can be used to discriminate between competing models and which can be used to calibrate the appropriate composition diagnostics for the next generation of stellar models .",
