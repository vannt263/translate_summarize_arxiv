    "the o4f star @xmath1 puppis has for decades been at the cutting edge of research regarding early type stars because of its optical and uv brightness . in addition , because of the low interstellar attenuation ,  has been the prime x - ray target to study soft x - ray emission from o stars .",
    "researchers have looked to this source to settle outstanding controversies about the physical location , quantity , and nature of the hot x - ray emitting plasma on ob stars . in this paper",
    "we present the highest resolution x - ray spectrum of  ever measured and explore the physical mechanism of hot star x - ray production .",
    "prior to the discovery of x - ray emission from o stars ( harnden et al .",
    "1979 ; seward et al .",
    "1979 ) , cassinelli & olson ( 1979 ) postulated thin base coronal zones as a source for x - rays to explain the observed uv superionization ( lamers & morton 1976 ) by way of the auger effect .",
    "the coronal models ( cassinelli & olson 1979 ; waldron 1984 ) predicted an x - ray absorption at the oxygen k - shell edge larger than that observed with  sss ( cassinelli & swank 1983 ) and ( corcoran  1993 ) . these observations , as well as detailed modeling of the superionization profiles ( macfarlane  1993 ) and lack of detection of the iron `` green line '' ( baade & lucy 1987 ) in caused the coronal model to fall out of favor .",
    "increasingly , a consensus formed around a wind - shock picture in which a series of shocks , perhaps related to the line - force instability ( lucy 1982 ; owocki , castor , & rybicki 1988 ) , causes hot , x - ray emitting gas to be distributed _ throughout _ the dense stellar wind of  and other ob stars .",
    "wind shock models developed by lucy & white ( 1980 ) , feldmeier  ( 1997 ) and others , consistently failed to predict the high levels of x - ray emission observed in the brightest o stars like , leading to the suggestion that perturbations somehow form and propagate up from the photosphere into the wind and drive stronger shocks ( feldmeier 1995 ; feldmeier , puls , & pauldrach 1997 ) .",
    "broad - band x - ray observations of ( corcoran et al .",
    "1993 ; hillier et al .",
    "1993 ) indicate that some wind attenuation is affecting the soft x - ray flux .",
    "however with the advent of and we can apply , for the first time , diagnostic emission line ratios and measure line profiles to determine the locations and doppler velocities of x - ray sources in the stellar wind of .",
    "we obtained a 67 ks  high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) observation of  from 2000 mar 28 , 13@xmath2 31@xmath3 ut to mar 29 , 09@xmath2 12@xmath3 .",
    "the standard pipeline tools were used to reprocess the data with the most recent calibration files available .",
    "line emission is clearly evident in both the high - energy grating ( heg ) and the medium - energy grating ( meg ) .",
    "the combined @xmath4 order , background - subtracted , hetgs spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "triads of he - like ions known as the  ( forbidden , intercombination , and resonance ) lines ( , , , , and ) are seen , in addition to isolated  emission lines and numerous l - shell lines of iron , especially .",
    "traditionally , he - like ion @xmath5 line ratios have been used to derive electron densities of x - ray line emitting regions since the populations of the 2@xmath6p levels are controlled by collisional excitations from the 2@xmath6s levels ( gabriel & jordan 1969 ) . however , when a strong external uv source is present",
    ", the excitation 2@xmath6s @xmath7 2@xmath6p is predominantly radiative and this means that the @xmath5 ratio is no longer a density diagnostic , but rather it can be used to determine the strength of the uv radiation field ( blumenthal  1972 ) .",
    "the uv wavelengths associated with the radiative excitation are in the range from @xmath8 to 1650  , where o star uv fluxes are very strong . for s photospheric flux",
    "we use a kurucz ( 1993 ) model , assuming = 42000k . since the 2@xmath6s @xmath7 2@xmath6p wavelengths are not on the wien side of the spectrum , the model atmosphere fluxes are relatively well determined .",
    "waldron & cassinelli ( 2001 ) demonstrated how the observed @xmath5 line ratios can be used to derive the line formation radii from the geometric dilution of the photospheric radiation field in ( 09.5ia ) .",
    "kahn  ( 2001 ) used a similar approach to derive line formation radii from their  _ rgs _ spectrum of .",
    "our  hetg spectrum has better resolution at essentially all he - like ion wavelengths and greater sensitivity to the short - wavelength lines ( e.g. , si and s ) than the  spectrum . this high resolution is very important for o stars since their x - ray lines show strong broadening .",
    "the observed he - like @xmath5 line ratios are listed in table 1 .    * table 1 : @xmath0 ratio measurements *    llllll & & & & & + & @xmath9&@xmath10&@xmath11 & @xmath12 0.1 & @xmath12 0.1 +   _ r / i _ & @xmath13&@xmath14 & @xmath15&@xmath16&@xmath17 0.6 + @xmath18 & 0.81 & 3.06&3.26&5.77&3.56 +    @xmath19total flux of the three lines in @xmath20 erg @xmath21 s@xmath22    figure 2a shows the radii derived from our measurements of the he - like @xmath5 ratios .",
    "the radii of line formation are seen to vary from ion to ion , with lines from high nuclear charge ions ( si , s ) forming at small radii , and lower nuclear charge ion lines ( o , ne , mg ) forming at larger radii .",
    "one might expect the @xmath0 line complexes for each element to be formed over a range of radii and not just in a thin shell .",
    "however , since the line emission is proportional to @xmath23 , the observed emission in each line complex should be dominated by the densest regions (  the smallest radius ) from which the line radiation can escape . for  the @xmath0 formation locations",
    "correlates with the associated radial optical depth unity radius , @xmath24 .",
    "the optical depth is measured through the wind , using the continuum opacity at the wavelength of each triad of @xmath0 lines . any line radiation that originates much below @xmath24",
    "could not be seen by an external observer .",
    "the wavelength dependence of @xmath24 for is shown in figure 2b using a @xmath25-law with @xmath26 0.75 as the velocity law , the wind absorption cross sections in waldron ( 1998 ) , and the stellar parameters of lamers & leitherer ( 1993 ) ( @xmath27 = 16 , = @xmath28 , and = 2200 ) .",
    "an inspection of figure 2 leads to the following conclusions : first , the he - like line formation radii are all consistent with their associated @xmath24 values , as expected from the above argument .",
    "second , the @xmath5 ratio of  indicates that hot plasma exists below 1.2  where the nominal wind velocity is @xmath12 600 .",
    "most radiative instability simulations do not show strong shocks this close to the star ( feldmeier 1995 , owocki , castor , & rybicki 1988 ) .",
    "however , using a velocity jump even half as large as the local wind velocity ( @xmath29 ) to calculate the shock temperature from @xmath30 , we obtain a post - shock temperature of 1 mk ; too low to produce .",
    "thus , anomalously strong shock jumps are required deep in the wind .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by waldron & cassinelli ( 2001 ) , but for  the highest ion stage observed was  instead of the  seen here .",
    "the most notable feature observed in our hetg spectrum of  is the clear presence of blue - shifted x - ray line centroids in all strong lines .",
    "this is in contrast with previous  o star observations ( schulz  2000 ; waldron & cassinelli 2001 ) where the lines were broad , symmetric and un - shifted .",
    "although our line widths are comparable to other o - star observations , with hwhm of @xmath31 1000 , our observation is the first  detection of blue - shifted and blueward skewed x - ray line profiles in an o star .",
    "figure 3 displays six  x - ray lines arranged in order of wavelength .",
    "the results for the line fits are given in table 2 .",
    "there is an interesting progression that holds for these lines : the centroid shifts are generally larger for the broader lines , indicating a connection between radial location , wind absorption , and the doppler broadening of the line emission . in table 4 of their xmm study of , kahn  ( 2001 ) list blueshifts of the lyman-@xmath32 lines of  and .",
    "the blueshifts agree with ours to within 2 sigma , and some of the discrepancy can be attributed to the absolute wavelength calibration uncertainties of the instruments ( @xmath31 100 km s@xmath22 for the hetg ( chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) 2001 ) , see den herder  2001 for the rgs ) .",
    "the xmm results show the same trend between shift and broadening .",
    "the  line is an exception to the trend in table 2 because of its small centroid shift .",
    "it is different morphologically from the other lines ( also noted by kahn  ( 2001 ) ) .",
    "it has a roughly flat - topped profile so we use a box fit instead of a gaussian to estimate the values for table 2 .",
    "* table 2 : line profile widths and centroid shifts *    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     there is a blueward skewness observed in many of the  lines which is not attributable to the hetgs line response function ( cxc 2001 ) .",
    "the blue sides of these lines tend to be steeper , while the red sides have a shallower slope .",
    "in general , the shape of these lines indicates wind broadening combined with attenuation as would arise from line formation in the marginally thick region near @xmath24 .",
    "macfarlane  ( 1991 ) , ignace ( 2001 ) , and owocki & cohen ( 2001 ) demonstrate that emission line profiles can provide important information about the spatial distribution of hot plasma within a stellar wind based both on the velocity - dependence of the intrinsic emission and also on the continuum attenuation across the line .",
    "assuming isotropic emission , the red - shifted emission from the back side of the wind is suppressed by the continuum opacity along the line of sight , while the blue - shifted emission from the near side is less so .",
    "this leads to skewed , almost triangular - shaped lines in an optically thick wind .    in the  hetg spectrum ,",
    "waldron & cassinelli ( 2001 ) found that an optically thin model was needed to provide a reasonable fit because the lines were symmetric and un - shifted .",
    "this fit required that the assumed mass loss rate for  be greatly reduced .",
    "for  we have the odd situation that the blueward shift and asymmetric line profiles agree with what has long been expected for hot stars , but this is the first time that it has been so clearly observed in a  spectrum for any star .",
    "we find that a fit can be made to the line profiles without making a significant reduction in the assumed mass loss rate in contrast with the  results .",
    "the  line profile is different from those of the other ions as can be seen in figure 3 and table 2 .",
    "the doppler half - width of this line is much greater than any of the other x - ray lines .",
    "this velocity of 1570  can be compared with the terminal speed of 2200 determined from uv wind lines .",
    "a flat - topped line profile such as this is expected from a fast moving shell source suffering little or no wind attenuation ( macfarlane  1991 ) .",
    "therefore , in contrast with the other observed lines , the nvii profile is probably formed well above its continuum optical depth unity radius .",
    "the hetg emission line spectrum of , with its unprecedented resolution ( in excess of @xmath33 for some lines ) and sensitivity over a wide range of wavelengths , allows us to draw quantitative conclusions about the nature of the x - ray source on this prototypical hot star .",
    "most importantly , we find that the wind plays an important , observable role in determining the x - ray line profiles of , in contrast to results for other stars",
    ".    we can begin to constrain the physical processes which lead to the production of the hot , x - ray emitting plasma on this star .",
    "taking all the he - like ions from oxygen through sulfur into account , the correlation between the formation radius of the @xmath0 lines and the radius at optical depth unity , @xmath24 , we find evidence for a spatially distributed source of x - rays throughout the expanding wind .",
    "there are two lines of particular interest in the development of future shock models : , and .",
    "the shock jump required to produce  appears inconsistent with the expected local wind conditions , requiring a post - shock flow velocity of approximately zero .",
    "although this is not impossible for a shock model to reproduce , it places strong constraints on future modeling efforts .",
    "the  line line may have a shape distinct from the other lines in our spectrum because it is formed in the outer regions of the wind where there is no further acceleration of the x - ray source region and little overlying wind attenuation .",
    "this hetg data set provides the most detailed and complete picture to date of an extended distribution of hot plasma embedded within a strong , optically thick stellar wind .",
