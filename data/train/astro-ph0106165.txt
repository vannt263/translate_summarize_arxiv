    "observational evidence in the sense that the nuclear / circumnuclear starburst coexists with the central active nucleus has increased recently . in the study of a sample of seyfert 2 galaxies , storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and gonzalez delgado et al ( @xcite ) have found that about 30 to 50 % seyfert 2 galaxies have nuclear starbursts . since both of them might be related to gas inflow , which could be triggered by the axis - asymmetric perturbation ( such as bars , tidal interactions or mergers ) , there is extensive speculation on the connection between starburst and nuclear activity ( norman & scoville @xcite ; terlevich et al .",

    "gu et al . ( @xcite ) studied 51 seyfert 2 galaxies from data available in the literature , and found that seyfert 2 galaxies with no evidence of a hidden seyfert 1 nucleus have characteristics in common with starburst galaxies .",
    "there are several observable spectral signatures to find the nuclear starburst in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "for example , in the ultraviolet ( uv ) band , the stellar wind resonance lines , such as n v @xmath01240 , si iv @xmath01400 and c iv @xmath01550 ( heckman et al .",

    "recently , cid fernandes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have suggested a series of empirical criteria for the existence of starburst in seyfert 2 galaxies , such as weak caiik @xmath03933 , low excitation lines and large far - infrared luminosity , etc .    in this paper , we report the presence of spectral signatures of nuclear starburst in the infrared luminous seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 7679 , with the infrared luminosity , @xmath2 , of @xmath3(veilleux et al .",

    "ngc 7679 is one member of arp 216 , the other is ngc 7682 , their projected separation is 89.6kpc ( arp @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that the starburst activity in this galaxy might be related to the tidal interaction with ngc 7682 , as indicated by recent numerical simulations ( barnes & hernquist @xcite ; mihos & hernquist @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "we describe our observations , data reduction and results . in sect .",
    "3 we discuss our results and summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "spectra of ngc 7679 were obtained on sept .",
    "28 - 29 , 2000 , with the boller & chivens spectrograph attached to the 2.1 m telescope of observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro martir ( mexico ) .",
    "we used a thomson 2048 @xmath1 2048 ccd and a 600 lines / mm grating , which provides a dispersion of 83  / mm .",
    "the width of the long slit was set to 2 \" ( i.e. , 664 pc for ngc 7679 ) .",
    "hear - spectra had been taken before and after the object spectra for wavelength calibration , and bd + 28 4211 was selected from kpno standards for flux calibration .",
    "the total exposure time was 10,800 s ( 2,700s @xmath1 4 ) .",
    "all spectra were reduced using standard iraf procedures .    in fig . 1 , we show the central 2 `` @xmath1 2 '' region spectrum of ngc 7679 , and in table 1 , we list all emission and absorption lines that we identify in the spectrum along with their respective equivalent widths ( ews ) .",
    "stellar absorption wings clearly evolve the h@xmath6 and h@xmath7 emission lines .",
    "for these lines , fluxes and ews were obtained using the iraf-_specfit _ routine .",
    "the spectrum also shows the presence of high order balmer absorption lines(up to h12 ) , and several weak absorption lines , such as , caiik @xmath03933 , cn @xmath04200 , g - band @xmath04300 and mgib @xmath05173 .

    "specfit_.    @xmath9 corrected for absorption of 5.7  .",
    "@xmath10 means for emission lines .",
    "to estimate the stellar population in the nuclear region of ngc 7679 , we compare our observed spectrum with the evolutionary synthesis model , gissel96 ( bruzual & charlot @xcite ) . following cid fernandes",
    "et al.(@xcite ) , we use three components : an old and an intermediate populations , with ages @xmath11 1 gyr and @xmath12 yr , respectively , and an @xmath13 power - law component to account for either a scattered agn continuum or a young starburst component , since it is impossible to disentangle the power - law agn continuum from the contribution of a young starburst of an age @xmath14 10 myr ( storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "@xcite ; gonzalez delgado et al .",
    "@xcite and cid fernandes et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we normalized all spectra at 4800  , and we compare parameters of continuum fluxes at 4020 , 4510 and 5500  , as well as ews of the absorption lines for caiik @xmath03933,cn @xmath04200 and g - band @xmath04300 . the relative errors on these quantities are set to less than 5% .",
    "2 shows the observed spectrum and the three component population synthesis fit .",
    "the fractions of the power - law component , the intermediate and the old populations contributing to the total 4800   monochromatic light are 35.4% , 42.9% and 21.7% , respectively .    for comparison",
    ", we make use of the empirical formulae by cid fernandes et al.(@xcite ) to derive the fractions of old and young population , the results are for the young , intermediate and old population , the fractions are 33.5% , 48.3% and 18.2% , respectively , which are consistent with our fitting results .",
    "the presence of high order balmer absorption lines indicate clearly the existence of intermediate - age stars in the nuclear region of ngc 7679 .",
    "but the origin of the power - law component , accounting for about 35% of the total 4800   flux , may be the result of a young starburst or a scattered agn continuum .",
    "it is well known that the stellar wind resonance absorption lines ( n v @xmath01240 , si iv @xmath01400 and c iv @xmath01550 ) are unambiguous signatures of young starbursts in the uv band , as suggested by heckman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; heckman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; and gonzalez delgado et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , these features can only be observed clearly in the brightest uv galaxies(heckman et al . @xcite ; gonzalez delgado et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    is there any indication of young starburst in the uv spectrum of ngc 7679 ?",
    "we retrieved the uv spectrum for this object from the iue public archive ( fig .",
    "3 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the iue and hst ghrs spectra of ngc 5135 .",
    "ngc 5135 is one of seyfert 2 galaxies that presents clear nuclear starburst activity and high order balmer absorption lines ( gonzalez delgado et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    comparing iue with hst ghrs spectra of ngc 5135 , we checked that all typical absorption lines(as marked in fig .",
    "3 ) in high resolution and high s / n ghrs spectrum are also present in the iue data , though the s / n is roughly low . at the same time , it is clear that all these stellar wind absorption lines are also present in ngc 7679 , in particular , we could see the clear p - cygni profile of c iv @xmath01550 , which is even more significant than that in ngc 5135 .",
    "although the iue spectrum is marginal , we find the clear signature of a young starburst in the nuclear region of ngc 7679 .    that the power - law component is the contribution of young starburst found in this work for ngc  7679 is consistent with a recent work by cid fernandes et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "these authors have found that all @xmath15 sources are confirmed seyfert 2/starburst composites ( where @xmath16 means the contribution from a power - law featureless continuum ) and in these sources , the featureless continuum is dominated by nuclear / circumnuclear starburst , because in seyfert 2 galaxies the scattered light from the central agn can not exceed @xmath17 30 % , otherwise we should observe the reflected broad lines directly and the galaxy would be no longer classified as a seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "in this paper , we present the unambiguous evidence for the recent starburst activity in the nuclear region of ngc 7679 , which are : the higher order balmer absorption lines and weaker caiik @xmath03933 , cn @xmath04200 , g - band @xmath04300 and mgib @xmath05173 ; and in the uv band , several stellar wind absorption lines . using the simple three - component stellar population synthesis model",
    ", we obtain the nuclear stellar population could be 42.9% intermediate age(@xmath18 yr ) , 21.7% old ( @xmath111gyr ) combining with a 35.4% power - law component , which might be from the young massive nuclear starburst activity .",
