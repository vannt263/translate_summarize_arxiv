    "based on our calculations , in the case of @xmath3 , the only available solution for the interval of @xmath4 , is fundamental solution and no transition is observed along this solution at this interval . for the case of @xmath5 ,",

    "this study indicates that an electric and magnetic charge transformation occurs for the pole which is located at the centre during the _ type 1 _ or _ reverse type 1 _ transitions .",

    "the 3 + 1 dimensional su(2 ) ymh lagrangian is given by    @xmath37    where the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field is @xmath38 in which @xmath39 is the higgs field mass and @xmath6 is the higgs self - coupling constant .",

    "now the euler - lagrange equation leads us to the following set of equations of motion    @xmath46    upon symmetry breaking , the electromagnetic field tensor proposed by t hooft is @xcite @xmath47    where , @xmath48 .",
    "we can separate the above mentioned abelian electromagnetic field into two terms , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the maxwell part and @xmath51 is the dirac part of the t hooft electromagnetic field . for the topological magnetic current density",
    "@xcite we have @xmath52 so that , for the conserved topological magnetic charge carried by the higgs field , we can write @xmath53 furthermore , we know that @xcite the topological magnetic charge is the total magnetic charge of the system provided that the gauge field is not singular . in our case in this paper , the gauge field is nonsingular thus we can write the abelian electric field , @xmath54 , the abelian magnetic field , @xmath55 , and the net magnetic charge of the system respectively as below @xmath56 the @xmath36 used for solving axially symmetric dyon solutions is @xmath57 here the spatial unit vectors are given by @xmath58 and the isospin unit vectors are given by @xmath59 the @xmath0-winding number @xmath60 ( which is equal to the net magnetic charge for vanishing magnetic dipole cases ) is a natural number . here , we consider the values of @xmath61 and 5 . using the definitions of @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    ", the axially symmetric higgs unit vector will be @xmath64    using the eq .",

    "( [ eq.14 ] ) , drawing the lines of @xmath68 constant , on the vertical plane of @xmath69 , will represent the magnetic field lines .",
    "also it is easy to see that the unit vectors of magnetic field is given by : @xmath70    since the gauge field is time independent , the abelian electric field becomes @xmath71 now , like the magnetic field , we can construct the unit vectors of the electric field as well .",
    "@xmath72    at spatial infinity in the higgs vacuum , the time component of the gauge field is parallel to higgs field in isospin space @xcite , @xcite and the proportionality constant is the electric charge parameter , @xmath20 .",
    "then at large distances we can write : @xmath73 therefore , the electric field varies proportionally with the electric charge parameter , @xmath74 and then can be switched off by setting @xmath75 .",
    "the contour plot of the time component of the gauge potential , @xmath76 constant , gives the equipotential lines of the electric field which are always perpendicular to the electric field vectors .",
    "also the total electric charge of the system , @xmath77 can be evaluated numerically by @xmath78    from maxwell s electromagnetic theory , the dimensionless magnetic dipole moment for axially symmetric map / mac solutions , is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is given by @xcite : @xmath81 with @xmath82 for configurations with an even number of poles and @xmath83 for the case of an odd number of poles . in the mac system of solutions with odd number of poles , the symmetry of magnetic charge with respect to the @xmath84-@xmath85 plane ( the @xmath86 axis is the symmetry axis ) , causes the magnetic dipole moment to vanish .",
    "the angular momentum density is defined by @xcite :    @xmath87    using the same convention of eq .",
    "( [ eq.20 ] ) for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for axially symmetric map / mac systems we have @xcite , @xcite @xmath90 @xmath91 so that for the mac solutions with an odd number of poles , the angular momentum vanishes as well .",
    "the electrically charged bps case defines a lower bound for static energy which is given by @xcite @xmath92 hence , the dimensionless total energy of the mac dyon solution even in the limit of vanishing @xmath6 , is more than this lower bound and is given by @xcite , @xcite , @xmath93",
    "equations of motion ( [ eq.3 ] ) with the gauge field and higgs field of @xmath36 ( [ eq.9 ] ) , lead us to a system of eight coupled nonlinear second order equations for eight profile functions of the electromagnetic @xmath36 .",
    "the boundary conditions at large distances are given by @xcite , @xcite :    @xmath94    as we already mentioned ( and is formulated in the condition above ) , the higgs field and the time component of the gauge are supposed to be parallel in isospin space at large distances .",
    "the trivial boundary conditions at @xmath95 are given by @xcite , @xcite :    @xmath96    and along the @xmath86-axis we have @xcite , @xcite : @xmath97 where @xmath98 . here",
    "we choose the value of @xmath99 to be one .",
    "these sets of conditions together with gauge fixing condition @xmath100 , @xcite gives us the complete set of boundary conditions of mac dyon solutions with three poles .",
    "the numerical procedure for this problem consists of two major steps .",
    "the first step is implemented in maple and the second one is executed in matlab . in the first step , finite difference method is used to provide approximations for terms including derivatives in equations of motion .",
    "also maple is used to produce a jacobian sparsity pattern for the system of equations . in the second step ,",
    "the trust - region - reflective algorithm is used to solve the system of nonlinear partial differential equations by finding the roots of linear approximations of the nonlinear system ( linearization ) .",
    "the trust - region optimization methods are typically very sensitive to initial approximation @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this means that the quality of convergence which is supposed to become minimized and secondly , how small is first order optimality which is a measure to show how close is the point @xmath84 to optimal @xcite . ] and consequently the accuracy of our final result for total energy , total electric charge and geometrical configuration of the charge distribution , are quite sensitive to our initial guess for optimized function .",
    "a good choice for the initial guess to find a solution for @xmath101 , is the solution which is already obtained for @xmath102 . generally , a smaller value for @xmath103 , causes a better convergence .",
    "this means that in order to get a more accurate solution , we need to choose smaller steps and consequently higher number of optimization processes .    on the other hand , according to our previous experiences of numerical calculations in ref @xcite , the stopping criteria of the fsolve package in matlab are not adequately accurate in some cases and we need to run the optimization toolbox for a larger number of iterations in order to obtain smoother diagrams for the solutions .",
    "both of these limitations make it necessary to run the optimization toolbox for thousands of times to get a clear and accurate picture of final solution .    in our previous study of ref .",
    "@xcite , we used a version of numerical method in which all the numerical data processing steps were manually done .",
    "but to avoid the above mentioned inaccuracy , we need to generate a huge amount of numerical data for which the manual processing method will not be adequate .    for the current study , we generated a new version of the numerical method in which the numerical data processing steps are controlled automatically .",
    "also this new method confines the first order optimality of the solutions to a reasonable amount and controls the necessary number of iterations for a proper convergence .",
    "our polar grid of the size @xmath104 covers the region of @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "there are two major kinds of errors in our numerical solutions .",
    "one of those come from the finite difference approximation . in finite difference method , the error depends on the seleted type of approximation and the size of the steps of the grid .",
    "the error of our central difference approximation is of the order of @xmath107 .",
    "the origin of the error of the second kind is the trust - region - reflective optimization method and this error is quite dependent on the quality of the convergence .",
    "the vector of the functions which is supposed to be zero , after the convergence still has a small non zero value which is usually of the order of @xmath108 .",
    "it is clear that the effect of the first kind of the errors will be dominant and therefore the errors in our solutions are of the order of @xmath109 .. therefore higher orders of error are possible for those solutions . ]",
    "this study investigates the numerical solutions for the cases with the @xmath0-winding number @xmath110 , and 5 and the electric charge parameter , @xmath111 .",
    "the interval probed for the higgs coupling constant for @xmath112 and 4 is @xmath113 and for @xmath8 is @xmath114 .",
    "the fundamental solutions in all cases possess the smallest value of energy . in case of @xmath3 , no bifurcation ( new branching solution )",
    "is found . in case of @xmath5",
    "there are four critical points including two transition points , a bifurcation point and a joining point . for the case of @xmath7 ,",
    "three transitions and one bifurcation are detected and finally in the case of @xmath8 , there are two bifurcations , and two transitions .",
    "the energies of the branches of the second bifurcation of @xmath8 , are very close to the energy of the lower energy branch of the first bifurcation but geometrical studies beside their electric charge show that these solutions are different solutions with near energies .",
    "all of the solutions mentioned in this paper possess the positive net magnetic charge of @xmath60 .",
    "transitions in some cases cause the charge distribution to change but the total magnetic charge of the system is always equal to the @xmath0-winding number of the system .",

    "it is found that regardless of the value of @xmath0-winding number of the solutions , the electric charge of the fundamental solutions decreases rapidly within a very small interval of @xmath207 . at the same interval the total energy of the solution increases with increasing @xmath6 ( for @xmath208 ) .",
    "the energy of the bifurcating branches are always larger than the energy of the fundamental solutions .",
    "also this study shows that , the critical points of transition , bifurcation and joining points for larger values of electric charge parameter , @xmath20 , appear at smaller values of higgs self - coupling constant , @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig.16 ] indicates that , for very small values of @xmath6 , the diagram of energy versus @xmath6 has two different behaviours for the two cases of @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "total electric charge , q , is infinite for @xmath13 and @xmath210 .",
    "this fact causes the total energy to become infinite for @xmath13 and @xmath210 .",
    "for @xmath211 the total energy is not infinite at @xmath13 .",
    "however for those values of @xmath20 , the total energy increases very fast as @xmath6 decreases within the very small interval of @xmath212 .",
