    "methods from shape analysis were applied to a number of problems in computer animation : periodicity of animations , interpolation between animations and motion recognition .",

    "our main addition to this standard setting will be the incorporation of point correspondences between two curves one wants to match . in the particular application of animation processing , these correspondences will describe similar poses at different points in time in the two animations .",

    "our approach differs from the one presented in @xcite , where feature information is included in the form of auxiliary functions that are combined with the geometric curve to form higher dimensional curves that can then be matched by the usual methods .",
    "instead , we augment the matching energy functional with an extra feature matching term , leaving the elastic matching terms unchanged . in comparison to @xcite , which focused on matching three dimensional surfaces , we allow inexact matching of landmarks in our model . we will discuss in this article both the theoretical framework of shape matching with feature points and computational aspects .

    ", one only has to replace in   the last sum by @xmath196 note that this can be also used to implement hard constraints on the deviation of the feature points by setting @xmath197 for some hard bounds @xmath198 .",
    "in addition , the dynamic programming approach readily extends to the symmetrization discussed in section  [ sect : symmetric ] , again as long as the feature matching terms decompose . here , the last sum in   has to be replaced by @xmath199 we stress here that the function @xmath200 is linear on the interval @xmath201 $ ] , and thus its inverse , which appears in the formula above , can be trivially computed .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , shape matching techniques can be applied to certain computer animations such as , for instance , human walking motions .",
    "this has uses in the entertainment industry ( movie and tv production , and especially video games ) as well as potential biomedical applications .",
    "we will be working with skeletal animations , where motions are described in terms of bones and joints in an approximation of a human skeleton . a typical approach to generate such animation data",
    "is to use _ motion capturing _ methods , where a stuntman s motions are recorded by multiple cameras in a studio . by tracking a multitude of points on the stuntman s body as he moves ,",
    "the corresponding skeletal animation can be recovered .",
    "these animations face a number of limitations , however , and often require additional postprocessing .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details and examples .",
    "a _ skeleton _ is a directed acyclic graph where vertices and edges represent bones and joints , respectively .",
    "a joint represents a transformation relationship between two bones . in the case of human motions ,",
    "transformations between bones are restricted to rotations .",
    "joints can have one to three degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the knee has one degree of freedom while the foot has two , and the shoulder has three .",
    "[ fig : skeleton ] shows the skeleton used for our numerical experiment . by representing rotations using euler angles",
    ", we can collect all degrees of freedom of all joints in the skeleton as a high - dimensional torus , which we refer to as _ joint - space _ and denote by @xmath202 where @xmath59 denotes the total number of degrees of freedom in the skeleton .",
    "we can now unroll the joint - space torus in @xmath204 and represent animations as parametrized curves @xmath8 and @xmath9 in this space .",
    "the shape matching techniques developed previously can then be applied to these curves .",
    "see @xcite for more details .    in sect .",
    "[ sect : featureanimations ] , we will show how feature matching can be successfully used to complement such existing shape matching methods .",
    "we will begin , however , with a few examples of feature matching for planar curves to demonstrate the effects the additional feature term has on the curve matching .        as a first example",
    ", we consider the matching of two open curves , the first of which has three maxima and minima , while the second only has two ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : waves ] ) . using only the elastic matching term without any specification of feature points ,",
    "the resulting minimum energy path between the two curves approximately maps the first and the last extremum of the first curve to the first and the last extremum of the second curve , while the extremum in the middle vanishes slowly .",
    "adding feature points , one can change the behavior of the optimal path significantly .",
    "if , for instance , feature points are set on the last extremum of the first curve but in the vicinity of only the last extremum of the second curve , then the optimal path tries , during its evolution , to merge the last extrema of the first curve , while its lower portion is matched quite closely to the lower half of the second curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : waves ] , upper left ) .",
    "different behaviors follow from different choices of the feature points .    fig .",
    "[ fig : closedcurves ] shows similar behavior for closed curves . when using a purely elastic matching term , moving from the first hand - pose to second one seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : closedcurves ] , we end up with visually unappealing interpolations . by picking to corresponding fingertips on both hands as feature points",
    ", the algorithm achieves a much more natural looking transition from one shape to the other .",
    "however , feature points need to be selected carefully , as the last row in fig .  [",
    "fig : closedcurves ] shows . by attempting to match for example the thumb in one hand shape to the midway point between index and middle finger on the second hand shape ,",
    "we induce a physically implausible interpolation that involves growing a new thumb .",
    "we now turn to the use of feature point matching for animations .",
    "human animations come in an immensely large variety . walking motions alone can vary in speed , rhythm , step length , motions of the arms and so on .",
    "traditional elastic matching methods ( i.e. , without feature points ) can be applied to a large number of animations , but can sometimes struggle with animations that have large differences in rhythm , for example when matching a walking animation to a limping animation .",
    "feature points can be used to help with determining an optimal reparametrization to align two animations in time .",
    "[ fig : interpolatedanimations1 ] shows an example of using feature point information to aid in animation interpolation . the goal is to calculate interpolations between two different walking animations .",
    "these can be seen in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : interpolatedanimations1 ] .",
    "the animations differ in the number of steps , rhythm and arm motions .",
    "in addition , the character in the second animation starts walking forward only after a short delay compared to the first .",
    "the results of four different interpolation schemes ( linear interpolation of the euler angles , elastic matching with and without reparametrization and elastic and feature matching with reparametrization ) can be seen on the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : interpolatedanimations1 ] .",
    "the two superimposed lines show the trajectories of the left and right feet for each calculated interpolation .",
    "we can see how especially the varying numbers of steps in the two initial animation causes problems for the matching algorithms .    as feature points we picked the first three times when the left knee moves forward and past the right knee .",
    "this is already enough information for the shape matching algorithm to determine a `` good '' ( i.e. , visually convincing ) interpolation .",
    "similar results can be seen in the second example , which shows two walking animations stepping over an obstacle of different height as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : interpolatedanimations2 ] .",
    "again , the superimposed lines represent the trajectories of the feet , with noticeable bumps as the character steps over the obstacle . as before ,",
    "we have picked the first three times when the left knee moves forward and past the right knee as feature points . with this additional information ,",
    "the feature point matching algorithm manages to produce a visually convincing interpolation between the two animations , whereas the other matching algorithms fail and produce only garbled results .",
