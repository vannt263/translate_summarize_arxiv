    "<S> we report an experimental investigation of the two - dimensional @xmath0 = 1/2 antiferromagnetic mott insulator by varying the interlayer exchange coupling in [ ( sriro@xmath1)@xmath2 , ( srtio@xmath1)@xmath3 ( @xmath4 = 1 , 2 and 3 ) superlattices . </S>",
    "<S> although all samples exhibited an insulating ground state with long - range magnetic order , temperature - dependent resistivity measurements showed a stronger insulating behavior in the @xmath4 = 2 and @xmath4 = 3 samples than the @xmath4 = 1 sample which displayed a clear kink at the magnetic transition . </S>",
    "<S> this difference indicates that the blocking effect of the excessive srtio@xmath1 layer enhances the effective electron - electron correlation and strengthens the mott phase . </S>",
    "<S> the significant reduction of the neel temperature from 150 k for @xmath4 = 1 to 40 k for @xmath4 = 2 demonstrates that the long - range order stability in the former is boosted by a substantial interlayer exchange coupling . </S>",
    "<S> resonant x - ray magnetic scattering revealed that the interlayer exchange coupling has a switchable sign , depending on the srtio@xmath1 layer number @xmath4 , for maintaining canting - induced weak ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the nearly unaltered transition temperature between the @xmath4 = 2 and the @xmath4 = 3 demonstrated that we have realized a two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet at finite temperatures with diminishing interlayer exchange coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice formed of iro@xmath5 octahedra is an epitome of some of the most outstanding and challenging problems in condensed matter physics , such as electronic correlation with strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , quantum magnetism , metal - insulator transition , doped mott insulator , and latent superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key notion permeating these emergent phenomena is the 2d pseudospin - half mott insulating state stabilized through soc that entangles @xmath6 orbitals with spins and leads to a filled @xmath0 = 3/2 quartet and half - filled @xmath0 = 1/2 doublet @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of special interest is the square lattice of corner - sharing iro@xmath5 octahedra where the @xmath0 = 1/2 moments order in a 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet as found in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and ba@xmath7iro@xmath8 with a neel temperature of 240 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the usual isotropic heisenberg exchange , soc is believed to cause significant anisotropic exchange interactions , i.e. , pseudodipolar and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , in the effective spin hamiltonian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the former accounts for the basal - plane anisotropy in both compounds @xcite , whereas the latter induces large canting of the @xmath0 = 1/2 moments under the requisite octahedral rotations in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> understanding such a 2d antiferromagnet is of great importance for quantum magnetism and its connection with high - temperature superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it has been proposed that doping these materials could lead to superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have indeed found spectroscopic signatures similar to doped cuprates , including a @xmath9-wave electronic gap @xcite and persistent magnetic correlations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> previous investigations of square lattice @xmath0 = 1/2 materials were mostly on bulk sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and ba@xmath7iro@xmath8 , which are the @xmath10 = 1 end members of the ruddlesden - popper series , such as sr@xmath11ir@xmath12o@xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the unit cell of sr@xmath14ir@xmath15o@xmath16 can be considered as ( sriro@xmath1)@xmath17**@xmath18**sro , which is composed of @xmath19 layers of perovskite sriro@xmath20 ( sio ) sandwiched by rock - salt sro monolayers that are considered to be electronically and magnetically inert @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the @xmath10 = @xmath21 end member , sio displays exotic semi - metallic behavior due to the symmetry - protected dirac line nodes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was recently demonstrated that the layered lattice structure can be mimicked by replacing the sro layers with srtio@xmath1 ( sto ) layers , i.e. , inserting a monolayer of sto in every @xmath10 layers of sio during epitaxial growth @xcite ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ xrd](a ) ) . as a wide band gap dielectric @xcite , the inserted layers of sto block the vertical charge hopping between sio layers as its conduction band is @xmath22 2 ev above the sio @xmath0 = 1/2 band @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electric and magnetic ground states of the superlattices ( sls ) [ ( sriro@xmath1)@xmath23 , ( srtio@xmath1)@xmath2 ] ( @xmath10 = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and @xmath21 ) indeed exhibit an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator - to - paramagnetic metal crossover in analogy with the sr@xmath11ir@xmath15o@xmath16 counterparts . nevertheless , upon a closer examination , significant differences between the two series can be readily seen in their transition temperatures , magnetic structure , transport properties , optical conductivity , and their dimensional evolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these differences indicate that the details of the blocking layer may play a critical role in the physical properties of the confined 2d sio layers .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated the interplay of the intralayer and interlayer couplings by varying the blocking layer thickness in [ ( sriro@xmath1)@xmath23 , ( srtio@xmath1)@xmath25 ( @xmath10 = 1 and 2 for @xmath4 = 1 ; @xmath4 = 1 , 2 and 3 for @xmath10 = 1 ) sls prepared through layer - by - layer epitaxial growth . </S>",
    "<S> the sto layers in our sls are highly tractable during epitaxial deposition . </S>",
    "<S> this controllability of the blocking layer provides a unique benefit compared to studying the effects of the sro layers in the sr@xmath11ir@xmath12o@xmath16 series , where the sro layer is fixed by the equilibrium crystal growth . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we hereafter use @xmath10/@xmath4-sl to denote a sl with @xmath10(@xmath4 ) successive sio ( sto ) layers . for the 2/1- and 1/1-sls , we observed afm transitions and associated resistivity anomalies , consistent with the report in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , while no such resistivity anomaly was found in the 1/2- and 1/3-sls where the neighboring sio layers are further separated , both samples still show a clear magnetic transition in magnetometry at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the transition temperatures of the 1/2- and 1/3-sls were found to be almost the same , implying that the samples are approaching the 2d limit of the long - range magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> the transition temperature was also verified by resonant x - ray magnetic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the positions of the magnetic bragg peaks reveal that the interlayer exchange coupling , although no longer significantly contributing to the neel temperature , has a variable sign . this sign is entwined with the octahedral rotation relation of the adjacent sio layers and remains effective in aligning the canted moments . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is crucial in arranging the local canting into the macroscopic weak ferromagnetism .    </S>",
    "<S> sls with different stacking sequences were epitaxially grown by pulsed laser deposition on ( 001)-oriented sto substrates . </S>",
    "<S> a krf excimer laser beam ( @xmath26 = 248 nm ) with optimized fluency of 1.8 j/@xmath27 was used to ablate stoichiometric targets . in situ </S>",
    "<S> reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) patterns were monitored to control the film thickness in the range of 20 nm to 30 nm at the atomic level . during the deposition , </S>",
    "<S> the substrate temperature and o@xmath7 pressure were set at 700 @xmath28c and 0.1 mbar , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> we also found characteristic sl peaks originating from the alternating stacking of the sio and sto blocks along the @xmath35-axis , demonstrate that the sls have been prepared as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> all the samples were cooled from room temperature to 2 k with application of a 5 koe in - plane magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines are guides to the eye.,width=245 ]    resistivity and magnetization measurements as a function of temperature afforded rich information on the emergent behavior the blocking layer affects . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature - dependence of resistivity @xmath39 is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ppms](a ) , in which insulating behavior can be established for all sls . </S>",
    "<S> however , while resistivity anomalies at 105 k for 2/1-sl and 135 k for 1/1-sl were clearly observed , the @xmath40 plots of 1/2- and 1/3-sls are smooth without any discernible kink . </S>",
    "<S> this can be further exhibited by investigating the relation between @xmath41 and @xmath38 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ppms](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , no kink or peak was observed for the 1/2- or 1/3-sls , while @xmath26-like cusps can be easily seen for the 2/1- and 1/1-samples , characteristic of a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the observed kinks for @xmath4 = 1 are consistent with previous report @xcite and associated the canted afm transition . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ ppms](c ) shows the temperature dependent remnant magnetization ( re@xmath42 ) of the 2/1- and 1/1-sls which onsets at @xmath38 = 150 k and 120 k , respectively , and sharply increases close to the temperatures of their resistivity anomaly peaks . a recent optical conductivity study @xcite reported a larger bandwidth and a small charge gap in the 2/1- and 1/1-sls compared with the sr@xmath11ir@xmath12o@xmath16 counterparts </S>",
    "<S> this could allow the thermally activated carriers and their transport to be more easily subject to lower - energy magnetic excitations and reflected in the resistivity kinks upon long - range ordering . </S>",
    "<S> since the reduced gap was attributed to additional effective ir - ir hopping cross the thin sto blocking layer @xcite , one can expect that , when @xmath4 @xmath43 1 , the interlayer tunneling will be suppressed , reinforcing the effective electron - electron correlation . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is indeed consistent with the observation of enhanced insulating behavior in the 1/2- and 1/3-sls compared to the 1/1-sl .    driving the system to the 2d limit by suppressing the interlayer </S>",
    "<S> hopping also has a profound effect on the long - range magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> we found that diminishing the interlayer exchange coupling significantly suppresses the afm ordering temperature that , however , does not cease but is held with a finite value . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the temperature dependent re@xmath42 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ppms](c ) ) of the 1/2- as well as the 1/3-sls onsets at  40 k , indicating that the magnetic ordering survives at appreciable temperatures upon separating the sio layers . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , this significant reduction of the transition temperature compared to that of 1/1 sl points to the nontrivial role of the interlayer exchange coupling in support of the quasi-2d long - range ordering in the 1/1-sl . </S>",
    "<S> this is well in line with the hindered electronic hopping and exchange coupling along the @xmath35-axis due to the insertion of additional sto blocking layers . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the fact that the transition temperature of the 1/3-sl is almost identical to that of 1/2-sl suggests that the residual interlayer exchange coupling plays a secondary role in determining the transition temperature for @xmath4 = 2 , and that 2d long - range magnetic order is sustained by intralayer exchange coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> this behavior represents an exceptional macroscopic manifestation of magnetic anisotropy in stabilizing the spin - half 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet at finite temperatures within the iro@xmath7 plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been established that the dominant term in the magnetic hamiltonian in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 is an isotropic 2d heisenberg coupling between @xmath0 = 1/2 moments @xcite . however , according to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite , the long - range ordering of such an afm state is unstable against thermal fluctuation at arbitrarily small finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> one possible route for the ordering to survive at finite temperature is by introducing single - ion anisotropy to the moments through crystal field distortion for example @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another route is through exchange anisotropy @xcite , i.e. , pseudodipolar interaction , which has been proposed to be significant between neighboring @xmath0 = 1/2 moments by g. jackeli and g. khaliullin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not expect significant contribution from the first route here because the iro@xmath5 octahedron is elongated by @xmath44 in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 @xcite but rather uniform in perovskite sio @xcite ; thus , the weak single - ion anisotropy in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 , would only be weaker in sls .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) the stacking pattern of the magnetic structure and octahedral rotation pattern of a 1/1-sl @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) three possible magnetic structures of a 1/2-sl . </S>",
    "<S> tio@xmath5 octahedra within the sto block rotate out - of - phase in ( b ) and ( c ) , while in - phase in ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic structure in ( c ) with an afm interlayer exchange coupling was verified by x - ray resonant magnetic scattering to be the correct one ( fig .  [ scattering ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the open and solid arrows denote @xmath0 = 1/2 moments and canted moments in each iro@xmath7 plane , respectively.,width=321 ]    although the former picture can explain the 2d afm order within individual layers , one must also explain the observation of a non - zero net moment . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the net magnetizations in both sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and the 1/1-sl originate from canting of the afm moments within the plane @xcite , which is a consequence of the strong soc that locks the afm moments to the antiferrodistortive octahedral rotation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the canted moments must have a parallel interlayer alignment to avoid cancelling each other . in the @xmath10/1-sl </S>",
    "<S> , this parallel alignment was attributed to a combination of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ir - ir interlayer exchange coupling and the out - of - phase rotation of neighboring octahedra along the @xmath35-axis ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram](a ) ) @xcite , i.e. , a @xmath45 rotation in glazer notation @xcite . since the overall behavior of our 1/1- and 2/1-sls is almost identical to that in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we expect the same mechanism to be in play . </S>",
    "<S> it , however , breaks down when @xmath4 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> while the @xmath45 rotation ensures the adjacent sio layers ( intervened by sto layers ) are in - phase when @xmath4 = 1 and 3 ( fig .  [ diagram](a ) ) , the adjacent sio layers become out - of - phase when @xmath4 = 2 . assuming the fm ir - ir interlayer coupling persists in all sls , the canting would follow the rotation phase and the canted moments of different layers would cancel each other in the 1/2-sl ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram](b ) ) , which is opposite to the observed net moment . to reconcile this </S>",
    "<S> , one may instead speculate an afm ir - ir interlayer exchange coupling for @xmath4 = 2 , which combined with the out - of - phase rotation would render a parallel alignment of the canted moments ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> another possible scenario is that the tio@xmath5 octahedral rotation is in - phase along the @xmath46-axis within the sto block but out - of - phase with the iro@xmath5 octahedra at the interfaces , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram](a ) . in this case , the iro@xmath5 octahedral rotation of adjacent sio layers is always in - phase regardless of the sto layer number @xmath4 , and a fm ir - ir interlayer exchange coupling is valid .     </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) energy scan at the ( 0.5 0.5 6.5 ) magnetic reflection near the ir @xmath47 edge at 10 k. the measured fluorescence is also shown for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) temperature dependent intensity of the ( 0.5 0.5 8.5 ) peak . </S>",
    "<S> it well reproduces the square of re@xmath42 as indicated by the dashed curve . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) @xmath34-scans across the ( 0.5 0.5 6.5 ) , ( 0.5 0.5 7.0 ) , ( 0.5 0.5 8.0 ) , and ( 0.5 0.5 8.5 ) magnetic reflections , width=321 ]    to distinguish the latter two scenarios , a direct measurement of the interlayer exchange coupling is necessary since magnetometry is only sensitive to the net magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> based on this consideration , we performed x - ray magnetic scattering measurement at the ir @xmath47-edge on the 1/2-sl , in which the interlayer exchange coupling would be opposite between the two scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath34-scan performed at the ( 0.5 0.5 @xmath34 ) magnetic bragg reflection revealed that the nearest - neighboring @xmath0 = 1/2 moments within each iro@xmath7 plane are antiferromagnetically coupled , confirming the 2d afm ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the energy profile ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scattering](a ) ) of the peak intensity at 10 k also shows a typical lineshape with the maximum about 3 ev below the absorption peak represented by the fluorescence , which is similar to sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 @xcite and the 1/1-sl @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scattering](b ) presents the temperature dependence of a magnetic bragg peak , which increases at about 40 k , consistent with the magnetometry measurement and confirming the canting origin of the net moment . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , we only observed magnetic bragg peaks at @xmath34 = @xmath48 + 1/2 , where @xmath48 is an integer ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scattering](c ) ) , indicative of a doubling of the magnetic unit cell along the @xmath35-axis with respect to the sl unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> this unambiguously shows that the ir - ir interlayer alignment is afm , and confirms that the magnetic structure of the 1/2-sl should be as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagram](c ) ( indicated with a check mark ) . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the fm interlayer exchange coupling in 1/1-sl was characterized by magnetic bragg peaks only observed at @xmath34 = @xmath48 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior indicates that interlayer exchange coupling can change sign depending on the phase relation of the sio layers rotation patterns and is ineligible , although its magnitude no longer contributes to stabilizing the neel temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the extracted interlayer coherence length of   6 sl unit cells from the half width at half maximum ( @xmath220.026 r. l. u. ) of the ( 0.5 0.5 6.5 ) peak is almost half of that for 1/1-sl ( 11 sl unit cells ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an enhanced fluctuation could be the reason for the reduced magnetization of the 1/2-sl from that of the 1/1-sl and sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have tailored the spin - orbital physics in [ ( sriro@xmath1)@xmath15 , ( srtio@xmath1)@xmath49 sls through atomic control of the sio as well as the sto block thickness . by inserting one additional sto layer into the 1/1-sl , </S>",
    "<S> the effective electron - electron correlation is enhanced , while the interlayer exchange coupling is reduced , lowering the afm transition temperature of the 1/2-sl as compared to the 1/1-sl . upon further insertion of sto layers for the 1/3-sl , </S>",
    "<S> the ordering temperature remains at a similar value , suggesting that soc - driven anisotropic intralayer exchange coupling is the driving force for their long - range 2d magnetic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> combining these results with the x - ray magnetic scattering measurement , we found that the declining interlayer exchange coupling still plays a role in the net magnetization and its sign can be artificially modulated by varying the layer number in the sto block . </S>"
