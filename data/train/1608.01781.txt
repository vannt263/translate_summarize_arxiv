    "the phenomenon of entanglement has drawn considerable attention since its inception in einstein , podolsky and rosen s ( epr ) thought experiment @xcite .",
    "entanglement describes a system of particles that have one or more highly correlated quantum properties , such as position , momentum , spin , etc .",
    "specifically , two sub - systems that are entangled can not be described by independent wavefunctions .",
    "instead the quantum state of the combined system is described by a single wavefunction .",
    "for example , in the initial experiments on entanglement conducted with optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) @xcite , a linear intensity dependence was observed in the coincident absorption probability .",
    "this has been explained @xcite by considering the absorption of the signal photon together with the absorption of the idler counterpart , as they travel together .",
    "this explanation is based on the correlated nature of two photon state , though the usual quadratic dependence signature for a two - photon absorption process is absent in the observation .",
    "however , this is simple enough and deficient as it neither distinguishes between the classical correlation and entanglement , nor does it say anything about the higher order entanglement .",
    "later , first part of the deficiency was qualitatively addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", the time asymmetry , which is intrinsic to the two - photon state vector produced by successive decay of a three - level cascade system , is held responsible for the distinction between classical correlation and entanglement .",
    "still the order of entanglement obtainable from a cascade system remains unanswered . in this paper , we have attempted to address this problem by taking recourse to four wave mixing ( fwm ) process in a cascade system .",
    "the fwm process intrinsically acts as a generator of nonclassical states , especially as a generator of entangled photons @xcite and offers a unique scope for analyzing the existence of different orders of intermodal entanglement . in the quantum description of the fwm process",
    ", simultaneous annihilation of two pump photons ( which may have different frequencies ) creates a signal - idler photon pair .",
    "nonclassical properties associated with the fwm process have been studied almost since the inception of quantum optics .",
    "in fact , squeezed light was first experimentally generated using fwm @xcite . in the last few decades , nonclassical properties associated with fwm process",
    "have been studied in various ways ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "applications of fwm have also been reported in various contexts ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "specifically , applications of fwm have been reported for optical parametric oscillators ( opos ) @xcite , frequency - comb sources @xcite , single photon sources for quantum cryptography @xcite , stimulated generation of superluminal light pulses @xcite , optical filtering @xcite , low noise chip - based frequency converter @xcite , etc .",
    "further , in silicon nanophotonic waveguides , several useful optical phenomena related to telecom - band ( @xmath2 all - optical functions ( such as , wavelength conversion , signal regeneration and tunable optical delay ) have been demonstrated using fwm ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to these , fwm has recently been used to develop fwm microscopy @xcite , which is found to be very useful for the study of the nonlinear optical response of nanostructures @xcite ; enhancement of fwm ( i.e. , larger value of third order susceptibility @xmath3 in comparison to existing optical materials ) has been observed in plasmonic nanocluster @xcite .",
    "thus , we may comment that fwm is an extremely important process , which acts as a test bed for studying non - classicality of photons @xcite .",
    "this fact and the above mentioned applications have motivated us to investigate a particular aspect of fwm for a cascade system : intermodal entanglement . specifically , in this paper , we investigate the possibilities of generation of lower order and higher order entanglement in fwm process associated with a cascade system because entanglement has been established as one of the most important resource for quantum information processing and quantum communication @xcite . to be precise , with the advent of quantum information theory , several interesting phenomena ( e.g. , quantum teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite , etc . )",
    "are reported which do not have any classical analogue and which require entanglement as an essential resource .",
    "consequently , several systems have already been investigated as sources of entanglement ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , it is still interesting to find experimentally realizable simple systems that can produce entanglement . in what follows",
    ", we will show that fwm process associated with a cascade system can provide us one such experimentally realizable and relatively simple system .",
    "it would be apt to note that some efforts have already been made to investigate the existence of intermodal entanglement in fwm process , both theoretically and experimentally ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , higher order entanglement is not studied in any of the existing works .",
    "although , studies on higher order nonclassicalities @xcite have become relevant in the recent past .",
    "these works showed that there is indeed a dire necessity to introduce a higher order nonclassical criterion to detect weak nonclassicalities in a relatively easy manner . keeping these facts in mind , in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the possibilities of observing lower order and higher order intermodal entanglement in fwm process associated with a cascade system under the framework of sen - mandal perturbative approach @xcite that is known to provide analytic expressions for time evolution of field operators with greater accuracy compared to the traditionally used short - time solution @xcite .",
    "this is well established in earlier works ( @xcite and references therein ) . in what follows ,",
    "we report a perturbative solution ( using the sen - mandal approach ) for the heisenberg s equations of motion for various modes present in the hamiltonian of the fwm process .",
    "the perturbative solution obtained here is subsequently used to investigate the existence of lower order and higher order entanglement using a set of inequalities that can be expressed as moments of annihilation and creation operators . to be precise ,",
    "we have used here duan et al.s criterion @xcite and hillery zubairy s criteria @xcite to investigate the existence of intermodal entanglement .",
    "the investigation has revealed the signatures of the existence of lower order and higher order intermodal ( two - mode ) entanglement for all possible combinations of modes ( i.e. , entanglement is observed between ( i ) pump and idler modes , ( ii ) pump and signal modes , ( iii ) idler and signal modes ) .",
    "not only that the possibility trimodal entanglement is also investigated here , and it is found that the appropriate choice of parameters yields trimodal entanglement involving pump , signal and idler modes .",
    "remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : the - cascade - level - system ] , we describe the relevance of using the @xmath0 @xmath1 hyperfine manifold as a test bed for entanglement study by exercising fwm .",
    "the model hamiltonian for the fwm process described in section [ sec : the - cascade - level - system ] , is described in section [ sec : the - model - hamiltonian ] .",
    "this takes into consideration all the four modes as weak and thus quantum mechanical and subsequently we report an operator solution of the heisenberg s equations of motion corresponding to the each mode of fwm process .",
    "the solution is obtained using the sen - mandal perturbative approach . in section [ sec",
    ": intermodal - entanglement ] , possibilities of generation of lower order and higher order ( including tri - modal entanglement ) in fwm process are studied using the operator solutions obtained in section [ sec : the - model - hamiltonian ] . finally , the paper is concluded in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a practical level scheme , where cascade decay can be observed , is @xmath0 @xmath4 route ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - of - fwm ] a ) .",
    "the excitation of atoms to @xmath5 can be done in a two photon process either through an intermediate state , i.e. , ( i ) @xmath6 @xcite or through ( ii ) a virtual level by using photons of @xmath7 wavelength @xcite .",
    "however ( i ) is a more practised option to populate @xmath5 as for ( ii ) the absorption cross - section is much smaller .",
    "option ( i ) is used to describe several important optical processes , e.g. , fwm @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , double resonance optical pumping ( drop ) @xcite , optical switching @xcite , etc .",
    "[ fig : scheme - of - fwm ] a illustrates the level scheme under consideration where both ( i ) and ( ii ) pathways are clearly shown .",
    "the life times ( @xmath8 ) are in order : @xmath9 .",
    "hence @xmath10 acts as a leaky reservoir @xmath11 w.r.t .",
    ", @xmath12 with a leakage rate slow enough to satisfy @xmath13 so faster optical pumping and decay cycles centered on @xmath14 can be averaged over a single @xmath15 this does not violate the steady state condition ; further @xmath11 is decoupled from the main system .",
    "so it bears negligible influence on cascade excitations . on the other hand , @xmath16 ; hence spontaneous decay @xmath4 would replicate hyperfine structure of @xmath5 level ( cf .",
    "[ fig : scheme - of - fwm ] a ) . similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - of - fwm ] b illustrates a typical experimental spectrum obtained under pump - probe rabi frequency combination of @xmath17 both lasers are plane polarized and satisfy the @xmath18 connection .",

    "[ fig : scheme - of - fwm ] b ( ii ) is calibrated with the saturation absorption spectrum of the probe laser ( inset ; fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - of - fwm ] b ( i ) ) . here",
    "the probe laser is scanned and the pump is stationary .",
    "the spectrum shows prominent signatures of drop @xcite on the doppler broadened background of probe absorption .",
    "this situation is further clarified when the probe is locked to @xmath19 and pump is scanned and blue fluorescence of @xmath20 the decay channel is simultaneously monitored ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - of - fwm ] b ( iii ) , ( iv ) ) . in cases of fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - of - fwm ] b ( ii ) , ( iv ) the i , ii , iii represent drop signals of @xmath21 two photon transitions . unlike fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - of - fwm ] b ( ii ) , the spectrum in ( iv ) has no doppler background . here",
    "the locked probe laser in principle addresses small velocity groups of atoms resonant with the same .",
    "these atoms further reach @xmath22 by the pump laser itself . due to participation of highly selective velocity groups of atoms the resultant doppler background is largely reduced .",
    "though the counter propagating pump - probe combination is favorable for observing strong eit under two photon resonance ( @xmath23 ) condition ( i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) ; only trace of eit is observed to be present at the tip of drop profiles",
    ". this may be explained by considering the decay route @xmath26,which forms a pseudo - closed absorption - emission cycle . however , due to velocity selective nature ( considering @xmath27 is the generalized rabi frequency where , @xmath28 is laser detuning ) of optical pumping , it is apparent that there are also other decay routes , which remain active , resulting in a sufficient population of @xmath29 state facilitating drop condition @xcite and the eit is almost obscured . the striking feature of fig .",
    "1b ( iii ) , i.e. the blue fluorescence , is its one - to - one correspondence with the two photon absorption .",
    "this is because blue photons mainly originate from @xmath30 @xcite decay channel . in a simplistic manner",
    "we may think that under relatively higher pump power @xmath31and relatively lower probe power @xmath32,the blue light intensity ( @xmath33 ) bears a correlation of @xmath34 it shows that there exists finite possibility to produce spontaneous emission in a cascade decay , which at least remain intensity correlated to the probe .",
    "this intrinsic capability of cascade emission deserves further attention to explore if any kind of phase correlation is obtainable . to generate phase correlation , the co - propagating pump - probe configuration holds edge over the counter - propagating one .",
    "this is because fwm is realizable under the first kind of alignment where the phase matching condition demands : @xmath35 this indeed offers an unique scope where the phase and intensity correlation can be simultaneously obtained . by definition ,",
    "two beams of light can be made quantum mechanically entangled through correlations of their phase and intensity fluctuations .",
    "hence the cascade system under co - propagating laser action may act as a source of non - classical light .",
    "for a two photon cascade decay@xmath36 the situation may be understood as follows : ( i ) initially the atom occupies highest excited state @xmath22 while the field remains in vacuum @xmath37 ( ii ) the excited atom decays to intermediate state @xmath38 by emitting a photon and makes a final dash to @xmath39 with emission of another photon . to consider the total process",
    ", it is not possible to distinguish between the photon emission sequences like @xmath40 followed by @xmath41 or vice versa .",
    "in such situation , indistinguishablity of photon comes into play . for a cascade system ,",
    "the product state for ( i ) is @xmath42 while for ( ii ) they are @xmath43 and @xmath44 the total state vector becomes a linear superposition of these individual state vectors . at the very beginning",
    "the atom and the field remains entangled .",
    "but at later times the decoherence of the excited level population destroys the entanglement . as a result the final product state appears as : @xmath45 . in this case",

    "traditionally , fwm process is viewed as a third order nonlinear optical phenomenon having applications in various fields as summarized in sec . [ sec : introduction ] . recently , the domain of the generation and applicability of fwm have been considerably amplified .",
    "specifically , several new applications of fwm have been proposed . on the other hand ,",
    "applications of entangled states have been reported in various areas of quantum information .",
    "motivated by these facts , we have rigorously investigated the generation of lower order and higher order intermodal entanglement in fwm process using a set of moment - based criteria ( criteria based on moments of annihilation and creation operators ) and a physical system illustrated in fig.[fig : scheme - of - fwm ] , where fwm happens . to be precise ,",
    "present discussion is focused on a cascade system shown in fig.[fig : scheme - of - fwm ] , where fwm process occurs for @xmath0 @xmath1 hyperfine manifold . considering experimentally achievable parameters , it s observed that the parameters whose negative values indicate the existence of higher / lower order entanglement show an oscillatory nature with variation of rescaled time .",
    "further , it is observed that suitable choice of the phase of the initial coherent states plays a crucial role in the generation of entanglement . here , we observed bimodal entanglement between pump and signal modes and signal and idler modes , and have also observed trimodal entanglement using all these modes .",
    "thus , the output of fwm process studied here appears to be highly entangled .",
    "we conclude the paper with a hope that this highly entangled output of fwm process would find some applications in quantum communication and/or quantum information processing as fwm is a process that can be easily realized experimentally ( cf .",
