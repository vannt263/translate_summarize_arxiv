    "simulations of the ism in a shearing box domain have shown that turbulence driven by sne leads to an amplification of the mean magnetic field . using the test - field method ( schrinner et  al .",
    "@xcite ) , we derived transport coefficients relating the mean electromotive force to the mean magnetic field ( gressel  @xcite ) . with these we were able to reproduce the time behaviour seen in the simulations . under conditions found in our own galaxy , and assuming a constant circular velocity , a rotation rate @xmath0 was required for the dynamo to work .",
    "in order to further define the turbulence properties as a function of the star formation rate , rotation and gas density , we analysed a comprehensive set of direct simulations . taking these as an input , we here compute global mean - field maps for a set of different model galaxies .",
    "measuring test - field coefficients for a wide set of direct simulations ( gressel et  al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) led to the following scaling relations for the relevant diagonal term in the @xmath1  tensor , @xmath2 for the ( downward ) turbulent pumping described by the antisymmetric part of the @xmath1  tensor @xmath3 for the turbulent diffusivity @xmath4 and for the mean vertical outflow velocity @xmath5 the relations were derived for sf rates , @xmath6 , varying from one tenth up to the galactic value @xmath7 , angular velocities between @xmath8 and @xmath9 and midplane densities from @xmath10 up to @xmath11 . from the simulations , we moreover found a vertical gradient of the turbulent velocity @xmath12 independent of the star formation rate , density and angular velocity .",
    "we approximate the vertical profiles for the @xmath1  tensor by a @xmath13 curve with a scale height of @xmath14 .",
    "the value of @xmath15 is chosen to be constant for @xmath16 and linearly growing with a slope of one third outside this range . for simplicity , we assume a constant scale height within our models . we also neglect the anisotropic part of the turbulent diffusivity , which seems to be of minor importance for the current models .",
    "the rotation curve is modelled with a brandt law @xmath17 further we modify the vertical wind above @xmath18 by adding a radial outward velocity of the same size as @xmath19 .",
    "the wind velocities reach values of 100 - 200 km / s at z=4kpc , which is an order of magnitude higher than in the models of moss et al .  @xcite . with these input parameters ,",
    "we solve the induction equation @xmath20 in a cylindrical domain with @xmath21 , and of vertical extent @xmath22 . defining @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    ", we obtain a dynamo number @xmath25 .",
    "the pitch angle , @xmath26 , can be estimated by @xmath27 , scaling as @xmath28 .",
    "these estimates show that stronger sf reduces the dynamo number and increases the pitch angle .",
    "it is known that the stationary quadrupole solution of the @xmath29  dynamo exists only in a finite range of the dynamo number . because the final strength of the regular field also depends on the saturation process ,",
    "this estimate does , however , not provide a prediction for the final field strength in dependence of the star formation .",
    "nevertheless , this behaviour still opens the possibility for radially extended regular magnetic fields .",
    "this is because , in an exponential disc , sf decays much faster with radius than the angular velocity , and hence the dynamo number may be nearly constant over a large radial range .",
    "+        applying a kenicutt  schmidt - type law , @xmath30 , we can specify our galaxy model by a radial density profile , which we leave constant up to @xmath31 and then exponentially decay with a scale length of @xmath32 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] . for the nonlinear back - reaction",
    ", we use a classical , however anisotropic , @xmath1  quenching . while the usual quenching of only the diagonal terms in the @xmath1  tensor",
    "would lead to solutions with a small pitch angle , independently quenching the pumping term can also saturate the dynamo by the increasing field advection from the wind . in this case , the pitch angle of the kinematic mode can be preserved ( elstner et  al .",
    "the models rely on a crude approximation of the vertical profiles for the turbulent transport coefficients , which still leave some uncertainty in the absolute numbers given in table  1 .",
    "nevertheless , the general trend agrees well with the predictions form the local dynamo number analysis .",
    "the pitch angle , measured from the magnetic vectors ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : polmap ] ) of the polarisation map at @xmath31 , increases slightly with the star formation rate as predicted by the ratio @xmath33 above .",
    "the growth times of the order of @xmath34 tend to increase with the star formation rate , but there are exceptions ( cf . a1 and a2 of table  1 ) .",
    "no large - scale magnetic field amplification was observed for @xmath35 in model b3 , and in the weakly differentialy rotating model a5 . yet , strong starbursts are usually not long - lasting events and therefore the dynamo may still operate on longer time scales .",
    "the final field strength is not strongly dependent on the sf rate , and only the toroidal field is influenced by the difference in turbulent diffusivity .",
    "the inverse dependence of the dynamo action on the sf activity is mainly due to an enhanced turbulent diffusion .",
    "this does not necessarily increase the turbulent velocity but may equally change the correlation time .",
    "in fact , the preference of magnetic arms _ between _ the optical arms may be based on this very property of ism turbulence ( cf .",
    "rohde et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "* sf rate and rotation determine the dynamo  calling for adequate galaxy evolution models .",
    "* low star formation rates favour the dynamo , explaining coherent inter - arm fields .",
    "* strong sf may suppress large - scale dynamo action ( no vertical fields in the centre ) .",
    "* explaining the radio - fir relation will require a different type of amplification mechanism  at least for the small - scale field .",
