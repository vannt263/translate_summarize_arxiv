    "yet , the likely production site(s ) of the _ r_-process elements , as well as the mechanisms by which their abundances relative to the `` standard '' halo composition could vary so strongly from star to star in the early galaxy , remain essentially unknown",
    ".    explanations of this diversity fall into two main classes : inhomogeneous enrichment and incomplete mixing of the ism by the first generation(s ) of stars , or later , local pollution of neutron - capture elements by a binary companion of the presently observed star @xcite . in the first case ,",
    "the very uniform abundance pattern of the @xmath10- and iron - peak elements is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of models of stochastic star formation and enrichment in the early galaxy @xcite .",
    "this conflict would be resolved in the second case , but unlike the _ s_-process - element enhanced ba and ch giants , which are known to _ all _ be long - period binaries @xcite , this conjecture is so far without observational foundation .    here",
    "we report the first results from four years of precise radial - velocity monitoring , performed in order to assess the binary frequency of a sample of 17 _ r_-process - element enhanced vmp and emp giants .",
    "our results provide strong new constraints on the nature of the _",
    "r_-process production site(s ) and on the use of these stars as tracers of the star formation and/or merger history of the early galaxy .",

    "the radial - velocity zero point was checked with standard stars on every night of observation , and found to be reproducible to better than 45 m s@xmath21 per observation over a five - year period .",
    "thus , the accuracy of the radial velocities of the program stars is not limited by the instrument .",
    "our initial assumption , by analogy with the ba and ch giants @xcite , was that any spectroscopic binaries in the sample would likely have orbits of long period , low eccentricity , and small amplitude ",
    "i.e. , small , slow velocity variations .",
    "thus , our strategy was to observe these stars at roughly monthly intervals , weather permitting , and then adapt the frequency of the observations to follow any objects with radial - velocity variations detected in the initial data .",

    "our results enable us to address several issues of importance for understanding the likely astrophysical site(s ) of the @xmath1-process , and also shed some light on the early galactic production of carbon , as described below .      with three binaries detected in a sample of 17 stars ,",

    "the star he  2327 - 5642 , an r - ii star showing a possibly variable velocity @xcite , is below the southern limit of our sample , but is another candidate .",
    "this is fully consistent with the @xmath2220% binary frequency determined for normal cluster giants by @xcite .",
    "an additional 1 - 2 future discoveries in a larger sample might boost the frequency to perhaps as much as 25% , but there is clearly no evidence that _ all _ _ r_-process - element enhanced stars are binaries , as speculated by @xcite and others .    within the limitations imposed by the small sample",
    ", there also seems to be no difference in the binary population of the r - i and r - ii classes .",
    "similarly , of the two stars with measured u abundances , cs  31082 - 001 exhibits the so - called  actinide boost \" ( an over - abundance of th and u relative to third - peak _ r_-process elements such as eu ) and is a single star , while he  1523 - 0901 is a binary and shows no actinide boost .",
    "remarkably , the c - enhanced prototypical r - ii star cs  22892 - 052 also seems _ not _ to be a binary , despite the earlier suggestion by @xcite , indicating that its c content was not produced in a former agb companion .",
    "thus , membership in a binary system appears to be decoupled from details associated with these particular abundance variations .",
    "the periods and eccentricities of our three confirmed binaries are entirely consistent with those of the sample of chemically normal population i giant binaries by @xcite : the longest - period orbit is highly eccentric , and the shortest - period orbit is well below the limit of @xmath44d for tidal circularization . note that the old , metal - poor ch stars typically have circular orbits for periods up to @xmath45d . moreover , the secondary roche lobes are too small to accommodate typical agb stars of @xmath22 200 @xmath39 , if the secondary stars passed through this phase of their evolution .",
    "this is again consistent with the lack of _ s_-process - element enhancements in these stars .",
    "proving that the _ r_-process - element production did not occur in binaries provides no direct evidence of the nuclear physics process at the production site above that afforded by the detailed abundance analyses of these stars .",
    "models attempting to explain the observed _",
    "r_-process abundance patterns fall into two classes , core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) and merging binary neutron stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , also discussed comprehensively by @xcite , and in the context of cs  31082 - 001 by @xcite .",
    "the key feature to be highlighted here is that the newly - formed _",
    "r_-process elements were added in variable , but _ internally consistent _ proportions , in the otherwise constant chemical composition of the next generations of emp and vmp stars .",
    "that the _ r_-process - element abundances varied so strongly in the clouds from which these stars formed indicates that the _ r_-process elements were not simply uniformly dispersed , together with all lighter elements , in the supernova explosions that are a common feature of all astrophysical models for the _ r_-process .",
    "ejection in a jet or beam directly from the nascent neutron star(s ) seems the most natural scenario for achieving this .",
    "the chemical composition of the progenitor , and the varying distance and direction of the jet from the next cloud , would then explain , in a natural way , the continuously varying proportions of _ r_-process elements to the bulk composition of the following generation of emp stars .      in this scenario ,",
    "most stars would receive a  standard \" dose of _",
    "r_-process elements ; stars with _ r_-process - element abundances exceeding the average by a factor of @xmath46 would be seen as _",
    "r_-process rich , while those below the average ( exemplified by hd 122653 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would have been bypassed by the _",
    "r_-process ejection and appear as _ r_-process _",
    "poor_. this latter group may be as numerous as the former , but without spectacularly strong spectral lines to call attention to them .",
    "the recent discovery by @xcite of a cool , emp main - sequence dwarf with highly _ r_-process - enhanced elemental abundance ratios , consistent with classification as an r - ii star , would obviate any model to explain _",
    "r_-process enhancements as only due to some atmospheric anomaly confined to red giants .",
    "the existence of _ r_-process - element enhanced ( or depleted ) stars in a narrow range of metallicity near [ fe / h ] @xmath47 would imply that such anisotropic sn explosions only appeared at a certain `` chemical time '' , and that the ism was quickly fully mixed soon thereafter .",
    "the spectacular abundance anomalies of these stars can thus be used as extreme examples of  chemical tags \" of the sites and times of their formation .",
    "the r - i / r - ii classification is just a coarse tool to indicate the degree of enhancement .",
    "however , as r - i stars are also found at higher metallicity than the r - ii stars , they may have formed from clouds that were further enriched by material of `` normal '' halo composition .",
    "the different processes responsible for the light and heavy _ r_-process elements ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as the existence of stars with and without an actinide boost , remain to be explained by further modeling , but the binary properties of emp stars apparently played no role in this context : binaries formed with similar properties as in chemically normal stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , it is remarkable that the prototypical r - ii star cs  22892 - 052 is single _ and _ significantly enhanced in carbon , which has been assumed to originate in long - period binary stars together with the _",
    "s_-process elements , which are _ not _ observed in cs  22892 - 052 .",
    "this casts doubt on the accepted explanation for the synthesis of c in the early galaxy as due primarily to pollution by former agb binary companions , and suggests the synthesis of c , n , and o in earlier , rapidly rotating massive stars as one attractive alternative ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "eighty percent of our program r - i and r - ii stars exhibit no detectable radial - velocity variations , while three stars are binaries with well - determined orbits ( table [ tbl - orb ] ) , typical of systems with giant primaries , but no agb secondary stars .",
    "thus , the binary population among these stars is normal , and binary stars play no special role in producing the _ r_-process elements and injecting them into the early ism .",
    "the case of cs  22892 - 052 suggests that this may be true for the early synthesis of carbon as well .",
    "we conclude that whatever progenitors produced the",
    "_ r_-process elements ( and carbon ) were _ extrinsic _ to the emp and vmp stars we observe today .",
    "these elements were likely ejected in a collimated manner , and make these stars archetypical chemical indicators of their formation sites in the early galaxy .    this paper is based on observations made with the nordic optical telescope , operated on the island of la palma jointly by denmark , finland , iceland , norway , and sweden , in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",
