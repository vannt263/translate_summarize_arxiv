    "homotopy theory and , in particular , @xmath5-theory have recently played a prominent role in both condensed matter ( cm ) and high energy physics @xcite . in cm applications ,",
    "the discussion can often be reduced to the study of nonlinear @xmath2-models with symmetric space targets @xcite . in physical applications",
    "@xcite , there may be a potential function @xmath6 on the target symmetric space which can lead to distinct phases separated by an energy barrier .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to raise the possibility that even when there is _ no _ potential on the target symmetric space @xmath7 , and the physical space @xmath8 is as simple as possible  say a sphere or euclidean space  the energy landscape on ( smooth ) maps @xmath9 , maps @xmath10 from the physical space @xmath8 to @xmath7 , may have local minima , effectively creating sectors of false vacua .",
    "similarly , the space - time action of any field @xmath11\\rightarrow x$ ] interpolating between distinct vacua may be large compared to fields @xmath12 remaining within a single vacuum sector .",
    "such an @xmath13 is a novel kind of instanton protected by the intrinsic inefficiency of _ any _ homotopy between distinct vacua .",
    "this may be contrasted with conventional instantons , for example in yang - mills theory , where the instanton results from a _ willfully _ inefficient null homotopy : @xmath14\\rightarrow s^4\\cong hp^1\\subset hp^\\infty,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , is _ chosen _ to have nonzero degree .",
    "i will explain why no such minima are expected to arise when dim@xmath16 , dim@xmath17 .",
    "after this , as the dimension increases , little is known until we meet the example , @xmath18 , defined after equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the focus of this paper is the surprisingly complex geometry necessarily associated to _",
    "any _ null homotopy of : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath18 is a specific field on an @xmath3-dimensional spherical space taking values in the @xmath4-dimensional sphere .",
    "of course , there is the question of what energy functional to use for a general @xmath22 .",
    "something like @xmath23 where we have chosen units with @xmath24 and @xmath25 a constant with units of length , is a candidate ( note that for @xmath26 , rescaling @xmath10 toward a point @xmath27 by precomposing with a conformal transformation with @xmath28 a repelling fixed point makes @xmath29 approach zero ) . another possibility related to the choice @xmath30 is to let @xmath29 be the lipschitz constant of @xmath10 ( times a unit of energy ) .",
    "these choices entail serious analytical difficulties which are circumvented here by choosing a surrogate energy @xmath31 @xmath10 is presumed to be a smooth ( @xmath32 ) function and @xmath33 the @xmath34 betti number , @xmath35 ( i have now dropped coupling constants and reference to units ) .",
    "we use the echcohomology @xmath36 because it is appropriate for the nonregular point inverse images , which may be arbitrary closed subsets of @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , define the action @xmath37 of a field @xmath13 on space - time @xmath38\\rightarrow s^5 $ ] by @xmath39 both @xmath40 and @xmath37 are nonlocal  that is not integrated up from a locally defined quantity  but nevertheless seem to capture an essential feature of more physical hamiltonians and lagrangians , respectively : maps of high energy ( action ) are generally those with complicated point preimages ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "with this definition , @xmath18 has @xmath41 and can be deformed to the consant map @xmath42 , that is the true vacuum , with @xmath43 , but during the deformation we find that @xmath44 for some @xmath45 .",
    "thus @xmath46 is an energy barrier between a false vacuum @xmath18 and the true vacuum .",
    "similarly , the action must be large for any @xmath13 interpolating between @xmath18 and @xmath42 : @xmath47 whereas for paths staying within a vacua , for example @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the action can be much smaller .",
    "i should emphasize that although topology is used to define @xmath40 and @xmath37 , these quantities are _ not _ homotopy invariants : as @xmath18 is deformed , there will be times when @xmath50 jumps ; similarly for @xmath51 if @xmath13 were also deformed .",
    "what @xmath40 and @xmath37 _ do _ depend on is the topological complexity of the inverse images of points @xmath52 , and these can jump whenever @xmath28 is ( transiently ) a singular value .",
    "so one may understand ( figure 1 ) how preimage complexity roughly encodes energy .",
    "the surprise is that it may be necessary to increase the energy en route to decreasing it",
    ". it would be as if in passing from figure 1(a ) to figure 1(c ) we had to go through figure 1(b ) .",

    "the path components of immersions @xmath61 are known to be indexed by the winding number in @xmath62 .",
    "it is easy ( figure 2 ) to find two immersions @xmath63 and @xmath64 with equal winding where the `` complexity '' as measured by the number of multiple points , must increase during any regular homotopy @xmath65 , @xmath66 $ ] , beyond the initial or final values .",

    "it is hoped that some insight can be gained even from the `` toy functionals '' @xmath40 and @xmath37 .",
    "the key to the high dimensional example is the noninjectivity of whitehead s @xmath71-homomorphism from homotopy theory .    in summary , this paper is a message from topology to physics that fields _ might _ become trapped in local minima for the energy of a nonlinear @xmath2-model , even when the space - time and the target space are as homogeneous as possible : both spheres . in our example , the dimensions are a bit high ( except for string theorists ) and the action is a toy .",
    "the challenge for the reader is to determine if this same phenomenon can occur , or contrarywise is excluded , in more conventional , and perhaps lower dimensional , physical situations .",

    "increasing @xmath102 means going to a higher stable stem , and increasing @xmath103 merely means suspending maps within that stable stem .",

    "the essential point is that because the target @xmath239 is _ positively curved _ , the local energy density @xmath240 is not bounded by the usual eells - sampson maximal principle but instead may exhibit a specific singularity called `` bubbling '' under harmonic map flow . intuitively , according to topping , one should be able to run harmonic map flow until just before a singularity and then pause to do a @xmath241-twist to prevent the flow from being caught on the singularity and then resume the flow .",
    "the phenomenon of bubbling and the flow catching on a singularity are certainly intrinsic since the hopf map @xmath242 can be regarded as an `` essential loop of degree zero maps @xmath243 '' ; only the flow catching the singularity prevents the loop from being contracted .",
    "proceeding by dimension , the techniques of @xcite and @xcite might be useful in bounding the height of energy barriers within @xmath244 if they in fact exist , but so far nothing is known .    for @xmath245 ( and , more generally , @xmath246 where @xmath247 ) , the phenomenon of knotting implies the existence of @xmath40 energy barriers .",

    "one surprising geometric output of mathematical logic is the existence of enormous energy barriers related to recognition problems .",
    "it was shown in the 1950 s by boone and novikov that the triviality problem for finitely presented groups is undecideable .",
    "however the tietze theorem tells us that any two finite group presentations of the same group are joined by a finite string of four simple moves on presentations .",
    "the only way these two statements can be compatible is : + * fact 5*. _ the minimal number of tietze moves required to reduce a presentation of the trivial group of total size @xmath102 to the empty presentation must be a function @xmath248 which grows more rapidly than any recursive function . _",
