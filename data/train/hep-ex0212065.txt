    "experimental information on nucleon resonances , n@xmath7 and @xmath8 , has mainly come from studies of the @xmath9n and n(@xmath10,@xmath9 ) reactions .",
    "however , considerably large number of nucleon resonances predicted by quark models have not been observed in the pionic reactions .",
    "quark model studies suggest that a part of these missing resonances may couple to strangeness channels , such as k@xmath2 and k@xmath11 channels  @xcite .",
    "the p(@xmath10,k@xmath1)@xmath2 and p(@xmath10,k@xmath1)@xmath3 reactions give good means to search for such nucleon resonances .",
    "in fact , indications of new resonance contributions were seen around e@xmath12 = 1.5 gev ( w = 1.9 gev in totall energy ) in the cross section data of the p(@xmath10,k@xmath1)@xmath2 reaction measured by the saphir  @xcite and clas  @xcite collaborations . to reproduce the experimental data , missing resonances like d@xmath13(1900 ) ,",
    "were included in several theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , there still remains a controversy in the theoretical description of the cross sections  @xcite , because there are ambiguities of meson - hadron couplings and form factors at hadronic vertices together with the ambiguity of nucleon resonance amplitudes .",
    "therefore , additional observables are necessary to examine the theoretical models .",
    "the photon beam asymmetry is one of good candidates for the studies because the observable is quite sensitive to model differences .",
    "the contribution of the t - channel meson exchange is expected to become large at forward angles above the resonance region ( e@xmath14 2 gev ) .",
    "mesons exchanged in the kaon photoproduction are k , k@xmath7 , k@xmath15 , etc .",
    "the dominance of the unnatural parity exchange ( k and k@xmath15 ) leads to the photon beam asymmetry equal to @xmath16 while the natural parity exchange ( k@xmath7 ) leads to the photon beam asymmetry equal to @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may provide information on the t - channel meson exchange by measuring the photon beam asymmetries .",
    "since the leps spectrometer covers forward angles , the experimental data in the kinematical regions which can not be accessed at other facilities can be studied with good accuracy and statistics .",
    "at the spring-8/leps facility , linearly polarized photons are produced by the backward - compton - scattering process of laser photons on the 8-gev circulating electrons in the storage ring  @xcite . in the present measurement ,",
    "the maximum energy of the produced photons was 2.4 gev since an ar laser ( 351 nm ) was used .",
    "the photon energy ranged from 1.5 gev to 2.4 gev was measured by the tagging counter with the energy resolution of 15 mev ( rms ) .",
    "the polarization of the laser photons was typically 98@xmath18 , and the polarization of the produced photons was about 92@xmath18 at the maximum photon energy .",
    "a half of data was taken by the vertically polarized photons and another half was taken by the horizontally polarized photons to measure the photon beam asymmetries .",
    "the target was liquid hydrogen with a thickness of 5 cm .",
    "the leps magnetic spectrometer has been used to identify charged particles by the momentum and time - of - flight measurement .",
    "figure @xmath19 shows the mass spectrum measured by the leps spectrometer with the liquid hydrogen target .",
    "protons , kaons and pions are identified .",
    "a missing mass was calculated after selecting the k@xmath1 events .",
    "figure @xmath20 shows the missing mass spectrum of the p(@xmath10,k@xmath1)x reaction .",
    "one can see clearly separated @xmath2(1116 ) and @xmath3(1193 ) samples , and hyperon resonances , @xmath11(1385)/@xmath2(1405 ) and @xmath2(1520 ) .",
    "about 75,000 k@xmath1 @xmath2 and 50,000 k@xmath1 @xmath3 events were detected in the photon energy range 1.5 gev @xmath5 e@xmath12 @xmath5 2.4 gev and the angular range , 0@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath5 60@xmath4 .    ,",

    ", height=321 ]",
    "by making the vertically and horizontally polarized photons , two sets of data were accumulated to measure the photon beam asymmetries .",
    "the relation between the production yields in the two data sets and the photon beam asymmetry ( @xmath11 ) is given as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22(@xmath23 ) is the k@xmath1 photoproduction yield with the vertically ( horizontally ) polarized photons , @xmath24 is the k@xmath1 azimuthal angle ( angle between the reaction plane and the horizontal plane ) and @xmath25 is the polarization of the photons .     of the p(@xmath0,k@xmath1)@xmath3 reaction.,height=287 ]     of the p(@xmath0,k@xmath1)@xmath3 reaction.,height=287 ]",
    "the @xmath24 dependence of the ratio @xmath26 was fitted by the function @xmath27 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath28 was estimated by the fitting , and the degree of polarization @xmath25 was obtained by using the photon energy e@xmath12 . figures @xmath29 and @xmath30 show preliminary results of the photon beam asymmetries as a function of cos@xmath6 for the p(@xmath0,k@xmath1)@xmath2 and p(@xmath0,k@xmath1)@xmath3 reactions .",
    "only statistical errors are included in the error bars in the data plots .",
    "the signs of the beam asymmetries of both reactions are positive in the measured kinematical region .",
    "the values of our preliminary asymmetry data for the p(@xmath0,k@xmath1)@xmath2 reaction increase as the increase of the photon energy .",
    "the photon asymmetry slightly drops at larger angles above e@xmath12 = 1.7 gev .",
    "the photon asymmetry of the p(@xmath0,k@xmath1)@xmath3 reaction also increases as the photon energy increases .",
    "the angular distributions are flat over all the photon energy range .",
    "in the previous experiments , the cross section data of the p(@xmath10,k@xmath1)@xmath2 reaction have been discussed in connection with missing resonances , but the experimental data are not conclusive to confirm the resonances .",
    "we measured the photon beam asymmetries for the p(@xmath0,k@xmath1)@xmath2 and p(@xmath0,k@xmath1)@xmath3 reactions in the photon energy range 1.5 gev @xmath5 e@xmath12 @xmath5 2.4 gev and the angular range 0@xmath4",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath5 60@xmath4 .",
    "theoretical models can be examined and improved by including our photon beam asymmetry data .",
    "current data will extend our knowledge of the k@xmath1 photoproduction mechanism including the effect of nucleon resonances .",
