    "it is not completely clear if in fact this object was the outburst of an lbv . the faint , prolonged and erratic light curve and the low velocities @xcite are consistent with an lbv eruption , but @xcite discuss features of sn 1961v , such as the non - thermal radio spectrum , which are more in keeping with a fading sn remnant .",

    "stars from these two populations are evenly distributed together over the 12.5 square arcsecond region around sn 2002kg / v37 .",
    "the age of the young stellar population is consistent with the lifetimes of massive stars with @xmath15 , with the lowest age permitted by the uncertainties including the 2.5myr lifetime of @xmath16 stars .",
    "the uncertainty in the age of the younger stellar population arises from the proximity of the low age isochrones to each other .",
    "the age of the older population implies a maximum mass of @xmath17 for the component stars .",

    ". a worthwhile study would be to use the acquired spectra , or expanded broad band photometry , of the nearby clusters to estimate an age , in a similar manner to that of @xcite , to see if these are similar to the age of the young population of `` field '' stars .",
    "if one considers sn 2002kg / v37 to be either an sn or an lbv then the age requirements for both of these phenomena require the precursor to be a member of the younger stellar population .",

    "the evidence for strong @xmath5 emission in pre - discovery imaging is indicative that the precursor of sn 2002kg / v37 was not a standard blue supergiant .",
    "the change in absolute brightness from the pre - discovery to the post - discovery state is small , of the same order as variability previously observed for ngc2403-v37 .",

    "the change in brightness observed for sn 2002kg / v37 between the pre- and post - discovery states is small compared to that of lbvs where , following the scheme of @xcite , such a magnitude difference constitutes a `` large excursion '' rather than an `` eruption . ''",
    "+ sn 2002 kg follows the general trend of s dor variables which are blue during quiescence and proceed to the red upon outburst , as the increase in radius causes a drop in temperature as the outburst occurs at a constant luminosity .",
    "a key test would be to check if the pre - discovery state lies on the s dor strip and the post - discovery state lies on the constant temperature strip for outbursting lbvs on the hr diagram , between which lbvs move as they change from their quiescent state to outburst @xcite . a number of well studied lbvs are observed to lie in either one of these strips or vary between them @xcite .",
    "the placement of lbvs on the hr diagram requires an accurate effective temperature , which can only be determined with a model atmosphere analysis .",
    "+ the photometric observations , reported on fig .",
    "[ fig : snlbv:2002kglc ] , show that sn 2002kg / v37 has maintained its brightness over a period of at least 700 days .",

    "the light curve of sn 2002 kg is also at odds with the shallow linear decay observed for low velocity , interacting sne such as 1988z @xcite and 1995 g @xcite , which for interacting sne is due to the conversion of kinetic energy to radiation as a consequence of the interaction of the ejecta with the csm .",
    "the prolonged period of brightness is , however , similar to the observed light curve of the peculiar sn 1961v , which plateaued for @xmath21 months @xcite .",

    "sn 1997bs showed , however , a significant drop in the brightness over a similar time frame .",
    "+ the spectroscopic observations of sn 2002kg / v37 showed minor evolution over the interval of 0.97yrs .",

    "the reduction in the velocity widths of the balmer lines is much smaller than for the type iin sn 1995 g @xcite , inconsistent with a coasting phase .",
    "the spectrum of sn 2002kg / v37 is very similar to that of ngc2363-v1 and the spectrum of sn 1997bs @xcite , such as the relative line strengths and line widths .",

    "the strong feii lines in the spectrum are consistent with those observed in lbvs such as ngc2363-v1 and are sometimes assumed to be a classification criterion for identifying lbv outbursts .",
    "there are , however , a large number of feii lines are also observed in the spectra of sn 1995 g @xcite and no feii lines are seen in the `` fake sn '' sn 2000ch @xcite .",
    "sn 2002kg / v37 does show , however , strong lines , either side of @xmath5 , which are not observed in the type iin sn 1995 g @xcite .",
    "these strong lines are indicative of raised nitrogen abundance in an `` lbv nebula , '' formed from ejection of n rich material surrounding the lbv @xcite .",
    "the presence of these lines is important due to the conspicuous absence of other nebular lines , such as those listed in table [ tab : snlbv : hiitab ] , implying a raised n abundance .",
    "the strengths of the lines , relative to @xmath5 , reported here are smaller than those observed in the lbv nebulae studied by @xcite .",
    "this is because sn 2002kg / v37 is not - spatially resolved from the nebula and so , the observations reported here , contain flux from the star in addition to the nebula .",
