    "for more than 50 years ( e.g. , sandage 1953 ) , main sequence photometry has been the most direct method for determining the ages of both star clusters and populations with more complex star formation histories .",

    "recent evidence suggests that andromeda ( m31 ) may have more young globular clusters than the galaxy , implying that m31 may have obtained more of its clusters from cannibalized dwarf galaxies ( barmby & huchra 2000 ; burstein et al .",

    "our cluster photometry reaches the main sequence in the f606w ( broad @xmath14 ) and f814w ( @xmath15 ) bands , allowing a direct estimate of its age .",
    "our analysis is based upon comparisons to photometry of galactic globular clusters in the same acs bands , and upon a finely - spaced grid of isochrones calibrated using those clusters .",
    "these acs observations are part of a large program to image the m31 halo , with 3.5 days of exposure time split between the f606w and f814w filters ; see brown et al .",

    "the resulting color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) extends more than 1.5 mag below the old main sequence turnoff in the m31 halo .",
    "we included the globular cluster skhb-312 in our field so that the turnoff could also be reached in an m31 cluster ( figure 1@xmath16 ) .",
    "using images from the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , holland et al.(1997 ) determined the skhb-312 tidal radius to be @xmath17 .",
    "although small compared to the acs field ( @xmath18 ) , we placed the cluster near the field edge to minimize the field area contaminated by the cluster in case it appeared more extended in deeper observations . as expected for its high metallicity ,",
    "skhb-312 has no known rr lyrae stars , but it does have 13 long period variables near the rgb tip ( brown et al .  2004 ) ; two are within the area we ultimately analyzed .",
    "we measured a more tractable @xmath19 subsection around skhb-312 . after constructing a variable point spread function ( psf ) from the most isolated stars in the cluster vicinity , we performed aperture and psf - fitting photometry using the daophot - ii package ( stetson 1987 ) , with zeropoints matching the full field catalog ( brown et al .",
    "our photometry is in the stmag system : @xmath20  log@xmath21  mag .",
    "we constructed our skhb-312 cmd from stars within an an annulus chosen to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio and minimize field contamination . the inner radius ( 100 pix ; 3@xmath22 ) was where the completeness dropped precipitously for stars near the turnoff ( figure 1@xmath23 ) ; the outer radius ( 300 pix ; @xmath24 ) was where the density dropped to twice that in the field ( figure 1@xmath25 ) .",
    "because skhb-312 was near the field edge and the observations were dithered , the exposure time was not uniform across the annulus .",
    "we discarded the fraction of the annulus ( @xmath26% ) that had half of the total exposure time , but kept the fraction ( 14% ) that was exposed for 75% ; 86% of the annulus was exposed fully .",
    "we used extensive artificial star tests to determine the photometric scatter and completeness as a function of color , luminosity , and field position .",
    "small numbers of stars were repeatedly added to the images with a distribution tracking the cluster light profile ( to match these tests to the data ) , with the noise reflecting the exposure time variations .",
    "only those results within the 100300 pix annulus were used in our modeling .",
    "we then retained those 1720 stars in the skhb-312 catalog above the 80% completeness magnitude , with the cutoff being a function of position ( see figure 1@xmath23 ) , thus producing a much cleaner cmd .",
    "for consistency , we treated the cluster and field contamination models the same way (  3 ) .",
    "our program included acs observations of five galactic clusters spanning a wide [ fe / h ] range , to provide cluster fiducials and to verify the transformation of our isochrones to the acs bands .",
    "the most relevant here are 47  tuc and ngc5927 , bracketing the skhb-312 metallicity .",
    "our adopted parameters are listed in table 1 ; these values give consistency across the galactic cluster observations and imply one simple transformation of all isochrones to the acs bands .",
    "note that our isochrones do not include core he diffusion , which would reduce their ages by 1012% ( vandenberg et al .",
    "2002 ) . after reevaluating the range of parameters in the literature ,",
    "the galactic cluster parameters have been updated slightly from those assumed in our earlier papers ( brown 2003 ; brown et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the changes have been included in our calibration of the isochrone transformation .",
    "the parameters for ngc5927 are highly uncertain , due to its high , spatially variable reddening ( heitsch & richtler 1999 ) , but the values here are very close to those in harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "we observed the galactic clusters with staggered exposure times to increase the dynamic range , but the upper rgb saturated in the shortest possible exposure of 0.5  s.",
    "we show the cmd of skhb-312 in figure 1@xmath27 .",
    "this is the first cmd to resolve the main sequence in a globular cluster of m31 .",
    "the horizontal branch ( hb ) consists of a tight red clump ( unobscured in figure 1@xmath28 ) , with no extension to a blue hb , while the rgb is very red ; these features are distinct from the cmd of the general field population ( brown et al .",
    "2003 ) , and indicate that the cluster is more metal rich than many of the field stars . in this panel , we also plot the ridge lines ( _ curves _ ) and hb loci ( _ points _ ) of 47 tuc ( _ green _ ) and ngc 5927 ( _ red _ ) , shifted by the differences in distance and reddening between the clusters and m31 ( see table 1 ) . instead of applying a constant shift to the entire galactic cluster fiducial ( i.e. , its ridge line and hb locus ) , we applied a correction that more accurately accounts for the acs response curve . at each point along the fiducial we selected a synthetic spectrum ( castelli & kurucz 2003 ) , using corresponding points on a theoretical isochrone to determine the appropriate t@xmath29 and log  @xmath30 .",
    "we then reddened this spectrum with a fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) extinction law , first scaled to the cluster value and then to the m31 value . after folding both through the acs bands ,",
    "the difference provided the reddening vector at that point in the fiducial .",
    "accounting for differences in metallicity , the agreement at the hb indicates consistency in the assumed distance moduli , and the relative rgb positions are as expected .",
    "however , the subgiant branch of each galactic cluster is significantly fainter than that of skhb-312 .",
    "inspection of the cmd and the luminosity function ( lf ) of each cluster shows that @xmath31 from the hb to the subgiant branch is @xmath32  mag smaller in skhb-312 than in either of the galactic clusters ; this is an indication that skhb-312 is 23  gyr younger than those clusters , independent of distance , reddening , and ( to a considerable extent ) metallicity assumptions .",
    "we used 3 approaches to estimate the age of skhb-312 : fitting by eye of the cmd to calibrated isochrones ( as often done in the literature ) , comparison of the cmd to population models using a maximum likelihood statistic , and comparison of the lf to population models using several different statistics .",
    "our models are based upon the isochrones of vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which agree well with cmds of galactic clusters spanning a wide range of metallicity .",
    "these isochrones have been slightly updated from those used in brown et al .",
    "we also used a new grid of synthetic spectra ( castelli & kurucz 2003 ) to calculate the transformation directly from physical parameters ( t@xmath33 , log  @xmath30 ) in the isochrones to magnitudes in the acs bands ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) ; the updated spectra include changes to the convective overshooting , new opacities , and the availability of alpha - enhanced compositions .",
    "as in our earlier work , this transformation includes a small empirical color correction ( @xmath36  mag ) to force agreement between the transformed isochrones and the acs cmds of the galactic clusters .",
    "this correction is smaller and simpler than that used previously ( likely due to the improvements in the isochrones and spectral libraries ) , but the net result is very similar , given the goal is agreement with the same acs cluster observations .",
    "after this correction , the isochrones match the ridge lines within @xmath37  mag until the saturation point in the galactic clusters . when comparing isochrones to cluster data , we have used isochrones with [ @xmath38/fe]=0.3 , and transformed them using spectra with the same enhancement .",
    "note that globular clusters tend to show alpha enhancement at all metallicities ( thomas , maraston , & bender 2003 ) , compared to the field population .",
    "we show the fitting by eye in figure  1@xmath28 , where we compare the skhb-312 cmd to isochrones of 8 , 10 , and 12  gyr .",
    "the rgb is very insensitive to age , but sensitive to metallicity .",
    "our transformed isochrones at [ fe / h]=@xmath39 agree well with the rgb of skhb-312 , implying the same metallicity determined by holland et al .",
    "there is good reason to use the holland et al .",
    "( 1997 ) metallicity : our transformation to the acs bands can not be verified on the upper rgb , where the lever on metallicity is greatest , due to the saturation of such stars in the acs observations of galactic clusters , while the holland et al .",
    "( 1997 ) work was based upon wfpc2 data , which had a very reliable transformation between ground and space bands ( holtzman et al .",
    "clearly the main sequence turnoff and    0.09 in    0.1 in = 6.5 in    subgiant branch in figure  1@xmath28 are too bright at 8  gyr , and too faint at 12  gyr , implying an age of @xmath110@xmath40  gyr for skhb-312 .",
    "however , fitting by eye ignores two subtle effects that might bias the fit toward younger ages : contamination by field stars , which are known to span a wide age range ( brown et al .",
    "2003 ) , and blends of stars in the crowded photometry , which can brighten the main sequence turnoff and subgiant branch .",
    "these effects are included in our quantitative modeling below .",
    "we compared cmd models to the data using a maximum likelihood statistic : @xmath41  ln  @xmath42 , where @xmath42 is the probability of a star falling at its observed cmd location , given the model under consideration .",
    "each model gives the expected distribution of stars in the cmd , on a 0.02  mag grid , so that the probability of a star being observed in a given bin ( @xmath42 ) is the fraction of the model falling in that bin ( see , e.g. , dolphin 2002 ) .",
    "the probability that all of the stars were observed in their given cmd bins is the product of the individual probabilities , and the maximum likelihood statistic is a logarithmic score reflecting the probability of observing the skhb-312 cmd under a given model .",
    "we focused on the cmd region highlighted in figure  1@xmath43 : @xmath44  mag and @xmath45  mag , as in brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which includes 1456 of the 1720 stars in the skhb-312 catalog .    to construct each synthetic cmd , we first populated our isochrones with a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , and then applied the photometric errors , blends , and incompleteness calculated in the artificial star tests , using the starfish code ( harris & zaritsky 2001 ) .",
    "we then modeled the halo field contamination by applying the photometric errors , blends , and incompleteness of the skhb-312 annulus to the best - fit combination of isochrones in brown et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which reproduces the halo data very well .",
    "note that one can not simply statistically subtract the field data from the cluster data , because they have dramatically different noise and completeness .",
    "after normalizing the field model to the area of the skhb-312 annulus , we found that the halo field contamination in the skhb-312 cmd was 8% by number .",
    "we combined the cluster model and field contamination model to create a synthetic cmd for comparison to the data , with the total number of stars normalized to 1456 .",
    "this was repeated for isochrone ages of 515  gyr with 0.5  gyr steps , with the likelihood statistic calculated for each , giving a best - fit of 11  gyr . to evaluate the goodness of fit , we created monte carlo realizations of the best - fit model and evaluated the likelihood statistic .",
    "the likelihood values for these samples were higher than for the model tested against the real data , suggesting that the models are imperfect ( e.g. , because of binaries , blue stragglers , a non - salpeter imf , or remaining imperfections in the isochrones ) .",
    "we reproduced the likelihood values seen for the best fit by distributing 60 stars ( 4% of the sample ) randomly within the cmd region being fit .",
    "we used the distribution of the monte carlo scores ( including 60 randomly distributed stars ) to assign confidence intervals to the ages measured from the real data .",
    "the results imply age constraints of @xmath46  age  @xmath47  gyr at 68.3% confidence and @xmath48  age  @xmath49  gyr at 99.7% confidence .",
    "thus , the likelihood fitting of the cmd is consistent with our `` by eye '' age estimate of 10  gyr .",
    "figure  1@xmath43 shows the cmd of skhb-312 outside of the fitting region , and a realization of the 10  gyr model within the fitting region .",
    "comparison of the model to the data ( figure  1@xmath28 ) shows good agreement .",
    "finally we fit the skhb-312 lf , which is often preferred when fitting data with few stars and/or large photometric errors .",
    "we collapsed the model cmds and the data cmd in color , and then compared them using three statistics : @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( mighell 1999 ) , and the likelihood statistic of dolphin ( 2002 ) .",
    "the best fit in each case , respectively , is 10  gyr ( 912.5  gyr at 68.3% confidence ) , 10.5  gyr ( 913.0  gyr at 68.3% confidence ) , and 10  gyr ( 8.512.5  gyr at 68.3% confidence ) ; the confidence intervals come from monte carlo tests , comparing the best model against realizations of that model ( artificial data ) , as done in the maximum likelihood fitting above .",
    "these results are also consistent with the likelihood fitting to the cmd and our fitting by eye , implying an age of @xmath110  gyr for skhb-312 .",
    "we have directly determined the age of the m31 cluster skhb-312 , by fitting its deep photometry extending below the main sequence turnoff .",
    "these data presented a difficult challenge because the cluster is so compact , and despite our extensive efforts , we do not find tight formal constraints on its age : 10@xmath52  gyr ( or @xmath53  gyr if core he diffusion were included in the models ) .",
    "however , skhb-312 appears to be 23  gyr younger than galactic clusters at similar metallicities .",
    "although these data prove that direct ages can be determined for m31 clusters with existing instrumentation , a program seeking tighter constraints would benefit from the use of the acs high resolution camera and the choice of a less compact cluster .",
