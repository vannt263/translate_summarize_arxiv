    "clusters of galaxies shows rich evidence for huge energy input within their vast inter - galactic space .",
    "mega - parsec scale radio halos observed in many rich clusters provide direct evidence of gev electrons accelerated within them ( e.g. feretti , giovannini 1996 ) .",
    "significant temperature variations in the cluster hot gas , detected by asca ( e.g. furusho et al .",
    "2001 ) as well as chandra and xmm - newton ( e.g. markevitch et al .  2003 ; briel et al .",
    "2004 ) , can be interpreted as relics of energy dissipation associated with cluster mergers .",
    "another striking feature is so called  cavity \" in the cluster centers ( e.g. birzan et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is suggestive of an energy input at a level as high as @xmath6 erg .",
    "these new violent features of clusters of galaxies challenge the classical view of a single phase hot plasma hydorstatically filling the gravitational potential formed by a dark matter halo .",
    "the intra - cluster volume , for example , may harbor plasma components much hotter than the virial temperature and/or a significant amount of non - thermal particle population .",
    "the same stroy may apply also to groups of galaxies , the subject of the present paper .",
    "they hosts a fair amount of hot gas , called inter - galactic medium ( igm ) with a temperature of about 1 kev ( see e.g. mulchaey et al .",
    "x - ray emission from the igm is dominated by fe - l shell lines which appear in the soft x - ray range around 0.6 - 1.4 kev . since the emissivity of igm is very low in energies above 2 kev , we can search this  hard \" energy region of the x - ray spectra of groups of galaxies for any additional harder emission component , such as thermal signals from hotter plasmas mixed in the igm or non - thermal emission from accelerated particles .",
    "the asca mission ( tanaka et al .  1994 ) , operated from 1993 to 2000 , was equipped with four x - ray mirror optics covering the energy range up to @xmath7 kev .",
    "although their angular resolution was limited , the total effective area of asca at 6 kev is larger than that of chandra . furthermore , the gis experiment ( makishima et al .  1996 ; ohashi et al .",
    "1996 ) onboard asca is characterized by its very low and stable background , together with a wide field of view ( @xmath8 in diameter ) and a high quantum efficiency toward @xmath7 kev . thanks to these properties , the gis background level normalized to the effective area and sky area , shown in figure [ fig : intro : gismerit ] , has been the lowest among the x - ray detectors with imaging spectroscopic capabilities up to 10 kev",
    "therefore , data from the gis is least affected by background uncertainties ( both statistical and systematic ) , which strongly limit the sensitivity to largely ( @xmath9 ) extended emission in the hard x - ray band above @xmath10 kev .",
    "the power of the gis detector is demonstrated , for example , by the detection of non - thermal inverse compton emission from the radio lobe of fonax - a ( kaneda et al .",
    "1995 ) . as a result ,",
    "the asca gis archive is expected , even today , to provide the best opportunity to search for excess hard x - ray signals from groups of galaxies .",
    "its main drawback , namely the poor sensitivity for exclusion of contaminating point sources , can be compensated for by referring to the public data with higher angular resolution , such as rosat and chandra .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)figure1.eps    based on this idea , fukazawa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) analyzed the asca data of a compact galaxy group hcg 62 , and discovered evidence for a hard x - ray excess above the thermal igm emission .",
    "their approach is considered applicable not only to this particular group , but also to almost all near - by low temperature groups . in this paper",
    ", we hence study 18 near - by low temperature galaxy groups in the asca archive data . in section 2 , we present the list of targets with their selection criteria .",
    "section 3 describes the analysis method we employed .",
    "results from the analysis is summarized in section 4 .",
    "discussion is presented in section 5 , followed by a brief summary in the last section . throughout the present paper ,",
    "we assume the hubble constant to be @xmath11 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "all the errors refer to 90 % confidence levels , unless otherwise noted .",
    "we surveyed all the asca archival data for groups of galaxies that are appropriate for our purpose . to separate any additional hard components from the igm emission within the asca band - pass , we need targets with soft and bright igm emission . in addition",
    ", targets having near - by hard x - ray sources must be avoided , because the wide wing of the point spread function ( psf ) of the asca mirror degrades the sensitivity .",
    "we must avoid even hard sources outside the gis field of view , because they produce stray lights .",
    "we selected objects which has an igm temperature lower than 1.7 kev , and the 0.510 kev flux higher than @xmath12 erg s@xmath4 @xmath13 .",
    "we excluded objects with a luminosity less than @xmath14 erg s@xmath4 , most of which are isolated elliptical galaxies rather than groups : this is to reduce the hard x - ray contribution from unresolved discrete sources , such as low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "we also examined the rosat all sky map and other literature for the absence of nearby ( @xmath15 ) active galacitc nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the sample thus selected consists of 18 groups , including hcg 62 .",
    "we list them in table [ tbl : obs : tarlist ] together with their optical properties .",
    "although the sample is far from being complete , it includes variety of objects .",
    "there are three hickson s compact groups , another three ( ngc 1132 , ngc 1550 and ngc 6521 ) x - ray selected groups discovered by the rosat survey , and 11 relatively loose groups .",

    "we briefly compare it to other parameters of these objects .",
    "the calculated 210 kev luminosity of the power - law component , @xmath75 , is presented in table [ tbl : discussion : overall:1 ] , together with the 0.7 - 2.5 kev luminosity of the igm component ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "both the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 of the three objects are typical in our sample . in addition",
    ", some other objects in our sample have similar temperatures and igm luminosities to the three object , yet without excess hard signals .",
    "the lack of correlations to these parameters suggests that the phenomenon we have been studying is not likely to be artifacts caused by wrong background subtraction , or incorrect modeling of the igm contribution .",
    "an elliptical galaxy is known to emit an x - ray component with a rather hard spectrum , as a sum of discrete sources in it , such as lmxbs in particular ( canizares et al .",
    "1987 ; matsushita et al .  1994",
    "; matsushita et al .  2000 ) .",
    "this component could provide a possible explanation to the hard excess emission , because lmxb spectra , approximated by a thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath79 kev , are generally consistent with what has been observed in the present study .",
    "the integrated 210 kev discrete - source luminosity , @xmath80 , of each elliptical galaxy is known to be approximately proportional to its b - band luminosity , @xmath81 .",
    "we hence estimated @xmath80 in our sample objects , using @xmath81 given in table 1 and the relation of @xmath82 erg s@xmath4 ( converted from matsushita et al .",
    "the result , presented in figure [ fig : other : anaspec : excess : lxlb ] , shows that @xmath75 of hcg 62 , ngc 1399 and rgh 80 is 20 , 5 and 140 times higher than the estimated @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "thus , the discrete - source contribution can not explain away the hard - excess phenomenon .",
    "similar excess hard x - ray fluxes from a few virgo elliptical galaxies were reported by loewenstein et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .      even in the case of hcg 62 which shows the most significant hard x - ray excess , the spectral shape of the excess emission is not well constrained",
    "; @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , it is rather difficult to tell whether the emission is of thermal or non - thermal origin . in this section , we briefly discuss both scenarios , using hcg 62 as a representative case .      in the non - thermal scenario ,",
    "two possibilities are generally discussed : inverse compton ( ic ) emission from gev electrons as they scatter off the cosmic microwave background photons , and non - thermal bremsstrahlung from sub - relativistic particles interacting with ambient plasmas ( see e.g. sarazin 1999 and sarazin , kempner 2000 ) .",
    "however , the latter is unlikely , because of too low an efficiency ( e.g. petrosian 2001 ) ; sub - relativistic electrons suffer from 4 to 5 orders of magnitude larger energy loss in their coulomb interactions with ambient ions , than their bremsstrahlung loss , making the energetics unrealistic ( e.g. fukazawa et al .",
    "therefore , below we consider only the ic interpretation .    in the ic scenario , the postulated gev electrons should also emit synchrotron photons in the radio band .",
    "there is however no reported radio halo detection of hcg 62 , and the 365 mhz texas catalog ( douglas et al .",
    "1996 ) gives an upper limit of @xmath84 jy on the radio flux density from hcg 62 .",
    "the comparison of this upper limit with our @xmath85 erg s@xmath4 @xmath13 in the 2 - 10 kev band yields an upper limit on the volume - averaged magnetic field as @xmath86 g , assuming that a single population of electrons with an energy index of 3.0 are emitting both ic and synchrotron components under a uniform magnetic field . as already mentioned in fukazawa et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , this limit appears too low for intra - group magnetic fields .",
    "introduction of non - uniform magnetic fields and/or time evolution of the electron energy distribution ( e.g. high - energy cutoff ) may solve this discrepancy .",
    "for example , brunetti et al . ( 2001 ) proposed a model explaining the non - thermal signature of the coma cluster . in this cluster ,",
    "observed radio halo flux and the hard x - ray flux suggested by beppo - sax ( e.g. fuso - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ) leeds to a similarly low magnetic field ( @xmath87 g ) when a simple model for electron population is employed . by incorporating the radial dependence of magnetic field and assumed ( re)-acceleration power , as well as the time evolution , in particular introducing the re - acceleration phase which modifies the electron spectra flatter with distinctive cut - off , they successfully reproduced the coma results .",
    "similar models may be able to explain the hcg 62 results .    when @xmath88 g , the electrons are expected to lose their energies predominantly in the ic channel .",
    "therefore , to sustain @xmath89 erg s@xmath4 under a steady - state condition , a comparable energy input should be supplied to the electrons .",
    "the recent chandra detection of a pair of  x - ray cavities \" near the central galaxy ( ngc 4761 ) of hcg 62 ( vrtilek 2000 , morita et al .",
    "2006 ) suggests a past agn activity , which may well have supplied the needed energy input .",
    "although ngc  4761 currently shows little evidence of agn activity , the scenario remains intact if the putative agn activity continued till 1 gyr ago or later , because the cooling time of a 1 gev electron due to the ic process is @xmath90 gyr .",
    "since hcg 62 is a compact group with a high galaxy density and a rather large velocity dispersion of @xmath91 km s@xmath4 ( zabludoff , mulchaey 1998 ) , energy inputs may also be possible from magneto - hydrodynamic interactions of the member galaxies with the igm ( makishima et al .",
    "thus , the non - thermal interpretation is promising from the energetics view point .",
    "if the hard excess in our sample objects are interpreted as thermal emission , the inferred temperature ranges from @xmath92 3 kev or higher . in order to explain @xmath75 that amounts to up to 25%",
    "of @xmath93 , then the putative hotter gas must fill @xmath94% of the group volume , assuming that it is in a pressure balance with the @xmath92 1 kev igm .",
    "that is , the hotter gas is implied to be energetically dominant in the intra - group space . since the velocity dispersion of hcg 62 as quoted above translates to a virial temperature of only @xmath90 kev ( e.g. xue , wu , 2000 ) , the postulated gas is concluded to be significantly hotter than the gravitational potential felt by the galaxies .",
    "however , if the gas were gravitationally unbound and freely escaping with sound velocity , the necessary energy input would become enormous , because the escape time of a 2 kev gas is two orders of magnitude shorter than its radiative cooling time , assuming a representative density of @xmath95 @xmath96 .",
    "another possibility is that such an object is surrounded by a much deeper gravitational potential halo with a considerably larger scale .",
    "actually , the presence of such a large - scale halo has been suggested by matsushita et al .",
    "( 1998 ) around the elliptical galaxy ngc  4636 . in any case",
    ", the presence of such a hot gaseous component would have a profound impact on the structure and formation of galaxy groups .",
    "from the detailed analysis of the hard ( @xmath97 kev ) band x - ray spectra of groups of galaxies obtained with asca , evidence of excess hard x - ray emission has been suggested from 3 out of 18 objects investigated .",
    "they are hcg 62 , ngc 1399 and rgh 80 .",
    "the emission can not be explained by either fluctuations in the cxb brightness , the nxb estimation error , or contributions of point sources in the member galaxies .",
    "the excess can not be explained away by assuming a moderate temperature gradient in the igm , either . at least in hcg 62 ,",
    "the hard x - ray emission is as extended as the thermal igm emission .",
    "the observed excess hard x - ray emission can be modeled by a power law with photon index fixed at 2.0 , or a high - temperature thermal component , although it is difficult to distinguish them . if considered to be of non - thermal origin , the observed hard x - ray emission can be most reasonably interpreted as inverse - compton emission by gev electrons accelerated in these systems .",
    "in contrast , thermal interpretation of the phenomenon leads to an inference that some of groups of galaxies are surrounded by a much deeper ( and probably of larger - scale ) gravitational halo than those felt by the member galaxies .    in order to further promote the study",
    ", we may utilize the suzaku mission , launched into orbit on 10th july , 2005 .",
    "actually , the x - ray imaging spectrometer onboard the satellite has a 6 times larger effective area than the asca gis at 7 kev in total , and its background , when normalized to the solid angle and effective area , is only slightly higher than that of the gis ."
