    "electronic transport through molecular nanojunctions exhibits many important new features in comparison with conduction through macroscopic systems such as bulk or thin layers of semi - conducting molecular crystals as used in conventional molecular electronics .",
    "in particular , local interactions , such as coulomb interactions between the electrons and scattering from localized atomic vibrations , become critically important . in crude terms",
    ", these interactions are more pronounced in nanoscale systems because the electronic probability density is concentrated in a small region of space ; normal screening mechanisms are thus ineffective .",
    "developing a theory for the non - equilibrium  electronic quantum transport through such fully interacting nanoscale junctions is a challenging task , especially when thinking in terms of applications for future nanoscale electronics .    having a simple expression for the electronic current or for the conductance of a nanoscale object connected to terminals is most useful",
    "this is provided by the landauer formula @xcite in the form of an appealing intuitive physical picture , which describes the current in terms of local properties of a finite region ( transmission coefficients ) and the statistical distribution functions of the electron reservoirs connected to the central region @xmath0 . however , in its original form the landauer formula deals only with non - interacting electrons .",
    "this formalism has been used in conjunction with density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations for realistic nanoscale systems @xcite .",
    "it has helped tremendously for the qualitative understanding of the transport properties of such realistic systems , though only on a semi - quantitative level as the calculated conductance is often one or two orders of magnitude wrong .",
    "the apparent success of such an approach relies on the fact that dft maps the many - electron interacting system onto an effective non - interacting single - particle kohn - sham hamiltonian suited for the landauer scattering formalism for transport .",
    "however there are many cases when such a mapping becomes questionable : for strongly - interacting electron systems , low dimensional interacting electron system , strongly coupled electron - phonon systems , to cite only a few .",
    "furthermore , the single - particle framework of the landauer approach can not be directly transferred to the many - body context by expecting that a proper inclusion of many - body effects in the single - particle energy levels will suffice .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that there are many - body corrections to the landauer formula which can not be formulated in terms of single - particle transmission probabilities @xcite .    when a single - particle - like scheme is still valid even in the presence of interaction , the landauer approach can be extended to include inelastic effects by using inelastic scattering theory in a generalised fock - like space @xcite .    in the context of dft",
    ", it has also been shown that the exchange - correlation part of the interaction that leads to the presence of an extra @xmath1 potential is actually introducing corrections to the landauer - like current .",
    "these corrections are crucial and need to be taken into account when working with dft calculations @xcite .    the landauer formula has been built upon by meir and wingreen @xcite to extend this formalism to a central scattering region @xmath0 containing interactions between particles , while the left ( @xmath2 ) and right ( @xmath3 ) leads are still represented by non - interacting electron seas . the current is then expressed in terms of non - equilibrium green s functions ( negf ) and self - energies , and in the most general cases it does not bear any formal resemblance to the original landauer formula for the current @xcite .",
    "other generalizations of landauer - like approaches to include interactions and inelastic scattering have been developed , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , in real systems the interaction is present throughout the entire system , even at the nanoscale .",
    "this is even more true for the long - range coulomb interaction between bare electrons .",
    "hence it is difficult to consider that in the real system all kinds of interaction will stay localized or will be sufficiently well described by localized effective interaction in the @xmath0 region only .",
    "another reason is that in time - dependent transport , the external field in the leads may not necessarily be screened instantaneously .",
    "transient times can be of the same order as the plasma oscillation ( a collective many - body mode of charge oscillation ) period in leads and play an important role in the transient transport properties of the nanojunction @xcite .",
    "taking the interaction into the whole system is vital . to achieve this ,",
    "the so - called partition - free scheme has been developed @xcite .",
    "it allows in principle the calculation of physical dynamical responses and to include the interactions between the leads and between the leads and the central region in a quite natural way @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use an alternative approach , and generalize the meir and wingreen formalism ( so - called partitioned scheme ) to systems where interaction exists in all the @xmath4 , as well as at the interfaces between the three regions .",
    "since the choice of location of these interfaces is purely arbitrary and since the interactions exist at and on both sides of the interface , our approach is equivalent to a partition - free scheme .",
    "however , while keeping the approach and the negf formalism of the original work of meir and wingreen @xcite , we derive the most general expression of the current for the fully interacting system . from this , we can recover all previously derived transport expressions or corrections when introducing the appropriate level of approximation for the interaction .",
    "we also derive and study in detail the current conservation condition and the constraint that it imposes on the interaction self - energies .",
    "our formalism also introduces naturally the generalization of the concept of the embedding potential when the interaction crosses at the boundaries . with this new concept and with the condition of current conservation",
    ", we can explore different levels of approximation for treating the interaction in the different parts of the system , as well as at the interface .",
    "we can then check which approximations are more suitable for practical numerical calculations of realistic systems .    although a preliminary account of our formalism is already given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we provide here the full detail of the derivation and a much more detailed discussion of the physical meaning of our results as well as of the implementation of the present formalism for realistic calculations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we start with the description of the system and the notation in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "then we derive the expression for the current for the fully interacting system in section [ sec : negftransport ] .",
    "we provide the full derivation of the expressions for the different green s functions   needed to calculate the current in section [ sec : differentgfs ] .",
    "we derive the conditions imposed by the constraint of current conservation in section [ sec : currentconserv ] .",

    "we recall some properties of the green s functions  and self - energies  in [ app : ccgfs ] and b , and provide the proof of an important relation for the current conservation is given in [ app : gamma_proof ] .",
    "the system consists of two electrodes , labelled @xmath2 and @xmath3 for left and right respectively , which connect a central region @xmath0 via a set of coupling matrix elements @xmath5 . the interaction  which we specifically leave undefined ( e.g. electron - electron or electron - phonon)is assumed to be well described in terms of the single - particle self - energy @xmath6 and spreads over the entire system .    for the calculation of the current ,",
