    "heteroepitaxial growth has been a field of intense study in recent years .",
    "this is mainly due to the improved performance of semiconductor and opto - electronic devices which can be achieved using strained layer epitaxy . here",
    "the heteroepitaxial growth by depositing material onto a substrate with the same crystal structure as the adsorbate but a slightly different lattice constant is of special interest .    in the early stages of this kind of heteroepitaxial growth",
    "the adsorbate is coherent with the substrate . in this state",
    "the crystal topology is that of a perfect crystal , _",
    "i.e. _ each particle has the same coordination number and its nearest and next - nearest neighbors form the same geometrical figure with only slightly modified distances @xcite .    as the thickness of the adsorbate film increases the elastic energy of the film rises until it is energetically favorable to form dislocations in order to relieve the strain .",
    "in this new incoherent state the crystal topology is perturbed near the substrate / adsorbate interface .",
    "the thickness of the adsorbate film at which this occurs is called the _",
    "critical layer thickness _ @xmath1 .",

    "we determine the critical layer thickness as a function of the misfit between the lattice constants of the substrate and the adsorbate using computer simulations .    in order to simulate heteroepitaxial growth",
    "one has to overcome the limitations of a fixed lattice .",
    "one obvious way to perform off - lattice simulations are molecular dynamics ( md ) , see for instance @xcite in the context of misfit dislocations .",
    "md methods have the advantage of conceptual simplicity but can only be applied to rather small system sizes at very high temperature and deposition rates . because of the high computational efforts the critical layer thickness has been determined for only a few values of the misfit .    here , we propose a kmc algorithm for the simulation of the early stages of heteroepitaxial growth .",
    "in contrast to similar off - lattice algorithms suggested before - for example by faux _",
    "@xcite , plotz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite or schindler @xcite - we are able to simulate heteroepitaxial growth for rather thick adsorbate layers and over a wide range of the misfit between the lattice constants of the substrate and the adsorbate .",
    "in the following we consider only growth in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "however , the method can be extended to @xmath3 dimensional growth . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that the critical layer thickness for the appearance of dislocations is observed in monte carlo simulations .",
    "we find that our results fit well to a power law , as it has been observed for several semiconductor compounds @xcite .",
    "the aim here is to gain general insight into relevant mechanisms of heteroepitaxial growth .",
    "we therefore choose a simple _ lennard - jones _ potential @xmath4.\\ ] ] as particle interaction , which is numerically easy to handle and saves computer time compared to more realistic empirical potentials like the eam approximation ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",

    "the equilibrium distance @xmath5 between two isolated particles interacting via @xmath6 becomes @xmath7{2}\\sigma$ ] and is slightly smaller in the bulk material . because of the isotropy of the lennard - jones potential the particles arrange in a triangular lattice . in order to save computer time",
    "the interaction potential @xmath6 is cut off at a distance @xmath8 .",

    "distance @xmath15 .",
    "there are two possible events in our simulations : deposition and diffusion of _ adsorbate _ particles .",
    "the two - dimensional simulation cell is open in vertical and has periodic boundary conditions in lateral direction .",

    "the rate @xmath19 for a diffusion event @xmath13 is given by an arrhenius law @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the attempt frequency , the activation barrier for the diffusion step @xmath13 and the simulation temperature , respectively .",

    "both are calculated for a frozen crystal using brent s method @xcite . here",
    "the saddle point search for the calculation of @xmath25 can be replaced by a simpler maximum search in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "+ to consider the elastic deformation of the crystal after each microscopic event ( diffusion or deposition ) the total potential energy of the @xmath27 particles - system @xmath28 is minimized using a conjugate gradient method @xcite under variation of the coordinates of all particles ( substrate and adsorbate ) within a circle of radius @xmath29 around the particle where the event took place . in order to avoid strain caused by this local relaxation of the crystal , after a distinct number of microscopic events - depending on the misfit @xmath0 - a minimization of @xmath30 under variation of all particle coordinates",

    "unlike in standard monte carlo simulations time does not advance linearly in discrete time steps @xmath33 .",
    "instead the time interval @xmath34 between two microscopic processes is randomly drawn from a poisson distribution @xmath35 by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 .",

    "is chosen between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , so we can simulate heteroepitaxial growth for misfits @xmath44 between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "= 0.79    = 0.79    in the following the temperature is set to @xmath47 , which is sufficiently low compared to the melting temperature @xmath48 of a pure two - dimensional lennard - jones solid @xcite .",
    "heteroepitaxial growth is now simulated in order to determine the critical layer thickness @xmath1 for the appearance of dislocations as a function of the misfit @xmath0 .",
    "+ to this end between 5 and 10 independent simulation runs are carried out for each value of @xmath0 .",
    "we find that in each simulation run several dislocations appear simultaneously .",
    "then , after the deposition of a few monolayers of adsorbate after the first appearance of a dislocations in the crystal the number of dislocations remains constant .",
    "the thickness of the adsorbate layer at which dislocations first appear is registered as @xmath49 .    to prove the existence of a dislocation we determine the coordination number @xmath50 of each particle by calculating the voronoy polyhedra @xcite .",
    "voronoy polyhedra are a generalization of the wigner - seitz cell to a system without a fixed lattice .",
    "the number of sides of a voronoy polyhedron gives the coordination number @xmath50 ( @xmath51 for a particle in a perfect triangular lattice ) .",

    "figure [ diszahl ] shows the number of dislocations per unit length @xmath55 counted for each value of @xmath0 about 6 monolayers deposited adsorbate after the first appearance of a dislocation in the crystal ( the maximum number of dislocations should be reached for this thickness of the adsorbate layer ) .",
    "the dashed line gives the theoretical number of dislocations in a system of size @xmath17 under the assumption that @xmath56 perfect dislocations can appear .",
    "_ perfect dislocations _ ( fig .",
    "[ pandp ] left panel ) are those for which the crystal topology far from the substrate / adsorbate interface is the same as in the coherent state and the burgers vector is therefore an integer multiple of the lattice vector .",
    "the formation of partial dislocations ( fig . [ pandp ] right panel ) - characterized by a burgers vector which is a rational fraction of a lattice vector - causes the deviations from the theoretical results for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is due to the fact , that partial dislocations are spatially more extended than perfect dislocations .",
    "for this reason in the case @xmath59 more and for @xmath60 less dislocations than @xmath56 have to be built when partial dislocations appear . why partial dislocations only appear for distinct values of @xmath0",

    "+ the simulation results show a dependence of @xmath1 on the sign of the misfit .",
    "this was found before by l. dong _",
    "we believe this dependence is due to the fact , that the lennard - jones potential is not harmonic . the potential is steeper in compression ( @xmath62 ) than in tension ( @xmath63 ) , so that for @xmath62 it becomes favorable to form a dislocation for smaller values of @xmath1 .",
