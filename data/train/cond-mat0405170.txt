    "pairing of cooper pairs in frustrated josephson junction arrays was theoretically proposed recently  @xcite in the search of topologically protected nontrivial quantum liquid states .",
    "the simplest system where such a phenomenon could be observed was proposed by doucot and vidal in  @xcite .",
    "it consists of a chain of rhombi ( each of them being small ring of 4 superconductive islands connected by 4 josephson junctions ) placed into transverse magnetic field .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that in the fully frustrated case ( i.e. magnetic flux through each rhombus @xmath7 ) usual tunnelling of cooper pairs along the chain is blocked due to destructive inteference of tunneling going through two paths within the same rhombus , while correlated 2-cooper - pair transport survives .",
    "evidently , experimental observation of such a phenomenon ( detected as anomalous period @xmath8 of the global supercurrent along the chain ) would be very desirable . however , theoretical results of ref .",
    "@xcite refer to the situation when coulomb energy is determined by self - capacitances @xmath9 of individual superconductive islands , whereas in real submicron josephson - junction arrays capacitances of _ junctions _ @xmath10 dominate , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we reconsider the model of ref .",
    "@xcite for the experimentally relevant situation @xmath11 .",
    "this case is also simpler for theoretical treatment , since lagragian of the system becomes a sum of terms , such that each of them belongs to individual rhombus only .",
    "the only source of coupling between different rhombi is the periodic boundary condition along the chain .",
    "the method to treat similar problem was developed recently by matveev , larkin and glazman  @xcite ( mlg ) .",
    "they considered simple chain of @xmath12 josephson junctions in the closed - ring geometry , and reduced calculation of supercurrent in large-@xmath12 limit to the solution of a schredinger equation for a particle moving in a periodic potential @xmath13 , with appropriate boundary condition .",
    "mlg assumed ( we will do the same ) that josephson energy @xmath14 of junctions is large compared to their charging energy @xmath15 .",
    "we will generalize the mlg method in order to use it for the case of ring of rhombi .",
    "it will be shown that in our case fictitios particle of the mlg theory is still moving in the @xmath16-like potential , but it acquires now large _ spin _",
    "@xmath17 , where @xmath12 is the number of rhombi in the ring . in the maximally frustrated case",
    "@xmath18 the @xmath19-projection of the spin is an integral of motion , which should be chosen to minimize the total energy . as a result , @xmath20 and",
    "the whole problem reduces to the one studied by mlg up to trivial redefinition of parameters . in this situation ground - state energy and supercurrent ( which is proportional to derivative of the ground - state energy over total flux @xmath21 )",
    "are periodic function of @xmath21 with period @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath2-transport takes place .",
    "nonzero flux deviation @xmath23 produces longitudinal field @xmath24 coupled to the @xmath25-component of spin of fictitios particle , which acquires now nontrivial dynamics .",
    "we show that in the limit of sufficiently long rhombi chain the whole problem can be analyzed in terms of semiclassical dynamics of a particle with a large spin under spin - dependent potential barrier . in general",
    ", there are two tunnelling trajectories , one of them corresponds to usual @xmath4 transport , whereas another to @xmath2 transport . comparing actions of these trajectories for different @xmath23",
    ", we find critical flux deflection @xmath26 as function of the ratio @xmath27 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we define our model and identify its classical states ; in sec .",
    "iii we derive effective hamiltonian which governs quantum phase slip processes and calculate supercurrent as function of the flux deflection @xmath26 ; in sec .",
    "iv we consider current - bias chain with @xmath28 and calculate voltage @xmath29 via the rate of incoherent quantum phase slips .",
    "our conclusions and suggestions for the experiment are presented in sec .",
    "v. finally , in appendix a somewhat tedious calculation of current - phase relation is presented .",
    "we study a chain of @xmath12 rhombi shown in fig .",
    "[ chain ] .",
    "each rhombi consists of four superconductive islands connected by tunnel junctions with josephson coupling energy @xmath30 ; charging energy @xmath31 is determined by capacitance @xmath10 of junctions , @xmath32 ( we neglect self - capacitances of islands which are assumed to be much smaller than @xmath10 ) . below we consider josephson current along the chain of @xmath33 rhombi and",
    "assume that the chain is of the ring shape , with total magnetic flux @xmath21 inside the ring .",
    "we also denote by @xmath0 the flux per elementary rhombus plaquette and define phases @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the superconducting flux quantum .",
    "we study the situation than @xmath38 is close to @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "assuming that the charge transport through the system at @xmath40 is carried out by charges @xmath2 , we expect that in this case dependence of the current in the chain on the external flux @xmath21 is periodic with period @xmath22 . below we calculate the @xmath22-periodic current at @xmath40 .",
    "we also show that at small @xmath41 the current through the system has two components @xmath42 and @xmath43 with periods @xmath22 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the first component corresponds to the current carried by pairs of cooper pairs and the second one corresponds to the single cooper pair transport . at very small",
    "@xmath41 the current @xmath42 dominates over @xmath43 .",
    "we will refer to this regime as to @xmath2-regime . at large enough @xmath41 the opposite situation ( @xmath4-regime )",
    "is realized .",
    "we will find below the crossover point @xmath44 between these two regimes .",
    "the system is described by the following imaginary - time action @xmath45 here the variable @xmath46 is the phase difference across the @xmath47-th junction in the @xmath48-th rhombus ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . taking into account that each rhombus is pierced by flux @xmath0 and the flux through the whole chain is @xmath21 we derive the following additional conditions @xmath49 @xmath50    in this paper we consider the case of strong coupling between grains @xmath51 .",
    "this enables us to use semi - classical approximation for calculating the energy spectrum of the system . at @xmath52",
    "the phases @xmath46 become classical variables and the energy states of the chain can be found by minimizing the sum of josephson energy terms in action  ( [ basic_action ] ) .",
    "let us introduce variables @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the phase difference along the diagonal of the @xmath48-th rhombus .",
    "it is convenient to make minimization in two steps .",
    "first of all the josephson energy of a single rhombus under the fixed flux through the rhombus and under the fixed phase difference @xmath54 is minimized . for the josephson energy of the chain",
    "we then get for @xmath55 : @xmath56 @xmath57 plus and minus signs in ( [ beta_n ] ) correspond to positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) values of @xmath58 .",
    "here we have introduced an important notation @xmath59 .",
    "it can be easily shown that at @xmath40 each individual rhombus has two classical ground states with equal energies .",
    "this states differ only in the sign of the superconducting current circulating around the plaquette which corresponds to the binary variable @xmath60 .",
    "now we have to minimize the energy ( [ e_under_fixed_theta_n ] ) with respect to phases @xmath61 subject to the constrains ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath41 to be small and @xmath12 to be large we get @xmath62 here @xmath47 is an arbitrary integer ( which has the same meaning as in the mlg paper  @xcite ) and @xmath63 in the above equation @xmath64 can be considered as @xmath25-projection of the `` spin '' @xmath65 which describes binary degeneracy of states of the @xmath48-th rhombi .",
    "then @xmath66 corresponds to the @xmath25-projection of the total large spin @xmath67 describing the whole rhombi chain .",
    "for clarity everywhere in this paper we will refer to the case of even number of rhombi .",
    "then total spin @xmath68 and eigenvalues of its projection @xmath69 are integer .",
    "classical states of the chain are characterized by individual spin projections @xmath60 for each rhombus , and by collective integer - valued variable @xmath47 .",
    "we will denote these states by @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "physically , classical state of the chain is characterized by the global current @xmath72 along the chain , and by the signs of local currents flowing in each of @xmath12 rhombi .",
    "nonzero charging energy @xmath31 provides quantum phase slips in each of @xmath73 josephson junction ; these processes mix different classical states leading to formation of the fully quantum ground state .",
    "below we derive effective hamiltonian acting on the space of classical states , and find ground - state energy @xmath74 and corresponding supercurrent .",
    "as a function of @xmath75 . ]    we turn to analysis of quantum fluctuations of @xmath61 at finite @xmath31 .",
    "the most important type of these fluctuations involve an instanton ( quantum phase slip , qps ) , i.e. a trajectory that begin at one of the minima  ( [ e_under_flux_dif_from_pi ] ) of the potential energy in action  ( [ basic_action ] ) at @xmath76 and ends at another minima at @xmath77 .",
    "there are two kinds of trajectories : the first starts at @xmath78 and ends at @xmath79 for arbitrary @xmath80 , @xmath81 , whereas the second start at @xmath78 and end at @xmath82 for arbitrary @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "any trajectory of the first kind corresponds to qps in @xmath85 or @xmath86 , whereas trajectory of the second kind corresponds to qps @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "note that at @xmath40 and @xmath89 all these trajectories starting at @xmath90 with @xmath91 connect the minima with equal energies .",
    "thus they are important for restoring symmetry of the system which is classically broken .",
    "let us denote as @xmath92 the amplitude of a qps in one contact . at large @xmath33",
    "this amplitude does not differ from the `` spin flip '' amplitude for a single rhombus at @xmath93 . in this approximation",
    "we can use result from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a numerical factor of the order of unity .",
    "comparison with direct numerical diagonalization  @xcite of of low - lying spectrum of a single frustrated rhombi shows that coefficient @xmath95 grows from approximately 1.3 to 1.44 as the ratio @xmath5 varies from @xmath96 to infinity , cf .",
    "[ k_fig ] . the instantons account for the possibility of the system tunneling between different minima  ( [ e_under_flux_dif_from_pi ] ) of the potential energy in action  ( [ basic_action ] )",
    ". the effect of the instantons on the ground state energy can be represented by a tight - binding hamiltonian defined as @xmath97    to find the ground state energy @xmath98 it is convenient to make fourier transformation over variable @xmath47 according to @xmath99 note that not all vectors of our new basis  ( [ fure ] ) are independent .",
    "it is easy to see from  ( [ fure ] ) that @xmath100 . considering any system s state of the form @xmath101",
    "we should impose on the wavefunction @xmath102 a twisted boundary condition @xmath103 here we have introduced operator @xmath104 acting on the spin variables of the system according to standart rules .",
    "the resulting schrdinger equation acquires the form @xmath105 where @xmath106    note that symmetry group of the hamiltonian corresponding to the equation  ( [ main_res_under_flux_dif_from_pi ] ) includes transformations @xmath107 . here",
    "@xmath108 is operator of the translation over distance @xmath109 along the @xmath19-axis .",
    "equation  ( [ boundary ] ) shows that the parameter @xmath110 specifies different irreducible representations of the symmetry group .",
    "the equations  ( [ main_res_under_flux_dif_from_pi],[boundary ] ) allow comprehensive analytical investigation for the case when the flux per single rhombus equals @xmath22 .",
    "for such a system @xmath111 and the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath112 .",
    "however , variables @xmath19 and @xmath68 are still coupled due to boundary condition  ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "therefore we look for wavefunction in the form @xmath113    then for @xmath114 we get standard mathieu equation : @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "boundary condition  ( [ boundary ] ) now reads as follows : @xmath117 the ground state of the system defined by eqs .",
    "( [ main_res_for_delta_eq_zero ] , [ x_dependent_boundary ] ) corresponds to maximal absolute value of @xmath118 , equal to @xmath119 . in other words , in the ground state all rhombi in the chain are either in symmetric superpositions or in antisymmetric superpositions , of their double - degenerate classical states .",
    "thus there are two degenerate eigenstates @xmath120 with the same lowest energy @xmath121 .",
    "this degeneracy is a direct consequence of the fact that for @xmath111 ( fully frustrated chain ) the hamiltonian has two symmetry operators @xmath112 and @xmath122 which do not commute with each other ( thus double - degeneracy refers to all states , not only to the ground - state ) .",
    "eigenstates @xmath123 constitute a basis where @xmath124 operator is diagonal . coming back to the original problem defined by eqs.([boundary ] , [ main_res_under_flux_dif_from_pi ] )",
    "we note , that in accordance with  ( [ wave_func ] ) the correct ( unique ) eigenstate obeying eq.([boundary ] ) can be constructed as specific linear combination of @xmath125 and @xmath126 : @xmath127 which diagonalize operator @xmath122 .",
    "the eigenstate @xmath128 is similar to the eigenstates @xmath129 of ref .",
    "@xcite , cf .",
    "eq.(5 ) of that paper .",
    "it follows from the boundary condition  ( [ x_dependent_boundary ] ) that shift of the phase @xmath110 by @xmath130 does not change the boundary problem defined by eqs .",
    "( [ main_res_for_delta_eq_zero ] , [ x_dependent_boundary ] ) .",
    "thus the ground - state energy of the system and the supercurrent through the circuit are periodic functions of the flux @xmath21 with period @xmath22 .    at @xmath131 fluctuations are weak , the amplitude of potential energy in  ( [ main_res_for_delta_eq_zero ] ) is small and its effect is most significant when @xmath132 is integer and the energy levels @xmath133 are degenerate . in this regime",
    "the usual approximation for semiclassical weak link is valid , and for the persistent current through the circuit we obtain @xmath134 phase - dependent current @xmath135 is described by equation  ( [ weak_fl ] ) for @xmath136 and is a periodic function of @xmath110 with period @xmath130 .",
    "so in the regime of weak fluctuations the dependence @xmath135 demonstrates sawtooth behavior slightly rounded due to fluctuations .",
    "the opposite limit @xmath137 corresponds to the regime of strong fluctuations . in this case",
    "the dependence of the eigenvalue @xmath138 on the phase @xmath110 is exponentially weak  @xcite : @xmath139 and for the persistent current in the ground state we find @xmath140 equation ( [ i(0.5 ) ] ) , together with eq.([upsilon_gen ] ) , presents one of our main results : it gives the amplitude of @xmath2 - periodic josepshson current in the regime of maximal frustration .",
    "let us now turn to the investigation of the general situation described by equations  ( [ main_res_under_flux_dif_from_pi ] ) and  ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "as was mentioned above if the flux per elementary plaquette differs slightly from half supercondicting flux quantum the persistent current through the chain has two components @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in the regime of strong fluctuations both",
    "these currents are exponentially small .",
    "the main exponential factors in the expressions for them can be found on the basis of equation  ( [ main_res_under_flux_dif_from_pi ] ) using the semi - classical approximation .",
    "note that equation  ( [ main_res_under_flux_dif_from_pi ] ) corresponds to a particle of mass @xmath141 with spin @xmath68 moving in one - dimensional potential @xmath142 the particle energy being @xmath143 .",
    "so denoting by @xmath144 and @xmath145 the angels determining the spin direction , we can write the imaginary time tunneling amplitude in the form of path integral  @xcite @xmath146 for our future purposes it is more convenient to use the above path integral in another form also derived in  @xcite : @xmath147    we will analyse the expression  ( [ basic_path_integral_for_spin_system_for_lin ] ) for the limit of relatively large @xmath41 when @xmath148 . in this regime",
    "the field @xmath149 in  ( [ basic_potential_for_spin_system ] ) fixes the direction of @xmath150 so that @xmath112 and @xmath151 are always small .",
    "therefore we can linearize the action in  ( [ basic_path_integral_for_spin_system ] ) with respect to @xmath112 and @xmath151 .",
    "after linearization we can easily exclude the variable @xmath151 using the equations of motion .",
    "the substitution of variables @xmath152 , @xmath153 leads to the path integral @xmath154 where the action @xmath155 @xmath156 the appropriate equations of motion are @xmath157 @xmath158    using semi - classical approximation we should first determine the classical minima of the potential  ( [ effektive_potential ] ) . within the same limit @xmath148",
    "we find that @xmath159 has two groups of minima ( we call them `` even '' and `` odd '' minima ) @xmath160 @xmath161 where @xmath48 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "all these minima correspond to the same value of @xmath162 .",
    "so we have to consider two types of tunnelling trajectories .",
    "trajectories of the first type connect minima of the same group , i.e. `` even - even '' and `` odd - odd '' , and corresponding variation of the variable @xmath19 between minima is @xmath163 , whereas @xmath164 returns to its original value .",
    "trajectories of the second type connect minima of opposite parity ( i.e. opposite signs of @xmath164 ) , and change @xmath19 variable by @xmath165 .",
    "it is not difficult to see from eqs.([fure],[main_res_under_flux_dif_from_pi],[boundary ] ) , that increment @xmath166 of the variable @xmath19 along tunnelling trajectory is in one - to - one correspondence to the elementary charge transported along the rhombi chain : @xmath167 .",
    "therefore trajectories of the first type lead to @xmath2 - supercurrent , whereas trajectories of the second type produces usual @xmath4-quantized supercurrent .",
    "the amplitudes of the supercurrent components are determined ( cf .",
    "appendix for the direct derivation ) primarily by the classical actions on corresponding trajectories : @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 and @xmath171 are the values of tunnelling actions on trajectories of the first and second type respectively . both @xmath170 and @xmath171",
    "are large in the region of strong fluctuations @xmath172 , thus the total supercurrent will in general be dominated by least - action processes .",
    "to compare actions @xmath170 and @xmath171 we note that the dynamical system  ( [ equation_for_x_aft_subst ] ) and  ( [ equation_for_y_aft_subst ] ) has two characteristic frequencies .",
    "the first one characterises `` spin '' subsystem with @xmath173 , whereas the second one is the frequency of the `` x '' subsystem , @xmath174 , since typical value of @xmath164 in  ( [ equation_for_x_aft_subst ] ) is  @xmath175 .",
    "therefore at @xmath176 - i.e. at sufficiently large flux deflections @xmath41 , the `` spin variable '' @xmath164 is fast and can be integrated out in adiabatic approximation , which leads to @xmath177 @xmath178 the dominant process is thus usual @xmath4 transfer .",
    "comparing the action  ( [ small_d_action_with_x ] ) with the action corresponding to the shrdinger equation  ( [ main_res_for_delta_eq_zero ] ) @xmath179 and using  ( [ bqphi ] ) we obtain supercurrent amplitude @xmath180 at small flux deflection @xmath41 the parameter @xmath181 and the spin variable @xmath164 is relatively slow and almost does not change on the type-1 trajectory .",
    "the dominant trajectory is then @xmath2-one .",
    "assuming @xmath164 to be constant , we get @xmath182 taking into account also the first - order term of perturbation theory over @xmath183 , we find @xmath184 .",
    "comparison of the action  ( [ large_d_action_with_x ] ) with  ( [ s_e^0 ] ) and  ( [ bqphi ] ) allows us to determine the pre - exponential factor in the expression for the current @xmath185 note that at @xmath41 determined from the equation @xmath186 ( where the linear approximation used to describe the spin degree of freedom fails ) , the @xmath2-current from  ( [ i4e ] ) matches the exact result for @xmath40 presented in  ( [ i(0.5 ) ] ) .    in the intermediate region of @xmath187",
    "we analyse equations ( [ linearized_action ] ) ,  ( [ equation_for_x_aft_subst ] ) and  ( [ equation_for_y_aft_subst ] ) numerically .",
    "first we write @xmath170 and @xmath171 in the form @xmath188 , @xmath189 .",
    "then the functions @xmath190 and @xmath191 depending on a single parameter @xmath175 have been evaluated numerically .",
    "the result is presented on fig .",
    "[ both_actions ] .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath190 ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "the actions for both types of trajectories are equal at @xmath192 , where we have @xmath193 .",
    "thus the crossover between @xmath2-regime and @xmath4-regime takes place at @xmath194 varying flux @xmath0 in some vicinity of crossover point ( [ crossover ] ) one can find both @xmath4 and @xmath2 components of supercurrent , but their relative weight is expected to vary strongly with @xmath195 , in some analogy with phase coexistence near first - order phase transition .",
    "in previous section we obtained estimates ( [ weak_fl],[i(0.5)],[i2e],[i4e ] ) for the equilibrium supercurrent @xmath196 around the _ flux - biased _ rhombi chain with @xmath33 . note that the maximum value of this supercurrent is small , compared to individual critical current of a single junction @xmath197 , even in the case of weak quantum fluctuations , cf .",
    "eq.([weak_fl ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that in our analysis we have considered perfectly equilibrium josepshson current , which must be @xmath198-periodic as function of the total phase bias @xmath34 .",
    "therefore in the long chain phase differences across each rhombi scales as @xmath199 , leading to @xmath200 in weak - fluctuation limit @xmath201 ( in the opposite limit @xmath202 is small exponentially in @xmath12 ) .",
    "it is clear , however , that under the condition of some _ current bias _",
    ", with a fixed @xmath203 , the chain will be in some `` nearly superconducting '' state with a very low voltage , due to rare phase slip processes . below we consider regime of relatively large currents ( the condition to be specified below ) , when the processes of tunnelling in different rhombi are incoherent . in this case mean voltage @xmath204 along the whole chain",
    "can be estimated just as @xmath12 times the voltage along a single rhombus . below we estimate probability per unit time of an individual qps in a single rhombus at the fixed transport current @xmath205 , and find the @xmath29 dependence .",

    "all these states are metastable and have finite decay time  @xmath218 .    within the semi - classical approximation ( valid for @xmath51 ) the decay time @xmath218",
    "is determined by vicinity of a bounce i.e. a classical trajectory starting at a minimum of the potential energy  ( [ fission_potential ] ) coming close to another one and then going back to the first minimum  @xcite . to be specific",
    "we will refer here to the decay rate of a state corresponding to @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "decay of this state goes via one of two possible bounce trajectories ( for @xmath222 ) .",
    "one of them passes near @xmath221 , @xmath223 and @xmath220 while the other passes near @xmath221 , @xmath224 and @xmath220 .",
    "both these bounces give equal contribution to the decay rate .",
    "let us denote by @xmath225  the three - dimensional column - vector in the coordinate space of the rhombus .",
    "we also introduce @xmath226 as the trajectory corresponding to the system being at the minimum of the potential  ( [ fission_potential ] ) and @xmath227 as the bounce trajectory which can be determined by solving the classical equations of motion .",

    "the function @xmath234 depending on the only parameter @xmath235 can be evaluated numerically by solving the lagrangian equations for the action  ( [ fission_action ] ) with the appropriate boundary conditions .",

    "]    let us assume that the current @xmath72 is not very small so that the energy difference @xmath236 between two nearest minima of the potential  ( [ fission_potential ] ) is much larger than the quantum amplitude for a phase slip @xmath92 introduced above , i.e. we assume that @xmath237 . in this case transitions within each rhombus between the states corresponding to different minima of the potential  ( [ fission_potential ] )",
    "are incoherent .",
    "total voltage along the chain can be expressed in terms of @xmath218 as @xmath238 since during each jump of the system from one minimum to another the phase @xmath144 changes by  @xmath130 .",
