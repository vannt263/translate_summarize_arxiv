    "however , the holonomy correction dominates over the inverse volume correction for a universe with a large scale factor , and thus the latter can be neglected without harm .",
    "therefore , we only consider the holonomy correction in this paper .    currently , tachyon matter has not been thoroughly investigated in loop quantum cosmology(lqc ) .",

    "based on the holonomy correction in loop quantum cosmology , the modified friedmann equation of a flat@xmath7 friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hubble parameter , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the matter density and critical density , respectively .",

    "in fact , as @xmath102 the phase plane projection becomes @xmath103 asymptotically .",
    "the equilibrium points or fixed points @xmath104 are solutions acquired by setting @xmath105 according to lyapunov s theory of stability , the stability of a fixed point can be determined by the property of the linearized system about it .",
    "the linearization is done by expanding eq.([xyz ] ) about the fixed points and keeping only the linear parts .",
    "after that , one can obtain a matrix @xmath106 at each fixed point . if the all the eigenvalues of ( [ matrix ] ) for a fixed point have negative real parts , the fixed point is ( locally ) exponentially stable .",
    "however , if there exist one or more eigenvalues which have positive real parts , then the fixed point is unstable . in both stable and unstable cases ,",
    "the fixed point is a node if the eigenvalues are all real , otherwise it will be a spiral point . furthermore , the fixed point is called saddle point if the eigenvalues have both positive and negative real parts .",
    "we found up to 5 fixed points for eq.([xyz ] ) , their properties are listed in table i , where @xmath107    the physical requirements mentioned before also set restrictions on the existence and stability of these fixed points.by considering @xmath108 , we found @xmath109 where @xmath110 , which indicates the two eigenvalues of @xmath111 with seemingly complicated square root part are definitely real and nonpositive .",

    "there are only four fixed points in the system , and @xmath113 , as a stable node , is the only attractor in the system .",

    "the position of @xmath111 is located on a straight line on the x - y plane described by @xmath116 and in the limit case @xmath117 , it will coincide with @xmath118 .",
    "from table i we can see that all the fixed points locate at @xmath119 , where the energy density vanishes and the lqc modification term @xmath36 becomes unimportant .",
    "we have proved in last section that the the physically possible phase plane projection on @xmath101 plane becomes @xmath103 asymptotically .",
    "therefore for the late time evolution , it is sufficient for us to investigate the phase projection on the @xmath101 plane at small @xmath79 by noting that @xmath79 monotonously decreases as @xmath5 or @xmath72 increases , which we can easily read from eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) . in the previous section ,",
    "we have proved that there is at most one stable point in our model , then nearly all solutions will end there ( see figs.[fig-2 ] and [ fig-3 ] ) .",
    "this attracting behavior allows us to investigate the properties of late time evolution near the attractor , regardless of the history before it .",

    ", the universe will end up in deceleration if @xmath136 .",
    "an interesting possibility is to see tachyon field as a combination of two parts @xcite , which behave like a pressureless dust ( dark matter , denoted by lower case @xmath137 ) and a cosmological constant(dark energy , denoted by lower case @xmath138 ) , respectively : @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 in this way , dark matter and dark energy originate from a same scalar field , and the dynamics of tachyon field becomes a description of their dynamics and interaction .",
    "the ratio between the two parts is @xmath142 the proportion of dark matter rises as @xmath143 increases . if the barotropic fluid is radiation@xmath144 , then , by the virtue of the attractor solution , it is possible to have a trajectory that goes from the radiation dominated era to the matter dominated era , and then to the dark energy dominated regime .",
    "radiation should dominate first , that is @xmath145 .",
    "then , to have the universe dominated by matters described by tachyon field after the era dominated by radiation , that is @xmath146 , we need the trajectory to stay close to the boundary of the phase plane , i.e. @xmath147 , or @xmath148 because @xmath79 is very small . to have a sufficient long matter dominated era before dark energy",
    "take over , we just need the trajectory to stay close to the saddle point @xmath149 after radiation s domination .",
    "therefore we will rule out the trajectories which are far away from the boundary of the phase plane in following discussion .",
    "the negative / positive branch , which starts near @xmath150/@xmath151 , will show a quite different evolution , because the attractor only lies in the right half of the phase plane and therefore the negative branch will have to get across to arrive at the attractor . the cosmological consequence will also be quite different .",
    "for the positive branch , the ratio of dark energy will increase as @xmath39 decreases .",
    "if the attractor is inflationary ( @xmath152 ) , the allowed trajectories can go naturally into the dark energy dominated regime that leads to acceleration . while if the attractor is not inflationary(@xmath136 )",
    ", acceleration will not take place because @xmath39 decreases almost monotonously for the feasible trajectories which are close to the boundary .",
    "on the other hand , for the negative branch , the universe will definitely enter a dark energy dominated regime that leads to acceleration when @xmath153 , or @xmath154 , since the trajectories will get across from the left half to the right half .",
    "note that , for the negative branch , the universe is not expanding in the power - law way we described before when it first gets into the acceleration regime @xmath155 .",
    "when @xmath156 , dark energy dominates completely .",
    "after that , the ratio of matter increases again , and the final state of universe will(or will not ) be inflationary if @xmath152(or @xmath136 ) .",
    "so there is possibility that we are just currently living in a transitory accelerating period and the acceleration rate can change according to the dynamics of the tachyon field .",
    "previous works on tachyon cosmology in spatially flat frw universe showed a purely tachyonic matter with an inverse square potential @xmath157 leads to a power - law expansion @xcite . in lqc scenario , although it is hard to find a exact solution , the expansion of universe is nearly a power - law one when @xmath158 is small . when the tachyon field is coupled with a barotropic perfect fluid with @xmath0 , we are able to find two kinds of stable nodes which exist exclusively to each other and represent different cosmological situations .",
    "the tracker solution exists for @xmath159 , while the tachyon dominated solution exists for @xmath160 .",
    "refs.@xcite argued that the tracker solution can not be a viable one , since its existence requires @xmath161 .",
    "therefore we focused on the tachyon dominated solution .",

    "because of the existence of stable node(attractor ) , we found when @xmath162 , it s possible to have a trajectory in which the universe evolves naturally from radiation dominated regime to matter dominated regime , and then into the current dark energy dominated regime through qualitative discussion .",
    "the negative and positive branches , which respectively start from close to @xmath163 and @xmath164 , can be interpreted into different cosmological evolutions and it is possible that we are just living in a transitory accelerating period , while the final stage of universe will be identical for the same @xmath165 or @xmath166 . however",
    ", this perspective to see tachyon field as a combination of two parts revives the need of fine tuning .",
