    "cavity polaritons have attracted the attention of scientists since their discovery over twenty years ago  @xcite for their unique properties as quasi - particles , e.g. , extremely small , but nonzero effective mass , interactions , integer spin making them bosons , etc .",
    "@xcite this led to a number of outstanding fundamental phenomena : bose  einstein condensation ( bec ) , superfluidity , josephson oscillations and many others remarkable properties have been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "one of the key features of polaritons is their nonlinear optical properties , which opens to them the physics of interacting systems , such as optical parametric oscillations  @xcite , bi- and multistability effects  @xcite , numerous topological defects  @xcite , solitonic physics  @xcite , etc .",
    "also , boson - boson interaction have an important role in defining the bec properties . unlike atoms which have in general attractive interactions , which may result in a collapse of the bec  @xcite",
    ", polaritons have repulsive interactions  @xcite . weak attraction can occur between cross - polarized polaritons  @xcite , but this is in addition to the dominant co - polarized repulsion .",
    "it is increasingly appreciated that the polariton gas features one additional strong departure from its atomic counterpart , which is the presence of an exciton reservoir , i.e. , particles uncoupled to light that lie at higher energies and higher  @xmath0 vectors , and which provide a supply of particles for the short - lived polaritons at the bottom of their dispersion .",
    "the reservoir can extend considerably the lifetime of a polariton experiment  @xcite and even manifests directly  @xcite . as a rule",
    ", it strongly renormalizes the interaction strength , leading to a blueshift of the polariton emission  @xcite .",
    "the exciton reservoir arises not only when it is created by direct incoherent excitation , but can also be formed from resonant ground state excitation  @xcite .",
    "several experiments have reported a peculiar dynamics of the polaritons , such as a collapse of the polariton wavepacket  @xcite or a negative circular polarization of the condensate  @xcite .",
    "such effects could be understood with an effective attractive interaction  @xcite , but its exact nature is still unknown .    in this paper , we provide a mechanism to bring - in an attractive effective interaction for the polaritons , that is dominant over the other types of interactions .",
    "the core idea is to rely on high-@xmath0 excitons which indeed attract the ground state polaritons through their excitonic component .",
    "this should open new directions both to study the fundamental physics of these strongly correlated gas , but also for applications since , thanks to their extremely long lifetime and heaviness , high  @xmath0 excitons can provide engineerable potentials for polaritons , which is one of the prerequisites to use them in logical gates  @xcite .",
    "it seems that at the moment there is no way to imprint a dynamical negative potential ( potential wells ) of arbitrary shape .",
    "for instance , due to the repulsive polariton - polariton interactions , optical barriers can provide only positive potential ( potential walls ) .",
    "creation of negative potentials from the attractive interaction between cross - polarized particles has a lot of restrictions as well , due to the instability of the polarization and of the weakness of such an interaction .",
    "acoustic waves  @xcite brought up considerable tuning but do not allow for structures of arbitrary shapes . by using the long - lived exciton reservoir to create the potential structures , on the other hand",
    ", one can imprint virtually any shape from the excitation spot .",
    "as one example , we will show here how an attractive exciton reservoir can lead to ghz self - oscillations in the emission intensity  @xcite , adding another pulsed emitter in this regime of operation to the few known to date , e.g. , with silicon photonic crystal nanocavities  @xcite .",
    "polaritons are composed from photons and excitons and contributions from both fractions should be considered to describe polariton - polariton interaction .",
    "however , the main contribution to the energy shift induced by polariton - polariton interaction has been shown experimentally to be brought by their exciton component  @xcite .",
    "theoretical works predict an additional term for the scattering rates due to the exciton oscillator strength saturation that comes from the photonic component  @xcite , that is however small in comparison . it has also been shown that interactions coming from the direct polariton - polariton scattering is of a repulsive nature , while indirect scattering processes can be attractive , but again of a smaller magnitude .",
    "indeed , all such scattering processes , except weak van - der - waals scatterings , are for polaritons with opposite polarization .",
    "the strength of such interactions depends strongly on the detuning between the exciton and photon  @xcite , and , in best case , does not exceed the strength of the first order repulsive interaction . for this reason",
    ", we will focus on the direct exciton - exciton interaction .",
    "the theory was developed by ciuti  _ et al .",
    "_ , where the exciton - exciton scattering was separated into three types of processes : the direct coulomb repulsion , the exciton exchange interaction and the carrier ( electron and hole ) exchange interaction  @xcite .",
    "considering two excitons with wavevectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath3 , scattering each in the reciprocal space by the amount @xmath4 , the hamiltonian describing each of these interaction processes reads : @xmath5 where  @xmath6 label the type of interaction , @xmath7 is the angle between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the exciton bohr radius and  @xmath11 some overlap integrals - the only part which varies with the type of interaction . for direct and exciton exchange interactions , these integrals admit an analytical solution according to ref .",

    "one is that the integral of the direct coulomb scattering does not depend on the difference in the excitons wavevectors @xmath8 , but on the scattered wave vector @xmath22 only .",
    "moreover , it vanishes at zero @xmath22 , so the direct interaction has no influence on the states energy renormalization .",
    "the integral of the exciton exchange interaction @xmath23 has also a certain symmetry with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath22 , namely , @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the magnitude of the three integrals as a function of the momentum difference @xmath24 ( interrupted lines ) , and the total interaction ( thick line ) .     at which the character of the interaction reverses.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ] +    while the integral expressions @xmath11 have been known for over a decade and used in a large body of works  @xcite , the focus has been to the best of our knowledge exclusively on the transmitted wavevector  @xmath9 and for zero or small exchanged wavevector  @xmath24 , since it is typically much less than the inverse bohr radius of the exciton .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the interaction is usually considered equal and repulsive for all polaritons . however , as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , when @xmath26 , the interaction changes its sign and becomes attractive . moreover , the magnitude of the attractive interaction for large exchanged wavevectors is of the same order as the magnitude of repulsion in the common case of small exchanged wavevectors .    for the usual value of a bohr radius in the range from to ,",
    "the interaction is attractive for wavevectors difference of @xmath27 . to provide an attractive interaction between ground - state polaritons and high - energy excitons in gaas structures",
    ", this value of @xmath24 brings the exciton reservoir nearby the frontier of the light - cone , and in common cases it lies outside of it .",
    "this means that these excitons are not coupled with light , which can be advantageous to retain them for longer times in their role of an effective reservoir , but also impedes their introduction in the system straightforwardly in an optical way .",
    "we therefore propose to use the polariton - polariton scattering in order to create the high-@xmath0 excitons , namely , to scatter off the upper polaritons branch ( upb ) with no momentum to the lower branch , with conservation of the energy .",
    "similar processes have already been demonstrated  @xcite . to estimate the magnitude of attraction that can thus be obtained ,",
    "let us consider an ordinary cavity with a rabi splitting of at zero detuning .",
    "for a typical gaas exciton mass of @xmath28 and an exciton bohr radius @xmath29 , the wavevector of the final state is @xmath30 .",
    "this corresponds to the value @xmath31 , i.e. , the interaction between excitons and polaritons will be well into the attractive regime . to quantify the interaction strength to scatter polaritons from the bottom of upb to high-@xmath0 excitons , one should also calculate eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] but now taking @xmath32 . in this case @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so only two integrals have to be calculated .",
    "also , since we are interested in the scattering into attractive states , we can assume @xmath35 .",
    "the result is presented on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . scattering matrix element decreases significantly as scattered wavevector increases .",
    "still , in the region of reciprocal space we are interested in , @xmath36 . in other words ,",
    "the strength of scattering of two polaritons has the same order as the strength of exciton - polariton interaction .",
    "+    to describe in more details the mechanism of the reservoir formation under this scheme , we consider the dynamic of relaxation of the upper branch polaritons at  @xmath37 into reservoir excitons at  @xmath38",
    ". we must also include the thermal relaxation of these excitons to lower energy states , and therefore introduce a population `` @xmath39 '' of cold excitons .",
    "a set of semi - classical boltzmann equations written for the second- and first - order scattering processes  @xcite provide the equation of motion for their populations :    @xmath40    we have included @xmath41 the polariton ( exciton ) inverse lifetime , @xmath42 are the scattering rates between @xmath43 and @xmath0 states , and @xmath44 is the pumping rate of the upb . since the reservoir excitons lie outside of the light cone , we consider that their lifetime is limited only by their scattering rate  @xmath45 to cold states",
    ". finally , taking into account that @xmath46 , the set of equations is reduced to :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is the total scattering rate from the reservoir to cold excitons ( from initial state to the reservoir ) , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the total densities of polaritons , reservoir and cold excitons respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath48 is important since it constrains the attractive reservoir lifetime . from acoustic relaxation only , the effective time @xmath53 takes values from tens of picoseconds to nanoseconds depending on the 2d exciton bohr radius and the width of the quantum well  @xcite .    for excitons with a small bohr radius , e.g. , in gaas , although this time , which is tens of picoseconds , is short relatively to the cold exciton radiative lifetime @xmath54 , it remains long with respect to the polariton lifetime @xmath55 , so an attractive reservoir could be obtained for some finite duration of time , e.g. , in pulsed excitation experiments .",
    "such conditions occur , for example , in recent experimental work showing the collapse of the wavepacket  @xcite . for excitons with a large bohr radius , @xmath56 and",
    "the attractive potential can be sustained in the cw regime .",
    "the total density of excitons in the reservoir is easily obtained from the steady - state of the boltzmann equations  ( [ scbesimp ] ) : @xmath57 while for the population of cold excitons : @xmath58 with @xmath59 the steady - state value of the polariton density : @xmath60    since @xmath49 has the same order of magnitude as the strength of polariton - polariton interaction ( it is possible to get the product @xmath61 up to scale ) , and the reservoir exciton lifetime is very long ( @xmath62 ) , one can easily obtain the ratio @xmath63 .",
    "also , if @xmath64 , we can obtain @xmath65 , which means that the attractive forces acting on the ground - state polaritons will prevail .",
    "equations  [ scbesimp ] can now be extended to describe the coherent dynamics of the polaritons .",
    "we write a set of nonlinear schrdinger equations for the wavefunction of the upper polaritons ( @xmath66 ) coupled to the attractive exciton reservoir ( @xmath67 ) , which , in turn , are coupled to the gas of repulsive cold excitons ( @xmath68 ) :    @xmath69{\\psi _ { 0}}(\\mathbf{r},t ) + p(\\mathbf{r},t)}\\,,\\\\    \\frac{{d{n_r}(\\mathbf{r},t)}}{{dt } } = [ - \\frac{{{\\hbar}}}{{2{m_r}}}\\delta   - { w_{rcx}}]{n_r}(\\mathbf{r},t ) + { p_r}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\,,\\\\    \\frac{{d{n_{cx}}(\\mathbf{r},t)}}{{dt } } =   - { \\gamma _ { cx}}{n_{cx}}(\\mathbf{r},t ) + { w_{rcx}}{n_r}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\ , .",

    "however , @xmath70 can only be changed quantitavely , i.e. , its absolute value can change but not its sign .",
    "the reduction of  @xmath70 enhances the attraction from the reservoir , so we will consider the worst case , when @xmath70 is defined only by repulsive interactions . in this case",

    "the scattering rate @xmath49 is of the same order as @xmath71 .",
    "the term @xmath79 , that is responsible for the polariton creation , describes the resonant optical injection and is fixed externally by the experimentalist .",
    "we assumed a gaussian in space for the simulation .",
    "the term @xmath80 describes the exciton creation and is defined self - consistently by the equation of motion .",
    "its amplitude is proportional to @xmath81 , modulated by the fourier transform of an ellipse in the reciprocal space , as long as excitons are created in excited states .",
    "excitons have a slow motion as compared to the polaritons , due to their heaviness , and in eqs .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) of the main text , we neglect indeed the motion of the cold excitons .",
    "however , the group velocity of hot excitons in the region of interest in the reciprocal space ( @xmath82 ) is about per , which remains slow at the scale of the polariton lifetime but should be considered at the timescales over which the reservoir is expected to hold .",
    "therefore , we do not neglect the motion of the reservoir excitons in our calculation .",
    "however , the numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) in this form , i.e. , with a laplacian for the diffusion , is costly in time . to facilitate the computation , we approximate the reservoir exciton motion as ballistic , i.e.",
    ", we solve : @xmath83    in other words , we approximate the exciton dispersion by a linear function , whose slope is tangent to the actual parabolic dispersion at high wavevectors . in this way , we can shift the excitons momentum to the origin of the reciprocal space without changing their motion .",
    "this approximation only neglects the diffusion of excitons , which , however , can be neglected just like the motion of the cold excitons . also , for simplicity we neglect all the possible nonlinear terms in the equation for the exciton motion .",
    "we can now solve eqs .",
    "( [ nlse ] ) numerically .",
    "we consider a cw coherent resonant excitation at the bottom of the upb with a gaussian spatial profile in planar geometry . we take the following parameters : @xmath84 , @xmath85 , corresponding to an exciton of bohr radius , and an excitation spot of @xmath86 .",
    "the time evolution of the polariton intensity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  a. here we have considered the upper polariton branch only , while dealing with the lower branch is more convenient and popular in the laboratory due to the fast dephasing time of the upb in most of currently available samples .",

    "this represent a significant improvement on the recent experimental reports of oscillating emission from a polariton condensate  @xcite , since in our case the oscillation does not relax towards an equilibrium or decays with the condensate , but is sustained forever by the external continuous pumping , representing therefore a stronger case of self - oscillations .",
    "this behavior can be easily understood .",
    "polaritons introduced in the cavity are partially converted to reservoir excitons , and the competition between the polariton - polariton repulsion and the exciton - polariton attraction triggers a self - oscillation  @xcite .",
    "when the excitation intensity is strong enough , the attractive interaction prevails , creating a potential dip in the center .",
    "polaritons from the edges of the spot start to flow towards the exciton reservoir , increasing the number of polaritons in the center , and , therefore , also increasing the rate of polariton - exciton conversion .",
    "the effect becomes avalanche - like , the polariton wavepacket collapses and the number of excitons in the reservoir increases abruptly , providing a strong redshift for the polariton mode ( up to in our calculations ) .",
    "the energy shift of the ground state makes the optical injection of polaritons inefficient , resulting in a strong diminution of the polariton intensity .",
    "the redshift is kept up to until the reservoir excitons flow away ( their dynamics is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) , and the whole dynamics is repeated . the relaxation of reservoir excitons is slow as compared to their flow velocity , and a bunch of repulsive excitons , as well as the repulsive potential that they cause , are created outside of the excitation spot , not affecting the polariton dynamics in its center .",
    "the transition of the system from a normal behavior with constant emission intensity to the oscillating regime occurs when the excitation intensity crosses a threshold @xmath88 , which could be roughly estimated from eqs .",
    "( [ scbe][nrsteady ] ) .",
    "the transition between the two regimes occurs when the inward flow compensates the outwards flow , thus establishing a steady - state in the center of the spot .",
