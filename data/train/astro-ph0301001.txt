    "until recently , the _ new luyten two - tenths _ ( nltt ) catalog @xcite was the only all - sky catalog of high proper - motion stars extending to faint magnitudes . since its completion more than two decades ago , after a lifetime of work by luyten , the nltt has served as an invaluable source of candidate subdwarfs , white dwarfs , and nearby stars , as well as the basis for statistical studies of galactic populations",
    ".    however , the nltt does suffer from several significant shortcomings .",
    "first , while most nltt positions are accurate to the nominal catalog precision of ( @xmath10 ) , there is a tail of errors extending out to several arcmin and beyond @xcite .",
    "this means that a significant fraction of nltt stars can not easily be located .",
    "second , the photographic magnitudes ( and especially colors ) given by nltt are not precise enough to reliably classify stars using a reduced proper motion ( rpm ) diagram @xcite .",
    "third , nltt is seriously incomplete at faint magnitudes both close to the galactic plane and in the areas south of the first palomar observatory sky survey ( @xmath11 ) , especially @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , its completeness over the rest of the sky is not definitively known .",
    "since these shortcomings significantly limit nltt s application to various problems , substantial efforts have been made to rectify them .",
    "for example , @xcite cross identified nltt stars with 2mass @xcite entries , while @xcite directly identified stars from the _ luyten half - second _ ( lhs ) catalog @xcite on the digitized sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "lhs is a subset of nltt containing essentially all nltt stars with proper motions @xmath13 as well as some slightly slower than this limit .",
    "the nominal threshold for nltt is @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite cross identified nltt bright stars with three modern position and proper motion ( ppm ) catalogs , hipparcos @xcite ,",
    "tycho-2 @xcite , and starnet @xcite , while @xcite cross identified nltt faint stars with counterparts from usno - a @xcite and 2mass . together these comprise the revised nltt catalog ( rnltt ) . to the extent that one can find 2mass counterparts of nltt stars ,",
    "they can be placed on an optical / infrared color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , which allows much more secure rpm classification @xcite .",
    "finally , several groups have worked to estimate the completeness of nltt or , in some cases , improve it .",
    "@xcite made an independent search for stars exceeding nltt s proper - motion threshold over a single high - latitude schmidt plate .",
    "@xcite searched for high proper - motion ( @xmath15 ) stars to faint magnitudes toward 1378 deg@xmath16 .",
    "@xcite directly measured the completeness of bright ( @xmath17 ) stars by cross - identifying tycho-2 and hipparcos stars . @xcite",
    "estimated nltt completeness based on its internal properties , while i made a parameterized measurement of nltt completeness as a function of magnitude as a byproduct of my measurement of the properties of halo stars @xcite . in the appendix to that paper , i argued that all the available evidence is consistent with the following picture .",
    "nltt is virtually 100% complete for @xmath17 except near the plane where it falls to 75% . at fainter magnitudes",
    "( and away from the plane ) , completeness falls gradually to @xmath18 at @xmath19 . even at these faint magnitudes ,",
    "completeness is much higher for the small subset of high proper - motion stars , @xmath13 . to rectify the relatively high incompleteness levels toward the plane ,",
    "@xcite have undertaken a new intensive proper - motion search in this region .    with the publication of the long - awaited usno - b1.0 @xcite ,",
    "the prospects for improving , or perhaps superseding the nltt have taken a sharp turn for the better .",
    "usno - b1.0 is an all - sky ppm catalog based on deep photographic plates taken over about four decades in the north @xmath20 and two decades in the south .",
    "it contains @xmath21 entries , which not only specify the adopted ppm ( and errors ) , but also the astrometric and photometric measurements at all the epochs that were combined to make these determinations .",
    "however , although usno - b1.0 is a monumental undertaking , it can not be used immediately to assemble a catalog of high proper - motion stars . by deliberate construction",
    ", usno - b1.0 contains entries for _ all _ sets of detections within @xmath6 that can reasonably be matched to a straight - line motion over time ( and which have not previously been matched at higher confidence to other such linear ensembles of detections ) .",
    "these identifications were effected without making use of any additional information , such as photometry .",
    "this means that usno - b1.0 inevitably contains a large number of false high proper - motion entries . at high latitude",
    ", it contains about 200 times more entries than nltt , meaning that @xmath22 of these entries are spurious , formed of incorrect matching of unassociated stars or even of plate artifacts .",
    "as @xcite emphasize , this contamination is deliberate .",
    "the catalog s compilers sought to allow its users to sift through all possible associations to find the most possible genuine high proper - motion stars .",
    "i will discuss several ideas for how to go about doing this in   [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "however , before any of these are actually implemented ( or even precisely defined ) it is essential to understand the properties of the catalog itself , most importantly its completeness .    in this paper ,",
    "i study the completeness of usno - b by comparing it to the revised nltt ( rnltt ) as compiled by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "i perform two complementary comparisons , one to rnltt binaries and one to single stars .",
    "binaries in rnltt are extremely well understood because the supplementary notes to nltt give information on the separation and the position angle of the components .",
    "these permit an extra check on the reality of the rnltt identifications .",
    "binaries also constitute a subset of nltt that is of interest in its own right .",
    "hence , if nltt is eventually extended using usno - b , it will be important to understand usno - b s completeness as a function of binary separation .",
    "i will show that this completeness is indeed a strong function of separation .",
    "given this fact , binaries may seem a poor proxy for the single stars that constitute the vast majority of nltt entries .",
    "i handle this problem in two ways .",
    "first , i examine the binaries themselves at very wide separation where usno - b is unlikely to be affected by confusion caused by companions .",
    "second , i examine single stars from rnltt directly . because they are much more numerous , single stars also permit study of completeness as functions of apparent magnitude , proper motion , and galactic latitude .",
    "single stars do have the drawback that their identifications in rnltt are not quite as secure as are those of binaries , and this fact ultimately circumscribes the conclusions that can be drawn from studying them . nevertheless , the implications of the two comparisons are broadly consistent , and thus each lends credence to the other .",
    "in   [ sec : rnltt ] , i briefly review the properties of the rnltt . in   [ sec : bin ] and   [ sec : sing ] , i analyze the completeness of usno - b relative to , respectively , binary and single - star samples from rnltt . in ",
    "[ sec : errors ] , i determine the accuracies of the usno - b proper - motion measurements and compare these to its internal error estimates .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : discuss ] , i discuss the prospects for combining usno - b with other catalogs to obtain a clean , relatively complete sample of high proper - motion stars .",
    "the construction of the rnltt was a huge undertaking , which is laboriously documented in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "i review the basic features of this catalog as they affect the current paper .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , bright @xmath23 nltt stars are matched to bright ppm catalogs and faint nltt stars are ( mostly ) matched to pairs of stars from usno - a and the 2mass second incremental data release .",
    "bright stars will not be a major concern here because usno - b does not independently locate bright stars .",
    "rather , it simply incorporates tycho-2 entries directly into the catalog .",
    "hence , rnltt and usno - b typically have the same bright - star entries since they both come from the same source .",
    "bright stars are of interest only when they are components of common proper motion ( cpm ) binaries . in this case , the bright star is used solely to help establish the reality of the identification of its faint companion .",
    "while the great majority of faint stars are identified as usno - a/2mass pairs , some are found through several other channels .",
    "first , if no plausible pair is found within @xmath24 of the position given by nltt , but a 2mass star is found within @xmath25 of the position predicted by nltt , then it is accepted as a match ( provided it does not have a usno - a counterpart at the same position , which would indicate that it is not a high proper - motion star ) .",
    "the theory is that the nltt star is missing from usno - a , which can happen due to crowding , faintness , non - detection on blue plates , or other reasons that are not discernible .",
    "second , if there is a unique usno - a star within a @xmath26 rectangle of the nltt position but no corresponding 2mass star , then it also is accepted . in this case",
    "it is assumed that the star is missing from 2mass .",
    "third , if a star is located either in a ppm catalog or as a usno - a/2mass pair , but its binary companion is not , then the 2mass catalog is searched at the relative offset predicted by the nltt notes on binaries .",
    "companions within a few arcsec of the predicted position are accepted , provided they do not have usno - a counterparts ( which again would indicate that they are not high proper - motion stars ) .",
    "finally , a small number of stars are identified by other means , for example by confirming identifications of @xcite using 2mass .    at this point rnltt",
    "does not cover the whole sky .",
    "for faint stars , it is restricted to the 44% of the sky covered by intersection of the the first palomar observatory sky survey ( poss i ) , roughly @xmath27 , and the 2mass second incremental release . from the standpoint of doing statistical studies ,",
    "this is not a significant limitation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but it does need to be kept in mind .    the rnltt is about 97% complete relative to nltt up to @xmath28 ( roughly @xmath19 ) , and is 95% complete one magnitude fainter .",
    "however , in this last magnitude , the completeness is heavily dependent on single - catalog detections , which are less secure , while at brighter mags the overwhelming majority of entries are detected in both usno - a and 2mass ( see figure 13 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is important because , while the overall false identification rate in rnltt is only 1% , these errors are probably concentrated in the single - catalog identifications .",
    "the proper - motion errors in rnltt are about @xmath29 , but this excludes the @xmath30 outliers ( about 5% ) . however , in the present context it is important to note that very few of these outliers lie beyond @xmath31 ( see figure 10 of @xcite ) . while these errors are based on relatively bright ( @xmath32 ) usno - a/2mass detections , a separate test on cpm binaries ( but not reported by @xcite ) shows that the errors do not evolve strongly with magnitude .",
    "the epoch 2000 positions ( and hence the position errors ) come basically from 2mass .",
    "these are typically 130 mas , but do deteriorate for the faintest stars @xmath33 to about 300 mas or so . this will be important when trying to evaluate the completeness of usno - b in this faintest bin .    finally , i review the characteristics of rnltt binaries .",
    "the ( narrow - angle ) proper - motion errors for these are only @xmath34 .",
    "the vector separations given by the nltt notes are generally accurate to @xmath35 ( see figure 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "this permits an additional check on all stars that are members of binaries .",
    "when the two components are found separately they must have the offset predicted by the nltt notes .",
    "there are few enough candidate identifications that do not that satisfy this condition that these can be individually checked to insure that they are correct . for companions that are not identified independently ,",
    "the precise prediction for each one s position allows identification with good confidence ( and additional checks for the handful of suspicious cases ) .",
    "thus , the 2mass - only binary detections can be accepted with much higher confidence than is the case for single stars .",
    "to determine usno - b completeness , i consider a restricted set of rnltt binaries .",
    "first , i examine only binaries for which both components are detected and for which these components are separated by at least @xmath36 .",
    "closer binaries can be blended in usno - a , which leads to unreliable proper - motion measurements .",
    "second , i exclude components of wider binaries that are themselves members of closer binaries .",
    "this includes both triple systems recognized by nltt as well as nltt `` single stars '' that are resolved by the tycho double star catalog ( tdsc , @xcite ) .",
    "fourth , i exclude all binaries for which both components have ppm identifications .",
    "as mentioned above , usno - b generally takes over the tycho-2 proper motion for these stars , so they contain no information on usno - b completeness .",
    "next , i exclude all binaries for which one component has a usno - a - only identification because the additional checks discussed at the end of   [ sec : rnltt ] are not available for these stars .",
    "this leaves 549 pairs , of which 85 have at least one component that is detected in 2mass only .",
    "i put these latter aside for the moment and return to them later .",
    "hence , 464 pairs remain .    to match these stars , i first search within @xmath37 of their predicted position in usno - b .",
    "there are only 12 multiple matches and these are easily resolved by hand . for the nonmatches , i increase the search radius to @xmath38 , which leads to 13 additional matches , all but one within @xmath39 . of the 464 pairs ,",
    "378 have usno - b identifications for both components .",
    "figure [ fig : pmdif ] shows the difference in the proper motion of the two components of the 378 binaries as measured by usno - b and rnltt . of course to make this figure ,",
    "i have included only binaries with independent detections of both components in each catalog .",
    "figure [ fig : pmdif ] has three notable features : a diagonal plume , a vertical plume , and a dense knot close to the origin .",
    "the diagonal plume consists of pairs that are not physical pairs and were misidentified as such by luyten .",
    "both rnltt and usno - b agree on this verdict .",
    "the vertical plume consists of pairs that luyten correctly identified as physical ( or at any rate correctly identified as having very similar proper motions ) as confirmed by rnltt .",
    "the fact that usno - b finds large proper - motion differences between the components indicates that one or both measurements are erroneous .",
    "note that there is no similar horizontal plume , which would consist of real cpm binaries that were confirmed as such by usno - b but mismeasured by rnltt . finally , the dense knot consists of binaries that are confirmed by usno - b and rnltt to be physical .",
    "the inset shows that , while some of this relative motion may be real orbital motion , most of the scatter is uncorrelated between usno - b and rnltt and so is probably due to measurement error . the bold curve shows the contour to the left of which i conclude that one of the usno - b measurements is in error .",
    "after inspection of these , i find that in one case , both are in error .",
    "there are three points that do not lie within this contour , nor in the dense knot , nor in the diagonal plume . in the following",
    ", i will assume that these are accurate measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : sep1 ] shows the individual components of the 464 binaries analyzed above ( i.e. , all pairs for which both components have independent rnltt proper - motion measurements but excluding pairs for which both components were detected in ppm catalogs ) .",
    "these 464 pairs contain a total of 158 ppm stars , so the figure shows @xmath40 stars .",
    "of these , 33 ( shown by solid circles with error bars ) are erroneously measured components from the pairs lying inside the contour in figure [ fig : pmdif ] .",
    "the error bars indicate the proper - motion difference ( i.e. , the ordinate from fig .",
    "[ fig : pmdif ] ) in units of @xmath41 from usno - b measurements .",
    "the solid circles without error bars represent the 96 stars that were not detected in usno - b .",
    "when a star was detected in usno - b but its companion was one of the 96 that were not , i checked its proper motion against rnltt .",
    "the seven cases for which the difference exceeded @xmath42 are shown by a star .",
    "the remaining 639 stars , which are deemed good proper - motion measurements , are shown by small dots .",
    "the @xmath43 magnitudes and @xmath44 separations are taken from rnltt .",
    "figure [ fig : sep1 ] has two striking features . first , the `` problem stars '' ( poor measurements and non - matches ) are concentrated at separations @xmath45 .",
    "second , in the region @xmath46 , they are concentrated at bright magnitudes @xmath47 . hence , one may already conjecture that these problems are due to three effects , crowding ( at very close separations ) , confusion ( at moderate separations ) and saturation at bright magnitudes .    to obtain a more complete picture ,",
    "it is necessary to include the 2mass - only detections from rnltt .",
    "there are 85 such binaries of which 39 have one component identified from ppm catalogs . hence , there are an additional @xmath48 stars for which usno - b completeness and accuracy can in principle be tested .",
    "of these , 59 are missing from usno - b .",
    "when the remaining matches agree between usno - b and rnltt , i conclude that the usno - b measurement is correct .",
    "there is a serious disagreement in only one case . by comparing the separations as listed in the nltt notes and rnltt",
    ", i find that the usno - b proper motion is incorrect .",
    "in all the cases for which components are missing from usno - b , comparison of the nltt and rnltt separations confirms that the proper motions of the two stars is similar enough that the 2mass - only companion should have been recovered in usno - b ( if it had been there ) .    figure [ fig : sep2 ]",
    "shows the components of these rnltt binaries that were ( solid circles ) and were not ( points ) detected by usno - b . the one usno - b detection with a bad proper motion is indicated with an error bar .",
    "both the underlying rnltt sample and the usno - b non - detections are heavily concentrated at small separations and faint magnitudes .",
    "this is reasonable .",
    "most stars that are missing from usno - a are either too crowded or too faint to be reliably detected . proximity to a companion is one possible cause of crowding",
    ". these same features would make them difficult to detect in usno - b ( which is working off of the same and similar plate material ) .",
    "however , occasionally stars are missing from usno - a for no discernible reason .",
    "if these stars were also preferentially missing from usno - b , then one would expect a high relative density of solid circles among the relatively faint @xmath49 , well - separated ( @xmath46 ) stars , which appear so reliably detected in figure [ fig : sep1 ] . that this is not",
    "the case will be important in the interpretation of the single - star results reported in ",
    "[ sec : sing ] .",
    "figure [ fig : cumsep ] shows the cumulative distribution of `` problem stars '' ( relative to all stars ) as a function of binary separation .",
    "problem stars are defined as those that were not detected in usno - b , or whose proper motions are significantly in error ( solid circles and stars in figs.[fig : sep1 ] and [ fig : sep2 ] ) .",
    "this cumulative distribution is restricted to stars @xmath50 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "the problem rate is @xmath52 , while for @xmath53 , the rate is @xmath54 and for @xmath55 , it is @xmath56 .",
    "apparently , the detection problems increase substantially for @xmath45 , and do so much more dramatically for @xmath57 .",
    "these results are somewhat puzzling .",
    "while problems at @xmath58 are easy to understand , it is much more difficult to account for problems at @xmath59 . usno - b attempts to associate unmatched stars at displacements up to @xmath6 of their counterpart s position at a previous epoch .",
    "hence , a binary companion at @xmath6 ( which would of course be initially unmatched by the preliminary algorithm that matches nonmoving stars ) could easily cause confusion .",
    "stars at somewhat greater separation could still create problems if their proper motions moved them within @xmath6 .",
    "however , the problem stars have rather typical proper motions for nltt , with almost all having @xmath60 .",
    "such proper motions would carry them only @xmath61 ( and generally much less ) over typical 30-year epoch differences .",
    "one is therefore led to suspect some sort of selection effect in the procedure i have adopted .",
    "however , i am unable to think of any that could produce this effect .",
    "thus , on physical grounds , the problem rate should be roughly independent of separation for @xmath62 .",
    "the mean rate at these separations is @xmath63 .",
    "the number expected outside @xmath46 is then about 15 . hence , the 10 actually counted is low by only @xmath64 .",
    "the analysis of binaries therefore indicates that for separations too large to be affected by confusion and fainter than @xmath50 , the problem rate is about @xmath65 .",
    "inspection of figures [ fig : sep1 ] and [ fig : sep2 ] shows that about 2/3 of these problem stars are missing from usno - b , and most of the remainder have very significant errors , of order @xmath66 or larger .",
    "to find the incompleteness rate among single stars , i search for usno - b matches to rnltt stars whose proper motions are determined by finding counterparts in usno - a and 2mass .",
    "that is , all ppm detections , all usno - a - only and all 2mass - only detections are eliminated .",
    "i also eliminate all binaries and all stars that are regarded as single by nltt but are resolved in tdsc .",
    "these cuts define an rnltt sample of 20,798 stars . as summarized in ",
    "[ sec : rnltt ] , the proper motions for these stars are accurate to @xmath29 , with very few outliers beyond @xmath31 . the overall misidentification rate of the non - ppm stars in rnltt is about 1% , but is probably significantly lower for this subset because it excludes stars that were identified in only one catalog .",
    "the errors in the 2000-epoch positions are dominated by 2mass astrometry errors , and are therefore typically @xmath67 .",
    "i again begin by searching within a @xmath37 radius of rnltt stars , which yields 18,420 unique matches and 446 double matches and 1 triple match .",
    "for the multiple matches , i choose the better match by hand .",
    "i then search among the 1931 non - matches for usno - b entries lying within a @xmath38 circle .",
    "for this larger radius , i accept only those stars with proper motions within @xmath41 of rnltt or ( in 11 cases ) for which usno - b has a flag indicating a probable match with nltt .",
    "this procedure recovers a total of 130 matches , all unique .",
    "figure [ fig : badmag ] shows the fraction of problem stars as a function of @xmath43 apparent magnitude .",
    "the fraction that are `` bad '' or missing is denoted by a solid circle whose error bar is estimated from poisson ( actually binomial ) statistics .",
    "the fraction that are simply missing from usno - b is denoted by a cross . here",
    "`` bad '' means that the amplitude of the vector difference of the usno - b and rnltt proper motion exceeds @xmath31 and also exceeds twice the usno - b proper - motion errors .",
    "recall that very few rnltt stars have errors as large as @xmath31 @xcite . among those designated `` bad '' , 3/4 have proper - motion differences exceeding @xmath68 and 1/2 exceeding @xmath66 .",
    "the results presented in figure [ fig : badmag ] are broadly consistent with those discussed in   [ sec : bin ] but contain more detail .",
    "the fraction of usno - b stars that are either unmatched or have bad proper motions is consistently @xmath69 over the magnitude range @xmath70 .",
    "this is consistent , within statistical uncertainties , with the estimate @xmath65 from wide binaries .",
    "also in agreement with the binary analysis is the fact that about 2/3 of these problem stars are unmatched and the remaining 1/3 have large proper - motion errors .",
    "however , the much better statistics allow one to discern that the problems with bright stars actually extend beyond the @xmath71 boundary inferred from figure [ fig : sep1 ] to the @xmath72 bin . finally , there is a clear worsening in the final bin , @xmath73 , both for missing and large - error stars .",
    "one might be concerned that the rnltt errors themselves grow worse at these faint magnitudes which , if true , would artificially inflate the number of usno - b stars with apparently large errors",
    ". however , about 75% of the `` bad '' usno - b proper motions have discrepancies in excess of @xmath66 , and these offsets are unlikely to be due to rnltt errors .",
    "one may be concerned that the results shown in figure [ fig : badmag ] are biased because the rnltt sample does not include nltt stars that lacked counterparts in usno - a .",
    "if such non - identifications are correlated between usno - a and usno - b , then the resulting incompleteness estimates would be too low .",
    "in fact , this is a potential concern only for the last two bins , @xmath74 and @xmath73 . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the 2mass - only entries comprise less than 1% of rnltt stars , so the correction is much less than this value . for the final two bins , the 2mass - only entries comprise respectively 3% and 33% respectively . in each case , about 22% of these 2mass - only stars are missing , while about 50% are either missing or have discrepant proper motions .",
    "even if these designations were taken at face value , the fraction of problem stars in the @xmath74 bin would only rise from 10% to 11% , which is barely significant .",
    "by contrast the fraction of problem @xmath73 stars would rise from 18% to 30% .",
    "however , the characterization of the 2mass - only stars must be interpreted very cautiously .",
    "in contrast to the binary case , we have no independent confirmation that the 2mass - only identifications are real . and if they are , we have no assurance that the adopted nltt proper motions are correct . while @xcite showed that the total fraction of false identifications in rnltt is @xmath76 , these are very likely concentrated in the 2mass - only detections . since less than 3% of the rnltt sample has 2mass - only identifications , no strong conclusion can be drawn from the higher rate of usno - b `` incompleteness '' of these stars .",
    "in addition , for the case of binaries ( for which we do have independent checks on the reality of the identifications ) , there is no evidence for an especially high incompleteness rate for 2mass - only rnltt identifications at @xmath33 . in brief , the incompleteness estimates shown in figure  [ fig : badmag ] are probably not seriously affected by the exclusion of 2mass - only stars from the sample .",
    "figure [ fig : badpm ] show that usno - b incompleteness gradually rises toward higher proper motion .",
    "this is to be expected from the intrinsic difficulty of identifying high proper - motion stars on plates separated by one to several decades .",
    "it is somewhat exacerbated by the fact that usno - b does not attempt to find counterparts whose plate positions differ by more than @xmath6 at different epochs .",
    "hence , very high proper - motion stars can be lost simply because they have moved too far between epochs to be recovered .",
    "note that the fraction of bad proper motions actually shrinks toward high proper motions .",
    "that is , if the star is recovered at all , its proper - motion measurement is rarely seriously in error .",
    "figure [ fig : badlat ] shows usno - b incompleteness relative to rnltt as a function of ( the sine of ) galactic latitude .",
    "the sample is restricted to the magnitude range @xmath77 for which overall completeness is a maximum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : badmag ] ) . as would be expected ,",
    "incompleteness peaks sharply at the galactic plane .",
    "however , figure [ fig : badlat ] should be interpreted cautiously .",
    "nltt ( and so rnltt ) is seriously incomplete near the plane at these faint magnitudes , increasing to @xmath78 for @xmath79 within @xmath80 of the plane . ] .",
    "since it is not known precisely what distinguishes the very few stars found by luyten from the vast majority that he missed , one also does not know whether these are more or less likely to have been found by usno - b .",
    "for example , luyten s completeness was higher for lhs than nltt .",
    "see for example the comparison of the studies by @xcite and @xcite given in the appendix to @xcite . since usno - b is more incomplete for these higher proper - motion stars ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : badpm ] ) , this effect would tend to cause usno - b incompleteness to be overestimated . on the other hand",
    ", luyten may have preferentially recovered stars that were intrinsically easier to find , such as brighter stars .",
    "if usno - b also had an easier time recovering such stars , this would cause usno - b incompleteness to be underestimated .",
    "we can get some handle on the latter problem by considering the sample of 141 non - nltt stars satisfying @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , found by @xcite . in order to compare as directly as possible with the central two bins of figure [ fig : badlat ] ,",
    "i further restrict this sample to the 40 ( non - binary ) stars satisfying @xmath80 and @xmath85 .",
    "of these 20 have good usno - b matches and another 4 have matches with proper - motion discrepancies larger than @xmath31 .",
    "that is 40% are missing , and @xmath86 are either missing or bad .",
    "these numbers are somewhat higher than the two central bins of figure [ fig : badlat ] .",
    "however , given that usno - b incompleteness is already known to increase at these higher proper motions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : badpm ] ) , the results are roughly consistent .",
    "@xcite suggest that their survey may be 99% complete for @xmath87 based on its efficiency recovering nltt and lhs stars .",
    "if this were true , then the above analysis would imply that usno - b is about 60% complete even very close to the plane .",
    "however , @xcite also allow that nltt has preferentially found the easiest stars , so that no strong conclusion can be derived from the fact that their survey also recovered these .",
    "indeed , this is very likely the case , as one may verify by comparing figure 13 of @xcite with figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "the former shows that the nltt `` luminosity function '' for the whole sky begins falling only for @xmath88 , while the latter shows that the luminosity function of @xcite stars begins falling for @xmath89 .",
    "thus , at the present time , it is simply not possible to draw strong conclusions about the completeness of usno - b for faint stars close to the galactic plane .",
    "figure [ fig : pmdif2 ] shows the magnitudes of the vector differences of three different proper - motion measurements : the abscissa is the difference between rnltt and nltt while the ordinate is the difference between rnltt and usno - b .",
    "the figure has three prominent features : a dense horizontal plume along the @xmath90-axis extending out to @xmath91 , a much less dense vertical plume centered at @xmath92 , and a still less dense vertical plume centered at @xmath93 .",
    "the first vertical plume extends down to the horizontal plume , but the second appears to cut off below @xmath94 .    the horizontal plume occurs because there is a tail of nltt proper - motion errors extending out to @xmath66 and beyond .",
    "usno - b confirms that the rnltt measurements are correct , which is what gives this plume its horizontal character .",
    "@xcite generally searched for 2mass counterparts to usno - a candidates only in a @xmath95 radius around the position predicted using the nltt proper motion . since the typical epoch difference between these surveys is @xmath96yr , the maximum proper - motion difference is @xmath97 , which accounts for the cutoff .",
    "the first vertical plume is due to large usno - b errors .",
    "the fact that the plume is centered at @xmath92 , which is the size of the ( two - dimensional ) nltt proper - motion errors @xcite , means that nltt confirms the rnltt measurements . about 37% of this plume",
    "is made up of bright @xmath98 stars , although these comprise only 22% of the whole sample .",
    "thus , large errors are overrepresented at bright magnitudes but extend to faint stars as well .",
    "this was already apparent from figure  [ fig : badmag ] .",
    "the second plume is due to false identifications in rnltt , i.e. pairs of unrelated usno - a and 2mass stars that happened to have approximately the vector separation predicted by the nltt proper motion .",
    "these tend to be found near the edge of the @xmath95 search circle ( which contains the most area ) .",
    "about half of these points have @xmath99 despite the fact that these faint stars comprise only 6% of the sample .",
    "such false identifications are most likely when the nltt star is absent from usno - a , and this occurs most frequently for faint stars .",
    "the plume appears to begin at @xmath100 because the 2mass star does not have a high proper - motion .",
    "hence , the ordinate is roughly equal to the rnltt proper motion whose scale is set by the proper - motion limit of nltt , @xmath101 .",
    "i determine the usno - b errors as a function of @xmath43 magnitude by calculating the rms difference between the rnltt and usno - b measured proper motions and subtracting ( in quadrature ) the rnltt errors , @xmath102 .",
    "the resulting external estimates per component of the usno - b errors are shown as open circles in figure  [ fig : pmerr ] .",
    "these estimates are derived by excluding @xmath30 outliers , which constitute roughly 5% of the sample for @xmath103 and 12% for the remaining three bins .",
    "these external errors may be compared with the rms internal errors shown as crosses , which are computed from the errors tabulated for the same stars in usno - b .",
    "the two sets of estimates are in good overall agreement , showing that both usno - b and rnltt errors are well - estimated on average .",
    "how good are the individual usno - b error bars ?",
    "figure  [ fig : intvsext ] shows external error estimates based on comparison with rnltt as a function of internally reported usno - b errors .",
    "again @xmath30 outliers have been excluded and the @xmath29 errors of rnltt have been subtracted in quadrature .",
    "the internal error estimates are accurate over the range 420 @xmath104 .",
    "there appears to be a threshold of @xmath105 .",
    "usno - b stars with listed error estimates below this level should be reset at the threshold . also , stars with reported errors larger than @xmath106 may have even larger errors .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , usno - b can not be consulted directly as a high proper - motion catalog because of the large number of spurious entries . here",
    "i briefly outline several approaches to using usno - b to construct such a catalog .",
    "first , usno - b can be used to check the identifications of nltt stars by rnltt .",
    "while the great majority of the stars in the first vertical plume of figure  [ fig : pmdif ] are usno - b errors , there must be an extension of the second plume toward the left , which is then buried in the first plume .",
    "the total number of usno - b / rnltt discrepancies is not so great that they can not be individually checked . indeed",
    "if this procedure is extended to the 2mass - only and usno - a - only identifications in rnltt , it will uncover a large fraction of the false identifications .",
    "second , usno - b can be used to extend rnltt to the rest of the sky . for faint stars ( @xmath107 )",
    "rnltt presently covers only the 44% of the sky defined by the intersection of the 2mass second incremental release and poss i. after the full 2mass release , it will be possible to apply the approach of @xcite to the rest of the poss i sky ( @xmath108 ) , but this process would be extremely laborious",
    ". it may be far simpler to simply match usno - b to 2mass .",
    "this would eliminate the great majority of spurious usno - b entries .",
    "the usno - b/2mass matches could then be paired to nltt stars using the strategy described in   3 of @xcite .",
    "moreover , this approach could equally well be applied to stars south of poss i where the method of @xcite fails because usno - a is missing most high proper - motion stars in this region .",
    "the problem of using usno - b to overcome nltt s incompleteness is more difficult .",
    "once usno - b is matched to 2mass , as described above , one will be able to determine the rate of spurious entries by comparing to nltt .",
    "it may then also be possible to recognize such spurious entries based on the internal characteristics of the matched entries .",
    "for example , discrepancies in the photographic magnitudes at various usno - b epochs , or inconsistencies between the optical and infrared colors could turn out to be efficient indicators of spurious entries .",
    "astrometric inconsistencies between usno - b and 2mass may also be useful indicators .",
    "analogs of both these approaches were used by @xcite when matching 2mass and usno - a .",
    "more difficult will be the problem of finding high - proper motion stars that are too faint and/or blue to be present in 2mass . for those stars in nltt",
    ", the above - mentioned approach of @xcite may work even without 2mass counterparts .",
    "high proper motion stars that were missed by nltt and are absent from 2mass as well will be most difficult . perhaps the most promising prospect is the semi - automatic procedure of @xcite .",
    "i thank samir salim for his careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "i thank d.  monet and the usno - b team for providing me with a copy of the usno - b1.0 catalog .",
