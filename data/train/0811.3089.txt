    "the study of event - by - event fluctuations in high energy nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions opens new possibilities to investigate the phase transition between hadronic and partonic matter as well as the qcd critical point ( cf .",
    "the reviews @xcite ) . by measuring the fluctuations one might observe anomalies from the onset of deconfinement  @xcite and dynamical instabilities when the expanding system goes through the 1-st order transition line between the quark - gluon plasma and the hadron gas @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the qcd critical point may be signaled by a characteristic pattern in the fluctuations as pointed out in ref .",
    "however only recently , due to a rapid development of experimental techniques , first measurements of the event - by - event fluctuations of particle multiplicities @xcite and transverse momenta @xcite in nucleus - nucleus collisions have been performed .    from the theoretical side such event - by - event fluctuations for charged hadron multiplicities ( in nucleus - nucleus collisions )",
    "have been studied in statistical models @xcite and in dynamical transport approaches @xcite , which have been used as important tools to investigate high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "we recall that the statistical models reproduce the mean multiplicities of the produced hadrons ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) , whereas the transport models ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) provide , in addition , a dynamical description of the various bulk properties of the system . by studying the various fluctuations within statistical and transport models we have found out that fluctuations provide an extremely sensitive observable - depending on the details of the models - which are partly washed out by looking at general quantities such as ensemble averages .",
    "in particular , there is a qualitative difference in the properties of the mean multiplicity and the scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution in statistical models . in the case of mean multiplicities the results obtained within the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , canonical ensemble ( ce ) , and micro - canonical ensemble ( mce ) approach each other in the large volume limit .",
    "one refers here to the thermodynamical equivalence of the statistical ensembles .",
    "however , it was recently found @xcite that corresponding results for the scaled variances are different in the gce , ce and mce ensembles , and thus the scaled variance is sensitive to global conservation laws obeyed by a statistical system .",
    "these differences are preserved in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "also there is a qualitative difference in the behavior of the scaled variances of multiplicity distributions in statistical and transport models .",
    "the transport models predict @xcite that the scaled variances in central nucleus - nucleus collisions remain close to the corresponding values in proton - proton collisions and increase with collision energy in the same way as the corresponding multiplicities , whereas in the statistical models the scaled variances approach finite values at high collision energy , i.e. become independent of energy .",
    "accordingly , the differences in the scaled variance of charged hadrons can be about factor of 10 at the top rhic energy @xcite .",
    "only upcoming experimental data can clarify the situation .",
    "the qgp stage may form a specific set of primordial fluctuation signals .",
    "a well known example is the equilibrium electric charge fluctuation in qgp which is about a factor 2 - 3 smaller than in an equilibrium hadron gas @xcite . to observe primordial qgp fluctuations",
    "they should be frozen out during expansion , hadronization , and further hadron - hadron re - scatterings .",
    "evolution and survival of the conserved charge fluctuations in systems formed in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the sps and rhic energies were discussed in refs .",
    "note that both the statistical models and the hsd approach used in our study do not include the quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the fluctuations in the qgp are outside of the scope of the present paper .",
    "the measurement of the fluctuations in the kaon to pion ratio by the na49 collaboration @xcite was the first event - by - event measurement in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "it was suggested that this ratio might allow to distinguish the enhanced strangeness production attributed to the qgp phase .",
    "nowadays , the excitation function for this observable is available in a wide range of energies : from the na49 collaboration in pb+pb collisions at the cern sps @xcite and from the star collaboration in au+au collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "first statistical model estimates of the @xmath0 fluctuations have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , and results from the transport model urqmd in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a systematic study of statistical model results ( in different ensembles ) in comparison to hsd transport model results for the fluctuations in the kaon to pion number ratio .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the characteristic definitions for fluctuations in particle number ratios are introduced . in section",
    "iii the relevant formulas of the statistical models ( in different ensembles ) are presented .",
    "statistical and hsd model results for the fluctuations in the kaon to pion ratio for central nucleus - nucleus collisions are compared in section iv . in section v the hsd transport model results are additionally confronted with the available data on @xmath0 fluctuations .",

    "( [ sigma ] ) may become especially important .",
    "a resonance decaying always into a @xmath27-pair does not contribute to @xmath23 ( [ sigma ] ) , but contributes to the @xmath28 and @xmath29 average multiplicities .",

    "set_. the construction of _ mixed events _ is done as follows : one fixes a random number @xmath39 according to the experimental probability distribution @xmath40 , takes randomly @xmath41 particles ( @xmath3 and/or @xmath5 ) from the _ whole set _ , fixes the values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and returns these @xmath41 particles into the _ set_. this is the mixed event number one .",
    "then one constructs event number 2 , number 3 , etc .",
    "note that the number of events is much larger than the number of hadrons , @xmath41 , in any single event .",

    "another consequence of a large number of events is the fact that @xmath3 and @xmath5 particles in any constructed _ mixed event _ belong to different _ physical events _ of nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "therefore , the correlations between the @xmath38 and @xmath37 numbers in a physical event are expected to be destroyed in a mixed event .",

    "the most important effect of an exact charge conservation in the ce ensemble is a suppression of the kaon number fluctuation .",

    "an important feature of the mce is the anticorrelation between @xmath63 and @xmath62 , i.e. negative values of @xmath149 .",
    "this is also a consequence of energy conservation for each microscopic state of the system in the mce @xcite .",
    "the presented results demonstrate that global conservation laws are rather important for the values of @xmath148 , @xmath147 , and @xmath149 .",

    "one may conclude that negative values of @xmath149 in hsd appear because of a dominant role of energy conservation in joint @xmath156-@xmath157 production at small collision energies .",
    "the hsd values of @xmath149 become , however , positive and strongly increases with increasing collision energy .",
    "this is due to the contribution of heavy strings to joint @xmath156-@xmath157 ( or @xmath164 ) production at high energies in the hsd simulations .",
    "note that the hsd results for @xmath148 , @xmath147 , and @xmath149 in nucleus - nucleus collisions become larger than those in proton - proton inelastic reactions at high collision energies .",
    "this is due to an increase of secondary ( i.e. meson - baryon and meson - meson ) collisions at higher bombarding energy .",
    "thus , a strong deviation of hsd from the sm with increasing energies is a consequence of non - equilibrium dynamics in the hadron - string model which is driven by the formation of heavy strings and their decay . indeed , future experimental data on the fluctuations of @xmath165 and @xmath166-correlations will allow to shed more light on the equilibration pattern achieved in heavy - ion collisions at rhic energies .",
    "two comments are appropriate here .",

    ", an essential part of the system energy is transformed to collective motion .",
    "thus , even in the sample of the hsd events with fixed number of participants , the thermal energy of the created particles can fluctuate from event to event .",
    "both the charge and energy fluctuations in hsd are not of thermal origin .",
    "therefore , an attempt to interpret the hsd multiplicity fluctuations in statistical terms would require to use a more general concept of statistical ensembles with fluctuating extensive quantities @xcite .",
    "in particular , large values of the scaled variances , @xmath169 , in high energy proton - proton collisions are also present in the hsd simulations of nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the sm model",
    "this would require a special form of scaling volume fluctuations as recently suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our second comment concerns the physical origin of the correlation parameter @xmath149 .",
    "two sources of the @xmath156-@xmath157 correlations are : resonance , string decays and electric charge conservation . to estimate their relative weights",

    "note that electric charge conservation leads also to qualitatively different correlation effects in @xmath170 and @xmath171 channels .",
    "the fluctuation in the kaon to pion ratio is dominated by the fluctuations of kaons alone since the average multiplicity of kaons is about 10 times smaller than that of pions .",

    "( [ sigmakpi ] ) gives the dominant contribution , while the 2-nd and 3-rd terms in ( [ sigmakpi ] ) give only small corrections .",

    "( [ sigmakpi ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ dmix ] )  are presented in the _ left _ and _ right _ panel , respectively , for the sm in different ensembles as well as for the hsd simulations . the first conclusion from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( _ left _ )",
    "is that all results for @xmath172 in the different models are rather similar .",
    "one observes a monotonic decrease of @xmath172 with collision energy .",
    "this is just because of an increase of the kaon and pion average multiplicities with collision energy .",
    "the mixed event fluctuations @xmath173 in the model analysis are fully defined by these average multiplicities according to eq .",
    "( [ dmix ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath173 are therefore the same in the different statistical ensembles .",
    "they are also very close to the hsd values because we have fixed the statistical system volume to obtain the same kaon average multiplicities in the statistical model as in hsd at each collision energy . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( _ right _ ) the requirement of @xmath178 leads to practically equal values of @xmath173 in both hsd and the sm .    differences between the statistical ensembles as well as between the statistical and hsd results become visible for other measures of @xmath0 fluctuations such as @xmath174 defined by eq .",
    "( [ sigmadyn ] ) and @xmath179 .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , _ left _ and _ right _ , respectively . at small collision energies",
    "the ce and mce results in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] demonstrate negative values of @xmath174 , respectively @xmath180 . when the collision energy increases , @xmath174 in the ce and mce ensembles becomes positive , i.e. @xmath181 . moreover , the different statistical ensembles approach to the same values of @xmath174 and @xmath34 at high collision energy . in the sm",
    "the values of @xmath172 and @xmath173 approach zero at high collision energies due to an increase of the average multiplicities .",
    "the same limit should be also valid for @xmath174 in the sm .",
    "in contrast , the measure @xmath34 shows a different behavior at high energies : the sm gives @xmath182 in the high energy limit , while the hsd result for @xmath34 demonstrates a monotonic increase with collision energy .",
    "an interesting feature of the sm is approximately the same result for @xmath172 ( and , thus , @xmath174 and @xmath34 ) in the ce and mce ensembles . from table i and figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] one observes that both @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 are rather different in the ce and mce .",
    "thus , as discussed above , an exact energy conservation influences the particle scaled variances and correlations .",
    "these changes are , however , cancelled out in the fluctuations of the kaon to pion ratio .",
    "it has been mentioned in the literature ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the particle number ratio is independent of volume fluctuations since both multiplicities are proportional to the volume . in fact , the _ average multiplicities _ @xmath175 and @xmath176 , but not @xmath62 and @xmath63 , are proportional to the system volume .",
    "let us consider the problem in the sm assuming the presence of volume fluctuations at fixed values of @xmath73 and @xmath137 .",
    "this assumption corresponds approximately to volume fluctuations in nucleus - nucleus collisions from different impact parameters in each collision event . under these assumptions",
    "the sm values in table i remain the same for any volume ( if only this volume is large enough and the finite size corrections can be neglected ) .",
    "however , the average hadron multiplicities are proportional to the volume .",
    "therefore , the sm result for @xmath23 reads , @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the average system volume , and @xmath185 is calculated for the average multiplicities corresponding to this average volume @xmath184 .",
    "expanding @xmath186 in powers of @xmath187 , one finds to second order in @xmath187 , @xmath188 ~ ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath189 corresponds to an average over the volume distribution function @xmath190 which describes the volume fluctuations . as clearly seen from eq .",
    "( [ v3 ] ) the volume fluctuations influence , of course , the @xmath0 particle number fluctuations and make them larger . comparing the @xmath0 particle number fluctuations in , e.g. , 1% of most central nucleus - nucleus collisions with those in , e.g. , 10% one should take into account two effects .",
    "first , in the 10% sample the average volume @xmath184 is smaller than that in 1% sample and , thus , @xmath191 in eq .",
    "( [ v3 ] ) is larger .",
    "second , the volume fluctuations ( [ v4 ] ) in the 10% sample is larger , and this gives an additional contribution to @xmath23 according to eq .  ( [ v3 ] ) .",
    "one may also consider volume fluctuations at fixed energy and conserved charges ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this case",
    "the connection between the average multiplicity and the volume becomes more complicated .",
    "the volume fluctuation within the mce ensemble can strongly affect the fluctuations in the particle number ratios .",
    "this possibility will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming study .",
    "a comparison of the sm results for @xmath0 fluctuations in different ensembles with the data looks problematic at present .",
    "this is because of difficulties with implementing the experimental acceptance in the sm ( see a discussion of this point in ref .",
    "a similar problems exist in the sm with chemical non - equilibrium effects discussed in ref .",
    "the experimental acceptance can be taken into account in the transport code . in order to compare the hsd calculations with the measured data the experimental cuts are applied for the simulated set of the hsd events . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the hsd results for the excitation function in @xmath174 ( [ sigmadyn ] ) for the @xmath0 ratio is shown in comparison with the experimental data measured by the na49 collaboration at the sps cern  @xcite and by the star collaboration at bnl rhic  @xcite .    for the sps energies we used a cut @xmath192  gev / c applied by na49 to provide a precise particle identification . for the rhic energies the cuts are in pseudorapidity , @xmath193 , and in the transverse momentum , @xmath194  gev / c ,  @xcite .",
    "we note also , that the hsd results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] correspond to the specific centrality selections as in the experiment - the na49 data correspond to the 3.5% most central collisions selected via the veto calorimeter , whereas in the star experiment the 5% most central events with the highest multiplicities in the pseudorapidity range @xmath195 have been selected .",
    "the hsd results - within the acceptance cuts - are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( _ left _ ) as solid lines .",
    "in addition in the l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the result for the full acceptance is indicated by a dotted line .",
    "one can see that the experimental cuts lead to a systematic increase of @xmath174 , however , do not change the shape of the excitation function . by comparing the full acceptance line to those in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( _ left _ ) for @xmath155 one sees also a small enhancement of @xmath174 which is due to slight decrease of the hadron multiplicities and , correspondingly , increase of those fluctuations .    in the",
    "_ right _ panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the hsd results for @xmath174 within the experimental acceptance are compared with two different versions of urqmd v1.3 simulations @xcite and the na49 data in the sps energy range . the remaining differences between the urqmd v1.3 calculations from 2006 and 2004 at 160 a gev can be attributed to the differences in implementation of acceptance cuts ( cf .",
    "discussion in ref .",
    "one sees that the urqmd model gives practically a constant @xmath174 , which is about @xmath196 smaller than the results from hsd at the lowest sps energy .",
    "this difference between the two transport models might be attributed to different realizations of the string and resonance dynamics in hsd and urqmd : in urqmd the strings decay first to heavy baryonic and mesonic resonances which only later on decay to ` light ' hadrons such as kaons and pions . in hsd",
    "the strings dominantly decay directly to ` light ' hadrons ( from the pseudoscalar meson octet ) or the vector mesons @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath164 ( or the baryon octet and decouplet in case of baryon number @xmath199 ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , @xmath174 is indeed very sensitive to the model details at low bombarding energies : the sm in different ensembles and the hsd give rather different behavior at the low sps energies ( cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] , _ left _ ) .",
    "while the urqmd results are available presently only up to the top sps energy , the hsd model shows a good agreement with the recent star data @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] , _ left _ ) . a good agreement with the star data @xcite for @xmath0 ratio fluctuations in cu+cu at @xmath200200  gev",
    "was also obtained in the multi - phase transport model ( ampt ) @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the corresponding result from the heavy - ion - jet - interaction generator ( hijing ) model @xcite which over - predicts substantially the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the difference has been attributed in ref .",
    "@xcite to an absence of the final re - scattering in hijing which is incorporated in ampt as well as in hsd .",
    "we have studied the event - by - event fluctuations of the kaon to pion number ratio in central au+au ( or pb+pb ) collisions from low sps up to top rhic energies within the statistical hadron - resonance gas model for different statistical ensembles  the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) , canonical ensemble ( ce ) , and micro - canonical ensemble ( mce )  and in the hadron - string - dynamics transport approach .",
    "we have obtained substantial differences in the hsd and statistical model results for the scaled variances @xmath147 , @xmath148 and the correlation parameter @xmath149 as presented in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "thus , the second moments of the multiplicity distributions may serve as a good probe for the amount of equilibration achieved in central nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "note that the differences between the transport and statistical model results for multiplicity fluctuations and correlations increase with collision energy ( see refs .",
    "there are also arguments that the behavior of higher moments of event - by - event multiplicities may serve as an important signature of the qcd critical point @xcite ) .",
    "the observable @xmath174 , which characterizes the fluctuations of the kaon to pion ratio , shows to be rather sensitive to the details of the model at low collision energies .",
    "the ce and mce results in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] demonstrate negative values for @xmath174 , while the gce gives approximately a constant positive value for @xmath174 .",
    "the hsd results correspond to larger values of @xmath174 than those in the gce statistical model .",
    "they even show an increase at lower sps energies .",
    "when the collision energy increases , the quantity @xmath174 in the ce and mce becomes positive .",
    "moreover , the different statistical ensembles approach to the same values of @xmath174 at high collision energy .",
    "this is just because the values of @xmath172 and @xmath173 approach zero at high collision energies .",
    "thus , the same limit equal to zero should be also valid for @xmath174 in the statistical models .",
    "on the other hand , the measure @xmath201 shows another behavior at high energies .",
    "the statistical models give a constant value @xmath182 in the high energy limit , while the hsd results for @xmath34 demonstrate a monotonic increase with collision energy .",
    "we find that the hsd model can qualitatively reproduce the measured excitation function for the @xmath0 ratio fluctuations in central au+au ( or pb+pb ) collisions from low sps up to top rhic energies .",
    "we have shown that accounting for the experimental acceptance as well as the centrality selection has a relatively small influence on @xmath174 and does not change the shape of the @xmath174 excitation function .",
    "we conclude , that the hsd hadron - string model - which does not have a qgp phase transition and not explicitly includes the quark and gluon degrees of freedom - can reproduce qualitatively the experimental excitation function .",
    "in particular , it gives the rise of @xmath174 with decreasing bombarding energy .",
    "this fact brings us to the conclusion that the observable enhancement of @xmath174 at low sps energies might dominantly signal non - equilibrium string dynamics rather than a phase transition of hadronic to partonic matter or the qcd critical point .",
