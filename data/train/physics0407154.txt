    "our results apply also to this case , but in the further discussion we will mainly focus on the cases of integer values of @xmath19 .",
    "considering a homogeneous gas of @xmath25 point particles confined in a container of volume @xmath26 and coupled to a bath of temperature @xmath27 , the free energy can be written in the form @xmath28 @xmath29 is the free energy per particle .",
    "the mean separation @xmath30 between particles is related to the volume per particle @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the dimension of the system .",
    "the pressure follows then from @xmath33 .",
    "we begin with the consideration of a _ classical gas _ with fixed exponent @xmath19 of the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dispersion_relation ] ) . in this case",

    "this suggest @xmath46 . clearly @xmath47 should occur in the free energy in combination with another volume to make the argument of the logarithm dimensionless .",

    "the planck constant of action @xmath55 appears as a new parameter .",
    "the pressure is now no longer uniquely fixed by dimensional analysis since in order to determine the four exponents of @xmath56 and @xmath55 only three relations ( from the comparison of the powers of @xmath39 , @xmath38 and @xmath37 ) exist .",

    "from the mutual order of the three length scales @xmath73 and @xmath74 _ six _",
    "regions can be distinguished @xcite . anticipating the result of the detailed discussions of the following sections these six regions exhibit very different physical properties :    ( i ) @xmath75 : :    : this is the region of classical behavior .",
    "the only relevant length    scale is the the inter - particle distance @xmath30 .",
    "( ii ) @xmath76 : :    : the region of non - relativistic quantum behavior .",
    "fermions are    degenerated , bosons condense . since    @xmath77 relativistic    effects do not play a role .",
    "( iii ) @xmath78 : :    : a region of quantum behavior where bosons behave    non - relativistically ( as in ( iii ) ) whereas fermions exhibit    relativistic effects .",
    "the pauli principle makes the difference .",
    "( iv ) @xmath79 : :    : fermions show still low temperature behavior ( as in ( iii ) ) , bosons    exhibit particle - antiparticle pair production .",
    "( v ) @xmath80 : :    : fermions and bosons are described by the same equation of state as    photons .",
    "( vi ) @xmath81 : :    : same behavior as in ( v ) .",
    "bose condensation as well as particle - antiparticle pair production will in general change the effective inter - particle distance from @xmath30 to @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "since pair production keeps some of the quantum numbers constant ( e.g. the total charge or the lepton or hadron number ) in these regions @xmath30 is a measure of the corresponding quantum number of the gas .    for",
    "_ charged _ fermions dimensional analysis gives a further intrinsic length scale , the bohr radius @xmath84 . for simplicity",
    "we consider again a gas of electrons on a positively charged background . to have still an ideal gas the coulomb interaction @xmath85 has to be small compared to the kinetic energy . for non - relativistic electrons",
    "this results in @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 . for relativistic electrons",
    "one obtains in the same way @xmath88 or @xmath89 , i.e. , the ideal gas condition is always fulfilled . for non - relativistic charged bosons outside the condensate",
    ", @xmath30 has to be replaced by @xmath90 ( see below ) which leads to the condition @xmath91 .",
    "the effect of coulomb interaction will be more pronounced in the condensate since the kinetic energy is zero .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that there is _ no _ bose condensation in the presence of coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "the different regions of the parameter space can be visualized in the diagram depicted in figure [ fig : idal_gas1 ] where we plot @xmath92 versus @xmath93 in a double logarithmic representation .",
    "the lines @xmath94 and @xmath95 correspond to the horizontal and vertical axis , respectively .",
    "the line @xmath96 separates the classical region @xmath97 from the quantum region @xmath98 . in our double logarithmic plot",
    "this line is straight with a slope equal to @xmath99 .",
    "ordinary massive matter at temperatures realized on earth is restricted to the region below the horizontal axis . for electrons @xmath100 , and",
    "hence for room temperatures @xmath101 this region is given by @xmath102 .",
    "the bohr radius @xmath103 corresponds to @xmath104 .",
    "so far we assumed that the particle number @xmath105 and hence @xmath30 was fixed .",
    "in some cases it is more appropriate to consider the grand canonical description where instead of @xmath25 the _ chemical _ _ potential _",
    "@xmath4 is given .",
    "this description is in particular useful in those parameter regions where particle creation and annihilation processes ( like the inverse @xmath106-decay or electron - positron pair creation ) become important .",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic potential @xmath107 is related to the pressure by the gibbs - duham relation @xmath108 since @xmath27 and @xmath4 have the same dimension there is _ no _ intrinsic length scale and hence no purely classical expression for the pressure . if we include @xmath55 as a further parameter @xmath109 appears as the _ only _ length scale of the problem .",
    "@xmath110 is so far an arbitrary but dimensionless function of @xmath111 .",
    "following our previous dimensional arguments the pressure can now be written as @xcite @xmath112 with @xmath113 likewise so far unknown . for particles with vanishing chemical potential",
    "the pressure is _ always _ given by equation ( [ eq : p_grand_canonical ] ) with @xmath114 .",
    "important examples are photons , magnons in anti - ferromagnets and acoustical phonons ( all @xmath14 ) , magnons in ferromagnets ( @xmath15 ) and ripplons ( @xmath115 ) .    with ( [ eq : j ] ) we get @xmath116 and hence @xmath117 using the classical equation of state ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) this requires @xmath118 .",
    "hence for a classical gas @xmath119 ( [ eq : p_grand_canonical ] ) and ( [ eq : omega_of_mu / t ] ) can be used to calculate the chemical potential of the classical gas @xcite @xmath120",
    "since for @xmath121 the system has to approach the classical limit we make the following ansatz for the pressure @xmath122 with @xmath123 . here the subscript f or b stands for fermions or bosons .",
    "the scaling function @xmath124 describes the cross - over from classical to quantum behavior of particles with a dispersion relation with fixed value of @xmath19 . for massive particles",
    "this ansatz can be generalized to @xmath125 which describes in addition also the cross - over from non - relativistic to ultra - relativistic behavior .",
    "the scaling function @xmath126 can be related to ( [ eq : p_scaling_ansatz ] ) in the limiting cases @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively . in the non - relativistic limit @xmath129 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath127 , @xmath130 . in the ultra - relativistic case @xmath71 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath128 , @xmath131 . in the following",
    "we will mainly concentrate on the discussion of @xmath132 .",
    "we consider first the case of _ weak _ _ quantum _ _ fluctuations_. assuming that the pressure can be expanded in powers of the particle density , i.e. in powers of @xmath133 , ( the classical result ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) is the lowest order term of this expansion ) @xmath132 can be written in the form @xmath134 here the plus and minus sign corresponds to fermions and bosons , respectively . indeed ,",
    "for fermions the pauli principle will lead to an increase of the pressure with respect to the classical case . for bosons",
    "the pressure is reduced since quantum mechanics increases the probability for the double occupancy of a state @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : x ] ) , ( [ eq : p_scaling_ansatz ] ) and ( [ eq : p_weak_corrections ] ) describe indeed the lowest order quantum correction to the classical equation of state@xcite .",
    "in the _ strong quantum limit _ @xmath135 , we have even more pronounced differences between fermions and bosons . for _ fermions _ the pauli - principle guarantees a non - zero pressure even for @xmath136 .",
    "from ( [ eq : x ] ) and ( [ eq : p_scaling_ansatz ] ) this requires @xmath137 and hence @xmath138 on the r.h.s .",
    "we have introduced the _ fermi _ _ energy _ @xmath139 which is the kinetic energy of the fermions with momentum @xmath140 .",
    "apparently , in ( [ eq : p_fermions_general ] ) the fermi energy replaces the temperatures of the classical expression ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) .",
    "in particular this gives for relativistic particles @xcite @xmath141 and for non - relativistic particles @xcite @xmath142 respectively .",
    "both cases can be combined in the scaling formula @xmath143 the precise form of the scaling function @xmath144 remains unknown in this approach .",
    "the cross - over between ( [ eq : p_fermions_non - relativistic ] ) and ( [ eq : p_fermions_relativistic ] ) takes place at @xmath145 , as follows from the general properties of @xmath144 discussed before .",
    "as long as @xmath76 ( region ( ii ) in figure 1 ) the particles show non - relativistic quantum behavior .",
    "this situation exists e.g. for electrons in solids ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 ) or neutrons in neutron stars ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) .    on the other hand , for @xmath150",
    "the kinetic energy is larger than @xmath3 and the particles behave relativistically .",
    "one has to expect that this low temperature relativistic quantum behavior is seen as long as the temperature is small compared to the fermi energy @xmath151 , i.e. for @xmath152 ( corresponding to regions ( iii ) and ( iv ) of figure 1 ) .",
    "relativistic electrons exist e.g. in white dwarfs ( @xmath148 ) .    for _ very _ _",
    "dense _ systems of atoms , where nuclei and electrons form a plasma with @xmath153 , electrons and protons may _ recombine _ to produce a neutron and a neutrino ( the inverse @xmath106-decay ) .",
    "the charge of the resulting nucleus is then reduced by one . in this case",
    "the electron density is no longer an independent variable but determined by the chemical potential @xmath154 of this process .",
    "if @xmath155 and initially @xmath156 the system is in the ultra - relativistic region , thermal fluctuations can be neglected .",
    "@xmath157 determines then unambigously a new length scale @xmath158 corresponding to @xmath159 in ( [ eq : lambda_grand_canonical ] ) which replaces @xmath30 in the region @xmath160 in eq.([eq : p_fermions_relativistic ] ) .",
    "since thermal fluctuations are irrelevant and @xmath30 is not longer fixed , @xmath27 is replaced by @xmath161 in all expressions .",
    "the pressure is therefore reduced to @xcite @xmath162    we come now to a discussion of the parameter region of ultra - high temperatures of fermionic systems where particle - antiparticle _ pair production _ becomes important ( regions ( v ) and ( vi ) of figure 1 ) . in this region",
    "the particle number is not conserved and it is more adequate to describe the system by specifying a chemical potential , as we have done in subsection [ grand_canonical_description ] . for simplicity",
    "we assume that only fermions of the same kind ( and their corresponding antiparticles ) are generated .",
    "as discussed in subsection [ quantum_case ] the coulomb interaction can be neglected since the effective particle distance turns out to be much smaller than the bohr radius @xmath103 . for temperatures @xmath163 the pressure",
    "is determined by ( [ eq : p_grand_canonical ] ) with @xmath164 and @xmath14 ( since we are in the relativistic region ) , i.e. @xcite @xmath165 which agrees with the result for photons ( compare ( [ eq : p_grand_canonical ] ) ) .",
    "hence we will call ( [ eq : p_fermions_radiation ] ) _ radiation _ _ behavior_. @xmath83 has to be considered as the mean distance between the fermions which is here smaller than @xmath30 because of pair production .",
    "if several kinds of fermions exist each of it gives the same contribution ( [ eq : p_fermions_radiation ] ) to the pressure .",
    "finally we consider the cross - over between ( [ eq : p_fermions_radiation ] ) and the pressure formulas valid at lower temperature .",
    "we begin with the region @xmath166 . lowering temperature",
    "we expect a cross - over to the classical result ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) . to describe the cross - over we have to understand the contribution of pair production if we raise temperature starting in the classical region .",
    "it is therefore convenient to use a grand canonical description also for the description of this cross - over . to make contact with the classical result ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) , we have to express the chemical potential of particles and anti - particles in terms of the parameters of the system .",
    "particles and anti - particles can annihilate into photons . since the sum of the chemical potentials is conserved in this reaction @xcite and the chemical potential of photons is zero , we find that the chemical potentials of particle and anti - particles have opposite sign , say @xmath167 . from ( [ eq : p_grand_canonical ] ) and ( [ eq : omega_of_mu / t ] ) we conclude that in the classical region the density of particles and anti - particles , respectively , is given by @xmath168 here",
    "we have included explicitly the term @xmath169 resulting from the shift of the energy scale discussed in [ introduction ] .",
    "if the density of _ generated _ particles is small compared to the initial density @xmath170 such that @xmath171 we get after elementary manipulations for the density of the generated particles @xmath172 the cross - over to the radiation region sets in if the density ( [ eq : pair_density_fermions ] ) of generated particles is a finite fraction of the initial density @xmath170 .",
    "this gives for the cross - over line @xmath173 ( compare figure 2 ) @xmath174    in the relativistic region @xmath156 essentially the same arguments apply but now we have to replace @xmath82 by @xmath83 in ( [ eq : particle_antiparticle_density ] ) .",
    "the cross - over follows then at @xmath175 which corresponds for @xmath156 essentially to @xmath176 ( compare figure 2 ) , in agreement with our previous conjecture .      for _ bosons _ the low temperature pressure can not depend on the volume since all bosons may accumulate in the state of lowest energy .",
    "this requires in ( [ eq : p_scaling_ansatz ] ) @xmath177 from which we get for the pressure @xmath178 where on the r.h.s .",
    "we introduced the temperature of _ bose condensation _",
    "@xmath179    in particular , we get for relativistic particles @xcite @xmath180 and for non - relativistic particles @xcite @xmath181 again both the relativistic and the non - relativistic case can be combined into the scaling form @xmath182 the cross - over between ( [ eq : p_bosons_non - relativistic ] ) and ( [ eq : p_bosons_relativistic ] ) occurs at @xmath183 , i.e. at @xmath184 .    since @xmath185 the pressure is _ reduced _ with respect to the classical result ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) .",
    "this can be explained by assuming that a finite fraction of particles sits now in the state of zero energy and hence does not contribute to the pressure . comparing ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) and ( [ eq : p_bosons ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath186 has to be considered as the mean distance of particles _ above _ the condensate @xcite .",
    "next we discuss the phase diagram of massive bose particles obeying the full dispersion relation ( [ eq : relativistic_dispersion_relation ] ) .",
    "we begin with the classical region @xmath187 where the pressure is given by ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) . reducing @xmath27",
    "we reach at @xmath188 the region where a macroscopic fraction of particles does not contribute to the pressure since it is in the state of zero energy .",
    "as argued above , the number @xmath189 of the remaining particles of finite energy can be written as @xmath190 thence the number of particles in the condensate is @xmath191 which shows that @xmath192 is indeed the transition temperature of bose condensation @xcite . if one enters the condensed phase by lowering @xmath27 at _ fixed _",
    "@xmath30 , the total number of bosons remains fixed whereas the mean distance of the particles above the condensate is equal to @xmath193 , which increases if we further decrease temperature .    on the other hand , if one approaches the transition line by decreasing @xmath30 at _ fixed _",
    "@xmath27 , the mean distance @xmath90 between particles above the condensate remains constant ( since @xmath27 is constant ) whereas the excess particles go to the ground state .",
    "this behavior is seen also for @xmath150 since the effective distance of particles contributing to the pressure remains @xmath194 ( compare fig.3 ) .",
    "thus , bose condensation as described by equations ( [ eq : p_bosons_non - relativistic ] ) and ( [ eq : condensate ] ) is seen both in regions ( ii ) and ( iii ) of figure 1 .    at sufficiently high temperatures we have to expect that production of particle - antiparticle pairs sets in . for simplicity",
    "we will again assume that only bosons of the same type can be created ( and their anti - particles ) .",
    "at temperatures @xmath195 bosons behave relativistically and the pressure is given by ( [ eq : p_bosons_relativistic ] ) .    the discussion of the cross - over to ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) if @xmath196 and to ( [ eq : p_bosons_non - relativistic ] ) if @xmath156 , respectively , follows essentially the same lines as in the case of fermions , with the important difference that in describing the cross - over in the region @xmath197 the effective particle distance is now @xmath82 ( instead of @xmath30 as in the case of fermions ) .",
    "from ( [ eq : pair_density_fermions ] ) we therefore conclude that the cross - over occurs at @xmath198 .",
    "note , that the cross - over is smooth , since at @xmath184 , @xmath199 if @xmath156 .    since in the relativistic region ( iv ) , @xmath79 , the effective particle density @xmath200 is smaller than @xmath170 one is inclined to conclude that here both pair creation and bose condensation takes place . for @xmath196",
    "the cross - over is the same as for fermions .",
    "an important application of the various equations of state can be found in the history of _ stars _ which we present here in a cartoon like picture .",
    "initially the star burns hydrogen to helium and other light elements and keeps in this way its temperature @xmath27 .",
    "the ratio @xmath201 is of the order @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the proton mass .",
    "this is the present situation of our sun .",
    "the pressure of a star can roughly be described by the classical equation ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) , which counteracts the gravitational pressure @xmath204 here @xmath205 and @xmath37 denote the radius and the mass of the star , respectively , and @xmath206 is the gravitational constant .",
    "we do not present the derivation of ( [ eq : star ] ) , which is straightforward , but remark that @xmath207 is the gravitational energy of a sphere @xmath208 , as one obtains also from a dimensional argument .",
    "the ratio of the mass to the radius of a star in this state is controlled by the thermal equation of state ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) .",
    "indeed , from the equality of ( [ eq : p_classical ] ) and ( [ eq : star ] ) follows @xmath209 , which increases linearly with temperature .",
    "once the nuclear fuel is exhausted , temperature can not be kept and the star collapses under the graviational force . as a result the density increases and the star matter crosses over to the region ( ii ) of figure 1 , where the pressure is given by ( [ eq : p_fermions_non - relativistic ] ) .",
    "since the pressure is now inversely proportional to the mass , mainly the electrons contribute to it .",
    "once under further contraction @xmath30 has reached @xmath210 ( corresponding to densities of the order @xmath211 ) ( [ eq : p_fermions_relativistic ] ) has to be applied for the pressure .",
    "the star has reached the state of a _ white dwarf_(compare figure 2 ) .    if the density is increased further ( i.e. @xmath212 ) ,",
    "neutrons are generated via the inverse @xmath106-decay .",
    "the pressure is determined then by ( [ eq : p_inverse_beta_decay ] ) until most of the nucleons became neutrons . for the pressure in _ neutron stars _",
    "formulas ( [ eq : p_fermions_non - relativistic ] ) for @xmath196 and ( [ eq : p_fermions_relativistic ] ) for @xmath156 again apply , but the mass @xmath213 is now that of the neutrons ( compare figure 2 ) .",
    "this is the fate of stars with a mass between 15 and 30 times the mass of the sun .    in the ultra - relativistic regions of white dwarfs and neutrons",
    "stars the equality between ( [ eq : star ] ) and ( [ eq : p_fermions_relativistic ] ) results in a relation for the mass @xmath214 this so - called _ chandrasekhar mass _ @xmath215 is the maximum mass of white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "its value is determined by the thermal equation of state in region ( iii ) and is of the order of twice the mass of the sun .      as a second illustration let us consider a _",
    "contracting toy universe _ . for simplicity , this universe is supposed to have no gravity , i.e. there are no stars , clouds of cosmic dust etc .",
    ", just photons and diluted massive particles . to make things even simpler",
    "the only particles assumed to exist are hydrogen atoms ( a  non - metallic  universe in the language of astronomers ) .",
    "initially the photon spectrum is assumed to correspond to black body radiation of about 3k . since for massless particles @xmath216 is the only existing length scale , the typical distance of photons is of the order @xmath217 .",
    "the number of h - atoms per @xmath218 is assumed to be of order 1 .",
    "hydrogen atoms are bosons and hence could be represented in figure [ fig : ideal_gas1_bosons ] .",
    "the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the hydrogen gas in figure [ fig : ideal_gas1_bosons ] are given by @xmath219 and @xmath220 , respectively , i.e. they are outside of the margins of this figure . @xmath221 is the compton wave length of hydrogen .",
    "next we switch on the cosmic contraction , i.e. we go backwards in time .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the contraction factor @xmath222 , where @xmath223 denotes the distance at an earlier time @xmath224 when the final distance was @xmath225 .",
    "since contraction of space reduces the wavelength of photons such that @xmath226 with @xmath227 , i.e. the photon gas heats up .    without coupling to the photons ,",
    "the hydrogen atoms form a classical non - relativistic gas ( region ( i ) of figure 1 ) which contracts adiabatically .",
    "its temperature @xmath228 rises proportional to @xmath229 , _ provided _ there is enough interaction between the hydrogen atoms to reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the hydrogen gas in figure 3 thence change according to @xmath230 and @xmath231 , respectively .",
    "when the temperature of the photons reaches about @xmath232 ( @xmath233 ) , the hydrogen atoms have a distance of about @xmath234 and are now partially ionized , i.e. we have free protons and electrons , both fermions , which appear in figure [ fig : ideal_gas1_fermions ] . since both particles are charged , they will emit and adsorb photons . from now on matter and radiation have approximately the same temperature @xmath235 .",
    "the initial coordinates are @xmath236 , @xmath237 ( i.e. @xmath238 ) for protons and @xmath239 , @xmath240 ( i.e. @xmath241 ) for electrons , respectively .",
    "thus their initial positions are in region ( i ) of figure 1 .",
    "as long as @xmath242 , electrons and protons form initially an non - interacting non - relativistic classical plasma ( compare figure 2 ) . since @xmath243 and @xmath244 , the slope of the path under further contraction in the double logarithmic plot of figure 2 is @xmath245 and remains unchanged until we reach the relativistic region @xmath246 .    when the contraction parameter reaches @xmath247 , i.e temperatures reach about @xmath248 ,",
    "the mean particle distance is of the order of the bohr radius .",
    "when temperatures reach the rest energy of the electrons , i.e. crossing the bisecting line @xmath249 of figure 2 , the electrons start to behave relativistically . for @xmath250 electron - positron pairs",
    "are formed and leptons behave ultra - relativistically . for temperatures @xmath251 and @xmath252 hadrons decay into quarks and anti - quarks , which also behave ultra - relativistically . also their mean distance is now determined by pair production .",
    "in addition gluons , i.e. the bosons which carry the interaction between quarks , have to be considered .",
    "eventually the coordinates of all fundamental fermions and bosons reach the line @xmath176 .",
    "the pressure in all cases is that or ultra - relativistic fermions ( [ eq : p_fermions_radiation ] ) or bosons ( [ eq : p_bosons_relativistic ] ) , respectively .",
    "the total pressure is the sum of these contributions , i.e. it is proportional to the number of different fermions and bosons .",
    "we can also use the results of the previous chapters to determine the scaling behavior of the _ free _ _ energy _",
    "@xmath29 per particle which can be written as @xmath253 differentiation with respect to @xmath31 gives @xmath254 thus @xmath255 .",
    "the entropy per particle @xmath256 follows from @xmath257 and hence we get for the energy per particle @xmath258 @xmath259 which is the well known relation between the energy @xmath258 and @xmath260 both for relativistic and non - relativistic particle in any dimension@xcite . for the chemical potential @xmath4 we obtain from the gibbs - duham relation @xmath261 with our anstze used above we find at low temperatures @xmath262 for fermions and @xmath263 for bosons .",
    "these expressions can be used to calculate additional thermodynamic quantities .",
    "specific _ _ heat _ follows from ( [ eq : dif_f ] ) as @xmath264 for _ fermions _ our ansatz @xmath265 , i.e. @xmath266 , gives @xmath267 instead of the correct result @xmath268 .",
    "this is not surprising since we determined @xmath269 from the condition that the free energy should go to a constant ( the fermi energy ) for @xmath270 .    to get the correct specific heat we have to add finite temperature corrections to @xmath258 .",
    "indeed , the low temperature corrections to energy of the _ fermi gas _ result from the difference @xmath271 of the fermi distribution at non - zero and zero temperatures ( the latter is the step function ) .",
    "these corrections are of the form @xcite @xmath272 where @xmath273 , and @xmath274 is the density of states which is smooth at @xmath275 . with @xmath276",
    "it is clear that the low temperature expansion of @xmath258 includes only _ even _ powers in @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath277 is the only energy scale , the low temperature expansion of the energy of the ideal fermi gas is therefore of the form @xmath278 which is the sommerfeld expansion .",
    "this gives for the specific heat @xmath279 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , calculating the compressibility we get with @xmath280 immediately the correct result @xmath281                    antiferromagnets are magnets with an opposite magnetization on two inter - penetrating sublattices .",
