    "the predicted ssfrs of low  mass galaxies are lower than the observed ones beyond the uncertainty level . a first guess to solve such a conflict within the context of the hierarchical cosmogony is to propose that the main stellar formation epoch of low mass galaxies is delayed by some astrophysical processes to lower redshifts .",

    "what follows , we turn out to self  consistent models of disk galaxy formation and evolution to explore this question .",
    "the formation and evolution of disc galaxies within growing dark matter halos can be followed in a transparent and _ self - consistent _ way by using simplified hydrodynamic models of discs in centrifugal and vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , and with a sf mechanism triggered by a disc instability criterion and self  regulated by an energy balance process ( the _ semi - numerical _ approach ; fa2000 ; avila - reese & firmani 2000 ; see for similar approaches van den bosch 2000 ; naab & ostriker 2006 ; stringer & benson 2007 ; dutton & van den bosch 2009 hereafter dvdb09 ) .",
    "the main physical ingredients of the models used here are as follows . a special extended press ",
    "schechter approach based on the conditional probability ( lacey & cole 1993 ) is used to generate the halo mass accretion histories ( mahs ) from the primordial gaussian density fluctuation field . a generalized secondary infall model with elliptical orbits",
    "is applied to calculate the time  by  time virialization of the accreting mass shells ( avila - reese et al .",
    "the orbit ellipticity parameter is fixed in such a way that the structure of the   haloes agrees with results from cosmological n ",
    "body simulations ( avila - reese et al . 1999 ; fa2000 ) .",
    "a ( baryon ) fraction of the mass of each accreting shell is assumed to cool down in a dynamical time and form a disc layer   the radiative cooling time is ever shorter than the hubble time , @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , this assumption works well for halos of this mass and smaller . for larger masses ,",
    "the cooling time becomes larger than @xmath39 .",
    "then , the mass baryon fraction available to form the galaxy decreases systematically with mass . ] .",
    "we call primary cosmological gas accretion that one related to these accreting mass shells with an universal baryon fraction @xmath57 for the cosmology adopted here . the final galaxy baryon fraction , @xmath58 , is determined by the further disc gas ejecting and infalling processes .    the accreting mass shells at the time of their virialization , @xmath59 , are assumed to rotate rigidly with a specific angular momentum calculated as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 represents a difference between two time steps , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , are the halo total angular momentum , mass , and energy respectively ; @xmath65 is the halo spin parameter , assumed to be _ constant in time_. as a result of the assembling of these mass shells , a present  day halo ends with an angular momentum distribution close to the ( universal ) distribution measured in n - body simulations ( bullock et al .",
    "the radial mass distribution of the layer is calculated by equating its specific angular momentum to that of its final circular orbit in centrifugal equilibrium ( detailed angular momentum conservation ) .",
    "the superposition of these layers form a gaseous disc , which tends to be steeper in the centre and flatter at the periphery than the exponential law .",
    "the gravitational interaction of disc and inner halo during their assembly is calculated using the adiabatic invariance formalism .",
    "a further step is the calculation of the _ stellar _ surface density profile . the previously mentioned processes and the fact that sf is less efficient at the periphery than in the centre produces stellar discs with a nearly exponential surface density distribution , and the size mainly determined by @xmath65 .",
    "the disc sf at a given radius ( assuming azimuthal symmetry ) is triggered by the toomre gas gravitational instability criterion and self  regulated by a balance between the energy input due to sne and the turbulent energy dissipation in the ism .",
    "both ingredients determine the gas disc height and the sf rate .",
    "this physical prescription naturally yields a schmidt - kennicutt - like law .",
    "the sf efficiency depends on the gas surface density determined mainly by @xmath65 , and on the gas infall history , which in its primary phase is proportional to the halo mah .      in our previous works",
    ", we did not take into account disc mass outflows ( galactic super - winds ) due to sn and radiation pressure feedback .",
    "therefore , the driving factor for disc growth was solely the gas infall rate assumed proportional to the halo mass aggregation rate , where the proportionality coefficient is the galaxy baryon mass fraction , .",
    "this fraction was fixed to a constant value smaller than the universal baryon fraction , , by a factor @xmath66 . with this simple assumption ,",
    "nearly flat rotation curves at the present and at higher redshifts , and good agreement with observed disc scaling relations were obtained ( e.g. , fa00 ; avila - reese et al .",
    "2008 ; firmani & avila - reese 2009 ) .    here",
    "we introduce an algorithm for outflows from the disc similar to those used in the sams but applied _ locally _ to the evolving disc ",
    "halo system as a function of the radius ( dvdb09 ) .",
    "the outflow is assumed to move at the local escape velocity of the disc  halo system , ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "( [ outflow ] ) and the parameter @xmath72 can be interpreted as the fraction of sn kinetic energy transferred into the outflow . for the latter case ( @xmath79 ) , by assuming that each sn produces a momentum @xmath80kms@xmath78 and using the same value of @xmath81 as above , the normalization velocity in eq .",
    "( [ outflow ] ) should be @xmath82 kms@xmath78 ; by keeping 1000 kms@xmath78 in eq .",

    "2009 ) ; the total momentum ( energy ) injected by massive stars during their life is much higher than the one injected by sne .    because the outflow rate is proportional to the sfr ( eq . [ outflow ] ) , the outflows are more efficient in removing gas at earlier epochs , when the sfr is higher .",
    "the early accreted gas has lower angular momentum than the later accreted gas .",
    "thus , as the result of disc gas ejection by outflows , the spin parameter @xmath83 of the final disc becomes larger than the spin in case of no outflows , which , by assumption , is equal to the halo spin parameter ( see also dvdb09 ) .",

    "the results by lee et al .",
    "( 2007 ) show that a significant fraction of such galaxies are undergoing strong episodic sf fluctuations due to the large scatter in their ssfrs .",

    "2004 ; salim et al . 2007 ;",
    "schiminovich et al .",

    "these models show , more from a statistical point of view than at the galaxy individual evolution level , that the population of relatively small galaxies ( @xmath161 ) is mostly assembled at higher redshifts becoming older , redder , and with ( much ) lower ssfrs at later epochs than the observed galaxies in the same mass range .",
    "our models clearly show that less massive galaxies assemble their stars early because their dark halos assemble early ( earlier on average than more massive ones ) , and that sn ",

    "besides , it should be taken into account that a significant fraction of the sf  feedback energy is actually dissipated into the disc ism turbulence .",
    "concerning the sf physics in our models , it should be said that the sf is assumed stationary ( self  regulated ) and related only to disc internal processes ( isolated galaxy ) .",
