    "these cosmological shocks are a ubiquitous consequence of cosmic structure formation .",
    "they are tracers of the large - scale structure and contain information about its dynamical history .",
    "gas in walls and filaments follows the gravitational potential towards clusters of galaxies , colliding with the intracluster medium ( icm ) at speeds of @xmath9 km s@xmath10 .",
    "while cosmological shocks heat the icm to temperatures of @xmath11 k , filaments are heated to temperatures of @xmath12 k , making their detection at present time challenging , since at this temperature there are hardly any emission lines .",
    "therefore , the study of shocks may provide an independent and complementary way to study the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) , the low density intergalactic medium of the cosmic web that is believed to host the majority of the fraction of the baryon density .",
    "some cosmological shocks are associated with diffuse radio emission caused by electrons accelerated to relativistic velocities by fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "this diffuse radio emission , without galaxy counterpart , is usually divided into two classes , namely _ radio halos _ and _ radio relics_. radio halos are unpolarized and have diffuse morphologies that are similar to those of the thermal x - ray emission of the cluster gas @xcite .",
    "they are usually found in the center of clusters with significant substructure ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "radio relics , on the other hand , are typically located near the periphery of the cluster .",
    "they have been observed in several merging galaxy clusters .",
    "they often exhibit sharp emission edges and many of them show strong radio polarization .",
    "once accelerated , the electrons are short - lived because of the inverse compton scattering and synchrotron energy losses , and their spectrum rapidly steepens from the shock edge @xcite the synchrotron nature of this radio emission indicates the presence of cluster magnetic fields of the order of @xmath13 @xmath8 g @xcite .",

    "however , a few merger shocks have been detected in nearby x - ray bright galaxy clusters @xcite and may be possible associated with a single or double radio relics discovered in a number of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "they showed that shocks form abundantly in the course of structure formation and their topology is very complex and highly connected .",
    "they also stated that considering the large size and long lifetime of shocks , they are potentially interesting sites for cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) found that shocks form around sheets , filaments and knots of mass distribution when the gas in void regions accretes onto them .",
    "@xcite studied the properties of structure formation shock waves in cosmological sph simulations , allowing them to study their role in the thermalization of the plasma as well as for the acceleration of relativistic crs through diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "they find that most of the energy is dissipated in weak internal shocks , with mach number @xmath14 . on the other hand , collapsed cosmological structures are surrounded by external shocks with much higher mach numbers ( @xmath15 ) , but they play only a minor role in the energy balance of thermalization .",
    "@xcite computed the production of crs in a cosmological simulation volume , finding that crs are dynamically important in galaxy clusters .",
    "they also found that shocks with low mach number typically trace mergers and complex flows , while those with mild and high mach number ( @xmath16 ) generally follow accretion onto filaments . in a similar study",
    ", @xcite analyzed the properties of large - scale shocks .",
    "they find that the bulk of the energy in galaxy clusters is dissipated at weak shocks , with mach numbers @xmath17 , although slightly stronger shocks are found in the external regions of merging clusters .",
    "@xcite used gadget simulations of a sample of galaxy clusters , implementing a formalism for cr physics on top of radiative hydrodynamics .",
    "they modeled relativistic electrons that are accelerated at cosmic formation shocks and produced in hadronic interactions of crs with protons of the icm .",
    "they found that the radio emission in clusters is dominated by secondary electrons . only at the location of strong shocks the contribution of primary electrons",
    "may dominate .",
    "later , @xcite studied the radio emission for a sample of 10 galaxy clusters extracted from zoomed cosmological simulations .",
    "they determined the radio luminosity , spectral index and faraday rotation measure for regions of the relics and concluded that upcoming radio telescopes , such as lofar , mwa , lwa and ska will discover a substantially larger sample of radio relics .",
    "ska should probe the macroscopic parameters of plasma physics in clusters .",
    "@xcite investigated the diffuse radio emission from clusters in cosmological sph simulations .",
    "they found that the maximum diffuse radio emission in clusters depends strongly on their x - ray temperature .",
    "they also found that the so - called accretion shocks cause only very little radio emission .",
    "they conclude that a moderate efficiency of shock acceleration , namely @xmath5 , together with moderate magnetic field , namely 0.07 - 0.8 @xmath8 g , in the region of radio relic are sufficient to reproduce the number density and luminosity of radio relics .",
    "@xcite , using amr simulations , also studied radio emission in galaxy clusters .",
    "they investigated scaling relations between cluster parameters such as synchrotron power , mass and x - ray luminosity .    in this paper",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite but , instead of focusing on galaxy clusters , we investigate whether it is possible to detect radio emission in the entire cosmic web . due to the low temperature of the accreting gas , the mach number of external shocks - filaments - is high , extending up to @xmath15 or higher @xcite",
    ". therefore , the total radio power generated by infall along filaments will be significantly weaker than infall into a cluster .",
    "we will try to determine this total radio power . to this end",

    "this shock finder is applied to a large @xmath18-body / sph simulation . for computing the radio emission",
    ", we follow the model elaborated in @xcite .",
    "they assumed that electrons are accelerated by diffuse shock acceleration and cool subsequently by synchrotron and inverse compton losses .",
    "consequently , the radio emission can be expressed as a function of downstream plasma properties , mach number and surface area of the shock front . in order to correctly assign a surface area to the sph particles",
    ", we calibrate the radio emission using shock tubes experiments . of primary importance",
    "is the proper identification of the different structures that reside in the cosmic web . to this end , we apply the spineweb technique ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) to the entire simulation .",
    "the spineweb procedure correctly identifies voids , walls , filaments and clusters present in the cosmic web .",
    "it is a powerful method that deals with the topology of the underlying density field of the cosmic web .",
    "this allows us to study shock properties and radio emission in the different structures that constitutes the cosmic web .",
    "this goes beyond the traditionally internal versus external shock classification suggested by @xcite and the method of characterizing shocks by their pre - shock overdensity and temperature proposed by @xcite . applying the radio emission model to",

    "section  [ sec : spineweb ] describes the spineweb method . in section  [ sec : hydroshocks ] we give a brief description of the physics involving non - radiative shocks and depict how we find shocks in sph simulations . in order to calibrate the radio emission model",
    ", we use shock tube tests which are described in section  [ sec : shocktubes ] .",
    "the radio emission model is sensitive to the shock surface area . using the results of the shock tubes , in section  [ sec : shockarea ]",
    "we described the method used in order to precisely determine the area of the shock front . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our results for the shock fronts and radio emission in the marenostrum universe . in section  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] we summarize our findings .",
    "in order to study cosmological shock waves in the large - scale structure of the universe , we use the _ marenostrum universe _",
    "simulation @xcite , one of the largest cosmological simulations available .",
    "it assumes a standard flat @xmath19cdm universe with cosmological parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where the hubble parameter is given by @xmath24 km s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 .",
    "the normalization of the power spectrum is @xmath25 .",
    "the simulation box has a side length of 500@xmath26mpc and contains 1024@xmath27 gas and 1024@xmath27 dark matter particles , with masses of @xmath28m@xmath29 and @xmath30m@xmath29 .",
    "the initial conditions are followed from a redshift of @xmath31 until the present time ( @xmath32 ) using the massively parallel tree @xmath18-body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are at present time ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "radiative processes or star formation are not included in the simulation .",
    "the plummer - equivalent softening was set at @xmath33 @xmath26kpc in comoving units , and the sph smoothing length was set to the distance to the 40th nearest neighbor of each sph particle .",
    "smoothing scales are not allowed to be smaller than the gravitational softening of the gas particles .    to extract the groups and galaxy clusters present in the simulation , we use hop @xcite .",
    "hop assigns a density to every particle by smoothing the density field with a spline cubic kernel using the @xmath34 nearest neighbors of a given particle .",
    "particles are then linked by associating each particle to the densest particle from the list of its closest neighbor .",
    "this process is repeated until it reaches a particle that is its own highest density neighbor .",
    "all particles linked to a local density maximum are identified as a group . at this stage",
    ", no distinction between a high - density region and its surrounding has been make . to identify halos above a certain density threshold ,",
    "a regrouping merging procedure is performed .",
    "the code first includes only particles that are above some density threshold .",
    "then , it merges all groups for which the boundary density between them exceeds a certain density value . finally , all groups identified must have one particle that exceeds a density peak to be accepted as an independent group .",
    "we associate this density peak with the virial density needed for a spherical region to be in virial equilibrium , @xmath35 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is obtained from the solution to the collapse of a spherical top - hat perturbation under the assumption that the object has just virialized .",
    "for the cosmology described here , at present time its value is @xmath36 .    in using hop , we use the dark matter particles of the marenostrum simulation .",
    "once we identified the virialized halos of the sample , we take the position of the densest dark matter particle as a first estimate of the center of mass . subsequently , we add the gas particles , grow a sphere around the center of mass and begin iterating , shrinking the sphere around the ( new ) center of mass until we reach a minimum of 50 particles .",
    "this ensures a correct identification of the center of mass taking into account gas and dark matter particles .",
    "once we have the final center of mass , we grow a sphere around it that encloses a value of @xmath36 .",
    "given that we want to study radio emission in the cosmic web , the nodes of the filaments will be consider as galaxy clusters with masses @xmath37m@xmath38 .",
    "we find that the marenostrum universe contains 3865 clusters of galaxies , the most massive with a mass of @xmath39m@xmath38 and virial radius @xmath40mpc .",
    "the characterization of the large - scale structure was done using the spineweb method ( for a thorough explanation see @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this method classifies the cosmic web into four basic morphological and dynamical components : voids , walls , filaments and clusters .",
    "the spineweb method is based on the watershed transform @xcite and its cosmological implementation : the watershed void finder ( wvf ) @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the wvf is to segment the density field into individual basins by `` flooding '' it ( in analogy to a landscape ) .",
    "the spineweb method takes this analogy and goes one step further by directly relating the topology of the density field and the boundaries between basins by observing the simple relation between number of adjacent basins and topology : walls correspond to the boundary between two voids .",
    "filaments+clusters are found at the intersection of three or more voids , which translates to the intersection of three or more walls :    @xmath41    the resulting morphological characterization is parameter - free .",
    "the analysis presented here is also based on the most recent implementation of the spineweb method which extends the original formalism on a multiscale hierarchical fashion making it also scale - independent .    in practice",
    "we start our analysis by generating a low resolution version of the original simulation using the averaging procedure described in @xcite .",
    "the lower particle resolution was chosen to correspond to a inter - particle separation of approx .",
    "3@xmath26mpc at the initial conditions .",
    "with this `` linear - regime '' filtering we avoid small - scale substructure at the present time while keeping the characteristic large - scale anisotropy of the cosmic web . from the particle distribution",
    "we compute the density field using the dtfe method @xcite .",
    "the field is sampled at 27 different points inside each voxel and its mean is used to estimate the density for that particular voxel . from the density field",
    "we compute the watershed transform and identify the boundaries of the basins ( i.e. the watershed transform itself ) . finally for each voxel in the watershed",
    "we apply the criteria outlined in eqn .",
    "[ eq : neighbour_morphology ] .",
    "the complete procedure takes a few minutes on a regular workstation .",
    "the spineweb method provides a complete framework for the characterization of the cosmic web into its basic morphological constituents : voids , walls , filaments and clusters .",
    "it has no free parameters and being fundamentally a topological measure it is highly robust against noise in the density field .",
    "[ fig : spine ] shows an example of how the spineweb correctly identifies the different elements of the cosmic web . shown is a full 3d network of filaments ( red ) and walls ( blue ) .",
    "it is clearly visible the three - dimensional nature of the filament - wall network .",
    "filaments define an interconnected web and walls fill the spaces in between the filaments forming a closed `` watertight '' network of voids .",
    "in the formation of structures in the universe , the bulk velocity of the gas flow often exceeds the local sound speed . as a result ,",
    "the shock surface separates two regions : the _ upstream regime _ or pre - shock regime , and the _ downstream regime _ or post - shock regime .",
    "the plasma in the upstream regime moves with a velocity @xmath42 towards the shock front , while the downstream plasma departs with velocity @xmath43 .",
    "most of the incident kinetic energy flux is converted into thermal energy . as the plasma passes through the shock front , mass , momentum and energy fluxes",
    "are conserved , which is expressed in the rankine - hugoniot relations :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 denotes the mass density , @xmath46 is the pressure and @xmath47 is the specific internal energy , and the velocities are measured in the rest - frame of the shock surface .",
    "the strength of a shock is given by the mach numbers @xmath48 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the upstream sound speed which depends on the the specific internal energy by @xmath51 .",

    "[ eq : rankine - hugoniot ] and [ eq : machnumber ] , and assuming that the plasma obeys the polytropic relation , we can write for the mach number @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the compression and entropy ratios .",

    "the method we employ is the one proposed and used by @xcite . for a detailed description of the method",
    ", we refer to the mentioned paper . here",
    ", we will give the basic details .",
    "the first step consists of computing the entropy gradient , @xmath58 , for each sph particle .",
    "the entropy gradient gives the direction of the shock normal pointing into the downstream direction .",
    "we define an associated upstream and downstream position , @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes upstream or downstream , with the downstream position in the opposite direction , @xmath61 is the position of the sph particle @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the smoothing length of particle @xmath62 and @xmath64 denotes the shock normal , @xmath65 .",
    "the upstream and downstream velocity are computed , together with the internal energy and density , using the usual sph scheme .",
    "the upstream velocity is given by @xmath66 , and the same for the downstream velocity , but using the downstream position .",
    "@xmath67 is the velocity of the shock front in the rest - frame of the simulation .",
    "it is important to notice that the velocity field can also show perpendicular components .",
    "we compute these components in a similar way to the upstream and downstream velocities , @xmath68 , where the three vectors @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 form an orthonormal base .",
    "once this is done , for those particles that belong to a shock front we demand that the velocity has to be divergent in the direction of the shock normal , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "also , the velocity difference in the directions perpendicular to the shock normal have to be smaller than that parallel to the shock , i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "finally , to compute the mach number , there are two options : it is possible to use the entropy ratio @xmath74 ( @xmath75 is the entropy ) or use the ratio @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the sound speed in the upstream region ( see section  [ sec : hydroshocks ] ) . in order to have a conservative estimate for the mach number",
    ", the smaller value of these two options is used .",
    "in this section , we will briefly describe the radio emission model . for a complete description ,",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first assumption of the model is that radio emission is produced by electrons accelerated to ultra - relativistic speeds required for synchrotron and inverse compton radiation .",
    "these electrons are accelerated to a power - law distribution that is related to the mach number from diffusive shock acceleration theory . as for the magnetic field in the downstream region , it is assumed that , on average , simply obeys flux conservation to follow :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the number density in the downstream region .",
    "this is a simple assumption since a detailed model for the generation and evolution of magnetic fields is complex and beyond the scope of this paper ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent study on magnetic fields in the coma cluster ) .",
    "there are several indications that the magnetic eld intensity decreases going from the center to the periphery of a cluster .",
    "the exact power with which it varies with density is unclear , however .",
    "some simulations suggest a higher power than that given by flux conservation which is attributed to the work of a fluctuation dynamo ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "faraday rotation measurements in the coma cluster @xcite give a best fit for @xmath82 .",
    "such a power would decrease the luminosity of cluster shocks by about 20% . outside of clusters",
    "there are even fewer observational constraints .",
    "recent constraints from tev @xmath83-ray sources have placed lower limits on extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmfs ) .",
    "the charged particles from pair cascades are deflected by egmfs , thereby reducing the observed point - like flux .",
    "dolag et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have calculated the fluence of 1es 0229 + 200 as seen by fermi - lat for different egmf .",
    "the non - observation of 1es 0229 + 200 by fermi - lat suggests that the egmf fills at least 60% of space with fields stronger than @xmath84 g assuming that the source is stable for at least @xmath85 yr . the fields outside clusters , however , will have a negligible effect on the radio luminosity function since the by far the largest part of the radio luminosity originates from shocks in or near clusters .",
    "the radio emissivity , @xmath86 , which depends on three quantities : i ) the energy of the electron energy ( @xmath87 ) , ii ) the observing frequency ( @xmath88 ) , and iii ) the magnetic field strength ( @xmath89 ) , is then given by :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the electron density , @xmath92 is the fraction of energy dissipated by the electron at the shock front and @xmath93 is the compression ratio at the shock front .",
    "the radiation spectral index is related to the electron spectral index by @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 has a value of @xmath96 .",
    "this magnetic field is defined as the magnetic field corresponding to the energy density of the cmb .    as stated before , in order to calculate the radio emission , we need the mach number , @xmath48 , the downstream temperature , @xmath97 , the electron density , @xmath91 , the magnetic field , @xmath89 , and the shock surface area , @xmath98 .",
    "the shock finder described in sect .",
    "[ sec : shockfinder ] , besides locating shock discontinuities in a sph simulation , also provides estimates for the mach number and for the shock normal .",
    "this normal vector gives a position which is sufficiently downstream to determine @xmath97 and @xmath91 .",

    "convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , which produces a third function that is a modified version of the one of the original functions .",
    "usually , one of the two functions is taken to be a _ kernel _ function which acts on the other function , modifying it .",
    "the standard convolution states that @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the convolution operand .",
    "the inverse of this operation is called deconvolution . in our case , we have a measured distribution , namely @xmath125 , obtained from the simulation and we wish to obtain the _ real _ distribution , i.e. , the shock surface area distribution taking into account the particles that were assign a low mach number in strong shocks and the underestimation of the different mach numbers .",
    "therefore , we need to find the shock tube _ distribution kernel _ taken from the shock tubes data in order to deconvolve it with our measure function .",
    "however , instead of finding the inverse of the kernel function , we will iterate the convolution procedure , which will yield the real distribution .",
    "the convolution we want to solve is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the _ measured _ shock surface distribution , @xmath128 is the kernel function and @xmath129 is the _ real _ distribution we want to find . in eqn .",
    "[ eq : our_convolution ] we have taken two things into account :",
    "i ) there are not negative mach numbers , and ii ) the kernel function depends on the mach number .",
    "in section  [ sec : shocktubes ] we saw that a simple representation to the shock surface area of the shock tubes are a heaviside function and a gaussian .",
    "therefore , our kernel has the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a gaussian with form @xmath132 where the standard deviation also depends on the measured mach numbers , i.e. , @xmath133 as seen in the previous section .    after constructing the kernel with the fitting parameters of the various shock tubes , we give a guess function in order to start the iteration procedure . as a first guess , we choose @xmath134 , and convolve that with the kernel , giving as a result @xmath135 .",
    "the new guess is then calculated by subtracting the previous guess with the difference between the result of the convolution of the first guess with the measured function , i.e. , @xmath136 .",
    "we found that after iterating 5 times we are able to recover @xmath137 ."
