    "doped or defective titanium dioxide ( tio@xmath2 ) exhibits rich physical phenomena in electronic transports and optical properties@xcite .",
    "tio@xmath2 is opaque in the visible sun light whereas it is very efficient in absorbing ultraviolet ( uv ) light rendering it interesting especially for photocatalysis applications @xcite .",
    "the first step of photoexcitation is the formation of electron - hole pair quasiparticles ( excitons ) , which may either recombine or decay into free charges .",
    "eventually the free charges react with molecules on the surface enhancing photocatalytic effects and formation of reactive free radicals @xcite .",
    "excitons , and their spatial behaviour , play therefore a key role for both fundamental physics as well as for applications , but the precise nature and behaviour of excitons in tio@xmath2 based materials remains unclear in some respects .    the many - body electron - electron ( e - e ) and electron - hole ( e - h ) interactions determine the physical properties of excitons , with different contributions depending on the system and on the considered energy range",
    ". excitons usually occur below direct bandgap in semiconductor and insulator materials , but they may involve higher energy bands in the case of strong electronic correlation . with the recent development of supercomputing and _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite , theoretical studies have shown that when both e - e and e - h interactions are strongly coupled , they yield to a new type of optical phenomenon , the so - called high - energy resonant excitonic effect .",
    "in fact , resonant excitons have been predicted @xcite and later observed @xcite in two - dimensional graphene . unlike excitons in conventional semiconductors , the resonant excitons can occur at energies even well above the corresponding optical band gap of the material , and they can be probed directly using high - energy optical conductivity @xcite",
    ". a detailed understanding of the role of e - e and e - h interactions in tio@xmath2 based materials remains elusive , and resonant excitons have not been observed in the material , mainly because both experimental and theoretical studies at high - energy optical conductivity are challenging and limited in number .",
    "we report in this paper on optical studies of tio@xmath0 doped at different concentrations of tantalum , via optical conductivity measurements and _ ab initio _ time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) calculations .",

    "a series of unusual phenomena arise , in particular the spectral - weight transfer from high towards low energies , and the emergence of an intense resonant exciton at @xmath6 ev .",
    "based on our theoretical calculations , we relate these effects to a peculiar manifestation of strong e - e and e - h interactions . the paper is organized as follows : in section [ matmet ] , experimental and theoretical - computational used techniques are described . in section [ seciii ] , optical spectra , both measured and calculated , are described . in section [ conclusions ] , the main conclusions are drawn .",

    "the measurements were performed in ultra - high vacuum environment ( chamber pressure of @xmath14 mbar ) at room temperature . before these measurements , the samples were heated up to @xmath15 k in ultra - high vacuum to ensure that there were no additional adsorbate layers on the surface of the samples .",
    "the obtained uv - vuv reflectivity data were calibrated by comparing it with the luminescence yield of sodium salicylate ( nac@xmath16h@xmath17o@xmath18 ) and the gold mesh current .",

    "the e2 at  6.0 ev peak shows further enhanced intensity , without any significant change in the remaining structures with respect to lower ta - concentration . to summarize , we have , upon ta - doping : ( i ) an anomalous spectral - weight transfer from energies as high as 35 ev towards the 6 ev region ; ( ii ) the emergence of a novel resonant exciton e2 at  6 ev ; and ( iii ) the strong modification of tio@xmath2 optical conductivity , with an augmented optical bandgap . the optical conductivity",

    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) , we show the optical conductivity of the pure tio@xmath2 calculated using the three above mentioned theoretical methods . the gw - bse calculations , taking into account both the e - e and e - h interactions , give rise to bound and resonant excitons or other excitonic effects along with spectral - weight transfers .",
    "the comparison between the gw - bse and gw - rpa results gives therefore a direct measure of the excitonic nature of a resonance .",
    "the gw - rpa calculation fails in reproducing the p2 bulk resonance and the structures near the absorption edges , while both gw - bse and jgm - tddft , with some differences in their detail , are able to describe the p1 and p2 peaks .",
    "this confirms that the e - e and e - h interactions are significant and important , not only for doped anatase , but even for pure tio@xmath2 , in agreement with previous results @xcite .",

    "the solution of the gw - bse becomes computationally cumbersome .",
    "we turn therefore to jgm - tddft , which is equally reliable , as just shown in the case of pure tio@xmath2 , but computationally feasible also for large supercells .",
    "we focus on optical features in the region of the @xmath296.0 ev , and we use tddft to qualitatively study the relationship between e@xmath32 ( and therefore the screening properties of the material ) , and resonant excitonic effects in ta@xmath4 ti@xmath5o@xmath2 . in fig .",

    "the strong correlation mimicked by e@xmath32 is reflected in the optical response , in particular in the behaviour of the peak at 6.0 ev .",
    "peak p2 undergoes a redshift of almost 1  ev , and at the same time its intensity increases .",

    "[ fig5]-b ) , the theoretical calculations qualitatively suggest that peak p2 is evolving in the e2 exciton at 6.0 ev whereas the p3 peak at @xmath296.1 ev is transforming in the shoulder e3 at 6.8 ev ( fig [ fig5](b ) ) .",
    "this seems to be counter - intuitive looking at only the experimental optical conductivity results for pure and ta - substituted tio@xmath2 , but becomes clear when the proper alignment and assignment of optical features are performed .",

    "our jgm - tddft calculations display an interplay between e@xmath32 and the resonant excitons , i.e. larger e@xmath32 reflects in an enhancement of the resonant excitonic effects .",
    "furthermore , the jgm - tddft calculations support the following scenario : the resonant exciton e2 at @xmath296 ev in experimental spectra can be related to a modification of the electronic structure under ta - substitution , leading also to the opening of the bandgap .",
    "this result is in contrast to a conventional picture , where ta - substitution would lead to a simple electron doping and metallization of tio@xmath2 .",
    "in fact , our findings imply that ta - substitution in ta@xmath4 ti@xmath5o@xmath2 does not act as a conventional dopant , but plays instead an unusual role in enhancing strong electronic correlations .",
    "a behavior partaking some similarities with these results has been recently reported for a magnetic - doped tio@xmath2 system .",

    "we observe some analogies between our ta - doped semiconductor spectra , and the optical behaviour of undoped mott insulators ( as cuprates ) , where intense optical absorption in the duv are due to transitions from the lower to the upper hubbard band . in the case of mott - insulators , the change of e@xmath32 ( or the mott - gap @xcite ) as function of doping gives a signature of the e - e correlation . by using the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )",
    ", it has been shown that different percentages of doping enable a change of phase .",
    "the increase of d - states modifies their electronic density of states ( dos ) , and the pseudo - gap material becomes insulating .",
    "this results in a strong enhancement of peaks intensity in the optical conductivity .",
    "a similar behavior may be revealed in the present case where the inclusion of ta d- and f- orbitals seems to have a role in changing the tio@xmath2 physics increasing both e - e and e - h correlations .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented the emergence of an intense resonant exciton induced by ta - substitution in anatase tio@xmath2 .",
    "this result is of primarily importance for possible industrial applications .",
    "we argue that in these experimental findings tunable e - e and e - h correlations play a key role in the observed resonant excitons in ta@xmath4 ti@xmath5o@xmath2 system , and can be used in a model for resonant excitonic effects .",

    "<S> titanium dioxide ( tio@xmath0 ) has rich physical properties with potential implications in both fundamental physics and new applications . up - to - date , the main focus of applied research is to tune its optical properties , which is usually done via doping and/or nano - engineering . </S>",
    "<S> however , understanding the role of @xmath1-electrons in materials and possible functionalization of @xmath1-electron properties are still major challenges . </S>",
    "<S> herewith , within a combination of an innovative experimental technique , high energy optical conductivity , and of the state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations , we report an emerging , novel resonant exciton in the deep ultraviolet region of the optical response . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant exciton evolves upon low concentration ta - substitution in anatase tio@xmath2 films . </S>",
    "<S> it is surprisingly robust and related to strong electron - electron and electron - hole interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1- and @xmath3- orbitals localization , due to ta - substitution , plays an unexpected role , activating strong electronic correlations and dominating the optical response under photoexcitation . </S>",
    "<S> our results shed light on a new optical phenomenon in anatase tio@xmath2 films and on the possibility of tuning electronic properties by ta substitution . </S>"
