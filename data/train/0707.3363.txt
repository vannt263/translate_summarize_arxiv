    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) form a restricted family of neutron star ( ns ) x - ray sources with properties quite different from those of other known classes of x - ray emitting nss , in particular the radio pulsars . however , in the last few years evidence gathered of a possible link between axps and another peculiar class of nss : the soft gamma  ray repeaters ( sgrs ; see woods & thompson 2006 for a recent review ) .",
    "the nature of the strong x - ray emission from axps and sgrs is intriguing .",
    "in fact , their x - ray luminosity is too high to be powered by the loss of the star rotational energy alone , as in the more common radio pulsars . at the same time",
    ", the lack of observational signatures of a companion strongly argues against an accretion powered binary system , favouring instead scenarios involving isolated nss .",
    "[ fig : powspec ]    axps are usually radio - quiet and exhibit x - ray pulsations with spin periods in the @xmath112s range .",
    "this , along with their large spin - down rates ( @xmath2ss@xmath3 , implies magnetic fields exceeding the ( electron ) critical magnetic field , @xmath4  g , if spin - down occurs mainly through magneto - dipolar braking .",
    "furthermore , they are characterised by a high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) . their high - energy emission ( @xmath7100 kev )",
    "is traditionally modelled by an absorbed blackbody ( @xmath8kev ) and two power",
    " laws ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , although recently several attempts have been made to apply more physical spectral models ( e.g. perna et al . 2001 ; rea et al .  2007a , b , c ) .",
    "at present the model which appears most successful in explaining the peculiar observational properties of axps and sgrs is the `` magnetar '' model . in this scenario axps and sgrs",
    "are thought to be isolated nss endowed with ultra - high magnetic fields ( @xmath11 g ) the decay of which powers their x - ray emission ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1993 , 1995 , 1996 ) . at magnetic fields higher than @xmath12 , radio emission",
    "is believed to be suppressed e.g. by the photon  splitting process ( baring & harding 1998 ) , and this could explain why magnetars were believed not to show any radio emission .",
    "however , the discovery of radio pulsars with magnetic fields higher than the electron critical field ( camilo et al .",
    "2000 ) and with very weak x  ray emission , as well as the discovery of radio pulsations from one magnetar ( camilo et al .",
    "2006 ) , is puzzling and still awaits explanation .",
    "alternative scenarios , invoking accretion from a fossil disk , remnant of the supernova explosion ( van paradijs , taam & van den heuvel 1995 ; chatterjee , hernquist & narayan 2000 ; perna et al .",
    "2000 ; alpar 2001 ) , encounter increasing difficulties in explaining the data .    is one of the brightest axps known to date , and it was first detected by _",
    "uhuru _ in 1978 ( forman et al . 1978 ) .",
    "however , mainly because of the presence of the accretion - powered binary pulsar rx j0146.9 + 6121 nearby , only in 1994 was an @xmath13s periodicity reported using exosat data taken in 1984 ( israel , mereghetti & stella  1994 ) .",
    "long term spin period variations were discovered thanks to a large _ r_xte campaign ( gavriil & kaspi 2002 ) , leading to the measure of the period derivative @xmath14ss@xmath15 . despite deep searches ( israel , mereghetti & stella 1994 , wilson et al .",
    "1999 ) , no evidence for orbital motion has been found , supporting the isolated ns scenario .",
    "subsequent observations ( white et al .",
    "1996 ; israel et al .",
    "1999 ; paul et al .",
    "2000 ) revealed a soft ( 110kev ) x  ray spectrum typical of an axp , best fitted by an absorbed blackbody ( @xmath16kev ) plus a power law ( @xmath17 ) .",

    "we report on two new _ xmm ",
    "_ observations of the axp performed in march and july 2004 .",
    "these observations provide by far the most accurate data collected in the soft x - ray band for this source .",

    "these two very deep observations have been performed on march 1st and july 25th 2004 , with on  source exposure times of 46 and 23ks , respectively ( see the end of this section for further details on the first two short observations ) .",
    "the _ xmm  newton",
    "_ observatory ( jansen et al . 2001 ) includes three 1500  @xmath20 x - ray telescopes with an epic instrument in each focus , a reflecting grating spectrometer ( rgs ; den herder et al .",
    "2001 ) and an optical monitor ( mason et al .",
    "two of the epic imaging spectrometers use mos ccds ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ) and one uses a pn ccd ( strder et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "data have been processed using sas version 7.0.0 , and we have employed the most updated calibration files ( ccf ) available at the time the reduction was performed ( november 2006 ) .",
    "standard data screening criteria are applied in the extraction of scientific products .",
    "we have cleaned the march 2004 observation for solar flares ( the observation in july is not affected ) ; the exposure time after the solar flare filtering is 37ks .",
    "both 2004 observations have the same instrument set  up . pn and",
    "mos1 cameras are used with the medium filters , while the thick filter is applied for the mos2 camera .",
    "the pn camera is set in timing mode in order to avoid pile  up , the mos1 with the central ccd in timing mode , and the others in prime full window mode .",
    "the mos2 ccds are all set in prime full window mode , with the aim of unveiling possible transient x  ray sources which might contaminate the instruments observing in timing mode .",
    "no transients are present in the mos2 image .",
    "the source is , as expected , highly affected by pile  up .",
    "hence , we do not consider the mos2 data any further .    in order to extract more than 90% of the source counts ,",
    "we have constructed , for the data obtained with the pn and the mos1 central ccd , a one  dimensional image and we fit a gaussian to the 1d photon distribution .",
    "we have then extracted the source photons from a rectangular region with rawx and rawy coordinates 37,100.75 and 18,197.5 .",
    "the background is obtained from a rectangular region of the same size , as far as possible from the source , on the east side . only photons with pattern@xmath21",
    "are used for the pn and with pattern@xmath22 for the mos1 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the x  ray spectrum has been discovered to have a hard x  ray component ( kuiper et al .  2006 ; den  hartog et al .",
    "rea et al . ( 2007a ) applied several models to the 0.5250kev spectrum in order to model the emission of this source across this large energy range , using simultaneous observations performed in july 2005 with _",

    "( 2007a ) , these observations are not simultaneous . however , the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum shows only a very modest variability between the _ swift  xrt _ observation performed in july 2005 ( simultaneous to the _ integral _ observation we use here ) and the _ xmm  newton _ observations we report here .",
    "we then tentatively rely on the stability of the hard x  ray spectrum and try to fit the overall spectrum assuming that the source is in the same emission state during both the _ xmm  newton _ and the _ integral _ observations .",
    "we fit the 1250kev spectrum with : one absorbed blackbody plus two power ",
    "laws , an absorbed resonant cyclotron scattering model plus a power  law and two absorbed log  parabolae ( tab.3 ; see rea et al .",
    "2007a for further details on these models ) .",
    "we find that all these models , remove the excess in the @xmath658kev residuals ( not significant though ) found in the _ xmm  newton _ spectrum when fitted with an absorbed blackbody plus a single power  law ( see fig.[fig : spectra ] and tab.1 ) .",
    "we then conclude that this excess in the residuals is indeed due to the presence of the hard x - ray component .",
    "furthermore , the spectral parameters we find for the three best fit models are consistent ( within 3@xmath66 statistical accuracy ) with those reported by rea et al .",
    "( 2007a ) using the _ swift  xrt _ spectrum , with lower statistics and smaller energy coverage .",
    "we note that the constant parameter in the fitting of the two log  parabolae is slightly smaller than the range of values that the cross  calibration between _",
    "xmm  newton _ and",
    "_ integral _ should take .",
    "this might be either a hint of the fact that the second log ",
    "parabola can barely take into account the 810kev part of the spectrum which was missing in the _ swift  xrt _ spectrum , or simply a statistical fluctuation . a simultaneous observation of with _ xmm  newton _ and a longer",
    "_ integral _ exposure might shed light on this issue .",
    "we reported here on the timing and spectral analysis of four _ xmm ",
    "newton _ observations of the axp performed from 2002 to 2004 , representing the deepest x  ray observations on this source performed to date .",
    "the pulse profile of 4u 0142 + 614 is double peaked in the soft x ",
    "rays , and largely variable as a function of energy ; we also detect an increase with energy of the fundamental pulsed fraction component ( see also hints for this increase in israel et al .  1999 ; paul et al .",
    "2000 ; ghler et al .  2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , ten years of rxte monitoring also revealed the pulse profile to be very variable in time , possibly related to the presence of glitches ( dib et al .  2007 ; but see also morii et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the presence of two distinct peaks in the phase profile of suggests that the emission might be concentrated in two regions on the star surface .",
    "since the two maxima are offset by half a phase cycle , the emission regions must be located antipodally on the surface of the star . in a `` standard '' cooling ns",
    ", such a geometry of the emission regions would be naturally produced by a ( core - centred ) dipolar magnetic field .",
    "in fact , since heat flows preferentially along the magnetic field lines , in this scenario the polar regions ( where the field lines are more closely packed ) turn out to be hotter than the equatorial belt . on the other hand , for such configurations , the pulsed fractions are low , the more when gravity effects are accounted for ( e.g. page 1995 ; perna , heyl & hernquist 2000 ; dedeo , psaltis & narayan 2001 ) .",
    "the very high pulsed fraction of the hard ( @xmath67  kev ; kuiper et al .",
    "2006 ; den  hartog et al .",
    "2007 ) , photons may be explained if they are produced in regions high up in the magnetosphere , where no relativistic effects are expected to wash out the pulsed emission .",
    "this might also tentatively explain the increase of the pulsed fraction with energy , in particular between the band dominated by the thermal component , and that dominated by the power  law .",
    "however , much more detailed theoretical models are need to fully interpret this phenomenon .",
    "in fact , it is unlikely that magnetars are passive coolers in which the surface temperature distribution is solely determined by the large - scale field topology . as stressed by thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni ( 2002 ) , portions of the star surface",
    "are heated by the returning currents which flow into a `` twisted '' magnetosphere , and this may be a possible explanation for the presence of hotter regions on the star surface . it has been recently suggested ( thompson , lyutikov & kulkarni 2002 ; lyutikov & gavriil 2005 ; fernandez & thompson 2007 ) that the mechanism responsible for the formation of the 0.110  kev spectrum of axps and sgrs is cyclotron resonant up - scattering of soft ( @xmath7  kev ) thermal photons produced at the star surface by electrons ( or pairs ) which fill the ( twisted ) magnetosphere .",
    "currents are mainly concentrated towards the magnetic equator , and this , as the monte carlo simulations of fernandez & thompson ( 2007 ) show , makes the emission pulsed even if primary thermal photons are produced uniformly at the star surface .",
    "we performed some preliminary calculations with a monte carlo code ( nobili et al . in preparation ) in order to check if the increase of the pulsed fraction with energy is qualitatively reproduced by the resonant scattering model .",
    "for instance , assuming that the star is an orthogonal rotator seen at an angle @xmath68 with respect to the rotation axis , we find that the low energy ( 0.52 kev ) light - curve should be double peaked while , at higher energies ( 7 - 10 kev ) , the secondary peak tends to disappear and the pulsed fraction increases .    at variance with what has been recently found for a few other axps ( e.g. , and ; rea et al .",
    "2005 ; mereghetti et al .",
    "2004 , and woods et al .",
    "2004 ) , these very deep x  ray observations of the axp find the source stable in flux and spectral shape .",
    "however , spectral and flux variability are expected to be connected with the axp bursting activity , as e.g. detected for ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ; woods et al .",
    "hence , the recent bursting activity of ( kaspi et al .  2007 ; gavriil et al .",
    "2007 ) should have probably disturbed its steady emission state , and the source might have recently enhanced its flux and hardened its spectral shape .    furthermore , we put very strong upper limits on the presence of x  ray lines in the spectrum of this axp , either of resonant cyclotron or atmospheric nature , the deepest upper limits for an axp to date .",
    "this is a further confirmation that the x - ray spectral lines , possible due to proton cyclotron scattering , or to absorption by the ns atmosphere , are either very weak , or not present at all ( e.g. suppressed by qcd processes ; ho & lai 2003 ; van adelsberg & lai 2006 ) in the spectra of axps , and probably also of sgrs .",
