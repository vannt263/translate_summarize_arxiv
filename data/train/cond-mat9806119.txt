    "how ( and whether ) coherent quasiparticles form in a lightly doped mott insulator is a key question in the physics of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "a satisfactory theoretical understanding of this issue has been achieved in the limit where magnetic correlations do not play a prominent role , starting with the work of brinkman and rice @xcite . in cuprate superconductors however , the undoped phase is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a rather large exchange coupling @xmath17 ( on the scale of @xmath18 ) , so that we have to face the problem of the interplay between local coherence and magnetic correlations .",
    "furthermore , there is ample experimental evidence that _ carrier localisation _ and _ magnetic frustration _ also play a crucial role in the low to intermediate doping regime .",
    "this is particularly clear in the  compound at concentrations just above @xmath19 ( the threshold for the disappearance of the antiferromagnetic long - range order ) , for which true spin - glass ordering of the copper moments has been demonstrated at very low temperature ( with @xmath20 for @xmath21 @xcite ) .",
    "up to which doping concentration does this glassy regime persist when superconductivity is suppressed is not known at this point , but carrier localization is indeed observed at low temperature up to optimal doping in both the @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions when a strong magnetic field is applied @xcite .",
    "it was actually predicted early on @xcite that hole doping induces strong frustration in the system when the holes become localized , replacing locally an antiferromagnetic cu - cu bond with an effectively _ ferromagnetic _ one , with a strength larger than the original @xmath17 .",
    "we observe furthermore that the disappearance of antiferromagnetic long - range order is accompanied by the appearance of new low - energy spin excitations , of a quite different nature than spin waves , as evidenced by inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the compounds with a glassy ground - state display , at sufficiently high temperature ( above the onset of localization ) , the same distinctive transport properties as in samples with higher doping , e.g. linear resistivity @xcite .",
    "it is thus tempting to view these low - energy excitations as the source of anomalous scattering in the normal state .",
    "anticipating some of the speculations made at the end of this paper , we shall argue that these low energy excitations are associated with a novel kind of spin state : the `` slushy '' state associated with the disordering of an insulating ( possibly glassy ) ground state by hole motion , quantum fluctuations and thermal effects . in this picture , many distinctive `` anomalous '' properties of the normal state of the cuprate superconductors are associated with the quantum critical regime corresponding to the @xmath24 transition at which the insulating ( glassy ) ground - state melts into a metallic ( fermi - liquid ) ground state",
    "when doping is increased .    in this paper , we shall study a highly simplified model of such a slushy state of spins and holes .",
    "our starting point is the work of sachdev and ye @xcite , who showed that in the large-@xmath25 limit of the fully - connected random heisenberg model of @xmath26 spins , quantum fluctuations are strong enough to overcome the tendency to spin - glass ordering . instead",
    ", a gapless spin - liquid state is found down to zero temperature with a large density of low - energy spin excitations @xcite .",
    "remarkably , these excitations are characterized by a local dynamic spin susceptibility which has precisely the form advocated by the `` marginal fermi liquid '' phenomenological description @xcite of the low energy spin excitations in cuprates , namely : @xmath27 this model is one of the few cases in which a response function having the marginal fermi liquid form could be derived explicitly ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the generalization of eq.([mflt=0 ] ) to finite temperature will be given in sec.[sectcrossovertherm ] ( eq .",
    "( [ mflchi ] ) ) and displays @xmath12 scaling . the physical mechanism for the gaplessness and the high - density of spin excitations in this model is discussed in more detail at the beginning of sec.[physics ] .",
    "it has to do with the large number of transverse components of the spins in the large-@xmath25 limit . in this respect",
    ", it might be a reasonable picture for the disordering of the two - dimensional quantum heisenberg spin - glass due to quantum fluctuations and low dimensionality @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to determine whether this marginal fermi liquid spectrum survives the introduction of charge carriers and the associated insulator to metal transition .",
    "the physics of this problem is dominated by the interplay between two competing effects :    * the formation of coherent metallic quasiparticles , which can be viewed as a binding of spin and charge degrees of freedom . in the simplest description of a doped mott insulator with @xmath28 , coherent quasiparticles form below a scale of order @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the doping and @xmath4 the hopping amplitude ) .",
    "this is a `` naive '' estimate of the effective fermi - energy scale , since it ignores any effect coming from the magnetic exchange ( which will tend to suppress it ) .",
    "* the binding of spin degrees of freedom on neighbouring sites into singlet or triplet states , and the corresponding slow dynamics of the on - site local moment .",
    "this is the phenomenon leading to the formation of the spin - liquid state in the undoped phase , which involves a scale of order @xmath3 ( the characteristic strength of the exchange ) .",
    "it is clear from comparing the scales above that when @xmath3 is larger than the `` naive '' coherence scale @xmath31 , the magnetic exchange prevents the formation of coherent quasiparticles at that scale : in other words , @xmath31 can not possibly be the _ actual quasiparticle coherence scale _ above which free local moments are recovered , since the exchange is still effective at energy scales between @xmath31 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is thus expected that the _ actual _ coherence scale of the system , @xmath32 will be much smaller than @xmath31 , and that a new metallic regime in which spin degrees of freedom form a spin - liquid like state while charge degrees of freedom are incoherent will be found in the intermediate energy and temperature range @xmath33 . from the above estimates , this will be the case at small doping : @xmath34 , while a direct crossover from a coherent metal to an incoherent high temperature state is expected for @xmath1 .",
    "these expectations are entirely borne out from our solution of the doped sachdev - ye model , as evidenced by fig.[crossovers ] , which summarizes the main crossovers found in our analysis .",
    "it should be emphasized that this competition between metallic coherence and magnetic exchange is also essential to the physics of heavy fermion compounds @xcite . in this context , the `` naive '' coherence scale @xmath31 stands for the single - impurity kondo scale ( or rather , any estimate of the lattice kondo scale that ignores rkky interactions ) , while @xmath3 stands for the typical strength of the rkky interaction .",
    "for this reason , the results of the present paper may also have some relevance , with appropriate changes , to the physics of the disordered rare - earth compounds near the quantum critical transition into a spin glass ground state @xcite .",
    "the effect of charge carriers on the sachdev - ye spin - liquid phase will be investigated by generalizing the model of ref .",
    "@xcite to a @xmath35 model , with randomness on the exchange couplings @xmath36 between nearest neighbors sites : @xmath37 in this expression , the @xmath38 spin symmetry of the electrons has been enlarged to @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "in this section , we study the nature of the metallic state as a function of the doping level @xmath30 .",
    "let us first recall some of the properties of the spin - liquid insulating state found for @xmath99 , as obtained by sachdev and ye @xcite . in this case ,",

    "these results display the above low - frequency behaviour ( but we note that significant corrections to ( [ mflchi ] ) are already sizeable at rather low values of @xmath109 . )",
    "hence the insulator at @xmath99 is a gapless quantum paramagnet ( spin liquid ) , with a rather large density of low - energy spin excitations .",
    "remarkably , ( [ mflchi ] ) is of the same form than the `` marginal fermi liquid '' susceptibility proposed on phenomenological grounds by varma _",
    "@xcite for the normal state of the cuprate superconductors . in the present context , the physical nature of these low - energy excitations is intimately connected to the fact that the exchange couplings @xmath36 are random in sign . in constructing the ground - state of the insulator ,",
    "let us imagine that we first try to satisfy the bonds with the larger exchange constants .",
    "when such a bond is antiferromagnetic , the two spins connected by it will form a non - degenerate singlet . for a ferromagnetic bond",
    "however , the two spins will pair into a state of maximal possible spin ( the generalization to @xmath26 of a triplet state ) .",
    "this state has a degeneracy , which actually becomes very large ( exponential in @xmath25 ) as @xmath25 becomes large . continuing the process in order to accommodate bonds with smaller strengths will tend to remove part of this degeneracy @xcite , but leaves behind a very large density of low - energy spin excitations .",
    "these effects are clearly favored by the ( fermionic ) large-@xmath25 limit considered here , because of the high degeneracies of the `` triplet '' state and because the strength of quantum fluctuations in this limit precludes the appearance of long - range order ( e.g. spin - glass ) which would remove degeneracies in a different manner .",
    "we believe however that this physics is not an _ artefact _ of the large@xmath110 limit . indeed , preliminary theoretical studies @xcite suggest that the local spin correlations near the quantum critical point associated with the @xmath24 transition into a metallic spin - glass phase could be similar to eq.([mflchi ] ) , with a related physics .    finally , we note that the single - site action to which the model reduces at zero doping ( _ i.e _ eq .",
    "( [ action2 ] ) with @xmath111 ) has some similarities with the multichannel kondo effect in the _ overscreened _ case . in the present context",
    "however , the `` bath '' seen by the spin is not due to an electronic conduction band , but generated by all the other spins in the lattice .",
    "the spin correlations of both the bath and the spin adjust to the self - consistent long - time behaviour : @xmath112 similar to that of the @xmath26 kondo model with @xmath113 channels @xcite ( 2-channel model in the @xmath38 case ) .",
    "the first question we would like to address is whether the `` marginal fermi liquid '' spin dynamics survives the introduction of charge carriers .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , this depends on the temperature range considered ( fig.[crossovers ] ) .",
    "at low temperature , below some -possibly very low- coherence scale @xmath114 , it turns out that a fermi liquid is recovered .",
    "this is easily seen from a low - frequency analysis of the integral equation for @xmath95 at zero - temperature . at zero doping ,",
    "the green s function and self - energy behave at low - frequency as : @xmath115 . when inserted in eq.([eqbase1 ] ) , this controls the leading low - frequency behaviour of both the r.h.s and l.h.s of the equation taken at @xmath99 , which match each other .",
    "however , for @xmath116 , the term @xmath117 would introduce a @xmath101 singularity and prevent this matching from taking place : this indicates that the low - frequency behaviour of the zero - temperature green s function for arbitrary small doping is no longer @xmath101 . in this respect ,",
    "an infinitesimal doping is a _ singular perturbation _ of the above equations .",
    "this observation directly yields an estimate of the coherence scale @xmath114 such that @xmath118 is recovered for @xmath119 .",

    "in this appendix , we explain the main steps that we followed in solving numerically the saddle point equations eqs.([eqbase ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the green s function is divided in two steps .",

    "convolutions are calculated using a fft algorithm and a simple iteration is used : starting from a given @xmath477 , a self - energy is obtained which is then reinjected into the expression for @xmath477 until a converged set @xmath478 is reached ( for given values of @xmath479 ) . a second routine uses the previous one to adjust @xmath480 and @xmath481 in order ( [ eqbase3],[eqbase4 ] ) to be satisfied .",

    "we consider a _",
    "finite - temperature _ generalisation of the green s function with the feynman prescription : @xmath482 which reduces to the usual green s function @xmath483 at @xmath24 .",
    "we now define : @xmath484 where @xmath4 is the real time . expressing both @xmath485 and @xmath486 as integrals of the spectral density with the spectral representation of @xmath487 ,",

    "note the change of the sign in front of @xmath493 .",
    "this form was used in ( [ equationgf ] ) . from ( [ eqbasetnul ] )",
    "one can write an algorithm for the computation of @xmath155 in the @xmath24 formalism , similar to the computation in imaginary time .",
    "of course , as our large-@xmath25 limit performs a resummation of the perturbation theory , one can also obtain these equations with the diagrammatic rules , but these rules do not apply at finite temperature to the green s function @xmath477 in a systematic manner .    a finite temperature , we use the following iterative algorithm : starting from @xmath487 , we get @xmath477 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath490 by direct convolution in real time and the second term of the r.h.s of ( [ relfondnum ] ) by a double convolution of @xmath494 .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath486 and go back to @xmath487 with eq .",
    "( [ eqbase ] ) .    as a starting point of the iteration , in order to speed up convergence , we take an analytic continuation of the solution in imaginary time , obtained by a standard pade approximation . note that the parameter @xmath92 and @xmath481 are fixed in this iteration on the real axis , since they have been calculated before in the matsubara formalism .",
    "as soon as the green function has been obtained , some other quantities are straightforwardly calculated from the formula given in the text .",
    "in particular , @xmath290 is expressed as a convolution .",
    "however the computation of the uniform susceptibility @xmath495 ( considered in appendix [ susceptibilite ] ) is more involved : we solve eq.([suscepunif ] ) for @xmath496 by another iterative loop analogous to the previous ones .",
    "the scaling function describing the effect of the doping at @xmath24 , is computed from ( [ equationgf ] ) by an iterative algorithm similar to the previous ones .",
    "we also give some useful details on the numerical calculation of the frequency - dependent resistivity .",
    "there , it is very convenient to integrate analytically over @xmath497 in ( [ conducbase ] ) using ( [ defrhoc ] ) and the relation : @xmath498 we thus obtain ( the green function is the retarded one ) : @xmath499 \\frac{n_{f}(\\nu ) - n_{f}(\\nu + \\omega)}{\\omega}\\ ] ] for the dc - conductivity , eq.([conducreduit ] ) simplifies to : @xmath500 \\frac{1}{\\cosh ^{2 } \\frac{\\beta \\omega   } { 2}}\\ ] ] in both case the integrals are computed simply by transforming them into a riemann sum .",
    "in this appendix , some details about the thermal scaling analysis of section [ sectcrossovertherm ] in the spinfluid regime are provided .",
    "as explained in the text , in this regime @xmath7 disappears from the thermal scaling functions and thus the calculation can be performed in the undoped model @xmath501 . in this appendix",
    ", @xmath463 and @xmath502 will denote the thermal scaling function of these quantities .",
    "they satisfy the scaled saddle point equation @xmath503 .",
    "the calculation is very similar to the low temperature , low frequency analysis made in @xcite so we here just give the main steps of the analysis .",
    "we first check that the scaling behaviour ( [ gechelle ] ) in imaginary time solves the saddle point equation ( for @xmath501 ) using the fourier formulas ( which follows from @xcite 3.631 ) :    [ fourier ] @xmath504 @xmath505    where @xmath506 are the matsubara frequencies .",
    "one can then show that ( [ scalingformrho ] ) and ( [ scalingformsigma ] ) are the scaling function on the real axis using the following method .",
    "first we use @xmath507 and @xmath508 ( see formula 3.313.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we then deduce the full green function ( and thus @xmath502 ) by performing the hilbert transform of @xmath285 using ( [ fourier2 ] ) again and @xmath509 ( see formula 3.112.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly explain how to calculate the _ uniform susceptibility @xmath510 _ and analyse its behaviour at small temperature in the undoped model @xmath501 .",
    "the magnetic field is introduced in the @xmath26 hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) in the following way : @xmath511 this formula clearly reduces to the usual one for @xmath45 . here ,",
    "only color 1 and 2 are coupled to this field but note that this choice is not unique though convenient for our calculation ( more generally the magnetic field must be coupled to an element of a cartan subalgebra of su(m ) ) .",
    "the large @xmath204 and large @xmath25 limit computation is similar to the zero field one explained previously , although it is more involved .",
    "a simplification occurs in this double limit : due to the fact that only 2 colors over @xmath25 are coupled to @xmath512 , the green function @xmath513 for colors @xmath514 are solutions of the zero - field equations ( [ eqbase ] ) .",
    "moreover we find @xmath515 and @xmath516 where @xmath517 is given by :        ( @xmath92 , @xmath481 and @xmath520 are always determined by eqs.([eqbase ] ) ) .",
    "the magnetisation is given by @xmath521 .",
    "let us define @xmath496 by @xmath522 . from eq.([eqbase5],[eqbase6 ] ) , @xmath496 satisfies : @xmath523 with these notations , the uniform susceptibility is given by @xmath524",
    ".      in the undoped case , eq.([suscepunif ] ) reduces to @xmath525 and the susceptibility at @xmath24 is formally given by : @xmath526 from the low frequency behaviour eq.([lowombehavg ] ) we have @xmath527 .",
    "thus we have to investigate the low - frequency behaviour of @xmath528 . generalising the luttinger theorem ( as expressed by eq.([luttfinal ] ) ) for the colors 1 and 2 , we obtain ( at @xmath24 ) : @xmath529 in this equation , @xmath530 is given by : @xmath531 where @xmath532 is the number of particles of color 1 .",
    "hence we obtain : @xmath533 taking first the limit @xmath216 and then @xmath534 we obtain finally ( as @xmath535 is bounded by definition ) : @xmath536 thus the leading low - frequency singularity in @xmath496 cancels so from eq.([chitnulle ] ) we see that @xmath495 is smaller than @xmath537 at small temperature . strictly speaking we can not prove from the previous argument that @xmath495 reaches a finite value at zero temperature , but it is a very natural guess which is moreover very well supported by our numerical calculation as displayed in fig.[chiunif ] .      for reviews on the large-@xmath25 approach ,",
