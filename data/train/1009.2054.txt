    "complex network analysis provides a novel approach to examining how networked systems in nature are originated and evolving according to what basic principles , and moreover armed with such discovered principles , constructing efficient , robust as well as flexible man - made networked systems under different constraints . among all studies about complex networks ,",
    "structure analysis is the most fundamental , and the ability to discover and visualize the underlying structure of a real - world network in question will be greatly helpful for both topological and dynamic analysis applied to it @xcite .",
    "so far , scientists have uncovered a multitude of structural patterns ubiquitously existing in social , biological , ecological or technological networks ; they may be microscopic such as motifs @xcite , mesoscopic such as modularities@xcite or macroscopic such as small world @xcite and scale - free phenomena @xcite .",
    "these structural patterns observed at different granular levels may collectively unveil the secrets hidden in complex networked systems .",
    "all these works have greatly triggered the common interesting as well as boosted the progress of exploring complex networks in both scientific and engineering domains .",
    "however , the topological structure analysis of complex networks , even restricted to the mesoscopic level , remains one of the major challenges in network theory mainly because most of the real - world networks are usually resulted from a combination of heterogeneous mechanisms which may collaboratively shape their non - trivial structures .",
    "more specifically one can raise the following issues .",
    "above all , beyond modularity the most extensively studied at the mesoscopic level @xcite , a wide spectrum of structural patterns have been reported in the literature including bipartites or more generally multipartites @xcite , hubs , authorities and outliers @xcite , bow ties @xcite or others . moreover",
    ", these miscellaneous patterns may simultaneously coexist in the same networks , or they may even overlap with each other such as the overlaps between communities @xcite .",
    "[ lesmis ] shows an illustrative example , in which a social network encoding the co - appearances of 77 characters in the novel `` les miserables '' is visualized in terms of both network and matrix representations .",
    "one would observe two hubs and a number of outliers coexisting with four well - formed communities .",
    "the two hubs , corresponding to _",
    "valjean _ and _ javert _ , are the main characters of the novel , and their links are across all other clusters by connecting about 48% of the overall characters .",
    "it indicates that the two roles interacting with different characters in different chapters are the two main clues going through the whole story .",
    "four detected communities can be seen as four relatively independent social cliques . as an example , we go into details of group 4 that is almost separated from the rest of the network .",
    "interestingly , this small social clique consists of 4 parisian students tholomyes , listolier , fameuil and blacheville with their respective lovers fantine , dahlia , zephine and favourite .",
    "group 5 consists of 39 outliers , which connect to either two hubs or one of four communities by only a few links .",
    "correspondingly , these outliers are the supporting roles of this novel . besides this example",
    ", more complex structural patterns in real - world networks will be demonstrated and discussed in the rest of this article .",
    "secondly , such multiple structural patterns may be nested .",
    "that is , real - world networks can contain hierarchical organizations with heterogeneous patterns at different levels . in the literature , hierarchical structures are usually studied in a homogeneous way , in which patterns observed in each layer of hierarchies show homophily in terms of either fractal property @xcite or modularity in more general cases @xcite .",
    "a recent study reveals that the patterns demonstrated in each layer of a dendrogram can be assortative ( or modular ) or disassortative ( or bipartite ) @xcite .",
    "the ability to observe heterogeneous patterns at different levels brings new clues for understanding the dynamics of real - world complex networks .    due to the above two reasons , for an exploratory network about which one often knows little",
    ", it is very hard to know what specific structural patterns can be expected and then be obtained by what specific tools .",
    "biased results will be caused if an inappropriate tool is chosen ; even if we know something about it beforehand , it is still difficult for a tool exclusively designed for exploring very specific patterns , say modularity , to satisfactorily uncover a multiple of coexisting patterns possibly overlapped or even nested with each other ( we call them _ multiplex structures _ in this work ) from networks . to the best our knowledge ,",
    "there have been no studies in the literature being able to address both of the above issues . on the other hand ,",
    "human beings have the capability of simultaneously discovering multiplex and significant structural patterns for various objectives .",
    "it has been believed that this kind of capability is an important form of human cognitive and intelligent functions @xcite .    back to the matrix as shown in the fig .",
    "[ lesmis ] , one would observe an intuitive phenomenon : any significant pattern contained in the underlying structures of the network can be statistically highlighted by a group of homogenous individuals with identical or quite similar connectivity profiles .",
    "for instance , individuals from the same communities prefer to intensively interact with each other but rarely interact with the rest ; hubs would prefer to connect many individuals from different parts of the whole network , whereas all outliers tend to seldom play with others by emitting only a few connections . based on this naive observation , if one can group the majority of individuals into reasonable clusters according to their connectivity profiles , the coexisting structural patterns can be unveiled by further inferring the linkage among clusters . in this way ,",
    "the first issue listed above can be promisingly solved .",
    "the idea of grouping nodes into _ equivalent _ clusters in terms of their connection patterns is quite similar with the philosophy of the _ blockmodeling _ first proposed by lorrain and white @xcite , in which nodes with _ structural equivalence _ ( defined in terms of local neighborhood configurations ) or more generally _ regular equivalence _",
    "@xcite ( defined in terms of globally physical connections to all others ) or more softly _ stochastic equivalence _ @xcite ( defined in terms of linking probabilities between groups ) will be grouped into the same blocks .",
    "based on the same idea , a very related study has been proposed recently by newman and leicht , which first ( to our knowledge ) shows the motivation to detect unpredefined structural patterns from exploratory networks @xcite . from the perspective of machine leaning , their method can be seen as a version of naive bayes algorithm applied to networks , whose objective is to group nodes with similar connection features into a predefined number of clusters . although their work only shows the ability to determine whether an exploratory network is assortative or disassortative by manually analyzing the obtained clusters , it has provided one good proof supporting that the idea of grouping nodes into equivalent clusters can be an initial step of the whole process aiming to unveil multiplex structures from networks .    in this work , we will propose a novel model by introducing the concept of granularity into stochastic connection profiles in order to properly model multiplex structures , and then show how the task of recognizing multiplex structures can be reduced to a simplified version of the isomorphism subgraph matching problem . to test our ideas and strategies proposed here",
    ", different sources of networks have been analyzed .",
    "it is encouraging that our methods show a good performance , capable of uncovering multiplex structures from the tested networks in a fully automatic way .",
    "we will model the connection profiles of nodes in terms of probabilities instead of physical connectivity . in this way",
    ", it is expected not only to find out multiplex structures but also to provide an explicit probabilistic interpretation for these findings within the bayesian framework .",
    "we term such probabilities as _ couplings _ in that they are not just the mathematical measures subjectively defined for modeling or computing , but they do exist in many real - world systems , encoding different physical meanings such as social preferences in societies , predation habits in ecosystems , co - expression regularities in gene networks or co - occurrence likelihood of words in languages , which will be valuable to predict their situated systems .    here the notation of granularity should be interpreted in terms of the resolution and precision . on one hand , in our model",
    "we define two kinds of couplings with different resolutions , i.e. , _ node couplings _ and _ block couplings_. formally , we define _ node feedforward - coupling _ matrix @xmath0 and _ node feedback - coupling _",
    "matrix @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively denote the probabilities that node @xmath4 expects to couple with or to be coupled by node @xmath5 . in the cases of indirected networks we have @xmath6",
    "( see si for proofs ) .",
    "we assume nodes will independently couple with others regulated by such couplings .",
    "nodes with similar feedforward- as well as feedback- coupling distributions will be clustered into the same blocks . in terms of matrices , homogeneous feedforward- and",
    "feedback - couplings guarantee homogeneous row and column connection profiles , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , given the block number @xmath7 , we define _ block feedforward - coupling _ matrix @xmath8 and _ block feedback - coupling matrix _",
    "@xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively denote the probabilities that block @xmath12 expects to couple with or to be coupled by block @xmath13 .",
    "we will show later that block couplings can be inferred from node couplings and vice versa .",
    "node couplings with a fine granularity are used to model networks in order to capture their local information as much as possible ; while block couplings with a coarser granularity are used to define and recognize global structural patterns by intentionally neglecting trivial details . on the other hand , in the nested patterns , node couplings and block couplings in different hierarchies",
    "will have different precisions in order to properly abstract and construct hierarchical organizations . in our model ,",
    "the couplings on higher layers are the approximations of the related ones on the lower layers .",
    "therefore , as the layers moving from the bottom ( corresponding to the original networks ) to the top ( corresponding to the finally reduced networks ) of the nested organizations , the precision of node or block couplings will gradually degenerate .      the main steps of our strategies for detecting multiplex structures from networks can be stated as follows :",
    "1 ) simultaneously estimating all kinds of couplings mentioned above and clustering all nodes into nested blocks with a proposed granular blocking algorithm ; and 2 ) in each layer of the nested blocks , recognizing structural patterns by matching predefined isomorphism subgraphs from a reduced blocking model in which trivial couplings are neglected , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lesmis]d .",
    "multiplex structures can be defined in terms of blocks and their couplings .",
    "[ blocking ] shows a schematic illustration by means of some conceptual networks . by referring to them ,",
    "we give following definitions .",
    "a _ community _ is a self - coupled block .",
    "an _ authority _ is a self - coupled block which is coupled by a number of other blocks .",
    "a _ hub _ is a self - coupled block which couples with a number of other blocks .",
    "an _ outlier _ is a block without self - coupling which is coupled by a hub or couples with an authority .",
    "_ a bow - tie _ is a subgraph consisting of a block @xmath14 and two sets of blocks @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which satisfy with : 1 ) @xmath14 is coupled by and couples with the blocks of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ;",
    "2 ) the intersection of @xmath17 and @xmath18 is empty or @xmath19 ; and 3 ) there are no couplings between @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; a _ multipartite _ is a subgraph consisting of a set of blocks without self - couplings which reciprocally couple with each other . as a special case of multipartite , a _",
    "bipartite _ is a subgraph consisting of two blocks without self - loop couplings which unilaterally or bilaterally coupled with each other .",
    "a _ hierarchical organization _ is a set of nested blocks , in which block subgraphs in lower layers are directly or indirectly nested in the bigger blocks on higher layers .",
    "the above definitions imply that there may exist overlaps between different patterns in the sense that the same blocks can be simultaneously involved in a multitude of subgraphs .",
    "for example , a block which is determined as a community can be also a hub , a authority or the core of one bow tie .",
    "moreover , beyond the predefined patterns , users are allowed to define novel even more complex patterns by designing new subgraphs of blocks , which can be identified by matching their isomorphism counterparts from blocking models .",
    "let @xmath20 be a directed and binary network , where @xmath21 denotes the set of nodes and @xmath22 denotes the set of directed links .",
    "in the case of undirected network , we suppose there are two direct links between each pair of nodes .",

    "this markov - like process indicates that the new model to be selected for layer @xmath99 is only based on the information of the layer @xmath104 .",
    "so , for a given network , its hierarchical organization can be incrementally constructed as follows .",

    "next , we form @xmath107 by capsuling each cluster on the first layer as one block , and cluster these blocks into @xmath108 clusters by selecting an new model with a maximum @xmath109 , which forms the second layer .",
    "we repeat the same procedure until it converges ( the cluster number obtained keeps fixed ) . in this way",
    ", the number of layers of a hierarchical organization will be automatically determined .",
    "the above procedure can be seen as a semi - supervised learning process ; in the cases that the granularity is more than one , we have already known a priori that which nodes will be definitely within the same clusters . as the layer in the constructed hierarchy increases ,",
    "the homogeneity of the nodes within the same cluster in terms of their connection profiles keeps degenerating , and correspondingly more global patterns are allowed to be observed by tolerating such increasing diversities .",
    "based on the obtained blocks in the level @xmath110 of the hierarchy , all potential patterns hidden in the level @xmath99 can be revealed through an isomorphism subgraph matching procedure , whose input is the block feedforward - coupling matrix @xmath92 .",
    "first we construct a reduced blocking model by taking each block as one node , and for each pair of blocks @xmath111 and @xmath112 we insert a link from @xmath111 to @xmath112 if @xmath10 is above a threshold computed based on @xmath92 ( see si ) . then for each block , we pick up the matched isomorphism subgraphs it will be involved in , and put them into categorized reservoirs labeled by different patterns . during this procedure , the subgraph to be put into a reservoir will be discarded if it is a subgraph of an existing one , as illustrated by fig.[worldtrade]d .",
    "the discovered multiplex structures as well as their granular couplings can be used to understand some dynamics of networks . here",
    "we give one example to show how cash possibly flow through a world trade net .",
