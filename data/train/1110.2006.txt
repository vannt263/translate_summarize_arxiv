    "extreme black holes are central objects of study in the high - energy physics community ( see @xcite ) ; however , no results were previously known for the evolution of linear waves on extreme kerr . in this context , the fundamental aspect of extreme black holes is the degeneracy of the redshift effect on @xmath6 .",

    "the analogues of the instability results will be addressed in a subsequent paper .      to put our results into context",
    ", we briefly summarise previous mathematical work on the linear wave equation on black hole spacetimes .      work on the wave equation on black holes spacetimes began in 1957 for the schwarzschild case @xmath14 with the pioneering work of regge and wheeler @xcite , but the first complete quantitative result ( uniform boundedness ) was obtained only in 1989 by kay and wald @xcite . during the last decade , ",
    "@xmath15 estimates \" providing integrated local energy decay for schwarzschild were derived in @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite introduced a vector field estimate which captures in a stable manner the so - called _ redshift effect _ , which allowed the authors to obtain quantitative pointwise estimates on the horizon @xmath5 .",
    "refinements for schwarzschild were achieved in @xcite and @xcite . for results on the wave equation coupled with the einstein(-maxwell ) system under spherical symmetry",
    "see @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite and for an exhaustive list of references see @xcite .",
    "with schwarzschild understood , interest then shifted to the wave equation on kerr backgrounds .",
    "the first uniform boundedness result for general solutions of the wave equation on slowly rotating kerr ( @xmath16 ) spacetimes was proven in @xcite and decay results ( again for @xmath16 ) were derived in @xcite .",
    "decay results for general subextreme kerr spacetimes ( @xmath17 ) were proven for axisymmetric solutions @xmath4 in @xcite and for general solutions in @xcite .",
    "two new methods @xcite were presented recently for obtaining definitive decay estimates for the energy flux as well as pointwise decay given integrated local energy decay bounds . exponential decay for kerr - de sitter ( i.e.  kerr backgrounds with positive cosmological constant )",
    "was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the slowly rotating kerr - ads was treated in @xcite . for previous",
    "work on mode analysis of the wave equation see @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "the fundamentally new aspect of extreme black holes is the degeneracy of the redshift effect along the event horizon ( see section [ sec : theredshifteffect ] ) .",
    "this necessitates developing new methods , since the results available for subextreme black hole backgrounds exploit  in one way or another  this effect .",
    "the tools needed for understanding the properties of solutions to the wave equation on _ spherically symmetric _ extreme black holes were developed in @xcite , where both stability and instability results were shown for extreme reissner - nordstrm which satisfy the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "the extreme case corresponds to @xmath18 .",
    "see also @xcite ] .",
    "specifically , energy and pointwise decay is shown for @xmath4 , whereas * non - decay * ( and * blow - up * ) is shown for the transversal to @xmath5 ( higher ) derivative of @xmath4 .",
    "note that these instabilities are in sharp contrast with the subextreme case for which decay holds for all higher order derivatives of @xmath4 along @xmath5 .",
    "we remark that the techniques introduced in @xcite heavily exploit the spherical symmetry of the background spacetime and thus break down in the case of extreme kerr .",
    "this is then the subject of the present paper .      in the present paper ,",
    "we show stability results for axisymmetric solutions @xmath4 of the form suggested by the results of @xcite for extreme reissner - nordstrm .",
    "the instability results for extreme kerr will be provided in a subsequent paper .",
    "the killing vector field @xmath2 ( see section [ sec : geometryofextremekerr ] for details ) is spacelike in a region outside @xmath6 known as the _ ergoregion _ , and therefore , the energy flux corresponding to @xmath2 fails to be non - negative definite .",
    "this phenomenon is called _",
    "superradiance_. nonetheless , superradiance is completely absent for axisymmetric solutions @xmath4 to the wave equation : if @xmath4 is axisymmetric then the conserved energy flux corresponding to the killing field @xmath2 is non - negative definite , yielding an a priori bound .",
    "however , as in the schwarzschild case , this flux degenerates at the event horizon @xmath6 .",
    "see section [ sec : axisymmetryvssuperradiance ]",
    ".      having obtained a bound for the degenerate energy associated to @xmath2 , the first problem one would naturally try to address is that of the uniform boundedness of the _ non - degenerate _ energy flux corresponding to a _ globally timelike _ vector field @xmath3 .",
    "this non - degenerate energy agrees with the energy as measured from a `` local observer s '' point of view .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it was shown that , for a wide class of non - extreme black holes , the redshift on @xmath6 together with the degenerate estimate of section [ sec : conservationofdegenerateenergy ] suffices to yield such bounds without carrying out further analysis of dispersive properties .",
    "this method applies in particular to axisymmetric solutions on the general subextreme kerr ( see corollary 7.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the extreme case the degeneracy of the redshift ( see section [ sec : theredshifteffect ] ) makes understanding of dispersion of @xmath4 essential even for the problem of boundedness .",
    "see also the discussion of section 1.3 of @xcite .    turning thus to dispersion , one of the main obstructions is the so - called _ trapping effect_. indeed , in kerr spacetimes one can easily infer from a continuity argument the existence of a family of null geodesics which neither cross @xmath6 nor terminate at null infinity .",
    "such null geodesics are called trapped and they are seen by the high frequency limit of solutions to the wave equation . in schwarzschild ,",
    "all trapped null geodesics approach the hypersurface @xmath19 known as the _ photon sphere _ , and dispersion in such backgrounds was proven by employing energy currents associated to vector fields which vanish precisely on this hypersurface .    passing from schwarzschild to kerr for @xmath20 , the structure of trapped null geodesics",
    "becomes more complicated .",
    "indeed , in the case of @xmath20 , there are null geodesics with constant @xmath21 for an open range of boyer - lindquist @xmath21 values .",
    "in fact , alinhac @xcite explicitly showed that classical energy currents can not yield non - negative definite spacetime estimates for _ general _ solutions to the wave equation ( see , however , the discussion below for the axisymmetric case ) .",
    "independent recent works have overcome this difficulty based on the separability of the wave equation @xcite , the complete integrability of the geodesic flow and the use of pseudodifferential calculus @xcite and the existence of a non - trivial killing tensor @xcite .",
    "the equivalence , for ricci flat spacetimes , of these three geometric properties was shown in @xcite .",
    "we adapt the method used for the first time in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the main insight of @xcite is that , although the classical energy method can not be directly applied to a general solution for obtaining non - negative definite estimates , it could well be the case that the energy method can be used in a more sophisticated form to individual modes ; the separability of the wave equation , as is used in @xcite , provides the means for considering such modes ( see section [ sec : separabilityofthewaveequation ] ) .",
    "this approach , though having the disadvantage of taking the fourier transform , has the advantage that it allows for a clean way to deal with all frequency ranges emphasising the relevant geometric features , and in particular , it does not require `` fine - tunning '' parameters in the sense of previous delicate constructions for schwarzschild . however , application of the virial frequency - localised currents constructed in @xcite gives rise to error terms that can only be bounded using the redshift effect , and thus , they can not be readily adapted to extreme kerr .    in this paper ,",
    "we construct novel microlocal currents which allow us to completely decouple the integrated local energy decay from the redshift . in other words",
    ", we show that the 4-integral of an energy - type density ( which degenerates at @xmath6 ) is bounded by the conserved flux of the ` stationary ' killing field @xmath2 through @xmath1 ( see theorem [ t2 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorem ] ) .",
    "in fact , we show that it suffices to use this microlocalisation only in a spatially compact region located away from @xmath6 .",
    "note that in order to consider individual modes of a general solution , we need to take the fourier transform in time , and since , a priori , the solutions might not be @xmath22 , we need to cut off in time",
    ". the cut - off will create error terms that we control using auxilliary microlocal currents and the introduction of novel classical vector fields ( see section [ sec : fourierlocalisedestimates ] ) .    as remarked above ,",
    "trapping affects only the high frequency limit of @xmath4 .",
    "however , the situation is much more favourable for axisymmetric solutions @xmath4 to the wave equation . in this case , for the entire range @xmath8 , the behaviour of high frequencies is intimately tied with the structure of the trapped null geodesics which approach a _ unique _",
    "hypersurface @xmath23 , for a constant @xmath24 that depends only is the unique root of @xmath25 in the domain of outer communications . ] on @xmath26 .",
    "geometrically , this is reflected in the fact that trapped null geodesics orthogonal to the axial killing vector field @xmath27 must necessarily approach the hypersurface @xmath23 .",
    "for this reason , we refer to this hypersurface as the `` effective photon sphere '' .",
    "note that for extreme kerr , the effective photon sphere corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "the trapping can then be quantified from the fact that the integrated energy decay estimate degenerates on this hypersurface .",
    "the degeneracy is eliminated by commuting with @xmath2 ( for more details about the trapping on extreme kerr see the discussions in sections [ sec : propertiesofthepotentialv ] and [ sec : thetrappedfrequenciesmathcalf21 ] ) .    in view of the above discussion ,",
    "let us explicitly note that the obstruction uncovered by alinhac @xcite does not apply to the axisymmetric case , and thus one could in principle expect to derive integrated decay ( for @xmath8 ) using purely classical currents ; this remains , however , an open problem .",
    "nonetheless , the separability turns out to be extremely useful in view also of its systematic approach to low frequencies as discussed above .      using the above integrated local energy decay and a novel current which captures in a quantitative way the degenerate redshift close to @xmath6 ,",
    "we infer boundedness of the non - degenerate energy . at the same time , this yields the boundedness of the 4-integral of an energy - type density integrated over a neighbourhood of @xmath6 ( see theorem [ t1 ] ) .",
    "this integrated estimate , however , degenerates with respect to the transversal to @xmath6 derivative . this degeneracy is related to the _ trapping _ along @xmath6 and is a characteristic feature of degenerate horizons , first presented in @xcite .",
    "we obtain now decay of the degenerate energy ( see theorem [ t3 ] ) using ( a ) the integrated local energy decay and the uniform boundedness of energy , ( b ) an adaptation of the dafermos - rodnianski method @xcite and ( c ) the existence of an appropriate causal vector field @xmath29 .",
    "we note that in our case , the assumptions of the dafermos - rodnianski method are not strictly satisfied in view of the degeneracy at @xmath5 .",
    "an extension of this method which covers extreme black holes was presented in @xcite where a virial causal vector field @xmath29 was introduced .",
    "this vector field was used to derive a hierarchy of estimates in a neighbourhood of @xmath6 that parallel the hierarchy of @xcite near @xmath30 . in section [ sec : energydecay ] , we show that the analogue of @xmath29 can be constructed in extreme kerr , and we employ this vector field to prove energy decay .    to obtain pointwise estimates",
    ", one needs to derive estimates for non - degenerate higher order energies and then apply appropriate sobolev inequalities on @xmath31 .",
    "bounds on such higher order energies were first derived in @xcite by commuting with suitably chosen timelike vector fields ( essentially capturing the higher order redshift effect ) . in view , however , of the degeneracy of the redshift in extreme kerr , one can not commute with timelike vector fields on @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , the results of @xcite suggest that non - degenerate higher order energies on @xmath31 generically blow - up !    nonetheless , by an interpolation argument , we prove non - degenerate @xmath32 bounds for @xmath4 on the spheres @xmath33 .",
    "these can be used to derive non - degenerate bounds for higher order energies controlling the derivatives of @xmath4 which are tangential to @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , although commutation with the killing vector fields @xmath34 is not enough for controlling all derivatives tangential to the sphere , kerr possesses a third differential operator @xmath35 which commutes with @xmath36 , which unlike @xmath2 and @xmath27 , is of second order ( see section [ sec : thecarteroperatorandsymmetries ] ) .",
    "this operator can then be used to bound an elliptic operator on the spheres , and by a spherical sobolev embedding we infer the required pointwise results ( see theorems [ t4 ] , [ t5 ] ) .",
    "this technique was introduced by andersson and blue @xcite in the @xmath37 case and requires higher regularity than the method of @xcite described above . the fact that this loss of regularity is necessary in extreme kerr reveals another characteristic feature of extreme black holes .",
    "see section [ sec : pointwiseestimates ] .",
    "we shall briefly describe several additional issues concerning the non - axisymmetric case which are not present in the axisymmetric case considered in this paper .",
    "the main features which emerge in the non - axisymmetric case are the problems of superradiance ( see sections [ sec : conservationofdegenerateenergy ] , [ sec : axisymmetryvssuperradiance ] ) and the more complicated trapping .",
    "in particular , there are trapped null geodesics which never leave the ergoregion , and thus the previous two difficulties are in some sense coupled , at least in physical space . regarding the subextreme case ,",
    "one of the main insights of @xcite is that for all @xmath13 , the superradiant frequencies , where @xmath38 is the angular velocity of the event horizon ( for the definition of the frequencies @xmath39 see section [ sec : separabilityofthewaveequation ] ) . ]",
    "are not trapped ; thus these difficulties uncouple when viewed with respect to this microlocalisation . in the extreme case",
    ", however , the upper limit of the superradiant frequencies is in some sense marginally trapped .",
    "this may be related to the existence of `` essentially undamped '' quasinormal modes located in this frequency regime .",
    "heuristics based on the existence of such modes and numerical analysis of andersson and glampedakis @xcite suggest that solutions @xmath4 are subject to an ` instability ' which forces them to decay much more slowly .",
    "proving , however , mathematically this ` instability ' remains an open problem and we hope that the methods of the present paper in conjunction with those of @xcite will be useful towards this direction . we remark that since superradiance is absent in extreme reissner - nordstrm ( as in the case considered in the present paper ) , this ` instability ' is not present in such backgrounds .",
    "we end this introduction with a brief discussion of a related problem , namely the uniqueness of kerr black holes .",
    "the `` no - hair '' conjecture states that the domains of outer communication of smooth , stationary , four dimensional , vacuum , connected black hole solutions are isometrically diffeomorphic to those of the kerr family of black holes .",
    "it is a well - known result ( see @xcite ) that if the event horizon is _ non - degenerate _ and if the metric in the domain of outer communications is _ real analytic _ , then this conjecture holds .",
    "regarding the degenerate case , chruciel and nguyen @xcite showed that the domains of outer communication of analytic , stationary , electrovacuum spacetimes with connected , non - empty , rotating , degenerate future event horizons are isometrically diffeomorphic to the domain of outer communications of _ extreme _ kerr - newman black holes .",
    "the assumption of analyticity is quite restrictive since , a priori , there is no reason that general stationary solutions to the einstein - vacuum equations be analytic in the ergoregion .",
    "the program to remove the analyticity assumption was initiated in @xcite by ionescu and klainerman .",
    "subsequently , the authors of @xcite showed how to bypass the analyticity assumption in the case where the stationary vacuum spacetime is a small perturbation of a given _ subextreme _ kerr background .",
    "the works on removing the analyticity assumption require in a fundamental way the event horizons to be bifurcate , i.e.  the future event horizon @xmath6 and the past event horizon @xmath40 must intersect on a 2-surface @xmath41 homeomorphic to the sphere .",
    "indeed , the existence of this sphere is crucial in the arguments for the unique continuation and extension of the hawking killing vector field in a neighbourhood of the event horizon .",
    "moreover , ionescu and klainerman @xcite have very recently constructed local , stationary , vacuum extensions of a subextreme kerr solution in a future neighbourhood of a point @xmath42 ( with @xmath43 not on the bifurcation sphere ) which admit _ no _ extension of the associated hawking vector field , emphasising , in particular , the importance of the bifurcation sphere in the context of the uniqueness problem .",
    "recall that in extreme kerr there is no bifurcation sphere , and hence , the uniqueness of extreme kerr without analyticity may be a very challenging problem .",
    "for the convenience of the reader , we briefly recall the geometric features of extreme kerr that are relevant to the considerations of this paper . in section [ sec : themetric ] we introduce the metric in boyer - lindquist and eddington - finkelstein coordinates and then , in section [ sec : theblackholeregion ] , we define the differential structure of a manifold @xmath44 on which the metric with respect to the latter coordinates is regular . the wave equation will be considered in the region @xmath45 defined in section [ sec : theinitialhypersurfacesigma0 ] .",
    "the kerr metric with respect to the _ boyer - lindquist coordinates _",
    "@xmath46 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49 schwarzschild corresponds to the case @xmath50 , subextreme kerr to @xmath13 and extreme kerr to @xmath11 .",
    "note that the metric component @xmath51 is singular precisely at the points where @xmath52 . to overcome this coordinate singularity",
    "we introduce the following functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 such that @xmath55 in the _ ingoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates _",
    "@xmath56 the metric takes the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 for completeness , we include the computation for the inverse of the metric in @xmath59 coordinates : @xmath60      clearly , the metric expression does not break down at the points where @xmath52 , and in fact , it turns out ( see @xcite ) that this expression is regular even for @xmath61 . on the other hand ,",
    "the curvature would blow - up at @xmath62 , i.e.  the equatorial points of @xmath63 .",
    "this motivates the following definition of the underlying differential structure of the kerr spacetime .",

    "let also @xmath68 be a global coordinate system on @xmath69 .",
    "we define the differential structure of the manifold @xmath44 to be @xmath70 on this manifold , given now parameters @xmath8 , the expression defines a regular lorentzian metric .    from now on ,",
    "we restrict our attention to extreme kerr @xmath11 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the event horizon @xmath6 is defined by @xmath71 the _ black hole region _",
    "@xmath72 corresponds to @xmath73 it is characterised by the fact that observers in the black hole region can not send signals to observers located at points with @xmath74 .",
    "the exterior region @xmath75 given by @xmath76 is the so - called _ domain of outer communications_. this is precisely the region covered by the boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "note that we shall be interested in studying the solutions to the wave equation in the region @xmath77 .      a convenient graphic representation of the previously mentioned regions can be achieved using penrose diagrams ( for relevant definitions see @xcite ) .",
    "the penrose diagram of the extended region @xmath44 is     [ fig : ekerr2 ]    this diagram represents pictorially the following fact : with respect to suitable definitions for the asymptotic structure corresponding to future ( past ) null infinity @xmath30 @xmath78 , the region @xmath75 can be characterised by @xmath79 we will not rely on such constructions in this paper , but we will often depict spacetime regions in the above form .",
    "we denote by @xmath80 and @xmath81 the coordinate vector fields with respect to the system @xmath82",
