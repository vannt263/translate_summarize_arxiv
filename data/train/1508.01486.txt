    "a number of different coherent interference effects have been observed in cavity optomechanical systems , and more recently  @xcite , in piezoelectrically actuated cavity optomechanical systems  @xcite .",

    "the pump is detuned one mechanical resonance away from the optical cavity line - center and we monitor the probe transmission by looking at the coherent rf spectrum of the photodetected signal ( generated by the beating between the pump and the probe ) transmitted past the cavity .",
    "we assume that the system is sideband - resolved , so that only one of the sidebands produced by the phase modulator interacts with the cavity .",
    "our system is sufficiently close to the sideband - resolved regime ( @xmath152  ghz , @xmath153  ghz ) for this assumption to be largely valid . in the calculations presented in the main text ,",
    "the influence of both sidebands was included to model the system as closely as possible .    starting with a simple side - coupled waveguide cavity system ( assuming no optomechanical coupling )",
    ", an incident optical probe will show a characteristic lorentzian dip in its transmission spectrum corresponding to the optical cavity resonance ( shown in figure  [ fig : figure_emit_omit_cpt](a ) ) .",
    "if we now turn the optomechanical coupling on , when the frequency difference between the pump and the probe approaches the mechanical resonance frequency , their interference drives the mechanical motion of the cavity and scatters photons from the pump to the probe beam frequency .",
    "these additional probe photons can interfere either constructively or destructively ( depending on the pump detuning ) with the transmitted probe beam ( from the regular waveguide - cavity scenario ) and leads to the opening of a transparency window in the transmission spectrum ( figure  [ fig : figure_emit_omit_cpt](b ) ) , a process commonly referred to as optomechanically induced transparency ( omit )  @xcite .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the interference occurs in the optical domain and the mechanical mode is coherently driven ( has a non - zero displacement amplitude ) .        to observe omit , the optomechanical coupling rate @xmath1 has to be sufficiently strong so that the beating between the pump and probe can drive the mechanical motion with sufficient amplitude to scatter photons from the pump to the probe beam frequency . in systems with small @xmath1 , the mechanical motion can be coherently driven by a different mechanism ( usually by acoustic waves using the piezoelectric effect ) and as long as the rf signal driving the mechanics is derived from the same source as the signal driving the electro - optic phase modulator , the photons scattered by the resonator from the pump will be phase coherent with the probe photons and one can see the induced transparency effect ( figure  [ fig : figure_emit_omit_cpt](c ) ) .",
    "this has been referred to as electromechanically induced transparency or microwave - assisted transparency in the literature  @xcite . in effect",
    ", it is not different from omit , except the source driving the coherent mechanical motion is electrical rather than optical , and the character of the interference ( constructive , destructive , or fano - like ) is set by the relative phase between the electrical drive and optical probe .",
    "finally , in a system with both strong @xmath1 and electrical drive , as we have presented in this work , the mechanical resonator can be driven both optically ( due to the beating between pump and probe , like in omit ) or electrically ( like in emit ) . by choosing the amplitude and the phase of the electrical drive",
    ", one can see either constructive or destructive interference in the mechanical domain ( figure  [ fig : figure_emit_omit_cpt](d ) ) .",
    "unlike pure omit / emit , the interference actually occurs in the acoustic domain and in case of destructive interference , the coherent component of the mechanical motion is zero . in this case",
    ", the system shows coherent population trapping for phonons analogous to the cpt observed in atomic systems .",
    "one can also say that the system has reached a mechanically dark state , and the transmission goes back to that of a bare optical waveguide - cavity system .",
    "system for phonons indicating the optomechanically - driven and rf - driven pathways . ]    the term coherent population trapping was chosen because the overall system , schematically depicted in figure 4a and re - displayed in figure  [ fig : figuresi_level_diagram](a ) , can be viewed from the perspective of the phononic cavity as an effective three - level system , in which the phononic cavity is populated through either an optomechanically - mediated path or an rf - driven path ( figure  [ fig : figuresi_level_diagram](b ) ) .",
    "the mechanical dark state - cancellation of the phononic cavity s coherent mechanical motion - occurs when the strength of the two transitions is equal ( and phase is opposite ) .",
    "this is analogous to the situation in atomic physics , where coherent population trapping refers to an interference occuring when the two terms are equal in amplitude , while eit is used when the control field is much stronger than the probe field  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that an effect analogous to omit , but now consisting of a transparency in the spectrum of propagating acoustic probe phonons due to coupling to intracavity photons , should also be observable in this system .",
    "the inability to achieve perfect cancellation ( a flat transmission spectrum in either the cyan curve from figure 4(c ) , or figure 4(e ) , curve ii ) can be attributed to the difference between the optomechanical ( @xmath154 ) and electromechanical ( @xmath155 ) transduction spectra for different mechanical modes in the optomechanical cavity . to illustrate this , we consider the difference between the omit response wherein we are primarily measuring the optomechanical transduction coefficient and the electro - optic @xmath12 measurement wherein we measure the product of the two :    @xmath156    @xmath157    the optomechanical transduction ( @xmath154 ) is calculated by an overlap integral between the localized optical and mechanical modes whereas the electromechanical transduction is estimated by an overlap integral between the localized mechanical mode and the surface acoustic wave incident on the cavity .",
    "when a surface acoustic wave is incident on the cavity , it excites a superposition of all the mechanical modes of the cavity which lie within the given frequency range and the corresponding mode amplitudes are given by the corresponding transduction coefficients .",
    "this helps us understand why the two spectra appear different ( shown in figure  [ fig : figuresi_saw_omit_diff ] ( a ) ) . in an omit measurement ,",
    "the only mode that is excited with significant amplitude is a mode with strong optomechanical coupling ( in this case , the localized breathing mode ) and hence , the power spectral density has a lorentzian lineshape corresponding to a single mode . when a propagating acoustic wave is incident on the cavity , other modes which might have small optomechanical coupling but significant electromechanical coupling ( due to a strong overlap with the propagating acoustic wave ) also appear in the measured transmission spectrum .",
    "since the acoustic wave interference condition requires both the modes to have similar optomechanical and electromechanical transduction for the cancellation to occur , only the breathing mode is cancelled while the other excitations are not .",
    "this leads to the appearance of residual peaks and a non - flat background in the transmission spectrum .",
    "( note : we believe these additional mechanical modes occur due to fabrication imperfections in the dimensions of the elliptical holes in the nanobeam cavity ) .",
    "as illustrated in the previous section , different closely spaced mechanical modes can have vastly different optomechanical and electromechanical coupling coefficients .",
    "this enables us to demonstrate conclusively that the acoustic wave interference condition shown in figure 4(c ) in the main text occurs in the mechanical domain due to a cancellation between the optomechanical and electromechanical drive terms .",
    "figure  [ fig : figuresi_two_mode_awi ] shows an optomechanical nanobeam cavity with two closely spaced mechanical modes , one the breathing mode which has both strong optomechanical and electromechanical coupling and a second mode which has strong electromechanical coupling but weak optomechanical coupling .",
    "we use the exact same procedure as in figure 4(c ) to probe the device . starting with no rf power applied to the idt",
    ", we see a single lorentzian peak corresponding to omit ( black curve ) wherein only the mode with strong optomechanical coupling is visible .",
    "as we increase the rf power to the idt keeping the phase set for acoustic wave interference , we see that the first mode decreases in amplitude whereas the second ( higher frequency ) mode rises .",
    "this opposite behaviour can be explained by noting that the first mechanical mode ( breathing mode ) is being driven by two terms , the optical drive term due to the beating between the carrier and the phase modulated sideband and the acoustic term due to the surface wave incident on the cavity .",
    "in contrast , the second mode is primarily driven by the propagating acoustic mode .",
    "thus , the first mode clearly demonstrates the acoustic cancellation effect when the two driving terms are comparable in amplitude but opposite in phase whereas the second mode does not show any acoustic wave interference effect because there is only one driving term .",
