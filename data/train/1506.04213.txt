    "it is known that many animal and insect species are capable of sensing extremely weak magnetic fields .",
    "of particular interest amongst biologists , chemists , and physicists is the problem of how migrating species of birds use the earth s magnetic field for navigation @xcite .",
    "the mechanism granting birds the ability to use the geomagnetic field for guidance is known as the avian compass and there is now substantial evidence that certain species ( e.g.  the european robin ) do indeed possess this compass . to date , the most promising model of the avian compass is known as the radical - pair mechanism @xcite , a chemical reaction which takes place inside a photoreceptor molecule in the bird s eye known as cryptochrome @xcite .",
    "the radical - pair model has been a platform on which many interesting theoretical investigations have been carried out since it was first proposed as a candidate explanation for the avian compass @xcite",
    ". one interesting problem , which has also been the subject of recent debate , is the form of its reaction operator .",
    "we will use quantum walks , which is essentially an elaborate theory of kraus maps @xcite , to shed some light on this topic .",
    "this illustrates that quantum walks is a suitable framework for describing coherent chemical kinetics .",
    "the description of radical - pair reactions has conventionally been that of haberkorn s from 1976 @xcite .",
    "this approach is phenomenological and based on arguing which of two existing differential equations for the radical - pair state should be preferred .",
    "the first is proposed by johnson and merrifield @xcite , and evans _ et al .",
    "the second is due to pedersen and freed @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to refs .",
    "@xcite collectively as the johnson ",
    "evans equation for mere convenience .",
    "haberkorn chose the johnson ",
    "evans equation instead of the one due to pedersen and freed by showing that pedersen and freed s equation leads to negative eigenvalues for the radical - pair state whereas the johnson and evans version does not .",
    "both differential equations for the radial - pair state can now be seen to contain terms making up what is known as the lindblad form of master equations @xcite , though neither is actually in lindblad form .",
    "haberkorn s solution was to simply consider what the system state would look like if propagated using the two proposed state derivatives .",
    "the nontriviality in distinguishing the two types of state evolution lies in the fact that it is not immediately obvious how to interpret the proposed state derivatives as opposed to the state itself . in more general and formal language",
    ", haberkorn made his argument by referring to the map @xmath0 which takes a system state from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , rather than the map s generator @xmath3 , which is related to the map by @xmath4 .",
    "hence the generator hence defines the derivative of the state , i.e. @xmath5 . in the context of chemical kinetics , the superoperator @xmath3 is referred to as the reaction operator",
    "of course , today , the lindblad form is well understood ( at least in the quantum optics and quantum information community ) , so the problem pointed out by haberkorn may not be perceived by some to be significant .",
    "however , there is still something to be learnt from haberkorn s work , which is that when considering non - unitary evolution the map @xmath0 may be a more intuitive quantity to consider than the state derivative @xmath3 because @xmath2 is given explicitly by @xmath0 but only implicitly by @xmath3 .",
    "one could in fact argue that this is also the reason why lindblad s result on the form of master equations is nontrivial @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to use @xmath6 instead of @xmath7 in this paper .",
    "haberkorn s preferred reaction operator went unchallenged until recently @xcite , bringing the debate about its form into the limelight again @xcite .",
    "this has resulted in one side arguing in defence of haberkorn and is now referred to as the conventional , phenomenological , or haberkorn approach to radical - pair reactions @xcite .",
    "a separate camp , called the quantum - measurement approach to radical pairs has proposed two new reaction operators , due separately to kominis @xcite and jones and hore @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to us is the paper by jones and hore @xcite who derived their reaction operator using kraus maps @xcite .",
    "the jones  hore equation predicts a different singlet - triplet dephasing rate to the conventional approach of haberkorn s and has been the subject of a recent experiment aimed at discriminating the two models @xcite .",
    "this experiment showed the jones  hore equation to be inconsistent with the measured dephasing rate .",
    "in this paper we also use kraus maps to describe the radical - pair kinetics but we obtain a dephasing rate that is consistent with ref .",
    "a key factor in our approach is the recognition that any intermediate transition in a multistate reaction involve only two states at once .",
    "although this seems trivial , it is what separates our paper from the work of jones and hore because it implies that one can derive the map for a multistate reaction by composing two - state maps only .",
    "maps for multistate reactions derived in this way will thus be correct by virtue of the method ( provided that we have the correct two - state maps ) .",
    "two - state transitions are particularly well understood in quantum information theory since qubits , which are essentially two - state systems , are the central object of study .",
    "the toolbox provided by quantum information theory allows us to construct maps for multistate reactions that are robust to modelling errors .",
    "our approach to the radical - pair reaction kinetics views the reaction as simply a system evolving between a discrete set of states in a probabilistic manner .",
    "since such systems are analogous to random walks , our approach to the problem is one of _ quantum _ walks .",
    "we review quantum walks below and point out the sense in which our version of quantum walks differ from those in the quantum - walk literature .",
    "quantum walk was first introduced in the early 90s by aharanov and coworkers @xcite .",
    "they sought to generalise the idea of a classical walker who can only move left or right in discrete units along one spatial dimension to the quantum case .",
    "they managed to define a quantum walk as the analogue of a classical random walk by correlating the system s spatial coordinate to its internal degree of freedom such as spin , generically called a coin . the coin s ability to be in a superposition of states",
    "can be seen to give rise to quantum walks although the use of a coin is actually not necessary @xcite .",
    "since then quantum walks have proven to be useful in quantum information @xcite where they have found a variety of algorithmic applications @xcite in hitting @xcite and searching @xcite .",
    "quantum walks were first introduced for closed systems which follow unitary evolution , but have recently been generalised to open systems which follow nonunitary evolution , called open quantum walks @xcite .",
    "such evolution is described by a map that is completely positive and trace preserving @xcite , and like their unitary counterpart , the maps defined in refs .",
    "@xcite include changes in the internal degrees of freedom of the open system . to model the radical - pair reaction we propose an evolution map which makes no reference to any internal degrees of freedom .",
    "in this sense our model of the radical - pair reaction is similar to ref .",
    "@xcite with the exception that we allow for nonunitary evolution .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ reactopinlit ] we define the standard radical - pair reaction and review the different reaction operators that have so far been proposed .",

    "maps describing processes known as amplitude - damping , dephasing , and unitary evolution are explained .",
    "we give a detailed exposition of the amplitude - damping map in appendix  [ appad ] to illustrate how the operator - sum representation provides insight to the process which would not have come by so easily if the process was described using a lindblad - form master equation .",

    "an interesting result here is the radical - pair density operator obtained from a partial trace over the chemical products .",

    "[ conclusion ] and discuss its connection with a sequel paper and other relevant literature .",
    "the body of literature discussed here refers to the standard radical - pair reaction shown in fig .",
    "[ stdrpmrates ] .",
    "this is often referred to as a spin - selective recombination reaction @xcite .",
    "it is spin selective because the reaction product depends on the spin state of the reactants , i.e.  the radical pair , while the term recombination refers to the physical process by which the chemical products are obtained : the radical pair is typically formed through the transfer of an electron from one molecule , called the donor , to another molecule , the acceptor , creating a spatially separated pair of entangled spins .",
    "the formation of the chemical products usually involve a back - transfer of this electron from the acceptor to the donor  a recombination of the electron with the vacancy left on the donor molecule ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite for a more complete account of the radical - pair mechanism ) .",
    "the standard radical - pair reaction .",
    "the spin state of the radical pair oscillates coherently between singlet and triplet states under the hyperfine interaction with neighbouring nuclei spins .",
    "this oscillation can be modulated by an external magnetic field and shown to be sensitive to the magnetic field s direction .",
    "this effectively modulates the amount of time the radical pair spends in the singlet state versus the triplet .",
    "since each spin state decays to their own unique product , information about the magnetic field direction is then encoded in the concentrations of the singlet and triplet products.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in line with previous works @xcite we assume a minimal basis @xmath8 for the reaction where @xmath9 denotes the singlet state and @xmath10 the triplet state with zero total spin .",
    "physically this corresponds to the high - field limit where the triplet states with nonzero total spin are sufficiently far away in energy so that they can be safely neglected .",
    "we label the singlet and triplet product states as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 transitions are then characterised by the respective rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we have circled the singlet and triplet states in fig .",
    "[ stdrpmrates ] with a dashed line to emphasise that the system comprises of only the @xmath9 and @xmath10 states . all",
    "known reaction operators are expressed in terms of these states so it will be convenient to define @xmath17 the green dashed boundary in fig .",
    "[ stdrpmrates ] then serves to remind us that in the present discussion , @xmath18 and @xmath19 sums to the identity , i.e.  @xmath20",
    ". this may be useful to keep in mind for later as our approach extends the system hilbert space to include the product states so that @xmath9 and @xmath10 no longer form a complete set .",
    "the problem is to determine the appropriate reaction operator which describes the changes brought upon @xmath2 due solely to the spin - selective recombination taking the spin states to product states . in particular",
    ", this recombination contributes to the singlet - triplet dephasing and we would like to determine what exactly this contribution is .",
    "all other effects such as spin relaxation or effects of molecular motion are ignored .",
    "spin - dependent interactions such as the zeeman , hyperfine , exchange , or dipolar are also ignored . including additional processes other than the spin - selective recombination will tend to increase the dephasing rate .",
    "this will be assumed in all of the reaction operators which are reviewed next , which all describe fig .",
    "[ stdrpmrates ] but without the coherent evolution .",
    "beginning with haberkorn , the reaction operator preferred by his positivity - preserving argument for the radical - pair state is given by @xmath21                    \\equiv { } & - \\frac{1}{2 } \\ ; { k_{\\rm s}}\\big [ { \\hat{q}_{\\rm s}}\\ , \\rho(t ) + \\rho(t ) \\ , { \\hat{q}_{\\rm s}}\\big ] { \\nonumber}\\\\                                & - \\frac{1}{2 } \\ ; { k_{\\rm t}}\\big [ { \\hat{q}_{\\rm t}}\\ , \\rho(t ) + \\rho(t ) \\ , { \\hat{q}_{\\rm t}}\\big ]   \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that this is a non - trace - preserving equation for @xmath2 , the effect of which is to describe leakage of the singlet and triplet populations over time at the rates @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively . equation also predicts a damping of the singlet - triplet coherence at the rate of @xmath24 .",
    "this can be seen by calculating the time derivative of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath2 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "this reaction operator was first questioned by kominis @xcite who argued that the radical - pair reaction is analogous to two coupled quantum dots under continuous measurement by a point contact .",
    "kominis then derived a reaction operator using similar methods as refs .",
    "@xcite which gives @xmath27 we have written @xmath28 in terms of @xmath29 to emphasise that the difference between and lies in the terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the addition of these terms puts kominis s result in linblad form making the evolution trace preserving .",
    "this means that @xmath28 does not describe the loss of singlet or triplet populations as in .",
    "kominis therefore augments his description of the radical - pair kinetics by an additional equation in which the radical - pair population is given by @xmath32   \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 dt \\ ; , \\quad   p_{\\rm t } = { k_{\\rm t}}{\\rm tr}\\big [ { \\hat{q}_{\\rm t}}\\ , \\rho(t ) \\big ] dt \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the respective probabilities of a transition from either @xmath9 to @xmath11 , or @xmath10 to @xmath12 in the infinitesimal interval @xmath34 .",
    "equation does however predict the same dephasing rate as .",
    "this is obvious from since @xmath30 and @xmath31 do not contribute anything to @xmath35 due to the orthogonality of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    spurred on by the measurement analogy made by kominis , jones and hore @xcite attempted a derivation of the radical - pair reaction operator using the operator - sum representation ( see sec .  [ reactopfromqw ] ) .",

    "as already mentioned , this is attributed to the loss of the singlet and triplet populations to the reaction products .",
    "it can be seen that gives this loss rate at @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the singlet and triplet states respectively as expected .",
    "however , the jones ",
    "hore reaction operator @xmath37 gives a dephasing rate which is the sum of the recombination rates , i.e.  @xmath38 , rather than the average predicted by @xmath29 ( or @xmath28 ) . despite being perceived by jones and hore to be too small a difference to be detectable in an experiment @xcite , maeda and colleagues",
    "have recently managed to place the two models under experimental scrutiny @xcite using pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we briefly review some key elements of this experiment below .",
    "the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite uses radical pairs in a modified version of the carotenoid - porphyrin - fullerene triad molecule of ref .",
    "this system has previously been demonstrated to exhibit the anisotropic chemical response to earth - strength magnetic fields required for the avian compass @xcite .",
    "this model system also minimises the singlet - triplet dephasing due to processes other than recombination and has a @xmath23 much smaller than @xmath22 for some temperatures ( between 200240k ) .",
    "this means the dephasing rate in this temperature regime is approximately @xmath39 according to @xmath29 , and @xmath22 according to @xmath37 .",
    "the rate @xmath22 was then measured for this temperature range .",
    "it was shown that for certain temperatures ( a range of about 30k ) , the dephasing rate from the jones ",
    "hore model lied above the measured values while the rate from haberkorn s model always remained below . in practice",
    "there will be other uncontrollable processes which tend to increase the dephasing rate so the measured values of dephasing will not come solely from the @xmath13 recombination .",
    "this means that any reaction operator must produce a dephasing rate which lies below the measured values of @xmath22 for all temperatures and therefore suggests the recombination kinetics according to @xmath37 to be incorrect . in the next section",
    "we show how the idea of quantum walks can be used to derive a reaction operator with a dephasing rate consistent with the experimental data of ref .  @xcite .",
    "kraus published his theory of general state changes in quantum mechanics @xcite in which he asked what form must a superoperator @xmath40 take if it is to map a physically valid state @xmath41 to another physically valid state @xmath42 .",
    "note that we have not actually mentioned time so @xmath42 can be the state of a quantum system after some abstract operation , not necessarily a state at a particular instant in the future of @xmath41 ( although we will use it to propagate the system in time ) .",
    "the answer to the question just posed is that @xmath43 must be of the kraus form , also known as the operator - sum representation of @xmath43 .",

    "@xcite but is given in terms of a photon incident on a beam splitter .",
    "this is an example of a process that can be described by the amplitude - damping map but we believe an explanation involving only ideas from probability theory and basic quantum mechanics to be more direct and fitting for developing the reaction operator .",
    "we have thus included such a detailed exposition in appendix  [ appad ] and provide only a sketch of the amplitude - damping map below .",
    "assuming first for simplicity that we have a two - dimensional system described by @xmath55 and @xmath56 . aside from its hilbert space dimension , the system is otherwise general , and the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 are arbitrary .",

    "thus some fraction of the molecules will jump from state @xmath55 to @xmath56 over some finite time interval . by regarding the transition as a random event we can characterise the process by a probability , @xmath60 , for a given molecule to go from state @xmath58 to @xmath57 in time @xmath51 .",
