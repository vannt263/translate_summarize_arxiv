    "it is well known that a gibbs random field has an equivalent markov random field , and vice versa , provided that all realizations have nonzero probabilities ; this requirement is known as the `` positivity condition '' @xcite .",
    "there are , however , many open questions when there are constraints , which in turn , impose zero probabilities to some outcomes ( i.e. , when there are impossible outcomes ) @xcite . local constraints in the form of zero conditional probabilities are already incorporated into the theory @xcite .",
    "some cases with global constraints are also demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the positivity condition is sufficient but not necessary ; indeed , there are hints that it might not be needed for the equivalence . here in this paper ,",
    "the basic steps and the associated proofs to construct gibbs or markov random fields are revisited .",
    "simpler alternative proofs are provided for many cases .",
    "it is also proven that gibbs random fields and markov random fields are equivalent even if there are impossible ( zero probability , forbidden ) outcomes .",
    "let us start by the set of all outcomes @xmath0 , with its elements @xmath1 having all nonzero probabilities : @xmath2 , for all @xmath1 .",
    "let us assume that these probabilities of elements , @xmath3 may not be known , but all ratios , @xmath4 of such probabilities are known , for all @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is easy to show that these ratios uniquely specify the unknown @xmath7 s for all @xmath5 . to show this ,",
    "let us choose an arbitrary @xmath5 , and consider all ratios @xmath8 , for all @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , @xmath9 which implies @xmath10 and therefore , @xmath11 where the sum over @xmath6 indicates that the summation is running over all elements @xmath12",
    ". therefore , all unknown probabilities can be found from the known ratios of those probabilities .",
    "the reason to explicitly include eq.([rat3 ] ) is to stress the fact that only one arbitrary element @xmath1 may be chosen as the reference , and all ratios of probabilities are given with respect to @xmath13 as @xmath8 , for all @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , it is sufficient to know only such a set of ratios of probabilities , instead of all ratios , to find probabilities , @xmath14 , for all @xmath6 .",
    "any constraint partitions the sample space @xmath15 into two sets , @xmath16 , and its complement @xmath17",
    ". there may be many such constraints , labeled by the index @xmath18 , and in such a case , we are interested in the intersection @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , any @xmath20 satisfies all constraints , and again , the sample space is partitioned into @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "now , let us concentrate on the conditional probabilities @xmath23 .",
    "simply , from the definition of the conditional probabilities , @xmath24 clearly , @xmath25 provided that @xmath21 is not the empty set , since all @xmath1 s have positive probabilities .",
    "now , let us focus only on those outcomes in @xmath21 ; by the way , conditional probabilities are probabilities , i.e. , they satisfy all axioms and properties of a probability structure .",
    "therefore , we simply state that , i ) @xmath26 for @xmath20 , and , ii ) @xmath27 therefore , given two outcomes where both satisfy the constraints , the ratio of their conditional probabilities is still the same as the ratio of their ( unconditional ) probabilities , as expected .",
    "this observation leads us to the conclusion that for any subset @xmath21 , if all the ratios of probabilities ( or equivalently , conditional probabilities , given that both realizations are in @xmath21 ) , @xmath28 s , are known , then the conditional probabilities @xmath29 for all @xmath30 are also known as they are induced by these ratios , following the same steps are in eqs.([rat1]-[rat3 ] ) ; and furthermore , this will also induce the ( unconditional ) probabilities of those elements , as well , if needed .",
    "indeed , the equivalence of a grf to its corresponding mrf , and vice versa , is proven using these ratios of probabilities ; the invariance of these ratios , whether for the unconditional case or the conditional case , assures the grf - mrf equivalence even if there are also constraints . and this is true for any constraint , as long as the set of outcomes satisfying the constraints form a non - empty set .",
    "as already stated , constraints mean zero probabilities as also indicated by eq.([cond ] ) .",
    "starting from the general , and simple , observations above , we can now turn our attention to grfs and mrfs .",
    "( we will use undertilde to describe random variables ; no undertilde will be used for numerical values that these random variables take .",
    "we will use bold fonts to represent vectors ( arrays ) .",
    "for example , @xmath31 means the  probability that the vector random variable @xmath32 takes the specific vector value @xmath33 .",
    "we will also use the notation @xmath34 for the same purpose , whenever we feel this notation is more appropriate . indeed ,",
    "whenever there is no ambiguity in the meaning , we will also use the shortened notation @xmath35 to represent the same probability as described above .",
    "there is no specific meaning attached to lower case or upper case symbols . ) as usual , we assume a set of indexed random variables , @xmath36 ; the number of elements in the set may be finite of infinite .",
    "the index could be called the `` site '' ,",
    "but actually it may or may not be associated with a physical location . the collection of all of those random variables @xmath36 for all @xmath37 , is a vector random variable @xmath38 ; we will call @xmath38 as the `` random pattern '' . a realization of @xmath38 , is denoted by @xmath39 which is a pattern over all sites .    as proven many times , conditional probabilities given for the mrf induce joint probabilities for all outcomes @xmath40 , under the positivity condition @xcite .",
    "however , the provided proofs are unnecessarily complicated and lengthy . instead ,",
    "a simple proof is a direct consequence of the trivial discussion on the ratios of probabilites , as presented above :    let us first prove that an mrf is also a grf .",
    "as before , the set @xmath21 contains all outcomes that satisfy the constraints ; therefore , the elements in @xmath21 all have nonzero probabilities .",
    "so , we can safely form the ratios of such probabilities , as , @xmath41 let us choose patterns @xmath39 from @xmath21 such that their values at all sites , except the specific but arbitrary site @xmath37 , are the same .",
    "the number of such patterns is at least one ; we are interested in cases where this number is greater than one since otherwise the rest of the discussion is trivial . by the way , the number of such patterns could be quite small as a consequence of the constraints , and each such distinct pattern has a different realization for @xmath36 . assuming that there are more than one such patterns ,",
    "we can write , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the realization ( value ) of the random variable @xmath36 at site @xmath37 within the pattern @xmath44 . therefore , the ratio in eq.([rat4 ] ) becomes ,    @xmath45    where we used the markovianity , and @xmath46 is the neighborhood associated with site @xmath37 ( see , for example , @xcite , for the definition and the properties of the neighborhood ) .",
    "therefore , if all conditional probabilities , @xmath47 for all @xmath37 and for all allowed vaules @xmath48 for that location are known when there are constraints , or no constraints ( i.e. , when @xmath49 , the sample space ) , and if the markovianity as indicated by @xmath50 holds for all @xmath37 and @xmath48 ( i.e. , if the field is a mrf ) , we can go backwards through the arguments and obtain the result : given all conditional probabilities @xmath51 and the set indicated by constraints @xmath21 , all ratios @xmath28 for all @xmath52 and @xmath44 in @xmath21 are known ; and from that ( due to eqs.([rat1]-[rat3 ] ) ) all conditional probabilities @xmath53 for all @xmath54 are known and they are positive ; and therefore , we can always write @xmath55 due to nonzero value of @xmath56 , where @xmath18 is just a normalization constant to have the sum of all probabilities equal to one , i.e. , @xmath57 furthermore , noting that , @xmath58 we also know @xmath59 , and therefore , @xmath60 is also known , and is equal to @xmath61 , for all @xmath52 , where @xmath62 is just the new normalization constant to have the sum of all probabilities equal to one . by the way , @xmath63 is called the `` energy '' of the pattern @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , a conditional ( constraint satisfying ) mrf is also a conditional grf .",
    "the terms `` conditional markov random fields ( cmrf ) '' and `` conditional gibbs random fields ( cgrf ) '' are also used in @xcite .",
    "please note that the proof presented above is also valid for the case where there are no constraints , i.e. , when @xmath64 , and therefore , we have also provided an alternative proof that a mrf is equivalent to a grf under the positivity condition , as well .",
    "we believe that this proof is a lot simpler and straightforward than other known proofs , as given , for example in @xcite .",
    "now we will prove that every conditional grf is also a conditional mrf .",
    "if @xmath38 is a grf , then each @xmath65 has a probability in the form @xmath66 as a consequence of the definition of a grf ; we have shown above that the ( unconditional ) probabilities of these patterns are also in the form @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is just the related normalization constant",
    ". we can always decompose any function @xmath67 into an additive form as , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a `` clique '' which simply means a subset of indices ( `` sites '' ) @xmath37 .",
    "the set @xmath70 is the set of all cliques .",
    "the number of elements in a clique ranges from zero up to the maximum number of indices ( sites ) in a pattern ; therefore , that maximum is infinity for infinite size patterns .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the probabilities of two patterns , @xmath44 and @xmath52 becomes , @xmath71 now , let us assume that the patterns @xmath52 , and @xmath44 differ only at one specific site @xmath37 , and they have the same values at all other sites other than @xmath37",
    ". in that case , the above ratio becomes , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the set of only those cliques which have different realizations for @xmath52 , and @xmath44 over them , for a given @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the realizations at site @xmath77 of the patterns @xmath52 , and @xmath44 , respectively . since @xmath52 , and @xmath44 may differ only at site @xmath37 , as a consequence of the above assumption , an equivalent definition of @xmath73 can be given by @xmath78 please note that @xmath79 is the complement of @xmath73 in @xmath70 : @xmath80 .",
    "noting , from eq.([ratgibbs2 ] ) , that @xmath81 we conclude that @xmath82 , @xmath83 are sufficient to compute each term of the last expression above , to yield , @xmath84 and complete the proof that every grf is also a mrf .",
    "please note that the proof is also valid if there are no constraints ; i.e. , when @xmath85 .",
    "based on the discussions above , we can conclude that ,    * the only requirement to write a probability in exponential form is the positivity of that probability ; therefore , any field with positive probability realizations is a grf . *",
    "a grf has an equivalent mrf , and vice versa , when all the realizations ( outcomes ) have positive probabilities .",
    "* at this point , one could get the impression that mrfs , or equivalently grfs , are mathematically so simple : provided that outcomes ( patterns ) in a set of outcomes all have non - zero probabilities , the set forms a mrf ( grf ) .",
    "this is true .",
    "however , the mrf model becomes useful only when the neighborhoods @xmath46 are simple ( small in size ; i.e. , have few indices ( sites ) in it for every @xmath37 ) ; equivalently , grf model becomes useful when the set of cliques @xmath70 contains only simple and few components .",
    "an equivalent statement is that the clique potentials , @xmath86 s , are zero for most cliques ( i.e. , for most subsets @xmath69 of sites ) . in other words ,",
    "the benefits prevail only when the direct statistical interactions among the random variables at different sites are sparse .",
    "obviously , every field with nonzero probability outcomes is a mrf when the sizes of the neighborhoods @xmath46 s reach the size of the entire field ; or equivalently , every field with nonzero probability outcomes is a grf when the sizes of @xmath69 s in @xmath70 are allowed to reach the size of the entire field ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) . in such cases ,",
    "one may still call the field as a mrf with the neighborhood size equal to the size of the entire field ; or may choose to leave those extreme cases out of the definition and say that those cases are not mrfs ( grfs ) ; we prefer the first alternative in this paper . *",
    "the neighborhood of a site is not necessarily near ( here we assume that the sites form a lattice , and therefore , a distance measure is applicable ) to that site ; indeed , the simplicity ( sparsity ) of a neighborhood scheme is based on the number of sites in a neighborhood , and not where they are located . *",
    "extension of the proofs for the markov case where the `` interior '' is no longer a single site , but more than one site , is straightforward . *",
    "the discussion is valid both for causal fields , as well as non - causal ones ; the causality is a direct consequence of the neighborhood shape ( see , for example @xcite for the definition of `` causal '' and , `` non - causal '' random fields ) .",
    "* grfs are usually simpler to handle than mrfs . *",
    "inclusion of constraints , which in turn means zero probability outcomes , does not violate the mrf - grf equivalence or the basic structures of grfs and the mrfs .",
    "this is a consequence of the observation that the constraints result in a smaller set of non - zero probability realizations , and within that smaller set , all other features that leads to the equivalence is still valid and the same as the unconstrained case .",
    "* these conclusions are valid both for the finite size or infinite size random fields .",
    "* simple proofs are given for above statements ; the proofs are direct consequences of elementary probability theory , and techniques .",
