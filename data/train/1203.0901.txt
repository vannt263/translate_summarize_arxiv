    "the nrg we employ is one appropriate to the study of continuum field theories @xcite which in turn is based upon wilson s numerical renormalization group first used to study quantum impurity problems @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind wilson s numerical approach is that one performs a series of numerical diagonalizations which are ordered such that `` important '' states in the considered hilbert space of the problem are taken into account first , while the effect of less important states are included only in subsequent diagonalizations .",
    "the sequence of diagonalizations , the sequence of renormalizations , are done such that the numerical burden is the same at each step in the sequence .",
    "the metric that determines the order in which states are taken into account , however , is arbitrary and can be chosen to be appropriate for the problem at hand . in wilson s case ,",
    "namely the kondo problem where the impurity spin sits at the end of a half line lattice , states involving only the kondo spin together with nearby lattice sites are taken into account first . that such states are most significant is guaranteed by lattice hopping parameters that decrease in magnitude the further one gets away from the impurity .",
    "in the case of a quantum critical ising model perturbed by a magnetic field ( considered in @xcite ) the hilbert space used to form the matrices in the sequence of numerical diagonalizations is that of the quantum critical ising model .",
    "the states in this model are ordered in terms of energy ( relative to the unperturbed theory ) . here",
    "low - energy states are the most important as the spin operator coupling to the magnetic field is highly relevant and so are taken into account first by the renormalization group .",
    "however for models like the ll model in a trapping potential the complexity of the eigenstates ( as we have discussed in the main body of the text ) means that energy alone is not a sufficient metric for the nrg to distinguish important from less important states ; using such a limited metric would make the procedure drastically sub - optimal . to overcome this problem",
    "we introduce a variational metric in the space of states similar to that used to compute the single particle spectrum of semiconducting carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "although this latter problem could be represented as a perturbation of a conformal field theory ( cft ) , the cft was complex enough ( four bosons ) that the same issues arose .",
    "this variational metric uses an iterative process which amounts to performing successively higher order computations in perturbation theory to determine which states are likely to significantly contribute to the low - energy spectrum of the fully perturbed theory .        while the primary concern of the accompanying letter was the discussion of correlations ,",
    "we feel it is important here to provide some details of the method so that readers can be reassured that we can describe the gas in the trap accurately , that is to say , that we can provide a reasonable description of the pre - quench state .",
    "we will provide a more detailed description of these computations in a future publication @xcite .    to demonstrate this we focus on the large @xmath95 limit where in the extreme tonks - girardeau limit ( @xmath29 ) the system reduces to one of free fermions ( at least for the computation of the energy ) in a trap and where @xmath96 corrections can be systematically computed by mapping the bose system to one of fermions interacting with an ultra - short ranged potential with strength proportional to @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "we present the computation of the ground state energies in fig .",
    "4 . in the left panel",
    "we present the ground state energies of the gas ( with @xmath27 ) in traps of different strengths , @xmath34 .",
    "we get good agreement between the nrg computation and the analytics ( better than 0.02% for the first three trap values and about 1% for the largest of the trap values , @xmath68 , studied ) . in the right panel",
    "we show the computation of the ground state energies as a function of @xmath95 for values running from @xmath23 to @xmath30 for the same four values of the trap strength . in order to match analytics with numerics we needed to include corrections up to @xmath97 . computing the @xmath96 correction is straightforward .",
    "the @xmath98 correction , when computed naively with second order perturbation theory , shows an ultraviolet divergence related to the ultra short ranged potential of the equivalent fermionic model .",
    "this divergence can however be regulated with a point splitting procedure adopted from ref .",
    "however these first two corrections are not enough to get good agreement for the @xmath30 values of the ground state energies .",
    "we thus include the @xmath97 correction coming from the untrapped gas and which is readily computed from its integrability @xcite .",
    "with these three analytic contributions in place , we see we get excellent agreement for the first three trap values while the strongest trap value ( @xmath68 ) continues to see a deviation on the order of @xmath99 for all values of @xmath95 .",
    "finally we consider our ability to accurately compute the density profile of the gas in the trap .",
    "this is a much more complicated quantity to compute than the ground state energies , since the matrix elements of the density operator must be employed . in fig .",
    "5 we plot the density profile of the gas for two values of trapping strength and two values of @xmath95 .",
    "again we work at larger values of @xmath95 where we can compare our numerics to an analytic computation ( @xmath29 plus first order @xmath96 corrections ) .",

    "8 , the de - gge curves maintain , roughly speaking , the same shape between the @xmath103 and @xmath27 . because of how the ssf is scaling with system size and our choice of units for momenta , this means the difference between these two ensembles is decreasing as system size grows .",
    "however the same can not be said for the de - gce curves .",
    "for the larger system size , the de - gce curves are notably more upturned at small momenta suggesting that in the infinite volume limit , the two ensembles will yield different results for the ssf .",

    "the nrg gives a ground state in the form @xmath148 where @xmath9 are exact eigenstates of the untrapped gas .",

    "<S> using a numerical renormalization group based on exploiting an underlying exactly solvable nonrelativistic theory , we study the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of a 1d bose gas ( as described by the lieb - liniger model ) released from a parabolic trap . </S>",

    "<S> dynamics observed using our method .    </S>",
    "<S> understanding non - equilibrium quantum quench behavior in low - dimensional systems is a difficult theoretical challenge . because one is initializing the system in a state that is not an eigenstate , </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is determined not merely by the system s ground state ( or a small number of excited states ) , but rather by some coherent sum of a large number of eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> if one wants to explore the emergence of a resulting steady state , the time evolution of this coherent sum must then be tracked over long periods of time . </S>",
    "<S> this problem confronts theorists who wish to understand dynamics in perturbed quantum gases @xcite , ultrafast phenomena in superconductors @xcite , and questions of thermalization in integrable systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this last set of questions arise because of the surprising experimental finding that a perturbed one - dimensional bose gas retains memory of its initial non - equilibrium state over long periods of time @xcite and does not appear to relax to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium . to understand this , </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed @xcite that equilibriation does occur but not as described by a grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) . </S>",
    "<S> instead the ensemble describing equilibriation needs to take into account the additional , non - trivial conserved quantities that , at least according to the theoretical minimal model of the gas ( the lieb - liniger ( ll ) model @xcite ) , are present in the system . </S>",
    "<S> this new ensemble has been dubbed the generalized gibbs ensemble ( gge ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gge takes as the density matrix @xmath0 where the @xmath1 form an independent , complete sequence of conserved quantities in the system and @xmath2 correspond to a set of generalized ( inverse ) temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> computation of this density matrix is non - trivial and has only been successfully accomplished in certain special limits . </S>",
    "<S> most of these limits are in models where interactions ( though not necessarily correlation functions ) correspond to a free model ( the hard core limit of the interacting bose gas @xcite , quadratic hamiltonians @xcite , luttinger liquids @xcite , the sine - gordon model at the free - fermion point and in the semi - classical limit @xcite , and the quantum ising model in the absence of a longitudinal field @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a notable exception was the study of fioretto and mussardo @xcite where it was possible to study quenches in general interacting integrable models but with the restriction to a very special set of quench protocols .    </S>",
    "<S> it is against this backdrop that we present a general methodology able to study non - equilibrium behavior and quench dynamics of low - dimensional interacting models , both integrable and non - integrable . </S>",
    "<S> this method is predicated on a numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) able to study models which can be represented as perturbed integrable and conformal field theories ( cft ) @xcite : @xmath3 the ll model in a trapping potential takes this form . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this methodology is a valuable addition to other general methodologies used to study dynamics in low - dimensional systems such as the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group @xcite . at least for a subset of quenches , where we quench into an integrable system ( say by turning off the trapping potential in a ll system ) , we can track the dynamics for all times .    </S>",
    "<S> concomitant with the introduction of this tool to study quench dynamics , we present a general methodology to compute the density matrix of the gge using information arising from the application of the nrg . </S>",
    "<S> we show how one can write down a simple set of equations governing the gge and how the entire infinite set of generalized temperatures , @xmath4 can be readily determined .    </S>",
    "<S> the specific example we consider is the ll model perturbed by a one - body parabolic trap @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( we will work in units where @xmath7 ) . in running the nrg </S>",
    "<S> , we use the basis of eigenstates of the ll model and their matrix elements with respect to the trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> both the description of the states and the computation of matrix elements in the ll model are much more complicated than the examples of relativistic field theories where the nrg has been applied previously . the states in the ll model consist of n strongly interacting particles and not few - particle excitations above the true vacuum state , while the matrix elements do not see a chiral factorization as in a relativistic gapless theory but are n - dimensional determinants @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to tackle this , we took recourse to a highly optimized set of routines known as abacus @xcite which solves and evaluates all equations needed to characterize both the necessary eigenstates and their matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> this package has been shown to be able to successfully compute dynamical response functions for the ll model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we first use the nrg to extract the ground state of the ll model in a trap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nrg produces the ground state of the gas , @xmath8 , as a linear combination of exact eigenstates , @xmath9 , of the ll model : @xmath10 in order to accurately describe the ground state in the nrg procedure we typically consider on the order of @xmath11 states . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider a sudden release of the trap , that is we will study the gas where we quench into an integrable model . </S>",
    "<S> for these types of quenches our methodology gives us the ability to study the evolution of the gas for arbitrary times . </S>",

    "<S> the logic of the gge is such that it is expected to describe correlations that are local in space ( and that involve a distance scale significantly smaller than the system size ) . </S>",

    "<S> it would be interesting to understand if this missing entropy is solely associated with non - local correlations .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrated how an nrg based on exploiting the integrability of the ll model can be used to study the time - dependent evolution after a quantum quench where a 1d gas is released from a parabolic trap . </S>",
    "<S> we have also demonstrated how to use the information arising from the nrg to construct the corresponding gge which has been suggested as a possibility for governing the post - quench dynamics . while we have focused on the ll model , this methodology is applicable to any non - relativistic integrable theory of which the heisenberg and xxz spin chains are two prominent examples .    </S>",
