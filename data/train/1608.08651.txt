    "the role of memory in the statistical properties of complex systems is emerging as an important new direction of study @xcite .",
    "in particular , memristive circuits ( circuits made of resistors with memory ) are attracting considerable attention in view of their similarities with the dynamics of self - organizing systems such as swarms ( e.g. , ants ) , and their ability to solve certain optimization problems @xcite .",
    "in fact , the physical properties of memristors are relevant both for their practical use , such as in the field of unconventional computing @xcite , as well as to understand the collective behavior and learning abilities of certain biological systems @xcite , including the brain @xcite .",
    "a key signature of these networks is the presence of time nonlocality ( memory ) , a feature , that coupled with kirchhoff s conservation laws , promotes unexpected phenomena , such as first - order phase transitions as a function of memory content @xcite or avalanches @xcite .    yet , very little analytical advances have been made for complex circuits made of memristors , due to the strong non - local behaviour introduced by the network constraints , such as the circuit conservation laws , that make numerical results all but necessary . in turn , it is still unclear how the memory dynamics of each element depends on the graph connectivity .",
    "another important issue is the role of memory in the _ relaxation to steady state _ of memristive networks . in other words ,",
    "the question `` how does an excitation in a disordered network of memristive elements relax to steady state ? '' , has yet to be answered . as mentioned above , this is not just an academic exercise : these types of networks are being employed to solve complex problems in a variety of different modes .",
    "hence , an answer to this query bears immediate relevance to the question of how efficient such systems are as computing machines and how fast they converge to the their asymptotic stable states .    in this paper",
    "we make three fundamental advances . for the case of linear current - controlled memristors ,",
    "we demonstrate a closed matrix equation of motion for the _ internal _ memory of the circuit , which embeds the conservation laws of the system . with this equation in hand",
    ", we show that such networks can support scale - free temporal correlations induced by the network non - local properties .",
    "we provide an analytical demonstration of this fact using the simplest model of linear memristors , which is a good approximation for a variety of actual physical systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , by means of graph - theoretic tools we show explicitly that the spatial and temporal sectors of the dynamics are coupled by orthogonal projections onto the subspace of fundamental current loops .",
    "this coupling ensures the emergence of a power law as superposition of exponential relaxations times with a broad range of scales , which is the typical signature of  glassy \" behavior .",
    "slow relaxation phenomena have been already observed experimentally . specifically , in @xcite it has been observed that the frequency spectrum of the resistance in atomic switch networks is a power law , which could be due either to self - organized criticality or to a superposition of a broad range of relaxation time - scales as we observe in the present paper .",
    "ultimately , our derived equation may serve as the basis for further analysis of the relaxation properties of circuits with memory .",
    "in fact , for the case of ac forcing , we are able to obtain for the first time an approximate analytical solution in the case in which the projector operator is diagonally dominant .",
    "we test our obtained approximate solution in the case of a specific graph configuration .",
    "let us start by considering the exact solution of a linear circuit  , written in terms of graph quantities such as the loop matrix description of a circuit @xcite , focusing on linear memristors .",
    "specifically , we employ a slightly modified version of a widely used linear model of memristors described by the equations that relate the current @xmath0 to the voltage @xmath1 @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the internal memory state variable , @xmath4 represents the polarity of the memristor , @xmath5 the limiting resistance when the memristor is in the conducting phase , and @xmath6 is a constant . in the case of the memristors of ref .",
    "@xcite , made of an oxide thin film sandwiched between two metal layers with oxygen vacancies , one has @xmath7 , where @xmath8 represents the electron mobility and @xmath9 the size of the memristor .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 quantifies the rate of decay of the memory when all generators are switched off .",
    "the memory resistance we consider is limited between the values @xmath11 in the insulating phase and @xmath5 in the conducting one , and depends linearly only on the dynamical internal parameter @xmath12 , @xmath13 , \\label{eq : memr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have implicitly defined the constant @xmath14 , typically @xmath15 .    for generic linear circuits",
    ", it is well known that one can write the solution of the current configuration as a function of the current and voltage sources and the _ cycle matrix _",
    "@xmath16 of the graph associated to the circuit @xcite . in order to understand the derivation in simple terms ,",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig : network ] .",
    "the cycle matrix is a rectangular matrix of size @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of _ fundamental loops _ and @xmath19 the number of resistors / memristors .",
    "its introduction is motivated by the following observation : due to the kirchhoff s constraints on the currents , only a certain number of currents  which equals the number of fundamental loops of the circuit  are linearly independent .",
    "the number of fundamental loops can be easily calculated from basic graph theory @xcite , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of nodes of the circuit , and @xmath22 is the number of edges in the tree @xmath23 , called chords .",
    "the complementary set of edges is denoted with @xmath24 , and these edges called co - chords .",
    "therefore , the number of fundamental loops is equal to the number of co - chords .    to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the case in which there are no current sources , only voltage sources parametrized as elements of a vector @xmath25 on the set of edges ( or arcs ) of the graph .",
    "similarly , let us introduce a diagonal matrix of ( mem)ristances @xmath26 , where the index @xmath27 runs over the edges of the network .",
    "the formal solution of the current configuration , @xmath28 , as a function of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath16 is then given by @xcite : @xmath31    , which in the figure is given by the red edges .",
    "each element of the tree , @xmath23 is a _",
    "chord_. every remaining edge which is not in the spanning tree set is called _ co - chord _ ; for each _ co - chord _ it is possible to assign a _ mesh _",
    "variable or _ fundamental loop .",
    "_ ]    the derivation is standard but elegant and is provided for completeness in the supplemental material .",
    "equation is the starting point of our analysis .",
    "we consider the physically relevant case of a decay to the @xmath11 state when there are no sources in the circuit .",
    "this is consistent with experimental observations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given a diagonal matrix @xmath32 such that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is 1 for all memristors up to @xmath19 , one has @xmath35 , where @xmath29 is still a positive diagonal matrix and contains the absolute values of the resistances .",
    "we can however absorb the matrix @xmath32 into the matrix @xmath16 , by defining @xmath36 .",
    "we now note that the resistance matrix is the one of linear memristors as in , where we introduce the internal memory vector @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 if we introduce the diagonal matrix @xmath39 , we can then write the equation for the internal memory states as the following equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the matrix which contains the polarity of the memristors . for @xmath42",
    "the resistance decays to the @xmath11 state in the absence of sources , and for @xmath43 to the @xmath5 state .",
    "this term is independent from the cycle matrix @xmath16 , meaning that this is a property of each single memristor , and not a global network effect .",
    "we consider the case of homogeneous memristor properties , i.e. , they all have identical off and on states .",
    "it is of course easy to generalize our results to the inhomogeneous case .",
    "these equations are insofar general . for any circuit ,",
    "the inverse of @xmath44 exists so long as @xmath29 has all non - zero entries on the diagonal , which is the case if both @xmath5 and @xmath11 are either positive or negative . in order to simplify the notation",
    ", we introduce the matrix @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . by construction",
    ", @xmath47 is an orthogonal projector onto the subspace of fundamental current loops if all resistances in the circuit are all either positive or negative , while it is non - orthogonal there is a mixture of positive and negative resistances .",
    "let us now set @xmath48 .",
    "after a lengthy but trivial computation we then derive the following equation for the internal memory ( see supplemental material ) : @xmath49 with @xmath50 the identity matrix .",
    "this is the central result of our paper .",
    "it is a compact equation that describes the dynamics of the internal memory states of memristors in linear circuits based upon projection operators .",
    "few comments are in order .",
    "first of all , has been derived with the assumption of invertibility of @xmath51 . strictly speaking ,",
    "this means that we are considering the bulk of the dynamics , i.e. , when no memristor is in the @xmath5 state . nevertheless , the final formula is independent of @xmath52 and is numerically well - behaved for @xmath53 , which suggests it can be extended to the boundaries as well .",
    "we note moreover that @xmath54 plays the role of the amount of non - linearity in the systems .",
    "in addition , satisfies all the network constraints and kirchhoff s laws .",
    "the importance of the number of fundamental loops is shown by the fact that @xmath55 , which implies that the operator @xmath47 contains information only on the fundamental loops of the circuit .",
    "we have that @xmath56 , and thus @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is an orthogonal projection .",
    "this implies that we can always decompose any matrix or vector @xmath59 , with @xmath60 . for the case of passive components",
    ", we can identify the operator @xmath61 as @xmath62 , with @xmath63 being the reduced incidence matrix ( see supplemental material ) . given the matrix @xmath64 ,",
    "we can write the identity @xmath65 and using the fact that @xmath66 , it is easy to prove that @xmath67 , which provides a nice interpretation for the complementary projector . moreover , the separation between linearity and non - linearity is explicit in and is controlled by the constant @xmath68 .",
    "we now study the consequences of numerically focusing on passive elements only .",
    "we take advantage of the fact that there is a simple parametrization for projector operators , given that we are interested in the _ average _ properties of the dynamics . in this way , the only two relevant parameters are @xmath19 and @xmath21 , the number of memristors and the number of nodes , respectively .",
    "we then generate a random matrix @xmath16 of size @xmath69 and evaluate the matrix @xmath47 according to the equation @xmath70 .",
    "the matrix @xmath16 is of the form @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is generated using random entries with probability @xmath73 for the discrete values @xmath74 .",
    "we then consider the quenched dynamics for the memory parameters @xmath75 by integrating numerically using an explicit euler method and studying the relaxation to steady state .",
    "in addition to the bulk equation , we also included the constraints on the internal memory states @xmath76 .",
    "for the present paper we focus on the case without active components , i.e. , we set @xmath77 . for the case of constant - voltage relaxation , we study the relaxation numerically , and using we provide arguments to explain its average behavior .",
    "we consider first the case in which the applied voltage is constant in time .",
    "such case differs from the ac one , since every memristor eventually reaches an asymptotic boundary value of 0 or 1 .",
    "we performed numerical simulations for the evolution of the average memory parameters @xmath78 as a function of time for each single realization in fig .",
    "[ fig : secondmod ] ( top ) .",
    "we observe that the relaxation behavior is characterized by a slow convergence towards the asymptotic values .",
    "we differentiate the trajectories reaching the 1 s values from the ones reaching the 0 s values . in fig .",
    "[ fig : secondmod ] ( top ) we show that both trajectories can be fitted by a power law .",
    "we observe this in the limit @xmath15 and in the numerics we choose @xmath79 .",
    "the blue and red curves represent the average parameters for the superior and inferior boundary of the memory , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : secondmod ] ( bottom ) we plot the best fit with power law ( red curve ) @xmath80 , with @xmath81 , where the top boundary has been inverted , i.e. , @xmath82 .",
    "( finite size effects are discussed in the supporting information . )",
    "let us approximate the curve of each memristor as an exponential , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the initial value of the @xmath27th memristor .",
    "we focus only on the memristors which converge to @xmath85 values .",
    "we then assume that there exists a certain distribution @xmath86 of decay times , @xmath87 .",
    "the average behavior of the internal memory is thus given by : @xmath88 where we assumed that @xmath89 and @xmath87 are uncorrelated .",
    "if we introduce the inverse time scale @xmath90 , @xmath91 , one has @xmath92 where @xmath90 is an artificial time scale , playing the role of a cutoff .",
    "we thus obtain the result that for @xmath93 , on average , memristors thermalize to the steady state as @xmath94 .    using the relation between the projector in the loop space and the complementary projector based on the incidence matrix , it is easy to simulate arbitrary topologies .",
    "in fact , we note that such `` glassy '' behaviour shows some universal properties , i.e. , _ it is independent of the graph topology _ used .",

    "the emergence of a scale - free thermalization of the mean internal parameter shows that disordered memristive networks exhibit an _ aging _ phenomenon , typical of glassy materials @xcite .",
    "although being dramatically different , an analogy to the sherrington - kirkpatrick model stems naturally in our analysis : the circuit graph generated at random induces a random projector @xmath104 , which in turn induces a random coupling matrix @xmath119 .",

    "the former requirement depends on the network topology , while the latter is a condition on the applied voltages , i.e. , if the forcing is ac and the voltages are small enough .",

    "the limit of such approximation is however clear for larger values of @xmath54 , with the exact solution deviating for a few memristors from the numerical solution .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived a matrix differential equation for the evolution of the internal memory states of linear current - driven memristors in a circuit .",
    "the differential equation is general and solves the circuit constraints based upon the graph theoretical derivation of the current configuration , using the formalism of spanning trees and fundamental loops in networks .",
    "such equation establishes a very clear connection between the theory of projector operators and the dynamics of linear memristive circuits .",
    "in particular , we have found that the network dynamics of the internal memory of the circuit can be constructed from only a single matrix , the projector on the space of fundamental loops of the circuit , which contains the information on the network topology and the conservation laws .",
    "this shows that the internal memory of the memristors is insensitive to certain forcing modes which fall in the kernel of the projection operator .",
    "we believe such equation to be an important tool for obtaining a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the internal memory of memristive circuits .    by focusing on the case of dc - controlled circuits ,",
    "we have provided sufficient evidence that the average relaxation of the internal memory to the boundary values is far from exponential and `` universal '' , namely topology - independent .",
    "we have shown this by generating random projection operators , but such result is consistent with simulations performed using memristive random circuits .",
    "we have also given arguments that the slow relaxation is due to the superposition of memristive dynamics decaying with a broad range of time scales at least in the regime of `` shallow '' memory , i.e. , when non - linearities are negligible .",
    "for the case of ac controlled circuits , we have shown that an approximate solution can be obtained , and which agrees with the numerical solution in the limit of the approximation of low memory and for diagonally dominant projector operators .",
    "this also provides direct evidence of the usefulness of the derived equations , and shows in a specific sense how the graph topology and the constraints enter the dynamics of the internal memory .",
    "we have also studied the projector operator in the case of a simple graph with a local structure .",
    "we have shown that although the graph exhibits a local structure , a certain amount of non - local spatial correlations emerges due to the circuit constraints .",
    "this non - local correlation is found to be bounded by an exponential function in the hamming distance on the graph .",
    "these results reveal the rich dynamics of complex networks with memory and establishes a new research direction in memristive circuits .",

    "in this section we recall the basics of graph theory used to derive and provide the notation used throughout the main text @xcite .",
    "we start by considering a graph @xmath150 with @xmath21 nodes and @xmath19 edges which describes the topology of a resistive circuit .",
    "as it is standard practice , we then introduce an orientation @xmath151 for the currents circulating on the graph , which has @xmath152 possible configurations , with @xmath153 being the number of edges ( or arcs ) . from the point of view of graph theory ,",
    "the graph representing the circuit must be connected , and the degree of each node @xmath27 satisfies @xmath154 . for each node",
    ", we can introduce a potential vector @xmath155 , and for each edge a current @xmath156 , where we use latin indices for the edges , and greek indices for the nodes ; greek indices with tildes represent instead cycles on the graph . given an orientation @xmath151 , we can introduce two matrices : @xmath157 , which is a matrix of size @xmath158 , and a cycle matrix @xmath159 , which is of size @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the number of cycles of the graph . from now on , we will suppress the orientation apex for simplicity .",
    "a valid current configuration is one in which @xmath162 , which represents the kirchhoff current law ( kcl ) . in order for @xmath63 to have the linear independence of the rows , one row has to be removed , introducing thus the _ reduced incidence matrix_. in the following , we will thus consider only results derived with this matrix rather than the full one .    given a potential vector based on the nodes , the vector of voltages applied to each edge can be written as @xmath163 , where @xmath164 represents the matrix transpose .",
    "the kirchhoff voltage law ( kvl ) can thus be written as @xmath165 , an equation which is simply saying in graph theory terms that the circuitation of the voltage on edges belonging to a cycle ( or _ mesh _ in circuits ) must be zero .",
    "this automatically implies that in general @xmath166 .",
    "analogously , this implies that @xmath167 , which represents the conservation of energy , or _ tellegen s theorem _ in circuits .",
    "let us now introduce a spanning tree @xmath23 ( _ co - chords _ ) , and the set of edges of the graph not included in the tree as @xmath23 , _ or chords _ , are given by @xmath24 .",
    "for each element of the chord @xmath24 , we assign a cycle , called _ fundamental loop_. the number of fundamental loops is given by @xmath20 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "each current can be written as a superposition of the currents flowing in the fundamental loops , denoted with @xmath168 , and one has that @xmath169 . in the basis",
    "in which we reorder the edges in the tree to come first , one can write @xmath170 , and since now @xmath171 corresponds to fundamental cycles , @xmath171 is the identity matrix , @xmath172 . a similar rearrangement can be made also for the the incidence matrix @xmath63 , and thus one has @xmath173 , which implies @xmath174 .",
    "we now note that since @xmath175 , one has @xmath176 .",
    "since @xmath172 , this implies that @xmath177 .",
    "since @xmath16 is derived from the _ reduced _ incidence matrix , this is called _ reduced loop matrix_.    if we now write the equation for the circuit , i.e. , @xmath178 , we note that applying the operator @xmath16 on the left , we obtain the identity @xmath179 .",
    "we now use @xmath180 , and obtain @xmath181 . if we now write the solution of the current , we obtain @xmath182 which is the starting point of this paper . we stress that since @xmath16 is derived from a reduced incidence matrix , then @xmath183 is always invertible for non - zero resistances",
    ".   +      the starting point of the derivation is .",
    "we consider the convention in which @xmath184 corresponds to @xmath5 and @xmath98 to @xmath11 , which is a memristor with opposite polarity to the one introduced in @xcite .",
    "first of all , let us first say that it is easy to parametrize the presence of active components .",
    "in this case , one can simply introduce negative resistances in , for instance introducing a matrix @xmath185 , where @xmath186 are assigned to passive components , while @xmath187 to active components .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath32 satisfies the property @xmath188 .",
    "the resistances are thus encoded in the matrix @xmath189 , and simply becomes @xmath190    as in the main text , we define the matrix @xmath191 and we also use the dynamical properties of the memristors , @xmath192 , with @xmath193 representing the polarity of the memristor . the goal of this section is to derive a dynamical equation which is in terms of projectors only . for this purpose , we use the woodbury identity to write the equation in terms of projector only , @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath161 are square matrices of size @xmath196 and @xmath197 respectively , and @xmath198 and @xmath199 are rectangular matrices , and which is valid as long as @xmath195 and @xmath161 have inverses .",
    "we first introduce the parameter @xmath48 which , as it will become clear soon , can be thought of as the amount of nonlinearity present in the system . using , we are thus able to rewrite the inverse @xmath200 , obtaining : @xmath201    where we introduced the operator @xmath202 .",
    "it is important to say that the operator @xmath203 is invertible , as we are considering the reduced loop matrix , and @xmath41 is full rank by construction . using the result of for the inverse @xmath204 and derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : inver ] , we can now obtain the final equation : @xmath205 where we introduced @xmath206 .",
    "if we now use the identity @xmath188 , we can write @xmath207 , and obtain the equation @xmath208 in which we used the fact that @xmath209=0 $ ] since the two matrices are diagonal and @xmath210 . finally , we use the fact that @xmath211 , and obtain the final result shown in . using the matrix taylor expansion in @xmath48 , we can finally write the equation : @xmath212 which is our final result . we note that @xmath213 is the most general description of a non - orthogonal projection operator . in the matricial limit @xmath214 , then @xmath215 and thus the projector becomes orthogonal again .",
    "it is also easy to see that for @xmath216 , then @xmath217 . as such",
    ", @xmath47 is indeed an invariant under this symmetry .",
    "in fact , @xmath218 , and thus @xmath104 is invariant .",
    "however , @xmath219 , which means that this is simply a change of current flow .",
    "although currents in a circuit are defined up to a change of direction , this implies that the circuit is not invariant under this symmetry .",
    "the above result can , in principle , be extended with little effort to the case of voltage - controlled memristors .",
    "let us assume that the equation for the evolution of internal memory is of the type : @xmath220 in this case , we can write : @xmath221 and using the equations we derived , we obtain : @xmath222 which is the extension of the equation above to the case of voltage - controlled memristors .",
    "let us now prove an inversion equation , where we assume that @xmath63 and @xmath223 are invertible : @xmath224 and aim to find the matrix @xmath225 . by definition",
    ", we have : @xmath226 using this identity , we can find the matrix @xmath225 by inversion : @xmath227 which can be rewritten as : @xmath228 this implies the following inversion formula : @xmath229 which is the identity we use to reach the final equation , and requires only the invertibility of the matrices @xmath63 and @xmath223 , but not the invertibility of @xmath104 .",
    "such identity is important since in our case @xmath104 represents a projector operator , meanwhile @xmath63 represents @xmath230 . starting from the identity @xmath231",
    ", we obtain the identity : @xmath232 which implies that : @xmath233 this is the result we used in order to derive the differential equation for the internal memory .",
    "we now mention some observed factors influencing the quality of the power law .",
    "the number of memristors controls the emergence of the power law decay .",
    "numerically , we observe that @xmath234 is enough to have a faithful power law . in fig . [",
    "fig : nmfixed ] we can see that when @xmath235 is fixed and @xmath236 , the limit @xmath19 can be considered as a thermodynamic limit , i.e. , the power law emerges for large @xmath19 .    , with @xmath237 and initial memristors set at @xmath100 .",
    "these are not averaged over many quenched dynamics , but single simulations .",
    "we observe that for increasing values of @xmath19 , the curves suppress the fluctuations and converge to the slow dynamics phenomenon for the average memory . ]      in this section we derive the approximate solution for the case of ac forcing of the main equation derived in the text . for a single memristor ( or single mesh )",
    "it is in fact possible to derive an exact equation for the memory , and this applies also to the simpler case of many memristors in parallel , for which @xmath104 is a diagonal matrix .",
    "it is thus clear that for a class of graphs for which @xmath104 is diagonal such quadrature can be obtained in the case in which the memristors will not reach the boundary values , thus in the approximation of differentiable dynamics .",
    "it is thus important that we understand first in which sense it is possible to approximate a matrix by a diagonal one . as it turns out , this statement depends on the type of functional one aims to minimize .",
    "specifically , in which sense is it possible to say that @xmath238 where @xmath239 is a diagonal matrix ?",
    "such approximation is valid for the case in which @xmath240 and @xmath239 are acting on a vector , as we will show shortly .",
    "we demand that , given any vector @xmath241 , @xmath242 is true point - wise for each element of the resulting vector , and thus obtain @xmath243 thus , for any element @xmath244 , one has : @xmath245 and thus we require that @xmath246 .",
    "summing over @xmath247 we obtain : @xmath248 once we have derived the diagonal matrix which approximate @xmath249 , the derivation follows similar steps to the case of a single memristor .",
    "we first multiply by @xmath47 , noticing that the rhs of this equation is invariant under this transformation , and subsequently by @xmath250 , obtaining @xmath251 since @xmath47 is a projector , it is necessary to account at the end for this step .",
    "we now use the diagonal approximation of the matrix @xmath249 applied on the vector @xmath252 , we can now repeat the steps of the single memristor case for each single element , with the key difference that now the memory has to be projected on the loop space .",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath253 , and after having introduced @xmath254 , obtain : @xmath255 since @xmath239 is a diagonal matrix , @xmath256 acts on each element of the vector as @xmath257 .",
    "we thus note that we can write the matrix equation again as vectorial equation , and for each component write : @xmath258    in the case in which the sources are ac controlled with @xmath259 , the memory elements will oscillate without ever reaching the boundaries . in this case , the solution we provided fully describes the dynamics . in order to see this ,",
    "we write explicitly the solution as a function of @xmath104 .",
    "we parametrize @xmath30 as @xmath260 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath261 we now impose that the pseudo - inverse of the matrix @xmath104 satisfies the initial condition of the differential equation .",
    "this implies the addition of a term @xmath262 for an arbitrary vector @xmath263 .",
    "however , the vector @xmath197 can be fixed at time @xmath264 by imposing the initial condition . in this case , @xmath265 .",
    "if we define @xmath266 , and invert the quadratic equation , we obtain the final below :"
