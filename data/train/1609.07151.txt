    "within the nrqcd approach the hard modes , which require a fully relativistic analysis , are separated from the nonrelativistic soft modes .",
    "the dynamics of the soft modes is governed by the effective nonrelativistic action given by a series in heavy quark velocity @xmath5 , while the contribution of the hard modes is encoded in the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "the nonrelativistic action can be applied in a systematic perturbative analysis of the heavy quarkonium spectrum @xcite . at the same time",
    "the action may be used for lattice simulations of the heavy quarkonium states , which gives full control over nonperturbative long - distance effects @xcite . in the latter approach the inverse lattice spacing @xmath6 plays a role of the effective theory cutoff separating the hard scale @xmath7 and the soft scale @xmath8 , where @xmath7 is the heavy quark mass .    as an example , let us consider the spin - dependent part of the nrqcd lagrangian , which is responsible for the hyperfine splitting to @xmath9 .",
    "it reads ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the chromomagnetic field , @xmath12 is the @xmath13 color group factor , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are the nonrelativistic pauli spinors of quark ( antiquark ) field , and we have projected the four - quark interaction on the color - singlet state .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath17 parameterize the quark anomalous chromomagnetic moment and the effective local four - quark interaction , respectively .",
    "in the given order of the nrqcd expansion in @xmath18 they depend logarithmically on the effective theory cutoff @xmath19 . this dependence can be predicted to all orders of perturbation theory by renormalization group methods ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the radiative improvement of the action is therefore mandatory for the correct continuum limit .",
    "the effect discussed in this paper is characteristic for the quark - antiquark interaction and we focus on the wilson coefficient @xmath20 of the four - quark operator .",
    "it vanishes in the born approximation and is determined by matching the one - particle irreducible quark - antiquark scattering amplitudes in qcd and nrqcd .",
    "the matching becomes particulary simple when the amplitude is computed at the quark - antiquark threshold and vanishing momentum transfer . in this case",
    "the one - loop full qcd amplitude is @xmath21\\psi^\\dagger { { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}}\\psi \\chi_c^\\dagger { { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}}\\chi_c , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq::ampqcd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and we introduced a small auxiliary gluon mass @xmath24 to regulate the infrared divergence .",
    "the power enhanced @xmath25 term corresponds to the coulomb singularity of the threshold amplitude , while the term proportional to @xmath26 is due to the two - gluon annihilation of the quark - antiquark pair .",
    ".[tab::tab1 ] results of high - precision experimental and theoretical determinations of the bottomonium hyperfine splitting in mev . [ cols=\"<,<,^ \" , ]     let us now consider how the coulomb artifacts affect the determination of the energy spectrum from the lattice data .",
    "the results of nonperturbative lattice nrqcd simulations are typically given for @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the use of relatively large values of the lattice spacing ensures the suppression of the unphysical @xmath28 contributions , which become important at @xmath29 . at the same time it results in sizable coulomb lattice artifacts proportional to a power of @xmath30 .",
    "in addition the lattice data include the nonperturbative lattice artifacts which scale as @xmath31 and can not be removed through the matching procedure discussed above .",
    "to minimize these effects the results of the lattice simulations are numerically extrapolated to @xmath32 .",
    "the extrapolation below @xmath29 in this case is justified because the numerical effect of the @xmath28 terms on the data points is small .",
    "since the radiatively improved lattice result is supposed to be free of linear artifacts , the extrapolation is performed through a constrained fit of the data points by a polynomial in @xmath6 with _ vanishing _ linear term ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the correct treatment of the linear artifacts is therefore crucial for the extrapolation procedure .",
    "as it has been shown in the previous section by the analysis of the discretized schrdinger equation , the linear coulomb artifacts are absent in the bare lattice data .",
    "the contribution of the four - quark interaction to @xmath33 reads @xmath34 thus the linear coulomb artifact in the wilson coefficient obtained by the direct numerical matching @xcite results in s spurious linear dependence of the radiatively improved lattice data on @xmath6 , which leads to a systematic error in the extrapolation procedure based on the fit with the vanishing linear term . at the same time",
    "the wilson coefficient obtained by the asymptotic expansion about the continuum limit is free of the coulomb artifacts and provides the correct functional dependence of the radiatively improved lattice data on @xmath6 and therefore can be used for consistent extrapolation procedure .",
    "the numerical effect of the spurious linear artifact turns out to be very significant , see fig .",
    "[ fig::fig2 ] . the analysis of the hyperfine splitting @xcite based on the @xmath35 lattice simulations and the matching coefficient from eq .",
    "( [ eq::ds ] ) gives @xmath36 . at the same time the analysis @xcite based on exactly the same lattice data gives @xmath37 .",
    "the discrepancy between the results is mainly due to the spurious linear artifact and is well beyond the reported discretization / extrapolation uncertainty , which is below @xmath38  mev .",
    "thus the analysis of the hyperfine splitting in refs .",
    "@xcite contains a systematic error and should be corrected .",
    "the result of the direct numerical matching can yet be used for the self - consistent analysis of the quarkonium spectrum through the decomposition of the form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq::dsnum],[eq::delseries ] ) .",
    "after separating the logarithmic part , the result for the wilson coefficient should be fitted by a polynomial in @xmath39 and the linear term of the expansion should be subtracted . in the case under consideration only the @xmath40 term should be retained in @xmath20 .",
    "the further analysis follows ref .",

    "( [ eq::del0 ] ) substituted by the one from eq .",

    "this gives the central value @xmath41 , which is significantly below the result of ref .",
    "@xcite but in a very good agreement with the @xmath35 result of ref .",
    "@xcite given above .",
    "though the quadratic coulomb artifact is eliminated by extrapolation , it is instructive to estimate its contribution to the dependence of the lattice data on @xmath6 and corresponding uncertainty in the the extracted value of @xmath42 .",
    "the result of the fit for the hyperfine splitting can be represented as follows @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mass scale characterizing the approach of the lattice approximation to the continuum limit .",
    "numerically one gets @xmath45  mev for the @xmath9 and @xmath46  mev for the @xmath47 lattice action @xcite . on the other hand the quadratic coulomb artifact with the coefficient eq .",
    "( [ eq::delcoulomb ] ) corresponds to @xmath48 which gives @xmath49  mev for the values of the input parameters taken in the middle of a typical interval for the lattice spacing .",
    "though eq .",
    "( [ eq::lam ] ) is obtained in a simplified model with the coulomb hamiltonian and on a spherical lattice , we can conclude that the quadratic coulomb artifact to a large extent determines the dependence of the bare lattice result on @xmath6 and can be used as a prior for the constrained fit . as we observed in sect .",
    "[ sec::3.1 ] the effect of the lattice artifacts is enhanced by the relativistic corrections since the contribution of the higher dimension operators is more sensitive to the ultraviolet momentum region .",
    "this explains a slower approach to the continuum limit and larger discretization errors of the extrapolation based on @xmath35 lattice data .",
    "the smaller discretization uncertainty balances the larger relativistic corrections in the @xmath9 case and both actions provide comparable total errors .",
    "the best estimate is obtained as the weighted average of two results @xcite @xmath50 which is slightly above the @xmath35 result .",
    "hence eq .",
    "( [ eq::fin ] ) can be considered as an unambiguous and the most accurate lattice nrqcd prediction for the bottomonium hyperfine splitting available so far .",
    "in this paper we critically examined the matching procedure for the radiative improvement of the lattice nrqcd .",
    "we have demonstrated that the wilson coefficients of the effective four - quark interaction obtained by the widely used direct numerical matching suffer from spurious linear coulomb lattice artifacts , which result in a large systematic error in the predictions for the heavy quarkonium spectrum .",
    "this problem is solved by using the matching procedure based on the asymptotic expansion about the continuum limit .",
    "we also have shown how the direct numerical matching should be modified for a consistent treatment of the lattice artifacts .",
