    "hubble ( 1936 ) introduced lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies as a morphological transition class between ellipticals and early - type spirals .",
    "the lenticular galaxies have disks with luminosity ranging from ten to hundred percent of the bulge luminosity , but without any conspicuous spiral arms . from their appearance , and also their stellar content , they seem to be more like ellipticals rather than spirals , and have often been misclassified due to this fact .",
    "it has been suggested ( van den bergh 1994 ) that there could be different , but overlapping , sub - populations amongst the lenticulars .",
    "there are several scenarios possible for the formation of these galaxies .",
    "they could be of primordial origin , or could have been formed by the stripping of gas from spirals , which changes the morphology ( abadi , moore & bower 1999 ) , or through the mergers of unequal - mass spirals ( bekki 1998 ) . there could be a significant difference in the ages of disks and bulges , in which case they should have different stellar population , leading to different colors .",
    "bothun & gregg ( 1990 ) found that bulges and disks of lenticulars were well separated in the @xmath9 vs @xmath10 diagram which they interpreted to mean that the disks are younger than bulges by 3 - 5 gyr .",
    "but peletier & balcells ( 1996 ) found that the color differences between the disks and bulges are much smaller than those found by bothun & gregg ( 1990 ) , and inferred that the disks are only slightly younger than bulges , with the difference in age being in the range 0 - 3 gyr . in a study of 12 highly inclined lenticulars ,",
    "michard & poulain ( 2000 ) found that disks were often redder than bulges , which indicates that there could be large concentration of dust in the disks .",
    "a detailed multiband study of the morphology of representative samples of lenticulars , with possible separation of bulge and disk components , and comparison of their properties with those of ellipticals , and with the bulges and disks of spirals will be very important in addressing these and other possibilities .",
    "we have observed a sample of 34 lenticular galaxies in the optical and infrared bands , and present in this paper their surface and aperture photometry , together with color profiles and mean color gradients .",
    "we will in a subsequent publication present a decomposition of the surface brightness distribution of the galaxies into bulge and disk components using the decomposition technique developed by wadadekar , robbason & kembhavi ( 1999 ) . using the results of the decomposition",
    ", it should be possible to see where the lenticulars are situated relative to the fundamental plane of ellipticals ( see jorgensen , franx & kjaergaard 1996 and references therein ) and the photometric plane for ellipticals and the bulges of spiral galaxies ( khosroshahi , wadadekar & kembhavi 2000a and 2000b ) . with multiband data , it might be possible to determine in this manner the bulge - to - disk luminosity ratios of these galaxies in different bands , as well as the distribution of different colors as a function of distance from the center in the bulge and disk components separately , thus facilitating the comparison with other galaxy types",
    ". our data set will be very useful for detailed comparison with other galaxy types , as well as in constraining stellar population models for the lenticulars .    the present paper deals with the details of the sample selection , observations , data reduction and analysis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the selection criteria for the sample , details of observations and the technique used in data reduction are described in @xmath112 . the analysis and results from the surface photometry and aperture photometry are discussed in @xmath113 .",
    "the distribution of color gradients are discussed in @xmath114 and a summary of the results is presented in @xmath115 .",
    "an appendix contains comments on individual galaxies .",

    "is taken to be the point along the major axis at which the error on the mean surface brightness of the fitted ellipse reaches @xmath99 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "2 that plots of color against the logarithm of the semi - major axis for most of our sample galaxies , have a reasonably linear form between the inner and outer cutoff .",
    "there are some cases ( ugc859 , 1250 and 3087 ) for which the color profiles are non - linear between r1 and r2 because of the presence of a strong ring ( ugc859 , 1250 ) or an agn ( ugc3087 ) , which makes reliable estimation of the color gradient is difficult .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath5 color gradients for our galaxies are given in table 5 .",

    "the color gradients for lenticulars are more negative than the gradients for ellipticals , while the @xmath3 gradient for lenticulars is less negative than the corresponding gradient for bulges of early - type spirals .",
    "our steeper color gradients could imply that the metallicity gradients are stronger in lenticulars and/or that there is more recent star formation in the outer parts of lenticulars as compared to those of ellipticals .",
    "bothun & gregg ( 1990 ) reported significant differences in the colors of bulges and disks in lenticulars which they interpret as being due to age difference , and not metallicity difference , between the bulge and disk components .",
    "the large rms error in the mean color gradient of our sample could be due to the different colors of the bulge and disk components and varying proportion of these in different lenticulars .",
    "correlation between different color gradients have been noted by various authors ( peletier 1990a & b and idiart 2002 ) and have been used to derive information about the physical processes in galaxies .",

    "the plot of @xmath5 against @xmath2 gradients shows large scatter , and we do not see any correlation of the type reported by peletier ( 1990b ) , but it should be noted that they used only 13 galaxies to derive the correlation .",
    "it is necessary to investigate how the separate bulge and disk color gradients affect the total color gradients and hence the correlation between them .",
    "we will address in the future these issues using a bulge - disk decomposition technique which will allow us to study the color distribution in these components separately .",
    "in this paper we have presented detailed multicolor surface photometry performed with a ccd in the @xmath100 bands and a nicmos detector in the @xmath1 band , for a sample of 34 lenticular galaxies from the ugc catalogue .",
    "the galaxies were chosen in an unbiased fashion from a subset of ugc lenticulars as explained in section 2 .",
    "we have obtained total integrated magnitudes and colors for all the galaxies using elliptical annuli from surface photometry , and find that these are in good agreement with values from the rc3 catalogue . using isophotal analysis we have obtained radial profiles of the surface brightness , ellipticity , position angle , and higher order fourier coefficients in all the bands .",
    "the profiles in the different bands are consistent with each other , and any differences can be attributed to the presence of dust and other features which produce wavelength dependent effects . we have used the surface brightness profiles to obtain color profiles , and logarithmic color gradients , and find that the gradients are negative , indicating that the colors of lenticulars become redder towards the center , as is the case with elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have shown that there is good correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 color gradients for lenticulars .",
    "numerical profiles of all parameters that we have obtained from the isophotal analysis along with the color images are available at _ http://www.iucaa.ernet.in/@xmath79sudhan / s0.html_.    our intention in obtaining the multiband data on lenticulars has been to study in detail these galaxies as a class , and to compare their properties with those of ellipticals and early type spirals .",
    "an important aspect of this study will be the decomposition of the lenticulars into bulge and disk components and the comparison of these separately with the bulges and disks in other types of galaxies where these components occur with varying degrees of prominence .",

    "<S> , we obtain radial profiles of surface brightness , colors , ellipticity , position angle and the fourier coefficients which describe the departure of isophotal shapes from purely elliptical form and find the presence of dust lanes , patches and ring like structure in several galaxies in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain total integrated magnitudes and colors and find that these are in good agreement with the values from the rc3 catalogue . </S>",
    "<S> isophotal colors are correlated with each other , following the sequence expected for early - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the color gradients in lenticulars are more negative than the corresponding gradients in ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> there is a good correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 color gradients , and the mean gradient in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 magnitude per dex in radius respectively . </S>"
