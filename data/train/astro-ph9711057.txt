    "1992 ; da costa et al .",
    "1994 ; peacock & dodds 1994 ) , since these models could be accommodated in the then - dominant spatially - flat inflation scenario .",
    "however , an open inflating universe can also be created as a single bubble during the decay of an initial metastable inflation state ( gott 1982 , 1986 ) .",

    "the cmb anisotropy angular power spectra in the four models are of approximately the same amplitude . at smaller angular scales",
    "acoustic oscillations due to the pressure of the photon - baryon fluid and matter velocity perturbations at photon decoupling cause the angular power spectra to rise . at still smaller angular scales photon diffusion and the finite thickness of the last - scattering surface smears out the fluctuations .",
    "these effects give rise to the characteristic acoustic peaks in the angular power spectra on intermediate angular scales . in an open model the geometrical effect that the circumference of a circle is larger than @xmath39 times its radius moves these peaks to smaller angular scales relative to the spatially - flat case ( kamionkowski , spergel , & sugiyama 1994 ) . in the spatially - flat @xmath16 fcdm and low - density @xmath22cdm models ,",
    "the first acoustic peak is at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the amplitudes of the peaks in these models are different . in the open case",
    "the first peak is at @xmath42 , while in the reionized rcdm model the peaks are smeared out .",
    "consequently , the presence , location , and amplitude of the acoustic peaks are a valuable probe of the geometry and content of the universe .    in real observations and analyses ,",
    "the temperature fluctuations on the sky are convolved with the beam pattern of the experiment , and are often further smoothed to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "if the beam pattern is @xmath43 and the smoothing filter is @xmath44 , the observed cmb anisotropy temperature field is @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the coefficients of the beam pattern and the smoothing filter expanded in legendre polynomials , and we consider only harmonics higher than the dipole . assuming the idealized case of an all - sky data map , the inverse relation for the harmonic amplitude is @xmath48 for a gaussian beam ( or a smoothing filter ) with a width @xmath49 to a very good approximation , @xmath50    we use equation ( 1 ) to simulate the cmb anisotropy maps for map .",
    "we limit the summation to @xmath51 . for each cosmogony",
    "the real and imaginary components of @xmath33 are randomly sampled gaussian variates with zero means , and variances equal to @xmath52 for the @xmath53 harmonics and equal to @xmath35 for the @xmath54 harmonics .",
    "we adopt a gaussian beam with fwhm @xmath55 ( or width @xmath56 in equation [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the temperature fluctuations are then computed at @xmath57 points in ( @xmath58 ) space on a grid with @xmath59 spacing .",
    "the data from map is expected to include instrumental noise of @xmath60 @xmath61k per @xmath11 pixel .",
    "if the noise is white , its power spectrum is constant @xmath62 .",
    "consider a pure noise map convolved with a top hat filter @xmath63 with area of 0.09 square degrees .",
    "then the variance of the noise temperature fluctuation , which is set to @xmath64k@xmath65 per 0.09 square degrees , is given by equation ( 5 ) below ( at @xmath66 with @xmath35 replaced by @xmath67 ) .",
    "the top hat filter is @xmath68 for @xmath69 , and @xmath70 otherwise .",
    "the coefficients of its expansion into legendre polynomials are , for @xmath71 , @xmath72^{2n}.\\ ] ] we obtain from equation ( 5 ) @xmath73 for map .",
    "one can study the effects of noise on statistics using this noise power spectrum . in practice , of course",
    ", the map results will include an estimate of the noise at each pixel derived from the many observations taken as the satellite s horns sweep out complicated paths on the sky .",
    "the satellite horns are paired , so subtracting their signals gives the noise map ; this allows an extremely accurate characterization of the noise as a function of position on the sky .",
    "such a detailed noise map will allow a much more careful accounting of instrumental noise .",
    "( for example , the noise at the ecliptic poles is expected to be about half of that at the ecliptic plane ) .",
    "the maps resulting from the @xmath22cdm and ocdm models with simulated ( constant over the sky ) instrumental noise , projected according to the mollweide projection method ( snyder 1993 ) , are shown in figure 2 ( plate 1 ) .",
    "these maps are smoothed with a @xmath74 fwhm gaussian , which makes the total smoothing scale of the signal @xmath5 .",
    "the mollweide equal area projection shows the whole sky in a single map , but structures are distorted . in the topology study",
    "we use conformal stereographic projection maps where shapes of structures are preserved locally . stereographic maps of the cmb fluctuations simulated for the ocdm and @xmath22cdm models and convolved with a @xmath75 fwhm gaussian ( which makes the total smoothing scale of the signal @xmath76 ) are shown in figure 3 ( plate 2 ) . at this smoothing length",
    "most structures in the map generated by map will correspond to actual cmb anisotropy fluctuations ( see figure 8) .",
    "it is to be noted that the ocdm and @xmath22cdm maps are visually very similar  this is a consequence of the expected instrumental noise and smoothing ( see figures 1@xmath77 and 1@xmath78 ) .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this does not mean that map can not statistically distinguish between these models .",
    "differences between cosmological models are often displayed in terms of the angular power spectrum , as in figure 1 .",
    "most models have relatively small differences at large scales ( @xmath79 ) , but they often have relatively large differences at small scales ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the structure of the acoustic peaks at smaller angular scales depends on the cosmogony and the cosmological parameters . hence , to test cosmogonies and measure these parameters , it is essential to have an accurate measurement of the location and amplitude of the acoustic peaks .",
    "note that the acoustic peaks cause an oscillatory wave in the power spectrum ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the amplitudes of individual harmonics in the power spectrum are destined to fluctuate with respect to the mean . to measure precisely the amplitude and location of the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum",
    "one must make a fit over many harmonics .    an important integral of the power spectrum is the two - point auto - correlation function , the real - space fourier counterpart of the power spectrum .",
    "since the hot and cold spots due to the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum are compact in real space ( their size is fixed by the acoustic hubble radius at decoupling  see figures 2 and 3 ) , it is useful to explore them in real space .",
    "( note that in fourier space the peaks are well - approximated by a wavy sinc - function . ) while the correlation function and the power spectrum are simply related , it is useful to analyze data both in real space and in fourier space ( e.g. , hinshaw et al .",
    "1996 ; grski et al . 1996 ; wright et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the correlation function of cmb temperature fluctuations , corresponding to equation ( 1 ) , is @xmath81 here @xmath82 are legendre polynomials and we have ignored the monopole and dipole harmonics . the power spectra shown in figure 1@xmath83 can be approximated by an exponential minus a sinc - function .",
    "for example , the acoustic peaks of the fcdm power spectrum can be approximately described by the function @xmath84 .",
    "consequently , these acoustic peaks should appear as a negative top hat in the correlation function .",
    "figure 4 shows the correlation functions of the four models considered .",
    "thick curves are the correlation functions transformed from the power spectrum curves in figure 1 .",
    "thin solid curves , tracing the thick ones at large angular separations , account for the convolution with a @xmath85 gaussian beam in figure 4@xmath83 and with additional @xmath86 gaussian smoothing in figure 4@xmath77 . the acoustic peaks in the power spectrum indeed appear as a valley in this plot .",
    "the position , depth , and width of the acoustic valley depend on the model and the cosmological parameters .",
    "we have generated seven sets of @xmath87 s for the fcdm model , and have computed their correlation functions .",
    "these are also plotted , using dots , in figure 4 . at separations",
    "@xmath88 cosmic variance causes a large scatter amongst the seven correlation functions .",
    "hence it is very difficult to discriminate between models using large angular scale data alone .",
    "however , direct measurement from these realizations shows that the fcdm acoustic valley in the function @xmath89 is consistently located at @xmath90 , comparing excellently with the theoretically predicted fcdm acoustic valley location at @xmath91 for a @xmath85 beam ( and at @xmath92 in the unsmoothed map ) .",
    "the ocdm model acoustic valley lies at a smaller separation of @xmath93 ( @xmath94 in the unsmoothed map )  clearly distinguishable from the acoustic valleys of the fcdm and @xmath22cdm models ( some 13-@xmath37 difference for the fixed cosmological parameter values used here ) .",
    "on the other hand , the spatially - flat fcdm and @xmath22cdm models have acoustic peaks at nearly the same angular scales .",
    "therefore , they have to be differentiated by the amplitude of the power spectrum or the correlation function .",
    "it can be noted from figure 4 that the correlation functions of the fcdm and @xmath22cdm models are statistically significantly different at separations @xmath95 . in the case of an ideal sample with whole - sky coverage and with no noise , the map data would distinguish the correlation function of the fcdm universe from that of the @xmath22cdm case at the 2.6-@xmath37 level at angular separations near @xmath96 .",
    "note that this ignores the relative uncertainty between the dmr normalizations of the fcdm and @xmath22cdm models .",
    "the numerical value of this relative uncertainty is not known , however , the absolute model - dependent uncertainty in the dmr normalization is @xmath97@xmath98 ( in @xmath99 , the quadrupole amplitude of the cmb anisotropy , grski et al .",
    "also note that , for this comparison between fcdm and @xmath22cdm , cosmological parameters such as @xmath100 and @xmath13 are held fixed .    to estimate the effects of instrumental noise on the correlation function analysis of the map data we use the noise power spectrum , @xmath101 , derived above .",
    "this noise power is added to the cmb anisotropy signal , and the map is then further smoothed with a @xmath74 fwhm gaussian .",
    "that is , we generate a set of @xmath102 up to @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and @xmath105 , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the @xmath106 beam and @xmath74 smoothing filter , respectively .",
    "the corresponding correlation function is then computed . from seven realizations of the noise - added correlation functions for fcdm and ocdm",
    "the positions of the acoustic valleys are measured to be at @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the correlation function acoustic valleys of the fcdm and ocdm models are now 9-@xmath37 apart .",
    "it is also noted ( from figure 4 ) that the statistical uncertainty in the amplitude of correlation function at separations @xmath109 is hardly affected by the instrumental noise expected for map .",
    "this means that cosmic variance , rather than instrumental noise , dominates the statistical uncertainty in the correlation function at these scales .",
    "( this is also true for the genus statistic  see table 1 . ) therefore , the above argument on discrimination between the spatially - flat models on the basis of the amplitude of the correlation function remains essentially unchanged .",
    "the power spectrum and correlation function measured from the observed cmb anisotropy maps provides important information on the nature of density fluctuations in the early universe , thus constraining structure formation mechanisms .",
    "another important statistical characteristic of a cmb anisotropy map is whether or not its temperature fluctuation field is gaussian random - phase .",
    "one can test for gaussianity of the temperature distribution by constructing histograms of the pixel values . to test the gaussianity and phase properties of the maps the genus topology test is useful . in this section",
    "we study the topology of the cmb anisotropy isotemperature contour surfaces .",
    "this provides information on the global structure of the density fluctuation field .",
    "the genus has been used as a measure of topology of the matter / galaxy distribution . for three - dimensional topology",

    "the genus is the number of hot spots minus the number of cold spots , i.e. , at a temperature threshold level @xmath110 the genus is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the signed curvature of the isotemperature contours @xmath113 .",
    "the genus curve as a function of the temperature threshold level has a characteristic shape for a gaussian random - phase field . changing the shape of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum only changes the amplitude of the genus curve .",
    "hence the genus curve provides a good measure of both non - random phases and the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "the above real - space definition of the genus allows it to be directly used for studying the statistics of the acoustic peak hot and cold spots .",
    "previous measurements of the cmb anisotropy genus ( see references above ) were consistent with the gaussian random - phase hypothesis .",
    "the theoretical genus per steradian of a two dimensional gaussian field with correlation function @xmath114 is ( gott et al . 1990 ) @xmath115 where @xmath116 , and the threshold temperature fluctuation is @xmath117 . for a cmb anisotropy temperature map convolved with beam @xmath118 and smoothing filter @xmath63 , @xmath119 and @xmath120",
    "are given by @xmath121 where we have used the relation @xmath122 ( see equation [ 5 ] ) .",

    "the cmb anisotropy angular power spectrum is ( peebles 1982 ; bond & efstathiou 1987 ) @xmath125 we can estimate the slope of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum near the smoothing scale from the amplitude of the genus curve by using equation ( 10 ) and this formula .",
    "when the map data becomes available one can measure the genus of the observed cmb anisotropy and so constrain cosmological models and structure formation mechanisms .",
    "here we use our simulated cmb anisotropy maps to study the sensitivity of the genus statistic to models in the presence of instrumental noise and when the sky coverage is incomplete .",
    "we use the stereographic projection to map the cmb anisotropy sky simulations onto a plane .",
    "the stereographic projection is conformal and preserves local geometry . for a hemisphere",
    "the projection is defined by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the radius and @xmath128 is the position angle in the projected plane , @xmath77 is galactic latitude and @xmath129 is galactic longitude ( and should not be confused with the legendre polynomial index ) .",
    "figure 3 ( plate 2 ) shows such projections for the ocdm and @xmath22cdm simulations .    when computing the genus we exclude regions with @xmath130 to excise the galactic plane region where the galactic signal is likely to be important .",

    "comparing to the ocdm map with noise alone , we find that the point sources introduce an rms scatter in @xmath154 of 23 ( relative to the point - source - free map ) , significantly smaller than the typical uncertainty in @xmath154 , which is 42 in the map without point sources . we have also compared the genus values ( between the maps with and without point sources ) using the @xmath142 statistic .",
    "we find @xmath155 out of an expected 21 ( 21 @xmath110 values ) , confirming that the effect of the point sources on the genus is very small . since larger smoothing lengths would diminish the signal from point sources even further ( as with the noise ) , we conclude that the effects of the point - source foreground on the genus are small .",
    "galactic foregrounds , including warm dust and free - free emission , have been selected against in choosing the frequency coverage of map . at the optimum frequencies ,",
    "these foregrounds are expected to be nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the cmb anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , in the analysis of the dmr data ( bennett et al . 1996 ; grski et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) the @xmath0-dirbe 140 @xmath61 m sky map ( reach et al .",
    "1995 ) was used to correct for dust and free - free emission contamination , and the 408 mhz all - sky radio survey ( haslam et al .",
    "1982 ) was used to correct for synchrotron emission contamination .",
    "a similar approach , strengthened by new all - sky survey data , should ( hopefully ) suffice for dealing with these contaminants in the map data .",
    "another possible foreground is the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in clusters of galaxies ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) . here hot electrons compton scatter the cmb photons to uniformly higher frequency , introducing an apparent decrease in brightness temperature as great as @xmath156 mk on the few arc - minute scale ( for very massive clusters with a velocity dispersion of @xmath157 km / s , markevitch  1992 ) . at smoothing lengths of @xmath5 and higher , the effect is reduced to @xmath158k , significantly below the peaks in the cmb anisotropy ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "also , x - ray surveys of hot gas in the intracluster medium can be used to locate the massive clusters causing the shift , and to help estimate the expected magnitude of the shift ( e.g. , klein  1991 ) .",
    "( in the map data , the large sunyaev - zeldovich signal will come from the coma cluster ; this region can be excised from the analysis .",
    "this signal can also be estimated by projecting the thermal fluctuations out of the two highest frequency map channels .",
    "a combination of these cuts should be able to remove most of the sunyaev - zeldovich contamination from the map data . )",
    "non - gaussian features in the cmb anisotropy will affect the genus curve in many different ways .",
    "here we consider two cases that can be quantified .",
    "non - gaussianity can shift the observed genus curve to the left ( towards negative thresholds ) or right , near the mean threshold level .",
    "it can also alter the amplitudes of the genus curve at positive and negative levels differently , causing @xmath159 .",
    "the direction and degree of shift and asymmetry of the genus curve depend on the number , size and height / depth of hot and cold spots .",
    "we have computed limits on these non - gaussianity measures from our simulated maps . in the fcdm model",
    "we find that the map data will detect a shift of the genus curve near @xmath3 ( the five @xmath110 values in figure 5 centered on @xmath160 ) for @xmath161 for fwhm smoothing of @xmath162 ; the limits are the 2-@xmath37 error bars derived from the variances between fits for @xmath163 from the eight octants .",
    "the asymmetry of the genus amplitude near @xmath164 ( the five @xmath110 values centered on 1 and @xmath165 ) can be detected for @xmath166 at @xmath167 fwhm smoothing ( also 2-@xmath37 ) .",
    "the limits for @xmath168 and @xmath169 are very similar for ocdm and @xmath22cdm .      from figure 5",
    ", it is clear that the amplitude of the genus curves for fcdm and ocdm differ significantly .",
    "we first consider the genus amplitude for the case when instrumental noise is ignored . in the four cosmogonies considered , and in the scale - invariant power - law model , we expect from equation ( 10 ) a theoretical genus per steradian of @xmath170 ( fcdm ) , @xmath171 ( @xmath22cdm ) , @xmath172 ( ocdm ) , @xmath173 ( rcdm ) , and @xmath174 ( @xmath175 scale - invariant power - law model ) , when the total smoothing scale ( by the beam and the filter ) is @xmath176 fwhm .",
    "the uncertainty limits here account for cosmic variance , computed from actual realizations of @xmath87 s .",
    "note that these limits are computed from the galactic - plane - excluded maps . also , since the genus amplitude does not depend on the amplitude of the cmb anisotropy angular power spectrum , these results are insensitive to the uncertainty in the dmr normalization of the models .",
    "we have also computed the genus directly from simulated maps that include receiver noise , for a single realization of each model .",
    "( since all the model computations use the same random number seed , the cosmic variance effect is minimal . ) in figure 6 we have plotted these genus amplitudes at @xmath177 for the fcdm , ocdm and @xmath22cdm models . for comparison , we have also plotted the genus for the same cosmogonical simulations but now ignoring noise . in the inset , we have zoomed in on the values at @xmath178 and @xmath76 total fwhm smoothing , with 1-@xmath37 error bars derived from comparison of the fits to the genus values within each of the eight octants ( these error bars agree very well with the @xmath179 level , as expected ,  press  1992 ) .",
    "we have listed in table 1 the genus values , with statistical uncertainty and expected cosmic variance , from figure 6 .",
    "note that the @xmath5 column values are subject to finite pixelization of both the model map results and the projected maps ( melott et al .",
    "tests have shown that amplitude ratios between models remain very nearly constant when moving to higher resolution in the projected maps .",
    "hence , it is the finite pixelization of our simulations which ultimately limits the resolution for the genus computation .",
    "the three cosmogonies of figure 6 and table 1 have significantly different genus amplitudes , even when the expected instrumental noise is accounted for .",
    "they can thus be discriminated between on the basis of the genus amplitude .",
    "for instance , at the @xmath5 smoothing scale each model is distinguished from the other two at greater than 6-@xmath37 confidence ( table 1 and we have added all error bars in quadrature ) .",
    "( we again emphasize that the other cosmological parameters , such as @xmath100 and @xmath13 , are not allowed to vary in these models . ) these results may be directly compared to the genus measurements from map , as an independent check of the results inferred from the power spectrum and correlation function analyses .      in order to understand more completely the effects of receiver noise on the genus",
    ", we can look in detail at what is happening , structure by structure , when noise is added . at a high temperature cut ,",
    "for instance , noise can add a hot spot by adding a small amount of positive temperature to a region near the cut ; conversely , noise can remove a small hot spot by cooling a high - temperature region to below the cut .",
    "we have illustrated schematically in figure 7 the possible effects of noise on the genus . in figure 7@xmath77 and",
    "7@xmath180 the noise has neither added nor subtracted hot spots , leaving the genus unaltered . in figure 7@xmath83 , however , the noise has removed a hot spot and reduced the genus by one ; in 7@xmath78 the noise has split a hot spot into two and added one to the genus . in figure",
    "7@xmath181 the noise has added an artificial hot spot and one to the genus while in 7@xmath150 the noise has merged two hot spots into one and reduced the genus by one .",
    "these splittings and mergings can occur in higher multiples .",
    "we now examine our simulated maps for these effects . in figure 8@xmath83",
    "we have plotted the @xmath177 threshold mask for a subsection of the noiseless ocdm @xmath76 fwhm smoothed map . in figure 8@xmath77",
    "we have plotted the same mask , but for a map with noise added .",
    "several of the structures in figure 8@xmath83 become subdivided in figure 8@xmath77  noise has split hot spots .",
    "also , several new hot spots appear , while at least one cold spot ( in the upper right ) develops within a hot spot .",
    "to understand these changes quantitatively , we have counted the number of times each case in figure 7 arises for the ocdm simulations of figure 8 .",
    "results from this analysis are given in table 2 .",
    "table 2 shows that about 80% ( 660 out of [ 78 + 660 + 64 + 15 + 2 + 2 ] ) of the structures counted in the noise - free map correspond to exactly one structure in the map with noise .",
    "78 real hot spots occur with no corresponding hot spots in the map with noise , while 83 ( = 64 + 15 + 2 + 2 ) overlap two or more hot spots in the map with noise .",
    "very similar correspondence exists in comparing the noise - added map hot spots to the noise - free map hot spots , except in the `` 0 '' column .",
    "about a quarter ( 249 out of [ 249 + 683 + 13 + 2 + 1 ] ) of the hot spots in the map with noise had no corresponding hot spots in the noise - free map .",
    "this is to be expected because the noise adds artificial small - scale bumps on top of the signal .",
    "these bumps can push a pixel that was just below the threshold ( here @xmath177 ) to a value over the threshold , so that extra hot spots appear ( similarly , extra cold spots appear at @xmath182 ) . at @xmath76 fwhm smoothing about two - thirds ( 683 out of 1011 ) of the structures in the simulated map maps are due to real signal .",
    "therefore most @xmath76 scale structures in the map maps will correspond to real fluctuations in the microwave background .",
    "in this paper we have generated mock cmb anisotropy maps of representative dmr - normalized cdm cosmogonies appropriate for the map satellite experiment . we have studied the sensitivity of the simulated map data to cosmology , sky coverage , and instrumental noise .",
    "an accurate knowledge of instrumental noise is essential if the statistical tests considered here are to live up to expectations .",
    "we have focused on the correlation function and the genus statistic as tests of cosmogonical models . if the underlying theory has gaussian random phases , then these two statistics are just integrals of the power spectrum . however , since they are computed from the data in a very different manner than the power spectrum , they will be useful checks on power spectrum computations even in gaussian random phase models .",
    "the genus statistic will also be a powerful test of the random phase hypothesis .",
    "the correlation function statistic provides an accurate measurement of the acoustic hubble radius at decoupling from the simulated map data .",
    "the @xmath183 ocdm model considered here can be distinguished from the spatially - flat fcdm and @xmath22cdm models with more than 99% confidence from the location of the acoustic valley in the correlation function , even when the expected amount of instrumental noise is present .",
    "the fcdm and @xmath22cdm models can also be distinguished at separations @xmath184 by the amplitude of the correlation function .",
    "note however that for these models all other cosmological parameters ( such as @xmath13 and @xmath100 ) are fixed .",
    "the genus of the cmb fluctuations can also be accurately measured from the map data .",
    "the genus curves of gaussian cosmological models allow a 2-@xmath37 statistical horizontal shift of the zero - crossing point by only @xmath185 when the total effective smoothing is @xmath167 fwhm .",
    "the asymmetry of the genus curve at the positive and negative threshold levels is only @xmath186 in the gaussian cosmogonies considered .",
    "deviations of the observed map data that exceed these values will be evidence for non - gaussian behavior .",
    "the amplitude of the genus curve , which is a measure of the shape of the power spectrum at the smoothing scale , can also be a powerful discriminator between cosmological models .",
    "even with the expected amount of instrumental noise and partial sky coverage , the map data should discriminate between the cosmogonies considered here at confidence levels exceeding 99% just on the basis of the genus amplitude analysis .    of possible outcomes from the map experiment , a more interesting one would be if the results were in close agreement with the low-@xmath12 open - bubble inflation model .",
    "not only would this tell us the value of @xmath12 , but it would affirm inflation and support the open - bubble inflation model in particular , thus providing evidence that there are universes other than our own ( other bubble universes ) , all arising out of an initial metastable inflation state .",

    "<S> , map data will ably discriminate amongst the cosmogonies considered , and superbly determine the topology of the initial fluctuations .    a correlation function analysis of the simulated map data results in a very accurate measurement of the acoustic hubble radius at decoupling . a low - density open cdm model with @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> can be distinguished from the @xmath2 fiducial cdm model or a spatially - flat cdm model with a cosmological constant and @xmath1 with more than 99% confidence from the location of the acoustic  valley \" in the correlation function .    </S>",
    "<S> a genus analysis of the simulated map data indicates that in cosmogonies with gaussian random - phase initial conditions , the horizontal shift of the zero - crossing point of the genus curve near the mean temperature threshold level @xmath3 should not exceed @xmath4 ( 0.04 ) when the total effective fwhm smoothing is @xmath5 @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry of the genus curve at the positive and negative threshold levels should not exceed @xmath7 ( 4% ) at @xmath5 @xmath8 fwhm smoothing . </S>",
    "<S> deviations of the observed map data in excess of these small values will be evidence for non - gaussian behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the genus curve is a measure of the shape of the power spectrum at the smoothing scale . </S>",
    "<S> even with the expected amount of instrumental noise and partial sky coverage ( due to the galaxy ) , the map data should allow discrimination amongst the cosmogonies considered at more than 99% confidence solely from a genus amplitude analysis . </S>"
