    "the mechanism(s ) by which electrons and ions can exchange energy collisionlessly , that is in the absence of coulomb collisional coupling , have become important issues in a variety of astrophysical contexts .",
    "the fast solar wind provides an excellent laboratory to study such mechanisms in detail due to the relatively large amount data available . during its initial polar passes , in - situ observations from the solar wind ion composition spectrometer ( swics ) on _ ulysses",
    "_ revealed that the fast solar wind is more highly ionized than would be expected given the electron temperature and charge states spectroscopically observed in its coronal hole source regions .",
    "ulysses swics observed charge states related to electron temperatures near @xmath0 k , assuming collisional ionization equilibrium @xcite , contradicting the finding from sumer on soho which indicate electron temperatures near @xmath1 k out to a heliocentric distance of 1.5 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "for fe , temperatures of @xmath1 k in the freeze - in region would result in a main charge state of 8 + ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which is rarely observed in any substantial abundance in the solar wind .",
    "charge states in the fast solar wind for fe are typically near 10 + .",
    "hence , any heating mechanism for the electrons between   1.5 solar radii and 3 solar radii needs to explain the discrepancy between these sumer observations and the ulysses swics data .",
    "the fast solar wind is likely accelerated by ion cyclotron waves which damp by heating ions to high perpendicular temperatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in an initial analysis , @xcite pursued the idea that some of this energy `` leaks '' to the electrons in the solar wind acceleration region by a collisionless process .",
    "the increased electron temperature then further ionizes the plasma .",
    "the most likely collisionless mechanism appeared to be the excitation of lower - hybrid waves by ions ( most likely @xmath3-particles ) executing large gyro - orbits in a cross - field density gradient . in this way , the electrons are not heated until the ions develop large gyroradii , beginning at about 1.5 @xmath2 heliocentric distance .",
    "thus the observational constraint of @xcite of electron temperatures of around @xmath1 k out to 1.5 @xmath2 is not violated , which might not be the case for other means of electron heating .    while the existence of such density gradients is highly plausible from interplanetary scintillation observations ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the origin of these structures was not addressed . the turbulent cascade of mhd alfvn waves excited at the solar surface is known to be essentially 2d in character , proceeding much faster in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field than in the direction parallel to it .",
    "this means that direct damping of the alfvnic turbulence on ions is very slow , because the doppler shift , @xmath4 , is small and few ions are resonant .",
    "a possible solution to this lies in the inclusion of fast mode waves in the turbulence @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the cascade is not confined to the perpendicular direction and high wave frequencies are accessible .",
    "fast modes are also compressible , and more likely to produce the density gradients observed in interplanetary scintillation , and also invoked in this work to provide the instability that generates lower hybrid waves . in another approach ,",
    "@xcite suggest that the perpendicular gradients of density , magnetic field or velocity produced by the turbulent cascade then generates cyclotron resonant waves by a plasma instability , which provide the minor ion heating .",
    "we argue that a similar plasma instability should produce lower hybrid waves that damp on the electrons in the range beyond 1.5 @xmath2 . @xcite",
    "consider in most detail the velocity shear produced at the high @xmath5 end of the turbulent cascade , this being the most effective means of generating ion cyclotron waves .",
    "hence aside from being an interesting curiosity with interesting implications in various fields of astrophysics , our interpretation of the increased ionization of the fast solar wind in terms of small scale perturbations , in our case density gradients , may have an important bearing on the central problem of the acceleration of the fast solar wind .    in this paper",
    "we provide further analysis of _ in situ _ solar wind ionic composition data from _ ulysses _ , for fast wind from polar coronal holes , and the advanced composition explorer ( ace ) for low latitude fast wind streams .",
    "these measurements generally support the earlier results , though the degree by which the ionization is enhanced appears to be lower than previously reported .",
    "we also describe some refinements to the theory , which combined with the lower observed enhancement in ionization , make it plausible that the cross field density gradient required is the end result of the mhd turbulent cascade .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections 2 and 3 give some refinements to the theory presented in @xcite .",
    "section 2 considers ion heating by lower hybrid waves , and show that this is always negligible compared to the electron damping of the wave for solar wind conditions .",
    "section 3 discusses the electron distribution function arising from heating by lower hybrid waves , and shows both on theoretical and observational grounds that a maxwellian is the most likely distribution .",
    "section 4 presents new measurements of the fe charge states in fast solar wind from polar coronal holes observed by _",
    "ulysses _ and equatorial coronal holes observed by ace , section 5 gives some further discussion and section 6 concludes .",
    "in the model of @xcite , lower hybrid waves are excited by @xmath3-particle executing large gyro - orbits in the presence of a cross field density gradient .",
    "these waves are electrostatic ion oscillations with wavevectors concentrated in a narrow range ( typically @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electron and ion plasma frequencies respectively ) around the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "electron screening , that would normally inhibit the wave motion , is restricted for wavelengths greater than the electron gyroradius ( @xmath9 ) . since @xmath10",
    ", the wave can be simultaneously in landau resonance with ions moving perpendicularly to the magnetic field , and electrons moving parallel .",
    "hence a wave generated by a minor ion executing a large gyro - orbit may in principle be damped by ions ( most likely by protons ) as well as by electrons .",
    "ions may landau damp the wave , but above a critical wave electric field , @xmath11 @xcite , stochastic heating also sets in .",
    "we estimate the heating rates for ions and electrons as follows . the velocity diffusion coefficient for unmagnetized ions in electrostatic waves is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 6.43 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ratio of electric to total energy in the wave , @xmath14 is the number density of wave quanta with wavevector @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the wave polarization vector and @xmath17 is the ion velocity .",
    "writing @xmath18 we obtain @xmath19 following @xcite , the diffusion coefficient for magnetized ions in perpendicularly propagating electrostatic waves is obtained from this result by averaging over larmor angle @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 where we have assumed two resonances per gyro - orbit , i.e. the @xmath24 function is satisfied twice in @xmath25 .",
    "the heating rate is @xmath26 where the second step follows from writing @xmath27 , and integrating by parts in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "substituting the zero field ion velocity diffusion coefficient , the heating rate @xmath28 where we have put the wave energy density @xmath29 .",
    "the final step may be rewritten @xmath30 , where @xmath31 with @xmath32 is the ion landau damping rate ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* equation a12 with @xmath33 ) .    in nonzero magnetic field",
    ", we substitute equation 3 into equation 4 , and with @xmath34 , we get @xmath35 with @xmath36",
    ". the last form of the integral in equation 6 may be evaluated in terms of a whittaker function @xcite to give @xmath37 this is then evaluated using @xcite equation 13.1.33 ( p190 ) to give @xmath38 using limiting forms for the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath39 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equations 13.5.11 , p193 and 13.5.2 , p193 ) we finally arrive at @xmath40 thus in the limit @xmath41 , the magnetized ions are heated a factor of @xmath42 faster than the unmagnetized ions .",
    "@xcite gives a similar result ( page 504 ) , but his diffusion coefficient is different from our equation 3 by a factor @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the ion gyrofrequency . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the unmagnetized landau damping is a factor @xmath46 faster .",
    "the electron landau damping rate is given by equation a11 in @xcite as @xmath47^{-1 } { \\omega _ { pe}^2\\over\\omega _ { pi}^2}\\left(1+{\\omega _ { pe}^2\\over k_{\\perp}^2c^2}\\right)^{-1 } { \\partial f_e\\over\\partial v_{e\\vert}}\\left(v_{e\\vert}=\\omega /k_{\\vert}\\right)\\ ] ] which gives a damping rate of order @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath50 , this is @xmath51 faster than ion landau damping , and approximately @xmath52 faster than the stochastic heating rate for magnetized ions .",
    "we conclude that lower hybrid waves damp almost exclusively by heating electrons , and that the electric field in the wave may be higher than that set by @xcite .",
    "for ion heating to be significant , we require @xmath53 , i.e. the ions should already be significantly hotter than the electrons , but still in a `` cold plasma '' regime . the only qualification to this might be if the lower hybrid waves propagate at cosines @xmath54 so that @xmath55 .",
    "this seems unlikely , since even in the cold plasma case where lower hybrid growth rates and frequencies remain nonzero at @xmath56 , they are still lower than at @xmath57 , and so the existence of waves with nonzero @xmath58 and the consequent electron heating would seem to be inevitable .",
    "electrons heated by collisionless processes do not necessarily maintain a maxwellian velocity distribution function . in this section",
    "we investigate the effect of a nonmaxwellian electron velocity distribution function on the ionization balance of oxygen .",
    "the electrons are taken to be be heated into a @xmath59 distribution , @xmath60 .",
    "as @xmath61 , @xmath62 and a maxwellian is recovered . in appendix b we give a simple derivation of this form for the electron velocity distribution function from lower hybrid wave heating . in the case that @xmath63 , a @xmath59 function results , with the value of @xmath59 dependent on the wave electric field and the ambient density . in the opposite limit , @xmath64 , a maxwellian results , with quasi - thermal velocity also dependent on the wave electric field .",
    "based on our knowledge of coronal parameters , we would expect the latter case to be most likely for the acceleration region of the solar wind , where the ions are further ionized . in this section",
    "we show that the electrons in a maxwellian distribution function are also more consistent with the observed charge states than are @xmath59 distributions .",
    "we assume that the electron @xmath59 distribution is isotropic , mainly for ease of computation .",
    "we have @xmath65 so @xmath66 .",
    "the energy in the `` tail '' portion of the distribution function is @xmath67 .",
    "we write the temperature equilibration rate between the `` core '' and the `` tail '' as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the stopping time by coulomb collisions for fast electrons in cold plasma .",
    "we modify the ionization and recombination rates according to the departure from the maxwellian distribution function . in principle , the cross section for each process should be integrated over the @xmath59 distribution to evaluate the new rate .",
    "this is straightforward for direct collisional ionization and radiative recombination , but for the resonant processes of dielectronic recombination and autoionization following inner shell excitation , becomes considerably more cumbersome .",
    "instead , we approximate the @xmath59 distribution by @xmath70 which has been found by trial and error . we illustrate the comparison between the true and approximate @xmath59 distributions in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we then evaluate approximate rate coefficients by making the appropriate sum over maxwellian rate coefficients , and proceed with simulations in the manner described in @xcite .",
    "we keep the same definition of the electron - ion equilibration parameter , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the lower hybrid wave growth rate due to the gyrating ions , @xmath73 is the ion mass , @xmath74 is the ion abundance , @xmath75 the charge state fractions , @xmath76 the charge , @xmath77 the lower hybrid wave frequency , @xmath78 the wavevector and @xmath79 the ion gyration velocity .",
    "the ion - electron energy transfer rate is modified by a factor @xmath80 .",
    "this corrects an error in @xcite where only the electric energy density of the lower hybrid wave was considered in computing the energy transfer as @xmath81 , whereas @xmath82 should properly be the total wave energy density .",
    "thus for a given @xmath83 , the electron internal energy , @xmath84 , is the same in these models as in those of @xcite , multiplied by this correction factor of @xmath85 .",
    "each simulation is initiated with a high value of @xmath86 to enforce an initial maxwellian distribution close to the sun . after every time step",
    "in which the electron and ion temperatures and charge states are integrated , we update @xmath87 along with the other hydrodynamic variables in operator splitting fashion , according to @xmath88 and then update @xmath89 .",
    "this assumes that all of the electron heating goes to electrons in the tail .",
    "the coulomb equilibration between the  tail and the `` core '' is slower than the overall collisionless heating rate , and so @xmath59 decreases as the heating proceeds .",
    "table 1 gives values of the o@xmath90/o@xmath91 charge state ratio for models with varying @xmath83 , for initial wind flow speeds of 5 , 10 , and 20 km s@xmath92 .",
    "charge states are given for two cases , one with @xmath59 evaluated according to the procedure given above , and one with @xmath93 , i.e. a maxwellian distribution is enforced throughout as in @xcite . except in cases with the lowest values of electron - ion equilibration , a @xmath59 electron velocity distribution produces _ less _ ionization than the maxwellian distribution .",
    "with little or no electron - ion equilibration , the @xmath59 distribution has more electrons above the o@xmath90 ionization threshold than the corresponding maxwellian , and so higher ionization states result . at higher electron temperatures , many electrons are above the threshold in the maxwellian , and the @xmath59 distribution puts more of these at even higher energies , where the ionization cross section is starting to decrease .",
    "thus at high electron - ion equilibration rates , the @xmath59 distribution produces less ionization .",
    "we have previously identified these cases as being necessary to produce the observed degree of ionization , and so we conclude that at least in the region of the fast solar wind interior to freeze - in , the electrons are heated by lower hybrid waves into a maxwellian distribution function , as would be expected in the case that @xmath64 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "henceforward , @xmath93 is assumed in all models .",
    "the electron power law component observed by ulysses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) must be generated by another heating mechanism , possibly by lower hybrid waves further out in the solar wind where the magnetic field is reduced so that @xmath63 , or by the damping of whistler turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this conclusion is at variance with the assumption of @xcite , who argued that such a tail on the electron distribution should persist all the way down to the sun , based on the insensitivity to such an electron distribution of the electron temperature diagnostic used by @xcite .",
    "however , as discussed previously @xcite , other diagnostics exist which are sensitive to suprathermal electrons , and these generally reveal insignificant populations .",
    "such suprathermal electron tails are often attributed to the landau damping of kinetic alfvn waves @xcite , which if true , provides no obvious reason for the electron heating to be suppressed below 1.5 @xmath94 . by coupling the electron heating to the ion acceleration as in our model ,",
    "this constraint is automatically satisfied .",
    "the creation and destruction of an ion species is governed by the following rate equation for its density @xmath95 , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the electron density , @xmath98 is the collisional ionization rate , @xmath99 is the dielectric recombination rate , @xmath100 is the radiative recombination rate , and @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the solar wind velocity and radius .",
    "these the ionization and recombination rates depend on the local electron temperature and the speed of the ion .",
    "when the electron density is reduced by the expansion such that the last term dominates on the right hand side , the charge states are said to have frozen - in .",
    "depending on the element concerned , freeze - in occurs between 1.5 and 3.5 @xmath2 heliocentric distance .",
    "observation of in - situ charge states therefore allows the inner corona to be studied in detail .",
    "we examined charge state distributions of fe for a variety of fast solar wind periods using data we obtained from both ace and ulysses .",
    "the ulysses swics data has a time resolution of 3 hrs ( obtained via private communication , r. von steiger ) , while the ace swics data has a time resolution of 1 hr ( obtained from the ace science center ) .",
    "the coronal holes were identified by examining the solar wind speed , the o@xmath91/o@xmath90 ratio , and the c@xmath90/c@xmath103 ratio .",
    "the mean charge state distributions were calculated for the 2 @xmath104 4 day period when either ulysses or ace was in a high speed stream not attributed to icmes , but consistent with coronal hole solar wind .",
    "we examine three different types or cases of fast solar wind ; ( 1 ) four periods observed in a single well - formed solar minimum polar coronal hole , ( 2 ) four periods inside a single solar maximum polar coronal hole , and ( 3 ) 14 periods inside separate fast solar wind streams from solar maximum equatorial coronal holes observed at ace in 2005 .",
    "we will compare the observed charge state distributions with those predicted using various heating rates .",
    "figure 2 shows fe charge states observed in the fast solar wind by ulysses ( case 1 ) .",
    "there are six time periods , four days in duration , identified as wind originating in the polar coronal holes during the southern polar pass .",
    "the relative abundance of the charge states for these four day periods are averaged and plotted .",
    "the distributions tend to peak between @xmath105 = 10 - 11 .",
    "this is consistent with the finding of @xcite for the years 1994 - 1995 . a solution from the model with @xmath83 = 0.025 and an initial speed at @xmath106 of 10 km s@xmath92 ( the preferred value from * ?",
    "* ) is shown to closely match the observed distribution function .",
    "fe charge states for a variety of these models are given in table 2 , and @xmath83 is defined in section 3 .",
    "this demonstrates how lower hybrid wave damping can additionally heat the solar wind before the charge states freeze - in matching observations , and that only one characteristic density scale length is required .",
    "figure 3 shows the fe charge state distributions for a solar maximum coronal hole observed by ulysses swics .",
    "these four four - day periods occurred during the northern polar pass toward the end of 2001 . again",
    "the charge states represent the mean charge state distribution observed during these periods .",
    "the maximum charge state for this period is near 10 , although a large fraction remains in @xmath105 = 9 .",
    "these distributions are compared to a model with a heating rate of @xmath83 = 0.015 .",
    "however it is clear that the observed charge state distributions are broader than the model , indicating that a range of density scale lengths may be present .",
    "figures 4 and 5 show the fe charge state distribution for fast solar wind associated with an equatorial coronal hole observed by ace swics during solar minimum .",
    "for these plots , 14 periods are selected ranging from 2 - 4 days in duration .",
    "these periods represent different passes through fast solar wind , whereas the previous two examples represent different periods within the same coronal hole .",
    "the periods are separated into those that peak at @xmath105 = 9 ( figure 4 ) and those that peak near @xmath105 = 10 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the charge state distributions that peak at @xmath105 = 9 are fit best by a model @xmath83 = 0.01 , while the charge state distributions that peak at @xmath105 = 10 are best fit by a model @xmath83 = 0.015 , which implies more heating by wave damping is needed for these .",
    "the model results fail to catch the shoulder of the charge state distributions out to a charge state of 14 and beyond .",
    "since the ionization model assumes solar minimum conditions over the poles , there may be additional characteristics that need to be considered for a full understanding of the contribution of wave damping for the heating of ions in different solar wind streams from coronal holes .",
    "@xcite observed that the o@xmath107 outflow speed was lower for the equatorial coronal holes than for the polar coronal holes , despite the fact that their final solar wind speeds at 1 au are not significantly different .",
    "the wind acceleration must occur further out , possibly beyond the radii associated with freeze - in , leading to lower degrees of enhanced ionization .",
    "it may be that the higher densities in these structures prevent the plasma from becoming collisionless further from the solar surface than is the case in polar coronal holes , or that the increased magnetic field strength @xcite inhibits the turbulent cascade until the field has decreased sufficiently further out , since three - wave interaction probabilities go as @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "ulysses charge states from the solar minimum polar coronal hole during 1994 are observed to be higher than the charge states in the solar maximum polar coronal hole observed by ulysses in 2001 .",
    "the charge states in the equatorial coronal hole observed at ace in 2005 are even lower , with an average charge state of 9 + for fe .",
    "the trend toward lower average charge states correlates with the average of the solar wind speeds during the periods measured .",
    "the average speed of the solar wind alpha particles observed from the solar minimum equatorial coronal hole at ace was 650 km / s ( ranging from 600 - 800 km / s ) , while solar wind alpha speeds from the solar minimum polar coronal hole at ulysses were at 800 km / s + /-",
    "20 km / s .",
    "the wind speeds were more variable in the ace observations .",
    "the relationship of solar wind alpha speed and mean fe charge state and therefore lower hybrid damping rate indicates that less additional electron heating is needed in slower flows at lower latitudes .",
    "the electron temperatures required to produce the observed charge are slightly lower than was the case in @xcite , due to the small downwards revision of these charge states .",
    "we find the collisionless equilibration parameter @xmath83 in the range 0.01 - 0.025 , which corresponds to the curves labeled 0.2 - 0.5 in figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "this represents a small change , becoming a little more consistent with the observational error bars from @xcite .",
    "the cascade of alfvnic mhd turbulence from small to large @xmath5 is expected to produce cross field variations on small length scales of density , magnetic field and velocity . @xcite",
    "consider in most detail the velocity shear produced by perpendicularly propagating alfvnic fluctuations .",
    "such perturbations will also produce small scale perpendicular variations in magnetic field . while magnetic curvature may also give rise to lower hybrid waves , it is the longitudinal variation that is important in this respect .",
    "however @xmath58 does not cascade to large values , unlike @xmath5 , so we are left with cross - field density gradients as the most effective means of generating lower hybrid waves .",
    "significant density fluctuations can not arise solely from alfvnic turbulence .",
    "waves of a compressive character such as fast mode waves are required .",
    "@xcite , in an analytic consideration of three - wave processes involving two or three alfvn waves and at most one fast mode wave , show that a critical frequency , @xmath109 , exists , such that below this frequency fast mode waves dominate , and above alfvn waves are more prevalent . in the simplest case involving one fast mode wave and two alfvn waves , with one of the alfvn wave frequencies , @xmath110 , much lower than the other two , @xmath111 , putting @xmath112 in their equation 25 . for a density of @xmath113 @xmath114 and magnetic field of 1 g , @xmath115 which corresponds to a wave period of 90 s , assuming that in our case , fast mode turbulence must dominate up to frequencies corresponding to the ion gyrofrequency .",
    "waves of this period or longer are reported in coronal holes , @xcite , and so the existence of fast mode turbulence would not seem to be a problem . @xcite , adopting a numerical approach to consider a wider range of processes involving alfvn and fast mode waves , finds different regions of @xmath78-space dominated by alfvn or fast mode turbulence .",
    "@xcite conjecture that the degree of coupling between fast modes and alfvn modes should be reduced in strong alfvnic turbulence ; both @xcite and @xcite only consider weak alfvnic turbulence .",
    "slow mode waves have not been considered as part of the turbulent cascade , but @xcite discuss the behavior of slow mode solitary waves , which could also produce suitable density gradients in perpendicular propagation .",
    "direct evidence of turbulent cascade down to these small scales has been hard to come by .",
    "however cluster @xcite has observed electric and magnetic fluctuation spectra in the solar wind near the terrestrial bowshock . in the inertial range ,",
    "both spectra resemble a kolmogorov @xmath116 behavior .",
    "however as the dissipation range is approached , at @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the ion gyroradius , the magnetic spectrum steepens , while the electric spectrum flattens .",
    "clearly the turbulence is becoming more electrostatic .",
    "measurements of the phase speed suggest the turbulence is mainly alfvnic in nature , transforming to kinetic alfvn waves in the dissipation range and damping by heating the ambient plasma as the waves become more electrostatic .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the approach taken in this paper , except that the electrostatic waves we consider derive not directly from the cascading turbulence , but as a by - product of the damping .",
    "we determine a likely order of magnitude of @xmath119 from charge states observed in the fast solar wind . assuming a wave electric field given by equation a3 and a maxwellian distribution for the @xmath3 particles that excite the waves , we determine a density scale length @xmath120 from figure 11 in @xcite , where @xmath118 is the gyroradius of the @xmath3 particles .",
    "observations of @xmath3 particles in the solar wind typically give a @xmath59 distribution in the parallel direction with @xmath121 @xcite , which if it has an origin in energization by ion cyclotron waves would correspond to @xmath122 in the perpendicular direction .",
    "this would increase our density scale length estimate to @xmath123 .",
    "we showed earlier that ion heating is negligible compared to electron heating for lower hybrid waves excited under solar wind parameters .",
    "thus the electric field estimate in equation a3 may be exceeded by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "hence @xmath124 , and the density scale length becomes @xmath125 .",
    "we have no direct knowledge of the @xmath3 particle gyroradius .",
    "the perpendicular velocities for protons and o vi are @xmath126 and @xmath127 km s@xmath92 at a heliocentric distance of about 2 @xmath2 , where the magnetic field is @xmath128 g and the particle density is @xmath129 @xmath114 .",
    "the proton gyroradius is then 0.02 km , and the proton inertial length is 0.2 km . at 1 au , the minor ions flow about an alfvn speed",
    "faster than the protons , presumably reflecting enhanced perpendicular heating by ion cyclotron waves closer to the sun .",
    "the @xmath3 particles also flow faster than the protons @xcite , so we will assume an @xmath3 particle perpendicular velocity of 400 km s@xmath92 , similar to o vi .",
    "this gives an @xmath3 particle gyroradius of 0.08 km , and the range of density scale lengths corresponds to 0.8 - 2 km , or 4 - 10 proton inertial lengths .",
    "this is very similar to the scale length of velocity shear discussed by @xcite .",
    "thus it seems that our results support ideas of turbulent cascade of mhd fluctuations in the solar wind .",
    "other observations of density structures observed by interplanetary scintillation are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "another often cited mechanism for electron heating in the solar wind is the landau damping of kinetic alfvn waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by the small parallel component of the wave electric field .",
    "this process , and that for fast mode waves also , are considered in some detail by @xcite , with application to the formation of suprathermal electrons in the chromosphere .",
    "their solution of the dispersion relation only yields significant parallel electric fields for wavevectors approaching @xmath130 for both fast mode and kinetic alfvn waves . at @xmath131 ,",
    "the parallel electric field is a factor @xmath132 smaller than the perpendicular field , and smaller by at least an order of magnitude than the parallel electric field due to lower hybrid waves if the density gradients we infer above are related to alfvn or fast mode wavevectors .",
    "more generally , one can estimate the parallel electric field from the expression ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 37 ) @xmath133 which would suggest that wavelengths of order the proton gyroradius are required .",
    "this is less restrictive than the results of @xcite , but still significantly more so than what we determine for lower hybrid waves .",
    "it would appear then that electron heating by kinetic alfvn waves places even more stringent requirements on the turbulent cascade than do the lower hybrid waves .",
    "another potential problem is that no natural means of suppressing electron heating at altitudes within 1.5 @xmath2 heliocentric distance exists , which might lead to conflict with the sumer electron temperature observations of @xcite and others .",
    "we have revisited the model of @xcite for increased ionization in the fast solar wind with the analysis of new data , and some refinements to the theory .",
    "the important new development , due in part to the revision downwards of charge states observed in the solar wind , and more significantly to the correction of an error in @xcite in the expression for the wave energy density , is that the degree of density inhomogeneity required in the fast solar wind acceleration region to produce the required heating is now reduced from a length on the order of an ion gyroradius , to be in the range 10 - 25 gyroradii . as discussed above , this makes a connection between these density gradients and the outcome of the mhd turbulent cascade much more likely .",
    "our finding that ion excited lower hybrid waves develop stronger parallel electric fields than kinetic alfvn waves reinforces suggestions like that of @xcite that such mechanisms may have more general relevance elsewhere in astrophysics .    in our models ,",
    "the appropriate choice of the electron - ion equilibration parameter can yield a fit for the observed distribution functions for various fast solar wind streams .",
    "this supports the idea that existence of density gradients from mhd turbulent cascades can allow lower hybrid waves to oscillate and damp , imparting their energy to electron heating .",
    "this electron heating due to the damping of the lower hybrid waves occurs in the region beyond @xmath134 , where ions begin to execute large gyro- orbits under the influence of perpendicular heating by ion cyclotron waves .",
    "the solar wind flows with the highest alpha particle speeds also have the highest average charge states , implying that the electron heating is most efficient in fast outflow from polar coronal holes during solar minimum .",
    "lower fast wind speeds result in lower average charge states of fe , clearly indicating a connection between electron heating and ion acceleration . finally , in table 3 , we give predicted charge states for ne , mg , si , s , ar , and ca , again for an initial wind speed of 10 km s@xmath92 at @xmath106 .",

    "the equation of motion for a particle in the electric field of a wave is @xmath135 where @xmath136 and real parts are taken in the last step .",
    "writing @xmath137 we arrive at @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the particle trapping frequency .",
    "a particle is said to be `` trapped '' when @xmath140 during its cyclotron orbit .",
    "the time spent in the trapping region during a cyclotron orbit is @xmath141 where @xmath142 , so the time is @xmath143 .",
    "the trapping is defined as effective when the time spent in the trapping region is @xmath144 , so @xmath145 , which then gives @xmath146 which is the result of @xcite , derived by integration of the hamiltonian equations of motion .",
