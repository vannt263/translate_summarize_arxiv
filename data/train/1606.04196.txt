    ", biological systems comprise complex physiological processes , rendering their motion difficult to understand based on physico - chemical elementary processes . to address these disadvantages , physico - chemical systems are useful , as they are simple and easily controlled .",
    "a camphor grain floating on water , which diffuses camphor molecules around the grain , is one of the most studied physico - chemical self - propelled particles  @xcite .",
    "the camphor molecules act as surfactants and reduce the surface tension of the water ; the camphor grain is then driven by the surface tension gradient around it",

    "typical examples of the asymmetric systems are the systems that exhibit taxis under a certain gradient  @xcite . on the other hand , in a symmetric system , the motion emerges through spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "when the rest state becomes unstable , the motion appears to reflect the system symmetry , e.g. , translation , oscillation , and rotation , in isotropic , mirror - symmetric , and axisymmetric systems , respectively  @xcite .    a symmetric camphor grain , i.e. , a disk - shaped camphor grain , in a symmetric water chamber is classified into the latter case .",
    "when a camphor grain is located at the center position of a water chamber , it can stop because the force originating from the surface tension can be balanced owing to the symmetric profile of camphor molecules .",
    "however , a camphor grain at rest can be disturbed by the fluctuation .",
    "once the camphor grain begins to move , the asymmetry of the concentration field can be enhanced by the motion . in such cases ,",
    "the rest state is unstable , and the camphor grain continues moving .    in previous studies ,",
    "the switching of the rest state and the stable motion in one - dimensional infinite and finite systems were investigated . in a one - dimensional infinite system , a camphor grain",
