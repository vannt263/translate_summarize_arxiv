    "the lhc , as the highest energy collider ever available , is the best place to study double parton scattering ( dps ) ( or , more generally , multi - parton interactions , or mpi ) .",
    "this fact triggered several recent theoretical studies of dps .",
    "the theoretical understanding of dps is not yet complete .",
    "double parton distributions in the proton depending only on the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath5 of the two partons and the corresponding scales @xmath6 were introduced long ago , and evolution equations for these quantities were derived @xcite .",
    "however , more recently @xcite it was established that these quantities are not adequate to describe proton - proton dps ( although they may be used to describe the dominant contribution to the proton - heavy nucleus dps process @xcite ) . rather , one should describe this process in terms of two - parton generalised parton distributions ( 2pgpds ) , which aside from the momentum fractions and scales of the two partons also depend on the transverse impact parameter between the partons , @xmath7 . the work of refs .",
    "@xcite involved considering low order feynman diagrams and then generalising the findings to allow a resummation outwards from the hard process , whilst that of refs .",
    "@xcite was somewhat more formal in nature and laid down some first steps towards a factorisation proof for dps ( with refs .",
    "@xcite utilising the method of soft collinear effective theory , and refs .",
    "@xcite following the more traditional collin - soper - sterman approach )",
    ".    one important finding of the work in refs .",
    "@xcite was that there are ( at least ) two different types of contribution to the dps cross section , which are accompanied by different geometrical prefactors .",
    "one of these is the `` conventional '' or 2v2 contribution in which two separate ladders emerge from both protons and interact in two separate hard interactions  this one has been well - known for a long time @xcite and is the one that is often considered in phenomenological analyses",
    ". the other type of process is the `` perturbative ladder splitting '' or 2v1 contribution , which is similar to the 2v2 process except that one proton initially provides one ladder , which later perturbatively splits into two .",
    "the 2v1 contribution to the dps cross section has not received much attention in numerical studies , apart from one study @xcite that gives estimates of the size of the effect in four - jet , @xmath8 + 3j , @xmath9 and @xmath10 production .",
    "there may also be a 1v1 contribution to dps in which there is a perturbative ladder splitting in both protons , although there is some controversy in the literature over whether this process should entirely be regarded as single parton scattering ( sps ) , or if there is a portion of it that can be regarded as dps @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a sizable effect of the 2v1 ladder splitting process was observed for the processes studied there with a rather weak dependence on the kinematical variables .",
    "this indicates that the ladder splitting process may be important for other dps processes studied at the lhc .",
    "in this paper we will study the relative importance of the conventional 2v2 and ladder splitting 2v1 processes , for various processes whose production is dominated by gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "the representative examples are e.g. production of two s - wave ( @xmath11 ) or p - wave ( @xmath12 ) quarkonia , two higgs bosons and double open charm .",
    "the last process was studied recently by two of us @xcite .",
    "a cross section for the process was estimated and detailed comparison to experimental data obtained by the lhcb collaboration @xcite was made . even including higher - order corrections in the @xmath13-factorization approach some deficit of the cross section was observed @xcite , at least with the standard set of parameters .",
    "this deficit can not be understood as due to leading - order single parton scattering @xmath14 mechanism @xcite , and it is interesting to investigate if it can be at least partially due to the parton splitting contribution .    in the following",
    "we shall quantify the splitting 2v1 contribution for these processes and discuss its influence on the so - called effective cross section measured by comparison of the factorized model with experimental data .",
    "we generalize the formula for the total cross section from ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of differential distributions .",
    "since our focus is on the relative contribution from the 2v2 and 2v1 contributions , we will not consider any possible 1v1 contribution to dps ( the method by which one would calculate such a contribution within dps is anyway unclear at the present moment ) .",
    "effectively we are therefore following refs .",
    "@xcite and just taking such 1v1 processes to be pure sps .",
    "in this section we present a sketch of the formalism used to calculate the splitting 2v1 and nonsplitting 2v2 contributions to double quarkonium ( double higgs boson ) and @xmath2 production .",
    "various notations for calculating these contributions have been used in the literature  in the following we shall use the one from ref .",
    "@xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams_chichi ] we show the 2v2 and 2v1 dps mechanisms of production of two quarkonia or two higgs bosons .",
    "the first mechanism is the classical dps mechanism ( 2v2 ) and the other two represent mechanisms ( 2v1 ) with perturbative splitting of one of the ladders .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we ignore any possible contribution to dps coming from double perturbative splitting or 1v1 graphs , and focus instead on the relative contributions coming from 2v1 and 2v2 graphs .",
    "then , under certain assumptions , the leading - order ( lo ) cross section for the dps production of two quarkonia or two higgs bosons can be written in a compact way @xcite as @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 = 1 for two identical final states and @xmath18 = 2 for two different final states .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the independent ladder pair and ladder splitting double pdfs ( dpdfs ) respectively . roughly speaking ,",
    "the first gives the probability to find a pair of partons in the proton that was generated as a result of a pair existing at the nonperturbative level independently radiating partons .",
    "the second gives the probability to find a pair of partons that was generated as a result of one parton perturbatively splitting into two .",
    "we will give more detail as to how these objects are computed shortly .",
    "the key assumption needed to obtain is that the 2pgpd for the independent ladder pair can be factorised as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is normalised to 1 . since the two partons @xmath23 and @xmath24 are only connected via nonperturbative processes we expect @xmath22 to be some smooth function with a width of order of the proton radius .",
    "the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 in and are related to @xmath22 as follows : @xmath27 ^ 2 \\ ; , \\\\",

    ", width=302 ]",
    "in the present paper we have presented first quantitative estimates of the single perturbative splitting 2v1 contribution to double quarkonium , double higgs boson and @xmath2 production . in all cases",
    "we find that the splitting contribution is of the same order of magnitude as the more conventional 2v2 contribution often discussed in the literature .",
    "this is consistent with the observation made already in ref .",
    "the perturbative splitting contribution was not considered explicitly in previous detailed analyses of @xmath2 and pairs of the same - flavor @xmath39 mesons .",
    "our calculation shows that the parton - splitting contribution is not negligible and has to be included in the full analysis .",
    "however , it is too early in the moment for detailed predictions of the corresponding contributions as our results strongly depend on the values of not well known parameters @xmath26 and @xmath44 .",
    "both their magnitude and even their ratio are not well known .",
    "we have presented only some examples inspired by a simple geometrical model",
    ". a better understanding of the two nonperturbative parameters seems an important future task .",
    "we have shown that almost all differential distributions ( in rapidity , transverse momentum , even many two - dimensional distributions ) for the conventional and the parton - splitting contributions have essentially the same shape .",
    "this makes their model - independent separation extremely difficult .",
    "this also shows why the analyses performed so far could describe different experimental data sets in terms of the conventional 2v2 contribution alone .",
    "the sum of the 2v1 and 2v2 contributions behaves almost exactly like the 2v2 contribution , albeit with a smaller @xmath4 that depends only rather weakly on energy , scale and momentum fractions .    with the perturbative 2v1 mechanism included , @xmath4 increases as @xmath37",
    "is increased , and decreases as @xmath45 is increased .",
    "a decrease of @xmath4 with @xmath45 was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the same reason .",
    "similar trends were also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the calculation there is performed in a bfkl framework rather than the dglap framework used here . in ref .",
    "@xcite the decrease of the effective @xmath4 with @xmath45 is somewhat stronger .",
    "it is difficult to pin down the exact reason for this difference due to the different calculational frameworks used .",
    "however , we remark that the definitions of the 2pgpds and total dps cross section used in ref .",
    "@xcite would , in the dglap framework , allow some effective 1v1 contribution to dps , which here we do not include .    at present",
    "only the leading - order version of the single perturbative splitting formalism is available .",
    "however , it is well known that nlo corrections for the gluon initiated processes are rather large , also for processes considered here . in the case of @xmath2 production",
    "they can be taken into account e.g. in the @xmath13-factorization @xcite .",
    "it is not clear in the moment how to combine the higher - order effects with the perturbative splitting mechanism discussed here .",
    "an interesting question is whether the ratio between the 2v1 and 2v2 contributions changes when higher - order corrections are included .",
    "further studies are clearly needed .",
