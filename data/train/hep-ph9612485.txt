    "technicolor with scalars is a very simple and calculable kind of technicolor model , in which a scalar doublet with a positive mass squared is introduced to couple the technifermions with the ordinary fermions . when the technicolor interaction becomes strong and technifermions condense , this scalar develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , which breaks the electroweak symmetry together with the technipions .",
    "this scalar vev is also responsible for giving masses to ordinary fermions .",
    "it is very interesting that this model can be treated as a kind of low energy effective theory of strongly - coupled etc ( setc ) models  @xcite , when some degree of fine tuning is allowed .",
    "this fine - tuning is necessary in any workable setc model to maintain a sufficient hierarchy between the etc and technicolor scales  @xcite .",
    "some phenomenological issues have been explored previously in the literature and the model has been proved to be able to stand the experimental tests so far  @xcite-@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we consider the process @xmath2 in the hope of testing the model and constraining its parameter space further .",
    "the present exclusive limit on this channel from cdf , @xmath3  @xcite , is within an order of magnitude of the standard model ( sm ) prediction , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the cleo exclusive limit on the branching ratio ( @xmath5 ) is less stringent  @xcite .    in the sm",
    ", this process can only occur at loop level , and the error in the evaluation of @xmath6 can not be reduced to less than @xmath7 due to the uncertainties in quark masses and the interference effects from excited charmonium states  @xcite .",
    "still , given the large mass of top quark , one may expect this decay to be sensitive to new physics contributions , if these contributions significantly overwhelm the qcd uncertainties .",
    "therefore , the measurement of @xmath2 can provide a probe of the validity of critical ingredients of the standard model and , possibly , of the existence of new physics beyond .",
    "if the branching ratio does not lie significantly below the sm prediction , positive signals are expected to be observed with the upgraded cleo detector and in the cdf run ii even if its branching ratio is as low as @xmath8  @xcite . ] .    in section 2 ,",
    "we present the technicolor with scalars model .",
    "we then compute the @xmath9 branching ratio and discuss the results in section 3 .",
    "finally , in section 4 we give our conclusions .",
    "in the standard model , @xmath0 is dominated by one - loop contributions involving the exchange of a virtual @xmath10 and top quark ( see figure [ smdiag ] ) . in the technicolor with scalars model ,",
    "there exists at least one physical charged scalar , which can be exchanged in the loop into @xmath11 , because the @xmath11 coupling to the muon is small ( proportional to the muon mass ) .",

    "therefore , we need to know the mass of this scalar and its interaction with quarks .    -3.5em    -2.5em",
    "-3.5em    -2.5em    we will now give a brief summary of the model , focusing on the fact that we need to determine these quantities needed in our computation .",
    "for more details of the model , we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gauge group in the model is @xmath12 , with ordinary particle content the same as in the standard model . these ordinary particles are singlets under the su(n ) technicolor group .",
    "let us now consider the simplest case where there is a single weak doublet of technifermions @xmath13 where their hypercharges @xmath14 are chosen to cancel gauge anomalies .",
    "in addition to the above particle spectrum , there exists a scalar doublet , @xmath15 , @xmath16 which has hypercharge 1/2 .",
    "this scalar couples to the technifermions , as well as ordinary fermions .",
    "after the condensation of technifermions , because of the common scalar @xmath15 , ordinary fermions obtain masses .    the isotriplet scalar bound state of @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( technipions ) , and the isotriplet components of @xmath15 will mix .",
    "one linear combination becomes the longitudinal component of @xmath10 and @xmath19 , while the orthogonal combination remains in the low energy theory as an isotriplet of physical scalars , @xmath11 , whose coupling to quarks is  @xcite @xmath20.\\ ] ] here v is the ckm matrix , f is the technipion decay constant , and @xmath21 is the electroweak scale ( @xmath22gev ) ; @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are column vectors in flavor space ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 are yukawa coupling matrices .",
    "the above looks like the interaction of higgs doublet with quarks in a type - i two higgs doublet model  @xcite .",
    "the physical scalar mass can be estimated by the chiral lagrangian analysis  @xcite . at the lowest order , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the scalar vev , which is constrained together with f by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , is the average technifermion yukawa coupling of @xmath31 ( yukawa coupling to @xmath17 ) and @xmath32 ( yukawa coupling to @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xmath33 is an undetermined coefficient in the chiral expansion , but of order unity by naive dimensional analysis  @xcite .",
    "we set the value of it to be 1 , leaving its uncertainty in that of h since they always appear together when we work in the lowest order .",
    "the effective one - loop potential for the higgs field @xmath34 , which is the isoscalar component of @xmath15 , has the following form  @xcite , @xmath35\\sigma^4\\log{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu^2}\\right ) } -8\\sqrt{2}c_1\\pi f^3h\\sigma,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is an arbitrary renormalization scale .",

    "( i ) _ the limit in which @xmath40 is small and can be neglected ; and _ ( ii ) _ the limit in which @xmath41 is small and can be neglected .",
    "the nice thing of working in these two limits is that at the lowest order the phenomenology depends on the average of @xmath31 and @xmath32 not the difference of them .",

    ", we also set @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ shifted : mass ] ) . by using the shifted scalar mass , we can absorb radiative corrections which affect the phenomenology of the charged scalar .",
