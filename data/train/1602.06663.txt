    "the coupling of electrons or excitons to the phonon was completely neglected .",

    "the electron / hole - phonon interaction therefore seems to be non - negligible and needs to be considered thoroughly .    on the theoretical side ,",

    "this feature has been addressed in the one - dimensional case in which a linear relation between a square critical coupling @xmath88 and the phonon frequency has been confirmed both in numerical and analytical calculations  @xcite . in the case of @xmath89 , the ei / cdw",
    "state exhibits a finite lattice distortion . in the contrast ,",
    "i.e. , with @xmath90 , the system settles in a semi - metal state with an undistorted lattice structure .",
    "this semimetal ei / cdw transition is kosterlitz - thouless type , typically observed in general two - dimensional systems  @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig:1 ] indicates that our situation can be split into two different regimes characterized by the phonon frequency @xmath21 . in the adiabatic regime ( @xmath91 ) , for instance @xmath92 , the lattice displacement is larger than the ei order parameter , whereas in the opposite case , i.e. , in the anti - adiabatic regime ( @xmath93 ) the lattice displacement is smaller and goes more slowly than the ei order parameter .",
    "for that reason , the temperature effect on the ei / cdw semimetal transition needs to be discussed separately in both regions . in the following we focus on two typical values of @xmath21 , @xmath92 and @xmath94 .    in figure",
    "[ fig:2](a ) the ei order parameter @xmath85 and the lattice displacement @xmath95 are shown as functions of temperature for some values of @xmath30 at @xmath92 .",

    "this once more reminds us of the bcs theory in which the condensation of cooper pairs is driven by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the bcs type condensation of electron - hole pairs in the present problem will be discussed in detail in the remained figures .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath85 shown in figure  [ fig:2](a ) here fits quite well with the recent experimental observation in the quasi - two dimensional @xmath12-tise@xmath1 system  @xcite .",
    "that good description of the mean - field approach strongly indicates the macroscopic condensation of coherent excitons below the critical temperature . above the critical temperature",
    ", the strong fluctuations of incoherent electron - hole pairs would be significant  @xcite    in figure  [ fig:2](a ) we show also the lattice displacement @xmath95 evaluated for the same set of parameters .",
    "as in the ground state ( cf . figure  [ fig:1 ] ) , at finite temperature we still recognize the analogous behaviour of the lattice displacement and the ei order parameter .",
    "they simultaneously disappear if the temperature is larger than the ei / cdw transition temperature . below the transition temperature ,",
    "the lattice distortion occurs according to the stability of the exciton condensation .",
    "this temperature dependence of the displacement in the effect of the electron - phonon interaction has been discussed in the tight - binding approximation where the mean - field like temperature dependence of the ei order parameter has been assumed  @xcite . in our task both lattice displacement and ei order parameter are calculated self - consistently , i.e. , no manual form of them needs to be chosen at the beginning .",
    "the temperature dependence of the lattice displacement agrees qualitatively with extracted data from neutron diffraction experiments at low temperatures below @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "that once more confirms the validity of the mean - field approach at low temperature to study the lattice distortion induced by the ei / cdw state .",
    "similarly to figure  [ fig:2](a ) , figure  [ fig:2](b ) displays the temperature dependence of the ei order parameter and the lattice displacement for some @xmath30 values but in the anti - adiabatic case .",
    "in this situation the lattice displacement is always smaller than the ei order parameter in the whole range of temperature . in what below , we focus on the adiabatic regime to discuss the effects of temperature on the microscopic properties in our system . in the anti - adiabatic case we find ( not shown here ) the same physical scenarios .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the renormalized quasiparticle energy bands @xmath97 and @xmath98 along the diagonal direction of the first 2d brillouin zone , i.e. ,  @xmath99 , for different temperatures at @xmath100 and @xmath92 .",
    "note that we have chosen the semi - metallic situation meaning that in the non - interacting case , both @xmath14- and @xmath13-bands overlap .",
    "the fermi surface in this case is large and both types of quasiparticles participate to form the fermi surface . at low temperature",
    ", it shows us that a sufficiently large electron - phonon coupling triggers a gap opening at the fermi level .",
    "the opening of the gap indicates the bound state of the electron - hole pairs .",
    "this feature makes manifest the experimental observation in tmse@xmath2te@xmath3 that at large pressure , two @xmath7- and @xmath9-bands overlap . due to the phonon scattering ,",
    "@xmath7-holes couple to @xmath9-electrons to form excitons . at sufficiently low temperature , these excitons condense  @xcite .",
    "this once again reminds of a similar relevance to the bcs theory of the superconductivity where cooper pairs are formed .",
    "the width of the gap is proportional to the ei order parameter , which therefore decreases when enhancing temperature ( cf .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) . below the ei / cdw transition temperature electron - hole pairs are formed .",
    "whereas , above the ei / cdw transition temperature , large thermal fluctuations destroy the bound electron - hole pairs and the gap disappears . for a strictly 2d system , of course ,",
    "the critical temperature for exciton condensation would be zero , but the superfluid properties should survive for temperatures smaller than the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature  @xcite .    next , in figure  [ fig:4 ]",
    "we address the momentum dependence of the order parameter @xmath101 in the first brillouin zone for different temperatures at the same set of parameters given in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "note that besides @xmath85 , @xmath102 also characterizes the ei order parameter . for low temperatures and @xmath31 close to the fermi momentum",
    ", @xmath103 is strongly peaked , otherwise @xmath103 is a rather smooth function of @xmath104 . as a matter of course ,",
    "increasing temperature , the amplitude of the peaks goes down and it becomes insignificant if the temperature @xmath0 is higher than the ei transition temperature . at low temperature , fermi surface apparently plays an important role to form the electron - hole bound state , indicating the typical bcs - type of the ei stability  @xcite .",
    "+   +    to understand more about the temperature effects in the electron - hole bound state we now present the wave - vector and frequency resolved single - particle spectral functions associated with the photoemission or inverse photoemission ( injection ) of @xmath14 and @xmath13 electrons .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the variation of @xmath105 ( left ) and @xmath106 ( right ) for different temperatures @xmath0 as discussed in the last two figures following the high - symmetry diagonal direction in the brillouin zone .    at zero temperature ( see top panels )",
    "we find the gap feature opened at the fermi level ( see also figure  [ fig:3 ] ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath14- and @xmath13-electron states strongly hybridize close to the fermi energy with large spectral weight transferring .",
    "electron - hole pairs are therefore created and then condense in bcs type .",
    "the single - particle excitation gap is suppressed by increasing temperature ( see middle panels ) and completely disappears when the temperature is larger than the critical value ( see bottom panels ) .",
    "the gapless excitation at high temperature indicates that the bounding state of electron - hole pairs is broken . at high temperature",
    ", the system settles in the electron hole plasma state .    to analyze the dynamical properties of the electron - hole systems in the full range of temperature we discuss below a scenario of density of state ( dos ) . in figure  [ fig:6 ]",
    "intensity plots are shown for the dos of the @xmath14-band ( left panel ) and @xmath13-band ( right panel ) as functions of temperature at @xmath100 and @xmath92 . at high temperature",
    "the systems clearly show metallic state with nonzero dos at the fermi energy . lowering temperature , a correlation induced `` hybridization '' gap opens , indicating long - range order of the non - vanishing @xmath107 polarization and also the lattice displacement .",
    "a strong enhancement of the dos at the upper valence and lower conduction band edges due to the @xmath35-mixing state reminds us of a bcs - type structure evolving from a semimetallic state with a large fermi surface above @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic investigations of the system depending on temperature are in qualitatively good agreement with experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the excitons in the system are condensed in a bcs - like manner and give rise to a cdw state , characterized by the signatures of the ei order parameter and the lattice displacement as discussed before .",
    "to summarize , in this paper we have developed the unrestricted hartree - fock approximation adapting to the two - band electronic - phonon interaction model to address the influence of temperature on the excitonic condensate and lattice displacement in quasi two - dimensional systems . with an expectation that the electron - hole pair bound state",
    "might be formed at low temperature we have derived self - consistent equations permitting us to determine the ei order parameter and the lattice displacement .",
    "numerical results show us that , in the ground state , the ei stability and the lattice displacement are intimately related at large electron - phonon interaction . below a critical value of the electron - phonon coupling strength the system settles in the metallic state .",
    "that happens for both adiabatic and anti - adiabatic limitations . extending the calculation over a wide temperature range , we find a critical temperature at which the bound state of electron - hole pairs start to be completely destroyed by thermal fluctuations . by inspecting in further detail the momentum dependence of quasi - particle bands , the ei order parameter and photoemission spectral functions , we once more confirm the bcs type condensation of the electron - hole pairs at low temperature .",
    "in particular , the photoemission spectral function reveals a pronounced back - folding of the spectral signature in the ei state that directly makes manifest the transition forward a cdw state .",
    "analyzing the temperature dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath13 electron doss also exhibits the striking bcs type structure of the ei state evolving from a semimetallic state with a large fermi surface above @xmath96 . in this way",
    "our work has pointed out the prominent role played by the lattice degrees of freedom establishing a charge - density wave in semimetallic systems with weak ( indirect ) band overlap and in mixed - valent semi - conductors with band gaps comparable to the exciton binding energy , such as quasi - two - dimensional 1@xmath0-tise@xmath1 .",
    "the good agreement with experimental observations of our results strongly indicates that the unrestricted hartree - fock approach is applicable to consider excitonic condensation inducing the charge density wave state with lattice distortion .",
    "our work therefore gives strong support for exciton condensation as a purely phonontic mechanism responsible for the cdw phase in materials .",
    "combining with the electronic mechanism ( due to coulomb interactions ) to consider competition of the ei / cdw state and the lattice distortion will be left to the future .",
