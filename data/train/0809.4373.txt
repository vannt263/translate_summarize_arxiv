    "as the field of quantum chaos @xcite has emerged over the last few decades , much research has been directed towards the quantal counterparts of classically chaotic hamiltonian systems @xcite . amongst these systems , one - dimensional , periodically kicked quantum systems have proved a popular target for study .",
    "the dynamics of these systems , which are described by discrete time evolution operators acting over the period of one or more kicks , often display quantum resonances and antiresonances ; changes in the degree of localization of the dynamics which are strongly dependent on the value of an effective planck constant .",
    "advances in the cooling and trapping of atoms and ions has paved the way for substantial direct experimental investigation of such archetypal quantum - chaotic systems , particularly the @xmath0-kicked rotor @xcite , and also the @xmath0-kicked accelerator @xcite .",
    "another possibility is the @xmath0-kicked harmonic oscillator ( kho ) @xcite ; many kicked atom ( ion ) configurations involve trapping potentials which are to some degree harmonic , making the dynamics of the kho a relevant consideration for a wide variety of experiments .",
    "the classical kho was originally developed as a model for the interaction of charged particles with electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the frequency degeneracy of orbits in the harmonic oscillator renders the kam theorem inapplicable to the kho ( i.e. , all invariant tori of the harmonic oscillator may be destroyed at any finite perturbation strength ) @xcite . in cases where the kicking period rationally divides the natural oscillator period this allows the kho to display exotic non - kam chaos , manifest as interlinked regions of chaotic dynamics forming _",
    "stochastic web _ structures throughout phase space @xcite . the quantum kho has also been studied in considerable depth @xcite ; particularly in the case where it is kicked four times per oscillator period , when it can be related to the kicked harper model @xcite .",
    "depending on the relative alignment of the kicking potential with respect to the trapping potential , the kho can display either quantum resonances ( even kicking potentials ) or quantum antiresonances ( odd kicking potentials ) @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we consider the effects of quantum resonances that may be observed in an atom - optical kho . in section [ sec : aokho ] we outline our model of the atom - optical kho and introduce the kick - to - kick floquet operator . in section [ sec : origin ]",
    "we derive the structure of the quantum resonances and their effects on the dynamics .",
    "we consider the relation between the quantum resonances , the eigenstates of the floquet operator for @xmath1 kicks , and that floquet operator s expansion in terms of phase space displacement operators ; this leads to an alternative , physically intuitive explanation for the occurrence of quantum resonances . in section [ sec : manifestation ] we consider the measurable manifestation of quantum resonant dynamics in the atom - optical kho , including the experimental accessibility of the necessary parameter regimes .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] consists of the conclusions , which are then followed by three technical appendices .",
    "we consider a two - level atom ( or ensemble of noninteracting atoms ) or ion , subject to tight radial confinement and relatively loose harmonic axial confinement , and periodically driven by pulses from an off - resonant laser standing wave .",
    "we assume the pulse duration to be sufficiently short for the particle centre of mass displacement during the pulse to be negligible relative to the period of the standing wave ( raman - nath regime ) . to a good approximation",
    ", the excited internal state can be eliminated , and the system can be described by the one - dimensional single particle hamiltonian @xcite @xmath2 describing the centre of mass motion in the axial direction only . here @xmath3 is the particle mass , and @xmath4 the frequency of the harmonic trapping potential ; the kicks are pulses of duration @xmath5 , repeated with period @xmath6 , from the laser standing wave , detuned by @xmath7 from the two - level transition and with rabi frequency @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the laser wavelength .",
    "is therefore equal to two photon recoils . ]",
    "we have set the origin of the @xmath11-coordinate to be at the minimum of the harmonic potential , and choose the laser standing wave to be aligned symmetrically about this minimum .",
    "the resulting cosine potential is an even function in hamiltonian ( [ eqn : quantum_hamiltonian ] ) ; hence , we can expect quantum resonances , i.e. , particular parameter regimes associated with ballistic growth in the system energy , to be observable @xcite . shifting the standing wave by @xmath12 yields a sine potential  an odd function , producing antiresonances in parameter regimes where quantum resonances occur for a cosine potential .",
    "when the alignment of the laser standing wave with respect to the trapping minimum lies between these extremes , intermediate quantum resonant behaviour can occur @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not essential for the laser standing wave to be aligned perfectly symmetrically in order for quantum resonant behaviour to be observable , although from now on we assume this , for simplicity .",
    "more important is that any kick - to - kick variations in the standing wave alignment be negligible compared to the standing wave period , otherwise the resulting randomness introduced into the dynamics will destroy the desired quantum resonant behaviour .",
    "the time evolution of the quantum kho is described by a floquet ( discrete time evolution ) operator @xmath13 which maps the state of the system at a time immediately prior to one kick onto the state at a time immediately prior to the next .",
    "it is convenient to describe the floquet operator @xmath13 in terms of the harmonic oscillator creation and annihilation operators @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",

    "our intention here is to provide an accessible derivation of the conditions under which quantum resonances occur specifically for the atom - optical kho , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : aokho ] .    with this in mind",

    ", we now expand @xmath32 in terms of products of unitary displacement operators : @xmath46 taking the commutation relation for the unitary displacement operators @xmath47 @xcite , it follows that for @xmath48 , @xmath49 , then @xmath50 ( i.e. , the displacement operators commute ) whenever @xmath51}{q } \\right ) = 2\\pi w , \\label{eqn : master_resonance_condition}\\ ] ] for integer @xmath52 .",
    "if ( [ eqn : master_resonance_condition ] ) is fulfilled for all @xmath53 it follows that all displacement operators in ( [ eqn : ultimate_displacement_expansion ] ) mutually commute , and hence all of the product terms in ( [ eqn : q - kicks - q - axes ] ) must mutually commute . hence , under these conditions , the @xmath54th power of @xmath32 will describe a @xmath1-fold diffraction exactly equivalent to ( [ eqn : q - kicks - q - axes ] ) but with amplified kicking strength @xmath55 : @xmath56 / \\sqrt{2 } \\eta^2 \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eqn : many - kick - reduction}\\ ] ] this is analogous to the case where the quantum resonance condition is fulfilled for the quantum @xmath0-kicked rotor , when the free evolution operator between kicks collapses to the identity , and the evolution induced by @xmath54 iterations of the floquet operator is equivalent to that caused by a single kick with @xmath54 times the kicking strength @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath23 for which ( [ eqn : master_resonance_condition ] ) is fulfilled therefore determine when quantum resonances occur in the kho .",
    "in summary , ( [ eqn : master_resonance_condition ] ) is fulfilled for : all values of @xmath57 when @xmath58 ; @xmath57 equal to a multiple of @xmath59 when @xmath60 ; and @xmath57 equal to a multiple of @xmath61 when @xmath62 ( see appendix [ app : derivation ] ) . for @xmath63 it is impossible to satisfy ( [ eqn : master_resonance_condition ] ) . note that , for @xmath58 , ( [ eqn : q - kicks - q - axes ] ) reduces to being exactly equivalent to what one would expect for the quantum @xmath0-kicked rotor fulfilling the conditions necessary for quantum resonance ; the free evolution between kicks has no net effect , and the ( time - periodic ) dynamics can be equivalently described by a single amplified kick . however , the fact that the free evolution between kicks has no net effect is equally true classically ( for @xmath26 this simply means that after one oscillator period between kicks , the oscillator has returned to its original location in phase space ) , and one must therefore conclude that quantum resonances do not occur for @xmath58 , as is consistent with the dynamics independence of the effective planck constant @xmath23 .",
    "consequently the kho displays quantum resonances only if @xmath64 , and for @xmath57 equal to multiples of the principal quantum resonance values : @xmath59 when @xmath60 , and @xmath61 when @xmath65 or @xmath66 . at further rational multiples @xmath67 of the principal quantum resonance values ,",
    "commutativity between kicks depends on the value of @xmath68 in ( [ eqn : master_resonance_condition ] ) , and only occurs for some terms within the summation in ( [ eqn : ultimate_displacement_expansion ] ) , generating higher order quantum resonances . the proportion of terms for which the displacements commute decreases with the denominator @xmath69 , approaching zero as @xmath67 approaches irrationality .",
    "when @xmath64 , the set of unitary displacements in ( [ eqn : ultimate_displacement_expansion ] ) describe a two - dimensional crystal lattice in phase space . in analogy with section [ subsec : crystal_quasicrystal_symmetry ]",

    "coherent states are harmonic oscillator ground states which have been displaced in phase space , and as such can in principle be accessed by displacing an initial ground state in momentum ( e.g. , by application of a bragg pulse ) or position ( e.g. , by suddenly changing the trap minimum ) , possibly in combination with a free evolution subsequent to the displacement . in what follows we therefore consider the evolution of an initial coherent state analytically , which , in the case of quantum resonance , proves to be comparatively tractable .",

    "to observe , for example , the principal quantum resonance in the case where @xmath60 requires a lamb - dicke parameter of @xmath152 , and hence a suitable combination of harmonic trapping angular frequency @xmath4 and wavevector @xmath153 .",
    "this could be realized in a linear ion trap with relatively weak axial confinement , perhaps in conjunction with a standing wave formed by two counterpropagating laser beams overlapping at an acute angle .",
    "typical experimental configurations involving laser cooled alkali atoms within a magnetic trap yield much larger values of @xmath39 ; a configuration equivalent to that used by duffy _",
    "et al_.  would require a trap frequency of @xmath154 khz @xcite .",
    "such frequencies are nevertheless within reach of recent generations of magnetic chip traps @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a potentially quite flexible set - up could be achieved by generating the kicking field with a co@xmath155 laser ( wavelength @xmath156 ) . applying the kicking field directly along the axis of harmonic confinement , values of the lamb - dicke parameter around the principal quantum resonances ( e.g. , from @xmath157 up to @xmath158 )",
    "could be reached using trap frequencies ranging from 836 hz ( @xmath159cs ) up to 40200 hz ( @xmath160na ) , and introducing the kicking field at an angle to the trap axis would allow these frequencies to be increased .",
    "kicking strengths would be low because of the extreme detuning of the co@xmath155 laser , but the quantum resonances will still be manifest at any value of @xmath22 after a sufficient number of kicks .",
    "in this paper we have considered the characteristic quantum resonances occurring in an atom - optical @xmath0-kicked harmonic oscillator ( kho ) , a system in which typically alkali metal atom(s ) or an alkaline earth ion are trapped in an approximately one - dimensional harmonic potential and periodically driven by pulses of an off - resonant laser standing wave .",
    "we have demonstrated that the atom - optical kho displays quantum resonances dependent on the value of @xmath57 , where @xmath39 is the lamb - dicke parameter , equal to the ratio of the width of the ground state of the harmonic trapping potential to the wavelength of the laser standing wave .    when the oscillator is kicked a rational number of times @xmath161 per oscillator period , with @xmath1 equal to @xmath162 , @xmath163 or @xmath164 , quantum resonances occur . at these values of @xmath1",
    "the eigenstates of the floquet operator @xmath32 also possess a crystal phase space symmetry .",
    "we have shown that the quantum resonances occur at natural number multiples of a primary resonance value : @xmath102 in the case @xmath60 , and @xmath73 in the cases @xmath65 and @xmath66 . at these values of @xmath57",
    "all @xmath1 kicks within @xmath32 commute .",
    "further , secondary , quantum resonances occur for @xmath57 equal to non - integer rational multiples of the primary values ; at these values of @xmath57 there is a partial commutativity between the kicks constituting @xmath32 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the quantum resonances can be interpreted in terms of the relation between @xmath32 and its own eigenstates ; specifically , the quantum resonances occur when @xmath32 can be decomposed in terms of a set of displacement operators which is equivalent to the set of crystal symmetries of the eigenstates .",
    "we have also derived an expression for the time evolution of a coherent state in the cases @xmath165 by recasting the dynamics in terms of a mapping on a two - dimensional lattice of coefficients . at quantum resonance values of @xmath57 the evolution of these coefficients",
    "is greatly simplified ; we have shown that in this case there is a direct expression for all the coefficients at a given step .",
    "finally , we have considered the manifestation of quantum resonances in an atom - optical kho , in particular the ballistic increase in the mean energy associated with quantum resonances , and the quasienergy spectrum . to this end",
