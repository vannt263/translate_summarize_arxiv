    "accretion is generally through an accretion disk which is fed by roche lobe overflow of the companion .",
    "the transient outbursts are believed to be due either to an instability in the accretion disk similar to the thermal - viscous instability which causes dwarf nova outbursts in catacylsmic variables ( van paradijs 1996 ) , or to an instability in the companion s mass loss due to heating of its atmosphere by radiation from the x - ray source ( hameurty et al .",
    "many of these soft x - ray transient ( sxt ) outbursts are extremely bright , with one of the most luminous that from sax j1819.3 - 2525 ( v4641 sgr ) which reached an x - ray luminosity of @xmath10  ergs  s@xmath5 , or @xmath97 times the eddington luminosity for this 7  m@xmath11  black hole ( mcclintock & remillard 2003 ) .",
    "high - mass x - ray binary transient sources , on the other hand , are normally be / x - ray binaries in which a high magnetic field neutron star accretes from the circumstellar outflow of the be star ( verbunt & van  den  heuvel 1995 ) .",
    "there are two forms of outburst : type  i which occur near periastron passage in wide eccentric orbit systems , tend to recur for a number of orbits in sequence , and reach luminosities of @xmath12  ergs  s@xmath5 ; and type  ii which occur singly , may last for multiple orbits , and often reach the eddington luminosity ( negueruela 1998 ) .",
    "the most luminous observed outburst was from a  0538@xmath066 ( 1a  0535@xmath0668 ) which reach a peak luminosity of @xmath13  ergs  s@xmath5  in the 2 - 17 kev band ( white & carpenter 1978 ) .",
    "identifying luminous transients in other galaxies is rare because of source confusion within the host galaxy , the infrequency of x - ray observations of individual galaxies , and the relative faintness of even the brightest non - nuclear point sources in nearby galaxies .",

    "our resulting flux values are systematically lower than those obtained by steinle , dennerl & englhauser ( 2000 ) primarily because they assumed a power law with @xmath17 and intervening absorption column of @xmath18  @xmath4 , in their derivation in contrast to our bremsstrahlung model ( table  2 ) .",
    "a marginal detection in the 1994 august 10 observation was attributed to the weak nearby source seen by chandra .",
    "for the _ chandra _  observations , we extracted counts from an ellipse of half width 9  and half height 6  with a position angle dependent on the spacecraft roll at the time of observation .",

    "xmm - newton _  science analysis system - gui version 1.52.7 to process the epic mos and pn images .",
    "the position of the transient was determined with respect to the precise location of h13 ( turner et al .",
    "counts from the source and the background were extracted from a circle of radius 10  and a circular annulus of 10  and 20  radii , respectively , at the position of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312 in the 0.2  10 kev band .",
    "we show in figure  3 the combined 0.12.4 kev light curve of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312 .",
    "the source was bright during a 10 day period in 1995 july and in two observations seperated by 16 days in 1999 december ( see also table  1 ) .",
    "three months prior to the 1999 december observations , the source was detected but at less than 10% of the flux it attained in 1999 december .",
    "the source faded to below the detection threshold in all subsequent observations except during the 2001 may 21 acis / hetg observation where the source was detected at a flux of only @xmath19  ergs  @xmath4  s@xmath5 . for non - detections , we show 2@xmath20 upper limits in table  1 and figure 3 .",
    "transient black - hole binaries and transient be / x - ray binaries both show short term ( ms to ks ) variability . in black - hole systems",
    "the strength of aperiodic variability and the shape of the power - spectra are strongly dependent on the spectral state ( mcclintock & remillard 2003 ) . during the giant outbursts of",
    "be / x - ray pulsars the broad band aperiodic variability is often stronger than the pulsations , with strong low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations often appearing in the power spectra ( finger 2004 ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to quantify the short term aperiodic variability of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  and to search for coherent pulsations .",
    "we constructed short - term light curves of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  spanning individual observations and using the same extraction regions as described above to look for variability on short timescales .",
    "for example , the light curve during the 1999 december 5 _ chandra_/acis - i observation is shown in figure  4 .",
    "a total of 2264 counts were obtained in the 0.210.0 kev energy range , which were binned into 73 intervals of 500  s width .",
    "the light curve was steady during this observation according to a @xmath15 test against the constant count rate hypothesis ( reduced @xmath15@xmath210.995 ) .",
    "figure  5 displays the _",
    "chandra_/hrc light curve on 1999 september 10 . again using 500  s bins ,",
    "the unweighted average is 1.4 counts per bin .",
    "a @xmath91500  s flare occurred at the beginning of the observation , lasted through three consecutive bins , and contained a total of thirteen photons .",
    "a monte carlo simulation of a constant source with poisson noise showed a probability of 6.0@xmath22 for two successive bins in the light curve with a total of more than ten photons making it unlikely that this flickering is a statistical fluctuation .",
    "the light curves during the other observations are similar to these examples : a steady flux when 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  is at its brightest and flickering during fainter episodes .",
    "a power - spectrum analysis was conducted using event data from the 1999 december 5 _ chandra_/acis - i observation , but no excess power above the poisson noise was detected . the upper limit ( @xmath23 ) to a constant power spectra in the @xmath24  hz frequency range is 0.5 ( rms / mean)@xmath25  hz@xmath5 at @xmath26  hz . the upper limit for a zero - frequency lorentzian with half - power cutoff at @xmath27  hz is 2.6 ( rms / mean)@xmath25  hz@xmath5 at @xmath26  hz .    a search for coherent pulsations in the 3@xmath28@xmath29 to 0.154  hz frequency range was made in the 1999 december 5 _ chandra_/acis - i data , but none were detected .",
    "the search used the @xmath30 statistics ( buccheri et al .",
    "1983 ) with both @xmath31 and @xmath32 fourier terms .",
    "the arrival times used were referred to the solar - system barycenter using the ciao tool axbary with the de200 planetary ephemeris .",
    "we obtained a 90% confidence upper limit of 12% on the rms pulse fraction .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath30 are consistent with poisson statistics .",
    "( we note that this applies to simple pulse profiles limited to at most two fourier terms . )    a search for coherent pulsations with frequency up to 20 hz was made in the 1999 december 21 chandra hrc - i data .",
    "figure  6 shows the @xmath33 statistic calculated from the 481 barycenter  corrected events extracted from a 6  by 3  ellipse centered on the source .",
    "the peak value was 47.39 at a barycentric frequency of 13.264391(3 )  hz . to estimate the significance",
    ", we used a monte  carlo algorithm to generate 33800 simulated data sets of 481 events each .",
    "forty - seven of these data sets had peaks exceeding 47.39 in the 0@xmath020  hz range indicating the probability of seeing such a peak in any one spectrum is @xmath34 . to test for instrumental effects",

    "in figure 7 we show the epoch - folded pulse profile , which has an rms pulse fraction of 31% ( two fourier terms ) .",
    "the amplitude of the pulsations is only marginally increased by including a frequency rate term in the analysis .",
    "we measure a frequency rate of @xmath36  hzs@xmath5 .    we were unable to confirm these pulsations using the _ rosat_/hri data from 1995 july .",
    "these data , which consists of 820 events ( 37 being background ) , are spread non - uniformly over an interval of 10 days .",
    "these data are therefore very sensitive to small changes in frequency and therefore require a search in both frequency and frequency - rate with a large number of trial parameters .",
    "we used the @xmath33 statistic to search for pulsations at a frequency within 55 mhz of the chanda hrc - i detection , and frequency rate in the range of @xmath37 to @xmath38  hzs@xmath5 .",
    "the arrival times used were referred to the barycenter using the rosat ftools bct and abc .",
    "we find an upper limit of 27% for any pulsations in this parameter range .",
    "if pulsations were present with the same pulse fraction as seen in the chandra data , with pulse phasing that could be accurately described by a frequency and frequency rate in the search range , then it would have been clearly detected .",
    "the lack of detection could be due to a decrease of pulse fraction with decreasing energy , or the narrowness of the ranges of frequency and frequency - rate which was covered , which were limited by the amount of computation involved ( @xmath39 evaluations of @xmath33 ) .",
    "in particular we point out that we failed to cover the frequency rate of @xmath40  hzs@xmath5 observed for a  0538@xmath066 , and that the occurrence of a strong orbital modulation ( i.e. periastron passage ) within the data interval would have prevented detection .",
    "there are two _ hubble _  space telescope observations with 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  in the field of view .",
    "these observations were taken in 1997 july 27 ( mjd  =  50656 ; 195 days before the nearest x - ray observation on 1998 feb 7 , see table  1 ) .",
    "the observations used the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) with the f555w and f814w filters , respectively . both consisted of three 60  s exposures that were combined to remove cosmic ray tracks .",
    "we first located the globular cluster hghh-06 ( harris et al .",
    "1992 ; peng et al .",
    "2004 ) in the hst image , which gives an approximate correction to the hst coordinates . with this correction , the chandra source cxou  j132520.1 - 430310",
    "( kraft et al . 2001 ) lies very close to the bright object near pixel location ( 443 , 594 ) shown in fig .",
    "if we assume that this source is the optical counterpart to cxou  j132520.1 - 430310 , we can then derive a relative hst / chandra coordinate offset .",

    "this relative offset could be due to the blending of two objects in the f814w image .    correcting for galactic extinction yields an absolute magnitude @xmath45  mag and a color ( f555w  f814w)@xmath460.7@xmath470.8  mag .",
    "the absolute magnitude is consistent with that of a late o or early b main - sequence star . the extinction - corrected color is redder than that of main - sequence o and b stars ( _ cf . _",

    "this places 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312   at the low end of the distribution of luminosities observed among the class of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( fabbiano 1989 ; swartz et al .",
    "2004 ) and in the realm of luminous outbursts observed from several well - studied galactic and magellanic cloud x - ray sources ( liu , van paradijs & van den heuvel   2000 , 2001 ) ; primarily the ( high - mass ) be / x - ray binaries and the ( usually low - mass ) sxts .    many of the characteristics of 1rxh  j132519.8  @xmath0430312 presented here can be explained by comparison to either of these classes of galactic systems : 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  varied in flux by at least a factor of 1000 consistent with the range observed for both be / x - ray binaries and sxts ( which can be @xmath9@xmath51 corresponding to quiescent flux levels far below detectability of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312 ) . the spacing and duration of outbursts of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312",
    "are not well constrained because of the sparsely scheduled observations , but the interval of 4.4 years between observed outbursts and the @xmath92 week outburst durations are within the range of timescales observed in the galactic be / x - ray binaries and sxts .",
    "the peak luminosity of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312   is in the range observed for black hole sxts and within a factor of a few of the most luminous be / x - ray binary a  0538@xmath066 .",
    "the spectrum during the peak luminosity episode of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  is represented equally well by either a disk blackbody model like the high / soft or very high / soft state spectra of sxts or a cut - off powerlaw of accreting pulsars .",
    "note that , due to the low number of photons detected , the observations of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312cannot be used to detect the more moderate aperiodic behavior in the @xmath27 hz and higher range typically seen in sxts and in giant outbursts of be / x - ray binaries although violent variability at low frequencies can be detected .",
    "two characteristics of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  can best be explained only in analogy to the be / x - ray binaries .",
    "the detection of a potential optical companion to 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  with the brightness of a late o or early b star is just what is expected for a be / x - ray binary .",
    "for example , the companion of a  0538@xmath066  is a b2 iii - iv star ( charles et al .",
    "1983 ) and would appear to be 23.9 mag if it was in cen  a. more importantly , the coherent pulsations we have detected in 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  can only be explained in conjunction with a spinning magnetized neutron star .",
    "in fact , the period of 75.4  ms is remarkably similar to the 69.2  ms period of a  0538@xmath066  ( skinner et  al .",
    "this identification could be made more definitive if optical variability ( preferably correlated with changes in x - ray flux ) could be established and if the x - ray pulsations could be confirmed with another outburst observation ( preferably with _",
    "xmm - newton _  to also obtain another x - ray spectrum ) .",
    "in many aspects , we can not consider 1rxh  j132519.8 @xmath0430312 as a perfect analog to a 0536@xmath066 .",
    "this source reached a luminosity of @xmath52  ergs  s@xmath5 for only a few hours , during an outburst that lasted a few days .",
    "a later super - eddington outburst , lasted for 2 weeks , but showed an @xmath94 day e - folding decay ( skinner et al . 1980 ) .",
    "in contrast , 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  was surprisingly constant for 10 days in the rosat outburst .",
    "however , a  0538 - 66 does provide an example of a neutron star radiating far above the eddington luminosity .",
    "indeed , at the base of the accretion column the accretion rate per unit area must be super - eddington by a factor approching two orders of magnitude .",
    "it is the magnetic field of the pulsar which produces an efficient segregation of mass inflow and photon outflow that allows such super - eddington conditions to exist .",
    "the observations can be used to place constraints on the neutron star s magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field must be strong enough to channel the accretion flow near the stellar surface .",
    "for a 1.4  m@xmath11  neutron star of radius @xmath51  cm , a polar strength greater than 6@xmath28@xmath53  @xmath54 for a dipole magnetic field is needed to maintain the magnetosphere above the neutron star surface when the accretion rate is sufficient to produce a luminosity of 10@xmath55  ergs  s@xmath5 . at low accretion rates ,",
    "the magnetosphere can expand beyond the radius at which a keplerian orbit co - rotates with the neutron star resulting in material embedded in the field being flung off by centrifugal forces . in this `` propeller regime , '' accretion to the surface is inhibited ( stella , white & rosner 1983 ) .",
    "reduced levels of x - ray emission may occur due either to leakage through the lower centrifugal barrier near the spin axis , or due to accretion onto the magnetosphere ( king & cominsky 1994 ) .",
    "the transition to this regime occurs at a luminosity      where @xmath57 is the mass of the neutron star in units of 1.4  m@xmath11 , @xmath58 its radius in units of @xmath51  cm , @xmath59 its polar field in units of @xmath60  g , and @xmath61 its spin frequency in hz .",
    "the flaring during the 1999 sept 10 hrc - i observations could be explained by the unstable accretion expected during the transition to the propeller regime ( spruit & taam , 1993 ) .",
    "this would imply @xmath62  g for a 1.4  m@xmath11  neutron star and @xmath51  cm radius .",
    "1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  is classified as an ultraluminous x - ray source by virtue of its peak luminosity .",
    "how does 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  compare to the general class of ulxs ?",
    "during its peak brightness episodes , the x - ray properties of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  are within the broad range of values observed from other ulxs .",
    "for example , 30% of the ulxs surveyed by swartz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have power law indices between 2.0 and 3.0 ( although the average of the whole sample is only 1.7 ) and 86% showed no significant variability during times of observation .",
    "however , the fraction of ulxs that are _ transient _ has not yet been documented so we do not know how common this characteristic of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  is among the general class of ulxs .",
    "there have also been several reports of late o or early b star companions to ulxs ( e.g. liu et al .",
    "2005 ) like the candidate counterpart to 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312 .",
    "how common could be / x - ray binaries like 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  be within the ulx population ?",
    "a large number of be - type binary systems is expected in typical galaxies with modest star formation rates .",
    "for example , the population synthesis studies of dalton & sarazin ( 1995 ) predict @xmath220000 potential be - type binary systems exist in our galaxy based on the observed lyman continuum flux . in fact , most of the 130 known high - mass x - ray binaries in the galaxy and magellanic clouds are be / x - ray binaries ( liu et al .",
    "in addition , there is a strong correlation between ulxs and recent star formation in late - type galaxies .",
    "be / x - ray binaries are short lived and they are expected to be found in young stellar environments such as those in late - type and interacting galaxies .",
    "thus , the potential certainly exists for be / x - ray binaries to make a significant contribution to the ulx population , at least at the low luminosity end , and the ulx 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  may be the first such example .",

    "<S> the source is detected and varies significantly within three additional observations but is below the detection threshold in 7 observations . the x - ray spectrum in 1999 december </S>",
    "<S> is best described as a cut - off power law or a disk - blackbody ( multi - colored disk ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect an optical source , @xmath8@xmath924.1 mag , within the _ chandra _  error circle of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  in _ hubble _  images taken 195  days before the nearest x - ray observation . </S>",
    "<S> the optical brightness of this source is consistent with a late o or early b star at the distance of cen  a. if the optical source is the counterpart , then the x - ray and optical behavior of 1rxh  j132519.8@xmath0430312  are similar to the transient be / x - ray pulsar a  0538@xmath066 . </S>"
