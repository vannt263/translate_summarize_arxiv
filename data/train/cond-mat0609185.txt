    "quantum dots ( qds ) are very promising candidates for future implementation of quantum computations : an electron spin in a qd is a natural two - state quantum system , which can be efficiently manipulated by the external magnetic fields and gate voltages @xcite .",
    "also , the qd - based architectures are potentially scalable , and rely on well - developed semiconductor technology @xcite .",
    "however , due to interaction with the environment , the electron spin loses coherence very quickly , on a time scale of order of nanoseconds for typical gaas qds @xcite .",
    "it is vitally important for realization of qd - based quantum computing to understand the decoherence dynamics in detail , in order to find practical ways of decoherence suppression .",
    "moreover , decoherence of open systems is of fundamental interest for understanding of the quantum phenomena taking place in mesoscopic systems @xcite , and therefore attracts much attention from scientists working in the areas of nanoscience , spintronics , and quantum control .    among different sources of decoherence relevant for an electron spin in a qd ,",
    "the decoherence by the bath of nuclear spins ( spin bath ) is dominant for magnetic fields less than a few tesla , and experimentally relevant temperatures of tens or hundreds of millikelvin .",
    "much research has been focused on the case of a large external magnetic field or large bath polarizations , where the perturbation theory allows an extensive analysis @xcite .",
    "but the interesting and experimentally relevant regime of moderate magnetic fields and/or moderate bath polarization has received much less attention .",
    "below , we study in detail the influence of moderate magnetic fields and bath polarization on the longitudinal decoherence of a single spin in a quantum dot , and two spins located in neighboring qds , where the perturbation theory is not applicable . in this regime , as the magnetic field or the bath polarization increase , the dynamics of the electron spins undergoes a transition from simple overdamped decay to underdamped oscillations , and these oscillations can be detected using existing experimental schemes . in this transition ,",
    "the increase of bath polarization affects the decoherence dynamics in exactly the same manner as the increase of the magnetic field .",
    "our results also show that suppression of decoherence requires very large bath polarizations , suggesting that the use of such methods as dynamical decoupling @xcite , or control of the nuclear spins distribution @xcite , may be more practical",
    ".    theoretical description of the spin - bath decoherence is a very complex problem @xcite , where strong correlation and essentially non - markovian bath dynamics play an important role @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the well studied boson - bath decoherence @xcite , decoherence by a spin bath has not yet been understood in detail , especially in moderate external magnetic fields .",
    "an electron spin in a qd interacting with a bath of nuclear spins is described by the hamiltonian which includes the zeeman energy of the electron spin in the external magnetic field @xmath0 and the contact hyperfine coupling @xcite : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the operator of the electron spin , @xmath3 is the operator of the @xmath4-th bath spin ( @xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 is the contact hyperfine coupling which is determined by the electron density @xmath7 at the site @xmath8 of the @xmath4-th nuclear spin and by the land factors of the electron @xmath9 and of the nuclei @xmath10 .",
    "the terms omitted in the above hamiltonian , such as the zeeman energy of the nuclear spins , the anisotropic part of the hyperfine coupling , etc .",
    ", are small , and can be safely neglected at the nanosecond timescale , which is considered here .    in spite of apparent simplicity of the hamiltonian , it is very difficult to determine the dynamics of the central spin @xmath11 .",
    "previously , the quasi - static approximation ( qsa ) for the nuclear spin bath , which treats @xmath12 as a constant , has often been invoked @xcite .",
    "analytical calculations beyond the qsa have been carried out only for large magnetic field and/or large bath polarizations @xcite , where the perturbative approach is valid .",
    "although many qualitative arguments support qsa , its validity has not yet been checked in detail .",
    "below , along with explicit analytical solutions , we provide direct verification of our analytics by employing the exact numerical simulations for medium - size ( @xmath13 ) baths , and approximate simulations for large ( @xmath14 ) baths .",
    "the agreement between all three methods ensures us that our findings do not depend on the approximations involved .",
    "the analytical calculations within the qsa can be performed in different ways which all give the same results .",
    "the conceptually simplest way is to assume a uniform electron density in the qd , so that all @xmath15 are the same , @xmath16 , and the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the total nuclear spin of the bath .",
    "this hamiltonian can be analyzed exactly , since @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the integrals of motion .",
    "first , we consider an unpolarized bath , with the density matrix @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the unity matrix for @xmath4-th bath spin .",
    "this density matrix can be re - written in the eigenbasis of @xmath19 , @xmath23 as @xmath24 , the quantum - mechanical average of the @xmath25-component of the electron spin at time @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . due to the symmetry of the problem and the initial condition , @xmath31 , so we omit these components .",
    "the distribution function @xmath32 can be calculated @xcite and for large @xmath33 and @xmath34 it is approximated by a gaussian distribution @xmath35 where @xmath36 . replacing the summation by integration in eq .",

    "indeed , the noticeable average magnetization @xmath59 of the polarized bath leads to a noticeable average overhauser field , but the variation of the magnetization @xmath60 changes very little at small @xmath57 , and , correspondingly , the spread in the overhauser fields is almost unchanged .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rb ] ) and ( [ eq : rps ] ) , we see that @xmath44 always decays with characteristic time @xmath61 .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) , we reproduce a well - known result @xmath64 , i.e.  @xmath44 first falls to the value @xmath65 , then increases and saturates at @xmath66 .",
    "however , for @xmath67 ( or @xmath68 ) , due to the oscillatory terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wfunc ] ) , @xmath44 can exhibit oscillations , provided that @xmath45 ( or @xmath55 ) is comparable or larger than @xmath69 .",
    "this transition , from smooth decay at small field / polarization , to the oscillations at larger field / polarization , is similar to the well - known transition in the dynamics of a damped oscillator : the evolution of the central spin is overdamped ( or underdamped ) depending on whether the decay time @xmath70 is larger ( or smaller ) than the `` bare '' oscillation frequency determined by @xmath45 or @xmath55 .",
    "note that the crossover value for magnetic field ( polarization ) is of order of @xmath71 , beyond the range of applicability of the perturbation theory @xcite .    for a typical gaas qd with the electron",
    "delocalized over @xmath72 nuclear spins , @xmath73 @xmath74ev ( where @xmath75 mev is the hyperfine coupling for an electron localized on a single nucleus @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding decoherence time @xmath76 ns ( taking into account the @xmath77 spins of @xmath78ga , @xmath79ga and @xmath80as ) , as confirmed by recent experiments @xcite . to observe oscillations for a single electron spin , a very modest external field of order of 3 mt , or polarization of order of 0.5% is needed .",
    "it is noteworthy that the decoherence time remains practically constant in the course of transition from smooth to oscillatory decay . the decoherence time is determined by the spread in the overhauser fields , which is proportional to the variation of the bath magnetization @xmath60 , and it is little affected by small bath polarizations @xmath57 @xcite . for a moderate bath polarization , the equivalence between the external field and the nonzero bath polarization disappears , and the analytical expression for @xmath44 becomes rather complex , involving hypergeometric functions @xmath81 of complex argument , so we do not present it here . in this regime , the decoherence time does not increase much , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbp](e ) and ( f ) .    in order to substantially increase the decoherence time ,",
    "an extremely large bath polarization is required , as suggested by the results from the perturbation method @xcite .",
    "such a large bath polarization is beyond the scope of our paper . currently , strongly polarized baths are difficult to achieve experimentally , and such methods as narrowing the nuclear spin distribution @xcite , dynamical decoupling @xcite and spin echo techniques @xcite , may be more practical for suppression of decoherence .     but for @xmath14 nuclear bath spins in zero magnetic field ( a ) and in @xmath82 ( b ) with initially unpolarized bath.,width=312 ]",
    "the quasistatic bath approximation is far from reality .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the qsa predicts saturation of @xmath44 at 1/3 for @xmath83 , which is just an artifact of the approximation : the detailed analysis shows that @xmath84 slowly decays ( as @xmath85 ) to zero @xcite .",
    "however , we expect qsa to be valid at times of order of @xmath70 , when the bath s internal dynamics is not yet important .    for verification",
    ", we perform exact numerical simulation with medium - size baths of @xmath13 spins . a real qd is approximated by taking nuclear spins located at the sites of the @xmath86 piece of a square lattice , with the lattice constant @xmath87 . assuming a parabolic confining potential , the electron density is approximated as 2-d gaussian with the widths of @xmath88 , and with the center shifted by @xmath89 and @xmath90 along the @xmath91- and @xmath92-axis respectively .",
    "for comparison with the analytical results above , the effective coupling constant is defined as @xmath93 .",
    "the decoherence dynamics is simulated by directly solving the time dependent schrdinger equation for the wave function of the full many - spin system ( central spin plus the bath ) , using the chebyshev polynomial expansion of the evolution operator as described in ref .  .",
    "[ fig : rbp](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) show analytical [ obtained from eq .",

    "( [ eq : rps ] ) has been used , while the analytical curves in panels ( e ) and ( f ) have been calculated from the formula for moderate initial polarization .",
    "the agreement of the analytics and the exact numerics is good .",
    "the difference is caused only by the modest number @xmath13 of the bath spins used for numerical simulations , but exact simulations even for @xmath94 are beyond the capabilities of modern computers ( since the computation time and memory grow exponentially with @xmath33 ) .",
    "to study large baths with @xmath14 , we use the coherent state p - representation described in ref .  .",

    "the agreement between all three approaches is good , so we believe our results are applicable to real qds with millions of nuclear spins .",
