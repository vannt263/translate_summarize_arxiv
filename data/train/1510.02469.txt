    "there are many methods to identify repeats in sequences .",
    "some are based on the self - alignment of the primary structure @xcite and others implement spectral analysis of pseudo - chemical characteristics of the amino acids @xcite . since the same structural motif can be encoded by sequences that seem completely unrelated",
    ", it is not surprising that alignment - based methods fail to infer true structural repeats . the solutions to find inexact repeats in sequences @xcite include alphabet replacements using scoring matrices , sophisticated notions of sequence similarity based on an allowed percentage of mismatches , and elaborated mathematical representations such as hidden markov models .",
    "to a very large extent these solutions have been satisfactory .",

    "a mr is a block of amino acids that occurs two or more times and any of its extensions occurs fewer times . in case",

    "since protein sequences encode protein structures , we believe there must be a way to unravel the sequence repetitiveness despite the dissimilarity among the repeats .",
    "as we have seen previously , long stretches of perfect repeats are infrequent in natural proteins , even for those which are known to fold into structures of recurrent structural motifs .",
    "sequence - wise , repeats are known to be imperfect . unfortunately",
    ", the methods that assume repeats to be degenerated fail to make a complete detection .",
    "also these methods do not allow to conclude if some individual motifs actually occur or not .",
    "for instance , in anks , there are some specific sub - motifs that are characteristic of the family when looking at the statistical profile of ank repeats , as a tplh motif and variations of it ; however , when looking at particular individual sequences it is hard to say whether they correspond to ank instances or not .",
    "all possible variations of typical blocks should be represented in at least on member of the family .",
    "sequence statistical profiles , usually assume that positions are independent .",
    "therefore , when combining different amino acids at adjacent positions , blocks that are not representative of the family can be constructed , since natural covariations are not taken into account .",
    "the opposite , i.e natural occurring blocks that are a consequence of combinations of amino acids with low frequencies may not be detected as part of the motif .",
    "we overcome this problem by looking for natural occurring blocks in members of the family .",
    "this additionally solves the problem of position independence since these are implicitly used in the short repetitions .",
    "given a sequence @xmath3 and a family @xmath102 our method consists in finding the repetitions in the family @xmath102 that have some occurrence in the sequence @xmath3 .",
    "we first compute the sets @xmath103 , where @xmath37 is the concatenation of the sequences in @xmath102 separated by pairwise different symbols , for all the possible values of values of @xmath7 , namely @xmath7 goes from 1 to @xmath4 .",
    "we then compute the coverage made by the elements of @xmath103 on the sequence @xmath3 using the @xmath104 function .",
    "as example , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] presents the coverage of the i@xmath85b@xmath88 protein considering sets of mrs from different families .",

    "the coverage only keeps significantly high for longer mrs when using the set of mrs obtained from the ank family , to which the protein belongs .",

    "if this hypothesis can be generalized , we also applied the previous @xmath50 function to each of the 223 test sequences for which the protein structure is known .",
    "these test sequences include 73 anks ( ank@xmath82 ) , 50 dehs ( deh@xmath82 ) , 50 wd-40s ( wd@xmath82 ) and 50 randomly selected proteins that do not belong to the previous families ( het@xmath82 ) . for more details on how these sets were constructed",

    "these low values are a consequence of the low number of exact repeats in their sequence composition , regardless they belong to a repetitive or globular family .",
    "even when repetitiveness is evident at the structural level , sequences from repetitive and globular proteins are indistinguishable in terms of the covering done by their own mrs . on the contrary",
    ", we observed a clear difference for the familiarity values for these sequences when evaluated in the context of families .",

    "our hypothesis is that this high familiarity value is a common feature of protein families that are equilibrated ensembles whose members are mostly composed of exact repetitions ranging from dipeptides to decapeptides .",
    "this also suggests that natural proteins are built up from fragments longer than dipeptides but shorter than decapeptides , in line with the general ideas implemented by ` fragment assembly ' of synthetic proteins @xcite .",

    "we show that a large portion of each protein sequence can be described by short stretches of amino acids occurring in members of the reference family .",
    "thus , each family determines an expected covering of its sequences by family repeats .",
    "this yields a measure of likelihood for any sequence to belong to a given family , quantified by the @xmath50 function .",
    "this function actually provides a classification method for proteins in families .",
    "the method could be used as a guiding tool in the design of synthetic proteins , establishing a minimum and a maximum value of a candidate sequence in relation to existing families .",

    "this work is rooted in an exhaustive analysis of three natural protein families and two control families , taken as examples .",
    "the study can be extended to cover the complete protein universe or a substantial part of it .",
    "moreover , the approach does not require a detailed curation of the sequences present in the families .",
    "we have limited our current work to the identification of mrs in families and to the computation of the familiarity function .",
    "detailed statistical work remains to be done on mrs in families , such as the average distance between different occurrence of mrs inside the same protein sequence , the number of different mrs per length in each protein sequence .",
    "we also suggest to identify the subset of overlapping mrs ( and the size of the overlap ) , the subset of non - overlapping mrs , the subsets of mrs that can be placed one after another , and the subset of mrs that exclude the occurrence of others . these statistics may yield relations between maximal repeats with some known functional features and to some further conditions for the construction of synthetic proteins .",

    "<S> some natural proteins display recurrent structural patterns . despite being highly similar at the tertiary structure level </S>",
    "<S> , repetitions within a single repeat protein can be extremely variable at the sequence level . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a mathematical definition of a repeat and investigate the occurrences of these in different protein families . </S>",
    "<S> we found that long stretches of perfect repetitions are infrequent in individual natural proteins , even for those which are known to fold into structures of recurrent structural motifs . </S>",
    "<S> we found that natural repeat proteins are indeed repetitive in their families , exhibiting abundant stretches of 6 amino acids or longer that are perfect repetitions in the reference family . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a systematic quantification for this repetitiveness . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this form of repetitiveness is not exclusive of repeat proteins , but also occurs in globular domains . </S>",
    "<S> a by - product of this work is a fast classifier of proteins into families , which yields likelihood value about a given protein belonging to a given family . </S>"
