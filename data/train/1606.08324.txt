    "while the algebraic study of racks and quandles dates back to the early 1900 s , fenn and rourke in @xcite credit conway and wraith with introducing the concepts in 1959 as an algebraic approach to study knots and links in 3-manifolds . in the late 1900 s , several mathematicians began studying similar concepts under names such as kei , distributive groupoids , crystals , and automorphic sets . in 1982 ,",
    "joyce @xcite published a ground - breaking work which included introducing the term quandle , giving both topological and algebraic descriptions of the fundamental quandle of a link , and proving that the fundamental quandle of a knot is a complete invariant up to reversed mirror image .",
    "much of joyce s work was independently discovered by matveev  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we consider a quotient of the fundamental quandle of a link called the fundamental @xmath0-quandle , defined for any natural number @xmath0 . whereas the quandle of a link is usually infinite and somewhat untractable , there are many examples of knots and links for which the @xmath0-quandle is finite for some @xmath0 . in his ph.d .",
    "thesis , winker @xcite developed a method to produce the analog of the cayley diagram for a quandle .",
    "in addition , winker established a relationship between the @xmath0-quandle of the link @xmath1 and the fundamental group of @xmath2 , the @xmath0-fold cyclic branched cover of the 3-sphere , branched over @xmath1 . when combined with previous work of joyce",
    ", this implied that if the @xmath0-quandle of a link @xmath1 is finite , then so is @xmath3 .",
    "przytycki @xcite then conjectured that this condition is both necessary and sufficient , which we prove to be true in this paper .",
    "our proof involves first generalizing a key result of joyce : the cosets of the peripheral subgroup of a knot group can be given a quandle structure making it isomorphic to the fundamental quandle of the knot .",
    "we extend this result to the @xmath0-quandle of a knot , showing that it can also be viewed as the set of cosets of the peripheral subgroup in a certain quotient of the knot group .",
    "this result allows winker s diagraming method to be replaced by the well known todd - coxeter method of coset enumeration .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with the theory of racks and quandles , but include basic definitions for completeness .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for more information .",
    "a _ quandle _ is a set @xmath4 together with two binary operations @xmath5 and @xmath6 which satisfies the following three axioms .",
    "* @xmath7 for all @xmath8 . * @xmath9 for all @xmath10 .",
    "* @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "a _ rack _ is more general , requiring only q2 and q3 .",
    "it is important to note that , in general , the quandle operations are not associative .",
    "in fact , using axioms q2 and q3 it is easy to show that @xmath13 this property allows one to write any expression involving @xmath5 and @xmath6 in a unique left - associated form ( see @xcite ) .",
    "henceforth , expressions without parenthesis are assumed to be left - associated .    given a quandle @xmath4 , each element",
    "@xmath14 defines a map @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "it follows from axiom q2 that @xmath17 is a bijection and @xmath18 . from axiom q3",
    ", it follows that @xmath17 is a quandle homomorphism .",
    "the automorphism @xmath17 is called the _ point symmetry at @xmath19 _ and the set of all point symmetries generate the _ inner automorphism group _ @xmath20 .",
    "a quandle @xmath4 is _ algebraically connected _ if @xmath20 acts transitively on @xmath4 .",
    "an _ algebraic component _ of @xmath4 is a maximal algebraically connected subset of @xmath4 .    in @xcite , joyce defines two functors from the category of groups to the category of quandles .",
    "these functors and their adjoints will be of importance in this paper .",
    "the first , denoted @xmath21 , takes a group @xmath22 to a quandle @xmath23 defined as the set @xmath22 with operations given by conjugation .",
    "specifically , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "its adjoint , denoted @xmath26 takes the quandle @xmath4 to the group @xmath27 generated by the elements of @xmath4 and defined by the group presentation @xmath28    a quandle @xmath4 is called an _ @xmath0-quandle _ if each point symmetry @xmath17 has order dividing @xmath0 .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath29 for @xmath30 , the @xmath31-th power of @xmath32 evaluated at @xmath33 .",
    "thus @xmath4 is an @xmath0-quandle if for all @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath4 , we have @xmath35 . a second functor from groups to @xmath0-quandles is defined for each natural number @xmath0 and is denoted @xmath36 . given a group @xmath22",
    ", the @xmath0-quandle @xmath37 is the set @xmath38 again with the operations given by conjugation .",
    "the adjoint of this functor is @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath4 is any @xmath0-quandle , the group @xmath40 is defined by the presentation @xmath41    quandles may be presented in terms of generators and relators in much the same way as groups .",
    "see @xcite for a rigorous development of this topic .",
    "if the quandle @xmath4 is given by the finite presentation @xmath42 then winker proves in @xcite that @xmath27 and @xmath40 can be finitely presented as @xmath43 and @xmath44 here , each quandle relation @xmath45 is an equation between two quandle elements each expressed using the generators , the operations @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and parenthesis to indicate the order of operations .",
    "the associated group relation @xmath46 must now be formed in a corresponding way using conjugation .",
    "for example , if @xmath47 is the quandle relation @xmath48 , then @xmath49 is the relation @xmath50 .",
    "associated to every oriented knot or link @xmath1 in the 3-sphere @xmath51 is its _ fundamental quandle _",
    "@xmath52 which is defined by means of a presentation derived from a regular diagram @xmath53 of @xmath1 with @xmath54 arcs and @xmath55 crossings .",
    "first assign quandle generators @xmath56 to each arc of @xmath53 .",
    "next , introduce a relation @xmath57 at each crossing of @xmath53 as shown in figure  [ crossing relation ] .",
    "it is easy to check that the three axioms , q1 , q2 , and q3 , are exactly what is needed to prove that @xmath52 is preserved by reidemeister moves and hence is an invariant of the link . passing from this presentation @xmath58 to a presentation for @xmath59 by using winker s formula  , we obtain the well - known wirtinger presentation of @xmath60 .",
    "thus for any link @xmath1 , @xmath61 .     is associated to a crossing with arcs labeled as shown . ]",
    "joyce proves in @xcite that @xmath52 is a complete invariant of knots up to reverse mirror image .",
    "a less sensitive , but presumably more tractable , invariant is the _ fundamental @xmath0-quandle _ @xmath62 which can be defined for each natural number @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath58 is the presentation of the fundamental quandle of @xmath1 given by a diagram @xmath53 and @xmath0 is a fixed natural number , then the fundamental @xmath0-quandle of @xmath1 is defined to be the quandle with presentation @xmath63 where the relations @xmath64 are of the form @xmath65 for all distinct pairs of generators @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "as before , it is easy to check that @xmath62 is an invariant of @xmath1 and moreover that it is an @xmath0-quandle . passing from this presentation of @xmath62 to a presentation for @xmath68 by using winker s formula  , we see that @xmath68 is a quotient of @xmath59",
    ". in particular , we may present @xmath68 by starting with the wirtinger presentation of @xmath60 and then adjoining the relations @xmath69 for each wirtinger generator @xmath33 . while the fundamental quandle of a nontrivial knot is always infinite ,",
    "the associated @xmath0-quandle is sometimes finite .",
    "determining when this occurs is the focus of this paper .",
    "if @xmath1 is a link of more than one component , then both @xmath52 and @xmath62 are algebraically disconnected with one algebraic component @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , corresponding to each component @xmath72 of @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath73 is a knot , let @xmath74 be the peripheral subgroup of @xmath75 generated by the meridian @xmath76 and longitude @xmath77 of @xmath73 . in @xcite",
    ", joyce defines a quandle structure on the set of right cosets @xmath78 by declaring @xmath79 .",
    "he denotes this quandle as @xmath80 and then proves that it is isomorphic to @xmath81 .",
    "this is the key step in joyce s proof that the quandle is a complete knot invariant up to reverse mirror image .",
    "it also implies that the order of @xmath81 is the index of @xmath74 in @xmath22 and hence that @xmath81 is infinite when @xmath73 is nontrivial .",
    "the key result of this paper is the following theorem which extends joyce s result to the case of @xmath62 .",
    "[ key result ] if @xmath82 is a link in @xmath51 and @xmath83 is the subgroup of @xmath84 generated by the meridian @xmath85 and longitude @xmath86 of @xmath72 , then the quandle @xmath87 is isomorphic to the algebraic component @xmath71 of @xmath62 .",
    "section 2 is devoted to proving theorem  [ key result ] . in section 3",
    "we use this result , as well as a theorem of joyce , to prove the conjecture of przytycki stated in the abstract .",
    "theorem  [ key result ] implies that the todd - coxeter process for coset enumeration can be used to describe @xmath71 provided it is finite . in section  4",
    "we describe this in greater detail and give examples . in the last section , we enumerate all links that have finite @xmath0-quandles for some @xmath0 . in a separate set of papers",
    ", we plan to describe the @xmath0-quandles of these links , thereby providing a tabulation of all finite quandles that appear as the @xmath0-quandle of a link .",
    "the first of these papers is @xcite , where we describe the 2-quandle of every montesinos link of the form @xmath88 .",
    "the authors extend their thanks to daryl cooper and francis bonahon for their assistance with section  5 .",
    "the authors also thank the referee for helpful comments .",
    "to prove theorem  [ key result ] we make use of topological descriptions of both the fundamental quandle @xmath52 and the @xmath0-quandle @xmath62 .",
    "we begin by recalling fenn and rourke s formulation of @xmath52 given in @xcite and then extend it to @xmath62 .",
    "( their formulation is actually for the rack associated to a framed link . )",
    "let @xmath89 be the exterior of @xmath1 and choose a basepoint @xmath90 in @xmath91 .",
    "define @xmath92 to be the set of all homotopy classes of paths @xmath93\\to x$ ] such that @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , we require that any homotopy be through a sequence of paths each of which starts at @xmath90 and ends at @xmath96 .",

    "see figure  [ topological defn ] .",
    "note that the algebraic component @xmath108 corresponding to the @xmath109-th component @xmath72 of @xmath1 consists of those paths ending at @xmath110 .",
    "the equivalence of @xmath52 and @xmath92 is proven in @xcite .",
