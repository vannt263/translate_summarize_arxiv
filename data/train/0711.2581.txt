    "more than 30 extra - solar planets are now known to transit their parent stars , most of which were discovered through photometric monitoring .",
    "transit surveys which use a narrow - field and a large magnitude depth have had some success ; most notably that of the ogle transiting planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "surveys which utilise the `` wide and shallow '' technique of monitoring relatively bright field stars have achieved recent rapid success , including the discoveries of tres-3 @xcite , xo-2b @xcite , and several new hatnet planets ( @xcite for example ) .",
    "the transit technique has matured through overcoming serious obstacles which were impeding the data analysis , such as improved optimal photometric methods for wide - field detectors @xcite and reduction of correlated ( red ) noise @xcite .    the wide angle search for planets ( wasp ) project currently operates two superwasp instruments @xcite , one in the northern hemisphere on la palma ( superwasp - n ) and the other ( superwasp - s ) located at south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "the relatively large field - of - view ( fov ) of the superwasp design allows each instrument to monitor a substantial amount of the visible sky with relatively high time resolution .",
    "superwasp - n has been acquiring data since late-2003 , achieving photometric precision of 1% for stars brighter than @xmath1 .",
    "the process of extracting reliable transit signatures from the superwasp data involves a systematic approach of removing trends from the photometry , employing an efficient transit detection algorithm @xcite , and performing spectroscopic follow - up using both low - medium resolution and high resolution spectrographs to identify false - positives and confirm planetary candidates .",
    "this method has already been used successfully on superwasp data to detect the planets wasp-1b and wasp-2b @xcite . however",
    ", this process typically begins with millions of lightcurves from which many transit candidates are found and provides an extremely useful reference source for future surveys which monitor the same fields .",
    "for this reason , the transit candidates detected in several ra ranges have been published for the benefit of the transit survey community @xcite .",
    "we present the results of a photometric search for exoplanetary transits using data from superwasp - n , covering the fields in the range 06hr @xmath0 ra @xmath0 16hr .",
    "section 2 describes the 2003/2004 superwasp - n observing campaign , the predicted transit recovery rate , and the data reduction techniques .",
    "section 3 discusses the transit detection algorithm and the candidate selection criteria .",
    "the results of this search are presented in section 4 with discussion of the candidates which have been followed up and those which are considered high priority .",
    "section 5 discusses the results from the analysis and the number of final candidates in relation to the limitations of the survey for this particular ra range .",
    "the superwasp - n instrument is a robotic observatory designed to provide precision photometry for large areas of sky .",
    "first light was achieved in november 2003 and observations have continued until the present time .",
    "the instrument consists of a fork mount which is able to support up to eight lens / detector combinations simultaneously , described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "when the instrument is operating at full capacity , the sky coverage becomes substantial leading to a total fov of 482 square degrees . with a pixel scale of 13.7 arcsec per pixel . during the 2003/2004 ( hereafter referred to as 2004 ) observing season ,",
    "five out of the eight detectors were installed .",
    "even so , the data rate from those five cameras exceeded the electronic transfer capability of the ethernet connection on la palma at that time and so data was stored via a tape ( dlt ) autoloader then mailed to data reduction sites .",
    "the observing strategy during the 2004 observations was given careful consideration , mostly in an effort to reduce the false - alarm rate due to blended eclipsing binaries @xcite .",
    "this is a particularly important problem to solve for instruments such as superwasp whose wide fields can encompass a significant gradient in stellar densities and whose large pixel sizes greatly increase the chance of blending .",
    "the fields monitored were selected at 1 hour increments in ra and lying along @xmath2 .",
    "this avoided the galactic plane and hence over - crowding in the fields .",
    "in addition , the ecliptic was avoided to reduce sky contamination from the moon and other bright solar system objects .",
    "an exposure time of 30 seconds was used for maximum dynamic range and observations cycled between up to 8 fields .",
    "the slew - time of the mount ensured that an observing cadence @xmath3 minutes per field was achieved .",
    "the resulting dataset contains lightcurves for over 6.7 million stars in the magnitude range @xmath4 .",
    "these data were divided by ra range into six separate datasets which each contained @xmath5 million stars .",
    ".fields observed using superwasp - n during 2004 in the range 06hr @xmath0 ra @xmath0 16hr .",
    "the table shows the total number of stars monitored per field , as well as the number of extracted stars for transit hunting @xmath6 , the initial number of candidates identified by the detection algorithm @xmath7 , and the final number of candidates @xmath8 .

    "however , the periodogram reveals that there are significant peaks at longer periods , especially at 2.45 days .",
    "there is a relatively large amount of scatter in the lightcurve and the signal - to - noise of the ellipsoidal variation @xmath10 is barely inside the rejection cutoff .",
    "it should also be noted that there are two fainter objects within the 48aperture .",
    "even so , the lightcurve exhibits a flat - bottomed transit and flat out - of transit behaviour .",
    "the estimates of host spectral type and transit depth indicate a planet size of 1.55 @xmath11 .",
    "* 1swasp j130322.00 + 350525.4 : * this is the brightest of the final candidates although only 6 transits were observed during the 2004 campaign .",
    "the period of @xmath12 days is well matched with the 3.26 hour duration according to the value of @xmath13 .",
    "the low value of @xmath10 indicates that there is almost no ellipsoidal variation and is further strengthened by the lack of any faint companions within the aperture .",
    "the estimated size of the planet is 1.06 @xmath11 .",
    "the transit appears to be `` v - shaped '' however so there is still a strong chance of this transit candidate being a grazing eclipsing binary .",
    "also , the lack of transits cause the period determination to be relatively uncertain , as evidenced by the lack of a strongly unique fourier power in the periodogram .",
    "* 1swasp j152131.01 + 213521.3 : * this candidate is the faintest to meet all of the selection criteria .",
    "a total of 21 transits were observed however resulting in a very strong peak in the periodogram at a period of @xmath14 days .",
    "the ellipsoidal variation is very low , the signal to red noise ratio is very high , and the transit is flat - bottomed .",
    "the estimate of the planetary radius in this case is 1.62 @xmath11 , which is slightly above the radius cutoff described in section 3.3 but the other positive attributes of the candidate justified its inclusion in the final list .",
    "* 1swasp j160211.83 + 281010.4 : * this candidate is in fact the known transiting planet xo-1b , which was discovered by @xcite .",
    "it is encouraging that this planet was detected with a high degree of confidence ( high @xmath15 ) by the detection algorithm , for which 11 transits were observed .",
    "the vsi analysis detected no brighter or fainter companions within the aperture .",
    "the orbital period of 3.94 days and estimated radius of 1.21 @xmath11 are in good agreement with the values reported by @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the superwasp - n xo-1b data may be found in @xcite .",
    "* 1swasp j160242.43 + 290850.1 : * this relatively faint candidate has 23 observed transits with a best - fit period of @xmath16 days and a duration of 1.87 hours .",
    "based upon the spectral type of the host star , the estimated radius of the planet is 1.53 @xmath11 .",
    "however , there is a fainter object within the aperture and the transit is `` v - shaped '' which means that this is possibly due to a grazing eclipsing binary rather than a true planetary transit .",
    "additionally , there is a second dominant peak in the periodogram at @xmath17 days . folding the data on this longer period reveals two",
    "eclipses of slightly different depth .",
    "this further evidence indicates that this candidate is most likely not due to a planet .",
    "* 1swasp j161732.90 + 242119.0 : * there are 16 transits observed for this candidate with a period of @xmath18 days and a duration of 1.44 hours .",
    "the ellipsoidal variation is extremely low and there are no detected faint companions within the aperture .",
    "the large colour index of this star indicates a late - k spectral type which leads to a relatively small estimate for the planet radius of 0.76 @xmath11 .",
    "the promising nature of this candidate led to spectroscopic follow - up observations , described in section 4.3 .",
    "the major source of transit mimics amongst candidates are eclipsing binaries .",
    "these can be either grazing eclipsers of @xmath19 depth or blended eclipsers contributing @xmath19 of light @xcite .",
    "wide - field surveys such as superwasp and wasp0 generally suffer from heavily undersampled stellar profiles due to the large pixel sizes . in most cases ,",
    "eclipsing binaries can be excluded through photometric analysis , the catalogue queries provided by vsi , or straightforward multi - colour observations using a higher angular resolution telescope to resolve blended objects .",
    "the techniques described in section 3 were used on all the superwasp - n 2004 fields to construct a list of high priority candidates .",
    "further study of these candidates required precision radial velocity measurements to test the planet hypothesis of the observed transit events . a sample of the high priority candidates were subsequently observed using the sophie cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph on the 1.93 m telescope at the observatoire de haute - provence @xcite .",
    "sophie achieved first light on 31st july , 2006 and so the follow - up campaign undertaken by the superwasp consortium was amongst the first science applications of the instrument .    amongst these candidates observed during these runs was the last of the candidates shown in table 4 : 1swasp j161732.90 + 242119.0 . a single narrow - lined cross - correlation function ( ccf )",
    "was observed for each of the spectra obtained .",
    "evidence of pressure broadening was seen in the nai@xmath20 and mgi@xmath20 lines with slight asymmetry and red - shifted emission in the h@xmath21 line .",
    "a radial velocity variation of only a few m / s determined from three spectra were used to conlude that there is no significant evidence of radial velocity induced behaviour due to the presence of a planet .",
    "hence , this candidate has been ruled out as a transiting planet from the sophie observations .",
    "the remainder of the candidates have been assigned priorities and await further observations .",
    "presented here is a brief discussion for a subset of the rejected candidates shown in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "the purpose of this discussion is to highlight the quality of these candidates and hence the potential for false - alarms being needlessly observed with spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "the lightcurves and bls periodigrams for these six examples are shown in figures 5 and 6 . these exhibit strong transit - like signatures but the information available for the majority of the rejected candidates from stages two and three of the sifting process indicated that the size of the secondary is too large to be a planetary companion .",

    "a total of 13 transits were observed and folding the data on the strongest periodogram peak @xmath22 days yields a flat - bottomed transit lightcurve , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "however , binning the data reveals the out - of - eclipse variation which is further supported by the high value of @xmath10 , although the value of @xmath23 is very high due to the depth of the eclipse .",
    "this candidate was rejected on the basis of its high ellipsoidal variation .    *",
    "1swasp j152645.62 + 310204.3 : * a total of 16 transits observed with a well - constrained period of @xmath24 days favoured this candidate . a relatively high ellipsoidal variation , however , excluded this candidate from passing through the second stage of selection criteria",
    "indeed , the out - of - eclipse variation becomes especially apparent when the data is binned .",
    "* 1swasp j153135.51 + 305957.1 : * this appears to be a promising candidate with a strong signal to red noise ratio and 10 transits observed .",
    "the flat - bottomed transits in the lightcurve folded on a period of @xmath25 days appear to be very convincing and the candidate passed through to the third stage of candidate sifting .",
    "even though the exoplanetary disgnostic @xmath13 is unity for this candidate , the estimated size of the planet based upon the spectral type is 2.03 @xmath11 and so was excluded from appearing in the final list .",
    "a brown dwarf companion , though possible , is only likely for relatively young ages where ongoing contraction allows for a large radius @xcite .",
    "detection of low - mass stellar companions such as ogle - tr-122b @xcite and hat - tr-205 - 103 @xcite have shown that even low mass stars can have radii comparable to or even less than giant planets .",
    "this target will be the subject of further observations in a low - mass eclipsing binary study .",
    "* 1swasp j160944.95 + 202609.7 : * a large transit depth , or which 16 were observed , contributed to this star having a very high @xmath15 and @xmath26 .",
    "additionally , the period of @xmath27 days is well determined by the strong peak in the periodogram .",
    "however , the transits are distinctly `` v - shaped '' in appearance and the ellipsoidal variation is slightly too large to prevent exclusion from the list of candidates .    *",
    "1swasp j163245.61 + 321754.9 : * this candidate was one of the strongest candidates selected by the detection algorithm and the subsequent visual inspection .",
    "the @xmath15 , @xmath26 , and signal to red noise ratio are all exceptionally high",
    ". indeed , the relative strength of the primary peak in the periodogram at a period of @xmath28 days is striking .",
    "the transits are flat - bottomed and there is little evidence of out - of - eclipse variation for the 10 eclipses observed , although there is slight evidence for a secondary eclipse in the binned lightcurve . the measured ellipsoidal variation for this star is more than enough for it to be excluded from the candidate list , strengthening the case of this candidate being an eclipsing binary star .",
    "* 1swasp j165949.13 + 265346.1 : * this lightcurve is a good example of a transit mimic in that it is a subtle dip in the lightcurve with a small depth , which is generally the signature one would expect from a transiting planet .",
    "the 11 observed transits folded on the period of @xmath29 days look convincing even when binned .",
    "however , once again the ellipsoidal variation reveals that this star is also likely to be either a blend of an eclipsing binary or a grazing eclipsing binary system .",
    "the preceding sections have described how 130,566 stars were extracted from 729,335 for transit searching ; and how the yield of 5,445 candidates was reduced to a list of 6 candidates through the stringent selection criteria .",
    "the criteria were largely designed to aggressively remove the primary source of false - alarms , eclipsing binary stars , from the candidate list . in this sense , the criteria proved to be very successful since , for example , the ellipsoidal variation criteria dealt a devastating blow against the kinds of false - alarms during the second stage and was the major cause for elimination .",
    "though this removed some very promising looking candidates from the list , the evidence presented by closer examination of a subset of the rejected candidates shows that there is indeed clear eclipsing binary behaviour in the binned lightcurves , if not in the unbinned data .",
    "the major source of elimination during the third stage of candidate sifting was an excessive estimate of the planet size , also generally due to an eclipsing binary star .",
    "some flexibility was allowed in the size criteria , particularly in view of the recent detection of the large exoplanet tres-4 @xcite .",
    "the detection of xo-1b by the transit detection algorithm and the subsequent passing of all the selection criteria is an important test for the transit sifting process .",
    "however , the recent discovery of hat - p-3b @xcite was cause for concern since it was observed in one of the 13h fields and has the identifier 1swasp j134422.58 + 480143.2 .",
    "the period of @xmath30 days is within the parameter space which was searched by the detection algorithm . based upon the ephemeris information provided by @xcite ,",
    "the star was observed numerous times by superwasp - n during at least 5 predicted transits during the 2004 observing season . however ,",
    "examination of the data show that the s /",
    "n for this star is exceptionally low which resulted in a correspondingly low @xmath15 during the fitting process .",
    "combining the data with that from the 2006/2007 seasons will undoubtedly yield a better result for this star .    considering the large amount of sky surveyed in the ra range presented in this paper ,",
    "it is worth investigating the number of extra - solar planet candidates one should expect and the practical limitations on achieving this number .",
    "analysis of radial velocity surveys such as @xcite and @xcite has shown that planet host - stars are preferentially higher in metallicity .",
    "the field stars surveyed in these fields are predominantly f  g  k dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood and so solar metallicity is a reasonable approximation . based upon the besanon model @xcite constructed by @xcite , @xmath31% of the stars in typical superwasp fields",
    "k type and are therefore of small enough size to produce detectable transit dips . of the 130,566 stars in the 06h16h fields searched for transits , around 60,000 stars will meet this criteria .",
    "it has been noted before by such papers as @xcite that the frequency of hot jupiters and the geometric consideration of randomly oriented orbits will result in @xmath32% of stars having an observable transiting planet in a @xmath33 day orbit .",
    "this produces an estimate of 60 transit candidates for the fields considered in this paper .",
    "however , despite the large amount of sky coverage in the 06h16h ra range and the correspondingly large amount of stars monitored , the largest constraint on these data is the lack of baseline coverage which severely impedes the ability to detect multiple transits .",
    "the probability plots shown in figure 1 demonstrate this clearly with even the 14h fields only having a 20% chance of observing 4 transits of a 5 day period planet .",
    "given this limitation for transit hunting in this dataset , the final number of 6 transit candidates is not an unreasonable detection rate . the eventual combination of several years of superwasp data will greatly help to alleviate this deficiency for this particular ra range .",
    "though the criteria used to remove eclipsing binary stars was generally very successful , the problem of blended eclipsing binaries ( as discussed by @xcite ) is more difficult to solve .",
    "@xcite gives a particularly tricky example in which the light from a k dwarf binary system was blended with the light from a late f dwarf star .",
    "avoiding confusion with these kinds of systems requires the use of careful spectroscopic follow - up to identify blended light . the strategy adopted for superwasp targets was to obtain high - resolution spectroscopic snapshots of high priority candidates for fast and efficient elimination of blends ( described in detail by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the follow - up campaign during 2006/2007 is continued photometric monitoring , medium - resolution spectra for blend elimination , two - colour precision photometry at the predicted times of transit , and finally precision radial velocity monitoring using such instruments as sophie .",
    "this paper has described the acquisition , analysis , and results from the transit - hunting superwasp - n 2004 observing campaign covering a right ascension range of 06hr @xmath0 ra @xmath0 16hr .",
    "even though 56 fields were monitored during this campaign , the lack of baseline coverage resulted in the rejection of 23 fields from which 130,566 stars were extracted to be searched for transit signatures .",
    "the selection criteria which were applied to the resulting candidates proved to be exceptionally powerful at removing eclipsing binaries from the candidate list due to the ellipsoidal variations and the estimated planet size based upon the transit depth . amongst the final candidates",
    "is the known transiting planet xo-1b which further demonstrates the strength of the transit sifting process .    from the final list of 6 transit candidates ,",
    "the photometry alone indicates that 1swasp j160242.43 + 290850.1 is in fact likely to be the signature of a eclipsing binary rather than a planet .",
    "furthermore , follow - up spectroscopy of 1swasp j161732.90 + 242119.0 shows that there is no significant radial velocity variation , resulting in its rejection as a planet candidate .",
    "further follow - up observations , both photometric and spectroscopic , are being undertaken for these and other fields from the 2004 superwasp observing campaign .",
    "however , the real strength of the 0616h range will be realised when the 2004 data is combined with that of subsequent years to create an exceptional baseline for transit hunting .",
    "the wasp consortium consists of representatives from the queen s university belfast , university of cambridge ( wide field astronomy unit ) , instituto de astrofisica de canarias , isaac newton group of telescopes ( la palma ) , university of keele , university of leicester , open university , and the university of st andrews .",
    "the superwasp - n instrument was constructed and operated with funds made available from the consortium universities and the particle physics and astronomy research council .",
    "superwasp - n is located in the spanish roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma , canary islands which is operated by the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( iac ) .",
    "the data reduction and analysis described in this made extensive use of the starlink software collection , without which this project would not have been possible .",
    "this research also made use of the simbad database and vizier catalogue service , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "in addition we made use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",

    "<S> these installations are designed to provide high time - resolution photometry for the purpose of detecting transiting extra - solar planets , asteroids , and transient events . here </S>",
    "<S> we present results from a transit - hunting observing campaign using superwasp - n covering a right ascension range of 06hr @xmath0 ra @xmath0 16hr . </S>",
    "<S> this paper represents the fifth and final in the series of transit candidates released from the 2004 observing season . in total , </S>",
    "<S> 729,335 stars from 33 fields were monitored with 130,566 having sufficient precision to be scanned for transit signatures . </S>",
    "<S> using a robust transit detection algorithm and selection criteria , 6 stars were found to have events consistent with the signature of a transiting extra - solar planet based upon the photometry , including the known transiting planet xo-1b . </S>",
    "<S> these transit candidates are presented here along with discussion of follow - up observations and the expected number of candidates in relation to the overall observing strategy .    </S>",
    "<S> methods : data analysis  planetary systems  stars : variables : other </S>"
