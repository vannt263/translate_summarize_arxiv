    "the recent surge of interest in wave maps ( known in the physics literature as @xmath9-models ) stems from the fact that they provide an attractive toy - model for more complicated relativistic field equations .",
    "in particular they share some features with the einstein equations so understanding the problems of global existence and formation of singularities for wave maps may shed some light on the analogous , but much more difficult , problems in general relativity . having this analogy in mind",
    "we have studied the cauchy problem for eq.(2 ) in the case where the domain space is @xmath0 minkowski spacetime , @xmath10 , and the target space is the 3-sphere , @xmath11 . although our primary motivation was an attempt to get insight into some aspects of critical behavior in gravitational collapse , we think that our results are interesting in their own right . in this paper",

    "equivariant maps have the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a homogeneous harmonic polynomial of degree @xmath20 .",
    "in what follows we consider the case @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ( such maps are called corotational ) . for a corotational map the cauchy problem for eq.([wmap ] ) reduces to the semilinear wave equation @xmath23 with initial data @xmath24 the conserved energy associated with solutions of this equation @xmath25=\\frac{1}{2 } \\int_0^{\\infty } ( r^2 u_t^2 + r^2 u_r^2 +    2\\sin^2\\!{u})\\ : dr\\ ] ] is manifestly nonnegative and scales as @xmath26=\\lambda e[u(x)]$ ] which means that eq.([eq ] ) is supercritical ( like einstein s equations ) .",
    "it is widely believed that for supercritical equations the solutions with sufficiently small initial data exist for all times while large data solutions develop singularities in finite time  @xcite . in the case of ( [ eq ] ) the global existence for small ( in the sobolev space @xmath27 with sufficiently large @xmath28 )",
    "data was proved by kovalyov  @xcite and sideris  @xcite . for large data",
    "there are no rigorous results , however it is known that there exist smooth data which lead to blowup in finite time .",
    "an example of such data is due to shatah who showed that ( [ eq ] ) admits a self - similar solution @xmath29 which is perfectly smooth for @xmath30 but breaks down at @xmath31 .",
    "turok and spergel  @xcite found this solution in closed form @xmath32 so in the following we will refer to @xmath33 as the ts solution .",
    "on the basis of our numerical simulations we conjecture that the example of blowup given by shatah is generic . by this",
    "we mean that there is a large open set of initial data which blow up in a finite time @xmath34 and the asymptotic shape of solutions near the blowup point ( @xmath35 ) approaches @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "in this sense the blowup can be considered as local convergence to the ts solution @xmath33 . actually , our failed efforts to produce a non - self - similar singularity lead us to suspect that the blowup is universally self - similar .",
    "note that the self - similarity of blowup excludes a concentration of energy at the singularity and suggests that the solutions can be continued beyond the blowup time in an almost continuous fashion .",
    "we must admit that this aspect of singularity formation for wave maps is somewhat disappointing from the standpoint of modeling the formation of energy trapping singularities ( like black holes ) .",
    "whenever the singularities develop from some but not all data , there arises a natural question of determining the threshold of singularity formation .",
    "we investigated this issue using a basic technique of evolving various one - parameter families of initial data which interpolate between global existence ( dispersion ) and blowup .",
    "along each such family there exists a point ( critical initial data ) which separates the two regimes .",
    "we show that the critical initial data blow up in a finite time @xmath34 and the asymptotic shape of solutions near the blowup point ( @xmath35 ) approaches @xmath38 , a self - similar solution with one unstable mode .",
    "the marginally critical data approach @xmath39 for intermediate times but eventually the unstable mode becomes dominant and ejects the solutions towards dispersion or stable blowup ( that is , @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus , we conjecture that the codimension - one stable manifold of the solution @xmath39 plays the role of the threshold of singularity formation for a large set of initial data .",
    "the threshold behavior in our model is similar to the type ii critical behavior in gravitational collapse ( see  @xcite for the recent review ) where self - similar solutions of einstein s equations ( continuous or discrete , depending on a model ) sit at the threshold of formation of a black hole .",
    "there are also many parallels between our results and the work of brenner et al  @xcite on the chemotaxis equation .",
    "all that suggests that self - similar behavior at the threshold of singularity formation is a common feature for evolutionary partial differential equation .",

    "this potential has infinitely many bound states as can be shown by the following standard argument .",
    "consider the perturbation induced by the scaling transformation @xmath127 this is an eigenfunction to zero eigenvalue ( so called zero mode ) .",

    "can such a beast play any role in dynamical evolution ?",
    "the answer is not clear to us .",
    "the point is that both the infinite energy and infinite instability of @xmath117 have an origin in the far - field behavior so it does not seem impossible that solutions @xmath129 truncated at some radius appear as local attractors at the threshold for singularity formation in the evolution of very special initial data of noncompact support .",
    "we have serious misgivings about this result , in particular we do not understand the discussion of `` critical '' solutions which are not intermediate attractors . ] .",
    "an alternative way of looking at this issue is to consider solutions of ( [ static ] ) in a finite region @xmath132 , that is harmonic maps from a ball @xmath133 into @xmath13 . in the dirichlet case ,",

    "in this section we describe the results of our numerical simulations of the cauchy problem ( [ eq])-([data ] ) .",
    "the main goal of these simulations was to identify the generic final states of evolution ( stable attractors ) and determine the boundaries between their basins of attraction .",
    "we emphasize that the convergence to attractors ( which is due to radiation of energy to infinity ) is always meant in a local sense . before going into details , we would like to say a few words about the numerical techniques we employed .",
    "the simulations were performed by two different finite difference methods .",
    "the first method was based on an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm .",
    "this code allowed us to probe the structure of solutions near the singularity with good resolution .",
    "the second method , designed specially to study the convergence to self - similar solutions , solved the cauchy problem for eq.([rho - tau ] ) on a fixed grid . in this case",
    "there was no need of mesh refinement because the convergence to self - similar profiles is a smooth process in similarity variables .",
    "the main difficulty of using similarity variables is that we do not know the blowup time @xmath34 in advance , which means that we have to deal with the gauge mode instability . to suppress this instability ( that is , to guess a blowup time @xmath34 ) we fine - tuned an extra parameter in the initial data",
    "the fact that the two independent numerical techniques generated basically the same outputs makes us feel confident about our results .",
    "we remind that initial data of finite energy can be classified according to the topological degree of the wave map at a fixed time ( which is a map from topological @xmath13 into @xmath13 ) .",
    "since the degree is preserved by evolution , the cauchy problem breaks into infinitely many topological sectors .",
    "the nonzero degree data are not small by definition , and we conjecture that they always develop singularities .",
    "thus , from the point of view of studying the threshold for singularity formation , only degree",
    "zero data are interesting so most of our discussion is focused to such data .",
    "a typical example is an ingoing `` gaussian '' @xmath146,\\quad    u_t(r,0)=\\psi(r)=\\phi'(r).\\ ] ] in agreement with rigorous results of @xcite we found that if the initial data are sufficiently small then the solution disperses , that is it converges uniformly on any compact interval to the `` vacuum '' solution @xmath113 .",
    "in contrast , large initial data develop singularities in finite time  this manifests itself in an unbounded growth of the gradient of solution at @xmath35 .",
    "the precise character of blowup will be described below .      in order to determine the boundary between two generic asymptotic states of evolution , dispersion and collapse , we considered the evolution of various interpolating one - parameter families of initial data @xmath147 , that is such families that the corresponding solutions exist globally if the parameter @xmath148 is small and blow up if the parameter @xmath148 is large . along each interpolating family there must exist a critical parameter value @xmath149 which separates these two regimes .",
    "given two values @xmath150 and @xmath151 , it is straightforward ( in principle ) to find @xmath149 by bisection . repeating this for many different interpolating families of initial data one obtains a set of critical data which by construction belongs to the threshold . in order to figure out the structure of the threshold one needs to determine the flow of critical data .",
    "the precisely critical data can not be prepared numerically but in practice it is sufficient to follow the evolution of marginally critical data .",
    "we found that the flow of such data has a transient phase when it seems to approach the self - similar solution @xmath152 for some @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "this behavior is universal in the sense that it is independent of the family of initial data ; only the parameter @xmath34 depends on the data .",
    "this kind of behavior can be naturally explained as follows .",
    "as we showed above , the self - similar solution @xmath39 has exactly one unstable mode ( apart from the gauge mode )  in other words the stable manifold of this solution , @xmath153 , has codimension one and therefore generic one parameter families of initial data do intersect it .",
    "the points of intersection correspond to critical initial data that converge asymptotically to @xmath39 .",
    "the marginally critical data , by continuity , initially remain close to @xmath153 and approach @xmath39 for intermediate times but eventually are repelled from its vicinity along the one - dimensional unstable manifold ( see fig .  5 ) . within this picture",
    "the universality of marginally critical dynamics in the intermediate asymptotics follows immediately from the fact that the same unstable mode dominates the evolution of all solutions .",
    "more precisely , the evolution of marginally critical solutions in the intermediate asymptotics can be approximated as @xmath154 where @xmath44 , @xmath70 , and @xmath155 .",
    "the small constant @xmath156 , which is the only vestige of the initial data , quantifies an admixture of the unstable mode  for precisely critical data @xmath157 .",
    "the `` lifetime '' @xmath158 of the transient phase during which the linear approximation ( [ inter ] ) is valid is determined by the time in which the unstable mode grows to a finite size , that is @xmath159 .",
    "using @xmath160 , this gives @xmath161 .    [ !",

    "these data are identical , except for the amplitudes which differ by @xmath162 , so the solutions practically coincide until the last frame .",
    "the influence of the gauge mode instability is minimized by fine - tuning the width of the gaussian . the convergence to the self - similar profile @xmath163 ( dotted line ) is clearly seen . in the last frame",

    "we consider first the kink - type initial data of degree one , for example @xmath164 .",

    "more precisely , for such solutions there exists a time @xmath34 such that @xmath175 inside the past light cone of the point @xmath47 .",
    "note that in the case of self - similar blowup the energy does not concentrate at the singularity ; in fact the energy inside the past light cone of the point @xmath47 decreases linearly with @xmath176 .",
    "this suggests that the solutions can be continued beyond the blowup time .",
    "indeed , in figs .  8 and 9",
    "we show solutions just after the blowup . at @xmath35 the solution @xmath177 jumps from @xmath172 to @xmath173 as @xmath174 crosses @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath113 and @xmath178 correspond geometricaly to the same point , namely the north pole of @xmath13 , the solution passing through the singularity remains smooth everywhere , except at one point @xmath179 .",
    "moreover , the solution retains the self - similar profile at least for some time after the blowup .",
    "we have studied the cauchy problem for corotational wave maps from @xmath0 minkowski spacetime into the 3-sphere .",
    "we found that self - similar solutions play a special role in the dynamical evolution .",
    "the stable self - similar solution ( turok - spergel solution ) determines the asymptotic profile of solutions that blow up in finite time . the self - similar solution with one instability plays the role of a critical solution , that is , its stable manifold separates solutions that blow up from solutions that disperse . of course , it is impossible to explore numerically the whole phase space , so the complete picture of singularity formation and critical behavior might be richer than the one sketched here .",
    "in particular our analysis leaves open the question about the role of a family of static solutions .",
    "although we have not systematically investigated the nontrivial topological sectors of the model , we anticipate a rich phenomenology of singularity formation for solutions with high degree ; for example we have observed such solutions evolving ( in a weak sense ) through a sequence of blowup times @xmath180 .    in our opinion",
    "the most interesting open question is : why the large data solutions become self - similar near the singularity ?",
    "we think that this problem should be approached in similarity variables in which the problem of blowup translates into a question of asymptotic behavior as @xmath181 .",
    "note that the evolution equation expressed in similarity variables ( [ rho - tau ] ) resembles the wave equation with damping .",
    "it is thus natural to seek a lyapunov functional , that is a functional that decreases in time on solutions . if such a functional exists then its minima are the candidates for generic asymptotic states of evolution , while its saddle points are the candidates for positive codimension attractors .",
    "now , the self - similar solutions @xmath61 restricted to the interval @xmath182 $ ] are the critical points of the functional @xmath183 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_0 ^ 1 \\left(\\rho^2 u_{\\rho}^2 - \\frac{2 \\cos^2(u)}{1-\\rho^2 } \\right ) d\\rho.\\ ] ] although we were unable to show that this is a lyapunov functional for eq.([rho - tau ] ) , we believe that the mechanism suggested here is responsible for asymptotic self - similarity of blowup .",
