    "i will start recalling the case for searches and studies of lepton flavor violation and also the interest of analysing it within ( the simplest ) little higgs models .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations evidences their non - vanishing mass and makes the charged lepton sector the only fermion subarea where flavor violation has not been unveiled yet .",
    "moreover , the minimal extension of the sm with @xmath5 massive neutrinos predicts non - zero ( although undetectable ) branching ratios for charged lfv processes , i. e. @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the discovery of charged lfv would correspond , necessarily , to the effect of new dynamics .",
    "for this reason there is an extensive hunt for new physics in searches for lfv muon , tau , higgs , @xmath7 decays and @xmath1 conversion in nuclei ; on which we had several experimental talks at this workshop @xcite ( see also the corresponding sections of @xcite ) . without dwelling in more detail into these ,",
    "let us just highlight the impressive upper limit recently achieved by meg @xmath8 @xcite , which is a stringent constraint on new physics models . in parallel to this exhaustive experimental activity",
    "there is not a corresponding effort on the theory side ( but for the easiest @xmath9 decays ) and limited activity on the semileptonic lfv tau decays has been carried on @xcite .",
    "lfv is not intrinsically related to any of the known problems of the standard model ( sm ) : dark matter , baryon asymmetry of the universe , dark energy , ( little ) hierarchy problem , flavor problem , etc .",
    "however , it will be hopefully linked to any / some of them , so that its eventual measurement will shed light on any of these issues , helping to find the next standard theory .",
    "little higgs models arise as an elegant solution to the ( little ) hierarchy problem on the higgs mass : since the higgs boson couples proportionally to others particles masses , its mass would get huge quantum loop corrections in the presence of generic heavy new physics . therefore , @xmath10 gev would need to result from an extreme fine - tuning among the diverse corrections . a theoretically beautiful solution to this problem",
    "is provided by supersymmetry , but the absence of susy particles at a tev questions that nature chose this way .",
    "another classical solution to the problem comes from the analog with qcd .",
    "technicolor and its different evolutions again face naturalness problems when confronted to the lack of their imprints on lhc data . still , the idea of composite higgs models @xcite can be the starting point to formulate a theory in which the higgs boson is naturally light that accords with all present observations .",
    "scalar boson masses are not protected by any symmetry , however the pion is so light because it is the pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breakdown .",
    "the idea of lh models is to justify the small higgs mass similarly , as a consequence of the breaking of a global symmetry .",
    "these models assume a scale of compositeness @xmath11 ( above which the new global symmetry is also displayed ) , which is much smaller than the electroweak vev ( @xmath12 tev ) and the structure of the model is arranged so that the higgs mass is radiatively generated .",
    "there are new little particles with masses of @xmath13 and the uv completion of the model is expected at some tens of tevs , where the theory would become strongly coupled ( @xmath14 tev ) .",
    "thus we can expand perturbatively our amplitudes in @xmath15 and keep only the leading term .    among the lh models there are product group @xmath16^n)$ ] and simple group models ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "since the former need and ad - hoc symmetry ( t - parity ) to solve the hierarchy problem , we will take the simplest of the latter ( @xmath18 ) for our study of lfv tau @xcite and higgs decays @xcite that we present in sects .",
    "[ lfvtau ] and [ lfvhiggs ] preceded by a short account on the slh model next ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the symmetry structure of the slh model @xcite is given by @xmath19_1\\otimes \\left[su(3)\\otimes u(1)\\right]_2 $ ] , where only the diagonal group is gauged .",
    "there are two different symmetry breakdowns ( requiring two complex scalar fields , triplets under @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) : on the one hand the gauged diagonal subgroup is broken down to the sm electroweak gauge group , yielding 5 goldstone bosons which give mass to the additional little gauge bosons ( among these only @xmath22 and @xmath23 play a rle in our study ) . on the other hand , the global symmetry is broken similarly , with associated goldstone bosons including the higgs degrees of freedom .    every fermion family contains a left - handed triplet ( adding to the sm doublets one little particle ) and corresponding singlets .",
    "heavy neutrinos , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are fundamental to our study , since they drive the lfv through their couplings .",
    "though the quark sector is not unambiguously defined , we will follow the anomaly - free embedding for the new quarks . under reasonable assumptions ,",
    "only the first generation little quark , @xmath26 , matters to our discussion @xcite .",
    "we presented our results for @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ; @xmath29 is short for pseudoscalar meson and @xmath30 for vector resonance ) in ref .",
    "@xcite  . ] .",
    "there we decided to include the effect of only two heavy neutrinos in our analysis .",
    "this corresponds to the case where there is a gim - like mechanism acting in the mixing matrix among charged leptons and heavy neutrinos which effectively decouples @xmath31 . in this scenario , also",
    "the contributions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 cancel each other partially ( according to the similarity of their masses ) . here , instead , we will consider the most general scenario where no particular pattern of this mixing matrix is assumed . generally , this will increase our predicted lfv observables .",
    "the one - loop diagrams contributing to these decays can be seen in figures [ figgamma ] , [ figz ] and [ figbox ] ( with the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and box - mediated contributions , respectively ) . we have computed them in the unitary gauge , where only physical particles appear . as a result ,",
    "the cancellation of divergences becomes subtle , and the sum of the divergences of the penguin - like diagrams is cancelled by that of the box contributions .",
    "parity forbids @xmath36-mediated contributions to the processes with one pseudoscalar meson .",
    "however , since these and the box - mediated contributions turn out to be of similar magnitude and @xmath23 contributions are negligible in all cases . ] @xmath37 decays are predicted at a comparable rate to the @xmath38 processes . along our computation we have kept the leading term in the expansion parameter @xmath15 and set @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 to zero . also sets the largest scale of external momenta , which are then negligible in the evaluation of the loop integrals . ]     penguin - like diagrams for @xmath42 in the slh model . ]     penguin - like diagrams for @xmath43 in the slh model . ]     box diagrams for @xmath44 in the slh model .",
    "the internal quark states are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . ]    as a result of the embedding of the sm group into the slh group , the only couplings entering the amplitudes are the sm @xmath48 and @xmath49 couplings . in addition , the expressions depend on the ratios @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 appears in the change between the flavor and mass bases for the ( light and heavy ) neutrinos and turns out to be an important parameter allowing to set the bound @xmath53 tev @xcite ( in the two - heavy neutrino scenario ) studying @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the slh model  .",
    "the remaining expressions contain quark bilinear currents which still need to be hadronized to make contact with the experimental searches .",
    "this is done in an essentially model - independent way , writing those fermion bilinears in terms of the qcd quark currents and proceeding to their hadronization guided by chiral symmetry @xcite , axiomatic field theory properties implemented naturally through dispersion relations @xcite and the qcd asymptotics @xcite , benefitting as well from the precise data at our disposal on two - meson factors . for the these , we use the expressions given in refs .",

    "the @xmath30 cases can be obtained by considering the dominant @xmath57 channel with the di - meson system around the mass and width of the vector resonance ( @xmath58 for the @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the @xmath61 ) . ]    for our phenomenological analysis within the slh model , we have varied randomly the model parameters in the ranges @xmath62 tev @xmath63 tev , @xmath64tan@xmath65 , keeping its product below @xmath66 tev . in the mixing matrix between charged leptons and heavy",
    "neutrinos we have neglected cp violation but kept it general otherwise .",
    "we have allowed for a factor of up to ten in the ratio between successive heavy neutrino masses and verified that all lfv low - energy constraints were satisfied before admitting a point in the model s parameter space .",
    "this restriction is needed , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figtaumu ] .",
    "@xmath67 vs. @xmath68 in the slh model .",
    "the solid lines signal the upper limit at 90@xmath69 c. l. for each mode . ]    within the slh model , the correlation between the most restricting low - energy process and the most abundant one- and two - meson lfv tau decays and @xmath70 are extremely correlated , as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "this is a result of the hadronization process , as the @xmath58 channel is driven by the @xmath36-exchange , while the one - pion mode is saturated by the box contribution . ]",
    "is plotted in figures [ fig2a ] and [ fig2b ] , respectively . in both figures",
    "the x - axis is cut at the 90@xmath69 c.l .",
    "upper limit for @xmath71 . the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] indicates the corresponding upper limit for @xmath72 .",
    "a similar line is not shown on figure [ fig2b ] because if the other low - energy restrictions on lfv processes are fulfilled , @xmath73 is at least four orders of magnitude below its corresponding upper bound .",
    "thus , in the slh model , the only semileptonic lfv tau decays that can compete with @xmath56 , @xmath54 and @xmath74 as golden channels for the detection of lfv are @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( which is only a factor @xmath77 smaller than the @xmath58 mode ) .",
    "three - dimensional plots that allow to represent the simultaneous dependence of the branching ratios on two model parameters can be found in my talk s file @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not yield any new information ( provided the gim - like suppression is understood ) with respect to the most conventional 2-d plots .",
    "then , the dependence of the results on the model parameters is basically the one found for the case with only two effective heavy neutrinos in the 2-d plots of ref .",
    "@xcite : results depend quite mildly on @xmath11 , tan@xmath78 , max@xmath79 ( sin@xmath80 for the gim - like scenario ) and the heavy neutrino spectroscopy .",
    "as expected , brs : + - decrease with f according to the dependence of the amplitude on @xmath81 , + - are almost constant for tan@xmath82 , while they exhibit a marked narrow dip around tan@xmath83 , where the br is reduced by an order of magnitude .",

    "+ - vary smoothly with the neutrino masses hierarchy . in the gim - like case , the suppression of the brs gets stronger for @xmath86 .     correlation between @xmath67 and @xmath87 in the slh model . ]",
    "correlation between @xmath67 and @xmath70 in the slh model . ]",
    "it has not been necessary to update our analyses of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the model parameters follows the patters explained in sect .  [ lfvtau ] .",
    "as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fighiggs ] , even in the case with three active heavy neutrinos ( where the considered lfv higgs decays brs are four orders of magnitude larger than in the gim - like scenario @xcite ) the slh predicts unmeasurable brs at lhc , provided the low - energy constraints on lfv processes are satisfied .",
    "similar small brs for these decays have been found recently within lh models @xcite  .",
