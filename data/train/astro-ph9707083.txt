    "the r  cra association , at a distance of about 130  pc ( marraco & rydgren 1981 ) , is one of the nearest star - forming associations to the sun .",
    "the association is projected against a prominent dark cloud 18@xmath0 below the galactic plane ( see figure  1 of knacke _",
    "et al_.  1973 ) .",
    "the total mass of the cloud is estimated to be between 3000 and 10,000  m@xmath1 ( dame _ et al_.  1987 ; loren 1979 ) .",
    "et al_.  ( 1994 ) comment that the morphology of the cloud bears a resemblance to the @xmath2  oph cloud . however , the number of known and suspected members of the stellar association is only 10% of that known or suspected in @xmath2  oph .",
    "knacke _ et al_.  ( 1973 ) discovered a group of 11 young stars near r  cra .",
    "members of the association include the intermediate - mass stars r , t , and ty  cra and the classical t tauri stars s , vv , and dg  cra .",
    "nine of the 11 stars had near - ir continuum excesses .",
    "et al_.  also identified 10 h@xmath3-emitting stars spread over the region , at projected distances up to a half degree from the dark cloud .",
    "glass & penston ( 1975 ) undertook near - ir photometry of 44 stars in this region , and noted that the only stars with near - ir continuum excesses were the known variable stars .",
    "they failed to detect near - ir excesses for 3 of the h@xmath3-emitting stars identified by knacke _",
    "et al_.  , and commented that h@xmath3 emission and 2@xmath4 m excesses do not necessarily correlate .",
    "marraco & rydgren ( 1981 ) reexamined the association .",
    "they found h@xmath3 emission in only 4 of the 10 knacke _",
    "et al_.  sources , but discovered another 6 h@xmath3-emitting objects . wilking _",
    "et al_.  ( 1992 ) surveyed this region using the iras data , finding 16 iras sources associated with young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "they identified 24 ysos from their near- and far - ir spectral energy distributions . wilking _",
    "et al_.  ( 1994 ) presented results of near - ir imaging of the cloud core , and concluded that there are approximately 30 members of this association .",
    "knacke _ et al_.  ( 1973 ) estimated an association age of less than 10@xmath5  years ( 1  myr ) , assuming that the late - b stars of the association have just arrived on the main - sequence . wilking _",
    "et al_.  ( 1992 ) estimate an age of between 1.5  myr ( the contraction age of the zero - age main sequence b8 star ty  cra ) and 6  myr ( the contraction time for the pre - main sequence a5 star r  cra ) .",
    "while infrared observations can be useful in identifying low - mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars , experience over the past decade has shown that the population sampled in the infrared is not necessarily representative of the true population of young associations .",
    "x - ray imaging observations ( e.g. , feigelson & kriss 1981 ; montmerle _ et al_.  1983 ; feigelson _ et al_.  1993 ; mundt _ et al_.  1983 ; strom & strom 1994 ; walter _ et al_.  1988 , 1994 ) of young associations reveal a population of x - ray - luminous young stars which generally lack infrared continuum excesses .",
    "walter ( 1986 ) found 3 x - ray - luminous pms stars near the cra cloud .",
    "here we report on the complete einstein observatory imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) observations of the cra dark cloud .",
    "in addition to the 3 sources previously identified , there are another 8 x - ray sources . in this paper",
    "we discuss the identifications of these x - ray sources .",
    "the x - ray data consist of the two overlapping ipc observations listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] and shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the ipc ribs , which support the detector window , obscure @xmath630% of the nominal 1  square - degree field of the ipc .",
    "there is significant vignetting in the ipc ; effective exposure times at the edge of the field ( 30  arcmin from the center ) are about 50% of those on - axis .",
    "the ipc is sensitive to photons with energies between about 0.1 and 4.5 kev .",
    "active stellar coronae have characteristic temperatures of 10@xmath7k , or about 1  kev , and are well matched to the ipc response .",
    "the energy resolution of the ipc is about 100% , and only gross spectral information is available for weak sources .",
    "the 90% confidence uncertainty on the x - ray source positions is typically @xmath830 - 40  arcseconds .",
    "details of the ipc are given in giacconi _",
    "et al_.  ( 1979 ) .",
    "there are three x - ray sources in ipc sequence 3501 , centered on @xmath9  cra ( hd175813 ) .",
    "two of these were found in the standard rev  1b processing of sequence .",
    "the mdetect ( map detect ) source detection algorithm had not run as a part of the standard processing .",
    "we requested that mdetect be run off - line , and it yielded the third x - ray source . in ipc sequence 4512 ,",
    "centered on the cra dark cloud , the standard processing yielded 10 x - ray sources .",
    "all of the x - ray sources had potential optical counterparts on the poss sky survey .",
    "the w  uma star @xmath9  cra ( cruddace & dupree 1984 ) was detected in both ipc observations .",
    "the other x - ray sources , their j2000 coordinates , and aliases , are presented in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "we obtained low - dispersion spectra of these stars at the kitt peak national observatory in june 1983 , april 1986 , and may 1987 , using the intensified image dissector scanner ( iids ) on the 2.1-m telescope .",
    "all observations were made through the 7-arcsecond aperture .",
    "observations in the red covered the range 6150 - 7200  at about 3  resolution , and were obtained with grating  36 and the gg495 order - sorting filter .",
    "blue observations , taken using grating  36 and the cuso@xmath10 order - sorting filter , covered the range 3750 - 4200  with about 1.5  resolution .",
    "the spectra were fully reduced and wavelength- and flux - calibrated using the mountain data reductions and the ipps software package .",
    "flux calibration relied on the irs standard stars ( barnes & hayes 1982 ) .",
    "subsequent data analysis was performed using software written in idl .",
    "low - dispersion spectra were also taken on 18 and 23 july 1995 , and on 21 july 1996 , at the european southern observatory ( eso ) using the 1.52 m telescope equipped with a boller and chivens spectrograph .",
    "we used grating # 5 and ccd # 24 ( in 1995 ) or ccd # 39 ( in 1996 ) , achieving a mean resolution of about 2.5  ( fwhm ) in the 4600 - 7000  spectral range .",
    "this instrumental set - up allows us to resolve the lithium  i absorption line at 6707  from the ca  i absorption line at 6717  as well as to carry out an accurate spectral type classification . for the wavelength calibration",
    ", a he - ar exposure was taken after each science exposure .",
    "the standard stars ltt 4816 , ltt 7987 , and eg 274 were observed each night with the same instrumental set - up to perform the flux calibration .",
    "we used the midas software ( versions 95may and 95nov ) to reduce these spectra .",
    "bias and dark subtraction was first performed on each frame .",
    "the 2-d science frames were then divided by a mean flat - field and then calibrated in wavelength .",
    "the sky subtraction , the extraction of one dimensional spectra and the flux calibration using a mean response function , were finally performed .",
    "high - dispersion spectra were obtained using the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4-m echelle on 4 - 6 april 1987 and 23 - 27 may 1989 . using the red air schmidt camera with the 31.6 l / mm echelle , cross - disperser # 3 , the 200@xmath4 m slit , and the gg495 order sorting filter",

    "we subtracted the overscan region and the ccd bias and trimmed the frames using iraf .",
    "subsequent reductions were undertaken using an echelle data reduction package written in idl ( walter 1992 ) .",
    "the data were flux - calibrated using kopff  27 and ltt  3864 as flux - standard stars .",
    "most observations consisted of 3 sequential integrations ; cosmic rays were filtered out by applying a median filter to the multiple observations of each target .",
    "the 1987 observations were compromised by unusually large flexure within the spectrograph . in some cases",
    "flexure shifted the spectra off the region illuminated by the projector flat ( taken using decker 2 ) , resulting in lower s / n than indicated by counting statistics alone .",
    "radial velocities obtained during this run are unreliable , and have not been used .",
    "we obtained multiple high - dispersion single - order spectra of each star with the echelle spectrographs of the whipple observatory 1.5-m reflector and the mmt between 1986 and 1993 for the purpose of measuring radial velocities .",
    "all the spectra were centered at @xmath115187  and provided about 50  coverage .",
    "radial velocities were obtained via cross - correlation , following the procedures discussed by nordstrom _",
    "et al_.  ( 1994 ; see also latham 1992 ) .",
    "cross - correlations were made against a grid of synthetic templates with a separation of 250k in temperature , 0.5 in log g , and 10  in v  _ sin  i_. for each star the radial velocity was adopted for that template providing the highest value for the average of the correlation peak . the typical precision of a single radial - velocity measurement is 1  , based on the dispersions of repeated measurements .",
    "rotational velocities were determined through an interpolation based on correlation peak strength , with a measurement lower limit of @xmath12 10  .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of 5  .",
    "ubvri photometry was obtained in may 1986 , june 1987 , and may 1988 at ctio .",
    "the data were obtained with the 1.0-m telescope using a hamamatsu gaas photomultiplier and apertures ranging from 15 - 20  arcseconds .",
    "all ubv observations are on the johnson ( 1963 ) system , while all r and i observations are on the cousins ( 1980 ) system .",

    "additionally , a few ubv obsevations were obtained for us by dr .",
    "robert millis during may 1986 with the ctio / lowell 0.4-m telescope using an emi6256 photomultiplier .",
    "multiple , independent observations were obtained of each star during these observing runs with no obvious systematic differences in results between the various systems employed .",
    "further ubvri photometry was obtained from ccd images acquired at ctio on 1993 may 5 and 1994 june 3 using the 0.9 meter telescope .",
    "the detector used was the tek 2k-1 ccd with the standard bessell filter set .",
    "ccd debiasing and flat - fielding were performed using the iraf ccdred package .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were determined using the iraf apphot package .",

    "mean residual errors are less than 3% except in the case of the crapms  6 pair , which individually have mean residual errors of about 5% .",
    "we also obtained near - infrared jhkl photometry during june 1986 using the ctio 4-m telescope and during may 1989 using the ctio 1.5-m telescope . both observing runs",
    "employed a monolithic insb detector and used standards from elias _",
    "et al_.  ( 1982 ) to place the observations onto the standard system . at the 4-m telescope",
    "a 6-arcsecond aperture was used , while at the 1.5-m telescope a 14-arcsecond aperture was used .",
    "one to five independent observations were obtained of each program star .",
    "we obtained additional jhk observations on 19 - 21 february 1997 , using the cirim imaging detector on the ctio 1.5-m telescope .",
    "each image consisted of a raster of 6 exposures , with the telescope offset by 15  arcsec between exposures .",

    "we used the standard star observations to determine the extinction correction for each night and place the photometry on the standard cit system .",
    "uncertainties in the photometric solution amount to @xmath80.02  mag for single observations .",
    "target fluxes were measured in an 8  arcsec radius aperture . for close binaries we measured the relative fluxes in smaller apertures , and then corrected to the total flux of the system .",
    "we provide identifications for the low - mass stars following the iau convention ( dickel _ et al_.  1987 ) in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the identifications are the truncated j2000 coordinates .",

    "2 .   with the exception of crapms  1 , which appears significantly younger than the rest of the stars , the stars lie along a narrow locus .",
    "3 .   there is no evidence that the h@xmath3-emitting stars h@xmath3  6 and h@xmath3  11 are significantly younger than the other x - ray - selected stars .",
    "two of the x - ray sources are coincident with late - b stars .",
    "ty  cra ( b9v ) is an eclipsing triple system ( casey _ et al_.  1995 ) . with a mass of 1.6  m@xmath1 and an age of @xmath156  myr ,",
    "the secondary will be a g / k star similar to hde283572 ( walter _ et al_.  1987 ) , and can easily account for all the observed x - ray flux .",
    "the tertiary mass is less certain : casey _ et al_.  ( 1995 ) find 2.4  m@xmath1 , while corporon , lagrange , & beust ( 1996 ) find a mass of 1.2 - 1.4  m@xmath1 . in either case",
    "the tertiary is likely to be an x - ray source . both hr7169 ( b9v ) and hr7170 ( b8iv - v ) , a 13  arcsec visual pair ,",
    "are listed as spectroscopic binaries in the yale bright star catalog ( hoffleit 1982 ) ; further observations are needed to determine if there are low - mass stars associated with the hr7169/70 system .",
    "are late - b stars in star - forming regions bright x - ray sources ?",
    "a basic conclusion to be drawn from the einstein and rosat stellar x - ray observations is that all stars are x - ray sources  _ except the late - b to mid - a stars_. schmitt _ et al_.  ( 1993 ) observed the young lindroos ( 1986 ) pairs , consisting of a near - zero - age main sequence b star and a young late - type visual companion . using the rosat hri , with 3  arcsec positional accuracy",
    ", they showed that in 4 cases _ both _ the b star and the late - type companion ( ages less than 5@xmath2710@xmath7 years ) were x - ray sources .",
    "however , caillault , gagn , & stauffer ( 1994 ) have argued that the fraction of late - b / early - a stars in the orion nebula which are detected as x - ray sources is just that fraction expected to have late - type ( f5 or later ) binary companions .",
    "our data clearly do not help resolve the question of whether the late - b stars can be x - ray sources .",
    "the classical t  tauri stars s  cra and dg  cra , and the intermediate - mass stars r  cra and t  cra were within the area viewed by the einstein observatory .",
    "none were detected .",
    "the 2@xmath28 upper limit to the ipc count rates is given in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "the conversion from flux to counts depends on the assumed extinctions , which are poorly known .",
    "we assumed a coronal plasma at a temperature of 10@xmath7k .",
    "for a wide range of reasonable extinctions ( a@xmath29  10  mag ) , the count rate limits correspond to coronal luminosities l@xmath305@xmath2710@xmath31  erg  s@xmath24 .",
    "star formation in this cloud has been going on for a long time .",
    "the x - ray - selected stars , with ages extending upward to over 10  myr , appear significantly older than the b stars and imbedded sources .",
    "the narrow locus occupied by the stars in the luminosity - temperature diagram may be evidence for a burst of star formation about 7 - 10  myr ago , since younger stars will be more luminous , both at optical and x - ray wavelengths ( that the imbedded ir sources are not detected is a consequence of their high extinction and the relatively high limiting flux in these short observations ; koyama _ et al_.  ( 1996 ) and neuhuser & preibisch ( 1997 ) , using asca and rosat , respectively , have reported the x - ray detection of imbedded class  i protostars ) .",
    "however , given the small numbers , we can not rule out continuous star formation at a constant rate over the last 10  myr . given this population of older stars",
    ", it appears that the r  cra cloud is not simply a lower mass analog of the @xmath2  oph cloud ( wilking _ et al_.  1992 ) , but may represent a more evolved state of such a cloud .",
    "we observe 11 low - mass stars ( counting visual pairs as 2 stars , and neglecting the probable low - mass companions of the b stars ) in these 9 x - ray error circles . in previous studies of the x - ray emitting populations of star - forming associations ( walter _",
    "et al_.  1988 ; 1994 ) , we argued that the completeness of the x - ray sample is @xmath630% .",
    "this incompleteness has been verified in the taurus region by neuhuser _",
    "et al_.  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the same arguments hold here , implying that the total number of x - ray emitting low - mass pms stars in the @xmath61.5  square - degrees observed is about 30 . therefore the total number of low - mass stars in this association must be about 60 , or double that previously known .",
    "this is an underestimate of the total population of the r  cra association .",
    "the x - ray observations sampled only about 1.5  square degrees near the center of the cloud . over 10% ( 2 of 16 ) of those ir sources whose spectral energy distributions are consistent with their being pms stars ( wilking _ et al_.  1992  see figure  [ fig1 ] ) lie in the dark streamers to the east of the r  cra complex , near the b  cloud ( rossano 1978 ) and outside the einstein ipc fields .",
    "if the x - ray sources are spatially distributed in the same way , the total number of x - ray emitting low - mass pms stars must be increased by over 10% .",
    "note that neuhuser _",
    "et al_.  ( 1997 ) identified gsc  7916  0050 , 1.6@xmath0 to the southwest of r  cra and well outside the ipc fields , as a pms star .",
    "in addition , some fraction of the x - ray bright population will lie behind the dark cloud , and will not be detected because their x - ray fluxes lie below our flux limit . since 4 pms systems are projected against the near side of the cloud , we would expect about the same number , or about 30% of the total population , to be hidden from view .",
    "these corrections would increase the inferred x - ray bright population ( seen and unseen ) to about 40 stars , and the total population to about 70 stars .",
    "wilking _ et al_.  ( 1994 ) claimed , based on ir source counts , that the total stellar population in the core 0.24  pc@xmath32 of the cra complex is small ( @xmath630 stars ) , assuming a 2  myr age for the association . if the age is 10  myr , their ir counts permit up to 78 association members in this small region ( wilking , private communication ) .",
    "given the large uncertainties in the estimates and the differences in the volumes samples , there is no significant difference in the total population estimates from the ir or x - ray samples .",
    "the x - ray - bright population is observed to be more widely dispersed in space than the ir - selected population .",
    "this is to be expected if the x - ray - bright population is older , and has some non - zero velocity dispersion .",
    "some fraction of the total population may have dispersed outside the area we observed . to estimate the fraction of an old , dispersed population that should be visible within the volume sampled by the einstein observations",
    ", we modelled the association as a population with an age of 7  myr and a velocity dispersion of 1.7  km  s@xmath24 , and neglect gravitational decelerations .",
    "we assume that the stars all form within 1@xmath0 of the position of r  cra .",
    "if the star formation rate has remained constant over the past 7  myr , then about 70% of the members of the association will lie within the volume sampled .",
    "if the x - ray bright sample represents a short burst of star formation , with an age spread of 1  myr , then only 45% of the population lies within the area sampled . identifying the ir - bright sample with the youngest sources , and the x - ray bright sample with the non -",
    "imbedded older population , then the correction for the stars outside the ipc fields leads to an estimate of a total population of about 90 stars ( in the case of continuous star formation , n=70@xmath271.3 ; in the case of 2 episodes of star formation , n=30 + 40@xmath271.55 ) , with a likely uncertainty of @xmath820 stars .",
    "we are attempting to verify this estimate using an x - ray - selected sample of stars from observations with the rosat observatory ( walter _ et al_.  , in preparation ) .",
    "wilking _ et al_.  ( 1992 ) noted that 25% of the stars in this association are of intermediate - mass ( spectral types b8 to a5 ) , an unusually large number .",
    "other star formation regions ( e.g. , upper sco ; walter _ et al_.  1994 ) show initial mass functions ( imf ) similar to the field star mass function .",
    "if the r  cra imf is consistent with the miller - scalo ( 1979 ) field star mass function , and the intermediate mass stars all have masses greater than 2.5@xmath80.5  m@xmath1 , then one expects a total population of 92@xmath33 stars with m@xmath160.2m@xmath1 .",
    "given the uncertainties in both the extrapolation of the imf from 6 high mass stars and in our estimate of the low mass population , we see no evidence that the the mass function is abnormal . we conclude that the cra clouds have spawned of order 100 low - mass stars over the past 10  myr , and that there is no compelling evidence for an excess of intermediate - mass stars .",
    "we have identified 11 low - mass pre - main - sequence x - ray emitting stars associated with the r  cra star - forming region . with the exception of h@xmath3  6 , none of these stars have near - ir excesses attributable to warm circumstellar dust .",
    "none of the four classical t  tauri stars in the field were detected .",
    "x - ray emission was detected from the vicinity of the late - b stars ty  cra and hr  7169 , but the emission may be attributable to lower mass companions",
    ".    only 4 of the low - mass stars ( 2 in a close visual pair ) were previously known from optical work to be pms .",
    "the low - mass stars are significantly older than the 1 - 2  myr age inferred for the infrared sources and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the narrowness of the locus occupied by the x - ray - selected stars suggests an episode of star formation some 7  myr ago , but we can not exclude continuous star formation at a roughly constant rate over the past 10  myr .",
    "we estimate that the older ntt population dominates the total number of stars , and that the total pms population amounts to about 90 stars . given 6 intermediate - mass stars ,",
    "the number of low - mass stars is consistent ( within the large uncertainties ) with the field initial mass function .",
