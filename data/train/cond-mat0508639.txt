    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity @xcite the purse of identifying the microscopic mechanism for unconventional superconductivity such as @xmath7-wave in cuprates or @xmath8-wave in ruthenates has been a main driving force in condensed matter physics .",
    "even now , 19 years after the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity , it is an issue of hot debate whether the one - band ( two - dimensional ) hubbard model , the simplest model for electronic correlations , is becoming @xmath7-wave or -further away from half - filling- @xmath8-wave superconducting at low temperatures .    there are indications that there is indeed @xmath3-wave superconductivity close to half - filling .",
    "@xcite for example , the functional renormalization group ( frg ) predicts superconductivity for weak coupling.@xcite also numerical quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations for finite size systems @xcite observe an enhancement of the @xmath3-wave pairing .",
    "a promising method for addressing these questions is the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) , @xcite an extension of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft),@xcite which also takes non - local correlations and wave - vector dependences into account .",
    "this is essential for describing @xmath8- and @xmath7-wave superconductivity ; dmft itself only allows for @xmath9-wave superconductivity by construction .",
    "such dca calculations @xcite find @xmath3-wave superconductivity .",
    "however , when solving the dca equations numerically by conventional hirsch - fye qmc simulations @xcite one is restricted to rather high temperatures @xmath10.@xcite hence , a difficult extrapolation to low @xmath10 is necessary which is further hampered since ( numerically ) exact statements also require an extrapolation cluster size @xmath11 .",
    "our paper will focus on a different parameter regime : motivated by sr@xmath12ruo@xmath13 , many authors have recently addressed the possibility of triplet superconductivity in the two - dimensional one - band hubbard model with finite next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath14 ( the @xmath15-@xmath14 hubbard model ) at intermediate electron densities .",
    "the results have been controversial as regards the dominant pairing symmetry : frg calculations @xcite concluded that when @xmath16 and the fermi level is at the van hove ( vh ) singularity , the system becomes ferromagnetic at sufficiently low @xmath10 . while a @xmath7-wave phase spreads next to the ferromagnetic phase in the @xmath0-@xmath14 diagram for vh band fillings , a @xmath8-wave phase exists when going away from the vh band filling and for sufficiently large @xmath14 .",
    "third - order perturbation theory @xcite showed that triplet superconductivity is realized even when ferromagnetic spin fluctuation are not dominant . on the other hand",
    ", qmc,@xcite flex,@xcite and dca @xcite calculations concluded that triplet pairing does not become dominant for intermediate filling even when @xmath14 is as large as @xmath17 .",
    "it should be noted that frg , third - order perturbation theory and the flex approximation are valid only for weak coupling ; finite - size qmc is possible only for @xmath18 because of a serious negative sign problem;@xcite and the dca has been performed only for high @xmath10s.@xcite thus , the question concerning @xmath8-wave ( triplet ) superconductivity in the hubbard model is not conclusive yet .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new route to address this question , solving the dca equations by an extended version of the projective qmc ( pqmc ) method.@xcite this dca(pqmc ) approach mitigates the @xmath10-extrapolation problem of dca(qmc ) .",
    "we concentrate on the crossover between @xmath7- and @xmath8-wave instability in the intermediate electron density range @xmath19 and present results for the paramagnetic spectral function and the dominant pairing symmetry for @xmath20 and @xmath21 . on an equal footing with these pair susceptibilities",
    ", we also calculate the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin susceptibility of the dca cluster .",
    "the @xmath15-@xmath14 hubbard model reads @xmath22 here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 create and annihilate an electron with spin @xmath25 on site @xmath26 of the two - dimensional lattice ; the first and second sum are restricted to nearest neighbors ( nn ) and next - nearest neighbors ( nnn ) , respectively . in the following ,",
    "all energies are given in units of @xmath15 , corresponding to a bandwidth of @xmath27 .",
    "in the dca,@xcite the brillouin zone is divided into @xmath28 patches , with a coarse - grained green function @xmath29 and self energy @xmath30 for every patch @xmath8 : @xmath31^{-1}. \\label{dcaeq}\\ ] ] here , @xmath32 is the non - interacting green function and the @xmath33 summation averages over all @xmath34-points of patch @xmath8 which is centered around @xmath35 ; @xmath36 is the total number of all @xmath34-points . @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "then define an effective cluster of anderson impurities which can be described by the non - interacting green function @xmath39 or its fourier transform @xmath40 .",
    "this defines a cluster problem @xmath41 given by @xmath40 and a local coulomb interaction on every cluster site @xmath42 . in the dca",
    ", this cluster problem has to be solved self - consistently together with eq .",
    "( [ dcaeq ] ) .    here",
    ", we introduce a new cluster solver which is based on pqmc @xcite and particularly constructed for zero temperature .",
    "just as in ref .  , @xmath43 expectation values of an arbitrary operator @xmath44 are calculated as : @xmath45   } { \\operatorname*{tr}\\left [ e^{-\\tilde{\\beta}h_{t}}e^{-\\theta h_c } \\right ]   } .",
    "\\label{eq : projection}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is an auxiliary hamiltonian for which we take the cluster defined by @xmath40 without coulomb interaction ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the local one - particle potential of @xmath46 is adjusted self - consistently to yield the same @xmath1 as the interacting cluster @xmath41 . at least for @xmath48 ,",
    "this yields the same asymptotic behavior of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for large @xmath51 .",
    "hence , the influence of breaking time translational symmetry at @xmath52 is reduced .",
    "this gives a smoother green function in the vicinity of @xmath52 , but does not affect the results after long enough projection , i.e. , sufficiently away from @xmath52 .",
    "as in ref .  , the limit @xmath53 can be taken analytically for this @xmath54 .",
    "then , the interacting green function @xmath55 is obtained via the same updating equations for the auxiliary hubbard - stratonovich fields as for finite-@xmath10 qmc .",
    "but the pqmc starting point is different : a @xmath56 green function with open boundary conditions defined for @xmath57 , discretized into @xmath58 slices for @xmath59 cluster sites . for the measurement of physical quantities , @xmath60 central time slices are taken , and the remaining @xmath61 time slices on the right and left side of the measuring interval are reserved for projection . typically , we performed @xmath62 to @xmath63 qmc sweeps . to obtain @xmath64 from @xmath65 , the maximum entropy method ( mem )",

    "patches 2 , 3 , and 4 have contributions at the fermi surface and hence a contribution at @xmath71 .",
    "thereby , @xmath72 has a particular sharp peak because the vh singularity is located at @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this sharp peak also reflects in the fully @xmath34-integrated @xmath75 , shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "let us note that the quantitative and qualitative features are very similar to those of dmft ( dashed line ) ; there is no pseudo gap for @xmath76 in our @xmath56 dca(pqmc ) calculation .     for @xmath77 and the 6 ( out of 16 ) irreducible patches @xmath8 indicated in the inset .",
    "the inset also shows the non - interacting fermi surface as a line .",

    "to discuss the magnetic and pairing instabilities , we first calculate the corresponding susceptibilities @xmath79 for the @xmath80 cluster at self - consistency . here , @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the form factor , i.e. , @xmath83 second , we calculate @xmath84 from @xmath85 by mem and from this obtain the static susceptibility via the kramers - kronig relation @xmath86    in dca , the susceptibilities of the hubbard model are calculated from the above cluster @xmath87 by solving the bethe - salpeter equation.@xcite however , to this end it would be necessary to calculate susceptibilities for two @xmath51 s instead of eqs .",
    "( [ sus1 ] ) and ( [ sus2 ] ) which would tremendously increase the numerical effort .",
    "hence , we look at the cluster susceptibilities eqs .",
    "( [ sus1 ] ) and ( [ sus2 ] ) for simplicity .",
    "we can expect that this quantity already captures the essential features of the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation , or that between superconductivity with different symmetries .",
    "let us mention one more technical point : the decay of @xmath87 in @xmath51-space can be underestimated because of a finite number of projection time slices @xmath61 . in this case , the mem calculation of @xmath88 depends on up to which @xmath89 value the mem input @xmath85 is considered , see fig .",
    "( [ fig : chi ] ) . whenever we encounter a strong cutoff ( @xmath89-)dependence like in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] ( right inset ) we take a short cutoff @xmath89 ( only four @xmath51 points ) . with such a short cutoff @xmath89 which is very close to the asymptotical behavior @xmath90 , we certainly do not overestimate @xmath91 .",
    "however , if the weak decay of @xmath87 in @xmath51-space is not due to the finite @xmath61 but due to physics , we _ underestimate _ @xmath91 this way . in figs .",

    "consequently , the static susceptibility @xmath96 is basically @xmath89-independent in panel d ) and strongly @xmath89-dependent in panel e ) . in the following ,",
    "we indicate the problematic cases as in panel e ) by an arrow .",

    "let us finally turn to the physical results , starting with the ( inverse ) ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic susceptibilities plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : magsus ] as a function of @xmath10 for three exemplary parameter values ; finite-@xmath10 data have been obtained by conventional dca(pqmc ) .",
    "first of all , let us emphasize the obvious : dca(pqmc ) directly provides well for the @xmath56 susceptibilities _ without _ extrapolation -in very contrast to the finite-@xmath10 dca(qmc ) for which it is difficult to forecast / extrapolate the low-@xmath10 behavior . turning to the physical results , we see that the ferromagnetic spin susceptibility becomes larger than the antiferromagnetic one for @xmath97 .",
    "note that the vh filling is at @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , the frg studies @xcite found a strong ferromagnetic instability for @xmath100 at vh band fillings .",

    "[ fig : pairsus ] shows the inverse static pair susceptibilities as a function of @xmath10 .",

    "when we reduce @xmath1 to 0.6 , antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation become weak , see fig .",
    "[ fig : magsus ] .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath3-wave instability is still larger than those for triplet pairings .",
    "this is consistent with finite temperature dca calculation of ref .   for @xmath108 , and suggests @xmath3-wave ordering for low enough @xmath10 -even for far away from half - filling .",

    "reports also a ferromagnetic phase for @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , while there is possibly a @xmath7-wave phase for @xmath113 . on the other hand , third ordered perturbation calculations @xcite have shown that triplet superconductivity becomes dominant even for weak coupling .",
    "we find such triplet pairing only for smaller @xmath1 s , while the detailed structure of @xmath34-dependence of the vertex corrections may be essential which is possibly smeared out by the coarse - graining of dca .",
    "[ fig : phasdiag ] summarizes our main finding , i.e. , the dominant superconducting susceptibility on the cluster .",
    "we find that @xmath3-wave pairing is dominant in an unexpectedly broad range of fillings @xmath1 , whereas @xmath2-wave prevails only for small @xmath1 .",
    "the transition between @xmath2-wave and @xmath3-wave is at about @xmath114 .      the @xmath15-@xmath14 hubbard model with @xmath116 and",
    "@xmath117 has been considered to be a good model for the @xmath118-band of sr@xmath12ruo@xmath13.@xcite our dca(pqmc ) results indicate however that there is no triplet superconductivity for these @xmath1 and @xmath14 values , at least for the moderately strong values of @xmath0 we studied and which are e.g.considered in local density approximation ( lda)+dmft calculations.@xcite    hence our results suggest that a nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction @xmath119 , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , or a multi - orbital model is necessary for an appropriate description of triplet pairing in sr@xmath12ruo@xmath13 below @xmath120k .",
    "in contrast to the standard finite-@xmath10 dca(qmc ) , we can expect that dca(pqmc ) will open the door to such low temperatures -even for calculations with orbital realism .",
    "similarly , we can hope that dca(pqmc ) will allow for more definite statements concerning superconductivity in the two - dimensional hubbard model in the future .",
