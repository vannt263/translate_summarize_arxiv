    "<S> we propose the realization of linear crystals of cold ions which contain different atomic species for investigating quantum phase transitions and frustration effects in spin system beyond the commonly discussed case of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> mutual spin - spin interactions between ions can be tailored via the zeeman effect by applying oscillating magnetic fields with strong gradients . </S>",
    "<S> further , collective vibrational modes in the mixed ion crystal can be used to enhance and to vary the strength of spin - spin interactions and even to switch those forces from a ferro- to an antiferromagnetic character . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the behavior of the effective spin - spin couplings in an ion crystal of spin-@xmath1 ions doped with high magnetic moment ions with spin @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the ground state phase diagram and find regions with different spin orders including ferrimagnetic states . in the most simple non - trivial example we deal with a linear @xmath3ca@xmath4 , mn@xmath4 , ca@xmath5 crystal with spins of @xmath6 . to show the feasibility with current state - of - the - art experiments , we discuss how quantum phases might be detected using a collective stern - gerlach effect of the ion crystal and high resolution spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> here , the state - dependent laser - induced fluorescence of the indicator spin-@xmath1 ion , of species @xmath7ca@xmath4 , reveals also the spin state of the simulator spin-@xmath8 ions , @xmath9mn@xmath4 as this does not possess suitable levels for optical excitation and detection . </S>"
