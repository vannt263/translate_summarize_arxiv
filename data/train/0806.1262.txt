    "antiferromagnetic nanoparticles have been receiving a refreshed research attention over the last few years .",
    "these are considered as better candidates for exhibiting the magnetization reversal by quantum tunneling @xcite , due to their small magnetic moment as compared to the ferromagnetic nanoparticles .",
    "the magnetic properties of nanoparticles are dominated by finite - size effects , and the surface anomalies such as surface anisotropy and roughness.@xcite as the particle size decreases , the fraction of the spins lying on the surface of a nanoparticle increases , thus , making the surface play an important role .",
    "the reduced coordination of the surface spins causes a symmetry lowering locally , and leads to a surface anisotropy , that starts dominating as the particle size decreases .",
    "thus , an enhancement of surface and interface effects make the antiferromagnetic nanoparticles an interesting area of research.@xcite    nickel oxide ( nio ) has been considered as a prototype for antiferromagnetism , as it is one of the first few materials in which antiferromagnetism was studied.@xcite one of the first serious concerns with nio nanoparticle was , evidenced from the experimental study of richardson and milligan,@xcite that these nanoparticles show a large magnetic moment as the size becomes smaller than @xmath4 , apart from anomalous behavior of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "it was also found that the exchange coupling between the surface spins and the antiferromagnetic core spins causes an exchange bias phenomenon in these finite - sized particles .",
    "this phenomenon is responsible for the observed shifted hysteresis loop after field cooling in nio nanoparticles.@xcite this interface effect is very much size dependent .",
    "a large loop shift @xmath5 and coercivities at low temperature has been reported for the intermediate sized particles ( @xmath6).@xcite    winkler _ et al _ @xcite reported that for @xmath7 particles the magnetization curves are reversible above @xmath8 , but a hysteresis behavior is observed at lower temperatures . according to their observation",
    ", a large surface anisotropy is responsible for the anomalies in the shape of the hysteresis loop at low temperatures .",
    "they found that with a decrease in the temperature , a progressive blocking of the core particle moments starts off , and it is followed by a growth of spin clusters at the particle s surface below @xmath9 , and finally their collective freezing in a cluster glass - like state at @xmath10 .",
    "the net magnetic moment of antiferromagnetic nanoparticles has been a subject of research interest from a long time .",
    "nel in 1961 suggested @xcite that fine particles of antiferromagnetic materials exhibit weak ferromagnetism and superparamagnetism .",
    "he argued that the permanent magnetic moment in these antiferromagnetic fine particles is due to incomplete magnetic compensation between the atoms on the two sublattices ` a ' and ` b ' , which are identical in every respect , except that the atomic moments in b sublattice are antiparallel to that in a sublattice .",
    "nel considered three general cases as shown in ref .",
    "if the uncompensation of spins occurs randomly in a particle , then the number of uncompensated spins @xmath11 will vary as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the number of spins .",
    "if the spins are arranged in such a way that the ordered structure consists of odd number of ferromagnetic planes of a and b atoms , then @xmath14 . finally , if each plane consists of equal numbers of a and b atoms and the structure consists of incomplete top and bottom planes , then we would have @xmath15 .",
    "et al _ @xcite showed that @xmath15 from the size dependence of susceptibility in nio nanoparticles .",
    "thus , according to the nel s model , the magnetic moment @xmath16 for nio nanoparticles varies as @xmath17 .",
    "weak ferromagnetism was later confirmed by experiments @xcite on fine particles of nio . for extremely fine particles they reported the behavior to be superparamagnetic .",
    "however , tiwari _ et al _ @xcite argued that the nio nanoparticles behave like a superspin glass , which is attributed to a surface spin disorder .",
    "some authors accredited the large magnetic moment in nio nanoparticle to nonstoichiometry , an existence of small superparamagnetic metallic nickel clusters in nio particle or the presence of @xmath18 ions within the nio lattice.@xcite however richardson _ et al _ @xcite confirmed that the presence of @xmath18 in nio do not contribute significantly to the magnetic moment of nio nanoparticles . more recently",
    "et al _ @xcite investigated the size dependent magnetic properties of nio nanostructures using experimental and first principle study .",
    "they reported that nio clusters with a size upto @xmath19 indicate ferromagneticlike interactions with high magnetizations , and nio nanocrystals with a particle size over @xmath20 possess uncompensated magnetization .",
    "the magnetic moment per particle for nio has been investigated experimentally by kodama _",
    "et al_.@xcite from extrapolation of @xmath21 magnetization curves from a large magnetic field to zero field , they found 700 @xmath22 per particle for particles of size @xmath23 , while the nel s two - sublattice model @xcite predicts a magnetic moment of about 80 @xmath22 .",
    "for the particles of size @xmath7 , winkler _ et al _ @xcite experimentally found the magnetic moment per particle to be 500 @xmath22 , whereas for this particle size , the nel s model predicts a magnetic moment of 20 @xmath22 .",
    "this discrepancy , between the magnetic moments experimentally observed and those predicted by the nel s two - sublattice model has been a serious question from a long time .",
    "et al _ @xcite have shown from numerical modeling that a reduced symmetry on the surface of the nanoparticle actually causes a fundamental change in the magnetic order which results in a multi - sublattice structure .",

    "et al _ @xcite also reveals a distinct magnetic role of surface and core spins .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that the roughness at the surface layer gives rise to higher magnetic response for the surface spins than the core spins.@xcite    in view of these studies , we investigate the large magnetic moment in nio nanoparticle by invoking a different ordering for surface spins than the bulk nel state ordering for core spins .",

    "the nearest - neighbor interaction is linked by @xmath35 path @xmath34 , which is much smaller in strength . due to the lattice contraction",

    "a variational approach has been taken to find the dependence of the shell thickness on the size of particle .",
    "we have found that for nontrivial values of @xmath1 , the core interaction strength is modified which shows a signature of multi - sublattice ordering rather than two - sublattice ordering for smaller sizes .",

    "we have shown that the total magnetic moment calculated with ordered as well as disordered surfaces displays size dependent fluctuations .",
    "for an ordered surface case , smoothening these fluctuations by a window - averaging , using a lognormal size distribution of nanoparticles , results a magnetic moment per particle which is very close to observed experimental values of various sizes . we have also found that due to surface roughness effect , the net magnetic moment shows a trend where magnetic moment is very small for smallest size particles .",
    "increasing the size , magnetic moment increases and reaches a maximum at @xmath188 ( depending upon the distribution of sizes and oblateness of the particles ) , and again decreases towards the bulk value .",
