    "the critical behavior of systems with quenched disorder is of considerable theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "a typical example is obtained by mixing an ( anti)-ferromagnetic material with a nonmagnetic one , obtaining the so - called randomly dilute magnets .",
    "they are usually described by using the heisenberg hamiltonian with a random - exchange term @xmath2 where @xmath3 are @xmath4-component spins and @xmath5 are uncorrelated random variables , which are equal to one with probability @xmath6 ( the spin concentration ) and zero with probability @xmath7 ( the impurity concentration ) .",
    "the pure system corresponds to @xmath8 . the critical behavior of these systems is well established , both theoretically and experimentally , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein . in particular",
    ", a new random ising universality class describes the critical behavior of the random ising model ( rim ) above the percolation threshold of the magnetic atoms .",
    "the o(@xmath4)-symmetric hamiltonian ( [ lattmodel ] ) is a rather simplified model for real magnets . in particular",
    ", it does not take into account the presence of nonrotationally invariant interactions that have only the reduced symmetry of the lattice and that are due , e.g. , to the spin - lattice coupling and to dipole - dipole interactions . in this case , a more realistic hamiltonian is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the anisotropy coupling .",
    "for many materials @xmath11 is relatively small and thus one usually neglects these additional interactions .",
    "however , this is fully justified only if they are irrelevant in the renormalization - group ( rg ) sense .",
    "this issue may be investigated by considering the cubic - symmetric @xmath0 hamiltonian @xcite @xmath12 ^ 2 + { 1\\over 4 ! } w \\sum_{i=1}^m",
    "\\phi_i(x)^4 \\right\\ } , \\label{hphi4cubic}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is an @xmath4-component field and @xmath14 .",
    "analyses of high - order perturbative expansions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) show that the cubic - symmetric quartic @xmath15-interaction is relevant for @xmath16 , and in particular , for the physically relevant case @xmath17 . in this case",
    ", the nature of the transition depends on the sign of the coupling @xmath15 : if @xmath18 , the critical behavior is described by a new fixed point with reduced cubic symmetry , while , for @xmath19 , the rg flow runs away to infinity , and the corresponding system is expected to undergo a weak first - order transition . in the two - component case ,",
    "the o(2)-symmetric fixed point is stable with respect to the @xmath15-perturbation , and thus , if the transition is continuous , it belongs to the xy universality class .",
    "it is of interest to study the effect of quenched disorder on cubic magnets .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the critical behavior of these materials should be described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath20 where , beside the random - exchange term , a random - anisotropy term is present . here",
    "the anisotropy term @xmath21 is a random quantity that is traceless and has zero average .",
    "note that , for small anisotropy and weak disorder , this additional term should be smaller than the other ones , being , loosely speaking , proportional to the product of @xmath22 and @xmath10 , i.e. , it is a second - order perturbation of the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "this argument is not fully justified at criticality , since , if random anisotropy is relevant , it will eventually change the critical behavior .",
    "nonetheless , we expect  as we shall see , experiments confirm this assumption  a large preasymptotic region in which such term can be neglected . for this reason in this paper we will not consider the random - anisotropy term and we shall discuss the critical behavior of the model with hamiltonian ( [ lattmodel - cubic - random ] ) with @xmath23 .",
    "if only the random - exchange term is present , i.e. @xmath23 , the critical behavior of the model ( [ lattmodel - cubic - random ] ) can by studied using the field - theoretical hamiltonian @xmath24 ^ 2 + { 1\\over 4 ! }",

    "the original system , i.e. the randomly dilute @xmath4-component cubic model , is recovered in the @xmath29 limit.@xcite the coupling @xmath30 is negative , being proportional to minus the variance of the quenched disorder .",
    "the study of the effective hamiltonian @xmath31 in the limit @xmath29 provides also information on the critical behavior of the randomly dilute antiferromagnetic @xmath32-state potts model for @xmath33 and 3 , with hamiltonian @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath5 are uncorrelated random variables . indeed , as argued in refs .",
    "@xcite using rg arguments , the critical behavior of the antiferromagnetic three- and four - state potts models on a cubic lattice should be described by the cubic hamiltonian @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath17 respectively and with @xmath19 .",
    "the same correspondence holds in the random case .",
    "the randomly dilute three- and four - state models are respectively related to the two- and three - component model with hamiltonian ( [ hphi4 ] ) in the limit @xmath29 and for @xmath19 .    since disorder is coupled to the local energy density",
    ", one can use the harris criterion @xcite to predict the critical behavior of the model .",
    "it states that the addition of impurities to a system that undergoes a second - order phase transition does not change the critical behavior if the specific - heat critical exponent @xmath39 of the pure system is negative .",
    "if @xmath39 is positive , the transition is altered .",
    "this occurs in the ising case ( @xmath40 ) , where the addition of impurities leads to a new random ising universality class ( rim ) . in pure @xmath4-component cubic models ( @xmath41 )",
    "the specific - heat exponent @xmath39 is negative ; therefore , according to the harris criterion , the pure fixed point is stable against disorder .",
    "nonetheless , disorder may still have physical consequences .",
    "for instance , it may give rise to new fixed points or change the attraction domain of the pure stable fixed point .",
    "systems that are outside the attraction domain of the fixed point in the absence of disorder , and therefore show a fluctuation - driven first - order transition , may undergo a _",
    "second_-order transition in the presence of disorder .",
    "such phenomenon , usually referred to as softening , is well - understood in two - dimensional random - exchange models in which disorder is coupled to the local energy density .",
    "indeed , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later put on a rigorous basis @xcite , that in two dimensions thermal first - order transitions become continuous in the presence of quenched disorder coupled to the local energy density .",
    "for the cubic model ( [ hphi4cubic ] ) for @xmath42 , it was shown @xcite that such a softening persists in @xmath43 dimensions , while it is absent near four dimensions , see the @xmath44-expansion analysis of sec .",
    "thus , it is interesting to address this issue in three dimensions , where the analysis of ref.@xcite shows that the occurrence of softening may depend on nonuniversal features of the model .    in order to study the rg flow of the effective hamiltonian @xmath31 ,",
    "we consider the fixed - dimension perturbative method in @xmath1 and compute the rg functions perturbatively to six loops .",
    "the analysis of such series allows us to determine the rg flow .",
    "we briefly anticipate the main results of our analysis . the stability of the stable fixed points of the pure theory predicted by the harris criterion is confirmed .",
    "the region @xmath42 for any @xmath4 and the region @xmath19 for @xmath16 is outside the attraction domain of the stable fixed point for all physical values @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath4 there exists a fixed point in the rim universality class , which is weakly unstable ( i.e. with a very small crossover exponent ) and may give rise to observable crossover effects in physical systems .",
    "we do not find fixed points in the region @xmath42 for any @xmath4 and in the region @xmath19 for @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , no softening is expected , at least for sufficiently low impurity concentration to justify the field - theoretical approach . as for the three - state random potts model",
    ", it is expected to have an xy transition as in the pure case @xcite or a first - order transition , depending on the value of the effective negative coupling @xmath15 .",
    "the four - state random antiferromagnetic potts model is expected to undergo a weak first - order transition .",
    "we predict that cubic magnets with small positive anisotropy have a critical behavior controlled by the pure cubic fixed point , which has critical exponents very close to the heisenberg ones .",
    "therefore , experiments should effectively observe the standard o(3 ) critical exponents .",
    "this is in good agreement with the experiments that observe in most of the cases o(3 ) behavior with good accuracy , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . on the other hand , systems that tend to magnetize along the cubic axes ,",
    "should show a first - order transition , as in the pure case .",
    "experimentally , such a transition has never been observed , probably because of the smallness of the cubic anisotropy : due to the very small crossover exponent , @xmath46 , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , the cubic breaking can be observed only very close to the critical point , i.e. for @xmath47 , which is the limit of most of the experiments .",
    "as already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , _ a posteriori _ , the experimental results also confirm the validy of neglecting the random - anisotropy term in eq .",
    "( [ lattmodel - cubic - random ] ) in the experimentally relevant range of parameters .",
    "indeed , its presence would give rise to a crossover to a first - order transition in all cases @xcite .",
    "the associated crossover exponent is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the quadratic - anisotropy and specific - heat exponents for the heisenberg model .",
    "such an exponent is sizable and thus one should have been able to observe the random anisotropy if it were not very small .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "@xcite for the cubic hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "in this section we discuss some properties of the rg flow of the hamiltonian ( [ hphi4 ] ) for @xmath29 , using general arguments and known results holding for the special cases in which one of the quartic couplings vanishes .    the rg flow in the plane @xmath51 is that of the cubic hamiltonian ( [ hphi4cubic ] ) ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review of results ) .",
    "indeed , for @xmath51 the hamiltonian ( [ hphi4 ] ) describes @xmath52 decoupled @xmath4-component cubic - symmetric models . therefore ,",
    "in the plane @xmath51 there are four fixed points @xcite : the trivial gaussian one , the ising one in which the @xmath4 components of the field decouple , the o(@xmath4)-symmetric and the cubic fixed point .",
    "the gaussian fixed point is always unstable , and so is the ising fixed point for any number of components @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the stability properties of the o(@xmath4)-symmetric and of the cubic fixed point depend on @xmath4 . for sufficiently small values of @xmath4 , @xmath53 ,",
    "the o(@xmath4)-symmetric fixed point is stable and the cubic one is unstable . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the opposite is true : the rg flow is driven towards the cubic fixed point .",
    "figure  [ flowu0 ] sketches the flow diagram in the two cases @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "high - order perturbative computations in the @xmath44-expansion and in the fixed - dimension field - theoretical frameworks show that @xmath55 ; more precisely , @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "this means that the critical behavior of the two - component cubic model is described by the o(2)-symmetric fixed point and therefore belongs to the xy universality class . if @xmath54 , the cubic anisotropy is relevant and therefore the critical behavior of the system is not described by the heisenberg isotropic hamiltonian .    in the three - component case",
    "the cubic critical exponents @xmath57 , @xmath58 differ very little from those of the heisenberg universality class . indeed , the analysis of the six - loop fixed - dimension expansions of ref .",
    "@xcite reported in the appendix provides the following estimates for their differences @xmath59 note that these differences are much smaller than the typical experimental errors , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a list of experimental results , so that , at present , cubic effects are experimentally negligible . using the accurate estimates of ref .",
    "@xcite for the heisenberg exponents and eq .",
    "( [ diffexp ] ) , one obtains @xmath60 which are consistent with , but much more precise than , the results obtained from a direct analysis , see , e.g. , refs",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the stability of the pure fixed points against the @xmath30-perturbation can be inferred by using general arguments @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath30-interaction is the sum of the products of the energy operators of the different cubic @xmath4-component models , the crossover exponent associated with @xmath30 is given by the specific - heat critical exponent @xmath61 independently of @xmath52 , and thus also for @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the pure stable fixed point is stable with respect to random dilution for any @xmath62 , since the specific - heat exponent is always negative .",

    "it is characterized by the presence of two stable fixed points .",
    "the one for @xmath67 , @xmath68 is in the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) universality class , but it is irrelevant for our problem , since it is unreachable from the physical region @xmath45 .",

    "again , the flow is characterized by two stable fixed points : the saw and the o(@xmath4)-symmetric ones .    for @xmath38 and generic @xmath52",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hphi4 ] ) is invariant under the transformation @xmath69 for @xmath70 this transformation maps the ising fixed point into the cubic one , and the rim fixed point into a new one belonging to the region with @xmath45 , @xmath71 , @xmath19 . of course",
    ", corresponding fixed points describe the same critical behavior .    in conclusion ,",
    "the above - reported considerations show the presence of at least seven fixed points for @xmath16 and eight for @xmath38 using the above - mentioned symmetry .",
    "of course , other fixed points may lie outside the planes @xmath51 , @xmath65 , @xmath68 .",
    "thus , a more general analysis for generic values of the quartic couplings is necessary in order to obtain a satisfactory knowledge of the rg flow . in particular",
    ", this would allow us to investigate if random dilution may cause a softening of the first - order transition predicted for pure systems that are outside the attraction domain of the stable fixed point .",
    "for example , systems with @xmath42 might have a continuous transition if there exists a fixed point in the region @xmath45 , @xmath42 , while , for systems with @xmath16 and @xmath19 , softening to a continuous transition requires a fixed point in the region @xmath45 , @xmath19 .",
    "the rg flow of the randomly dilute cubic - symmetric model can be investigated near four dimensions using the first nontrivial terms of the expansion in powers of @xmath72 . using the results reported in refs .",
