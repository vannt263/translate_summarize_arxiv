    "we report on a search for upward - going electron - neutrino showers in the high - resolution fly s eye ii data set , and on the upper limit on the flux of @xmath0 set by the hires - ii detector .",
    "the hires project has been discussed previously @xcite ; the detector is an air - fluorescence detector located on two sites 12.6 km apart in utah at the u.s .",
    "army dugway proving ground .",
    "the hires - ii detector , located on camel s back ridge , is composed of 42 spherical mirrors of 3.7 m@xmath1 effective area covering nearly 360@xmath2 in azimuth .",
    "half of these , known as ring - one mirrors , cover between @xmath3-@xmath4 in elevation ; the other half ( ring - two ) cover between @xmath4-@xmath5 in elevation .",
    "cosmogenic neutrinos , with energies mostly in excess of @xmath6 ev , are produced via @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays following photopion production from high - energy cosmic ray protons incident on the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "there is evidence to suggest that gamma - ray bursts and active galactic nuclei jets are possible sources of high - energy cosmic rays and neutrinos @xcite .",
    "several theoretical limits on the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos have been proposed @xcite .",
    "although large uncertainties exist , neutrino cross sections have been calculated to vary from @xmath9 cm@xmath1 at @xmath6 ev to @xmath11 cm@xmath1 at @xmath12 ev @xcite .",
    "the opacity of the earth to neutrinos at these high energies therefore prohibits the detection of any upward - going event with an elevation angle larger than a few degrees .    in the charged - current interaction of a @xmath0 in the earth s crust",
    ", a high - energy electron will be created .",
    "the electromagnetic cascade generated by the electron will develop much more slowly due to the onset of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect .",
    "the lpm effect , first described classically by @xcite and later given a quantum - mechanical treatment by @xcite , predicts that the cross sections for bremsstrahlung and pair - production should decrease for a high - energy charged particle propagating in a dense medium , effectively slowing and elongating the development of the resulting shower of particles ( a detailed , more modern approach can be found in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the energy at which this effect becomes appreciable is inversely proportional to the square of the lorentz factor @xmath13 , and therefore the lpm effect should be much more pronounced for the showers generated from a @xmath14 charged - current interaction than for showers precipitated by @xmath15 or @xmath16 in the energy range in which hires is sensitive .",
    "it is most probable that a neutrino - induced electromagnetic cascade would be long and nearly - horizontal and observed primarily in the hires - ii ring - one mirrors . due to the lpm effect ,",
    "one expects electron - neutrino - induced showers that begin several tens to hundreds of meters deep in the crust to emerge with enough charged particles to be detected by hires - ii , thereby increasing the effective aperture of the detector at high energies .",
    "the entire hires - ii data set , which extends from late 1999 to spring 2006 , was considered when searching for evidence of neutrino - induced upward - going showers . using the standard routines that were developed for analyzing downward - going cosmic - ray events , we reconstructed the trajectories of each upward - going event based on the measured timing and geometry ( see @xcite for a description of time- and plane - fitting for extensive air showers ) .",
    "the data were then filtered in time and position to exclude all calibration laser events , which resulted in a loss in the detector aperture of less than 1% . additionally and consistent with standard procedure for the analysis of cosmic - ray data",
    ", events were rejected that passed within 100 meters of the detector , had track lengths smaller than 10@xmath17 , and that had geometrical uncertainties from timing greater than 36@xmath17 .",
    "at electron energies below the lpm threshold energy ( @xmath18 tev @xcite , where @xmath19 is the interaction length in cm ) , the longitudinal profile of an electromagnetic shower can be well approximated by the relation    @xmath20 \\right)\\right ] \\mathrm{.}\\ ] ]    this functional form was first described by @xcite , with @xmath21 as the log of the ratio of the energy of the incident electron to its critical energy @xmath22 , @xmath23 as the depth in radiation lengths and @xmath24}$ ] .",
    "this relation begins to break down at high energies , greatly underestimating the distance over which the electromagnetic cascade evolves due to the decrease in the cross sections for bremsstrahlung and @xmath25 pair production .",
    "studies of the electron shower profiles in rock , water and lead above the lpm threshold energy have been conducted previously @xcite . as expected ,",
    "the results of these analyses show that the shower profiles of electron - induced cascades are elongated significantly with respect to the greisen approximation at energies above the lpm threshold , and evolve differently based on the densities of the media in which the showers propagate .",
    "to simulate @xmath14-induced electromagnetic cascades , we used a four - step process .",
    "first , we calculated the average profiles of electron - induced showers using the lpm effect .",
    "we then used a monte carlo method to simulate the arrival directions and interaction points of @xmath14 around the hires detector .",
    "the shower profiles in air were then passed into the hires detector monte carlo to calculate the amount of light seen by the detector .",
    "the hires analysis programs were then run on the resulting monte carlo events to arrive at a @xmath14 aperture .      in order to treat charged - current @xmath26 interactions in the earth s crust , it is necessary to understand the physics of the transition of an electromagnetic cascade from a dense medium to a less dense medium ( namely , from rock to air ) .",
    "it is therefore important not only to know the number of charged particles after traversal of a given amount of material in rock , but also the energy spectrum of these particles as they leave the ground and enter the atmosphere .",
    "we followed the formalism of @xcite for calculating the energy - dependence of the probabilities for undergoing pair production and bremsstrahlung at lpm energies .",
    "taking into account any other losses ( e.g. compton scattering and ionization energy loss ) , we calculated two functions : @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which describe the average number of charged particles with energy @xmath29 resulting from the cascade of an electron , positron or photon with initial energy @xmath30 after traversing an amount of material @xmath31 in rock or air .",
    "the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 were determined for @xmath30 at every decade between @xmath34 and @xmath12  ev using our lpm calculation and from @xmath22 to @xmath34  ev using equation  [ eq : greisen ] ; lpm calculations of shower profiles from particles with initial energies below @xmath34  ev were found to be nearly identical to profiles calculated using equation  [ eq : greisen ] .",
    "we approximated the earth as a sphere with a radius equal to that at the dugway proving ground in utah .",
    "the density below 58.4  km beneath the surface ( mantle ) and the density from from 58.4  km to the surface ( crust ) were taken to be 4.60 and 2.80 g @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the atmosphere was also simulated up to a height of 50 km above sea level .",
    "electron - neutrino energies were considered from @xmath36 of 18 to 21 . the energy - dependence and inelasticity of the charged- and neutral - current @xmath37 interaction cross sections",
    "were calculated based on the pqcd cteq5 model @xcite . from the ratio of the cross sections for charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) interactions , 70% of the events were thrown as cc events , while the remaining 30% were considered nc events .",
    "neutrino arrival directions were chosen at random such that they only penetrated the atmosphere no more than 15@xmath2 below the horizon .",
    "events with elevation angles greater than 15@xmath2 do not contribute appreciably to the hires - ii total @xmath0 aperture due to the very small probability of their transmission through the crust and mantle and subsequent interaction near the detector ( a 10@xmath38  ev neutrino at 15@xmath2 has a probability of @xmath39 of transmission and interaction near the detector ; this value drops to @xmath40 at 10@xmath41  ev ) .",
    "the variables describing the geometry of the neutrino trajectory were determined , such as the distance of closest approach to the detector , the vector normal to the shower - detector plane , and the angle of the shower in the shower - detector plane .    for these earth - skimming events , the traversal of a critical amount of material @xmath42 ( measured in g @xmath43 )",
    "was found such that when the shower emerges from the rock into air , it contains at least @xmath44 charged particles ; showers with a maximum number of charged particles less than @xmath44 will not trigger the hires detector .",
    "this critical pathlength is used to separate the probabilities for neutrino transmission and interaction .",
    "the transmission probability @xmath45 , was calculated as the probability for a neutrino to penetrate up to @xmath42 .",
    "the interaction probability @xmath46 , was calculated from the pathlength of the neutrino from @xmath42 until escape from the atmosphere . since the amount of material traversed in the interaction region is always much less than the mean neutrino interaction length , the actual point of interaction for each neutrino",
    "was then chosen at random for distances @xmath47 .",
    "for neutrinos with small elevation angles that do not pass through the earth , we considered events that entered the atmosphere above the horizon as well as those that interacted below the horizon and yielded at least @xmath44 particles at the horizon . for events interacting below the horizon ,",
    "@xmath42 was taken to be amount of air penetrated at the horizon . in the case of events that entered the atmosphere above the horizon , we set @xmath45 to unity and calculated @xmath46 from the total distance traversed in the atmosphere .    for all @xmath14n interactions the energy transferred to the secondary electron or hadron",
    "was chosen from the inelasticity distribution ( @xmath48 ) for the pqcd cteq5 model . for earth - skimming cc events ,",
    "the resulting observable profile in air was found from a superposition of showers obtained from the energy spectrum of electrons , positrons and photons emerging from the rock .",
    "the profiles of cc events that did not pass through the earth were interpolated from the @xmath33 functions described in the previous section .",
    "the profiles for all nc events were calculated using the standard gaisser - hillas model @xcite . each profile",
    "was then weighted by a factor @xmath49 , to describe the total probability of transmission and interaction near hires - ii .",
    "figure [ fig : rocktoair ] shows the average profiles of five electron - induced air showers emerging from the ground at different depths along an average @xmath50  ev electron - induced shower in rock .      having generated shower profiles using the lpm effect , the shower profiles were then passed through a hires monte carlo program which models the response of the detector to cosmic - ray - induced showers .",
    "this program determines the amount of fluorescence and erenkov photons produced for a given number of charged particles , and scatters and attenuates the light appropriately when given the known variables describing the geometry of the shower with respect to the detector .",
    "the program then models the hires - ii trigger conditions to decide if the simulated shower is read out by the detector @xcite .",
    "simulated showers which triggered the detector were analyzed using the same routines used in the analysis of the real data used in our search for neutrinos in the upward - going hires - ii data .",
    "the variables describing the geometry of the shower were fit and compared to the known variables .",
    "an event was considered accepted when it passed the same cuts described in section 2 .",
    "for the purposes of arriving at a predicted hires - ii @xmath0 aperture , the simulated events were collected in 30 0.1-decade energy bins from @xmath6 to @xmath12  ev .",
    "the aperture for a given energy bin was found    @xmath51 ^ 2      r^2 \\left ( \\frac{\\sum _ i ^{n_a } w _",
    "i}{n_t } \\right)_e\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is the radius of the earth extended 50 km to the edge of the atmosphere",
    ". the geometrical component of the aperture is derived from the area and solid angle of a @xmath53 cap on a sphere of radius @xmath52 .",
    "this is then adjusted by the weighting factor @xmath54 ( discussed in section 4.2 ) for each of the @xmath55 events that trigger the detector out of a total @xmath56 events thrown in the given energy bin .",
    "the hires - ii @xmath0 aperture is shown in figure  [ fig : aperture ] .",
    "consistent with our study of @xmath16 @xcite , we calculate a flux limit in three energy bins : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59  ev , over the total hires lifetime of 3638 hours .",
    "we observe no neutrino events over the entire energy range .",
    "we calculate the flux limit ( @xmath60 ) at the 90% confidence level to be @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ev @xmath43 sr@xmath64",
    "s@xmath64 at @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67  ev , respectively . combined with our @xmath16 results and provided equal mixing of all neutrino flavors , this reduces the limit to @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ev @xmath43 sr@xmath64 s@xmath64 .",
    "as is the case with all high - energy neutrino calculations , the largest uncertainty lies in the extrapolation of @xmath37 cross sections .",
    "different cross section models can cause the limits to vary somewhat .",
    "the incorporation of cross sections from previous and more recent versions of the cteq model can change the limits by as much as 10 to 40% at the lowest and highest energies , respectively .",
    "recent work imposing the froissart bound on structure functions for extrapolating @xmath37 cross sections show a decrease in cross sections at @xmath12 ev by about a factor of 8 over the cteq5 parameterization @xcite .",
    "these cross sections increase our @xmath0 limit by 40% at the lowest energy bin and increase the value of our highest energy bin by a factor of  3 .",
    "in addition to uncertainties in @xmath37 cross sections , our limits are also sensitive to the energy transferred to the secondary electron or hadron . from parameterizations of the mean inelasticity in @xmath37 interactions",
    "@xcite , if we allow the transfer of exactly 80% of the neutrino energy to the electron ( and 20% to the hadron ) , our @xmath0 limits will increase between about 15% at @xmath65  ev , remain unchanged in the middle energy bin and decrease by about 5% at @xmath71  ev .",
    "we have found no evidence of upward - going neutrino - induced cosmic - ray showers in the hires - ii data .",
    "we have presented a technique for modeling the full hires - ii detector response to ultrahigh energy neutrino - induced lpm cascades in rock and air . with no neutrino events seen in the hires - ii data , and provided equal mixing of all neutrino flavors",
    ", we have found an upper limit on the flux of ultrahigh energy neutrinos at a 90% confidence limit .",
    "figure [ fig : flux_limit ] shows the upper limit on the neutrino flux from the analysis of the hires @xmath0 and @xmath72 flux limits as compared to three theoretical curves and to calculated flux limits from other experiments .",
    "the @xmath14 flux limits reported here have improved upon those for the fly s eye by about two and a half orders of magnitude . combined with the results of the @xmath16 analysis ,",
    "this limit lies just above the theoretical neutrino flux of @xcite , and about an order of magnitude above that of @xcite .",
    "our combined neutrino flux limit is about two and a half orders of magnitude above the cosmogenic neutrino flux predictions of @xcite , which has been derived from a proton injection model with cosmologically evolving sources and injection spectra that fit the hires cosmic - ray spectrum .",
