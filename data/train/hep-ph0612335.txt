    "quarks and gluons are the fundamental degrees of freedom in the study of strong interactions by means of qcd .",
    "nevertheless , the objects experimentally observable are hadrons and , at present , we have not yet a complete description of how hadrons are built up in terms of quark and gluon fields . in hard scattering processes we parameterize this non perturbative information through a set of parton distribution ( pds ) , which are hadronic matrix elements of bilocal products of the light - front quark and gluon field operators . at leading twist a quark - parton model of the nucleon",
    "requires three pds : the unpolarized distribution , @xmath1 , the helicity distribution , @xmath2 , and the transversity distribution , @xmath3 .",
    "whereas the first two distributions are well studied physical quantities , both from the experimental and theoretical point of view , so far , the last one is totally unknown . as a matter of fact , @xmath3 does not contribute to inclusive deep - inelastic scattering because of its chiral - odd nature and is only experimentally accessible when coupled to another chiral - odd partner in the cross section .",
    "notwithstanding , some theoretical activity has been developed to calculate it and to suggest some new experimental ways to extract @xmath3 from data  @xcite . among all the proposed experimental investigations ,",
    "the favorite one is represented by the double transversely polarized drell  yan dilepton production  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this allows the study of the double transverse - spin asymmetry of lepton - pair production , giving direct access to the transversity distribution .    in recent years",
    "a novel class of parton distributions has been introduced , the generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite .",
    "the gpds have attracted a considerable amount of interest , since it has been pointed out that they contain a wealth of information about the internal structure of hadrons , interpolating between the inclusive physics of parton distributions and the exclusive limit of form factors@xcite .",
    "these new parton distributions functions are defined as non - diagonal hadronic matrix elements of bilocal products of the light - front quark and gluon field operators .",
    "a complete set of quark gpds at leading twist include four helicity conserving , usually labeled @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and four helicity flipping chiral - odd gpds , labeled @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11@xcite . in the forward limit , @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath8",
    "reduce to @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "a variety of model calculations is available for helicity conserving gpds .",
    "less attention has been paid up to now to the chiral - odd sector .",
    "so far , there is only one proposal to access the chiral - odd gpds in diffractive double meson production  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the chiral - odd gpds by means of the overlap representation of light - cone wave functions ( lcwfs ) that was originally proposed in refs .  @xcite . in a fully covariant approach",
    "the connection between the overlap representation of gpds and the non - diagonal one - body density matrix in momentum space has further been explored in refs .",
    "@xcite for the helicity conserving sector , making use of the correct transformation of the wave functions from the ( canonical ) instant - form to the ( light - cone ) front - form description . in this way",
    "the lowest - order fock - space components of lcwfs with three valence quarks are directly linked to wave functions derived in constituent quark models ( cqms ) .",
    "recently this approach has been extended to include the next - order fock - state component , by developing a convolution formalism for the unpolarized gpds which incorporate the sea quark distribution  @xcite .    in this paper , following the approach discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the four chiral - odd gpds are derived in sec .  2 by means of a fock - state decomposition in the transverse spin basis and with lcwfs for three valence quarks .",
    "in sec .  3 we present the numerical results obtained for the gpds , while we show our estimations for the transversity distributions in sec .  4 and some predictions for the double transverse - spin asymmetry in drell ",
    "yan dilepton production in sec .  5 .",
    "the chiral - odd gpds are off - diagonal in the parton helicity basis . in the reference frame where the momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the initial and final nucleon lie in the @xmath17 plane",
    ", they become diagonal if one changes basis from eigenstates of helicity to eigenstates of transversity , i.e. states with spin projection @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) directed along ( opposite to ) the transverse direction @xmath20 . in such a basis",
    "they are obtained by means of the following relations @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transferred momentum square , @xmath23 is its minimum value for a given value of the skewness parameter @xmath24 defined in terms of the momentum transfer @xmath25 and the average nucleon momentum @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the @xmath29-component of @xmath30 .",
    "the transverse matrix elements are defined as follows @xmath31 in the region @xmath32 of plus - momentum fractions , where the generalized quark distributions describe the emission of a quark with plus - momentum @xmath33 and its reabsorption with plus - momentum @xmath34 , they can be written in the overlap representation of lcwfs as @xmath35_n[d^2\\vec{k}_\\perp]_n\\delta(\\bar{x } - \\bar{x}_j)\\psi^{*}_{\\lambda'_t , n,\\beta'}(\\hat{r } ' ) \\psi_{\\lambda_t , n,\\beta}(\\tilde{r } ) , \\\\ & & \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : ttilde_ov } \\tilde{t}^{q } _ { \\lambda'_t\\lambda_t } & = & \\sum_{\\beta,\\beta',n } \\bigg(\\sqrt{1 - \\xi}\\bigg)^{2 - n}\\bigg(\\sqrt{1 + \\xi}\\bigg)^{2 - n } \\sum_{j=1}^n\\delta_{{\\mu_j^t}'-\\mu_j^t}\\delta_{{\\mu_i^t}'\\mu_i^t}\\mathrm{sign}(\\mu_{j}^{t } ) \\delta_{s_jq}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\int[d\\bar{x}]_n[d^2\\vec{k}_\\perp]_n\\delta(\\bar{x } - \\bar{x}_j)\\psi^{*}_{\\lambda'_t , n,\\beta'}(\\hat{r } ' ) \\psi_{\\lambda_t , n,\\beta}(\\tilde{r}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the momentum lcwf of the @xmath37-parton fock state , @xmath38 labels the quantum numbers of the @xmath39-th active parton , with transverse initial ( final ) spin polarization @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , and @xmath42 are the transverse spin of the spectator initial ( final ) quarks .",
    "the set of kinematical variables @xmath43 are defined according to refs.@xcite .",
    "as an application of the general formalism we consider the valence - quark contribution ( @xmath44 ) to the chiral - odd gpds with the lcwf derived starting from an instant - form of the proton obtained in the relativistic quark model of ref.@xcite .",
    "the structure of the nucleon wave function in this model is su(6 ) symmetric for the spin - isospin components .    as an example we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] the four calculated chiral - odd gpds , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 at @xmath49 ( gev)@xmath50 and for different values of @xmath51 . in all cases",
    "the gpds vanish at @xmath52 since in our approach they include the contribution of valence quarks only and we can not populate the so - called erbl region with @xmath53 where quark - antiquark pairs and gluons are important . therefore , at low @xmath54 this gives a strong @xmath51 dependence of the peak position of the distribution , but for large @xmath54 the @xmath51 dependence turns out to be rather weak . concerning the @xmath55 dependence , it affects the low-@xmath54 region and is more pronounced in the cases of @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for large @xmath54 values the decay of all the distributions towards zero at the boundary",
    "@xmath58 is almost independent of @xmath55 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "in the forward limit @xmath59 ( @xmath60 , with @xmath29 being the usual bjorken variable ) , only the quark gpd @xmath61 can be measured and , in fact , becomes the quark transversity distribution @xmath62 .",
    "although the quark gpds @xmath63 and @xmath64 do not contribute to the scattering amplitude , they remain finite in the forward limit , whereas @xmath65 vanishes identically being an odd function of @xmath51 as already noticed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the transversity distribution @xmath66 is the counterpart in the transverse - polarization space of the helicity parton distribution @xmath67 which measures the helicity asymmetry . as it was stressed by jaffe and ji@xcite , in nonrelativistic situations where rotational and boost operations commute , one has @xmath68",
    ". therefore the difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 is a measure of the relativistic nature of the quarks inside the nucleon . in light - cone cqms",
    "these relativistic effects are encoded in the melosh rotations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] the helicity and transversity distributions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , obtained as a forward limit of the corresponding gpds calculated with the cqm of ref.@xcite , are compared and plotted together with the nonrelativistic result when melosh rotations reduce to identity .",
    "the large difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 shows how big is the effect of relativity .",
    "recalling the expression for the unpolarized parton distribution @xmath69 obtained in ref.@xcite , it is easy to see that the following relations hold @xmath70 which are compatible with the soffer inequality@xcite . in the nonrelativistic limit one obtains @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "in order to directly access transversity via drell - yan lepton pair production one has to measure the double transverse - spin asymmetry @xmath73 in collisions between two transversely polarized hadrons:[dsa]a_tt = , with the arrows denoting the transverse directions along which the two colliding hadrons are polarized .",
    "the most favorable situation for a sizeable effect is the process @xmath74 mediated by a virtual photon@xcite . at lo , i.e. considering only the quark - antiquark annihilation graph , the double transverse - spin asymmetry for this process is given bya_tt^p|p= a_tt , where @xmath75 is the quark charge , @xmath76 the invariant mass square of the lepton pair ( dimuon ) , and @xmath77 the spin asymmetry of the qed elementary process @xmath78 .    here , as in ref.@xcite",
    ", we provide quantitative estimates of @xmath79 for the kinematics of the proposed @xmath0 experiment at gsi . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] our predictions for @xmath79 are plotted in terms of the rapidity @xmath80 , where the transversity distribution has been suitably evolved solving numerically the dglap equations@xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ) and where the unpolarized distribution functions @xmath81 are taken from the grv parameterization@xcite .",
    "one may notice that our predictions for @xmath79 are much lower than the results obtained in others phenomenological analysis  @xcite .",
    "however , our study suggests the possibility of a measurable asymmetry , about 20% , at moderate @xmath76 values , around 5@xmath8210 gev@xmath50 , giving direct access to the transversity distribution .",
