    "in particular , upon lowering the coupling constant @xmath71 , the condensation will start at a critical coupling @xmath72 , when the condition ( [ eqtc ] ) is first satisfied .",
    "the theoretical approach developed in section [ formulation ] , can be used to explore the normal phase of a homogeneous bose - fermi mixture at arbitrary values of the boson and fermion masses and densities . in this section , where we present finite - temperature results",

    "figure [ tc_8740 ] presents the dependence of the condensation critical temperature on the boson - fermion coupling @xmath74 for a @xmath0rb @xmath1k mixture , at different values of the density imbalance @xmath75 .",

    "the matching between finite - temperature and zero - temperature results confirms the validity of the equations derived in the zero - temperature limit , while providing simultaneously a check of the numerical calculations .",
    "the overall behavior of the critical temperature as a function of coupling is similar to what found for equal masses  @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature starts from the noninteracting value ( @xmath77 ) in the weak - coupling limit and eventually vanishes at a critical coupling @xmath72 , when the effect of the boson - fermion coupling is so strong that the bose - einstein condensate is completely depleted , in favor of the formation of molecules .",
    "the weak dependence of the critical coupling on the density imbalance previously found for equal masses is confirmed also for this case with different masses . in this case , the critical coupling varies in the range @xmath78 , to be compared with the range @xmath79 found for @xmath80 .",
    "a minor difference with respect to the case with equal masses is finally the presence of a weak maximum in the critical temperature , which reaches a value slightly above the noninteracting value @xmath81 before its final decrease .",
    "this feature is more pronounced for intermediate values of the density imbalance .",
    "we attribute this feature to the delicate balance between the effects of the boson - fermion interaction on the boson dispersion , and the condensate depletion due to molecular correlations .",
    "the boson dispersion may in fact be hardened by the interaction ( similarly to what one finds for a dilute repulsive bose gas @xcite ) , thus leading to an increase of the critical temperature .",
    "the predominance of one effect over the other one depends on a fine tuning of the mass ratio and density imbalance , and may explain the different behavior found for different values of these parameters .",
    "figure [ mutc_8740 ] reports the coupling dependence of the chemical potentials @xmath82 and @xmath83 at the critical temperature for a @xmath0rb @xmath1k mixture at the same values of the density imbalance considered in fig .",

    "the fermion chemical potential ( reported in the inset ) remains instead almost constant across the whole resonance .",
    "the decrease of the chemical potential due to the attractive interaction with the bosons is , in fact , partially compensated by the decreasing of the temperature when moving along the critical line ( which increases @xmath83 ) and by the pauli repulsion between unpaired fermions and bose - fermi pairs .",
    "the behavior of the critical temperature as a function of the boson - fermion coupling discussed in the previous section , evidenced the presence of a quantum phase transition at zero temperature associated with a transition between a superfluid phase with a boson condensate to a normal phase , where the condensate is completely depleted . in this section",
    "we examine in more detail this quantum phase transition by solving numerically the equations formulated at exactly zero temperature .",
    "figure [ gc_massb ] reports the critical coupling @xmath72 as a function of the mass ratio @xmath86 , with two distinct panels for the cases @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the different curves reported in fig .  [ gc_massb ] correspond to different values of the density imbalance , ranging from the density - balanced case to the fully imbalanced one @xmath89 , which represents the system with just one boson immersed in a fermi sea .",
    "this is actually the same as a spin - down fermion sorrounded by a fermi sea of spin - up fermions , since for a single particle the statistics is irrelevant .",
    "the critical coupling reduces thus to that for the polaron - to - molecule transition , recently studied in the context of strongly imbalanced two - component fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "the equations governing the one boson limit are reported in the appendix .",
    "the critical coupling is strongly influenced by the mass ratio , especially for @xmath90 . in this case , for all values of the density imbalance , @xmath72 increases very rapidily as @xmath86 is decreased . for the single boson problem , an asymptotic expansion of the equations determining @xmath72 for @xmath91 yields the result @xmath92 which proves quite accurate",

    "@xcite , for a mass ratio @xmath96 the molecular state acquires a finite momentum in its ground state .",
    "similar results were obtained in ref .",
    "the equations for the single boson problem here adopted assume that the formation of the molecule occurs at zero center of mass momentum ( as in refs .  ) .",
    "the curve corresponding to the single boson problem in fig .  [ gc_massb ] may thus change for @xmath97 , after taking into account the possibility of pairing at finite momentum .",
    "we expect however this change to be minor on the basis of our calculations with a finite boson density , which allow for pairing at finite momentum and yield results close to the single - boson curve also for @xmath98 .",
    "note further that the study of the three body system with two equal fermions with mass @xmath99 and one different particle with mass @xmath100 interacting through a zero - range potential , shows that for @xmath101 the system is unstable due to a sequence of three - body bound states with energy @xmath102.@xcite a similar instability is expected to occur also in the many - body system with @xmath103 equal fermions plus one different particle ( a recent work has proven indeed that the above critical value for the three - body system provides a lower bound for the location of the instability in the many - body system @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that the unboundness from below of the efimov spectrum ( and the associated global instability ) occurs only for a pure zero - range interaction . in a real system",
    ", physical two - body interactions will provide a natural cut - off at distances of the order of the van - der - waals length @xmath104 , thus limiting the position of the lowest efimov level at an energy @xmath105 .",
    "the global mechanical instability is thus avoided by the real system , even though the presence of efimov states is expected to lead to an enhancement of three - body losses when they lie close to the three - particle or atom - dimer continuum .",
    "we further note in this context that the presence of the ( non - universal ) three - body bound - states recently found by kartavtsev and malykh @xcite for @xmath106 could also lead to enhanced three - body losses in this mass - ratio range .",
    "we observe in any case that since our calculations were taken for @xmath107 ( @xmath108 for equal densities , due to numerical difficulties ) , the above three - body effects ( which are out of the scope of the present theory ) should affect our study only marginally .",
    "consistently with our previous results , we observe a weak dependence of @xmath72 on the density imbalance .",
    "such a weak dependence on the densities remains valid also for @xmath109 . in this case , all curves reach a minimum value of @xmath72 ( = 1.2@xmath1101.3 ) for mass ratios @xmath111 in the range 3.5@xmath1105 , after which they increase slowly with the mass ratio . for the single boson problem with a large mass we have obtained the asymptotic expression ( see appendix ) : @xmath112 where @xmath113 one can see from eqs .",

    "equation  ( [ asylarge1 ] ) , which includes the first two corrections to the leading behavior , provides a better approximation , the deviation from the numerical solution being 15% for @xmath115 and 1.5% for @xmath116 .",
    "the increasing behavior of @xmath72 at both small and large mass ratios implies the existence of a minimum in the curve for @xmath72 at intermediate mass ratios , consistently with the results of fig .",
    "[ gc_massb ] .",
    "note however that in earlier work for the polaron - molecule transition , the critical coupling for the transition was found to move away from the bec limit for increasingly heavier impurities . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite reported that the critical coupling should approach the unitary limit for an infinitely heavy impurity .",
    "similar results were also found in two - dimensions by m. parish  @xcite ( with the critical coupling approaching the weak - coupling limit in this case ) .",
    "a reason for such a difference may be that our theory in the limit of a single boson reduces to the `` first level approximation '' of ref .",
    "@xcite , with no particle - hole dressing of the molecule ( while the polaron is described with the same accuracy obtained with the variational wave - function introduced by chevy @xcite , which is deemed quite accurate for the polaron energy  @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite includes instead a particle - hole dressing of the molecule .",
    "this inclusion is sufficient to recover in the strong - coupling limit the correct dimer - fermion scattering length , and shifts the position of the critical coupling for equal masses from the value @xmath117 to the value @xmath118 ( the factor @xmath119 appears here because of a different definition of @xmath120 between us and the above references ) .",
    "the eventual ( slow ) increase of @xmath72 at large mass ratios could then be an artifact of the `` first order approximation '' .",
    "calculations at large mass ratios with alternative methods ( such as fixed - node or diagrammatic quantum monte - carlo methods ) could definitively clarify this issue .    at equal densities , our results for @xmath72 as a function of the mass ratio agree well with the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the same case .",

    "only when @xmath123 is small , apparently it leads only to minor differences in the values for @xmath72 .",
    "for instance , for equal masses and densities we obtained @xmath124 , to be compared with @xmath125 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    according to the analysis of ref .",

    "the second - order quantum phase transition between a condensed phase and a normal phase is in fact superseded by a phase separation between the two phases .",
    "according to our calculations , the compressibility matrix @xmath127 is always positive in the normal phase , indicating that the second order phase transition here explored lies , at worst , in a metastable region of the phase diagram . in order to examine its absolute stability within our approach",

    "this nontrivial extension is postponed to future work .",
    "we observe however , that if ratios @xmath128 of the order of 0.2 - 0.3 are sufficient to suppress phase separation in most of the phase diagram ( as the results of ref .",

    "the critical temperature starts from the noninteracting value ( @xmath77 ) in the weak - coupling limit and eventually vanishes at a critical coupling @xmath72 , when the effect of the boson - fermion coupling is so strong that the bose - einstein condensate is completely depleted .",
    "the critical temperature presents a weak maximum at intermediate coupling , not found for equal masses .",
    "we have explained this feature as resulting from the balance between the hardening of the boson dispersion due to the boson - fermion interaction , and the condensate depletion due to molecular correlation .",
    "the predominance of one effect over the other one depends on a fine tuning of the physical parameters , thus explaining the different behavior found for different cases .",
    "we have then considered the zero - temperature limit .",
    "we have found that the critical coupling @xmath72 is significally affected by the mass imbalance , in particular for @xmath90 . in this case , for all values of the density imbalance , we have obtained a rapid increase of @xmath72 as @xmath91 .",
    "we have also found that the density imbalance influences only weakly the critical coupling , as previously found for equal masses  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a sufficiently large density imbalance produces quite a remarkable effect on the bosonic momentum distribution function .",
    "we have found indeed that this function is completely depleted for momenta with magnitude below a certain value @xmath151 .",
    "this value is set by the difference between the fermi momenta associated with the unpaired fermions and the composite - fermions , respectively .",
    "such a momentum distribution function reflects the constraints on the internal molecular wave - function imposed by the presence of a large fermi surface associated with the unpaired fermions . in this respect ,",
    "the physics underlying this phenomenon is similar to that of the `` sarma phase '' for a highly - polarized fermi gas in the strong - coupling limit of the bcs - bec crossover  @xcite . in particular , the bosonic momentum distribution function is similar to the momentum distribution function of the minority species in a polarized fermi gas .",
    "interestingly , the fact that in the present case the molecules can not condense , but rather fill a fermi sphere , smears some features of the momentum distribution function , but still preserves the presence of an empty region in the momentum distribution function .",
    "such an interesting effect could be measured in a bose - fermi mixture in the molecular limit by using the same technique used to measure the momentum distribution of an ultracold fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover  @xcite .",
