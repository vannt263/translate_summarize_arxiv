    "physics in extremely high energy regions is particularly of interest to particle physics .",
    "string theory is one of the most successful theoretical frameworks which overcome the difficulty of ultra - violet divergence in quantum theory of gravity .",
    "however it has many difficulties in performing practical computations .",
    "therefore if we construct a field theory which captures some stringy nature and/or includes stringy corrections , then it would play a pivotal role in investigating physics in high energy regions even near the planck scale .",
    "some of the stringy corrections appear as @xmath3 corrections .",
    "in other words , it often takes the form as higher derivative corrections i.e. higher order polynomial of momentum .",
    "one of the way to discuss these corrections is deforming the heisenberg uncertainty principle to a generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) : @xmath4 where @xmath2 is a deforming parameter .",
    "this parameter has the dimension of @xmath5 and its square root gives the minimal length scale of the theory under consideration .",
    "if it is realized in a certain string theory context , @xmath2 would take a value of order the string scale ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this relation comes from various types of studies such as on high energy or short distance behavior of strings @xcite , @xcite , gedanken experiment of black hole @xcite , de sitter space @xcite and the symmetry of massless particle @xcite .",
    "there are several canonical commutation algebra which lead to the gup . among these algebra",
    "we will focus on the algebra : @xmath7=i\\hbar ( 1+\\beta \\hat{p}^2 ) .",
    "\\label{deformed alg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this algebra is investigated in @xcite-@xcite and an attempt to construct a field theory with minimal length scale is found in @xcite . in their work",
    "they quantize fields using the bargmann - fock representation in 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "this has also been used in cosmology , especially in physics at an early universe ( see for example , @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the quantization of fields based on the deformed algebra ( [ deformed alg ] ) in the canonical formalism in 1 + 1 dimensions and in the path integral formalism as well . in the process of quantization using the latter formalism , we use the bjorken - johnson - low prescription @xcite which states that t - product of fields must take same value in the two formalism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first introduce a hilbert space definitely in terms of the maximally localized states which satisfy minimal uncertainty in position space @xcite . in section 3 ,",
    "we quantize fields in 1 + 1 dimensions in the canonical formalism , where the maximally localized states are taken to be one particle states . in section 4 ,",
    "we construct 1 + 1 dimensional quantum field theory in the path integral formalism so that it is equivalent to that in the canonical formalism .",
    "we find that higher dimensional extension is straightforward in the path integral formalism .",
    "we start with the following deformed heisenberg algebra @xcite : @xmath7=i\\hbar ( 1+\\beta \\hat{p}^2 ) , \\label{gup}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has a representation in momentum space : @xmath8 in general , states which have minimal uncertainty obey the following equation : @xmath9\\rangle}{2(\\delta p)^2}\\delta \\hat{p}\\bigr)|\\psi \\rangle & = & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 among these states , we will focus on the states which are subject to the following conditions : @xmath11    ( 1500,900)(0,0 ) = cmr10 at 10pt ( 141.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 121,123)(0,0)[r ] 0 ( 1419.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 141.0,246.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 121,246)(0,0)[r ] @xmath12 ( 1419.0,246.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 141.0,369.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 121,369)(0,0)[r ] 2@xmath12 ( 1419.0,369.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 141.0,491.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 1419.0,491.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 141.0,614.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 121,614)(0,0)[r ] 4@xmath12 ( 1419.0,614.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 141.0,737.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 121,737)(0,0)[r ] 5@xmath12 ( 1419.0,737.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 141.0,860.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 121,860)(0,0)[r ] 6@xmath12 ( 1419.0,860.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 141.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 141,82)(0,0 ) 0 ( 141.0,840.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 271,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 265,246)(0,0 ) @xmath13 ( 300,210)(0,0 ) @xmath14 ( 590,190)(0,0)`maximal localization states ' ( 271,82)(0,0 ) @xmath15 ( 401.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 401,82)(0,0 ) @xmath16 ( 401.0,840.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 660.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 660,82)(0,0 ) @xmath17 ( 660.0,840.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 920.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 920,82)(0,0 ) @xmath18 ( 920.0,840.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 1179.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 1179,82)(0,0 ) @xmath19 ( 1179.0,840.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 1439.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 1439,82)(0,0 ) @xmath20 ( 1439.0,840.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 141.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 1439.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 141.0,860.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 40,491)(0,0)@xmath21 ( 790,21)(0,0)@xmath22 ( 141.0,123.0 )    ' '' ''    ( 154,737 ) ( 154.58,698.52)(0.493,-11.796)23    ' '' ''    ( 153.17,717.76)(13.000,-278.761)2    ' '' ''    ( 167.58,426.45)(0.493,-3.748)23    ' '' ''    ( 166.17,432.73)(13.000,-88.725)2    ' '' ''    ( 180.58,337.96)(0.493,-1.726)23    ' '' ''    ( 179.17,340.98)(13.000,-40.982)2    ' '' ''    ( 193.58,296.74)(0.494,-0.864)25    ' '' ''    ( 192.17,298.37)(14.000,-22.369)2    ' '' ''    ( 207.58,273.80)(0.493,-0.536)23    ' '' ''    ( 206.17,274.90)(13.000,-12.898)2    ' '' ''    ( 220.00,260.93)(0.728,-0.489)15    ' '' ''    ( 220.00,261.17)(11.593,-9.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 233.00,251.94)(1.797,-0.468)5    ' '' ''    ( 233.00,252.17)(10.094,-4.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 246.00,247.95)(2.695,-0.447)3    ' '' ''    ( 246.00,248.17)(9.195,-3.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 272,245.67 )    ' '' ''    ( 272.00,245.17)(6.500,1.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 285,246.67 )    ' '' ''    ( 285.00,246.17)(6.500,1.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 298,248.17 )    ' '' ''    ( 298.00,247.17)(7.396,2.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 311.00,250.61)(2.918,0.447)3    ' '' ''    ( 311.00,249.17)(9.918,3.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 325.00,253.60)(1.797,0.468)5    ' '' ''    ( 325.00,252.17)(10.094,4.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 338.00,257.61)(2.695,0.447)3    ' '' ''    ( 338.00,256.17)(9.195,3.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 351.00,260.60)(1.797,0.468)5    ' '' ''    ( 351.00,259.17)(10.094,4.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 364.00,264.60)(1.797,0.468)5    ' '' ''    ( 364.00,263.17)(10.094,4.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 377.00,268.59)(1.378,0.477)7    ' '' ''    ( 377.00,267.17)(10.634,5.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 390.00,273.60)(1.797,0.468)5    ' '' ''    ( 390.00,272.17)(10.094,4.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 403.00,277.59)(1.378,0.477)7    ' '' ''    ( 403.00,276.17)(10.634,5.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 416.00,282.59)(1.378,0.477)7    ' '' ''    ( 416.00,281.17)(10.634,5.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 429.00,287.59)(1.489,0.477)7    ' '' ''    ( 429.00,286.17)(11.468,5.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 443.00,292.59)(1.378,0.477)7    ' '' ''    ( 443.00,291.17)(10.634,5.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 456.00,297.59)(1.378,0.477)7    ' '' ''    ( 456.00,296.17)(10.634,5.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 469.00,302.59)(1.123,0.482)9    ' '' ''    ( 469.00,301.17)(10.994,6.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 482.00,308.59)(1.378,0.477)7    ' '' ''    ( 482.00,307.17)(10.634,5.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 495.00,313.59)(1.378,0.477)7    ' '' ''    ( 495.00,312.17)(10.634,5.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 508.00,318.59)(1.123,0.482)9    ' '' ''    ( 508.00,317.17)(10.994,6.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 521.00,324.59)(1.378,0.477)7    ' '' ''    ( 521.00,323.17)(10.634,5.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 534.00,329.59)(1.123,0.482)9    ' '' ''    ( 534.00,328.17)(10.994,6.000)2    ' '' ''    ( 547.00,335.59)(1.214,0.482)9    ' '' ''",

    "if we set a cut off @xmath118 , the parameter @xmath88 appeared in the integration measure ( [ measure ] ) must not take a value 0 but 1 because of @xmath119 : @xmath120 thus , our theory is not mere variable transformation of a ordinary quantum field theory . in other words , the method of quantizing fields considered in this paper",

    "the translation generator @xmath121 is ill - defined on that space , instead the operator @xmath122 is well - defined . in the same sense , the operator @xmath123 is ill - defined and the operator @xmath124 is well - defined in our formalism .",
    "in this paper we construct the scaler field theory in arbitrary dimensions with path integral formalism based on generalized canonical commutation relations .",
    "we adopt the guideline that canonical formalism and path integral formalism are equivalent by using bjl prescription and a second quantized hamiltonian is formed by calculating the ` expectation value ' of first quantized hamiltonian with a ` wavefunction ' replaced by the quantized field @xcite .",
    "we first consider the deformation in 1 + 1 dimensional canonical formalism , then we construct path integral formalism by bjl prescription . in the path integral formalism",
