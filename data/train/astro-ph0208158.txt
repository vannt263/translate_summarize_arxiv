    "ngc  1068 is one of the original `` spiral nebulae '' that were noted by seyfert ( 1943 ) to have strong , high - excitation emission lines in their nuclear optical spectra .",
    "its lack of `` broad '' ( fwhm @xmath16 1000 km  s@xmath9 ) emission lines from a `` broad - line region '' ( blr ) , argued to be present in type  1 seyfert nuclei , identify it as a type  2 seyfert galaxy .",
    "however , when broad balmer emission lines were discovered in its _ polarized _ optical nuclear spectrum by antonucci & miller ( 1985 ) , it became clear that this galaxy contained a `` hidden '' broad - line region , seen only in light reflected around an intervening obscuring medium .",
    "this result , combined with results for other seyfert galaxies , gave rise to the so - called unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , which asserts that the difference between type  1 and type  2 agns is due to the relative orientation of an optically thick torus which surrounds the central engine and blr ( cf .",
    "antonucci 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "x - ray observations of agns have , for the most part , supported this unified model . for example , observations of x - ray bright type  2 seyfert galaxies with the heao-1 satellite ( mushotzky 1982 ) showed that their x - ray spectra were well represented by a power - law with photon index @xmath17 1.8 ( characteristic of type  1 seyferts ) , with additional absorption with column densities n@xmath18 10@xmath19 atoms @xmath20 .",
    "the absorption column in type  2 seyfert galaxies , typically @xmath010@xmath21@xmath210@xmath22 @xmath20 , is assumed to be due to the blocking torus ( e.g. , mulchaey , mushotzky & weaver 1992 ) .",
    "higher quality data now show that seyfert x - ray spectra are more complex than a simple absorbed power - law . in many type  2 objects , a ` soft excess ' ( soft x - ray emission in excess of that expected from a simple absorbed power - law ) is common below @xmath02 kev ( e.g. turner & pounds 1989 ) . above @xmath010 kev ,",
    "the power - law slope generally flattens ( e.g. , nandra & pounds 1994 ) due to compton scattering of nuclear light reflected from the accretion disk ( ergo , the `` reflection component '' ) .",
    "soft x - ray absorption lines ( e.g. , due to o , ne , mg , si , fe ) from an ionized medium are also present ( cf . reynolds & fabian 1995 ) . and finally , between 6 and 7 kev , strong fe  k@xmath1 fluorescence lines are present , and are thought to originate from the accretion disk , or , in some cases , from the inner edge of the torus .",
    "the central region of ngc  1068 contains a starburst ( e.g. , wilson et al .",
    "1992 ) , which produces a large fraction of the x - ray emission below @xmath04 kev ( e.g. , levenson et al .",
    "2001 ) . at higher energies",
    ", the agn dominates the spectrum .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the agn is particularly interesting , in that it has an fe k@xmath1 line with a very large equivalent - width ( ew ) , first discovered with ginga by koyama et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , who modelled the spectrum with a relatively flat ( @xmath23 1.5 ) power - law with little or no absorption , plus a single gaussian line centered at 6.55  kev with ew of 1.3  kev .",
    "compare this with typical ews for type  1 seyferts , which are @xmath3500 ev ( e.g. , nandra et al . 1997 ) .",
    "such a large ew was predicted by the x - ray scattering model of krolik & kallman ( 1987 ) , although the measured ew in ngc  1068 is larger than predicted .",
    "it was suggested that the observed ( reflected ) x - ray continuum flux is much smaller than that illuminating the fluorescing material , resulting in a larger ew than for seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "higher - resolution x - ray spectral data obtained with bbxrt showed three separate narrow fe  k@xmath1 components with a net ew of 2.7 kev ( marshall et al . 1993 ) .",
    "marshall et al . suggested that the multiple fe  k features arose from two components of the nuclear gas , a hot and a warm component . a revised model of the x - ray continuum for ngc  1068",
    "was later put forward by smith , done & pounds ( 1993 ) , who found that although a reflection component was not required by the ginga data , if it were included , it would change the inferred intrinsic power - law slope to @xmath23 1.9 , more typical of seyfert  1 x - ray spectra .",
    "more recent asca data have confirmed the three separate line components , this time with a total ew of 3.2 kev ( ueno et al .",
    "1994 ) . using the same asca data ,",
    "iwasawa et al . (",
    "1997 ) proposed the existence of a fourth fe  k component @xmath2 a weak red wing of the 6.4 kev fluorescence line , possibly due to compton scattering in optically thick , cold matter ( matt et al . 1996 ) .",
    "hard ( @xmath1610 kev ) x - ray emission detected by bepposax ( matt et a. 1997 ) is consistent with reflection from a mixture of neutral and ionized gas , with an intrinsic power - law slope of @xmath23 1.7 .    in this paper",
    ", we further investigate the nature of the x - ray emission due to the agn by analyzing the broad - band ( e @xmath24 4@xmath2200 kev ) x - ray spectrum using all of the available data from the asca , rxte and bepposax missions .",
    "we focus here only on the x - ray spectrum above 4  kev to avoid the nuclear starburst .",
    "the hard ( @xmath16 10 kev ) x - ray spectral coverage provided by the rxte and bepposax phoswich detector system ( pds ) data is vital for placing constraints on continuum models . after the continuum is well modelled with the best data available , we can then accurately model the fe  k@xmath1 complex . such is the goal of the current paper . in section 2 , we describe the data used for our analyses and describe details of the data reduction .",
    "section 3 contains the primary observational results from our analyses and section 4 contains a discussion of the implied physical constraints on the geometry of the nucleus of ngc  1068 and the origin of the x - ray emission . throughout this paper",
    ", we assume a distance of 14.67  mpc ( h@xmath25 75 km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 ) to ngc  1068 .",
    "we restrict photon energies to be @xmath26 4 kev , to avoid any starburst emission . a timeline of the relevant spectral observations is shown graphically in figure  [ figallobs ] , showing the following four epochs : ( epoch  0 ) asca1 , ( 1 ) asca2/rxte , ( 2 ) sax1 and ( 3 ) sax2 . in this paper , we concentrate mainly on the data from epochs  1 and 2 , thus our odd numbering scheme .",
    "additional information about the observations are listed in table  1 .",
    "data from the two archival asca observations were retrieved from the us archives at the nasa / gsfc high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) . both the solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis0 and sis1 ) , and the gas imaging spectrometers ( gis2 and gis3 ) were used in our analyses .",
    "the data were screened as follows .",
    "sis data data were obtained in bright mode .",
    "observing times with high background were removed , based on the recommended criteria in the asca data analysis guide .",
    "hot and flickering pixels were discarded , as were data when the satellite passes through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , when its elevation above earth s limb is @xmath27 ( night ) or @xmath28 ( day ) , when the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity is @xmath29  gev  c@xmath9 , and when the time is @xmath30  s after a day / night transition , or @xmath30",
    "s after an saa passage .",
    "background counts were accumulated from source - free regions near the target and then subtracted .",
    "the asca spectra were grouped to have @xmath31 photons in each energy bin .",
    "the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) data were taken simultaneously with the second asca observation ( asca2 ) .",
    "the pca consists of five proportional counter units ( pcus ) , three of which were reliable during the observation .",
    "pca standard mode  2 data were reduced with the rex ( v0.2 ) script from ftools ( v5.0.1 ) , using the default selection criteria , as follows .",
    "data were extracted only from layer  1 , and only from pcus 0 , 1 and 2 ; for earth elevation angle @xmath2610@xmath32 , pointing offset @xmath330.02@xmath32 , `` electron contamination '' @xmath330.1 , and times @xmath2630 min after the peak of the last saa passage .",
    "the background was estimated using pcabackest ( v2.1e ) , using the l7 - 240 background model , recommended for faint sources by the nasa / gsfc rxte guest observing facility .",
    "the l7 - 240 model is composed of two components : ` l7 ' and ` 240 . '",
    "the ` l7 ' component estimates the internal detector background derived from a combination of 7 rates in pairs of adjacent signal anodes , read directly from the standard  2 data files .",
    "the ` 240 ' component estimates the effect of particles present in the detectors after an saa passage , assuming a decaying exponential with half - life 240  s. the response matrix was generated using the ftools task pcarmf ( v3.7 ) .",
    "both sets of bepposax data were retrieved from the archives at the bepposax science data center ( sdc ) in rome . only data from the medium - energy concentrator spectrometers ( mecs ) and the pds instruments were used .",
    "raw data were processed by the sdc s supervised standard science analysis ( rev . 0 for the sax1 data and rev .",
    "1.1 for the sax2 data ) .",
    "we used bepposax sdc calibration and background data released in november 1998 .",
    "the first observation ( sax1 ) occurred before mecs instrument no .",
    "1 failed ( i.e. , before may 7 , 1997 ) , so events from all three mecs were available .",
    "sax1 mecs spectra were extracted using circular regions of radius 4  and then combined into one spectrum by routine pipeline processing by the bepposax sdc . the combined spectrum",
    "was then grouped so that it had a minimum of 20 counts per spectral bin .",
    "background data were taken from a 4  source region from sdc background events files .",
    "the spectral data from the pds instrument were not modified from their original condition after being processed by the sdc .",
    "the pds data were grouped according to the default grouping file ( provided by the sdc ) .",
    "pds data processed by the pipeline processing of the bepposax sdc are already background - subtracted .",
    "only two mecs instruments were available during the second sax observation ( sax2 ) , since mecs no .",
    "1 had failed by that time .",
    "the sax2 mecs and pds data were processed in a similar manner to the sax1 data , although source and background counts were extracted using circular regions of 3 .",
    "our first goal is to constrain x - ray continuum models of the agn , so we concentrate on the spectral data with the highest signal - to - noise ratio and the best broad - band ( from @xmath04 to greater than 10 kev ) coverage .",
    "compton reflection is expected to contribute significantly to the continuum shape at energies @xmath16 10 kev , so the asca spectra ( @xmath310 kev ) alone do not constrain this component well .",
    "however , asca data are needed to accurately model the fe  k@xmath1 complex .",
    "the rxte data spectral response ( up to @xmath0 40  kev ) is ideally suited to model the compton reflection component , while the bepposax mecs instrument offers good coverage of the fe  k region and the @xmath04@xmath210 kev continuum .",
    "the bepposax pds data have low resolving power , but are useful in constraining the high - energy x - ray continuum ( up to @xmath0100 kev ) .",
    "since the sax1 data have much longer exposure times than the sax2 data ( table  [ tab1 ] ) , and were taken nearer to the time of the epoch  1 data , we use them for modelling the broad - band x - ray spectrum .",
    "we therefore initially used the simultaneous asca2 and rxte data ( epoch  1 ) , and the sax1 ( epoch  2 ) data , taken four months later .",
    "xspec v11.1.0 is used for all spectral fits .",
    "all errors are quoted at the 90% uncertainty level for one interesting parameter ( @xmath34 2.7 ) .",
    "because the spectrum of ngc  1068 is complex , assumptions about the spectral structure of the fe  k region may affect our continuum model . in this section , we investigate potential continuum components using four different simple continuum models , together with two fe  k line emission models .",
    "for the line models , we use four gaussian components , first an empirical model which provides a good fit , and , second , a `` narrow - line '' model with fixed central energies .",
    "the continuum models are : ( 1 ) an absorbed power - law , ( 2 ) reflection from optically thin ionized gas ( power - law plus an fe  k edge ) , ( 3 ) reflection from optically thick neutral gas ( xspec constant - density model pexrav ; magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , and ( 4 ) reflection from optically thick ionized gas ( pexriv ) .",
    "galactic absorption was included with n@xmath35 fixed at 3.53 @xmath36 10@xmath37 @xmath20 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "relative normalization constants for each detector were allowed to vary , but were constrained to be within ranges determined from cross - calibration studies ( see section 3.1.3 ) .      in order to test for variability in the hard continuum between epochs",
    ", we fit the rxte , sax1 pds , and sax2 pds spectra individually with an absorbed power law model . the 12@xmath240 kev flux and the spectral indices are consistent with no variation between each of the three observations .",
    "therefore , fitting the epoch  2 sax1 pds data together with the epoch  1 asca and rxte data is justified .      for the purposes of finding the best continuum model , we first take an empirical approach to modelling the fe  k@xmath1 line complex , using only the epoch  1 data ( asca2 and rxte ) . following iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we model the fe  k line complex with four gaussian components , but allow the line energies and line widths to vary . after trying the continuum models",
    ", we found that the best fit model was for an optically thick ionized reflection continuum model ( @xmath7 2000 erg  cm  s@xmath9 ) with gaussian central energies ( and line widths @xmath38 ) at 6.21 ( 0.01 ) , 6.38 ( 0.05 ) , 6.59 ( 0.007 ) , and 6.84 ( 0.09 ) kev .",
    "we attach no physical significance to these energies and line widths , and note only that they fit the spectral data well .",
    "we then fixed the central energies , line widths , and line fluxes to the values from this fit and proceeded to fit the epoch  1 and 2 data together .",
    "the ionized reflection models are again significantly preferred over the other two models ( @xmath39/dof @xmath40 486/419 and 498/419 , for the optically thick and optically `` thin '' models , compared to 532/420 and 536/420 , for the absorbed power - law and neutral reflection models , respectively ) .",
    "such a large difference in @xmath39 suggests that the dominant component of the continuum emission is indeed reflection from an ionized plasma .",
    "both the optically thick and optically thin ionized reflection models ( the best fit models ) require an edge from ionized fe at e @xmath24 8.6 kev ( fe xxiii @xmath2 xxv ) .",
    "the best - fit fe  k edge depth @xmath41 is @xmath00.5 for the `` optically thin '' model , which is not really in the optically thin or thick range . since there is no available model for reflection from ionized gas with @xmath42 0.5",
    "( see footnote for solar [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , leahy & creighton 1993 ) , @xmath43 for @xmath44 1 . ] ) , in the remainder of the paper , we show results from both our pexriv ( optically thick ) and power - law - plus - edge ( optically thin ) models .",
    "the reduced @xmath39 values for the ionized reflection models ( @xmath45 1.2 ) further suggest that some features are still not well modelled .",
    "indeed , the epoch  2 mecs spectrum shows excess emission centered near 6.7 kev . in figure",
    "[ figratio ] , we show the ratio of the data to the absorbed power - law model for energies near the fe  k complex .",
    "while the epoch  1 asca2 detectors ( top four panels ) show no consistent residual line emission , residuals are clearly evident at @xmath06.7 kev in the epoch  2 mecs spectrum ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the result is not an artifact of the continuum model , since ratio plots using the other continuum models show the same result .",
    "this demonstrates variability in the fe  k@xmath1 line complex between epochs 1 and 2 ( discussed further in section 3.2 ) .",
    "for this reason , hereafter we omit the sax1 mecs spectrum in the fit , when fitting for the purpose of determining the broad - band continuum shape .",
    "now , using only the sax1 pds data with the asca2 and rxte data ( and cross - calibration constant ranges described in section 3.1.3 ) , the fits are much better ( see table 2 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath46 1.0 for the optically thick ionized reflection model , compared to @xmath46 1.3 , when the sax1 mecs is included .",
    "the absorbed power - law model and neutral reflection models are still not acceptable fits ( @xmath39/dof = 376/322 and 401/322 , respectively ) .",
    "the `` optically - thin '' ionized reflection model with an edge at @xmath08.6 kev is also a good fit , with @xmath45 1.07 .",
    "these results suggest that much of the nuclear x - ray emission is reflected into our line of sight by highly ionized gas with @xmath47  erg  cm  s@xmath48 3 .",
    "we can not , however , discriminate between an optically thick or thin ionized reflector .",
    "the compton reflection component provided by the optically thick model pexriv does give a better fit than the optically - thin reflection model ( @xmath34 31 ) .",
    "this suggests that at least one optically thick reflector ( ionized or neutral ; see also matt et al .",
    "1997 ) is present .",
    "relative flux normalization constants between the various asca , xte and sax instruments have been estimated by yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and fiore et al .",
    "the results are that all asca instruments and the sax mecs give the same flux values within 3% .",
    "the xte pcas give a 20% higher flux value , assuming that the are no effects due to their different aperture sizes .",
    "compared with mecs , the sax pds gives a 15% low flux value , again assuming no aperture effects .    for the rest of the fits in this paper ( the `` narrow - line '' fits ) , we restricted the calibration constants of the instruments to be within our best - estimated ranges",
    "this is necessary to insure that any variability we find is not due to calibration differences .",
    "we first fixed the calibration of the asca gis2 instrument to 1.0 .",
    "all relative calibration constants of the other instruments are quoted with respect to gis2 .",
    "we allowed the calibration constants for all other asca instruments and the mecs to vary within a 6% uncertainty range ( 0.94@xmath21.06 ) .",
    "the larger aperture of the xte pca allows more flux from the rest of the ngc  1068 galaxy , so we determined the `` best '' pca normalization constant from the empirical four - gaussian fit to only the epoch  1 data , using our best - fit continuum model , the optically - thick ionized reflection model .",
    "the resulting range was 1.34@xmath496% , which is consistent with yaqoob et al.s value , given the larger aperture of the pca .",
    "the `` best '' pds normalization constant was determined from fitting the four - gaussian empirical models to both the epoch 1 and 2 data .",
    "all continuum models gave the same result , 0.81 , thus we used a range of 0.81@xmath496% for the pds .",
    "this range is also consistent with the estimated value from the sax calibration team .",
    "we next model the fe  k@xmath1 line complex with three narrow ( @xmath50 0 ) gaussian lines and fix the central energies of the lines to those of the expected strong atomic transitions or other observed features : 6.40 kev ( ` neutral ' fe k@xmath51 and k@xmath52 transitions ) , 6.70 kev ( he - like fe xxv ) , and 6.97 kev ( h - like fe xxvi ) . adding a line at 6.6 kev ( to represent the blend of fe  xxv and xxiv lines expected in a hot plasma , e.g. , beiersdorfer et al .",
    "1993 ; feldman , doschek & kreplin 1980 ) does not improve the fit and so we omit that feature .",
    "however , the ` compton shoulder ' feature at @xmath24 6.2 kev ( iwasawa et al .",
    "1997 ) is significant , so we include an additional line at 6.21 kev and fix its width @xmath38 to 150 ev .",
    "line fluxes were allowed to vary .",
    "this narrow - line model is consistent with the chandra hetg spectra of the ngc  1068 nucleus published by ogle et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who find that the fe line complex is fit very well with unresolved fe lines at these energies , with no evidence for a broad fe line component ( p. ogle , priv .",
    "comm . ) .    using this narrow - line model , the ionized reflection continuum models are again clearly preferred over both the absorbed power - law and neutral reflection models , as they were for the empirical fe - line model .",
    "the line fluxes are not significantly different for the four models ( see table 3 ) , indicating that the line parameters are not strongly correlated with the choice of continuum model .    in summary , both the empirical and narrow - line methods of modelling the fe  k features imply that the continuum flux from ngc  1068 includes a reflected component from highly ionized gas . for both optically thick and optically `` thin '' ionized reflection models , the fe",
    "absorption edge energy is @xmath08.6 kev , implying that the ionization parameter @xmath53 of the warm reflector has a value @xmath54 3 .",
    "implications of these results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ feemp ] , there is excess line emission in the mecs centered @xmath0 6.7 kev ( figure  [ figratio ] ) , implying an increase in the epoch-2 6.7 kev line flux , compared to epoch  1 . here , we investigate this variability further by fitting the narrow - line models discussed above ( section  [ fenarrow ] ) to all of the epoch  1 and epoch  2 data simultaneously .",
    "we perform fits using all four continuum models , for completeness .",
    "first , we froze the the continuum model parameters for both epoch  1 and 2 data to those listed in table  [ tab2 ] ( the ` epoch  1 ' values ) , while the four epoch  2 fe  k line fluxes were allowed to vary .",
    "initially , we did not allow the continuum ( i.e. power - law normalization ) to vary between epochs . however , simply allowing the power - law normalization to vary improved the fit enormously ( @xmath34 70@xmath280 ) and consistently showed a decrease in the continuum flux by 20% ( uncertainty of 5@xmath210% ) , independent of the choice of continuum model .",
    "we discuss the continuum variability further in sections 3.3 and 4 .",
    "the resulting line fluxes for the variable - norm case for both epochs are listed in table  [ tab3 ] and are shown graphically in figure  [ figlinvar ] .",
    "although we do not favor the constant - norm case , we also list fluxes for it in table 3 .",
    "although the ionized reflection continuum models ( 2 and 4 ) are clearly preferred over the other two continuum models , as a precaution , we also performed the same test for the absorbed power - law and neutral reflection continuum models .",
    "the 6.7 kev line flux is consistently a factor of @xmath01.6 higher in epoch  2 , while the 6.4 kev line flux is statistically consistent with no variation .",
    "the larger epoch  2 value for the 6.7 kev line flux is consistent with measurements from recent chandra hetg data ( p. ogle , priv .",
    "comm . ) .    in order",
    "to ensure that the increase in the 6.7 kev line flux was not due to a change in the continuum shape , we also allowed various continuum model parameters to vary between epochs ( see table 3 and figure 4 ) .",
    "the main result is that the flux in the 6.7 kev component shows an increase regardless of the continuum shape .",
    "we should note that for several cases using the the neutral reflection model , while the 6.7 kev line flux does show an increase , it is not at the 90% confidence level .",
    "however , we also note that the neutral reflection model is a very poor fit to the broad - band spectrum .",
    "the ratio in the line flux ( epoch  2/epoch  1 ) ranges from 1.53 to 1.75 for the best - fit ionized reflection models ( models 2 and 4 ) .",
    "thus , we can say with confidence that the structure of the fe  k line complex has varied in the four months between the two epochs , and , in particular the 6.7 kev line flux has increased by a factor of 1.53@xmath21.75 . for the case when the continuum spectral shape did not change , but the continuum flux did , the increase factor in the 6.7 kev line flux is 1.6@xmath21.7 , for the best - fit ionized reflection models .",
    "we have also attempted to model the fe  k variability in other ways .",
    "if the central line energy of the `` 6.7  kev '' line is allowed to vary from 6.70 kev while fitting , it does not deviate from 6.70 kev .",
    "if we further allow the line width @xmath38 to vary , it increases to 0.12 kev . even in this case , the 6.7  kev line flux variability is still comparable to that for the narrow - line fe model , while the other line fluxes are consistent with those in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "thus , even if the line width has increased , the line flux has increased as well .",
    "we also fit the fe  k complex with 6.4 and 6.7 kev lines using a relativistic disk model ( xspec model diskline ) to see if the variability could be modelled in terms of physical variations in the accretion disk ( e.g. , the inner radius of the accretion disk ) .",
    "we first tried replacing only the 6.7  kev gaussian line with a disk line , and then tried replacing both the 6.4 kev line and the 6.7 kev line with a disk line .",
    "however , for both face - on ( i @xmath0 30@xmath55 ) and edge - on ( i @xmath0 70@xmath55 ) disks , the disk model is a poor fit , regardless of the central energy .",
    "we obtain @xmath56 500 for a combined fit with epoch  1 and 2 data with an ionized reflection continuum model , compared with @xmath57 400@xmath2420 for pure gaussian line fits in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "the fit is poor regardless of what central energy is used for the line and whether the continuum is allowed to vary between epochs .",
    "therefore , we conclude that either a relativistic disk line of this variety is not present , or , if it is present , the fe  k complex has too many components to be able to model it directly with current data .",
    "the recent chandra hetg grating spectrum of the ngc  1068 nucleus also shows no evidence for a broad fe line component ( ogle et al .",
    "2001 ) , which supports our conclusion that there is no dominant broad fe line component present in our data .",
    "we also checked for variability of the continuum flux between all four epochs of data . in figure",
    "[ figcontvar ] , we show the 4@xmath210 kev flux ( including the fe  k emission ; open rectangles ) and the 4@xmath25 kev flux ( solid rectangles ) from the asca gis2 or sax mecs instruments . between the two epochs for which the 6.7  kev component varied ( epochs  1 and 2 ) , the continuum flux decreased by 18% , consistent with the 20% value obtained in section 3.2 .",
    "the 20% error bars in the plot correspond with typical 90% confidence ranges of the power - law norm ( `` n '' in table 3 ) when several interesting parameters were allowed to vary .",
    "we conclude that the continuum flux did not vary more than 20% over the entire timespan ( from 1993.5 to 1998 ) , assuming the continuum shape is allowed to vary .",
    "if the continuum shape did not vary between epochs 1 and 2 , the flux decreased by @xmath2420% , with a subsequent rise in flux between epochs 2 and 3 .",

    "it is worth noting that since the morphology of the radio clumps of s1 are not co - linear ( as one would expect from an unwarped , edge - on disk / torus ) , it is quite possible that one of the clumps is in the gallimore et al .",
    "radio image is the primary warm x - ray reflector .",
    "how does our proposed warm reflector region fit in with the agn paradigm ?",
    "krolik & kriss ( 1995 ) suggest that the `` warm absorbers '' seen in type  1 agn may be associated with the warm reflection region .",
    "typical ionization parameters associated with the warm absorbers are @xmath58 10@xmath2100 erg  cm  s@xmath9 ( e.g. , reynolds 1997 , kaspi et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is much lower than the values we find ( @xmath58 10@xmath59 ) . in principle , there could be clouds with different densities and mean ionization parameters in each of these regions , which could be responsible for the warm absorbers see in agn x - ray spectra .",
    "one possibility is that the more highly ionized , inner regions of the warm reflector clouds reflect x - rays toward our line of sight , while the more weakly ionized , outer regions of the clouds cause the warm , ionized edges .",
    "we suggest the existence of ionized , warm reflector gas clouds distributed within a radius of @xmath00.2 pc .",
    "the highly ionized gas in this region produces an fe  k edge near 8.6 kev in the reflected nuclear spectrum , as well as both the observed 6.7  kev and 6.97  kev emission lines .",
    "cold reflection , required to model the observed compton reflection hump , originates from optically thick `` cold '' gas in the inner nlr and/or from the inner surface of the torus .",
    "our data and proposed models are most consistent with an intrinsically x - ray weak agn with l@xmath14 10@xmath15 erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "we thank tahir yaqoob , jack gallimore , steve kraemer , mike crenshaw and the anonymous referees for helpful discussions , and tim kallman for help with xstar .",
    "we also thank andy ptak for use of his tcl scripts for computing uncertainty ranges of xspec model parameters .",
