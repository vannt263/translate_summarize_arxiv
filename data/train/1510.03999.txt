    "the inverse scattering problems are well known to be severely ill - posed .",
    "it has widespread applications in , e.g. , oil / crack detection , target identification , geophysical prospection , non - destructive testing , medical imaging , physiological measurement @xcite . due to their applications ,",
    "inverse scattering problems have attracted much attention , and many numerical algorithms have been developed over the recent decades for phased reconstruction problems , e.g. , time - reversal multiple signal classification methods @xcite , the contrast source inversion methods @xcite , the continuation method @xcite , the subspace - based optimization method @xcite , the linear sampling or probing methods @xcite , the parallel radial bisection method @xcite , direct sampling methods @xcite , multi - level sampling methods @xcite , etc .",
    "however , in many areas of applied sciences it is very difficult and expensive to obtain the phased data of the scattered field , while the phaseless data is much easier to acquire .",
    "in addition , the phase of the field is more easily polluted by the noise than the amplitude in many practical situations .",
    "for instance , the measurement of the phase is extremely difficult when the working frequency is beyond tens of gigahertz , and one can not expect a good accuracy of the phase measurement @xcite .",
    "this motivates the phaseless reconstructions , and attracts huge attention from both the physics and mathematics communities .",
    "nonetheless , the phaseless reconstruction is yet much more severely ill - posed than the phased reconstruction , in particular , it appears to be impossible to recover the location of an obstacle only from the modulus of the far - field pattern owing to the fact that it is invariant under translations @xcite . in spite of this drastic difficulty ,",
    "several approaches have been proposed in literature for the phaseless medium reconstruction in optics , acoustic and electromagnetics , e.g. , the phaseless data multiplicative regularized contrast sources inversion method @xcite , and several other methods @xcite . also , the phaseless acoustic ( sound - soft ) obstacle reconstruction was studied in @xcite , where the reconstruction is split into two parts : the shape reconstruction from the phaseless data and the location of the obstacle from a few phased measurements .",
    "theoretically , the uniqueness of a phaseless scattering reconstruction was established in @xcite , while the phaseless measurements were connected to the radon transform of the potential under the born approximation @xcite , and a new numerical method was proposed in @xcite for the phaseless problem using this connection to radon transform .",
    "there are also other works which address both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of problems related to phaseless reconstruction of a function or vector , where the phase of a function or vector is recovered from the modulus of its evaluation of a special family of functionals @xcite , e.g. , the coefficients of a cauchy wavelet transform .    in this work",
    ", we shall study both the phased and phaseless shape reconstructions from the far - field data of an acoustic medium scattering problem , so the governing equation of our interest is the following helmholtz system : u+k^2(1+q(x))u = 0 ^2 [ scattering1 ] where @xmath0 is the total field , @xmath1 is the contrast of the medium and @xmath2 is the wave number .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 is an inclusion contained inside a homogeneous background medium , and it is an open bounded connected domain with a @xmath4-boundary for @xmath5 .",
    "we consider the contrast @xmath6 of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the characteristic function of @xmath3 and @xmath9 is a constant .",
    "the helmholtz system ( [ scattering1 ] ) is often complemented by the physical outgoing sommerfeld radiation condition : | u^s- i k u^s |= o(|x|^-)|x| , [ sommerfield ] where @xmath10 is the scattered field and @xmath11 is the incident wave .",
    "now we can see that the solution @xmath0 to the system - represents the total field due to the scattering from the inclusion @xmath3 corresponding to the incident @xmath11 .",
    "then the phased reconstruction is to recover the shape of @xmath3 from the phased measurements of either the scattered field or the far - field , while the phaseless reconstruction is to recover the shape of @xmath3 from only the magnitude of the scattered field or the far - field .",
    "we shall analyse the sensitivity , resolution and stability of both phased and phaseless reconstructions in the linearized cases under certain measurement strategies , and compare the major differences between these two reconstructions . with the help of these analyses , we will propose an efficient measurement method which leads to a well - posed inversion process of the phaseless reconstruction .",
    "as demonstrated by our early works @xcite , the scattering coefficients provide a powerful and efficient tool for shape classification of a target domain , and this concept will also persist in this work to help us establish stable reconstruction algorithms and their analysis .",
    "we start by recalling the phased reconstruction in the linearized case so as to provide important insight into the highly nonlinear phaseless reconstruction problems . within this framework",
    ", we shall provide a resolution analysis on numerical reconstruction with phased data in terms of snr , then propose algorithms for shape reconstructions with the phased measurement .",
    "another major focus of this work is the stability of the phaseless reconstruction , for which we will provide an efficient algorithm , and estimate the condition number of the phaseless inversion process .",
    "we are able to establish a sharp upper bound for the infimum of the condition numbers of the inversion process over all phaseless measurement strategies for a given target resolution , hence propose an optimal modulus measurement method .",
    "a similar analysis is carried out for the phased reconstruction to allow a clear comparison between the phased and phaseless reconstructions . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our stability estimates in terms of condition numbers are completely new to inverse medium scattering problems and appear to be a very important and effective novel tool to help us better understand the degree of ill - posedness and stability of both the phased and phaseless reconstructions .",
    "the remaining part of the work is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we review the concept of scattering coefficients and obtain several important results , which will be of crucial importance to connect the scattering coefficients to both the phased and phaseless reconstructions , and help us develop efficient algorithms and their analysis",
    ". then we move on to the sensitivity analysis of the phased measurement data in section [ sec3 ] , which will also give a link - up between the phaseless data and information about the shape of the domain .",
    "an important comparison is provided in section [ sec3 ] for the similarities and differences between the phased and phaseless reconstructions . a phased reconstruction algorithm in the linearized case",
    "is then proposed in section [ sec4 ] , also with a clear resolution analysis of the algorithm .",
    "this resolution analysis is very helpful for us to understand the corresponding resolution constraint in the phaseless reconstruction .",
    "next , we introduce our phaseless recovery problem in section [ sec5 ] , and provide a phaseless shape reconstruction algorithm in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "a stability analysis is performed for our new phaseless reconstruction algorithm in section [ sec_sta ] , optimal strategies for minimizing the condition number of the inversion process and analysis of the differences between the ill - posed natures of the phased and phaseless reconstruction are also given .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section [ numerical ] to confirm the theoretical estimates of the condition number of our inversion process , and illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our newly - proposed phaseless recovery algorithm .",
    "we emphasize that , although our analyses are performed only for two dimensions , similar results and analysis can be extended to higher dimensions as well .",
    "in this section , we recall the definition of the scattering coefficient @xcite and provide some useful results about sensitivity analysis for our subsequent shape reconstruction . to do so , we first introduce some useful notation @xcite .",
