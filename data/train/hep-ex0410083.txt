    "long baseline neutrino beams are the future facilities for neutrino oscillations . only in a well controlled , fully optimized environment",
    "it will be possible to perform precision measurements of @xmath5and @xmath6and to search for the still unknown parameters @xmath3 , @xmath1 , @xmath7 .",
    "these latter parameters can be explored by detecting sub leading @xmath8   transitions , characterized by their smallness given the present experimental bound , from the chooz experiment @xcite .    the present generation of lbl neutrino experiments : k2k , minos , opera and icarus has been designed to confirm the superkamiokande result on atmospheric neutrinos through   disappearance or @xmath9transitions , with limited sensitivity to @xmath3 .",
    "second generation long baseline experiments , like the already approved t2k @xcite , and no@xmath10a @xcite , will extend the sensitivity on @xmath11 by more than one order of magnitude with respect to the present chooz limit .",
    "however they will have very limited sensitivity to the cp phase @xmath12 even if complemented by high sensitivity reactor experiments @xcite .",
    "a third generation of lbl neutrino experiments will be required to start a sensitive search of leptonic cp violation ( lcpv ) .",
    "these future experiments will push conventional neutrino beams to their ultimate performances ( neutrino superbeams ) , or will require new concepts in the production of neutrino beams .",
    "conventional neutrino beams are generated by secondary particle decays , mainly pions and kaons , producing a multiflavour neutrino beam ( , , , besides the main neutrino component , ) .",
    "beam composition and fluxes are difficult to precisely predict because of the lack of knowledge of secondary particle production cross sections ( hadroproduction ) .",
    "these limitations are overcome if the neutrino parents can be selected , collimated and accelerated to a given energy .",
    "the neutrino beams from their decays would then be pure and perfectly predictable .",
    "this can be tempted within the muon or a beta decaying ion lifetimes .",
    "the first approach brings to the neutrino factories @xcite , the second to the beta beams .",
    "beta beams have been introduced by p. zucchelli in 2001 @xcite .",
    "the idea is to generate pure , well collimated and intense   ( ) beams by producing , collecting , accelerating radioactive ions and storing them in a decay ring .",
    "the ideal candidates are chosen with a lifetime around 1 s among the ions that can be artificially copiously produced .",
    "the best candidates so far are @xmath13 and @xmath14 for  and   respectively .",
    "a baseline study for such a betabeam complex has been produced at cern @xcite .    in this",
    "scenario beta beam neutrino energies are below 1 gev and the ideal detector is a water erenkov detector with a mass of the order of 1 megaton , necessary to reach the needed sensitivity .",
    "such a detector would have excellent physics capabilities in its own , as fully described in reference @xcite , like ultimate sensitivities for proton decay , supernovae neutrinos , atmospheric neutrinos etc . a candidate site for this detector exists , located under the frejus , at an appropriate baseline from cern : 130 km .",
    "liquid argon could be an excellent alternative to water , provided that the icarus technology could be scaled to the 100 kton scale @xcite .",
    "the beta - beam complex is described in @xcite and shown schematically in figure  [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "protons are delivered by a high power linac .",
    "beta beam targets need 100 @xmath15a proton beam , at energies between 1 and 2 gev .    in case",
    "the super proton linac ( spl ) @xcite would be used , beta beams could be fired to the same detector together with a neutrino superbeam @xcite .",
    "spl is designed to deliver 2ma of 2.2 gev ( kinetic energy ) protons , in such a configuration beta beams would use 10% of the total proton intensity , leaving room to a very intense conventional neutrino beam .",
    "the targets are similar to the ones envisioned by eurisol  @xcite : the @xmath16he target consists either of a water cooled tungsten core or of a liquid lead core which works as a proton to neutron converter surrounded by beryllium oxide @xcite , aiming for 10@xmath17 fissions per second .",
    "@xmath18ne can be produced by spallation reactions , in this case protons will directly hit a magnesium oxide target .",
    "the collection and ionization of the ions is performed using the ecr technique @xcite .",
    "ions are firstly accelerated to mev / u by a linac and to 300 mev / u , in a single batch of 150 ns , by a rapid cycling synchrotron .",
    "16 bunches ( consisting of 2.5 10@xmath19 ions each in the case of @xmath20 ) are then accumulated into the ps , and reduced to 8 bunches during their acceleration to intermediate energies .",
    "the sps will finally accelerate the 8 bunches to the desired energy using a new 40 mhz rf system and the existing 200 mhz rf system , before ejecting them in batches of four 10 ns bunches into the decay ring .",
    "the sps could accelerate @xmath20ions at a maximum @xmath21 value of @xmath22 .",
    "the decay ring has a total length of 6880 m and straight sections of 2500 m each ( 36% useful length for ion decays ) .",
    "these dimensions are fixed by the need to bend @xmath20ions up to @xmath23 using 5 t superconducting magnets . due to the relativistic time dilatation ,",
    "the ion lifetimes reach several minutes , so that stacking the ions in the decay ring is mandatory to get enough decays and hence high neutrino fluxes .",
    "the challenge is then to inject ions in the decay ring and merge them with existing high density bunches . as conventional techniques with fast elements",
    "are excluded , a new scheme ( asymmetric merging ) was specifically conceived @xcite .",
    "@xmath24and @xmath20ions can be stored together in the decay ring ( of course , in different bunches ) . due to their different magnetic rigidities",
    ", these ions would have relativistic @xmath21 factors in the 5 to 3 ratio , which is quite acceptable for the physics program .",
    "this will impose constraints on the lattice design for the decay ring , but no impossibility has been identified .",
    "an ecr source coupled to an eurisol target would produce @xmath25 @xmath16he ions per second .",
    "taking into account all decay losses along the accelerator complex , and estimating an overall transfer efficiency of 50% , one estimates that @xmath26 ions would permanently reside in the final decay ring .",
    "that would give an antineutrino flux aimed at the frjus underground laboratory of @xmath27 per standard year ( 10@xmath28 s ) .",
    "for @xmath18ne , the yield is expected to be @xmath29 ions in a 2 s exposing time .",
    "due to this smaller yield , which could be certainly improved with some r&d , it was then proposed to use 3 eurisol targets in sequence connected to the same ecr source . again taking into account decay losses plus a 50% efficiency",
    ", this means that @xmath30 such ions would reside in the decay ring , giving rise to a neutrino flux of @xmath31 per standard year .    in the following",
    "it was supposed that the neutrino flux from @xmath24 could be increased by 50% over the present conservative estimate , having room for improvements both in the cycle duration of ps and sps and in the @xmath24production at the targets .",
    "a 40 % improvement was put on the @xmath20generated antineutrino fluxes .",
    "the reference fluxes are then @xmath32 @xmath20   useful decays / year and @xmath33 @xmath24   decays / year .",
    "the main losses are due to decays of he ions , and reach 1.2 w / m in the ps and 9 w / m in the decay ring .",
    "this seems manageable , although the use of superconducting bending magnets in the decay ring requires further studies .",
    "activation issues have been recently addressed @xcite , and show that the dose rate on magnets in the arcs is limited to 2.5 msv / h at contact after 30 days operation and 1 day cooling .",
    "furthermore , the induced radioactivity on ground water will have no impact on public safety .",
    "beta beam sensitivity have been computed assuming a water erenkov detector of 440 kt fiducial mass installed in the underground frjus laboratory , with a 130 km baseline .",
    "most of the results of this section are taken from reference @xcite .",
    "the neutrino beam energy is defined by the @xmath21 of the parent ions in the decay ring .",
    "the energy optimization is a compromise between the advantages of the higher @xmath21 , as a better focusing , higher cross sections and higher signal efficiency and the advantages of the lower @xmath21 values as the reduced background rates and the better match with the probability functions @xcite .",
    "given the decay ring constraint ( see section 2.1 ) : @xmath34 the optimal @xmath21 values result to be @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] shows the betabeam neutrino fluxes computed at a 130 km baseline , together with the spl super beam ( spl - sb ) fluxes .",
    "the mean neutrino energies of the ,   beams are 0.24 gev and 0.36 gev respectively .",
    "they are well matched with the cern - frejus 130 km baseline .",
    "on the other hand energy resolution is very poor at these energies , given the influence of fermi motion and other nuclear effects .",
    "sensitivities are computed for a counting experiment with no energy cuts .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "systematic errors could spoil the sensitivity of any experiment looking for leptonic cp violations . to this purpose a beam without any contamination where the neutrino fluxes are known with great precision , like the beta beam , is the ideal facility .",
    "a major concern is the knowledge of neutrino cross - sections in an energy range where experimental data are poor and the cross sections are roughly proportional to @xmath37 . on",
    "the other hand beta beams are the ideal place where to measure neutrino cross sections .",
    "being the neutrino fluxes precisely known , a close detector of @xmath38kton ( fiducial ) placed at a distance of about 1  km from the decay ring could directly measure the relevant neutrino cross sections .",
    "furthermore the @xmath21 factor of the accelerated ions can be varied .",
    "in particular an energy scan can be initiated below the background production threshold , allowing a precise measurement of the cross sections for resonant processes .",
    "it is estimated that a residual systematic error of 2% will be the final precision with which both the signal and the backgrounds can be evaluated .",
    "the @xmath3and @xmath12 sensitivities are computed taking into account a 10% error on the solar @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and a 5% and 1% error on @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , as expected from the t2k neutrino experiment  @xcite . only the diagonal contributions of these errors",
    "are considered .",
    "@xmath3can be measured either with   and   disappearance and with ,   appearence .",
    "the disappearance channels offer a cleaner extraction of @xmath3   from the experimental result , but are limited by systematic errors .",
    "the comparison of the   and   disappearance measurements could also set limits to cpt violation effects .",
    "@xmath3and @xmath12 are so tightly coupled in the appearance channels that the sensitivity expressed for @xmath44 is purely indicative . a better understanding of the sensitivity of the betabeam is expressed in the @xmath45 plane , having fixed all the other parameters , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : th13 ] ) .    a search for leptonic cp violation can be performed fitting the number of muon - like events to the @xmath46and to the p(@xmath47 ) probabilities .",
    "the fit can provide the simultaneous determination of @xmath3 and @xmath12 , see figure  [ fig : many_plots ] .",
    "event rates are summarized in table  [ tab : beta : rates ] .",
    "the ( @xmath3,@xmath1 ) parameter space where the experiment could measure a @xmath48 lcpv effect is shown in figure  [ fig : cp : delta ] .",
    "discovery potential curves are drawn for 2% , 5% and 10% systematic errors .",
    "the 5% systematic error curve is roughly equivalent to the 2% curve computed with a detector having half the mass , showing the absolute need to keep systematic errors low in this kind of measurements .",
    "correlations between @xmath3and @xmath12 are fully accounted for , and indeed they are negligible as can be seen in the fits to @xmath3and @xmath12 shown in figure  [ fig : many_plots ] .",
    "these correlations are tiny because at the baseline of 130 km matter effects are negligible and do not compete with genuine lcpv effects .",
    "a full computation of degeneracies , correlations and clones for the beta beam sensitivities can be found in @xcite , assuming that at the time beta beam will start no informations about the values of @xmath7   and @xmath5will be available .",
    "the beta beam can run with the spl as injector , but consumes at most @xmath49 of the spl protons .",
    "the fact that the average neutrino energies of both the superbeam and the beta beam are below 0.5 gev ( cfr .",
    "figure  [ fig : fluxes ] ) , with the beta beam tunable , offers the fascinating possibility of exposing the same detector to @xmath50 beams (   and   @xmath51   and ) having access to cp , t and cpt searches in the same run .",
    "it is evident that the combination of the two beams would not only result result an increase of the experimental statistics , but would also offer clear advantages in the reduction of the systematic errors and the necessary redundancy to firmly establish any lcp within the reach of the experiment .",
    "the cp violation sensitivities of the combined betabeam and spl - sb experiments are shown in figure  [ fig : cp : delta ] .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that allowing for higher values of @xmath21 , that is exploiting a higher energy proton synchrotron than the sps , performances of the beta beam could be significantly enhanced . in the paper three different scenarios",
    "are compared : the baseline scenario described in section 2 ( setup i ) , @xmath52 with a baseline @xmath53 ( setup ii ) , and @xmath54 with @xmath55 ( setup iii ) .",
    "the same fluxes of the baseline scenario have been assumed ( the ion currents entering the decay ring correspond to @xmath56 mw at @xmath52 and to @xmath57mw at @xmath54 ) and it should be noted that the decay ring length , linearly proportional to @xmath58 , would be of 16 ( 70 ) km for @xmath59 if computed with the same parameters of the baseline scenario",
    ".    the main advantages of the most promising setup - ii scenario would be    * the mean neutrino energy would be @xmath60 gev and so water erenkov detectors are still suitable ; * a factor @xmath61 increase in charged current event rate ( 1.5 increase at constant accelerator power ) with respect to the baseline scenario ; * the possibility to exploit energy spectrum ( more powerful fits to @xmath3 , @xmath1 ) ; * the possibility of measuring sign(@xmath62 ) ( baseline @xmath63 km ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in section 3.1 , the background rate induced by charged pion production in nc events is very high at these energies .",
    "however the longer the pion track , the higher the probability it interacts in water missing the signature of the decay electron .",
    "a modest cut in the visible neutrino energy can reduce background fractions below @xmath64 for an integrated efficiency of @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "energy reconstruction is much more demanding at 1.2 gev , in particular the non quasi elastic fraction of cc events becomes important , but the methods introduced in the paper allow for an efficient ( though indirect ) true neutrino energy estimation from the measured charged muon momentum .",
    "the 99% cl discovery potential curves in the three different scenarios , computed including no systematic errors are shown if figure  [ fig : cp_pilar ] .      in @xcite",
    "it has been introduced the case of the highest energy that could be accessible at lhc : @xmath66 .",
    "it was assumed that the same fluxes of the baseline scenario could be used and that the decay ring could be partially accommodated inside the lhc tunnel .",
    "the neutrino fluxes at the cern - gran sasso baseline ( 732 km ) would be so high that just counting the muons produced by neutrino interactions in the rock , with a @xmath67 counter detector , the sensitivity on @xmath11 could be increased by about one order of magnitude ( for @xmath44 ) with respect to the baseline scenario . given the neutrino energy and the baseline , the experiment would be strongly off - peak , and no information about @xmath1   or @xmath7would be available .",
    "as discussed in section 3.2 , beta beams are the ideal place where to measure neutrino cross sections .",
    "this could allow for precision measurements in the range of interest of astrophysics ( supernovae explosions , nucleosynthesis etc . ) : @xmath68 , corresponding to @xmath69 .",
    "this experimental possibility is fully discussed in @xcite .",
    "beta beams are a novel concept which can provide a very clean and powerful facility for the search of leptonic cp violation : a single flavour beam and no competition with the fake cp phenomena induced by matter effects .",
    "the baseline scenario has been designed to be based on available technology with some conservative extrapolations .",
    "its design has a very strong synergy with the eurisol project aiming at producing high intensity radioactive beams for nuclear physics studies with astrophysical applications .",
    "the gigantic far detector needed for these studies has excellent physics capabilities in its own , i.e. to study proton decay and detect supernova explosions . a possible site exists near cern at the right distance .",
    "physics potential in neutrino oscillations would be a @xmath11 sensitivity more than two orders magnitude better than the present experimental limit , having the distinctive feature to look for @xmath3also in   and   disappearance channels , and a 3 @xmath70 discovery potential on leptonic cp violation for cp phase @xmath1 values greater than @xmath2 and for @xmath3greater than @xmath4 .",
    "these performances can be further improved if a neutrino superbeam generated by the spl 4mw , 2.2 gev , proton linac would be fired to the same detector . in this configuration",
    "the two beams could address leptonic cp and t violation , and could also explore cpt violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "several new ideas about the baseline option optimization and extensions to higher and lower energies have been recently published , showing the great and partially still unexplored potential of the beta beams .",
