    "considerable observational progress has been made in tracking the star formation rate ( sfr ) per comoving volume element as a function of redshift ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the form of this `` cosmic star formation history '' is important not only in indicating likely eras of dominant activity but also in securing a self - consistent picture of chemical enrichment for detailed comparison with intergalactic absorption line diagnostics @xcite , as well as with the predictions of popular semi - analytical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "various observational diagnostics have been employed to determine the sfr of a galaxy in a particular redshift survey .",
    "these include ( i ) hydrogen series ( i.e. balmer or lyman ) or other nebular emission lines , generated in regions ionised by the most massive ( @xmath1 ) early - type stars , ( ii ) the ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum , dominated by young ( but less massive , @xmath2 ) stars @xcite , ( iii ) far infrared ( fir ) luminosities arising from thermal emission from dust absorbed uv radiation from the more massive stars @xcite , and ( iv ) 1.4ghz radio emission , thought to originate mainly via synchrotron radiation generated by relativistic electrons accelerated by type ii supernovae ( sne ) from stars of mass @xmath3    each diagnostic has its own merits , disadvantages and uncertainties and none can yet be applied uniformly to samples over the full observed redshift range .",
    "accordingly , it is inevitable that the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) has been pieced together using different diagnostics from independent samples of galaxies . therefore , it is crucial to know how well the various diagnostics agree _ on a galaxy by galaxy basis_. a major source of uncertainty is the likelihood that some diagnostics are affected by the presence of obscuring dust .",
    "radio continuum diagnostics have the distinct advantage of being immune from dust extinction .",
    "non - uniformities in the sfh ( or a time varying sfr ) are also important , and might , if present , introduce additional biases between the different sfr diagnostics .    only limited work has been done inter - comparing different star - formation ( sf ) diagnostics for galaxies , with studies at low and intermediate redshifts showing significant discrepancies . @xcite compared the sfrs from h@xmath0 , fir and @xmath4-band measurements with those from decimetric radio luminosity ( @xmath5 ) for a sample of over 700 local galaxies .",
    "though the various sfr estimates were in broad agreement , numerous systematic differences were found , including a significant scatter in all the relationships compared to the @xmath5/fir relation .",
    "they conclude that the scatter may partly be due to sample selection ( i.e. inhomogeneities in the sample selection or possible agn contamination ) or have a real physical basis ( e.g. differential extinction among individual galaxies or time - dependent initial mass functions ) .",
    "studies comparing uv continuum and h@xmath0 emission fluxes likewise reveal systematic discrepancies and a large scatter @xcite .",
    "although extinction is a likely source of the scatter , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s2000 ) argued that the observed trend on the uv - h@xmath0 plane is consistent with non - uniform sfhs for some fraction of the population .",
    "if starburst activities are a common occurrence for high redshift galaxies as some models suggest @xcite , further corrections may be needed to derive representative sfrs from optical and uv diagnostics based on luminous sources only .",
    "this paper is motivated by the need for more comprehensive and rigorous investigation into the inter - relationships between the various sf diagnostics , including those based on the promising 1.4ghz luminosity . though the radio emission is generally thought to be generated as a by - product of the supernovae of massive stars ( and therefore a measure of sfr ) , the steps relating the supernovae explosion to the arrival of radio emission at the earth  for example the electron acceleration in the supernova remnant and the subsequent cosmic ray propagation , the role of magnetic fields , any possible energy loss mechanisms , or a significant cosmic - ray escape fraction  are not yet well understood .",
    "we are therefore particularly interested in the quantitative empirical precision with which radio luminosities can be used to trace sf .",
    "the major hurdle is the need for a large , well - controlled sample with considerable overlap in the various diagnostics .",
    "for this study , we choose the uv - selected sample discussed by @xcite and s2000 , drawn from the foca balloon - borne imaging data of selected area 57 ( sa57 ) , taken by .",
    "the sa57 survey contains 222 spectroscopically - confirmed star - forming galaxies , forming a statistically - complete sample selected at 2000 .    a plan of the paper follows .",
    "in @xmath62 we review the sa57 dataset and briefly describe the 1.4ghz observations ( a more detailed description will be given by chan et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in @xmath63 we discuss the adopted flux - sfr calibrations , the selection effects present in our sample , and inter - compare the sfrs derived from the different diagnostics . in @xmath64 we discuss the implications and present our conclusions . throughout we assume @xmath7 , @xmath8 , solar metallicity , and , unless otherwise stated , our adopted initial mass function is @xcite - like ( @xmath9 ) with mass limits @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the uv - selected sample is drawn from the foca1500 1.55@xmath12 diameter image of selected area 57 centered at @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( b1950 ) .",
    "the photometric details are presented in @xcite and s2000 .",
    "briefly , the errors in the uv photometry range from 0.2mag at the bright end to 0.5mag at the fainter end .",
    "optical fiber spectroscopy has been secured for an unbiased ( i.e. randomly selected ) subset of 369 uv sources limited at @xmath15 ( equivalent to @xmath16 for a late - type galaxy ) using the wiyn observatory ( @xmath17 ) and the william herschel telescope ( wht , @xmath18 ) .",
    "this spectroscopy provides redshifts for 222 uv - selected galaxies , of which 178 were found to have strong emission line spectra .",
    "however , only the wht spectra have sufficient wavelength coverage to detect h@xmath0 , and only for a subsample of 88 wht - observed galaxies is the flux calibration sufficient for a reliable conversion of h@xmath0 to sfr ( note this does _ not _ include all the galaxies with detected h@xmath0 emission ) .",
    "the errors in the h@xmath0 fluxes are estimated from the s / n of the spectrum in question . a fiber size of 2.7  diameter was used for the flux - calibrated optical spectroscopy ;",
    "no aperture corrections are applied , hence the h@xmath0 flux is underestimated in very nearby objects with a larger apparent size ( see s2000 ) .",
    "the 1.4ghz radio observations were carried out at the nrao vla telescope , and cover the central square degree of the sa57 field .",
    "a @xmath19 detection limit of @xmath20 was achieved at the centre of the field dropping to @xmath21 in the outer regions .",
    "a detailed discussion of the vla radio data and its reduction will be presented in chan et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "briefly , the task is to measure radio flux densities , or to estimate upper flux limits , at the positions of all the foca - uv galaxies .",
    "this problem is not the same as deriving a catalogue from the image , since the search positions , at which the foca galaxies are located , are pre - determined .",
    "the position - dependent noise in the image , arising from the primary beam response and the mosaicing method , complicates this problem .",
    "we begin by constructing an image of the position - dependent noise , using the measured noise near the centers of the pointings in conjunction with the primary beam attenuation and the overlapping of the mosaic .",
    "we then search near each uv position . for radio sources with flux densities greater than @xmath22",
    ", we use the aips  task vsad  to determine the source properties from a one - component gaussian fit in which the amplitude , size and position of the source is allowed to vary .",
    "three of these fits reveal very extended sources , whose properties were recalculated from the individual pixel values . for sources fainter than @xmath22 , a gaussian fit was made with the position fixed at the uv source position using the miriad  task imfit  ( as vsad  does not allow position - fixed fitting ) .",
    "if the amplitude of this fit exceeds the local @xmath23 noise level , it is reported as a detection , while fainter fits are reported as upper limits using the @xmath23 level .",
    "for all reported fits , the @xmath23 error is reported based on the noise image .",
    "a total of 26 out of 191 foca galaxies ( with a secure redshift ) within the central 1.4ghz survey area of sa57 are detected using vsad  at a significance level of @xmath24 .",
    "of these , 22 have single optical counterparts on the palomar sky survey ( poss ) plates ( see s2000 for a discussion of foca / poss identification procedures ) .",
    "a further three foca sources were identified with extended radio emission that provided poor fits to a gaussian profile ; the fluxes for these were consequently calculated by adding together all the pixels inside the extended emission area as described above .",
    "the position fixed fitting identifies a further 25 galaxies , 18 with unambiguous optical counterparts . since in the present paper",
    "we only wish to study field galaxies ( avoiding contamination by known cluster members which are likely to reside in different environments ) , we also exclude 3 galaxies in the redshift range of the nearby coma cluster ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "a summary of the sample numbers is given in table  [ sample_numbers ] .",
    "of the final sample , 25 wht - observed galaxy spectra have detected h@xmath0 of which 17 have an adequate flux calibration to derive sfrs .",
    "all observed radio luminosities have been @xmath26-corrected to luminosities appropriate to a rest - frame frequency of 1.4ghz according to @xmath27 , where the spectral index of -0.8 is typical for the non - thermal synchrotron component of decimetric radiation .",
    "to compare the sf diagnostics based on the radio ( @xmath5 ) , uv ( @xmath28 ) , and h@xmath0 ( @xmath29 ) luminosities , a self - consistent calibration is required .",
    "this is accomplished using the pegase - ii   spectral synthesis code @xcite which generates galaxy spectra as a function of time for arbitrary sfhs , from which the h@xmath0 and uv luminosities can be calculated ( s2000 ) . in order to estimate 1.4ghz luminosities for a given sf scenario ,",
    "we add a simple prescription using the type ii supernovae rate given by pegase - ii , using calibrations from .",
    "we calculate the conversion factors for four of the different metallicities available in pegase - ii ; we report solar metallicity conversions below , and the remainder in table  [ conversion_factors ] . assuming a constant sfh , the three sf diagnostics in this study are calibrated as explained below :    _ h@xmath0 emission : _ the relevant photons originate via re - processed ionizing radiation at wavelengths @xmath30   produced by the most massive ( @xmath31 ) , short - lived ( @xmath32 )",
    ", ob stars .",
    "accordingly , h@xmath0 emission is a virtually instantaneous sf measure  for a burst of star - formation with a constant sfr , the h@xmath0 emission can be considered constant after @xmath33 . however , as it depends so strongly on the most massive stars , it is very sensitive to the form of the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "there is much debate in the literature as to the universality , or otherwise , of the imf ( see * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) ; here we assume the form to be universal , but discuss variations in the upper mass cut - off in section  [ sec : phys - orig - scatt ] .",
    "most calibrations assume case - b recombination ( a comprehensive treatment of its use can be found in * ? ? ?",
    "using pegase - ii  we derive :    @xmath34    as a comparison , derive a conversion value of @xmath35 , very close to the value used here .    _ uv 2000  continuum : _ as stars that contribute to radiation at 2000  span a range of ages ( and hence initial masses ) , including some post - main sequence contribution , any uv - sfr calibration is dependent on the past history of sf .",
    "this introduces a significant uncertainty when interpreting the observations of the star - forming galaxies in this sample . as a guide",
    ", we calculate conversion values based on constant burst of sf of durations 10 , 100 and 1000myr using pegase - ii .",
    "this gives :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is equal to 3.75 , 5.76 and 6.56 for 10 , 100 and 1000myr respectively .",
    "derive a conversion value of @xmath38 , again in good agreement .    _",
    "1.4ghz continuum : _ the integrated radio flux at 1.4ghz is thought to originate via non - thermal synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by supernovae ( spectral index @xmath39 ) and thermal bremsstrahlung from electrons in ionised  regions ( spectral index @xmath40 ) . non - thermal emission dominates ( around 90% ) at the frequency of interest .",
    "we introduce a prescription into pegase - ii  to predict the non - thermal 1.4ghz luminosity , @xmath5 , based on the radio supernova rate ( type ii sne ) in the pegase - ii  code . for a constant sfr burst ,",
    "the sneii rate is effectively constant after @xmath41 . using the relationship between non - thermal radio luminosity and the radio supernova rate , presented in @xcite , the sfr as a function of 1.4ghz luminosity for our assumed imf",
    "is :    @xmath42    where @xmath37 is equal to 2.39 and 8.85 for 10 and 100myr respectively .",
    "this agrees well with a conversion factor of @xmath43 given by @xcite , which maps non - thermal luminosity to sfr at 1.4ghz .",
    "the small difference arises as pegase - ii  calculates a smaller ( metallicity dependent ) lower mass cut - off for type ii sne than the @xmath44 used in , as convective overshooting increases the mass of the degenerate core , and the chandrasekhar mass is reached more easily ( m.  fioc  2000 , private communication ) , hence the conversion factor above is slightly metallicity dependent ( see table  [ conversion_factors ] ) .",
    "we neglect the small amount of thermal emission at 1.4ghz .",
    "there is some evidence to suggest that the calibration of @xmath5sfr may not be perfectly linear , particularly in low luminosity ( or low sfr ) objects where there is the possibility that a fraction of the sn remnant - accelerated cosmic rays may escape from the galaxy @xcite . in such scenarios , the true sfr for a galaxy",
    "may be underestimated when using the linear relationship presented above .",
    "our ` standard ' scenario then uses the calibrations listed above , and the following implicit assumptions : i ) constant sfhs over recent timescales for the galaxies under study , ii ) a salpeter imf , iii ) solar metallicity and the stellar libraries / evolutionary tracks used in pegase - ii  @xcite , and iv ) a simple , tight and linear relationship between @xmath5  and sfr .",
    "we will discuss the validity of some of these assumptions in later sections .      before analysing the present dataset in more detail ,",
    "it is important to explore possible selection effects that might operate in any comparison where only a subset of one diagnostic set is used . in particular",
    ", we need to determine that any correlations seen in our data are not merely products of the potentially complex selection effects in this study . in this section",
    "we attempt to identify which types of galaxies are excluded from our combined survey due to the different flux limits , and how this might affect any correlations that we see in our data .",
    "our sample has two independent flux limits .",
    "the first arises from the original selection at 2000 , which was limited at @xmath45 , a flux limit of @xmath46 .",
    "the second flux limit is that of the subsequent radio follow - up survey .",
    "we find this can be well approximated by a central @xmath47 region with a @xmath19 sensitivity of @xmath20 and an outer @xmath48 region with a sensitivity of @xmath21 .",
    "the subsequent spectroscopic analysis of the uv - selected sample introduces further biases , as firstly only objects detected in the uv have any h@xmath0 ( or redshift ) information , and secondly only objects in our sample which lie at @xmath49 , the redshift at which h@xmath0 is shifted out of our spectroscopic window , have information on this diagnostic line .    to study these selection criteria , we predict the expected number count distribution of our sample over the foca survey area as a function of apparent uv magnitude ( @xmath50 ) and redshift ( i.e. @xmath51 ) as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is derived from the local ( dust - uncorrected ) uv luminosity function @xmath54 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* s2000 ) , @xmath55 is the spectroscopic completeness as given in s2000 and @xmath56 is the survey area in steradians .    for every galaxy in each @xmath57 bin ,",
    "a variable and moderate dust extinction at 2000  ( @xmath58 ) is then simulated , brightening the uv magnitudes by a random amount of @xmath59mag . to simulate the observational uncertainties",
    ", we apply a random `` error '' to each galaxy measurement based on the observational errors discussed in section  [ data_section ] . to convert these dust - corrected uv magnitudes to an expected 1.4ghz luminosity we use the ratio of the star - forming relations derived in section  [ sec : diagnostic - relations ] . as a sanity check",
    ", we also compare this conversion value with the ratio of the characteristic luminosities ( @xmath60 ) for the uv and 1.4ghz lfs of star - forming galaxies , taken from s2000 and @xcite respectively , and find agreement to within a factor of two .    by studying the relation between",
    "the _ dust - uncorrected _",
    "@xmath28   and the @xmath5  ( derived from the _ corrected _",
    "@xmath28 ) the simulation predicts the form of the relationship on the @xmath5@xmath28  luminosity plane ( including the effects of the observational uncertainties ) we might expect to see if our radio survey were deep enough to detect all the foca galaxies ( figure  [ selection ] ) .    the simulation",
    "is then used to identify areas of the diagnostic plot in which we do not find galaxies due to the selection effects of the sample by excluding those objects that fall below the sensitivity of the radio survey .",
    "the prediction from this simulation is compared in figure  [ selection ] with the actual observed data .",
    "also shown are the `` accessible '' areas of the diagram for galaxies at different redshifts based on the formal flux limits of the two surveys .",
    "clearly we can not detect the majority of the intrinsically low luminosity objects in this study because of the flux limit of the radio survey , and , for a given uv luminosity , those radio galaxies we do detect in our simulation lie along the bottom of the distribution of model galaxies ( i.e. have brighter 1.4ghz luminosities ) .",
    "we are thus biased against objects at low intrinsic radio power but which are bright enough to be detected in the uv ( i.e. faint star - forming or post - starburst objects ) .",
    "this can also be seen by examining the limits by redshift , where the model galaxies lie offset from the line denoting the respective survey limits .",
    "extending the radio survey to fainter flux limits will shift the vertical lines in figure  [ selection ] to the left , allowing a greater fraction of the uv galaxies to be detected at given redshift .",
    "there is also a larger scatter in the observed data , compared to the simulation , which assumes the @xmath28@xmath5  conversion to be perfectly linear .",
    "scatter in the simulations can be generated by varying the adopted dust extinction on the uv luminosities over larger ranges .",
    "however , if we increase the range of @xmath58 in this way , we brighten the predicted radio luminosities and end up with an excess population c.f . the observations .",
    "for example , 14% of the uv galaxies are detected at @xmath61 ; with @xmath62 the predicted fraction of uv galaxies detected in the radio is @xmath63 , for @xmath64 the fraction is @xmath65 , for @xmath66 the fraction is @xmath67 and for @xmath68 the fraction is @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , to generate a large scatter by varying the dust extinction over larger ranges results in the detection of a larger fraction of our uv population at 1.4ghz than is actually observed .",
    "we will return to this subject in section  [ sec : phys - orig - scatt ] .    in summary ,",
    "the simulations in this section reflect the presence of a bias against low power radio sources with moderate dust extinction , which will not appear in our uv survey . however , our conclusion from figure  [ selection ] is that this bias will not significantly affect our results as it does not exclude populations of objects with significantly different properties or luminosities to those that are detected .      with the above selection effects in mind ,",
    "we now consider the uv / h@xmath0/1.4ghz relations .",
    "the uv , h@xmath0 , and 1.4ghz luminosities , uncorrected for dust extinction , are compared in figure  [ correlations ] for galaxies which have such available data .",
    "foca galaxies without a reliable radio detection are shown as upper limits in radio luminosity .",
    "figure  [ correlations ] demonstrates apparent correlations between different sf diagnostics over 34 orders of magnitude , as predicted from section  [ sec : effects - select - bias ] .",
    "we test the strength of these correlations using various statistical methods .",
    "we calculate the linear correlation coefficient ( or `` pearson s r '' ) , as well as the non - parametric spearman rank - order correlation coefficient ( see table  [ fits_table ] ) . in these tests between any two datasets ,",
    "a result of @xmath70 indicates a perfect , positive correlation , @xmath71 indicates a perfect negative correlation , and @xmath72 indicates that the two sets of data are uncorrelated . in all cases the results are @xmath73 , with most @xmath74 , indicating a significant correlation between these sf diagnostics .",
    "additionally , the @xmath29@xmath5  relation appears to be better correlated than @xmath28@xmath5 .",
    "to fit the correlations , we perform a least squares fit weighted by the errors in both variables to be correlated .",
    "we list the resulting @xmath75 , probability of @xmath75 , and the fitted slopes and errors in table  [ fits_table ] .",
    "we note there is a large scatter about these best - fit lines ( figure  [ correlations ] )  with up to an order of magnitude difference between the sfrs derived from different diagnostics  and systematic offsets from the lines of constant sfh .    as expected if the 1.4ghz fluxes reliably trace the sf free from dust extinction , galaxies are under - luminous in h@xmath0 and uv when compared to the 1.4ghz luminosity .",
    "also , there appears to be luminosity dependencies in figure  [ correlations ] ( most pronounced in the uv/1.4ghz plot ) in the sense that the brighter radio sources are more under - luminous in uv , as shown by the slopes of the best - fit lines .",
    "this effect is not seen to such a large extent in the @xmath29@xmath5  plot , though the effect may still be present to some degree .",
    "it is unclear whether this luminosity - dependent effect reflects a non - linearity in the relationship between radio flux and sf or a greater degree of extinction in more energetic systems .",
    "this is quantitatively similar to the situation found by @xcite for a larger , although less homogeneous , sample .",
    "the effect of dust on the h@xmath0 and uv luminosities is a major source of uncertainty . in our previous work ( s2000 ) , in galaxies where both h@xmath0 and h@xmath76 were detected ,",
    "nebular emission lines were corrected using the balmer decrement , and these balmer - derived corrections then extended into the uv using a @xcite reddening law ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an average of these balmer corrections was then used in galaxies where h@xmath76 was not detected at an adequate s / n . after corrections based on the balmer decrement have been applied ( figures  [ correlations_dust]a and  [ correlations_dust]b ) , the sfrs derived from the different diagnostics agree rather better .",
    "however , the h@xmath0/uv luminosities are still generally under - luminous when compared to 1.4ghz luminosities , and the systematic effects and scatter seen before dust correction remain ( table  [ fits_table ] ) .",
    "we investigate the significance of the scatter seen in these plots in two ways .",
    "firstly , we compare the residuals of the 1.4ghz luminosities from the weighted best - fit lines with the measurement errors in the radio luminosities . whilst the residuals show a flat distribution over the range 01.5 ( in log luminosity )",
    ", the distribution of the errors is markedly different , being strongly peaked in the range 00.4 ( again in log - luminosity units ) .",
    "a similar pattern is found for the dust - corrected h@xmath0 and uv measurements .",
    "secondly , we note that the straight line fitting results ( table  [ fits_table ] ) generally give _ poor _ fits to the data for the @xmath5-@xmath28  relation ( denoted by the @xmath75 values ) , even though the datasets are undoubtedly correlated .",
    "this implies that either the observational errors are underestimated ( a scenario we do not believe to be true ) or that the scatter is larger than would be expected for a tight linear correlation .",
    "while the size of this sample is small , making these kinds of tests difficult , we nonetheless conclude that the scatter we see in these plots can not arise purely from observational errors in our data ( see also section  [ sec : effects - select - bias ] ) .",
    "we conclude that although the sf diagnostics correlate over several orders of magnitude , there is a large ( approximately an order of magnitude ) and statistically significant scatter around these correlations which is not removed after simple dust corrections .",
    "this implies that our best - fit correlations are not consistent with calibrations based on constant sfhs , a tight , linear @xmath5sfr relationship , _ and _ extinction corrections which are independent of galaxy luminosity .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the implications of the results of section  [ sec : observ - results ] and try to resolve the apparent discrepancies highlighted there .",
    "the major features of the dataset are the offsets ( and non - linearities ) when compared to our standard scenario , and the scatter that we see around the best - fit lines of the correlations .",
    "we start with the hypothesis that the non - linearity observed in figure  [ correlations ] is due to the inclusion of active galaxies , or at least objects where sf is not the dominant emission mechanism at radio frequencies ( for example agn , where the radio emission may be dominated by a nuclear `` monster '' ) . to investigate this , we search for evidence of different populations in the spectra of the galaxies : those with detected _ narrow - line _ h@xmath0 emission ( i.e. _ known _ to be star - forming ) and those with weak or non - existent h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we exclude those galaxies observed with the wiyn , where the spectral wavelength coverage is insufficient to detect h@xmath0 . of the remainder",
    ", only one galaxy has no detectable h@xmath0 emission ( formally a fraction of 4% , compared with @xmath77 in the foca sample as a whole ) , and it lies away from the remainder of the galaxies ( marked on figure  [ correlations ] ) . we see evidence that the 1.4ghz luminosity varies as a function of @xmath78 colour ( with higher luminosity systems being bluer ) , and note that the object with no h@xmath0 is the reddest object in our sample ( @xmath79 c.f . a median @xmath80 for this sample ) .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario that objects with little or no h@xmath0 emission are weakly star - forming or early - type galaxies , possibly hosting agns , which are responsible for the observed uv and 1.4ghz luminosities .",
    "no evidence is found for other significant agn contamination ( e.g. broad emission lines or unusual emission line ratios ) in those objects with h@xmath0 emission ( see s2000 for a fuller discussion ; see also contini et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we conclude that whilst there are undoubtedly agn and non star - forming galaxies present in our sample , we find no evidence that they are responsible for the scatter and non - linearities in the observed relations .",
    "one of most interesting results from this study is the slopes of the best - fit relations , which are significantly different from those expected , assuming constant sf scenarios ( i.e. a slope of one , see section  [ sec : effects - select - bias ] ) .",
    "one possibility is using the @xcite extinction result to apply optical extinction measures ( the balmer ratio ) at uv wavelengths is not appropriate for our sample of galaxies , for example if complex dust geometries ensured a non - trivial relation between h@xmath0 and uv attenuations .",
    "until some independent measure of the uv extinction is available  for example measures at other uv wavelengths in addition to 2000  such a possibility must be deferred to a later analysis .",
    "there appear to be two other possible explanations for these observed non - linearities ( as well as non - uniformities in the sfh which we discuss in the next section ) ; the related effect of a luminosity - dependent dust correction , and a non - linearity in the @xmath5sfr calibration .",
    "we discuss each in turn .",
    "our previous dust corrections take little account of any possible luminosity dependence , as only few galaxies posses h@xmath0 , h@xmath76 and 1.4ghz emission .",
    "such luminosity effects could arise if intensely star - forming galaxies ( i.e. those with larger 1.4ghz luminosities ) , or the star - forming regions of these galaxies , posses dustier environments .",
    "@xcite investigated such effects in a local sample of galaxies , and demonstrated that the uv(2000)/fir ratio decreases with increasing fir luminosity , implying that the dust opacity may increase in more strongly star - forming environments .",
    "if such effects were present in our sample , then dust corrections which accounted for this would have the effect of ` rotating ' our best - fit lines in an anti - clockwise direction .    to investigate this in more detail , we follow @xcite and attempt to derive a relation between the intrinsic sfr in a galaxy and the extinction present .",
    "ideally , this could be done by examining the h@xmath0/h@xmath76 trend with a sf diagnostic unaffected by dust , e.g. the 1.4ghz luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , the sample size of objects with radio , h@xmath0 and h@xmath76 detections is currently so small that such a comparison is not conclusive .    instead , to explore the consequence of a luminosity dependence , we appeal to the full sample of s2000 galaxies ( whether or not they have a radio detection in the present survey ) and correlate the h@xmath0/h@xmath76 ratio with both _ uncorrected _ and _ balmer - corrected _",
    "h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "we see a clear trend in both cases , with intrinsically brighter h@xmath0 luminosity galaxies having a larger h@xmath0/h@xmath76 ratio , even before dust correction of the h@xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrate this relationship in figure  [ ratio_sfr ] .",
    "it is important to realize that this relationship has a large scatter ( partly due to the uncertainties in determining the h@xmath0 and h@xmath76 fluxes ",
    "see s2000 ) , and so such corrections should only be used in a statistical manner .    by fitting the corrected relationship ( weighted by the errors in both the balmer ratio and the h@xmath0 luminosity ) , we are able to construct an observed relationship between the intrinsic sfr in an object ( as governed by the corrected h@xmath0 emission ) and the balmer decrement , which can then be used for a subsequent dust correction .",
    "this fitted relationship is    @xmath81    and has a correlation coefficient of 0.65 .",
    "@xcite use this technique , but derive the sfrs independently from fir observations .",
    "this approach is obviously to be preferred , as the fir provides a measure of the intrinsic sfr independently from the h@xmath0 measure used above .",
    "they find @xmath82 , in remarkably good agreement with the above estimate despite differences in sample selection and the sf diagnostic used to determine the dust - corrected sfr .",
    "therefore , for each object detected in our radio survey ",
    "i.e. with an independent measure of ( presumed ) dust - free sf at 1.4ghz  we can correct the observed h@xmath0 and uv luminosities using equation  ( 6 ) and a @xcite law to extend to uv wavelengths .",
    "obviously , such an approach can only correct the general trend seen in our sample , and will not remove the galaxy to galaxy scatter .",
    "the resulting correlations are shown in figure  [ correlations_lumdependent ] .",
    "the slope of the best - fit line is now closer to unity ( predicted in constant sf scenarios and with linear 1.4ghz to sfr conversions ) , though the uv/1.4ghz relation is still slightly too shallow .",
    "adopting the @xcite correction gives an almost identical result .",
    "larger and deeper samples are clearly needed with a more comprehensive wavelength coverage , but this first analysis suggests that empirical , luminosity - dependent extinction corrections can go some way to explaining the slopes of our best - fit relations .    the second explanation considers the validity of the calibration of the 1.4ghz luminosities and the conversion into a sfr .",
    "this calibration is based on the observed conversion values of the non - thermal radio luminosity to the supernova rate of our own galaxy .",
    "if , in small ( or low - sfr ) galaxies , cosmic ray electrons were able to escape more easily than in larger systems , or at least have a different escape fraction compared to our galaxy , one may underestimate the radio - derived sfr in low luminosity systems , and possibly overestimate in high - luminosity systems ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such an effect could generate a similar ` luminosity - dependent ' effect to that observed .",
    "a full analysis of this complex issue must await a more complete dataset .",
    "the second major feature in our data is the statistically significant scatter around the best - fit lines . as we saw in section",
    "[ sec : effects - select - bias ] , generating this scatter via an increased range of dust extinctions in our sample raises difficulties in reconciling the radio - detected fraction of uv galaxies with those expected in simulations ( assuming a @xcite law ) .",
    "we investigate this effect in several ways by examining the variation of the h@xmath0/uv ratio as a function of 1.4ghz luminosity ( figure  [ ratio_bursts ] ) .",
    "this diagnostic diagram is the least sensitive to dust , affected only by _ differential extinction _ between h@xmath0 and the uv ( assuming the radio data are dust free ) . also included on figure 6 is the position of each galaxy , using different extinction corrections , based on the balmer decrement , the luminosity - dependent corrections and the range of corrections corresponding to visual extinctions of @xmath83 .",
    "again , we adopt the @xcite law to extend the extinction corrections into the uv .",
    "figure  [ ratio_bursts ] implies that , for a constant sfr , it is unlikely that dust or imf variations ( i.e. varying the upper mass cut - off ) are sufficient to explain the scatter . even considering the full range of dust corrections , some galaxies have h@xmath0/uv ratios that can not be reproduced .",
    "we conclude that while a significant fraction of the scatter in this diagram is due to different levels of dust extinction among the galaxies , these dust corrections can not ( in their present form ) explain the entire dataset .",
    "other more complex dust geometries , for example that of @xcite which models the time - varying attenuation of h@xmath0 line emission and uv continuum , will again be deferred to a later paper .    in s2000 , a comparison of h@xmath0 and uv luminosities for the entire foca sample revealed discrepancies that were difficult to reconcile within the framework of simple dust corrections . therefore , s2000 considered the possibility that a fraction of the foca galaxies were undergoing bursts of short - term , intensive sf , which were able to explain the observed dataset to a certain degree .",
    "such scenarios naturally generate a scatter on the h@xmath0/uv/1.4ghz planes due to differing dependencies on the timescale of sf of these different diagnostics ( see section  [ sec : diagnostic - relations ] ) .",
    "for example , uv continuum radiation is present after the completion of a starburst for a longer duration than nebular or radio emission . by applying this hypothesis to the current dataset , we attempt to explain the likely cause of the observed trends in figure  [ correlations ] and [ correlations_dust ] . whilst this dataset is too small for a thorough quantitative analysis , we can nevertheless test the reliability of such approach .",
    "therefore , we relax the assumption of a constant sfh and consider a temporally varying sfh for our field galaxies .",
    "this is done by superimposing exponential starbursts of varying strength and duration onto underlying exponential sfhs , as a function of time , thereby simulating a ` star - bursting + evolved population ' galaxy , from which we can use pegase - ii  to estimate the evolution of the h@xmath0 , uv , and 1.4ghz luminosities over time ( see section  [ sec : diagnostic - relations ] ) .",
    "the effect of varying the burst parameters is demonstrated in figure  [ ratio_bursts ] by assuming different bursts corresponding to over reasonable ranges ( 535% and 10110myr duration ) .",
    "the bursts occur at a galactic age of 6gyr . for illustrative purposes , each artificial galaxy has a mass of @xmath84 , of course in reality this is unlikely to be true , but we must await near - ir data to explore this further .",
    "it is clear that all of the scatter could be explained in terms of a temporally varying sfhs using bursts of different parameters , though with this small sample size it is not possible to constrain the burst parameters in any meaningful manner .",
    "we have presented the first results from a decimetric radio survey of nearby galaxies , with the ultimate goal of comparing sf diagnostics for a homogeneous sample of star - forming galaxies .",
    "we find broad correlations over several orders of magnitude between the different sf diagnostics but with a large galaxy - to - galaxy scatter and offsets / non - linearities from relations predicted using simple dust extinction and sf scenarios . by dividing our sample into two ( those with and without _ detected _ h@xmath0 emission )",
    ", we tentatively conclude that the scatter and offsets that we see are not due to a significant non - starforming population of galaxies .",
    "we find evidence for luminosity - dependent effects in our dataset , and show that luminosity dependent dust corrections or a mis - calibration of the 1.4ghz - sfr calibration , or a combination of both , can go some way to resolving this effect .",
    "we also demonstrate that , over realistic ranges , differential extinction between galaxies can not be solely responsible for the scatter in our relations ; indeed our dataset argues against significant extinction in our sample .",
    "we conclude the discrepancies between different sf diagnostics can only be partly explained by simple models of dust extinction in galaxies .",
    "these models can not by themselves explain all the observed differences , introducing the need for temporally varying sfhs and/or more complex models of extinction , to explain the entire dataset .",
