    "the measurement of the longitudinal proton structure function had long been recognised as an important part of the hera programme .",
    "the first estimates on the measurement accuracy of @xmath0were presented more than 20 years ago within the 1987 workshop on hera physics  @xcite . in 1996",
    "both experiments had pursued quite some preparations for the measurement of @xmath0with lowered proton beam energies  @xcite .",
    "the measurement was yet postponed by @xmath3 years , basically for clarification of anomalies in the data at large scales , which were possibly related to leptoquarks and to peculiar events with isolated leptons accompanied by large missing transverse momentum  @xcite . in 2004 , at the annual dis workshop the interest in a measurement of @xmath0was renewed  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the hera collider had successfully completed a luminosity upgrade program which for the @xmath0measurement was particularly important as the luminosity decreases @xmath4 with the proton beam energy . in 2005 ( 2006 )",
    "the h1 ( zeus ) experiments did request to lower the proton beam energy in order to measure @xmath0prior to the termination of hera which had been announced for june 2007 .",
    "both experiments had performed essential upgrades on their detector , h1 with the spacal calorimeter , a backward silicon tracker and improved trigger and backward chambers , zeus with a micro vertex silicon detector and a renewed electron tagging device .",
    "both experiments therefore were well prepared for a measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "the understanding of the machine had reached a most impressive level  @xcite , as became clear during the low energy run when the optics , the polarisation ( for hermes ) , the luminosity and the overall operation efficiency were all up to or even beyond expectation .",
    "the data have promptly been analysed by both collaborations .",
    "data were taken with proton beam energies of @xmath5gev and @xmath6gev and compared with existing high energy data at @xmath7gev while the positron beam energy was kept constant , @xmath8gev . at the dis08 workshop",
    "first observations were reported by both collaborations  @xcite : the h1 collaboration had released its first data for both lower proton energies , using the backward calorimeter spacal and the central liquid argon calorimeter ( lar ) .",
    "the zeus collaboration did present a first analysis on their @xmath9gev data set .",
    "the present report is based on updates by h1 and zeus prepared for the ichep conference : the spacal data of h1 were published  @xcite while zeus did present a combined @xmath0 analysis based on also the @xmath6gev data .",
    "the measurements presented to ichep08 were the first ever direct determinations of @xmath0 in the region of low bjorken @xmath1 .",
    "data at large @xmath1 had been obtained by a number of fixed target lepton - proton scattering experiments  @xcite , beginning with the discovery at slac that the ratio @xmath10 was close to zero which was a most convincing evidence for quarks to be spin @xmath11 fermions .",
    "while subsequent measurements with muon and neutrino beams mostly observed small values of @xmath12 , indirect measurements of @xmath0by h1  @xcite did hint to larger values of the longitudinal proton structure function at low @xmath1 .",
    "this had been expected , in the region of deep inelastic scattering , from the large size of the gluon distribution in this range . while @xmath12 at large @xmath1 is a measure of the quark s spin , at low @xmath1 it rather quantifies the dynamics of gluon interactions and as such is of particular theoretical interest  @xcite .",
    "the inclusive , deep inelastic electron - proton scattering cross section at low @xmath13 , written in its reduced form , @xmath14 is defined by two proton structure functions , @xmath15and @xmath0 , where @xmath13 is the negative four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath16 the inelasticity @xmath17 with @xmath18 , @xmath19 the centre of mass energy squared given by the positron and the proton beam energies and @xmath20 is the fine structure constant .",
    "apparently , @xmath21 is a direct measure of @xmath15apart from a limited region of high @xmath16 , corresponding to small @xmath1 , where the contribution of @xmath0may be sizeable .",
    "disentangling the two cross section terms requires to measure @xmath21 at fixed @xmath1 and @xmath13 at various beam energies .",
    "the analysis of the reduced cross section determines @xmath15as the intercept , at @xmath22 , and @xmath0as the negative slope of its linear dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "the variation in @xmath16 was achieved at hera by comparing high statistics data at highest energy with about @xmath24pb@xmath25 of data at @xmath9gev and @xmath26pb@xmath25 at @xmath6gev .",
    "the values of @xmath27 had been chosen for about equidistant separation of the measurements in @xmath23 .",
    "the low energy runs took place from march to june 2007 , with only a few days of setup time for the machine .",
    "the inelasticity is determined by the energy and polar angle of the scattered positron , @xmath28 , which at large scattering angles , corresponding to small @xmath29 , reduces to @xmath30 .",
    "if therefore one intends to measure the cross section at high @xmath31 one needs to master the trigger rate and the electron identification at small energies of a few gev .",
    "such energies are deposited much more frequently by hadrons from photoproduction processes , for which @xmath32 , than by the genuine scattered dis positron .",
    "removal of the photoproduction background constitutes the major challenge of the measurement of @xmath0at hera .",
    "there are two ways to control the photoproduction ( @xmath33 ) background : part of the @xmath33 events is uniquely identified by tagging the scattered positron near to the beam axis in tagging calorimeters downstream the @xmath34 beam . that measurement can be used to tune the monte carlo simulation of the background , subject to uncertainties of the tagger acceptance and its extrapolation . in a further method",
    "one can employ the charge symmetry of the background . while a dis positron carries the lepton beam charge ,",
    "energy depositions due to hadrons from @xmath33 processes are charge symmetric , apart from a small proton - antiproton cross section difference one can correct for . with a tracking detector in front of the calorimeter one may determine the charge of the dis lepton candidate and subtract the wrong charge signal statistically .",
    "zeus has subtracted the background with a tagger based simulation , for @xmath35gev , in which subprocesses simulated in pythia are weighted using zeus @xmath33 cross section data .",
    "h1 has primarily used the charge measurement and included data for @xmath36gev . both analyses require a track detector signal associated to the calorimeter energy deposition which reduces the contribution from neutral particles , in particular of the electromagnetic energy deposition from @xmath37 .",
    "energy momentum conservation is imposed requiring @xmath38gev , for h1 ( zeus ) , which further reduces the @xmath33 background and higher order qed effects .",
    "extraction of @xmath39 for each @xmath40 is achieved by fitting the cross section measurements as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "utilising the large range in inelasticity @xmath16 , both the zeus and the h1 analyses at this stage have renormalised the measured cross sections at low @xmath16 where at each energy , for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath13 , the same @xmath41measurement is provided by the measurements of @xmath21 from the up to three data sets .",
    "the systematic errors are taken into account source by source in an offset method which leads to a reduction of their effect on the final measurement .",
    "the resulting measurement of zeus , for @xmath42gev@xmath43 , is illustrated in figure  [ figflzeusprel ] .",
    "the preliminary result is compared with a zeus qcd fit to nlo to previous zeus dis and jet data . at low @xmath1 and",
    "not too small @xmath13 the prediction on @xmath0relies nearly completely on the behaviour of the gluon distribution .",
    "that is determined at low @xmath1 by the scaling violations of @xmath41 .",
    "the consistency of the theoretical calculation on @xmath0@xcite with the data is therefore a non - trivial test of qcd to high orders .    for h1 ,",
    "a combination of the published , medium @xmath13 , result based on spacal data  @xcite , for @xmath44gev@xmath43 , with a preliminary result based on lar data at higher @xmath13 , @xmath45gev@xmath43 , is shown in figure  [ figflh1prel ] .",
    "the overlap of the cross section measurements with the two calorimeters at different @xmath27 reduces the uncertainty on the @xmath0measurement , compared to  @xcite . at each value of @xmath13 one value on @xmath0is",
    "derived which results from an average of typically three data points adjacent in @xmath1 .",
    "the data are compared with three qcd predictions at higher orders , from the h1pdf2000 fit and recent cteq and mstw fits on the parton distributions .",
    "the qcd predictions describe the measurements well .",
    "there are two additional observations worth mentioning here : i ) at low @xmath1 one expects that @xmath46 /2 @xmath0is approximately one , because both the derivative @xcite and @xmath0@xcite to lo are proportional to the dominating gluon density . from the published h1 data on the derivative and on @xmath0 , for @xmath13 between @xmath3 and @xmath47gev@xmath43 , this ratio is determined to be @xmath46 /2 @xmath0@xmath48 and indeed consistent with one ; ii ) the measurement of @xmath0is also consistent with predictions within the dipole model , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in particular , no violation is observed of the constraint @xmath49 which reflects the wave function relations in the dipole model  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are the first , not the final measurements of @xmath2 at low @xmath1 at hera .",
    "there are a number of improvements being investigated regarding the extension of the kinematic range to lower @xmath13 , to lower and possibly higher @xmath16 , the understanding of the systematic errors , of the @xmath33 background in particular , or the unfolding of @xmath15and @xmath0from the measured cross sections .",
    "one can thus expect the accuracy of @xmath0to be enhanced in the future .",
