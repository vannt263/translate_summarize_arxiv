    "our second goal was to check whether the additional parameter freedom can improve on the high scale ewft parameter @xmath3 . in this regard ,",
    "we find improvements by factors ranging up to @xmath251 ! in order to generate low values of @xmath3 , one must generate @xmath213 gev as usual , but also one must start with @xmath252 at the gut scale , and then generate relatively little change @xmath167 during evolution from @xmath11 to @xmath253 .",
    "small values of @xmath167 can be found if one begins with electroweak gaugino masses @xmath254 at the gut scale so that gaugino - induced rg evolution dominates at high @xmath255 .",
    "then at lower @xmath101 values approaching the weak scale , top - yukawa terms dominate the running of @xmath31 , leading to broken electroweak symmetry , but also to not much net change in @xmath31 during its evolution from @xmath11 to @xmath253 .",
    "the solutions with low @xmath3 are characterized by the presence of four light higgsinos @xmath214 and @xmath146 similar to rns models . however , in contrast to rns models , the third generation squarks tend to be lighter ( although not as light as generic natural susy which favors @xmath256 gev ) .",
    "the lighter third generation squarks lead to significant susy contributions to the decay @xmath12 , and seem to be disfavored by the measured value of this branching fraction . in the case of low @xmath3 models , the lightest neutralino is more higgsino - like than in rns models , leading to even lower values of predicted relic density and low direct detection rates",
    ". the remaining cdm abundance may be augmented by scalar field or axino / saxion production and decay in the early universe , and in the latter case , the additional presence of axions is expected .",
