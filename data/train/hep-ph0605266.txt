    "the extent to which gluons are polarized in the nucleon , and consequently the origin of the nucleon spin , has persisted as an elusive question for almost two decades in spite of strenuous experimental efforts and theoretical activity @xcite .",
    "although the spin dependent gluon density in principle can be sized in inclusive deep inelastic scattering measurements , mainly through the scale dependence of the measured asymmetries , this dependence is rather mild in the kinematical range accessed by experiments , and conclusions about it are also veiled by our ignorance regarding the polarization of the other partonic species , which also contribute to the scale dependence , specially that of sea quarks .",
    "therefore , even in the most ambitious scenario , inclusive deep inelastic scattering data can at most suggest mild constraints on the gluon polarization .    in a recent article @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the enduring efforts to measure less inclusive observables in deep inelastic scattering have finally begun to yield , allowing combined next to leading order global qcd fits to inclusive and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering data where sea quarks and gluons are much more definitely constrained . in the mean time , independent measurements of other less inclusive observables , such as pion production in polarized proton - proton collisions @xcite , and high transverse momentum hadron pair production in deep inelastic scattering have begun to provide more direct assessments of the gluon polarization with competing precision @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to compare the gluon polarization estimates coming from both the global analysis of deep inelastic scattering data and from the more direct measurements . in the following",
    "we perform such comparison and we find that although preliminary direct measurements still have a moderate impact in the fits , there is a remarkable agreement and complementarity between both approaches , what encourage us to incorporate the forthcoming data in future global analysis .",
    "in the case of inclusive and semi - inclusive polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , the next to leading order ( nlo ) qcd framework required to compute the respective observables have been available for some time @xcite , and indeed recent global analyses have demonstrated both the relevance of these corrections and also the non negligible impact of most recent semi - inclusive data @xcite .",
    "specifically , in reference @xcite it has been found that the best global qcd fits to combined dis data constrain the gluon polarization to be moderately positive with a first moment of this density @xmath1 of @xmath2 at @xmath3 with an uncertainty range given by @xmath4 $ ] for a one - unit increase in @xmath5 and by @xmath6 $ ] allowing a more conservative @xmath7 variation of @xmath5 . in these constraints , both the requirement of positivity of the polarized parton densities relative to a modern set of unpolarized parton densities @xcite , and the correlation between gluon and sea quark polarization , are found to be crucial . fits with a wide variation in the gluon polarization reproduce inclusive data equally well , however they are clearly differentiated because of their sea quark polarization by semi - inclusive data .",
    "the cross section for single inclusive large @xmath0 pion production in longitudinally polarized proton - proton collisions , which is right now being measured at brookhaven national laboratory relativistiv heavy ion collider ( bnl rhic ) @xcite have also been computed at nlo accuracy , and have been found to be significantly dependent on @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "recently , the phenix collaboration has presented preliminary results with considerably reduced errors @xcite which clearly disfavors scenarios with large gluon polarization and are in nice agreement with estimates of updated polarized fits . in figure",
    "[ deltag]a we show the expectation for the double spin asymmetry computed with the best fit of reference @xcite , together with the data reported by phenix @xcite .",
    "we also plot the uncertainty band associated to a @xmath9 variation .",
    "@xcite compared with the estimate coming from the the nlo fit of reference @xcite and the uncertainty band allowing @xmath9 ; ( b ) the same but for estimates for @xmath10 from @xcite .",
    "[ deltag],title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   @xcite compared with the estimate coming from the the nlo fit of reference @xcite and the uncertainty band allowing @xmath9 ;",
    "( b ) the same but for estimates for @xmath10 from @xcite .",
    "[ deltag],title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    the @xmath5 for phenix data obtained with the best fit of reference @xcite , which is previous to the latest set of phenix data , and computed including the 40% scaling uncertainty in the nondiagonal covariance matrix , results to be @xmath11 , for @xmath12 data points , which is well within the @xmath13 range expected for a given subset of data in global fit and therefore should be considered as consistent .",
    "the value for @xmath5 is comparable to the one obtained ( @xmath14 ) in a recent fit @xcite to both inclusive dis data and the phenix measurement , although not including the scaling error in the computation .",
    "similar agreement is found comparing the expectation of the fit for @xmath15 at @xmath16 gev@xmath17 against preliminary data from compass @xcite , and previous measurements @xcite , as shown in figure  [ deltag]b . in this case",
    "we include both the leading order ( lo ) and the nlo expectation because the reported values for @xmath15 correspond to a lo extraction improved with montecarlo higher order corrections .",
    "we include in the plot the uncertainty band coming from a 2% variation in @xmath5 , plus that coming from varying @xmath18 up to @xmath19 gev@xmath17 , what again highlights the nice consistency between independent data set and the frameworks implemented for the corresponding analyses .",
    "further insight on the interplay between dis data and that coming from phenix can be obtained analyzing the profile of @xmath5 function for the different subsets of data in a combined fit , against the range of variation of the net gluon polarization , as it was done in @xcite . in figure  [ profile ] we show the profile of the total @xmath5 of a global fit to inclusive and semi - inclusive data along the lines of that of reference @xcite but also including phenix data as a solid line .",
    "the curve has similar shape to the one found in @xcite but shifted upwards between eleven and thirteen units , which is essentially the partial contribution of @xmath20 to @xmath5 . in order to see the relevance of @xmath20 data , this last contribution",
    "is also plotted as a dashed - dotted line with an offset 430.91 units , which the partial contribution of dis data @xmath21@xmath22 for the best fit .",
    "notice the partial contribution of @xmath20 is almost flat around the minimum of @xmath5 and reaches its own minimum for slightly lower values of @xmath23 but within the one - unit variation of @xmath5 , what highlights the consistency between both data sets .     of different sets of data against the gluon net polarization .",
    "[ profile],width=432 ]    in figure  [ profile ] we have plotted also the profile obtained for dis data only in @xcite as a dashed line , with an offset given by the partial contribution of @xmath20 at its minimun @xmath21@xmath24 , in order to see the net effects on the fit of phenix data . in table [ tab : table1 ] we show the partial contributions to @xmath5 at both minima .",
    ".[tab : table1 ] partial contributions to @xmath5 values and first moment of @xmath8 at @xmath25 gev@xmath17 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     clearly , these effects are almost imperceptible around the minimum but can be noticed for @xmath5@xmath26 variations between the one - unit and the @xmath7 increase .",
    "close to the minimum of @xmath5 , the decrease of @xmath5@xmath24 for decreasing @xmath23 is overpowered by the increase of @xmath5@xmath22 and consequently , the position of the minimum remains that found for dis data .",
    "given the large number of dis data included in the fit ( 478 ) compared to the rather limited set of @xmath20 available at present , the small impact in the fit is not surprising , nevertheless the consistency shown , and the possibility of increasing considerably the statistics in the future is encouraging .",
    "we have compared the constraints on the gluon polarization in the nucleon obtained in next to leading order global qcd fits to polarized deep inelastic scattering data with those coming the double spin asymmetry measured by phenix at rhic .",
    "although the relative statistical weight of @xmath20 data in a global nlo fit including also dis data is rather limited , we find a remarkable agreement and moderate improvement when combining both data sets . in the case of other direct measurements such as high-@xmath0 hadron production studied by compass at cern , the lack of a nlo framework for the computation of the corresponding asymmetries does not allow to include them yet in a combined nlo global analysis",
    "however we find preliminary agreement which hopefully will be checked at nlo accuracy in the near future .",
