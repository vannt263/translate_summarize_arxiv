    "the wilberforce pendulum consists of a mass hanging on a flexible spiral spring that is free to oscillate in both the standard longitudinal mode and the torsional mode . when the mass is lifted above its equilibrium point and released from rest , it oscillates up and down along a vertical line , slowly transferring its energy into a rotational oscillation .",
    "if the nuts screwed onto the vanes protruding from the sides of the mass are adjusted to give the appropriate moment of inertia such that the frequencies of the longitudinal mode and the torsional mode are the same , the pendulum will transfer its energy back and forth completely between these two modes os oscillation , see @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to the wilberforce spring - pendulum when the spring is free to swing in a plane , thus adding an extra degree of freedom . this system displays evidence inherent to chaotic dynamical systems .",
