    "our understanding of critical phenomena has been significantly advanced with the development of the renormalization - group ( rg ) theory@xcite .",
    "the rg theory predicts relationships between groups of exponents and that there is a universal behavior . in a second order phase transition ,",
    "the correlation length @xmath7 diverges as the critical point is approached , and so the details of the microscopic hamiltonian are unimportant for the critical behavior .",
    "all members of a given universality class have identical critical behavior and critical exponents .",
    "the three - dimensional classical xy model is relevant to the critical behavior of many physical systems , such as superfluid @xmath8 , magnetic materials and the high - tc superconductors . in the pseudospin notation ,",
    "this model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath9 where the summation is over all nearest neighbor pairs of sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 on a simple cubic lattice . in this model",
    "one considers that the spin has two components , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    "we wish to consider a three component local spin @xmath14 and the same hamiltonian as given by eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) ( namely , with no coupling between the z - components of the spins ) in three dimensions .",
    "even though the hamiltonian is the same , namely , there is no coupling between the z - component of the spins , the constrain for each spin is @xmath15 , which implies that the quantity @xmath16 is fluctuating . in order",
    "to be distinguished from the usual xy model , the name _ planar magnet model _ will be adopted for this model .",
    "the reason for our desire to study this model is that it is related directly to the so - called model - f@xcite used to study non - equilibrium phenomena in systems , such as superfluids , with a two - component order parameter and a conserved current . in the planar magnet model ,",
    "the order parameter is not a constant of the motion .",
    "a constant of the motion is the @xmath17 component of the magnetization .",
    "thus , there is an important relationship between the order parameter and the @xmath17 component of magnetization , which is expressed by a poisson - bracket relation@xcite .",
    "this equation is crucial for the hydrodynamics and the critical dynamics of the system .",
    "one therefore needs to find out the critical properties of this model in order to study non - equilibrium properties of superfluids or other systems described by the model f. in future work , we shall use model - f to describe the dynamical critical phenomena of superfluid helium . before such a project",
    "is undertaken , the static critical properties of the planar magnet model should be investigated accurately .",
    "although the static properties of the @xmath2 model with @xmath18 have been investigated by a variety of statistical - mechanical methods@xcite , the system with @xmath19 has been given much less attention .",
    "so far the critical behavior of this model has been studied by high temperature expansion@xcite and monte carlo(mc ) simulation methods@xcite .",
    "high temperature expansion provides the value for the critical temperature and the critical exponents . in these recent mc calculations@xcite",
    ", only the critical temperature is determined .",
    "these mc calculations were carried out on small size systems and thus only rough estimates are available .",
    "in this paper we study the three - dimensional planar magnet model using a hybrid monte carlo method ( a combination of the cluster algorithm with over - relaxation and metropolis spin re - orientation algorithm ) in conjuction with single - histogram re - weighting technique and finite - size scaling .",
    "we calculate the fourth order cumulant , the magnetization , and the susceptibility ( on cubic lattices @xmath20 with @xmath21 up to @xmath22 ) and from their finite - size scaling behavior we determine the critical properties of the planar magnet model accurately .",
    "let us first summarize the definitions of the observables that are calculated in our simulation .",
    "the energy density of our model is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and the angular brackets denote the thermal average .",
    "the fourth - order cumulant @xmath25@xcite can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the magnetization per spin , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the coupling , or the reduced inverse temperature in units of @xmath30 .",
    "the fourth - order cumulant @xmath25 is one important quantity which we use to determine the critical coupling constant @xmath31 . in the scaling region close to the critical coupling ,",
    "the fourth - order cumulant @xmath25 as function of @xmath32 for different values of @xmath21 are lines which go through the same point .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility per spin @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the magnetization vector per spin .",
    "the three - dimensional planar magnet model with ferromagnetic interactions @xmath36 has a second - order phase transition . in simulations of systems near a second - order phase transition , a major difficulty arises which is known as critical slowing down .",
    "the critical slowing down can be reduced by using several techniques and what we found as optimal for our case was to use the hybrid monte carlo algorithm as described in ref .",
    "equilibrium configurations were created using a hybrid monte carlo algorithm which combines cluster updates of in - plane spin components@xcite with metropolis and over - relaxation@xcite of spin re - orientations .",
    "after each single - cluster update , two metropolis and eight over - relaxation sweeps were performed@xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 dependence of the fourth - order cumulant @xmath25 was determined using the single - histogram re - weighting method@xcite .",
    "this method enables us to obtain accurate thermodynamic information over the entire scaling region using monte carlo simulations performed at only a few different values of @xmath32 .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulation on simple cubic lattices of size @xmath37 with @xmath38 using periodic boundary conditions applied in all directions and @xmath39 mc steps .",
    "we carried out of the order of 10000 thermalization steps and of the order of 20000 measurements .",
    "after we estimated the critical coupling @xmath31 , we computed the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility at the critical coupling @xmath31 .",
    "in this section , we first have to determine the critical coupling @xmath31 , and then to examine the static behavior around @xmath31 .",
    "binder s fourth - order cumulant@xcite @xmath25 is a convenient quantity that we use in order to estimate the critical coupling @xmath31 and the correlation length exponent @xmath4 .    near the critical coupling @xmath31",
    ", the cumulant is expanded as @xmath40 therefore , if we plot @xmath25 versus the coupling @xmath32 for several different sizes @xmath21 , it is expected that the curves for different values of @xmath21 cross at the critical coupling @xmath31 . in order to find the @xmath32 dependence of the fourth - order cumulant @xmath25 , we performed simulations for each lattice size from @xmath41 to @xmath42 at @xmath32=0.6450 which is chosen to be close to previous estimates for the critical inverse temperature@xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 curves were calculated from the histograms and are shown in fig .",

    "for the pair which corresponds to our largest lattice sizes @xmath21=32 and 42 , the point where they cross is @xmath43 . in order to extract more precise critical coupling @xmath31 from our data ,",
    "we compare the curves of @xmath44 for the two different lattice sizes @xmath21 and @xmath45 and then find the location of the intersection of two different curves @xmath44 and @xmath46 . as a result of the residual corrections to the finite size scaling @xcite , the locations depend on the scale factor @xmath47 .",
    "we used the crossing points of the @xmath21=12 , 14 , and , 16 curves with all the other ones with higher @xmath48 value respectively .",
