    "lattice computations of the potential of a pair of static - light mesons ( in the following also referred to as @xmath0 mesons ) are of interest , because they constitute first principles determinations of a hadronic force .",
    "such potentials can e.g.  be used as input for phenomenological calculations to determine , whether two @xmath0 mesons may form a bound tetraquark state .    in the literature interactions between static - light mesons",
    "have been studied in the quenched approximation @xcite and recently also with dynamical quarks @xcite . here",
    "i report on the status of an investigation with two flavors of dynamical wilson twisted mass quarks .",
    "forces are not only studied between the lightest static - light mesons ( denoted by @xmath1 ) , but for the first time also first excitations are taken into account ( denoted by @xmath2 ) .",
    "quantum numbers of single static - light mesons as well as of pairs of static - light mesons ( @xmath3 systems ) have been discussed in detail in @xcite . in the following",
    "i give a brief summary .",
    "i consider static - light mesons made from a static antiquark @xmath4 and a light quark @xmath5 without non - trivial gluonic excitations .",
    "they can be labeled by the @xmath6-component of isospin @xmath7 , the @xmath6-component of the light quark spin @xmath8 and parity @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 static - light meson ( denoted by @xmath1 , corresponding to @xmath0/@xmath11 in @xcite ) is the lightest static - light meson . it is lighter by around @xmath12 than its parity partner with @xmath13 ( denoted by @xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the corresponding static - light meson trial states are @xmath16 and + @xmath17 for @xmath1 mesons and @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath2 mesons , respectively .    for a more detailed discussion of static - light mesons",
    "i refer to @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to compute the potential of a pair of @xmath0 mesons as a function of their separation @xmath20 ( without loss of generality i choose the axis of separation to be the @xmath6 axis ) . to this end",
    "one has to compute the energies of eigenstates of the qcd hamiltonian containing two static antiquarks @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which define the positions of the two @xmath0 mesons , and which will be surrounded by light quarks and gluons .",
    "these @xmath3 states are characterized by the following five quantum numbers : isospin @xmath25 , the @xmath6-component of isospin @xmath26 , the absolute value of the @xmath6-component of the light quark spin @xmath27 , parity @xmath9 and `` @xmath28-parity '' ( reflection along the @xmath28-axis ) @xmath29 .",
    "i use @xmath3 trial states @xmath30 where the lower indices @xmath31 , @xmath0 and @xmath32 denote spinor indices , @xmath33 is the charge conjugation matrix and @xmath34 is a suitably chosen combination of @xmath35 matrices .",
    "note that it is essential to couple the light degrees of freedom of both mesons in spinor space , because these degrees of freedom determine the quantum number @xmath36 .",
    "proceeding in a naive way by coupling light and static degrees of freedom in both @xmath0 mesons separately will not result in a well defined angular momentum @xmath36 and , therefore , will mix different @xmath3 sectors . to obtain @xmath37 , the flavors of the light quarks have to be chosen according to @xmath38 , while for @xmath39 three possibilities exist , @xmath40 . for a list of @xmath3 trial states and their quantum numbers",
    "i refer to @xcite , table  1 .",
    "i use @xmath41 gauge field configurations generated by the european twisted mass collaboration ( etmc ) .",
    "the fermion action is @xmath42 wilson twisted mass @xcite at maximal twist , where static - light mass differences are automatically @xmath43 improved @xcite .",
    "the gauge action is tree - level symanzik improved @xcite .",
    "i use gauge coupling @xmath44 and light quark mass @xmath45 corresponding to a lattice spacing @xmath46 and a pion mass @xmath47 @xcite . for details regarding these gauge field configurations",
    "i refer to @xcite .",
    "in twisted mass lattice qcd at finite lattice spacing su(2 ) isospin is explicitely broken to u(1 ) , i.e.  @xmath48 is still a quantum number , but @xmath49 is not .",
    "moreover , parity @xmath50 has to be replaced by twisted mass parity @xmath51 , which is parity combined with light flavor exchange .",
    "the consequence is that there are only half as many @xmath3 sectors in twisted mass lattice qcd as there are in qcd , i.e.  qcd @xmath3 sectors are pairwise combined .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to unambiguously interpret states obtained from twisted mass correlation functions in terms of qcd quantum numbers .",
    "the method has successfully been applied in the context of static - light mesons @xcite and is explained in detail for kaons and @xmath52 mesons in @xcite . for a more elaborate discussion of twisted mass symmetries in the context of @xmath3 systems",
    "i refer to an upcoming publication @xcite .",
    "the potential of a pair of @xmath0 mesons is extracted from the exponential falloff of correlation functions of trial states ( [ eqn001 ] ) . as explained in subsection  [ sec002 ]",
    "the trial states differ by the spin coupling of the light quarks via the @xmath53 matrix @xmath34 ( @xmath54 possibilities ) and by their light quark flavor ( @xmath55 possibilities ) .",
    "consequently , there are @xmath56 different correlation functions .",
    "this number can also be understood from the point of view of individual @xmath0 mesons : since each of the two @xmath0 mesons has @xmath57 possibilities regarding quantum numbers ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , there should be @xmath58 @xmath3 correlation functions .",
    "as outlined in subsection  [ sec002 ] the @xmath3 trial states ( [ eqn001 ] ) can be classified according to @xmath3 quantum numbers . however , to interpret the @xmath3 potential obtained from the correlation function of a specific trial state ( [ eqn001 ] ) , it is also useful to express this trial state in terms of individual @xmath0 mesons , e.g.   + @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 + @xmath62 @xmath60 @xmath63 , + where @xmath1 and @xmath64 denote creation operators for @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons , respectively , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 indicate the orientation of the light quark spin .",
    "after linearly combining the two trial states via @xmath67 to eliminate the @xmath68 contributions , one can extract an @xmath69 potential with quantum numbers @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , one can estimate a @xmath68 potential with the same quantum numbers by choosing @xmath71 .",
    "results are shown in figure  [ fig001](a ) .",
    "further examples are discussed in @xcite .",
    "@xmath3 potentials as functions of the meson separation .",
    "( a )  @xmath69 potential and @xmath68 potential both with quantum numbers @xmath70 .",
    "( b ) ,  ( c ) ,  ( d )  attractive @xmath69 singlet , isospin triplet and isospin / spin sextet . ]",
    "@xmath3 potentials mainly differ in their asymptotic value at large meson separations , which is approximately @xmath72 , @xmath73 or @xmath74 for @xmath69 , @xmath75 or @xmath68 combinations , respectively , and whether they are attractive or repulsive at small meson separations .",
    "some of the potentials , even though they differ in their quantum numbers , are exactly degenerate due to isospin symmetry ( @xmath39 triplets ) or rotational symmetry around the @xmath6-axis ( @xmath76 doublets ) . in summary",
    "the number of attractive and repulsive @xmath3 potentials for @xmath69 , @xmath75 and @xmath68 combinations and their degeneracies are as follows : +    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      + consequently , from the @xmath77 trial states ( [ eqn001 ] ) one can extract @xmath78 different potentials .    of particular interest ,",
    "when asking , whether two @xmath0 mesons may form a bound tetraquark state , are attractive @xmath69 potentials .",
    "as stated above there are three different possibilities , a singlet , an isospin triplet and an isospin / spin sextet .",
    "the three potentials are shown in figure  [ fig001](b ) to [ fig001](d ) .",
    "while the triplet and the sextet are rather similar , the singlet is significantly different : it is deeper and wider and , therefore , probably the best candidate to start investigations , whether there are bound @xmath3 tetraquark states .",
    "such phenomenological investigations will be part of a subsequent publication .",
    "i have presented selected results of a first principles lattice computation of @xmath3 potentials .",
    "various channels characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath79 have been investigated . compared to existing publications the computations have been performed with rather light dynamical quark mass ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the results have been interpreted in terms of individual @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "future plans include studying the light quark mass dependence , the continuum limit as well as finite volume effects . moreover , also @xmath81 and @xmath82 potentials could be computed . to treat the @xmath83 quark as a fully dynamical quark",
    ", such computations should be performed on @xmath84 flavor gauge field configurations currently generated by etmc @xcite .",
    "finally , one should use the obtained @xmath3 potentials as input for phenomenological considerations to answer e.g.  the question , whether two @xmath0 mesons are able to form a bound tetraquark state .",
