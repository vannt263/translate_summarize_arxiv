    "the gated lateral semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) in a quantum well ( qw ) , in which the growth direction ( @xmath0 direction , or vertical direction ) confinement is due to the higher bandgap of the barrier material @xcite , have been proposed for use as quantum bits ( qubits ) in quantum computer architecture several times .",
    "decoherence due to single electron confinement within a coupled qds structure , which plays the role of qubits ( qbs ) , has two important channels .",
    "the first channel is the coulomb interaction to the background charge fluctuation and the second is the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "furthermore , physical properties of semiconductor - based qbs relevant to single electron spin and charge degree of freedom have been a subject of theoretical studies.@xcite notice that for charge qubits there is only a single electron in a double dot , in contrast with spin qubits , where each quantum dot has one electron and the double dot is only for two - qubit operations.@xcite    the effects of charge decoherence due to electron - phonon interactions are of crucial importance in semiconductor - based quantum computer architecture . in our recent work,@xcite",
    "we have shown that the scattering rates due to electron - acoustical phonon interactions and the dephasing rates due to the coupling of electrons to acoustical and optical phonons strongly depend on the interdot distance and the strength of the electron confinement .",
    "the multiphonon processes @xcite among other scattering mechanisms ( e.g. one phonon process , electron - electron , spin - phonon interactions etc ) can describe and measure the decoherence in qds .",
    "earlier theoretical work , in multiphonon processes in single three dimensional qd made with gaas in which the electron confinement potential is assumed to be isotropic and parabolic , was reported two decades ago.@xcite in their theoretical work , they used a few possible processes using longitudinal acoustical ( la ) and longitudinal optical phonons ( lo ) which were mainly described by bulk phonon approximation.@xcite this theory serves laser nanotechnology interests and handles the photoluminescence degradation in small qds . according to the best knowledge of the authors , the relaxation rates ( source of charge decoherence in qubits and in optoelectronic devices ) due to multiphonon processes in laterally coupled qds in the presence of an external magnetic field and for a range of operating temperature",
    "have not been reported .    in this paper ,",
    "our study related to two phonon processes in coupled qds under the existence of an external magnetic field and their role in charge decoherence is presented .",
    "starting with section ii , we firstly give a theoretical motivation of the electron wavefunctions and phonon model which describes the deformation and piezoelectric types of electron - phonon interactions .",
    "secondly , we present the equation of electron scattering rates due to the second order perturbation term which describes the two - phonon processes . in section iii , we show the relaxation rates due to two - phonon processes and we discuss their dependence on several configurations .",
    "lastly , section iv , presents a summary of our results and future implementations .",
    "we consider a heterostructure composed of two laterally coupled qds . in order to calculate the electron states within the coupled system",
    ", we have used a one - band effective mass approximation .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the single - electron motion @xcite which is confined in laterally coupled qds is given by @xmath1 where the lateral motion of electron is decoupled from the one along the quantum well growth ( z - axis)@xcite .",
    "the external magnetic field is applied along the z - axis @xmath2 , and as a result the magnetic vector potential @xmath3 could be given as @xmath4 the hamiltonian operators for the lateral directions and z - direction have been considered as @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the operator of the @xmath0 component of the angular momentum , @xmath8 is the electron effective mass , @xmath9 is the offset between the band edges of the gaas well and the algaas barrier , @xmath10 is the heaviside step function , @xmath11 is the quantum mechanical operator of momentum , @xmath12 is a parameter describing the strength of the confinement in x - y plane , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) , electron wavefunction can be given by the following envelope function , @xmath15 in our investigation , we have only considered the ground state wavefunction along the qw growth and the wavefunction along the lateral direction is given by fock - darwin states .",
    "following the same procedure as , we have considered that the external confining potential for the electron within two qds structure is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the separation distance of the dots .",
    "the electron wavefunction of the coupled qd structure could be described by @xmath18 where the single electron wavefunction for the parallel plane is given by : @xmath19 a numerical scheme has been employed in order to calculate the total wavefunction in the parallel plane of the coupled dot system . in low dimensional structures ,",
    "the electrons interact with acoustical and optical phonons .",
    "the optical phonons do not have any contribution to electron scattering rates due to the small electron energy splitting .",
    "therefore , only the acoustical phonons contribute to the relaxation rates . in this work ,",
    "we calculate the electron scattering rate which is caused due to deformation potential and piezoelectric acoustic phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes these interactions is given by : @xmath20 the term @xmath21 , which includes both the deformation and the piezoelectric interaction for zincblende crystals , is defined by @xmath22 with @xmath23 in eqs .",
    "( [ phonons1]-[pz ] ) , @xmath24 is the mass density of the host material , @xmath25 is the frequency of the phonon mode with wavevector @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the volume of the sample , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are phonon annihilation and creation operators , @xmath30 is the electron density operator , @xmath31 denotes the deformation potential , @xmath32 is the piezoelectric constant and @xmath33 is the polarization vector .",
    "all values of the above mentioned parameters used in our calculations have been taken from ref . .",
    "the last part of our theoretical formalism is the calculation of the electron scattering rates due to two - phonon processes . considering only la phonons , the scattering rates ( second order perturbation theory )",
    "are given by the following equations @xmath34",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 where the indices @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 represent the emission of two phonons ( la+la ) , the absorption of two phonons(-la - la ) and the emission of one phonon and absorption of one phonon ( la - la or -la+la ) respectively .",
    "@xmath40 stands for the electron - phonon matrix elements where the index i ( f ) corresponds to qubit electron first excited state ( ground state ) and s stands for the intermediate electronic states .",
    "the other elements are taken by changing the proper suffixes .",
    "@xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the bose distribution function referring to phonons with energy @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that the summation over s excludes the initial and final states .",
    "the integrals which are included in eqs .",
    "( [ fermi1]-[fermi3 ] ) by transforming the summations to integrations , have been calculated by monte carlo code .",
    "fig . [ fig_0_two_phonons ] shows all possible scattering processes concerning the electron transitions due to second order contributions associated to acoustic phonons .",
    "the transitions described by eqs .",
    "( [ fermi1 ] ) and ( [ fermi3 ] ) are presented in fig .",

    "[ fig_0_two_phonons]-iii ( fig .",

    "it is worth mentioning that eq .",

    "[ fermi1]-  [ fermi3 ] ) , we estimate the relaxation rates for an electron which relaxes to ground state via the two phonon processes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , we present the relaxation rates for the case of the emission of a la phonon and the absorption of a la phonon ( la - la ) , as a function of an external magnetic field . increasing the magnetic field in the range of 0 - 12 t , the electron wavefunctions get the largest value ( resonance value ) at b  3.7 t and as a result the matrix elements involved in the two - phonon scattering process increase . furthermore , the increasing number of phonon modes ( for b = 0 - 4 t ) that can be involved in the relaxation process , increases the scattering rates . for larger values of the magnetic field",
    "( b = 4 - 12 t ) the rates decrease due to the fact that the electron wavefunctions move away from the resonance value and due to the decreasing number of phonon density of phonons @xcite .",
    "the dependence of matrix elements on wavevector is related to @xmath45 for the deformation potential , while for the piezoelectric coupling it is related to @xmath46 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that although we have included both deformation and piezoelectric interactions in our phonon description , it is impossible to separate their contribution to the electron relaxation rates though two - phonon processes because of the dependence of matrix elements on the interaction strength ( eq.[phonons2 ] ) .    the dependence of the electron scattering rates on the half of the interdot separation distance for a range of magnetic field values is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath47 the rates have the largest value because the electron - phonon matrix elements get the highest value at magnetic field @xmath48 .",
    "increasing the interdot distance , the rates emerge peaks due to the increasing number of phonon density of phonons and due to the matrix elements enhancement . for large interdot distance , the scattering rates decrease because of the decreasing number of phonon modes that can be involved in the scattering rates .",
    "[ fig_4 ] shows the calculated relaxation rates as a function of the lattice temperature for all possible two phonon processes for a non zero applied external magnetic field .",
    "the first feature is that there are crossovers between the rates of different phonon processes due to different phonon population factors related to bose distribution function ( see eqs .",
    "( [ fermi1]-[fermi3 ] ) ) .",
    "secondly , the rates increase rapidly by increasing the lattice temperature from low temperatures - which are generally the operating temperature of the devices made with low dimensional structures - up to @xmath49 .",
    "the rise of the rates reaches almost 8 order of magnitude difference ( -la+la ) for the examined edges of temperature interval .",
    "this type of behavior is because of differing phonon population factors as the lattice temperature increases .",
    "lastly , at room temperature the processes + la+la and -la - la have almost the same scattering rates due to the same phonon distribution .",
    "the same feature also exists for the rates corresponding to the + la - la and -la+la processes for very large temperature .",
    "we have researched the decoherence channel due to electron - phonon interaction by studying the two - phonon processes on gated lateral semiconductor qds .",
    "we have studied the electron coupling to acoustical phonons through a deformation potential and piezoelectric interaction and found a strong dependence of relaxation rates on the external magnetic field , the separation distance and the lattice temperature .",
    "although the electron relaxation rates can have very tiny values for the @xmath50 range , the increase of temperature can increase the rates to large values .",
    "lastly , according to the best of the authors knowledge , such experiments related to charge decoherence for our geometric configuration in the presence of an external magnetic field and large operating temperature have not been reported in order to compare them with our theoretical results .",
