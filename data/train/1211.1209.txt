    "the recent interest in models of quantum engines and refrigerators stimulates theoretical efforts to precisely formulate fundamental thermodynamical principles and bounds valid on the micro- and nano - scale . in principle",
    "these can differ from the standard ones and converge to them only in the limit of macroscopic systems .",
    "a sample of references , including both general considerations and particular models , is given in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is about the amount of work that can be extracted from a small quantum mechanical system that is used to store temporarily energy to transfer it from a production to a consumption center .",
    "to do so we are not coupling such a quantum battery to external thermal baths in order to drive thermodynamical engines but we address it by controlling its dynamics by external time - dependent fields .",
    "the battery comes with its initial state @xmath0 and own internal hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the idealized process of reversible energy extraction is then governed by the system dynamics plus some fields that are only turned on during a certain interval @xmath2 $ ] of time .",
    "this leads to a time - dependent unitary dynamics of the battery .",
    "we now wonder about the maximal amount of work that can be extracted by such a process .    it has been known for a long time that some states ca nt deliver work in this way .",
    "such states are called passive @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the maximal amount of work extractable from a battery is then the surplus energy of the initial state with respect to the passive state @xmath3 with the same eigenvalues as @xmath0 .    as we are dealing with small quantum systems we may wonder whether using processes that entangle two identical copies of a given battery can yield a higher energy extraction . more generally , what happens to a large number of copies ?",
    "we numerically demonstrate that the efficiency of energy extraction grows with the number of copies .",
    "next we show rigorously that the maximal amount of extractable energy per battery asymptotically equals the energy difference between the initial state @xmath0 of the battery and the energy of the gibbs state @xmath4 with the same entropy as @xmath0 .",
    "we indicate how to construct in principle a unitary that achieves this optimal bound .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath5 of wave functions of the battery is for simplicity chosen to be @xmath6-dimensional and we pick as standard basis for @xmath5 the eigenvectors of the system hamiltonian @xmath7 we assume here that the energy levels are non - degenerate which holds for a generic hamiltonian .",
    "the time - dependent fields that will be used to extract energy from the battery are described by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is possibly only different from zero for @xmath10 .",
    "the initial state of the battery is described by a density matrix @xmath0 and the time evolution of @xmath0 is obtained from the liouville - von  neumann equation @xmath11,\\enskip \\rho(0 ) = \\rho.\\ ] ] the work extracted by this procedure is then @xmath12 where the state at time @xmath13 is related to the initial state @xmath0 by a unitary transformation @xmath14 with @xmath15 the time - ordered exponential of the total hamiltonian @xmath16 : @xmath17 note that by a proper choice of controlling term @xmath18 any unitary @xmath19 can be obtained for @xmath20 .",
    "therefore the maximal amount of extractable work ( called _ ergotropy _ in @xcite ) can be defined as @xmath21 where the minimum is taken over all unitary transformations of @xmath5 .",
    "following pusz and woronowicz  @xcite and lenard  @xcite , we call a state @xmath22 passive if no work can be extracted from @xmath22 , i.e.  if for all unitaries @xmath19 @xmath23 the following theorem then holds :    @xmath22 is passive if and only if @xmath24    in other words , @xmath22 is passive if and only if it commutes with the system hamiltonian and its eigenvalues are non - increasing with the energy .",
    "given @xmath0 there is a unique passive state @xmath3 minimizing @xmath25 .",
    "this state is obtained by a unitary rotation of @xmath0 denoted by @xmath26 and has the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the eigenvalues of @xmath0 arranged in non - increasing order : @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding minimal energy is @xmath30 and the maximal amount of extractable work is given by @xmath31",
    "we obtain here a bound on @xmath32 by comparing the energies of the passive state @xmath3 and of the canonical gibbs state @xmath4 with the same entropy as @xmath0 .",
    "recall that the canonical gibbs state at inverse temperature @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 and that its von  neumann entropy is strictly monotonically decreasing in @xmath33 with range @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "the von  neumann entropy @xmath36 of a density matrix @xmath0 is @xmath37 for any given density matrix @xmath0 on @xmath5 there exists therefore a unique inverse temperature @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath38 is , of course , highly non - linear .",
    "we now use the variational principle of statistical mechanics that asserts that the gibbs canonical density matrix is that which minimizes the free energy : @xmath40 with our choice of @xmath38 we obtain that @xmath41 and hence the thermodynamical bound on the available work @xmath42 generally , @xmath4 is different from @xmath3 as @xmath4 and @xmath3 or @xmath0 have different eigenvalues . note , however , that the two - dimensional case is exceptional because there is a one - to - one correspondence between the entropy of a qubit state and its ordered eigenvalues . generally it is not true that a product of two independent copies of a passive state still is passive .",
    "there is therefore a possibility of improving over  ( [ wmax ] ) on the amount of extractable work per copy for several copies of a system .",
    "in other words , by using entangling unitaries , one can in principle beat  ( [ wmax ] ) .    in fig.1 the energies",
    "@xmath43 per copy of the passive state @xmath44 obtained from a product state @xmath45 are plotted as dots for @xmath46 .",
    "the lower line shows the asymptotic value of @xmath43 .",
    "the system is a three level battery with energy levels @xmath47 and the passive state corresponding to the initial density matrix has eigenvalues @xmath48 .",
    "the values @xmath43 have been obtained by rearranging the eigenvalues of @xmath45 and the @xmath49-copy hamiltonian @xmath50 , see  ( [ hamn ] ) .",
    "the maximal additional work that can be extracted on top of the single copy extractable work using entangling unitaries is the difference between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we will compute this value in the next section .",
    "a state @xmath22 is called completely passive if @xmath53 is passive for all @xmath54 with respect to the sum hamiltonian @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the @xmath57-th independent copy of @xmath1 .",
    "thermodynamic equilibrium is equivalent to complete passivity :    @xmath22 is completely passive if and only if it is a gibbs state .",
    "we now consider @xmath49 independent copies of our battery and apply the general bound  ( [ bound ] ) to estimate the maximal amount of available work per battery @xmath58 it is our aim to show that this bound is actually asymptotically achievable :    @xmath59    the proof is based on the idea of typical configurations .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is diagonal in the eigenbasis of @xmath1 , this can always be achieved by a suitable unitary rotation and let @xmath28 be the eigenvalues of @xmath0 arranged in non - decreasing order .",
    "a configuration of length @xmath49 is an @xmath49-tuple @xmath60 of indices in @xmath61 with corresponding eigenvalue @xmath62 of @xmath45 .",
    "typical configurations will be of the type @xmath63 where the number of times the index @xmath64 occurs lies between @xmath65 and @xmath66 for every @xmath67 .",
    "the subspace spanned by these typical @xmath63 has approximately dimension @xmath68 and each such configuration corresponds to the average energy @xmath69    now we repeat the same construction for the product of @xmath49 copies of the gibbs state @xmath4 . as @xmath70 ,",
    "the typical subspaces of @xmath45 and @xmath71 have approximately the same dimension .",
    "moreover , for both product states the probability of finding a system outside the typical subspaces is @xmath72 .",
    "we can now find a unitary @xmath73 on @xmath74 that maps one subspace into the other .",
    "this unitary is highly non - unique , and generally differs from the optimal reordering given by @xmath75 but nevertheless produces the state with the energy close to the optimal one , i.e. @xmath76 using we obtain @xmath77 which combined with   yields the final estimation @xmath78    remark that a unitary transforming @xmath45 into @xmath44 can not be product and must therefore dynamically entangle the @xmath49 batteries . in the numerical example of fig .  1",
    "the asymptotic value @xmath52 exactly coincides with @xmath4 .",
    "the notion of maximal reversibly extractable work for a quantum battery motivated by the concept of passivity is discussed .",
    "it is applicable to full quantum models of micro- or mesoscopic machines where work is supplied or extracted by a quantum system ( ` quantum battery ' , ` work reservoir ' ) instead of a time - dependent perturbation of the hamiltonian .",
    "a proper definition of work is important to develop a consistent thermodynamics of small quantum systems which is relevant in nanotechnology and biophysics .",
    "generally , the extractable work is smaller than the thermodynamical bound computed using variational principle for a free energy . using entanglement one can in general extract more work per battery from several independent copies of a battery and asymptotically reach the thermodynamical bound .",
    "however , the optimal procedures of work extraction are generally difficult to implement by realistic control hamiltonians .",
    "an interesting problem for future investigation is to find efficiency bounds when practical restrictions are imposed on the available control mechanisms .",
