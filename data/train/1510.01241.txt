    "the dimensionless amplitude of the kicking potential , @xmath7 , namely the so - called classical stochastic parameter , governs the degree of the system s nonlinearity . despite this seemingly simple construction , tuning @xmath8 gives rise to rich dynamical behaviors .",
    "for example , for ( generic ) irrational values of @xmath9 the rotor s kinetic energy saturates at long times  @xcite , in sharp contrast to the linear energy growth in the classical limit of vanishing",
    "@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the former , the so - called dynamical localization , simulates an anderson insulator @xcite while the latter simulates a ( normal ) metal .",
    "even more striking , @xmath8-driven phenomena occur to variants of the kicked rotor and they simulate a broad spectrum of condensed - matter systems ( e.g. , refs .",
    "most recently , it has been found that for a spinful quasiperiodically kicked rotor , the planck s quantum can drive a sequential rotor anderson insulator - metal transition shown to be the mathematical equivalence of the integer quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "a peculiar phenomenon common to various kicked rotor systems is the so - called quantum resonance for rational values of @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being coprime natural numbers  @xcite .",
    "for these values of @xmath8 the rotor s kinetic energy grows quadratically at large times , which is much faster than the metallic ( linear ) growth .",
    "such a phase simulates a perfect crystal with diverging electric conductivity corresponding to ballistic electron motion .",
    "therefore , it is dubbed `` supermetal '' .",
    "physically , for rational @xmath9 the system exhibits translation symmetry in the angular momentum space , and resonant transmission through the ensuing bloch bands gives rise to the supermetallic ( quadratic ) growth .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of the system s behavior such as dynamical localization and quantum resonance to the number - theoretic property of @xmath9 is a prominent feature that distinguishes the kicked rotor from genuine disordered systems ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews of the early and recent status of this subject ) . over decades",
    ", this subject has been central to theoretical and experimental studies of quantum chaos .",
    "recently , the supermetallic phase of the kicked rotor has been experimentally observed in chemical systems and finds potential applications such as achieving spin - selective rotational excitation of molecules  @xcite .",
    "so far , most studies have focused on the asymptotic supermetallic growth and are mute to effects of chaoticity . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is first found by using the field theory that for the standard kicked rotor the chaoticity gives rise to a universal crossover from metallic to supermetallic energy growth which is insensitive to the system s details such as the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the strength of the kicking potential .",
    "moreover , it has been found that this universal dynamical behavior has a deep connection to the optical conductivity of perfect crystals  @xcite and the quantum walk in the periodic multi - baker map  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental question naturally arises : how robust is this dynamical behavior ?",
    "notably , it is unclear whether such dynamics universality exists in general periodic chaotic systems and is impervious to the symmetry .",
    "the present work aims at a systematic study of these issues .",
    "we study the supermetallic phase ( rational @xmath9 ) of a large class of generalized kicked rotor systems .",
    "these systems have qualitatively different dynamical behaviors ( e.g. , dynamical localization or delocalization ) when @xmath9 is irrational .",
    "we analytically show and numerically confirm that chaoticity leads to even richer universal behavior in the crossover from metallic to supermetallic energy growth .",
    "we find that the universal dynamics crossover behavior is very sensitive to the symmetry of the hamiltonian describing the free rotation of the particle , but not to system s details .",
    "we show that the universal metal - supermetal dynamics crossover can be attributed to the universality of fluctuations of the bloch wave functions and bands of the reduced quantum system in a unit cell .",
    "the latter motivates us to conjecture that the universality class of supermetal dynamics is identical to that of eigenfunction and spectral fluctuations described by the random matrix theory ( rmt )  @xcite .",

    "we show by the rmt that these universal dynamics crossovers can be attributed to the universal bloch wave functions and band fluctuations of quantum systems reduced to a unit cell .",
