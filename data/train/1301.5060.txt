    "the nature and origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) with energy above @xmath0 ev are outstanding problems of modern physics .",
    "many studies have been performed to unravel the problems : where do uhecrs come from , what is the composition of uhecrs , and how are uhecrs accelerated to such extreme energies ?",
    "uhecrs are believed to be the result of extremely powerful cosmic phenomena @xcite ; the most powerful astrophysical events , such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , and shock waves around clusters of galaxies @xcite , have been suggested as possible sources of uhecrs . yet , the nature and origin of uhecrs remain unsolved ( see @xcite for review ) .    cosmic rays",
    "( crs ) , which are electrically charged particles , do not travel in straight lines in space .",
    "their trajectories are bent by intergalactic and interstellar magnetic fields that are known to exist between galaxies and between stars @xcite .",
    "for this reason , even though we may guess their arrival directions at the earth , we do not know exactly where they come from .",
    "however , this problem may be resolved if enough events of uhecrs are observed .    directly detecting uhecrs at the top of the earth s atmosphere",
    "is practically impossible owing to the rarity of uhecr events . on average ,",
    "only a few particles hit a square kilometer of the atmosphere per century .",
    "such low flux of uhecrs demands experiments covering huge areas to increase opportunities for their detection . in the last few decades ,",
    "uhecrs have been observed by akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) @xcite , high resolution fly s eye experiment ( hires ) @xcite , pierre auger observatory ( auger ) @xcite , telescope array ( ta ) @xcite and so on .",
    "these experiments detect extensive air showers ( eass ) created by uhecrs .",
    "when uhecrs enter the earth s atmosphere , they first collide with air molecules of oxygen or nitrogen ; subsequently through complex interactions and cascades , eass , which are made of up to hundreds of billions of secondary particles ( see table 1 for the case of @xmath1ev primary ) , are generated @xcite . by detecting the photons produced by secondary particles and/or the secondary particles arriving at the ground ,",
    "the properties of primary particles such as the energy , arrival direction , and composition are inferred .    to observe uhecrs",
    ", agasa used a ground array of scintillation detectors , hires used fluorescence telescopes , auger uses a hybrid facility of water cherenkov tanks and fluorescence telescopes , and ta also uses a hybrid facility of scintillation detectors and fluorescence telescopes .",
    "fluorescence telescopes measure the ultra - violet ( uv ) fluorescence light produced through interactions between air molecules and secondary particles in eass , and arrays of scintillation detectors and water cherenkov tanks recode the secondary particles arriving at the ground . from these , agasa reported 58 events above 40 eev @xcite .",
    "hires observed 13 events above 56 eev @xcite .",
    "auger and ta have so far reported 69 events @xcite and 15 events @xcite above 55 eev and 57 eev , respectively .    along with observations of uhecrs ,",
    "eass need to be investigated by performing monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "eas simulations form an essential part of uhecr experiments .",
    "the ta experiment employs two existing mc codes for the simulations , corsika ( cosmic ray simulations for kascade ) @xcite and cosmos @xcite . in this paper , we report a comparison study of corsika and cosmos simulations for ta , presenting the longitudinal distribution of particle , depth of shower maximum , kinetic energy distribution of particle at the ground , and energy deposited to the air .",
    "we then discuss implications of our results to the ta experiment .",
    "corsika and cosmos follow the development and evolution of eass in the atmosphere ; they describe the spatial , temporal , and energy distributions of secondary particles . to compare corsika and cosmos , we generated 50 eas simulations with corsika for each set of parameters ( see below ) and another 50 eas simulations with cosmos for each set of parameters .",
    "primary energies of @xmath2 = 10@xmath3ev , 10@xmath4ev , 10@xmath5ev , 10@xmath6ev , 10@xmath7ev , 10@xmath8ev and 10@xmath9ev were considered . and zenith angles of @xmath10 = 0@xmath11 , 18.2@xmath11 , 25.8@xmath11 , 31.75@xmath11",
    ", 45@xmath11 , 70@xmath11 for proton and iron primaries were employed assuming the fat earth .",
    "all together about 8,400 eass were generated .",
    "events with @xmath12 45@xmath11 have been analyzed in the ta experiment @xcite , so we focus on the cases with @xmath12 45@xmath11 .",
    "simulations with @xmath10 = 70@xmath11 are used to estimate the energy deposited into the air in section 3.4 .",
    "version 6.960 was used for corsika simulations with @xmath10 = 0@xmath11 , 18.2@xmath11 , 25.8@xmath11 , 31.75@xmath11 , and 45@xmath11 , and version 6.980 was used for @xmath10 = 70@xmath11 . in cosmos , for @xmath10 = 0@xmath11 , 18.2@xmath11 , 25.8@xmath11 , 31.75@xmath11 , and 45@xmath11 , 30 simulations were generated with version 7.54 and 20 simulations with version 7.581 ; the difference between versions 7.54 and 7.581 is small , so they were mixed . for @xmath10 = 70@xmath11 , version 7.581 was used .      for high - energy ( @xmath13 gev ) ,",
    "the hadronic interaction generator qgsjetii-03 @xcite was used for both corsika and cosmos .",
    "qgsjetii-03 is one of most widely used interaction generators for uhecr eas simulations .    for low - energy ( @xmath14 gev ) , the hadronic interaction generator corsika - fluka @xcite was used in corsika , while the bertini and jqmd interaction models included in the phits code ( @xmath15 gev ) @xcite and jam ( v1.150 ) ( 2 gev @xmath16 80 gev ) @xcite were used in cosmos .",
    "we simply use the term `` phits '' for the two generators and the nelst routine managing the elastic scattering .    in corsika ,",
    "the interactions of electro - magnetic ( em ) particles ( i.e. , photons and electrons ) were calculated with the egs4 model @xcite . on the other hand , in cosmos , the interactions were calculated with the tsai s formula @xcite and nelson s formula @xcite which are based on the basic cross - sections of particles .",
    "we employed the following simulation parameters , trying to compare corsika and cosmos simulations in parallel .",
    "first , in both corsika and cosmos , the earth s magnetic field at the ta observation site ( 39.1@xmath11 n and 112.9@xmath11 w , just west of delta , utah ) was used .",
    "the ground was fixed at the height of the ta site , 1430 m above the sea level , corresponding to the vertical atmospheric depth @xmath17 g/@xmath18 .",
    "second , in both corsika and cosmos , the same threshold energies , @xmath19 , were applied to secondary particles .",
    "particles having energy below @xmath19 were not tracked in simulations .",
    "@xmath19 = 500 kev was used for em particles , while @xmath19 = 50 mev for muons and hadrons .",
    "most particles reach the ground with energy larger than the @xmath19 ( see figures 4 and 5 for the case of iron primary with @xmath2 = 10@xmath7ev and @xmath10 = 0@xmath11 ) .",
    "third , the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite is included in both corsika and cosmos .",
    "the lpm effect causes a reduction of bremsstrahlung and pair production cross sections at high energies .    in principle",
    ", all secondary particles can be tracked along their trajectories and their physical properties can be stored until they reach the ground .",
    "then , the number of particles can become too large to be comfortably accommodated with available computational resources . to alleviate this problem",
    ", most eas simulations introduce the hillas thinning algorithm @xcite .",
    "the algorithm picks up only a small fraction for secondary particles with energy smaller than the product of the primary energy ( @xmath2 ) and a thinning level ( @xmath20 , i.e. , for particles with @xmath21 . at each vertex of interaction , one secondary particle",
    "is selected in a way that more energetic particles are picked up with higher probabilities , and further tracked .",
    "a weight , which is defined as the ratio of the energy of the selected particle to that of all secondary particles at the vertex , is assigned to the selected particle to represent untracked particles .",
    "eventually , the total number of secondary particles are recovered by counting tracked particles multiplied by their weights @xcite .    in corsika",
    ", it is recommended to take a value between @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "we chose @xmath25 . on the other hand , in cosmos ,",
    "it is recommended to use @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the mass number .",
    "hence , for proton primary , @xmath28 was used for both corsika and cosmos ; for iron primary , @xmath28 and @xmath29 were used for corsika and cosmos , respectively .",
    "in addition , cosmos applies a smaller thinning , @xmath30 , where a higher accuracy is required . at the upper atmosphere of @xmath31 g/@xmath18 or near the shower core of @xmath32 m ,",
    "@xmath24 is used , while @xmath33 is applied to the region of @xmath34 g/@xmath18 and @xmath35 m.    corsika and cosmos both have an upper limit on the weight , the so - called maximum weight value , @xmath36 . as an eas develops , through interactions of particles , weights of tracked particles",
    "are continuously accumulated . when accumulated weights reach @xmath36 ,",
    "the thinning algorithm is no longer applied , and particles are tracked without further thinning .",
    "we used @xmath36 which is differently for corsika and cosmos : @xmath37 /10^{9})$ ] for corsika @xcite and @xmath38/10^{15}$ ] for cosmos @xcite .    with our choices of thinning and weighting ,",
    "overall more particles are tracked in cosmos than in corsika .",
    "the computation time is roughly proportional to the number of tracked particles , so for the same primary cosmos simulations presented here took longer than corsika simulations .",
    "we also note that the data dumping is different between corsika and cosmos . in corsika ,",
    "the grid points of the vertical atmospheric depth have a spacing of @xmath39 1 g/@xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , in cosmos , the grid points are defined at @xmath40 , 100 , 200 g/@xmath18 , and after @xmath41 g/@xmath18 they have a spacing of @xmath39 25 g/@xmath18 .",
    "so the data from corsika simulations are dumped in every @xmath39 1 g/@xmath18 , while the data from cosmos are dumped in every @xmath39 100 g/@xmath18 for @xmath42 200 g/@xmath18 and in every @xmath39 25 g/@xmath18 for @xmath43 200 g/@xmath18 .",
    "when uhecrs strike the atmosphere , most of the particles initially generated are neutral and charged - pions .",
    "neutral - pions quickly decay into two photons .",
    "charged - pions ( positively or negatively charged ) survive longer , and either collide with other particles or decay to muons and muon neutrinos .",
    "those particles produce the so - called em and hadronic showers . in em showers , photons create electrons and positrons by pair - production , and in turn electrons and positrons create photons via bremsstrahlung , and so on .",
    "em showers continue until the average energy per particle drops to @xmath44 mev . below this energy ,",
    "the dominant energy loss mechanism is ionization rather than bremsstrahlung .",
    "then , em particles are not efficiently produced anymore , and eass reach the maximum ( see the next subsection ) . in hadronic showers , muons and hadrons are produced through hadronic interactions and decays . here , hadrons include nucleons ( neutrons and protons ) , pions , and kaons .",
    "the number of secondary particles created by em and hadronic showers initially increases and then decreases , as an eas develops through the atmosphere .",
    "the distribution of particles along the atmospheric depth is called the longitudinal distribution @xcite . here",
    ", we first compare the longitudinal distributions from corsika and cosmos simulations , and analyze the differences in photon , electron , muon , and hadron distributions .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the typical longitudinal distributions as a function of slant atmospheric depth , @xmath45 .",
    "lines represent the numbers of particles averaged for 50 eas simulations , @xmath46 , and error bars mark the standard deviations , @xmath47 , defined as @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the number of eas simulations for each set of parameters and @xmath50 is the number of particles at @xmath51 in each simulation .",
    "the eass shown are for proton and iron primaries , respectively , with @xmath2=10@xmath7 ev and @xmath10 = 0@xmath11 and 45@xmath11 .",
    "numbers for photons , electrons , muons , and hadrons are shown .",
    "table 1 shows the numbers of particles at peaks , which are again averages of 50 eas simulations .",
    "if the peaks are located beyond the maximum depth , the values at the maximum depth are shown .",
    "note that difference species have peaks at different @xmath51 s .    in the cases shown ,",
    "cosmos predicts slightly more particles in the early stage of eass ( except for photons in the upper - left panel of figure 1 ) , while corsika predicts slightly more particles in the late stage .",
    "but the difference is within the fluctuation ( that is , less than @xmath47 in equation ( 1 ) ) .",
    "quantitatively , the difference between corsika and cosmos results in the peak numbers of particles is at most @xmath52 , as shown in table 1 .",
    "the depth of shower maximum , denoted by @xmath53 , is defined as the slant atmospheric depth at which the number of secondary electrons reaches the maximum in eass .",
    "@xmath53 is a function of the primary energy , but it has different values and dispersions for different primary particles . for a given primary energy ,",
    "proton primary has larger values and dispersions of @xmath53 than iron primary .",
    "the average and standard deviation of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are known as the key quantities that discriminate the composition of primary particles in uhecr experiments .    in calculating @xmath53 ,",
    "the longitudinal distribution of electrons along the shower axis was fitted to the gaisser - hillas function ( ghf ) @xcite , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the maximum number of electrons at @xmath53 .",
    "we sought @xmath53 by treating @xmath58 and @xmath59 as well as @xmath53 and @xmath57 as fitting parameters .",
    "we note that originally @xmath58 was meant to be the depth at which the first interaction occurs and @xmath59 to be the proton interaction mean free path .",
    "but in practice , they were regarded as fitting parameters .",
    "it was shown that the resulting @xmath53 is not sensitive to whether @xmath59 is used as a free parameter or set to a fixed value @xcite .",
    "figure 3 and table 2 show @xmath54 and @xmath55 in our simulations for proton and iron primaries with different @xmath60 s . @xmath54 and",
    "@xmath55 in table 2 were calculated for 250 simulations including those of five different zenith angles ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "solid and dashed lines in figure 3 are the least chi - square fits of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in table 2 .",
    "the result of wahlberg et al . with corsika @xcite",
    "is included with dot - dashed lines for comparison .",
    "we note that in some simulations the shower maximum occurred beyond the maximum depth . in such cases ,",
    "@xmath53 s from fits to the ghf may have larger errors . and",
    "for corsika results , the data dumped in every @xmath39 1 g/@xmath18 were used , while for cosmos results , the data in every @xmath39 25 g/@xmath18 were used .",
    "so a larger systematic error may exist in cosmos results .",
    "the results for @xmath54 and @xmath55 in figure 3 and table 2 are summarized as follows .",
    "first , the difference between corsika and cosmos results in @xmath54 is at most @xmath62 g/@xmath18 for both proton and iron primaries . it is smaller than the fluctuation , @xmath55 .",
    "second , the difference between @xmath54 s for proton and iron primaries is typically @xmath63 g/@xmath18 , which is beyond the fluctuations both in corsika and cosmos simulations as well as the difference between corsika and cosmos results .",
    "third , @xmath55 is @xmath64 g/@xmath18 in for proton primary , while it is @xmath65 g/@xmath18 for iron primary .",
    "@xmath55 is somewhat larger in corsika than in cosmos , as is clear in figure 3 ; the difference is larger for proton primary .",
    "fourth , our corsika results agree with those of wahlberg et al . yet ours are smaller by up to @xmath66 g/@xmath18 .",
    "a number of possible causes can be conjectured .",
    "our simulations performed with versions , models , and parameters different from those of wahlberg et al . in our work @xmath54 is defined as the depth of the peak in the number of electrons above 500 kev , while in wahlberg et al .",
    "it was defined as the depth of the peak in overall energy deposit .",
    "also the error in the fitting could be in the level of @xmath66 g/@xmath18 .",
    "although not shown here , we found that @xmath54 for different zenith angles varies by up to @xmath66 g/@xmath18 .      in eass ,",
    "a fraction of secondary particles reach the ground .",
    "those particles deposit a part of their energy to ground detectors , such as scintillation detectors or water cherenkov tanks . in experiments , by measuring the amount and spatial distribution of the deposited energy , the primary energy and arrival direction of uhecrs are estimated @xcite . here",
    ", we present the kinetic energy ( i.e. , the total energy subtracted by the rest - mass energy ) distributions of secondary particles over the entire ground ; the amount of energy deposited to detectors is determined by the kinetic energy .",
    "figure 4 shows the typical kinetic energy distributions of photons , electrons , muons , and hadrons , including particles in the shower core ; here the eas is for iron primary with @xmath67 ev and @xmath68 .",
    "lines are the averages of 50 eas simulations , and error bars mark the standard deviations , @xmath47 , defined similarly as in equation ( 1 ) . tables 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 show the total kinetic energies ( @xmath69 ) and numbers ( @xmath70 ) of particles reaching the ground for each particle species .",
    "again , they are the averages of 50 eas simulations . to further analyze the kinetic energy distributions of different components , hadrons were separated into nucleons , pions , and kaons , and figure 5 shows their distributions .",
    "we first point that although @xmath71 for all the cases we simulated as shown in tables 5 and 6 , the energy partitioning depends on eas parameters and varies significantly as shown in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "for instance , in the eas of iron primary with @xmath72 ev and @xmath68 which is shown in figures 4 and 5 , the partitioning of the kinetic energies of particles reaching the ground is @xmath73 . on the other hand , in the eas of proton primary with @xmath74 ev and @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "we found that the difference between corsika and cosmos results in figures 4 and 5 is up to 30 @xmath77 , but yet the difference is within the fluctuation at most energy bins .",
    "tables 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 indicate differences of up to 30 @xmath77 in the integrated kinetic energies and numbers .",
    "there are following general tends : 1 ) for most cases , corsika predicts larger energies for photons and electrons , while cosmos predicts larger energies for muons .",
    "2 ) the difference is larger for proton primary than for iron primary .",
    "3 ) the difference is larger for larger @xmath60 and for larger @xmath10 .",
    "we note that larger numbers of particles do not necessarily mean larger energies ; this point is particularly clear for muons .",
    "interactions between air molecules and secondary particles yield uv fluorescence light , which is observed with fluorescence telescopes in uhecr experiments @xcite .",
    "the energy estimated through observation of uv fluorescence light is called the calorimetric energy , and it is used to infer the primary energy of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "the energy released as the fluorescence light is determined by the energy deposited to the air , @xmath78 .",
    "so in order for the primary energy to be accurately estimated in uhecr experiments , @xmath78 needs to be precisely known @xcite .",
    "we compare the energy deposited to the air due to em particles , muons , and hadrons in corsika and cosmos simulations .",
    "both corsika and cosmos follow @xmath78 by the particles with @xmath79 along the atmospheric depth in simulations . but the codes does not track particles and their contribution any more , if their energy drops below the threshold energy .",
    "so we compare @xmath78 by particles with @xmath79 .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath78 as a function of the slant atmospheric depth , @xmath51 , for proton primary with @xmath67 ev and @xmath68 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "lines are the averages of 50 eas simulations .",
    "table 7 shows the average of the fraction of the energy , @xmath83 , and the relative standard deviation , @xmath84/@xmath85 , for proton and iron primaries with different primary energies and @xmath86 at the ground ; for @xmath86 the slant atmospheric depth at the ground is large enough that @xmath78 has reached the maximum ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the values in table 7 were calculated with 50 eas simulations for each set of parameters .",
    "there is a clear trend in figure 6 that cosmos predicts larger @xmath87 than corsika .",
    "the energy deposited to the air by the particles with @xmath79 in table 7 is @xmath85/@xmath88 in corsika simulations , while @xmath85/@xmath89 in cosmos simulations .",
    "the difference is @xmath90 @xmath77 , which is larger than the fluctuation .",
    "the relative standard deviation , @xmath84/@xmath85 , is small and typically @xmath91 @xmath77 both in corsika and cosmos simulations .    for the total energy deposited to the air , the contribution due to the particles with @xmath92 , as well as that by the particles with @xmath79 , should be counted .",
    "yet , the difference of @xmath90 @xmath77 is substantial .",
    "it means that the uv fluorescence light assessed with corsika and cosmos simulations could differ by a similar amount , so does the primary energy of uhecr events estimated with corsika and cosmos simulations .",
    "eas simulations form an essential part of experiments to detect uhecrs ; they are used to estimate the energy , arrival direction , and composition of primary particles .",
    "the ta experiment employs two codes , corsika and cosmos , for the simulations . in this paper , we compared corsika and cosmos simulations by quantifying the differences in the longitudinal distribution of particles , depth of shower maximum , kinetic energy distribution of particle at the ground , and energy deposited to the air .",
    "most of all , we should point that the simulation results of corsika and cosmos agree well with each other , despite of all the complexities and differences in the models and elements involved in the codes .",
    "such agreement should be quite an achievement .",
    "nevertheless , there are non - negligible differences in the quantities we presented .",
    "those may be regarded as systematic uncertainties in the eas simulation part of uhecr experiments .",
    "\\1 ) the difference between corsika and cosmos results in the longitudinal distribution of particles is less than @xmath66 @xmath77 for most cases , which is within the fluctuation .",
    "the difference in the peak numbers of particles is at most @xmath93 @xmath77 ( table 1 ) .",
    "cosmos tends to predict slightly more particles in the early stage of eass , while corsika tends to predict slightly more particles in the late stage .",
    "\\2 ) corsika and cosmos predict the depths of shower maximum , @xmath54 , which are consistent with each other .",
    "the difference between @xmath54 s from corsika and cosmos is up to @xmath62 g/@xmath18 , which is noticeable but smaller than the fluctuation , @xmath55 .",
    "the difference between @xmath54 s for proton and iron primaries , which is typically @xmath63 g/@xmath18 , is beyond the fluctuations both in corsika and cosmos simulations as well as the difference between the corsika and cosmos results .",
    "@xmath55 is @xmath64 g/@xmath18 in for proton primary , while it is @xmath65 g/@xmath18 for iron primary .",
    "@xmath55 is somewhat larger in corsika than in cosmos ; the difference is larger for iron primary .",
    "\\3 ) there are differences of up to 30 @xmath77 between corsika and cosmos results in the numbers and energies of the particles reaching the ground ; the difference is larger for proton primary with larger @xmath60 s and larger @xmath10 s .",
    "it implies that the amount of the energy deposited to ground detectors could be different up to 30 @xmath77 or so in corsika and cosmos simulations . the exact response to the particles passing through ground detectors , however",
    ", depends on the details of detectors , and need simulations , for instance , with the geant code .",
    "we leave this issue for a follow - up study .",
    "\\4 ) the energy deposited to the air , @xmath78 , by the particles with @xmath79 is larger by @xmath90 @xmath77 in cosmos simulations than in corsika simulations .",
