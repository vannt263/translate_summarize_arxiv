    "the theoretical and computational modeling is becoming increasingly important in the development of advanced high performance materials for industrial applications .",
    "atomistic level understanding of the properties of fcc transition metals under various conditions is important in their technological applications .",
    "the behavior of pure silver , gold , copper , nickel , platinum , rhodium and their alloys are tested over a wide temperature range using the potentials developed by sutton and co - workers @xcite for simulation .",
    "our computer simulation results for pt - rh alloys are presented in elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the md algorithms that we use are based on the extended hamiltonian formalism and the ordinary experimental conditions are simulated using the constant - pressure , constant - temperature ( npt ) md method .",
    "computer simulations on various model systems usually use simple pair potentials . on many occasions to account for the directionality of bonding , three body interactions are also employed . the interactions in real crystalline materials can not be represented by simple pairwise interactions alone . pure pairwise potential model gives the cauchy relation between the elastic constants @xmath0,which is not the case in real metals .",
    "in these systems the electron density plays a dominant role in interactions and resulting physical properties .",
    "therefore , many - body interactions should be taken into consideration in any study of metals and metal alloys . in simple sp - bonded metals ,",
    "the interaction potentials may be derived from model pseudopotentials using the second order perturbation theory .",
    "we have developed interaction potentials along these lines , and utilized them to study the properties of simple alkali metal and alkali metal alloys in the past @xcite .",
    "however , for d - band metal and metal alloys the model pseudopotential approach should give way to newer techniques evolved over the past ten years to account for the many body effects . among these approaches , the empirical many body potentials based on norskov s effective medium theory @xcite , daw and baskes embedded atom method @xcite , finnis and sinclair s @xcite empirical many body potentials , and more recently the many body potentials developed by sutton and co - workers @xcite within the context of tight binding approach @xcite for fcc transition metals can be listed . due to its mathematically simple power law form and fairly long range character , in recent years",
    "the sutton - chen ( sc ) potential has been widely used in simulations to study a range of problems @xcite .",
    "in the sc description the total potential energy of the metal is given as a sum of a pairwise repulsion term and a many - body density dependent cohesion term .",
    "the cohesion term supplies the description of short - range interactions to obtain a good description of surface relaxation , and the pairwise term gives a correct description of long - range interactions with a van der waals tail .",
    "the functional form of the interaction potential is as follows : u_i = d(12 _ j u(*r_ij * ) - c _ i ) [ must24 ]  , where u ( r ) = ( a r ) ^n [ must25 ]  , + _",

    ". metals . in table:1 ,",
    "the values of these parameters for ni , cu , ag , au , pt and rh are listed .",
    "the functional form of the sutton - chen potential is fairly simple in comparison to embedded atom method potentials and is moderately long ranged .",
    "the last property makes this set especially attractive for surface and interface studies amongst others , since most of them are very short ranged ( are fitted up to first or second nearest neighbor distances).these interaction potentials can be generalized to describe binary metal alloys in such a way that all the parameters in the hamiltonian equations are obtained from the parameters of pure metals .",
    "the sutton - chen interaction potential above is adopted by rafii - tabar and sutton @xcite to a random f.c.c .",
    "alloy model in which sites are occupied by two types of atoms completely randomly , such that the alloy has the required average concentration .",
    "the equilibrium lattice parameter @xmath5 at 0 k of the random alloy is chosen as the universal length scale and the expectation value @xmath6 per atom of the interaction hamiltonian is given as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "rafii - tabar and sutton after determining the value of the equilibrium lattice parameter for the random alloy , they calculated elastic constants and enthalpy of mixing by _ static _ lattice summation method .",
    "once @xmath5 is found the enthalpy of mixing @xmath7 per atom at 0 k are also obtained from h= e^t - c_a e^a - c_b e^b [ must28 ]  , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the cohesive energies per atom of the elemental @xmath10 and @xmath11 metals and the constants are such that @xmath12",
    ".    in this paper we aim at using the molecular dynamics method to obtain the @xmath5 and the enthalpy of mixing per atom for alloys . in the following the expressions specific to many body potentials which are used in our computations",

    "the first term represents the contribution from the fluctuation of the microscopic stress tensor , p@xmath23 , the second term represents the kinetic energy contribution , and the third term is the born term .",
    "we use the program * simulator * developed by ain that employs the state of the art md algorithms based on extended hamiltonian formalisms emerging from the works of anderson @xcite , parinello and rahman @xcite , nos @xcite , hoover @xcite and ain @xcite . a 500 atoms cubical system is used and the simulation started with atoms randomly distributed on a fcc lattice.the system is thermalized starting from 1k to the target temperature using a constant enthalpy and constant pressure ( nhp ) ensemble by slowly heating while scaling velocities to increment the temperature of 1k / step over the specific number of steps depending on the target temperature .",

    "then , npt dynamics at this temperature for 20000 steps to calculate the volume , density and enthalpy of the system for each concentration is performed .",
    "the resulting zero strain averaged matrix @xmath24 is used in calculating elastic constants over 50000 steps of nve dynamics .",
    "a fifth - order gear predictor - corrector algorithm is used in @xmath25 t = 2 fs.the parrinello - rahman piston mass parameter is chosen as w=400 and in npt runs the nos - hoover parameter is set to q=100 .",
    "in this section , the molecular simulation results obtained for pure f.c.c .",
    "transition metals , ni , cu , ag , au , pt and rh are presented . in tables 2 to 7 , the results of npt molecular dynamics simulations of pure elements after 20000 steps are shown . these are density , enthalpy , potential energy and volume of 500 atoms calculated at different temperatures . in obtaining these values",
    "the system is thermalized starting from @xmath26k to the target temperature using 20000 steps nhp simulations .",
    "we then performed another 20000 steps npt dynamics at the target temperature . in order to show the behavior of sutton - chen potentials at elevated temperatures ; the results of density and enthalpy",
    "are plotted at temperatures @xmath27k , @xmath28k , @xmath29k and @xmath30k in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the extra datas for pt and rh at temperatures @xmath31k , @xmath32k , @xmath33k , @xmath34k and @xmath35k are coming from the calculations of pt - rh alloys @xcite . in tables 2 to 7 at @xmath27k , the experimental and simulation results of the densities are shown .",
    "simulation results show approximately 2.0@xmath36 deviation from the experimental values for ni , cu , ag , au and 1.4@xmath36 and 1.0@xmath36 for pt and rh respectively .",
    "the percent change in the lattice parameter at each temperature ( the lattice parameter at @xmath27k is used as the reference ) for ni , cu , ag , au are given in table 8 , pt and rh results are being discussed in @xcite . as a concluding remark",
    ", it can be said that as the temperature increases the deviation from the experimental values increases .    in tables",
    "9 to 14 , the results of the calculations of the elastic constants and bulk moduli of ni , cu , ag , au , pt and rh obtained from nve simulations of 50000 steps are presented .",
    "elastic constants are calculated in the temperature range between @xmath27k to @xmath30k . in the calculations at each concentration and at each temperature first the zero - strain state of the system is determined by performing constant - temperature and constant - stress simulations . in determining the elastic constants this reference state",
    "is used in constant - temperature , constant - volume simulations of 50000 steps for each state point .",
    "comparison with experimental results is possible only at @xmath37k and this is shown in table 15 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath38 is @xmath39 for ni , @xmath40 for cu , @xmath41 for ag , @xmath42 for au , @xmath43 for ph and @xmath44 for rh .",
    "figures 3 to 8 show the variations of elastic constants of ni , cu , ag , au , pt , rh with respect to temperature .",
    "the change in the bulk moduli of these metals by heating is shown in figure 9 .",
    "the simulation values of the bulk moduli at @xmath30k are the fingerprints for the melting temperature of these metals .",
    "the bulk modulus is higher for higher melting temperature .",
    "the elastic constants results show that the crystals are elastically stable since the stability conditions @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are satisfied and thermal softening behavior is observed as the temperature is increased .    in tables 16 and 17 , the simulation results of ag - au and cu - ni binary alloys are given .",
    "these are the enthalpy of mixing and the densities of ag - au and cu - ni alloys at @xmath27k . in figure 10 ,",
    "the densities of cu - ni and ag - au are drawn with respect to atomic concentrations . again in figure 11 , the enthalpy of mixing for the same alloys are drawn as a function of atomic concentrations .",
    "the sign of enthalpy of mixing is correct at all concentration values .",
    "the mixing of these alloys are enthalpically favorable .",
    "the potentials used in the present dynamic simulations give reasonably accurate description of the thermodynamic properties and the elastic constants .",
    "altough , the parametrization of these potentials are based on the bulk properties at @xmath48k , still it can describe the temperature - dependent behavior of the solid correctly . we find that with an improved parameter sets the sutton - chen potential does quite well in predicting a number of properties of fcc metals in md simulations . in order to simulate the ordinary experimental conditions ( constant pressure ) the npt md method works quite well and determining the zero strain state , @xmath20 , of the system at each concentration and at each temperature is curicial in simulations .    99 a. p. sutton , j. chen , phil . mag .",
