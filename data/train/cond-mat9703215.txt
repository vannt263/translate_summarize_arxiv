    "most probably it is indeed the case if the interaction between bosons is short - range ( compared to the mean interparticle distance @xmath5 ) .",

    "two physical situations where the problem of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose system interacting with a 2d maxwell gauge field were considered in @xcite : classical thermodynamics of vortex line liquid in high - temperature superconductors ( see @xcite for an extensive review ) and low - temperature quantum properties of liquid of holons ( arising in the rvb - type theories @xcite of doped mott dielectric @xcite ) . the arguments were given @xcite in favor of existence of a new unusual ground - state which is still _ liquid _ , but is _ not superfluid_. more recently the same problem was attacked by another approach @xcite , also in relation with rvb - type theories .",
    "still the theoretical arguments in favor of the existence of such unusual ground - state are not quite conclusive ; the results of different computer simulations are in mutual disagreement @xcite . whereas in @xcite two phase transitions and an intermediate state",

    "there are two different questions related with this problem : i ) can one invent such a ground - state in a self - consistent way ? and",
    "ii ) is it realized in some model with a physically realistic long - range interaction ? in the present paper we try to approach the answer to the first of the above questions , using a special model of a 2d bose liquid , introduced originally by kane , kivelson , lee and zhang ( kklz ) @xcite .",
    "the kklz model hamiltonian is constructed in such a way that its exact ground - state wavefunction is of the jastrow type , i.e. it is a product of 1-particle and 2-particle dependent factors . with the special choice of the jastrow function the main ( in the long - wavelength limit ) term of the kklz hamiltonian",
    "is given by a pair - wise logarithmic interaction , i.e. it resembles a 2d static coulomb potential of the real problem discussed in @xcite . on the other hand , special symmetry ( in fact",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we derive the kklz hamiltonian from the condition that it is given by the zero - fermion sector of a supersymmetric nonrelativistic parity - conserving theory , which resembles ( in the long - wavelength limit ) the system of 2d bosons with logarithmic interaction .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath2 of our theory is proportional to the charge of 2d bosons , thus the ground - state possesses superfluidity at low @xmath2 . in sec .",

    "the absence of a shear modulus in the high-@xmath2 ground - state of the hamiltonian ( [ kklz ] ) can also be shown by direct calculation which can be conveniently performed representing potential energy of interaction between particles as u_kklz = _ i ( _ ji ) ^2 + _",
    "ij(*r*_i-*r*_j ) [ poten2 ] now one can calculate the variation of the potential energy ( actually the second sum in ( [ poten2 ] ) does not contribute ) corresponding to an infinitesimal uniform shear deformation @xmath153 of the regular lattice .",
    "then one finds that it does not contain the term proportional to @xmath154 , i.e. the expansion starts from the term @xmath155 , which means that @xmath156 .",
    "the absence of a genuine crystalline state in the kklz model at arbitrary strong interaction @xmath157 stems from its very special form and certainly is not present in a generic 2d bose system .",
    "however , in a more realistic system qhx may exist as an intermediate ground - state realized at moderately large repulsion .",
    "let us consider now the response of the qhx state to a magnetic field @xmath158 .",
    "since particles in this state are almost localized , we can neglect ( in a first approximation ) the multi - particle exchange contributions and estimate susceptibility as @xmath159 ( where @xmath160 is the system s size ) . comparing this expression with the magnetic susceptibility of a superfluid , which is proportional to @xmath161 ,",
    "one concludes that @xmath162 in the qhx state .",
    "now we need to address some apparent paradox : i ) according to eq .",
    "( [ fdt ] ) , normal density @xmath163 is proportional to the integral @xmath164 where the expression under the integral is positive ; ii ) the equal - time current - current correlation function @xmath165 vanishes at @xmath166 ( cf .",
    "( [ ekin ] ) ) ; iii ) then , how it is possible to get nonzero @xmath52 ( and even cancel @xmath37 completely ) ?",
    "in fact , to get nonzero @xmath52 we need to allow for the singular behavior of the function @xmath43 at low @xmath167 ( in other words , the limiting procedure @xmath166 and integration in eq .",
    "( [ fdt ] ) should not commute with each other ) . as a simple example one can consider @xmath168 with @xmath169 .",
    "however , such a behavior of @xmath170 is only possible if there are some gapless excitations in the system , which is just the case in the qhx state ( cf .",
    "( [ hex ] ) ) . in general ,",
    "an appearance of gapless excitations with nonzero momentum ( low - momenta excitations in our system always have large plasmon gap @xmath129 ) may only be a result of a phase transition , which is associated with spontaneous breakdown of the galilei invariance .",
    "generally speaking , the galilei invariance may be spontaneously broken at @xmath171 , which would mean the existence of two phase transitions and some intermediate state between the sf and the qhx states .",
    "we found in previous sections that at small @xmath2 the ground - state @xmath4 possesses total superfluidity ( @xmath131 ) and the excitation spectrum beyond the ground state is gapful ( cf .",
    "( [ interpol ] ) ) . at very large",
    "@xmath92 the ground state is not superfluid at all , @xmath162 , and the excitation spectrum is very soft ( cf .",
    "( [ hex ] ) ) . how does the transition(s ) between these two qualitatively different ground states occur ?",
    "the most trivial possibility would be that of the direct first - order phase transition at @xmath54 .",
    "this would also mean that the first - order melting / crystallization transition happens in the classical 2d coulomb gas at the interaction parameter @xmath172 .",
    "however , the persistence of total superfluidity up to @xmath173 looks rather improbable since at so large values of @xmath2 the characteristic energy of the interaction between particles , @xmath174 , exceeds the kinetic energy @xmath175 by more than 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "note also , that the above - cited value of @xmath103 is about 100 times larger than the naive estimate @xmath176 ; it means that particles are almost localized in rather small regions of space ( much smaller than the mean interparticle distance @xmath5 ) and diffuse from these regions on much longer time scale only .",
    "therefore we suspect that at least two phase transitions take place between the totally sf state and the qhx state .",
    "as we discussed above , the qhx quantum ground - state is seen as a 2d berezinsky crystal with logarithmic interaction as long as only the equal - time density correlations are considered . the nature of melting in such a 2d classical crystal is not quite clear .",
    "the old numerical simulations reported weak first - order transition @xcite , but the recent simulations on the 2d systems with other types of interactions @xcite reveal that to discern between 1st and 2nd order melting one probably would need to simulate systems with a huge number of particles , which was not yet done for the system of interest here .",
    "if melting of such a 2d crystal occurs via halperin - nelson mechanism , then there exists a usual hexatic state which possesses quasi - long - range orientational order , i.e. power - law decay of the orientational order parameter r^-_6 [ 6 ] without any translational order .",
    "the corresponding quantum ground - state would be characterized , apart from orientational quasi - lro , by the isotropic structure factor @xmath110 and by the existence of some gapless mode related with a slow rotation of the @xmath177 angle .",
    "the other possibility is that the melting of the 2d crystal with log - interaction occurs via a first - order phase transition , without hexatic phase ; even in this case there is a room for a phase transition related to the breakdown of the galilei invariance , which would be manifested by an appearance of the gapless mode in the excitation spectrum .",
    "indeed , the absence of normal density @xmath52 in the ground - state of the system with purely potential interactions is the consequence of the galilei invariance of the hamiltonian , which is certainly respected in the low-@xmath2 limit .",
    "an appearance of non - zero @xmath52 is thus related to spontaneous breakdown of the galilei invariance , which may occur at some value of @xmath2 which we denote as @xmath178 . as it was explained above",
    ", we expect @xmath53 , although we still can not prove this inequality .    to conclude this section : if there exists any additional ground - state sandwiched between sf and qhx , then the spectrum of excitations beyond such a state contains a gapless mode with isotropic spectrum : @xmath179",
    ". such a mode may be orthogonal to the density mode and , thus , it may be invisible in the usual structure factor @xmath180 .",
    "we have studied the model hamiltonian of the two - dimensional strongly interacting bose - liquid , which can be considered as a natural generalization of the calogero - sutherland hamiltonian for the 2d case .",
    "this hamiltonian is shown to possess the non - relativistic supersymmetry .",
    "it makes possible to derive a number of exact relations between the equal - time density - density and current - current correlation functions , and to find exactly the low - momentum excitation spectrum of the model , which is given by the one - loop correction to the mean - field result .",
    "the ground state is shown to exist in at least two qualitatively different phases as function of the interaction parameter @xmath2 : the superfluid state at small @xmath2 and the quantum hexatic state at very large @xmath2 .",
    "the arguments are presented in favor of the existence of a third state , intermediate between the two above - mentioned ones .",
    "for the special case of @xmath181 the considered model is shown to be equivalent to the quantum mechanics of normal complex matrices with a gaussian weight , exactly in the same way as the calogero - sutherland model at the special values of its coupling constant is equivalent to the dynamics of the wigner - dyson matrix ensembles .",
    "the model we have studied seems to be very interesting as a natural approximation for the problem of 2d bose - liquid with logarithmic pair - wise interaction , which is widely considered in relation with the composite - boson approach to the description of the fractional quantum hall state  @xcite , as well as in relation with statistics of vortex lines in htsc superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the key physical problem here is the problem of existence of non - superfluid liquid ground - state .",
    "we have shown within the considered model the existence of at least one nontrivial ground - state , which is quantum hexatic , i.e. anisotropic non - superfluid liquid .",
    "it is still an open question if the destruction of superfluidity may occur without _ any _ explicit symmetry - breaking in the real space , i.e. if it might be that the only spontaneously broken symmetry is the galilei invariance . to answer this question it is necessary to study the spectrum of lowest - energy excitations at large wavevectors @xmath182 and at large @xmath183 $ ] and look for the appearance of some gapless mode ; note that such a mode , if it exists , may be orthogonal to the density - oscillation mode , and thus may be absent from the dynamic structure factor @xmath180 .    the exact results obtained make it possible to suspect that the considered model can actually be exactly solvable , at least at some special values of @xmath2 .",
    "there are several directions in which one could try to extend and develop the results presented here : i ) to find the time - dependent correlation functions , at least for @xmath1 , by the solution of the normal - matrix problem ; ii ) to generalize the correspondence between our hamiltonian and the normal matrix problem for other values of @xmath2 ; iii ) to develop an explicitly supersymmetric second - quantized many - body theory and the corresponding diagram technique for our hamiltonian ; this might be very helpful in order to generalize our result for the spectrum , eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) , for an arbitrary momenta @xmath3 . a completely different direction of study of this model",
    "is provided by its equivalence to a fokker - plank equation of multi - particle stochastic dynamics ( cf .",
