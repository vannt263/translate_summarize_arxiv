    "in qcd , the most fundamental quantities one wishes to calculate are the states of the mass spectrum of the theory . in lattice gauge theory ,",
    "such non - perturbative calculations are carried out numerically in the path integral representation to some level of approximation by evaluating the correlation functions by monte - carlo simulation . typically , the computational resources employed in this approach are enormous as one must work with large lattices and spacings which are fine enough to detect the continuum behaviour of the theory in question . hence , non - perturbative analytic results are of considerable interest . in this context , the hamiltonian formalism is appealing .",
    "one often works directly on infinite lattices , fermions are simpler to incorporate ( no fermion determinant ) and 3d as opposed to 4d lattices ( time is continuous ) .",
    "the lack of systematic and applicable methodology has prevented these features from being exploited or investigated - hence , the importance of new methodologies .",
    "here we use a novel approach  the plaquette expansion  based on a large volume expansion of lanczos tridiagonalization .",
    "compact u@xmath1 has become the testing ground for various lattice hamiltonian procedures as it exhibits scaling behaviour similar to the more complex and physically interesting non - abelian lattice gauge theories in @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "the kogut - susskind hamiltonian is  @xcite : @xmath3\\ , \\label{eq : hamu1}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the strong - coupling limit is defined by  @xmath5 and the weak - coupling limit by @xmath6 .",
    "the electric field operator , @xmath7 , and link operator , @xmath8 obey the commutator relations @xmath9={\\hat u}_{l}$ ] and @xmath10=-{\\hat u}_{l}^{\\dag}$ ] and the plaquette  operator @xmath11 acts on the links around the smallest closed ( wilson ) loop or square on the lattice @xmath12 .",
    "one of the quantities of interest in this model is the anti - symmetric or photon mass gap , @xmath0  (  @xmath13  ) , which is given by the difference in energies between the lowest state in the  @xmath14 sector and the vacuum .",
    "the scaling behaviour for the mass gap is expected to be  @xcite : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants , @xmath18 is the lattice spacing and @xmath19 .",
    "the scaling parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not known exactly but have been computed by various numerical techniques : @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( see  @xcite for summary ) .",
    "beginning with a trial state @xmath22 which has the desired symmetries of the state of interest , the lanczos recurrence generates a basis @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the matrix elements of the hamiltonian in tri - diagonal form .",
    "the matrix elements are able to be written in terms of hamiltonian moments @xmath26 .",
    "the connected part of the hamiltonian moment is proportional to the volume of the system @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , one may re - express the matrix elements in terms of the connected vacuum coefficients @xmath28 .",
    "extensivity of the problem leads to the following plaquette expansions in @xmath29  @xcite : @xmath30 + o(s^2)\\equiv { \\bar \\alpha}(s ) , \\label{eq : avac}\\ ] ] @xmath31 + o(s^3)\\equiv { \\bar \\beta^2(s ) } \\label{eq : bvac}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 . in the bulk limit ( @xmath33 ) , keeping @xmath34 fixed , one may perform the exact diagonalization of the lanczos tri - diagonal matrix for the ground state energy density @xmath35 analytically  @xcite : @xmath36 .",
    "for example , for 4th order moments we have : @xmath37 = e_{1 } + \\frac{e_{2}^{2}}{e_{2 } e_4 - e_{3}^{2}}\\,\\left [ \\sqrt{3 e_{3}^{2}-2 e_{2 } e_{4}}-e_{3}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : e0}\\ ] ] for excited states the hamiltonian moments have the form @xmath38 .",
    "thus , in a similar fashion to @xmath35 , one can derive expressions for approximants , @xmath39 $ ] , to the mass gap . again using up to 4th order moments we have  @xcite : @xmath40=\\sum^{4}_{n=1}\\,m^{(s)}_{n}\\,e_2^{n-1}\\,f_{n}(e_{2},e_{3},e_{4 } ) , \\label{eq : mfmg}\\ ] ] where the vacuum moment functions , @xmath41 , are simple algebraic forms given in  @xcite .",
    "initially , lattice hamiltonian calculations employed the simplest gauge invariant trial state  the strong - coupling vacuum @xmath42 ( defined as the state satisfying @xmath43 for every link ) .",
    "this is the perturbative starting point for series calculations , which are then extrapolated to weak coupling .",
    "although the calculation of moments with respect to this state can be carried out to relatively high order , typically , one finds that this state is simply inadequate to explore the non - perturbative weak - coupling regime of the theory . in the case of the plaquette expansion , a window of scaling in terms of the expansion order was evident , but higher order results became problematic  @xcite .",
    "here we utilized a one plaquette exponential trial state , that has the correct strong and weak coupling behaviour for the vacuum energy density  the so - called _ mean - field _",
    "state  @xcite  defined in the so - called @xmath44 representation as : @xmath45 = \\exp\\left\\{\\frac{\\lambda}{2 } \\sum_{p}\\left\\{{u}_{p}+{u}_{p}^{\\dagger}\\right\\}\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is determined variationally from @xmath47 . as the state is constructed from plaquette variables , @xmath48 , it is automatically gauge invariant .",
    "one expects the true ground state of the system to have contributions from all possible wilson loops  an important feature of the plaquette expansion method is that , by its very nature , larger sized wilson loops ( larger clusters ) are systematically introduced .    using a diagrammatic method ( details to be presented elsewhere )",
    "we were able to derive the first four one - plaquette connected moments for both the ground state and anti - symmetric state .",
    "the expressions become rather long , so for brevity these are illustrated in figures [ fig : gsmom ] and [ fig : asmom ] , along the curve @xmath49 .",
    "these moments immediately give analytic approximates for vacuum energy and the mass gap .",
    "the plaquette expansion results are presented in figure  [ fig : compmfmg ] .",
    "clearly scaling is evident for inverse - coupling values @xmath50 to @xmath51 , passing the transition point at @xmath52 .",
    "the scaling form we find is given by @xmath53 , and agrees well with other estimates  ( summarized in  @xcite ) .",
    "although we have presented results for only the first four moments ( for which the calculation is entirely analytic ) it should in principle be possible to derive higher moments with respect to this state .",
    "indeed we have preliminary results for the ground state energy density to sixth order giving high accuracy over a large range of couplings .    for the future application of this method to @xmath54 , the main obstacle to overcome",
    "is the calculation of the moments in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the appeal of 2 + 1 systems as toy models is that the transformation from link variables to plaquette variables is trivial and makes the integrations tractable  hence the analytic work reported here . in 3 + 1 dimensions it is well known that the transformation can not be carried out in closed form due to the appearance of bianchi identities . however , the calculation of moments in 3 + 1 dimensions by monte - carlo is actually a relatively small scale numerical exercise . because we are dealing with a cluster expansion ( we need only connected moments ) the lattices required are fairly modest in extent and , by definition , only 3 dimensional .",
    "the integrands become complicated as larger correlations are included , which means that the statistics must be very good , however , preliminary calculations have demonstrated that the required precision is possible to achieve without supercomputing resources",
