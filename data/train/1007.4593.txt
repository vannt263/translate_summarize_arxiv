    "m - dwarfs are under intense scrutiny as potential planet hosts .",
    "m - dwarfs have sufficiently low masses ( @xmath4 ) and small radii ( @xmath5 ) that exoplanets induce considerably larger reflex velocities and transit depths than an identical planet would around larger , more massive hosts .",
    "accordingly , most of the lowest - mass planets detected to date orbit low - mass stars .",
    "m - dwarfs relatively low luminosities also ensure that habitable planets will be in small , fast orbits , producing higher reflex radial velocity amplitudes , and a greater likelihood , depth , and frequency of transit events @xcite .",
    "m - dwarfs constitute more than two thirds of the nearby stellar population @xcite ; identifying the most likely planet hosts in advance would greatly enhance the efficiency of m - dwarf exoplanet surveys .",
    "observations of fgk - dwarfs have convincingly shown that gas giant planet frequency rises steeply with host star metallicity , a result known as the planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "determining if this correlation extends into the m - dwarf regime requires accurate metallicity estimates for ultra - cool stars . as m - dwarf spectra are dominated by chemically complex molecular features ,",
    "_ a priori _ spectral synthesis does not well match the observed spectra .",
    "most attempts to calibrate m - dwarf metallicity indicators have therefore focused on observational studies of wide binaries , where the robustly estimated [ fe / h ] of the fgk - primary is assumed to describe the m - dwarf secondary as well . this assumption will hold if both binary components formed from the same well - mixed molecular cloud , and no mass transfer or dredge - up has occurred in the system . adopted this technique to develop a photometric metallicity calibration that suggested that nearby m - dwarfs , including the planet hosts gj 876 and gj 436 , were slightly metal poor .",
    "@xcite also estimated subsolar metallicities for gj 436 , gj 581 and gj 876 from spectral synthesis of optical spectra .",
    "though there were only a small number of m - dwarf planet hosts in their samples , the results of the b05 and @xcite studies were unexpected , since they imply that planet formation around m - dwarfs does not depend on the star s metal content .",
    "this finding is difficult to reconcile with the planet - metallicity correlation for fgk - dwarfs , and runs counter to the predictions of the commonly accepted core accretion model @xcite .",
    "* ja09 hereafter ) derived a new photometric metallicity calibration using 6 m - dwarfs with wide , metal - rich fgk companions not present in the b05 study .",
    "ja09 found that the previous photometric calibration systematically underestimated the metallicities of these metal - rich stars .",
    "ja09 attributed this discrepancy to the lack of metal - rich calibrators in the b05 sample and/or the use of visual magnitudes with poorly characterized uncertainties .",
    "ja09 also estimated the metallicities of 7 m - dwarfs with planetary - mass companions , concluding that m - dwarf planet hosts are preferentially metal - rich , just like fgk planet hosts .",
    "ja09 suggested that the lack of jovian planets around m - dwarfs is most likely due to the influence of stellar mass , not stellar metallicity , on the planet formation process , consistent with the work of @xcite on giant planet formation around red dwarfs .",
    "* sg10 hereafter ) recently revised the b05 and ja09 photometric calibrations , finding that they systematically underestimate or overestimate metallicity at the extremes of their range .",
    "their results hint that low - mass planets may be more likely to be found around metal - rich m - dwarfs , which disagrees with the almost equal probability of finding neptune - mass planets around a metal - rich or a metal - poor fgk - star .",
    "existing methods for estimating m - dwarf metallicities rely heavily on observations at visual wavelengths , where metallic absorption lines and molecules strongly influence a star s spectrum .",
    "mid- to late-",
    "m - dwarfs are typically too faint for high - quality observations at visual wavelengths , which has limited most metallicity analyses to early - m - dwarfs and a few nearby stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "lacking a satisfactory way to estimate metallicities across the entire m - dwarf sequence has limited our understanding of planet formation around the lowest mass stars .",
    "in this letter , we present a technique for estimating the metallicity of field m - dwarfs from the strength of prominent k - band absorption features .",
    "we calibrated our technique using spectra of m - dwarfs with existing [ fe / h ] estimates , adopted as a proxy for their overall metallicities , obtained from the analysis of a wide fgk - companion .",
    "our technique does not depend on accurate parallaxes and v magnitudes , or high - resolution , high - signal - to - noise spectra , as required by previous techniques .",
    "instead , our technique requires simply a k - band spectrum at moderate resolution , which can be efficiently obtained for many m - dwarfs with current near - infrared spectrographs .",
    "our method will enable metallicity estimates to be generated for stars which are too cool or too distant for other methods , identify the most advantageous targets for planet - searches around cool stars , and thus improve our understanding of planet formation around low - mass stars . in  2 , we describe our observations and data reduction .",
    "we present our analysis and results in  3 , and summarize and discuss our conclusions in  4 .",
    "near - infrared spectra of the stars in this work were obtained with the triplespec spectrograph on the palomar hale telescope @xcite during 7 observing runs between 2007 and 2009 .",
    "triplespec at palomar has no moving parts and simultaneously acquires 5 cross - dispersed orders covering 1.0 - 2.4 @xmath1 m at a resolution of @xmath6@xmath72700 .",
    "the spectra were reduced with an idl - based data reduction pipeline developed by p. muirheadmuirhead/#downloads ] .",
    "the data were sky - subtracted using a sky - frame made by median combining 5 exposures with the science target placed at different positions along the slit .",
    "each sky - subtracted exposure was then divided by a normalized flat - field , wavelength calibrated and optimally extracted @xcite .",
    "the spectra were flux - calibrated and telluric corrected using observations of an a0v star at a similar airmass with the idl - based code @xmath8_@xmath9 by @xcite .",

    "ja09 assume that the mean m@xmath14 versus v - k@xmath13 relation in the solar neighborhood is equivalent to an [ fe / h]=-0.05 metallicity contour , with stars brighter than this being metal - rich , and fainter stars being metal - poor .",
    "most of the mid - type and all of the late - type m - dwarfs fail both of these conditions : they lack accurate parallaxes and/or johnson v magnitudes , so were not included in the ja09 calibration .",
    "we have empirically calibrated several nir spectral features to serve as effective m - dwarf metallicity indicators .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the k - band spectra of three m4-m4.5 dwarfs in our sample , along with updated phoenix models @xcite with effective temperatures equivalent to an @xmath0m3.5 - 4 star and varying metallicities .",
    "the overall shape of the k - band spectrum is well represented by the updated phoenix models , and the na i doublet ( 2.206 @xmath1 m & 2.209 @xmath1 m ) and the ca i triplet ( 2.261 @xmath1 m , 2.263 @xmath1 m & 2.265 @xmath1 m ) are seen to strengthen considerably with metallicity .",
    "there is a discrepancy , however , between the strengths of these features in our spectra and in the models of comparable metallicity .",
    "we measured the equivalent width ( ew ) of the na i and the ca i features to differentiate between metal - rich and metal - poor m - dwarfs .",
    "each spectrum was normalized and the ews were calculated by computing the ratio of the area of a feature to a pseudocontinuum across that feature , computed from featureless regions on either side of it , using the the idl - based function ` measure_ew ` by n. konidaris and j. harker .",
    "uncertainties in the ews were obtained from the errors in the estimated pseudocontinuum and the errors in the measured intensities of each feature , as described in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig3]a compares the spocs [ fe / h ] for our m - dwarf metallicity calibrators to the ews of their ca i triplets ; figure [ fig3]b compares the ews of the na i and the ca i features for our m - dwarf sample .",
    "the correspondence between the na i and ca i features and the metallicity of m - dwarfs is evident : metal - poor m - dwarfs have lower ews than metal - rich m - dwarfs .",
    "the strength of these features also depend on temperature and surface gravity , however , as do most atomic lines in the nir spectra of m - dwarfs @xcite .    to explicitly account for the influence of stellar temperature on the strengths of na and ca lines , we include an independent , temperature sensitive spectral index in our analysis .",

    "the linear relation between h@xmath16o - k index and the khm spectral types of spectral standards in our sample is :    @xmath21    we report the spectral types estimated from equation ( 1 ) for the metallicity calibration m - dwarfs and planet hosts in table 1 , rounded to the nearest half subtype .",

    "we estimate systematic errors , such as the zero - point value and the inclusion of a non - physically bound binary as a metallicity calibrator , to be of the order of @xmath00.06 ( spocs data ) and @xmath00.03 , respectively .",
    "the combined systematic error is of the same order of the structure in the [ fe / h ] residuals of the calibration sample .",
    "we note that the predicted [ fe / h ] for some of the planet hosts lie above the [ fe / h ] boundaries of the calibrators .",
    "the values of the ews of na i and ca i , the h@xmath16o - k index and [ fe / h ] values for the metallicity calibration m - dwarfs and planet hosts , are given in table 1 .",
    "the best fit linear combination of the ews of the ca i and the na i features are plotted in figure [ fig4]a versus the h@xmath16o - k index of our m - dwarf sample .",
    "there is a clear distinction between the m - dwarfs with metal - rich and metal - poor fgk - dwarf companions in figure [ fig4]a ; the spocs [ fe / h ] values of our m - dwarf metallicity calibrators are also plotted in figure [ fig4]b against the value of their h@xmath16o - k index .",
    "the m - dwarfs with photometric metallicity estimates calculated by ja09 are also bisected between metal - rich and metal - poor using these k - band features .",
    "moreover , we found that all of the m - dwarf planet hosts have metallicities much higher than the mean metallicity of m - dwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( [ fe / h]@xmath28@xmath0 - 0.17 ) , defined by sg10 .",
    "the jovian planet hosts are co - located with the m - dwarf companions of metal - rich fgk stars in the upper portion of fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , while the neptune planet hosts are located just above the m - dwarf companions of metal - poor fgk stars .",
    "we have found that the ews of the ca i triplet , the na i doublet , and water absorption in the k - band differentiate metal - rich and metal - poor m - dwarfs , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "we estimate [ fe / h ] values higher than -0.05 dex for eight m - dwarf planet hosts , with the jovian planet hosts being more metal - rich than their neptune host analogs ( table 1 ) .",
    "our results , along with the conclusions of ja09 and sg10 that m - dwarf planet hosts appear to be systematically metal - rich , are consistent with the metallicity distribution of fgk - dwarfs with planets .",
    "we also estimated spectral types for the m - dwarf planet hosts and metallicity calibrators in our sample , using the h@xmath16o - k index defined by @xcite .",
    "our spectral type estimates agree well with the khm spectral types @xcite , modulo the @xmath01 subtype errors ( table 1 ) .",
    "we do find discrepancies , however , with the spectral types of some of the most metal - rich and metal - poor stars in our sample .",
    "the metal - rich planet hosts gj 849 and gj 876 have later spectral types in the khm system than are indicated by the h@xmath16o - k index .",
    "a possible explanation is that the khm system relies strongly on the double - metal tio and vo molecular bands in the 6300 - 9000 @xmath22 wavelength range .",
    "these molecular bands are known to be metallicity dependent ( e.g. the subdwarf classification by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : they grow stronger with increasing metallicity as well as decreasing temperature . while the khm system includes the overall shape of the stellar spectrum , this does not change considerably for early m - dwarfs , such that metal - rich early - type m - dwarfs with strong molecular features could be easily mistaken for less - metal rich later - type m - dwarfs .",
    "this reasoning can also be applied to gj 611 b , the most metal - poor star in our sample : we derive an m6 spectral type from its h@xmath16o - k index , while its khm spectral type is m4 , consistent with its weak tio and vo bands being interpreted as a temperature effect rather than a sign of its low metallicity .",
    "measuring m - dwarf metallicities will also improve our ability to determine key physical parameters for both stars and planets .",
    "the masses and radii of m - dwarf planet hosts are typically derived from theoretical models , and/or empirical relationships between these parameters and the star s temperature and luminosity , all of which have a strong dependence on metallicity . since minimum planetary masses inferred from rv measurements are tied to the mass of the host star , and planetary radii derived from transit observations depend directly on the adopted stellar radius , errors in stellar parameters lead directly to errors in inferred planetary properties .",
    "report a stellar mass of 0.3 m@xmath29 for gj 876 , but with an uncertainty of @xmath030@xmath30 due primarily to the uncertainty in the host s metallicity , which affected the initial estimate of the masses of its planetary companions .",
    "recent measured m - dwarf radii and masses have typical errors less than 10@xmath30 @xcite , but the errors may increase somewhat for stars with significantly non - solar metallicities . with poor estimates of the mass and radius of exoplanets , it is harder to constrain their true composition , atmospheres and interiors .    despite the fact that k - band alkali features are temperature / gravity dependent @xcite , and prone to non - local thermodynamic equilibrium effects , our empirical analysis demonstrates that the dispersion in ew of the ca i and na i features can diagnose the metal abundance of m - dwarfs with roughly the same temperature ( h@xmath16o - k index ) and gravitym co band - head ) to distinguish between dwarfs and giants prior to interpreting na i and ca i feature strengths as metallicity indicators . ] .",
    "our method has an advantage with respect to previous photometric and optical spectroscopic calibrations , since it does not depend on parallaxes or v magnitudes , allowing us to cover a larger sample of cooler and distant m - dwarfs .",
    "our results enable the identification of the most advantageous m - dwarfs for planetary search surveys around cool stars , such as the triplespec exoplanet discovery instrument ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tedi ) , mearth @xcite , the precision radial velocity spectrograph ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pvrs ) , and the crires survey by @xcite , and will thus help unravel the formation mechanisms of planets around m - dwarfs .",

    "<S> a metal - rich environment facilitates planet formation , making metal - rich stars the most favorable targets for surveys seeking to detect new exoplanets . </S>",
    "<S> using this advantage to identify likely low - mass planet hosts , however , has been difficult : until now , methods to determine m - dwarf metallicities required observationally expensive data ( such as parallaxes and high - resolution spectra ) , and were limited to a few bright cool stars . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained moderate ( r@xmath02700 ) resolution k - band spectra of 17 m - dwarfs with metallicity estimates derived from their fgk companions . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of these spectra , and inspection of theoretical synthetic spectra , reveal that an m - dwarf s metallicity can be inferred from the strength of its na i doublet ( 2.206 @xmath1 m & 2.209 @xmath1 m ) and ca i triplet ( 2.261 @xmath1 m , 2.263 @xmath1 m & 2.265 @xmath1 m ) absorption lines . </S>",
    "<S> we use these features , and a temperature - sensitive water index , to construct an empirical metallicity indicator applicable for m - dwarfs with near - solar metallicities ( -0.5@xmath2[fe / h]@xmath2 + 0.5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicator has an accuracy of @xmath30.15 dex , comparable to that of existing techniques for estimating m - dwarf metallicities , but is more observationally accessible , requiring only a moderate resolution k - band spectrum . applying this method to 8 known m - dwarf planet hosts </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) in excess of the mean metallicity of m - dwarfs in the solar neighborhood , consistent with the metallicity distribution of fgk planet hosts . </S>"
