    "in the continuum formulation of @xmath2 quantum gravity one is interested in studying the coupling of conformally invariant matter to gravity .",
    "the conformal matter is characterized by its central charge @xmath4 but yet it has only been possible to solve theories with @xmath5 analytically .",
    "this has triggered a lot of numerical work on discretized models of @xmath2 gravity with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one such discretization method is dynamical triangulations where the integration over space - time manifolds is replaced by a sum over piecewise linear surfaces constructed by gluing together equilateral triangles .",
    "the matter is simulated by spins , living either on triangles or vertices .",
    "the spin models usually used are the @xmath7 , 3 and 4-state potts models and the gaussian model .",
    "all these models have continuous phase transitions on regular lattices , with divergent correlation length , and hence can be associated with some conformal field theories in the continuum limit .",
    "the above mentioned models all correspond to conformal theories with @xmath8 but taking multiple copies of them allows one to study numerically theories with @xmath6 coupled to gravity . for unlike in the continuum formulation",
    "the discretized models are well defined for @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath9 the potts models have a discontinuous or 1@xmath10 order phase transition on regular lattices and hence no corresponding conformal field theories . so until now coupling them to gravity has been discarded as uninteresting .",
    "but a recent mean field solution of the @xmath11 state potts model coupled to gravity showed the model to have a 3@xmath12 order magnetization transition from a high - temperature branched polymer phase to a low temperature pure gravity phase ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover the model was shown to be equivalent to infinite copies of ising models coupled to gravity ( a @xmath14 model ) .    by expanding around the @xmath11 solution",
    "this analysis was extended down to finite values of @xmath3 . there",
    "_ two _ phase transitions were found with high- and low - temperature pure gravity phases separated by a branched polymer phase .",
    "the critical behavior of those transitions was identical , both had the specific heat exponent @xmath15 .",
    "as the value of @xmath3 is decreased the two phase transitions merge at some critical value @xmath16 and the branched polymer phase disappears . at that value of @xmath3 ( estimated to be @xmath17 in @xcite )",
    "the perturbation expansion breaks down .",
    "it is worth comparing this with the situation for multiple @xmath18 state potts models coupled to gravity . for @xmath8",
    "the interaction between gravity and matter is weak , for all values of the coupling _ except _",
    "@xmath19 we have a pure gravity phase .",
    "but for larger values of @xmath4 numerical simulations indicate a high- and low - temperature pure gravity phase with a branched polymer phase in between , i.e. the same scenario as for high-@xmath3 .",
    "so the similarity between these two cases might indicate that the study of potts models for large value of @xmath3 might give us informations about models with large central charge coupled to gravity .",
    "it might be possible that after coupling to gravity these model would describe some conformal matter coupled to gravity , the only problem being that we have not yet identified these conformal theories .",
    "this has prompted us to look at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 state potts models coupled to gravity applying monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "using micro - canonical simulations ( fixed area ) the models are defined by @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the potts spins , @xmath22 is a lattice triangle , @xmath23 a spin configuration on the triangulation @xmath24 and @xmath25 an appropriate class of triangulations ( of size @xmath26 ) . in these simulations",
    "we include triangulations allowing sites joined by more than one link and sites connected to them selves as these can be shown to reduce finite size effects @xcite .",
    "the triangulations were updated using the link - flip algorithm and the spin models with the swendsen - wang cluster algorithm .",
    "the lattice sizes used were between 250 and 8000 triangles and , as the auto - correlations increase linearly with @xmath3 , we used @xmath27 and @xmath28 sweeps for each @xmath29 value for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 state potts model respectively .",
    "the first interesting question is the order of the phase transitions , are they continuous or discontinuous after coupling to gravity .",
    "this we determine by looking at the scaling of the maximum of the specific heat with lattice size . if a phase transition is 1_st _ order @xmath30 should scale linearly with the volume . from fig .",
    "1_a _ , where we plot the specific heat versus @xmath29 for the @xmath0 state potts model , we see that the maximum increases slowly with lattice size .",
    "looking at the quantity @xmath31 it approaches zero in the infinity volume limit , which is a strong indication for a continuous phase transition .",
    "another quantity sensitive to the order of the phase transition is the energy cumulant @xmath32 if the transition is 1_st _ order @xmath33 should reach a non - zero minimum in the critical point , otherwise it is zero for all values of @xmath29 . in fig .",
    "1_b _ we show that for the @xmath0 state potts model no indication of a non - zero minimum can be seen .    exactly the same is seen for the @xmath1 state potts model , and from these measurements we conclude that both models have continuous magnetization transitions after coupling to gravity .",
    "it it might at first seem strange that the order of the phase transition can change that drastically with coupling to gravity , but we should remember that even for one ising model ( which can be solved explicitly ) there is a change from a 2_nd _ to a 3_rd _ order transition with coupling to gravity .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to locate the critical temperatures for the models we used the finite size scaling behavior of two quantities : _ ( a ) _ location of the peak in the specific heat and _ ( b ) _ the intersection of binder s cumulant for different lattice sizes .",
    "both quantities are expected to approach @xmath19 as @xmath34 .",
    "the fits to the scaling behavior are made easier as @xmath35 can be determined directly from binder s cumulant , as the maximum of its slope scales as @xmath36 .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "we then applied standard finite size scaling in @xmath19 to extract the the critical exponents @xmath29 ( from the magnetization @xmath37 ) , @xmath35 ( from @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 ( from the magnetic susceptibility @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 ( both from the scaling of @xmath30 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "for @xmath0 we tested that the scaling of the specific heat fits equally well to logarithmic divergence ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is an interesting observation that the critical exponents for the @xmath0 state potts model are very close to that of the @xmath44 state potts model coupled to gravity ( which has @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "as the value @xmath0 is chosen arbitrary this might indicate that there exists an whole range of @xmath3 values , starting at @xmath44 and ending at some @xmath16 , where we have the same critical behavior after coupling to gravity .",
    "on the other hand the @xmath1 state potts model has @xmath41 close to @xmath49 , so we might be in the high-@xmath3 region were the calculation in @xcite is valid .",
    "then we would expect a branched polymer phase and two phase transitions .",
    "unfortunately we have only been able to locate one , but as the other one is not a magnetization transition it is not clear how to identify it .",
    "but for an interval of @xmath29 , before @xmath19 , we see some evidence of a branched polymer phase , supporting the picture in @xcite .",
    "from this the following critical behavior of the @xmath3-state potts models coupled to gravity sounds reasonable : for @xmath44 up to some @xmath50 we have the same critical behavior , i.e. a 2_nd _ order phase transition ( @xmath51 ) where the details of the potts models are less important than the coupling to gravity . and for @xmath52 we also have the same critical behavior , this time with ( presumable two ) 3_rd _ order phase transitions ( @xmath15 ) and a branched polymer phase . whether @xmath53 or if we have some different behavior at intermediary values of @xmath3 is not determined in these simulations .",
    "but it is clear that we need some theoretical understanding of what kind of conformal matter ( if any ) the @xmath54 state potts model coupled to gravity describes",
