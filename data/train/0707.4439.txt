    "a number of new hidden charm states were observed recently by experiments , such as @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath12 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "their quark structures are still not fully understood @xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath6 , which exhibits various impenetrable aspects , is labeled as the poster boy of the new heavy hadrons @xcite .",
    "although the quantum numbers @xmath13 of @xmath6 are strongly favored by the experiments , there is not a definite answer on its components yet due to the fact that none of the interpretations can fit all the available experiments satisfactorily .",
    "the assignment of @xmath6 as a @xmath14 charmonium state , even without the mass gap problem charmonium predicted by the quark model is about 100 mev larger than the measured @xmath6 . ] as claimed by calculations based on the lattice qcd recently in @xcite , also bears other difficulties .",
    "the tiny decay width of @xmath6 , whose upper bound is 2.3 mev with 90% confidence level , is much less than the number predicted in theory @xcite .",
    "another puzzle is the g parity violation indicated by the measurement of the ratio of branching fractions @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the difficulties of the charmonium interpretation invoke various models for the structure of @xmath6 , such as multi - quark state@xcite , hybrid meson @xcite , nuclear - like molecular state @xcite and so on . in one word ,",
    "the inner structure of @xmath6 is still not settled down .",
    "in addition to the intriguing particle @xmath6 , other heavy hidden charm mesons @xmath16 , @xmath12 and @xmath7 mentioned above also attract comprehensive attention recently @xcite , among which @xmath12 can be well established as the first radial excited states of tensor charmonium @xmath17 reasonably and will be left out in this paper . even though the experimental results of @xmath1 and @xmath0 are essentially consistent with theoretical expectations , there are still some particular aspects deserving further investigations @xcite . besides , we also predict the production rate of @xmath2 state in the weak @xmath8 decays , which has not discovered .",
    "in addition , the @xmath18 mixing of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which is of great interest in quarkonium physics , is considered in the weak decays of @xmath8 .",
    "more important , we also investigate the production of @xmath7 and @xmath21 in the weak @xmath8 decays as the mixing of @xmath22 and @xmath23 states .",
    "for the completeness , the @xmath24 mixing of @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the @xmath8 decay is also included .    in this work , we do not attempt to discuss all the explanations of these states .",
    "instead , we concentrate on the assignment of these heavy mesons as charmonium states with the possible quantum numbers constrained by the available experiments and then study their production properties in the @xmath8 decays . to be more specific",
    ", we will assign the @xmath6 as a @xmath14 charmonium , the @xmath7 as a @xmath27 charmonium , the @xmath4 being either @xmath28 or @xmath14 charmonium , and @xmath29 state for the @xmath5 , the quantum numbers of which as the charmonium states are most favored by the current experiments @xcite , although there is overpopulation of @xmath30 meson in the charmonium family .",
    "the non - leptonic weak decays @xmath31 and @xmath32 have been studied in @xcite in order to pry information of the inner structure of @xmath6 .",
    "it is found there that different @xmath10 assignment of @xmath6 will give quite different decay rate for future experiments to measure . here",
    "we will focus on the semi - leptonic weak production of charmonium particles in @xmath8 decays , where it is theoretically easier compared with that of non - leptonic decays .",
    "we will see that the different assignments of @xmath10 quantum number to @xmath33 will give remarkable different branching ratios of semi - leptonic decays .",
    "therefore our predictions can be used by future experiments to test the quark structures of these mesons .",
    "the main job of calculating the branching fractions of the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath8 is to properly evaluate the hadronic matrix elements for @xmath34 ( @xmath35= pseudo - scalar ( @xmath36 ) , scalar ( @xmath37 ) , vector ( @xmath38 ) or axial vector ( @xmath39 ) charmonium ) , namely the transition form factors .",
    "the precise calculations of form factors are very complicated due to the non - perturbative qcd effects in the hadron as a bound state .",
    "several methods have been developed to deal with this problem on the market so far , such as simple quark model @xcite , light - front approach @xcite , qcd sum rules ( svz ) @xcite , light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite , perturbative qcd factorization approach @xcite .",
    "although the qcd sum rules approach has made a big success , short distance expansion fails in non - perturbative condensate when applying the three - point sum rules to the computations of form factors in the large momentum transfer or large mass limit of heavy meson decays .",
    "the light - cone qcd sum rules , as a marriage of qcd sum rules techniques and the theory of hard exclusive processes , were developed in an attempt to overcome the difficulties @xcite involved in the svz sum rules .",
    "the basic idea of light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite is to adopt the twist expansion of correlation functions near the light - cone instead of the dimension expansion of operators at short distance .",
    "therefore , the essential inputs in the light - cone qcd sum rules is the hadronic distribution amplitudes other than vacuum condensates in the qcd sum rules .",
    "one important advantage of light - cone qcd sum rules is that it allows a systematic inclusion of both hard scattering effects and soft contributions @xcite . in view of the above arguments",
    ", we will estimate the form factors for @xmath8 to charmonium states based on the light - cone qcd sum rules approach in this work .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows : we first display the light - cone distribution amplitudes of various charmonium states in section [ distribution amplitudes ] . the light - cone qcd sum rules for the form factors responsible for the decay modes @xmath40",
    "are derived in section [ standard procedure ] .",
    "the numerical computations of form factors in light - cone qcd sum rules are performed in section [ numerical results ] .",
    "the decay rates for semileptonic decays of @xmath8 to various charmonium states , a brief analysis on comparisons with the results that obtained with the help of other approaches in the literature and discussions on the s - d mixing of @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the weak decay of @xmath8 are also included in this section .",
    "the last section is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of pseudoscalar charmonium can be defined by the following non - local matrix element @xcite @xmath41 , \\label{pseudoscalar das}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are twist-2 and twist-3 lcdas of the pseudoscalar charmonium respectively .",
    "the decay constant @xmath44 can be determined generally by decay width of the double photons decay of the pseudoscalar meson as @xcite @xmath45 making use of the branching fractions of @xmath46 and the full width of @xmath47 @xcite @xmath48 we can achieve the decay constant @xmath49 as @xmath50 .",
    "however , there is no data on @xmath51 till now , hence it is impossible to extract the decay constant of @xmath52 directly from the experiments . in view of this point",
    ", we fix the decay constant @xmath53 through the assumption , @xmath54 , which has been used in @xcite before . the decay constant of vector charmonium can be derived through leptonic decay @xmath55 as @xmath56 combining the above relation and the data given in @xcite @xmath57 we can obtain the decay constants of @xmath58 as @xmath59 in light of the assumption mentioned above , we arrive at the decay constant of @xmath52 as @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , the decay constant of @xmath0 can be determined as @xmath61 .",
    "it needs to be pointed out that the tensor structure , which is suppressed in the heavy quark limit , has been neglected in the right hand side of the eq .",
    "( [ pseudoscalar das ] ) .",
    "when it comes to the explicit forms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we will adopt a simple model advocated in @xcite .",
    "firstly , one should write down the schr@xmath62dinger equal - time wave function @xmath63 for the coulomb potential , and then perform the fourier transformation of it to the momentum space as @xmath64 .",
    "next , in terms of the substitution assumption proposed in @xcite ( see also eq .",
    "( [ substitution assumption ] ) ) , we can derive the expression of wave function @xmath65 from @xmath64 , where the momentum fractions @xmath66 , @xmath67 of @xmath68 and @xmath69 quarks in the charmonium satisfy the relation @xmath70 .",
    "finally , one can achieve at the lcdas of charmonium @xmath71 by integrating over the transverse momentum @xmath72 .",
    "based on this prescription , we can obtain the lcdas for @xmath52 as @xmath73 ^ 2 \\over [ 1 - 4 x(1-x)(1-{v^2 \\over 9})]^3 } \\bigg \\}^{1-v^2 } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "subsequently , similar observations to the final states being the @xmath80 pair can be achieved : even a small mixing angle can result in considerable effectrs on the decay rates of @xmath81 , while branching fractions of the corresponding channels @xmath82 do not vary significantly .",
    "a number of new heavy charmonium states , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are observed during the past several years . there",

    "we give the decay rates for semi - leptonic decays of @xmath84 and @xmath0 , which agree with that derived in other frameworks . besides",
