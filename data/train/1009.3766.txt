    "the concept of an acoustic analogy was introduced by lighthill @xcite .",
    "this idea offered him the possibility to derive important results on the generation of aerodynamic noise without relying on expansions or perturbation schemes .",
    "this is especially important , as the acoustic energy generated by an unsteady flow field represents usually only a minute part of the energy flux occurring in the flow and errors which are small compared to the flow quantities may be very large if one compares them with the sound quantities .",
    "the conditions under which perturbation schemes based on small sound level or on small flow mach number may be used , have been clarified in later researches @xcite , although there still remain open questions .",
    "lighthill derived without any approximations an exactly valid equation , which admits an acoustic interpretation .",
    "he showed that every compressible flow fulfills an inhomogeneous wave equation with a quadrupole type source distribution .",
    "as the inhomogeneous wave equation describes the generation and propagation of sound in an ideal acoustic medium at rest , he had related aerodynamic noise to sound waves in the ideal acoustic medium .",
    "this relation is exactly true , but it relates the effects of convection and refraction by a steady basic flow to a source distribution in an acoustic medium without flow and this is difficult to visualize .",
    "one is therefore inclined to look for a relation to an ideal acoustic medium in motion .    here",
    "we will identify the operator which describes the propagation of sound in irrotational , isentropic flow and we will base the analogy on that operator .",
    "this of course does not mean , that vortices or entropy inhomogeneities are excluded .",
    "it is very similar to the situation found in lighthill s analogy .",
    "there , flows were exluded from the medium and they occurred as sources .",
    "here , vortices and entropy inhomogeneities are excluded and they occur as sources .",
    "the equation is therefore very well suited to study the sound radiation from vortices which are convected in an irrotational flow .",
    "the acoustic variable which we use is the stagnation enthalpy .",
    "this variable has been used with aeroacoustic applications in mind before @xcite .",
    "the equations considered before differ however from that derived here , but compare @xcite .",
    "the operator which replaces the wave operator here is a self - adjoint one , even if the flow field is completely arbitrary .",
    "it is not necessary that it is irrotational or that it fulfills the basic eqations of fluid dynamics .",
    "the self - adjointness leads to a reciprocity principle which is valid for an exchange of source and observer .",
    "it also implies the existence of a variational principle from which the basic equation of the analogy can be derived .",
    "this principle is the simplest generalization of the variational principle for the wave equation , partial derivatives with respect to time are replaced by material derivatives , which seems natural if one requires galilei - invariance . from the variational principle",
    "one can then conclude the validity of an energy theorem .",
    "the main drawback is of course the lack of a simple explicit expression for the green s function .",
    "notice however , that for certain important situations a green s function to first order has been determined in @xcite .",
    "an alternative would of course be a numerical solution . to check its feasibility , a general purpose pde - solver for",
    "a pc has been applied to calculate the sound generated by a two - dimensional vortex convected along a circular cylinder .",
    "lighthill based his theory of aerodynamic sound generation on an eqaution , which he obtained by cross - differentiation from the euler equations and from the continuity equation @xmath0 namely @xmath1 here @xmath2 denotes the density , @xmath3 the pressure , @xmath4 the speed of sound , and @xmath5 the particle velocity .",
    "this equation is valid for isentropic flow if losses and temporal variations of the speed of sound can be ignored .",
    "temporal averages can be subtracted , therefore one may assume that only fluctuating quantities are contained in eq.([gl1 ] ) .",
    "no linearization has been performed in the derivation",
    ". therefore eq.([gl1 ] ) is valid under very general conditions .",
    "often , especially for low mach number flows , one neglects the acoustic contributions in the double divergence in eq.([gl1 ] ) and considers this term as a known source term for the sound generation .",
    "then one describes the sound field as a wave obeying the wave equation , i.e. as a sound field propagating in a non - moving medium .",
    "convection and refraction effects are then neglected .",
    "eq.([gl1 ] ) is however generally true and these effects are in principle contained in eq.([gl1 ] ) .",
    "attempts to extract them have been made by separating the velocity into a mean and fluctuating part and thereby to obtain these effects . although it should be possible to describe",
    "mean flow effects in this way , it has been felt that a more apropriate description should be obtained through a modification of eq.([gl1 ] ) . instead of the wave operator , a `` convected wave operator '' which describes",
    "the propagation of sound in a moving medium seems more apropriate .",
    "one then rewrites all fluid quantities as a superposition @xmath6 of `` nonacoustic '' and `` acoustic '' variables and rewrites the basic equations in terms of these variables .",
    "if one neglects contributions which are nonlinear in the non - subscribed variables , one obtains the acoustic equations .",
    "it is well known , that one can derive from this system one `` convected wave equation '' for unidirectional ( in @xmath7-direction ) shear flow or for potential flows , namely @xmath8 for unidirectional and with an acoustic potential @xmath9 @xmath10 for irrotational flows . for aerodynamic noise one should not neglect the nonlinear terms .",
    "it is however possible , very similar to lighthill s approach , to collect the linear and nonlinear terms and to derive an inhomogeneous wave equation .",
    "it is even possible  and it has been done e.  g. by tam and auriault @xcite  to follow this approach in the full continuity and euler equations and derive an inhomogeneous linear system of equations",
    ". then one could use for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc .",
    "the temporal mean values .",
    "the equations which are obtained by this method are much more complicated than the wave equation and are usually solvable only numerically .",
    "furthermore they are rather different from the equations usually studied in mathematical physics and little is known about existence and uniqueness of solutions .",
    "it is however known , that the linear parts of the equations agree with the stability equations and as many flows are unstable , one has to expect , that the equations will be unstable . of course",
    ", exponentially growing solutions are physically excluded  at least for longer times  and therefore they do not occur in the correct solutions .",
    "small errors will however produce these instabilities and provisions have to be made to limit their growth .",
    "how these provisions influence the sound obtained from these calculations is difficult to assess .",
    "here we follow a different strategy which is related to the propagation of sound waves in potential flows , but differs from the above described method significantly .",
    "we do not separate the velocity into an irrotational part and a remainder but follow a path used by howe @xcite .",
    "he observed that bernoulli s equation states that the stagnation enthalpy differs from the potential only by a sign and by a time derivative . for irrotational sound waves one could therefore use the stagnation enthalpy instead of the potential .",
    "the stagnation enthalpy is however defined also for rotational flows and could be used as a variable of an acoustic analogy for arbitrary flows .",
    "this is what we will do .",
    "we will derive a convected wave equation for the stagnation enthalpy .",
    "we will discuss its main properties and show that it possesses many of the formal properties of the ordinary wave operator .",
    "an important example is an energy conservation theorem with an energy density which is positive for subsonic flows .",
    "this excludes instabilities , the influence of small errors remains small .",
    "the provisions which are necessary in many other analogies to limit the troublesome growth of instabilities are not necessary here .      to obtain the equations for the acoustic analogy including convection effects ,",
    "one starts from the euler equation for compressible flow .",
    "crocco s form of these equations reads @xmath13 @xmath14 denotes the total enthalpy @xmath15 with the enthalpy @xmath16 and the velocity @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath17 is the temperature und @xmath18 the entropy . from the energy theorem one",
    "finds for the total enthalpy @xmath19 if one writes @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the derivative of the density with respect to the entropy , one gets from the continuity equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the mass flux .",
    "if one multiplies crocco s vortex theorem ( [ a1 ] ) with the density @xmath2 one obtains for the mass flux @xmath23 the equation @xmath24 it is easy to eliminate the mass flux @xmath23 from these equations .",
    "one then obtains an equation , which is linear in @xmath14 @xmath25 the operator @xmath26 obtained here agrees completetely with the operator @xmath27 given in the previous section for the propagation of irrotational sound waves .",
    "if one inserts the sources from the equations ( [ a3 ] ) und ( [ a4 ] ) , one finds @xmath28 the sources are linear expressions in the vorticity vector and the entropy . in this analogy",
    "one may think of the sound as being generated from vorticity and entropy inhomogeneities .    with acoustical applications in mind ,",
    "the total enthalpy was first used by howe @xcite and recently proposed also by doak @xcite .",
    "a comparison with their equations shows , that the equation for @xmath14 is not uniquely determined .",
    "howe s convected wave operator is @xmath29 and doak s @xmath30.\\ ] ] the right hand sides of these equations differ from the right hand side of eq.([a5 ] ) .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "notice however that the principle parts  i.e. those terms which contain second derivatives of @xmath14  of the three convected wave operators agree .",
    "this means that they agree in the high frequency limit of geometric acoustics and agree with the well known geometric acoustic theory .",
    "the equation ( [ a5 ] ) or ( [ a5a ] ) is a generalization of the wave equation .",
    "it reduces to the wave equation if one assumes in ( [ a5 ] ) @xmath32 and if one assumes further , that @xmath2 and @xmath33 are constant .",
    "the equation agrees then with lighthill s equation in the form of powell @xcite .",
    "it seems to be a rather complicated equation .",
    "considering a variational principle we will however see , that equation ( [ a5],[a5a ] ) is actually the simplest equation which contains a flow velocity .",
    "a simplification of the source is possible for an ideal gas . for an ideal gas @xmath2",
    "is the product of two functions which depend only on @xmath3 and on @xmath18",
    ". then one has @xmath34 with some function @xmath35 and one obtains for the sources of eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) @xmath36 if one makes use of the entropy conservation law",
    ".    the equation ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) rsp .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) are now considered as the basic equations of the acoustic analogy .",
    "they agree formally with the linearized equations which describe small perturbations of a steady potential flow .",
    "the zeroth order equations are then given by @xmath37 ( because of the bernoulli equation ) and @xmath38 , i.e. the zeroth order versions of the eqs .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) . the first order eqs . of ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] )",
    "are then obtained , if the fields @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are replaced by their zero order values .",
    "notice that @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) then becomes @xmath40 and it differs from @xmath23 which becomes @xmath41 . in that sense the left hand side of the eqs .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) rsp .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) are considered as equations which describe sound propagation in potential flows .",
    "this is very similar to lighthill s interpretation of the wave equation as an equation which describes sound propagation in a medium at rest .",
    "this interpretation is valid only if @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are steady fields which fulfill the equations for compressible irrotational flow .",
    "we will however not require this , as @xmath42 is also well defined without this assumption and there are no advantages in assuming it .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) rsp .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) are exactly valid identities .",
    "they are considered in the following as a system of linear partial differential equations for the variables @xmath14 and @xmath23 .",
    "this implies also that the right hand sides of the equations ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) rsp .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) are considered as the sources of the sound .",
    "they are related to vortices and entropy inhomogeneities .",
    "this seems reasonable if one wants to study the generation and propagation of sound in a potential flow .",
    "then the flow consists of a superposition of an irrotational steady part and an unsteady part .",
    "often one will superpose these two contributions linearly .",
    "we will not require that .",
    "for the steady flow one has a constant value of the total enthalpy @xmath14 .",
    "one may then assume @xmath14 to be zero .",
    "@xmath14 is then solely related to the unsteady part and is small if this part is small . in irrotational flow",
    "there is a potential @xmath43 .",
    "this obeys the bernoulli equation @xmath44 @xmath14 then differs in regions where the flow is irrotational from the temporal derivative of the potential only by its sign , it is however  contrary to the acoustic potential defined everywhere .",
    "this equation ( [ a5 ] ) was originally derived in @xcite .",
    "let us now derive its main properties .",
    "the first important point is that @xmath26 is formally self - adjoint .",
    "this follows from the fact that one has for arbitrary functions @xmath14 and @xmath45 the identity @xmath46 with @xmath47 this equation is easy to check .",
    "it implies also that one has for a scalar product @xmath48 defined by @xmath49 the relation @xmath50 if @xmath14 and @xmath45 vanish on the boundary of the integration region or decay sufficiently rapidly at infinity .",
    "one may derive from the symmetry in eq .",
    "( [ a7 ] ) a reciprocity relation .",
    "to be specific let @xmath51 be the green s function associated with @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath52 where we have assumed that @xmath53 is causal , i.e. it vanishes for all times before the source is switched on , which occurs at @xmath54 .",
    "there exists also an advanced green s function @xmath55 with @xmath56 it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) is invariant with respect to time reversal @xmath57 if at the same time the sign of the velocity is reversed .",
    "therefore time reversal transforms a green s function into a green s function . as the time reversal interchanges the inequalities @xmath58and @xmath58 one has @xmath59 where we have added for clarity the function @xmath60 to the list of arguments of the green s function .",
    "in addition the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 have to be replaced by @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ".    one may now apply eq.([a7 ] ) with @xmath65 and one obtains @xmath66 let us indicate briefly that there are no contributions from the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ b0 ] ) . if the integration in eq .",
    "( [ b4 ] ) is performed over a large cylinder in the @xmath67,@xmath68-space which extends over a large sphere in @xmath67-space and over all @xmath68 with @xmath69 , one has surface contributions which are to be evaluated over the large sphere at @xmath70 and at @xmath71 and over the surface of the large sphere in @xmath67-space for all @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath72 is before @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 after @xmath73 and @xmath74 there are no contributions from the space integrals at @xmath70 and at @xmath71 , as at least one factor vanishes in @xmath76 and in the @xmath77 , namely the factors containing @xmath55 at @xmath71 and those containing @xmath53 at @xmath70 .",
    "there is also no contribution from the large surface in @xmath78-space if it is selected so large that no signal which was generated at @xmath54 and at @xmath79 has reached this surface .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ b4 ] ) is true , and one can evaluate the scalar products with the @xmath80-functions in the eqs .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) easily , and one obtains the equation @xmath81 which can with eq .",
    "( [ b3 ] ) be rewritten as @xmath82 this is the reciprocity principle with reversed flow .",
    "it seems very remarkable that this variational principle seems to be the simplest possible extension of the well known principle for the wave equation which is invariant with respect to galilei - transformations .",
    "the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ a8 ] ) differs from the lagrangian of the wave equation only by the fact , that partial derivatives with respect to time are replaced by material derivatives formed with the velocity field @xmath5 .",

    "an energy conservation law , if the lagrangian density does not depend explicitly from the time .",

    "the energy theorem is then of the form @xmath98 with an energy density @xmath97 and an energy source densitye @xmath99 .",
    "a useful relation is obtained if one integrates this equation over the time for finite time events or if one averages this equation for the case of steady phenomena .",
