    "one of the most abundant oxides in natural silicates and technological silicate glasses is al@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "although alumino silicates are therefore of central interest in geosciences and materials science , the structure even of the binary system sio@xmath0al@xmath0o@xmath1 is far from being well  understood .",
    "however , the knowledge of the chemical ordering in the latter system provides also the basis for a better understanding of the structure of more geologically relevant alkali or alkaline earth alumino  silicates .    the chemical ordering of aluminium is very complicated when built into the tetrahedral si ",
    "o network . in order to achieve local charge neutrality ,",
    "al@xmath5 ions need a different environment of o@xmath6 ions than si@xmath7 ions .",
    "thus , unlike sio@xmath0 , al@xmath5 ions do not form a network of alo@xmath3 tetrahedra that are connected with each other via the o atoms at the corners . instead , different experimental techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) [ lee and stebbins , 2000 ; schmcker _ et al .",

    "_ , 2005 ] found evidence for structural units such as three ",
    "fold coordinated oxygen atoms and five and six  fold coordinated aluminium atoms that are not found in pure silica , unless one considers amorphous silica at very high temperatures , say above 4000k ( see horbach and kob , 1999 ) .    at low al@xmath0o@xmath1 concentrations ,",
    "the al atoms are mainly four  fold coordinated by oxygens , but , as proposed in nmr studies , these alo@xmath3 units are accompanied by so  called triclusters , i.e.  structural units where an oxygen atom is surrounded by three cations ( where at least one of them is an al atom ) .",
    "recently , molecular orbital calculations confirmed the possibility of such triclusters ( kubicki and toplis , 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , a combination of molecular dynamics computer simulations and hartree  fock calculations ( tossell and cohen , 2001 ; winkler _ et al . _ , 2004 ; tossell and horbach , 2005 ) found evidence that o tricluster atoms participate typically in two  fold rings ( i.e.  edge  sharing geometries ) of composition al@xmath0o@xmath0 or alsio@xmath0",
    "certainly , further experimental studies are necessary to clarify to what extent triclusters and edge  sharing tetrahedra exist in real aluminium silicates .    as shown by recent nmr studies , five and six  fold coordinated al atoms are also important structural units in the system sio@xmath0al@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the fraction of these highly coordinated al atoms tends to increase with increasing al@xmath0o@xmath1 concentration ( sen and youngman , 2004 ; stebbins _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) .",
    "all these experimental findings show that , in alumino silicates , the local chemical ordering of al atoms is very different from that of si atoms .    in a recent md simulation study of the system ( al@xmath0o@xmath1)2(sio@xmath0 ) [ abbreviated in the following as as2 ]",
    ", we have shown that the different chemical ordering of al and si on local length scales also leads to structural ordering on intermediate length scales of the order of 1 nm ( winkler _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) .",
    "this intermediate range order ( iro ) can be described by a microphase separation where the al  rich network structure percolates through the si  o network .",
    "the iro gives rise to a prepeak in partial static structure factors at a wave number @xmath8@xmath4 .",
    "it can be seen as a precursor of the metastable liquid ",
    "liquid phase separation below @xmath9k that is found experimentally ( macdowell and beall , 1969 ) between about 10mol% and 50mol% ( as2 , with 33mol% al@xmath0o@xmath1 , lies approximately in the center of the demixing region ) .",
    "the formation of iro seems to be quite a general feature of multicomponent silicate melts .",
    "similar iro as the one found in as2 has also been seen in neutron scattering experiments of a calcium silicate ( gaskell _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ) , sodium silicates ( meyer _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ; meyer _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) , and alkali aluminosilicates ( cormier _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ; kargl and meyer , 2005 ) . for the example of sodium silicates ,",
    "the iro is reflected in a prepeak around 0.9@xmath4 in static structure factors .",
    "it has its origin in the formation of sodium  rich channels in the static structure .",
    "these channels serve as preferential pathways in an immobile si ",
    "o matrix and thus provide an explanation for the high mobility of sodium in ion  conducting sodium silicate melts ( horbach _ et al . _ , 2002 ; meyer _ et al . _ , 2004 ) .",
    "the presence of diffusion channels in sodium silicates is a nice example for the interplay between structure and mass transport in glassforming melts .",
    "the structure  transport relation is also a central issue of the present study .",
    "we have extended our previous simulations of as2 to aluminium silicates with 13mol% al@xmath0o@xmath1 and 47mol% al@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "these systems are simulated at different densities to see how pressure affects the structural and dynamic properties of aluminium silicates .",
    "furthermore , we aim to understand how the interplay between local structural features ( triclusters , two  fold rings , five and six  fold coordinated al ions ) and iro changes with composition .",
    "this is in turn will allow us to elucidate the interplay between structural features and transport processes , when we investigate the temperature dependence of the selfdiffusion constants for the different systems under consideration .",
    "as in our recent study of as2 , we use a potential proposed by kramer _",
    "et al . _  ( 1991 ) to model the interactions between the atoms .",
    "it is based on the so  called bks potential ( van beest _",
    "et al . _ , 1990 ) for pure silica that has been extensively applied in recent studies ( see , e.g. , horbach and kob , 1999 , and references therein ) . apart from mixtures of sio@xmath0 with al@xmath0o@xmath1 , the kramer potential allows also the consideration of sodium silicates .",
    "as shown recently , it provides quite a realistic description of sodium di , tri and tetra  silicate ( ispas _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ; meyer _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) as well as of as2 ( as far as comparison with experimental data is possible , see also below ) [ winkler _ et al .",

    "the concept of a `` distance  dependent al charge '' should not be taken too literally .",
    "we just introduce an additional short  ranged potential to the original one , with a cut  off at @xmath41 .    the exponential function in eq .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) it becomes obvious that at small distances the potential between the al ( or si ) and the o atoms goes to minus infinity ( since the coefficients @xmath51 are positive ) , i.e.  it becomes unphysical .",

    "at this temperature , one can estimate an ambient pressure density around 2.45g/@xmath63 for our simulation model and thus , in the case of the a65s73 model , the density is about 10% smaller than in the corresponding real system .",
    "in this section , structural properties of the models of a29s197 and a65s73 are investigated .",
    "the central issue is to elucidate the interplay between the local chemical ordering around the al atoms and the iro that we have recently encountered in a simulation study of as2 ( winkler _ et al . _ , 2004 ) .",
    "as we have already mentioned in the introduction , the local structure of amorphous aluminium silicates has been investigated by various experimental techniques .",
    "in particular , nmr experiments yield detailed information about the al  o coordination and the occurrence of triclusters .",
    "all these experiments have been done at room temperature , i.e.  well below the experimental glass transition temperature @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , a direct comparison of , e.g. , nmr results with those from a computer simulation is not very meaningful , since the glass structures from a md simulation have a very different thermal history than the experimental ones ( which is due to the much shorter time scale that is accessible in a simulation ) .",
    "all one can do is to extrapolate the properties of fully  equilibrated samples at high temperatures ( in this study above 2000k ) to temperatures at which the system would fall out of equilibrium on the typical experimental time scale .    keeping this issue in mind",
    ", we discuss now the temperature dependence of the al  o coordination in the a29s197 and a65s73 models for different coordination numbers @xmath79 . the coordination number @xmath80 is defined as the number of o atoms surrounding an aluminium atom within a distance @xmath81 . for @xmath82 ,",
    "we have chosen 2.32 , which corresponds to the location of the first minimum in the partial pair correlation function of the al  o correlations .",
    "note that @xmath82 is significantly larger than the mean distance between an al and an o atom which is @xmath83  for our model system .",
    "but this difference between @xmath82 amd @xmath84 is normal for a melt structure where the relatively large width of the first peaks in the pair correlation function is due to structural disorder and the thermal motion of the atoms .",

    "logarithmic plot as a function of inverse temperature for @xmath86 .",
    "we have not included the results for @xmath87 since six  fold coordinated aluminium atoms are quite rare , i.e.  not more than 2% of them are found in each of the considered systems . from our data",
    "it is hard to extrapolate to lower temperatures since none of the curves can be described by an arrhenius law ( a straight line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) over a large temperature range .",
    "it might even be that , e.g. , the curves for @xmath88 exhibit a maximum at large values of @xmath89 , or those for @xmath90 a minimum .",
    "at least it seems that three ",
    "fold coordinated al atoms disappear at low temperature whereas one may expect a significant fraction of five  fold coordinated al atoms also at low temperature , in particular in the hd a65s73 system",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that for a29s197 , as well as for a65s73 , most of the al atoms are four  fold coordinated by o atoms .",
    "since five and six  fold coordinated al atoms are relatively rare , we expect a large number of triclusters of the form o3(si , al ) in order to yield charge neutrality in the local environment of al atoms . and indeed , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , the number of triclusters o3(si , al ) per al atom is of the order of one in the whole temperature range that is considered for the different systems .",
    "the minimum in the curves for a29s197 around 3000k can be easily explained by a closer inspection of the data . at high temperature , triclusters with only one or no al atom are the most frequent ones .",
    "but their number strongly decreases with decreasing temperature , whereas the number of triclusters with two or three al atoms increases with decreasing temperature , thus leading to the minima in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b displays the number of two  fold rings ( i.e.  edge  sharing tetrahedra ) as a function of temperature . clearly , there are about 0.4 two  fold rings per al atom at low temperature .",
    "most of the two  fold rings contain two al atoms ( about 6080% ) or one al and one si atom ( about 2040% ) .",
    "the fraction of edge  sharing sio@xmath3 tetrahedra is for all the considered systems of the order of 1% or smaller ( of course , this holds only at low temperatures ) .",
    "the o atoms of the two  fold rings are most likely also triclusters , in agreement with our previous study ( winkler _ et al .",

    "oxygen distance ( note that @xmath134  corresponds approximately to the location of the first minima in the partial pair correlation function of si  o and al  o correlations ) .",
    "apart from the peak at @xmath135 , in @xmath136 and @xmath137 , a pronounced prepeak is found around @xmath138@xmath4 , whereas in @xmath139 , such a prepeak is absent .",
    "this behavior of the different concentration  concentration functions is similar to our recent result for as2 .",
    "there , we have related the prepeak to a microsegregation into al ",
    "o rich and si  o rich regions on the length scale of about 1 nm . indeed , in the snapshots of figs .  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ]",
    ", one can clearly identify al  o rich percolating regions in the si  o network .",
    "it is remarkable that the location of the prepeak at @xmath140 seems to depend neither on the al  o concentration nor on the pressure ( at least for the pressures that are observed at the two densities considered for each system ) .",
    "this finding is contrary to the behavior of structural features on local length scales where we have found a strong dependence on temperature , pressure , and al@xmath0o@xmath1 concentration ( see above ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath91 from scattering experiments is very difficult since it requires the measurement of partial structure factors @xmath102 . for silicates ,",
    "this has been possible only for a few examples , e.g.  a calcium silicate glass ( gaskell _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ) . in the case of aluminium silicate glasses ,",
    "total structure factors have been measured for different compositions using x ",
    "ray scattering by morikawa _",
    "et al . _  ( 1982 ) and by okuno _ et al . _  ( 2005 ) .",
    "their results can be directly compared to simulation data . to this end ,",
    "an x  ray scattering structure factor @xmath141 has to be calculated from the partial structure factors , @xmath102 , by weighting them with x  ray form factors , @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "the form factors @xmath144 depend on the wavenumber @xmath145 via @xmath146 .",
    "note that the @xmath144 are taken from the literature ( international tables , 1974 ) .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the `` reduced '' x  ray structure factor @xmath147 in comparison to experimental results . as we recognize from the figures a good agreement",
    "is obtained between simulation and experiment both for a29s197 and a65s73 . for the latter system ,",
    "two experimental data sets are available and , as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig6]b , the simulation curve is closer to the more recent result of okuno _ et al . _  ( 2005 ) .    as we can infer from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , no prepeak is visible around 0.5@xmath4 in the reduced x  ray structure factor .",
    "note that this is also the case for @xmath141 itself .",
    "this is due to the fact that the main contribution to @xmath141 comes from @xmath148 which does not exhibit a prepeak at 0.5@xmath4 .",
    "also in neutron scattering experiments , one has no access to partial structure factors for aluminium silicates ( due to the lack of appropriate isotopes ) .",
    "thus , the accessible total structure factor is dominated by the o  o correlations and will hardly show a prepeak .",
    "it remains a challenge to the experimentalists to verify the presence of the latter prepeak in aluminium silicates .",
    "we have seen that the considered aluminium silicates exhibit a chemical ordering on length scales of about 1 nm which can be described by a microphase separation into an al rich and a si rich network structure . in our recent study of as2 ( winkler _ et al .",
    "_ , 2004 ) , we have shown that the addition of al@xmath0o@xmath1 to a silica melt enables a much faster selfdiffusion of all components compared to pure sio@xmath0 .",
    "this is also the case for a29s197 and a65s73 which we consider here . in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a , the selfdiffusion constants of our systems ( for the ld samples ) are displayed on a semilogarithmic scale as a function of inverse temperature .",
    "clearly , the diffusion constants increase with increasing al@xmath0o@xmath1 concentration ( note that the diffusion constants of as2 fall between the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a , as expected ; see winkler _",
    "et al . _ , 2004 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig7]b , the oxygen diffusion constants @xmath149 are shown , now also with the results for the hd systems .",
    "we can infer from this figure that an anomalous behavior of @xmath149 with respect to pressure emerges : the diffusion becomes faster with increasing pressure .",
    "this anomaly is well  known in many different `` simple '' network forming glasses such as sio@xmath0 , h@xmath0o , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , shell _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 and references therein ) . for sio@xmath0",
    ", this anomaly has been related to structural changes that occur with increasing pressure ( angell _ et al .",
    "_ , 1982 ; kubicki and lasaga , 1988 ; rustad _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ; barrat _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ) : the network structure changes gradually from a four  fold coordination of silicon atoms at low pressure to an imperfect five  fold coordination at intermediate pressure and eventually to a six  fold coordination at very high pressure ( note that in the latter regime the selfdiffusion constants decrease with increasing pressure ) .",
    "intuitively , the anomalous diffusion can be understood as follows : in the tetrahedral network structure there are not as many possibilities for the formation of local defects as in a higher  coordinated network .",
    "since these defects facilitate diffusion in a network structure ( see , e.g. , horbach and kob , 1999 ) , the particles in a higher  coordinated network tend to exhibit a faster diffusion than in a tetrahedral network .",
    "but what are the defects that facilitate the diffusion in the al@xmath0o@xmath1sio@xmath0 networks ?",
    "important structural units might be triclusters and five  fold coordinated silicon atoms , both of which are more frequent in the hd systems ( see above ) .",
    "thus , they might be responsible for the higher diffusion constants , as compared to the ld systems .",
    "as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig7]a , silicon is the slowest component and aluminium the fastest component of the diffusing species . in order to quantify the temperature dependence of the different diffusion constants , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the ratios @xmath150 and @xmath151 as a function of temperature for the different systems .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath150 depends only weakly on density and composition ( note that also @xmath150 for bks ",
    "sio@xmath0 would fall roughly on top of the corresponding curves in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , see winkler _ et al . _ , 2004 ) .",
    "this shows that the diffusion of silicon and oxygen is intimately connected with each other . on the other hand , @xmath152 nearly approaches the constant value of one in a65s73 in the considered temperature range ( at least for the hd system ) .",
    "this might be due to the fact that in the al@xmath0o@xmath1 rich system , a65s73 , oxygen diffusion steps occur mainly in the vicinity of al rich regions , in particular near triclusters , whereas in a29s197 , also the o diffusion in the slow si rich regions is important .",
    "this issue has to be clarified in future studies .",
    "large scale molecular dynamics computer simulations were used to study the structure and diffusion dynamics of the aluminium silicates a29s197 and a65s73 .",
    "the microscopic interactions between the ions were described by a simple pair potential proposed by kramer _ et al . _",
    "( 1991 ) . in this work",
    ", we have demonstrated that this model potential yields good agreement with available experimental data such as the mass density and the x  ray structure factor .",
    "however , recent nmr experiments ( sen and youngman , 2004 ; stebbins _ et al . _ , 2005 ) observed a significant number of six  fold coordinated al atoms already at small al@xmath0o@xmath1 concentrations .",
    "by contrast , our simulation model predicts a vanishing number of alo@xmath153 units in the glass structure .",
    "this might be realistic for a29s197 but not for the al  rich a65s73 system . in the case of five",
    " fold coordinated al atoms , an extrapolation from the melt data to the experimental glass transition temperature is not easy ( see above ) .",
    "however , as a typical local structure , we find tricluster o atoms in conjunction with two  fold rings .",
    "recent hartree  fock calculations that used small clusters from our recent md simulation of as2 , found evidence that the combination of triclusters with two  fold rings is indeed realistic ( tossell and horbach , 2005 ) . it should be emphasized that this finding refers only to binary alumino silicates .",
    "the local structure may be very different in ternary alumino silicates that contain also charge  balancing cations such as calcium or alkali ion species .",
    "the different local ordering of al and si atoms leads to a microsegregation on length scales of about 1 nm .",
    "this structural feature is reflected in a prepeak in static concentration ",
    "concentration correlation functions ( and also in partial static structure factors ) .",
    "the location of the prepeak is around 0.5@xmath4 , independent of al@xmath0o@xmath1 concentration , pressure , and the details of the local structure in the considered systems .",
    "this remarkable result shows that according to our simulation model , the formation of al rich channels that percolate through the si  o network is a central feature of the chemical ordering in the system al@xmath0o@xmath1sio@xmath0 .",
    "this is a prediction of our simulation that could be tested by scattering experiments .",
    "prepeaks in other silicates , that have a similar origin as the one found in our aluminium silicate models , have been successfully identified in recent neutron scattering experiments ( see gaskell _",
    "et al . _ , 1991 ; meyer _ et al . _ , 2002 ; meyer _ et al . _ , 2004 ; kargl and meyer , 2005 ) .",
    "our analysis of the diffusion dynamics suggests that triclusters are important for the mass transport in aluminium silicates .",
    "moreover , we have found subtle differences in the dependence of the three diffusion constants on temperature ( e.g.  the ratio @xmath152 is essentially one for the hd a65s73 system , while it increases in the case of the a29s197 systems ) .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether these features can be understood in the framework of mode coupling theory .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
