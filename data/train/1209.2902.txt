    "the formfactors of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) are well defined objects which can be studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "we will focus on several basic quantities which are connected with @xmath1 meson and summarize basic status of their theoretical calculations mainly at low energies , i.e. at the domain of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "the formfactors connected for example with kaons will not be considered here , but one should note that they play also important role in connection with chpt ( e.g. @xmath2 ) .",
    "the most simplest formfactor , pion decay constant , is defined in qcd via the coupling of axial current and pion as @xmath3 as the pion is real , @xmath4 , the momentum dependence is trivial and @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "this is a reason why it is usually not referred as formfactor in the literature ( on recent review see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is a fundamental order parameter of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath6 to @xmath7 of qcd ( @xmath8 represents number of light quark flavours , 2 or 3 for real qcd ) .",
    "its value can be set from the @xmath9 decay using marciano and sirlin formula for radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "updated by virtual photons @xcite and @xmath10 value @xcite one can obtain @xcite @xmath11 in pure qcd , @xmath12 and @xmath13 difference is nnlo effect and this was evaluated in @xcite and found to be indeed very small .",
    "we use this fact in order to set the pion decay constant form @xmath0 lifetime . using the nnlo calculation within chpt of @xmath14 decay @xcite",
    "subtracting qed corrections one can arrive to @xmath15 as an experimental input the primex measurement was used @xcite .",
    "we can see that the precision obtained here can not still compete with the precision obtained using charged pion decay .",
    "however new experimental activity ( e.g. primex2 , kloe - ii ) can improve the experimental error .",
    "on the theory side there are also possible improvements foreseen .",
    "one of them , the full calculation of the @xmath16 decay will be valuable @xcite , as well as a better estimation of the value of the isospin breaking coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "what is important to stress at this moment is that possible tension between these two values  ( [ fpi1 ] ) and  ( [ fpi2 ] ) can be attributed to new physics : @xmath5 , determined from the weak decay of the @xmath18 assumed the validity of the standard model . a possible deviation from it via right - handed currents was opened in @xcite .",
    "vector or more precisely electromagnetic formfactor of the charged pion , @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20\\,.\\ ] ] its calculation within chpt up to two - loop level can be found in  @xcite and using dispersive treatment in @xcite .",
    "data within the validity of chpt were taken so far mainly from a space like region ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "new measurements in a time - like region almost down to the di - pion threshold ( at kloe10 @xcite ) urge us to answer the question of validity of chpt more precisely . for this",
    "we will turn to the calculations of the leading logarithms .    _",
    "leading logarithms _ ( ll ) are logarithms with highest possible power at the given order .",
    "similarly as in the renormalizable theory they can be calculated using only one - loop diagrams @xcite . in the renormalizable theory",
    "their summation has an important phenomenological consequence : the running coupling constant .",
    "in effective theory , as chpt , the ll coefficients are given only by the form of the leading - order lagrangian .",
    "they are thus parameter - free and without further knowledge of low - energy constants can be used as a rough estimate of the given order . however , the general method for their summation is not known and thus at the moment we must rely only on some simplify cases where it was possible .",
    "ll were calculated up to the fifth order in the massive @xmath21 model ( for @xmath22 it is equivalent to two - flavour chpt ) in @xcite . in the massless and large @xmath23 limit",
    "it is indeed possible to resum all ll , the closed form is ( cf .",
    "also @xcite , but mind the sign ) @xmath24\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath25 the calculated ll together with the resummed function is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     in massless and large @xmath23 limit in @xmath26 model.,width=396 ]",
    "it is clear that convergence in the time - like region is already problematic not far above the threshold .",
    "it also shows how important is a resum function ( at least in the studied limits ) .",
    "let us note that even ll are very important in studying the convergence , the actual numerical value is still dominated by the large higher - order coefficients @xcite .",
    "the definition reads @xmath27 its calculation within chpt exists up to next - to - next - to - leading order in  @xcite .",
    "the fact that this quantity can not be practically measured today can appear as a problem .",
    "however , using @xmath28 phase shifts and the dispersive treatment @xcite we can study its energy dependence .",
    "writing @xmath29 one would obtain @xmath30 these values were recently used in the new global fit of low energy constants of the 3-flavour chpt @xcite .",
    "the pion decay @xmath31 ( see e.g. works in @xcite ) is interesting in the context of the qcd formfactors because its structure dependent part dominates over the inner bremsstrahlung due to the helicity suppression .",
    "the structure dependent part , connected to the pionic structure , can be further decomposed to the vectorial ( @xmath32 ) and axial ( @xmath33 ) part . beyond standard model",
    "one can consider also tensor radiation part ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "as there is no significant hint from the recent measurements  the most precise limits are @xmath35 set by the pibeta group @xcite  we will not consider it here .",
    "the vector part of the @xmath36 structure , defined as ( @xmath37 for simplicity ) @xmath38 and @xmath39 amplitude , defined as @xmath40 can be connected employing an isospin symmetry @xmath41 the recent measurement @xcite @xmath42 is in agreement with the value obtained either from @xmath43 decay width or @xmath44 theoretical calculation .",
    "this value was also used as an independent determination of the neutral pion lifetime ( see also @xcite ) @xmath45 however , one should be careful with systematic uncertainties . as we have mentioned the connection between @xmath46 and @xmath39",
    "is based on the isospin symmetry .",
    "it also means that the value of the mass of pion in  ( [ fvapigg ] ) is just matter of convention .",
    "the dependence on the actual value is source of roughly 50% of the error in ( [ taupsi ] ) .",
    "independently of @xmath47 decay , the isospin - breaking corrections were found to be very important also in the theoretical estimate of @xmath43 decay width @xcite .",
    "the transition pion - gamma - gamma ( all off - shell ) formfactor is a quantity accessible via a definition of the qcd green function of the vector - vector and pseudoscalar currents @xmath48 |0\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] using ward identities and lorentz and parity invariance we can extract @xmath49 the formfactors can be obtained using the lsz .",
    "e.g. for the @xmath0 transition formfactor we have ( for simplicity in the chiral limit ) @xmath50 the application of this object is very wide . the most important place where its theoretical behaviour is most desired is probably the hadronic light - by - light contribution in muonic anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "putting a pion on shell we can consider two regions depending on a photon virtuality : space - like ( represented e.g. by the @xmath51 fusion to @xmath0 ) and time - like region ( e.g. @xmath52 ) . on the more detailed overview and literature",
    "see the recent mesonnet workshop @xcite .",
    "the area of the applicability of chpt is demonstrated on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .     as a function of a virtual photon , calculated using ll only ( up to 6-loop order ) [ e.g. @xmath53 , @xmath54 . for comparison : vector meson dominance curve ( vmd).,width=302 ]    we clearly see that area is roughly @xmath55 for both time - like and space - like @xmath56 .",
    "unfortunately this region is not yet very well covered by experimental data . in the following",
    "we will discuss both regions in more detail .",
    "apart from the model - independent ll we must employ some specific model and parameters in order to describe behaviour of the objects as defined for example in  ( [ ffpigg ] ) at low energies .",
    "in pure chpt we have to deal with low - energy constants . for",
    "@xmath57 these are mainly @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the odd - intrinsic - parity sector @xcite .",
    "they must incorporate the existence of resonances and their effect even below their thresholds ( as it is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . we will be , however , still limited with the applicability of such models strictly below these resonances . on the other hand , one can enlarge chpt by resonances and keep them as active degrees of freedom . for the mentioned odd sector",
    "this was studied systematically in @xcite .",
    "generally , the base or lagrangian of the lowest lying resonances for @xmath60 gives complicated result with many parameters .",
    "using the operator - product expansion they are reduced just to two parameters .",
    "this verifies the so - called lmd+p ansatz @xcite . for the on - shell pion",
    "we have only one parameter left and this can be set using transition form factor .",
    "another way how to set this parameter is to use the information on @xmath61 decay .",
    "however , the experimental error of this value is still big",
    ". nevertheless one can use it as a consistency check and it seems in good agreement @xcite .",
    "the second parameter , which is connected with the off - shell pion can be obtained from information on @xmath62 and @xmath63 . however , here the experimental situation is even worse .",
    "fortunately , there is at least one experimental information from belle : limit on @xmath64 @xcite .    to summarize using the phenomenological information ( from the space - like region ) we may set all relevant parameters within resonance chiral theory and make some non - trivial predictions .      in the time - like region the transition formfactor @xmath65 is mainly connected with the dalitz decay @xmath66 ( see recent @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for the needs of the low - energy region it is convenient to study only a slope parameter @xmath67 : @xmath68 having the experimental data one should extract first the qed corrections : @xmath69\\,.\\ ] ] these qed corrections are well understood @xcite and they include now also one - photon irreducible contributions .",
    "its value @xmath70 should be subtracted from the two relevant experiments @xcite .",
    "the central value would shift to the excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction @xmath71 however , one should note that huge experimental errors ( more than 100% ) make the comparison meaningless .",
    "we have studied some basic properties of the pion formfactors at low energy . we have first briefly discussed pion decay constant @xmath5 and set possible inconsistency in this value obtained using @xmath9 and @xmath72 . on the next object , electromagnetic formfactor of charged pion",
    "we have demonstrated use of the so - called leading logarithms in studying the convergence .",
    "short overviews on scalar formfactor and radiative pion decay were also given .",
    "last but not least , @xmath73 transition formfactor was discussed both for time - like and space - like region .",
