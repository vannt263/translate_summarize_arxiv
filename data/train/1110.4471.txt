    "the variability of the emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with relativistic jets viewed at small angles is amplified because of the doppler boosting @xmath6 .",
    "this measurement can be linked to the size of the emitting region @xmath7 , which should be smaller than @xmath8 , being @xmath9 the observed characteristic time scale , @xmath10 the speed of light , and @xmath11 the redshift of the source .",
    "rather obviously , very short time scales imply very small emitting regions .",
    "when the size @xmath7 is smaller than the gravitational radius of the central black hole ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the gravitational constant and @xmath14 is the mass of the singularity ) , this can create some problems in blazar models ( cf @xcite ) . according to the present models ,",
    "the dissipation region of jets in blazars is at about @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite ) . by taking into account",
    "that any perturbation propagate with a starting size of the order of the gravitational radius and the jet is a self - similar structure  which in turn implies that the emitting region is linked to the distance from the central black hole @xmath16 through the aperture of the jet @xmath17 ( e.g. @xcite )  the dissipation at @xmath18 requires an emitting region of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "such a size can sustain a variability of about @xmath20  hours in the case of a blazar at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the observation of sub - hour time scales in the high - energy emission from some blazars ( @xcite ) threatened this scenario .",
    "although a simple increase of the doppler factor could be an affordable gross solution in the case of bl lac objects ( which have a photon - starved nearby environment ) this is no more reasonable for flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , with a richer photon field .",
    "since the external energy density is proportional to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the bulk lorentz factor ) , an increase of @xmath6 implies an increase of the energy density and , hence , of the optical depth for pair production ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "particularly , the observation of variability with time scales of minutes at hundreds of gev in the case of pks  1222@xmath0216 @xcite has put very severe constraints to the existing models ( see @xcite for a review and some possible solutions ) .    therefore , the search for short time scales in the emission of fsrqs is an insuperable testing ground for the existing theories about relativistic jets . the launch of the large area telescope ( lat , @xcite ) onboard the _ fermi _ satellite made it available the state - of - the - art of the high - energy @xmath1-ray instrumentation . with its superior performance , it is now possible to probe the variability in fsrqs on hourly time scale .",
    "some work has been already published in @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the case of pks  1222@xmath0216 as observed by _",
    "fermi_/lat and reanalyzed the data presented in @xcite with a most recent and improved version of the software .",
    "the fsrq pks  1222@xmath0216 ( a.k.a .",
    "4c  @xmath021.35 ) is a high - power blazar at @xmath26 .",
    "it was listed in the catalog of very high energy ( @xmath27  gev ) sources detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat ( in a time period of about two years ) @xcite . in 2010 april - june ,",
    "the source underwent a few strong @xmath1-ray outbursts , with fluxes at energies greater than 100  mev in excess of @xmath2  ph  @xmath3  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "particularly , on 2010 june 17 , it was detected at energies of hundreds of gev by the magic cerenkov telescope , while displaying very short time scale variability ( @xmath28  minutes , @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of _",
    "fermi_/lat data in the period 2010 april - june revealed short variability : @xmath29  hours or @xmath30  hours , with a more conservative approach @xcite .",
    "this analysis was performed by using a pre - flight version of the instrument response function ( irf ) , adapted to overcome some problems in the @xmath31  mev energy range .",
    "after the publication of the work @xcite , the _ fermi_/lat collaboration released ( 2011 august 5 ) a new fully post - flight irf , together with improved files for the background subtraction . given the importance of this release , we decided to reanalyze the lat data , searching for tighter estimates of the time variability .",
    "therefore , in this work , we adopt the lat science tools v. 9.23.1 , with the irf p7source_v6 , and background files iso_p7v6source.txt ( isotropic ) and gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits ( galactic diffuse ) .",
    "we selected events of class 2 , within a zenithal distance of @xmath32 and a rocking angle smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "the time period covered by the analysis is the same of @xcite , i.e. 2010 april 29 ( mjd 55315 ) and june 20 .",
    "the remaining of the analysis has been done as described in @xcite , i.e. by building a light curve with the width of bins equal to the good - time - intervals ( gti ) .",
    "then , we searched for the time scale @xmath9 for doubling / halving the flux as defined by :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the fluxes at times @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",

    "it is worth noting that the magic observation refers to 2010 june 17 @xcite .",
    "the two events ( april 30 and june 17 - 18 ) are not necessarily correlated or similar . it is not possible to know if on april 30 the source extended its emission to hundreds of gev , because magic started observing pks  1222@xmath0216 on may 3 @xcite . however , the spectral analysis of _",
    "fermi_/lat data suggests that the emission drops after a few tens of gev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] , red star points ) .",
    "the photon with highest energy detected by lat at that time measured @xmath48  gev .",
    "instead , the spectrum measured during the flare of 2010 june 17 - 18 ( blue squares in fig .  [ fig : sed ] ) seems to extend to match the magic measurements of @xcite , with the highest energy of lat photons of @xmath49  gev .",
    "particularly , in the last _ fermi _ bin ( @xmath50  gev ) , the source is detected with high significance ( @xmath51 , equivalent to @xmath52 ) .",
    "the partial drop in flux as observed in the two @xmath53  gev and @xmath54  gev bins can be consistent with an absorption within the blr according to the theory of poutanen & stern @xcite , as already noted in @xcite .",
    "from the variability alone , the two flares of 2010 april 30 and june 17 - 18 seem similar , with the time scales consistent each other within the errors .",
    "the value of @xmath55  hour favors the dissipation in the blr ( cf .",
    "sect .  3 and eqs .  3 and 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , the spectral analysis revealed two different states of the source : one ( 2010 april 30 ) with a spectrum peaking around @xmath56  hz and with no detection above a few tens of gev ; the other ( 2010 june 17 - 18 ) has a harder spectrum extending to hundreds of gev , although partially absorbed in the range @xmath57  gev .",
    "it seems that most of the dissipation generally occurs in the blr , but sometimes there are episodes where the region is at larger distances from the central spacetime singularity , nearby the infrared torus ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of an outward motion of the dissipation zone has been already suggested by stern & poutanen @xcite by studying 3c  454.3 . in this case , the motion would be on a larger scale , from the blr to the infrared torus .    perhaps , this is the solution of the long - standing question on where @xmath1-rays are produced , which has seen several researchers debating during the past years mainly on two opposite arrays : on one side , the two groups led by marscher @xcite and sikora @xcite , respectively , favoring the hypothesis of a location nearby the infrared torus , i.e. on super - pc scales ; on the other side , a more heterogeneous group supporting the sub - pc location , within the blr @xcite .",
    "the combined spectral and variability analysis presented in this work suggests that it is not a matter of _ either _ one _ or _ the other hypothesis ( _ aut - aut _ ) , but that _ both _ hypotheses are possible in the same source , depending on the time of the event . that is",
    ", the dissipation occurs _ both _ in the blr _ and _ in the infrared torus . generally in the blr , but sometimes the blob is only partially absorbed by the blr and can move outward still sufficiently collimated and dissipate nearby the torus .",
    "_ added on february 13 , 2012 : _ the recent preprint by nalewajko et al .",
    "@xcite casted some doubts on our measurements of the characteristic time scales for doubling / halving the fluxes .",
    "indeed , we discovered an error , which led to an underestimate of @xmath9 .",
    "we have now corrected the error and we thank nalewajko et al . for having",
    "pointed it out .",
    "it is worth noting that this error does not affect the concepts expressed in the present work ."
