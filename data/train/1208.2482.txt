    "in fact , davies @xcite and barrow @xcite have suggested a total entropy , i.e. , the sum of the entropy on the horizon and the classical entropy generated by the bulk viscous stresses , to discuss the generalized second law of event horizon thermodynamics .",
    "that is , in the present entropic cosmology , we focus on the entropy on the horizon , neglecting the classical entropy discussed above .",
    "we now examine the friedmann equation . in bulk viscous cosmology , the friedmann equation @xcite is given by @xmath282 equation  ( [ eq_bulk_frw1 ] ) does not include an additional term such as a cosmological constant . on the other hand , in entropic cosmology , the friedmann and acceleration equations have additional driving terms , which are derived from",

    "however , an additional term appears in the acceleration equation for bulk viscous cosmology .",
