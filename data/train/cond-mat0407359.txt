    "model hamiltonians used in the study of correlation effects in solids have a coulomb interaction term in a site - centered atomic - like orbital basis set which is not explicitly defined . when the correlated electrons are well localized , as , for example , 4@xmath6-states of rare - earth ions , atomic orbitals ( or atomic sphere solutions like muffin - tin orbitals ) are a good choice",
    ". however , the most interesting problems occur in the regime of metal - insulator transitions , where the states of interest become partially itinerant and rather extended .",
    "the error of using atomic orbitals is most severe in the case of materials with strong covalency effects , like late transition metal oxides , where partially filled bands are formed by the mixture of metallic @xmath7-orbitals and oxygen p - orbitals .",
    "for example , in high - t@xmath8 cuprates correlated states have the symmetry of cu-3@xmath7 @xmath9 orbitals , but are actually zhang - rice singlets formed by the combination of oxygen p - states centered around the cu ion and having @xmath9 symmetry .    in model calculations",
    "the problem of defining the correlated orbitals is not very important , because it only affects model parameter values , which in any case are considered fitting parameters .",
    "however any attempt to construct an `` _ ab initio _ '' calculation scheme requires an explicit definition of the basis set for the coulomb interaction term .",
    "an important requirement for such a choice is that the orbitals must produce the partially filled bands where coulomb correlations occur while preserving the localized , site - centered atomic - like form .",
    "these requirements are fulfilled for wannier functions ( wfs ) @xmath10 defined as a fourier transformation of the bloch functions @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "here and below functions are labeled with band index n , lattice translation vector * t * and wave vector * k*.    when there is more than one band crossing the fermi level , wfs are not uniquely defined .",
    "any * k*-dependent unitary transformation @xmath12 of the set of bloch functions @xmath11 for these bands produces a new set which can be used for the calculation of wfs via fourier transformation ( eq .",
    "[ psi_def ] , sec .",
    "[ w_def ] ) .",
    "if one imposes the requirement that the wfs should have the symmetry of atomic orbitals  @xcite , this unitary transformation is well defined .",
    "the explicit form of the wfs allows one to compute coulomb interaction parameters in constrained local density approximation ( lda ) calculations .    in this way the parameters for the _ ab initio _ many - body hamiltonian ( non - interacting hamiltonian @xmath1 and coulomb interaction ) in the wf basis can be computed by any first principle electronic structure calculation scheme ( below we use the lmto method ) .",
    "this hamiltonian can then be further investigated by one of the methods developed in the many - body community . in the present work we use the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )",
    "@xcite . within dmft",
    ", the effective impurity problem corresponding to the many - body hamiltonian is solved by quantum monte - carlo simulations ( qmc )  @xcite .",
    "the dmft part of the proposed calculation scheme is essentially the same as the one used in the recently developed lda+dmft approach  @xcite for the _ ab initio _ investigations of correlated electron materials  @xcite .",
    "however , here we propose a more general procedure to compute the green function using the hamiltonian matrix and an integral over brillouin zone instead of the hilbert transform of the lda density of states ( dos ) .",
    "this particular method allows one to avoid the uncontrollable errors occuring in the computation of the green function using the hilbert transform of the lda dos .",
    "thus , to obtain an insulating solution we need to cut off the long ( metal - oxygen ) hybridization tails of the dos , renormalize it and shift the fermi energy to get an integer filling . in the present method we overcome the above - mentioned difficulties owing to the integer filling of wannier orbitals .",
    "the result of the dmft calculations is a local self - energy operator @xmath13 . in our scheme",
    "this operator is defined in the wf basis set @xmath14 and is acting in the subspace of partially filled bands which are used for the construction of the wfs .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ method ] the details of our scheme are presented . in sec .",
    "[ w_def ] we describe the construction of wfs , as well as the _ ab - initio _ hamiltonian matrix within this basis set in terms of bloch functions . in sec .",
    "[ wf_gf ] we propose a general method for the construction of wfs using the green function @xmath15 , which reduces to the results of sec .",
    "[ w_def ] in the non - interacting case .",
    "the reason for doing so is that the correlation effects can significantly renormalize the electronic states of the partially filled bands .",
    "hence the wfs computed from non - interacting bloch states are not an optimal choice for the basis set any more . in sec .",
    "[ wf_dmft ] we discuss how to calculate within dmft the local green function with the input of the hamiltonian matrix in wf basis set instead of the lda dos ( which is valid only in the case of degenerate bands ) . in sec .",
    "[ self - cons ] we show that the self - energy operator within the wf subspace , which is the solution of the correlation problem , can be transformed back into the full - orbital hilbert space , thus enabling the computation of the full interacting green function @xmath16 .",
    "it can then be used to calculate the spectral , magnetic and electronic properties of the system under investigation .",
    "in addition , to make the calculation scheme fully self - consistent , one can employ the @xmath15 to calculate the correlation affected charge density and thus the new lda potential . thereby the feedback from dmft to lda can be incorporated in a well - defined way .",
    "this is actually one of the great advantages of using the wf basis since in the lmto basis the feedback from dmft to lda is essentially uncontrolled . in sec .",
    "[ results ] the results for the electronic structure of the two vanadium oxides srvo@xmath4 and v@xmath5o@xmath4 obtained by the method developed in this work are presented and compared with the previous calculations by the simpler methods and new bulk - sensitive spectra .",
    "finally in sec .  [ conclusion ]",
    "we close this work with a conclusion .",
    "let us consider the general case of the electronic structure problem .",
    "for the lda hamiltonian @xmath0 we have a hilbert space of eigenfunctions ( bloch states @xmath17 ) with the basis set @xmath18 defined by particular methods ( e.g. , lmto  @xcite , or linearized augmented plane waves ( lapw )  @xcite , etc . ) . in this basis",
    "set the hamiltonian operator is defined as @xmath19 here and later greek indices are used for full - orbital matrices .",
    "if we consider a certain subset of the hamiltonian eigenfunctions , for example bloch states of partially filled bands @xmath11 , we can define a corresponding subspace in the total hilbert space .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix is diagonal in the bloch states basis .",
    "however , physically more appealing is a basis set which has the form of site - centered atomic orbitals .",
    "that is a set of wfs @xmath20 defined as the fourier transformation of a certain linear combination of bloch functions belonging to this subspace ( see below ( [ wf_psi ] ) ) .",
    "the hamiltonian operator @xmath1 defined in this basis set is @xmath21 the total hilbert space can be divided into a direct sum of the above introduced subspace ( of partially filled bloch states ) and the subspace formed by all other states orthogonal to it .",
    "those two subspaces are decoupled since they are the eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix in the wf basis ( i.e. , a collection of the bases of the specific subspaces ) is block - diagonal so that the matrix elements between different subspaces are zero .",
    "the block matrix @xmath22 in ( [ ham_genwf ] ) corresponding to the partially filled bands can be considered as a projection of the full - orbital hamiltonian operator ( [ ham_gen ] ) onto the subspace defined by its wfs .",
    "all this concerns the non - interacting ( or lda ) hamiltonian . to treat coulomb correlations",
    "one also needs a definition of the localized orbitals where the electrons interact .",
    "wfs are a natural choice for such a definition .",
    "this choice leads to an important flexibility in the size of the basis set in the sense that the number of wfs can be changed by changing the set of bloch bands considered .",
    "the simplest case is a set of partially filled bands , for example the @xmath23-bands of vanadium oxides .",
    "this is a physically justified approximation because the coulomb interaction happens mainly between electrons ( or holes ) in the partially filled bands .",
    "if the problem to be solved concentrates on the excitation spectrum in a small energy window around the fermi level , this basis set is sufficient .",
    "however , if the excitations to higher lying states ( real or virtual ) are also important , the set of bloch bands used to construct the wfs need to be extended so that the coulomb interaction will be treated in a larger hilbert subspace .",
    "practically this means that the correlation problem is solved using a non - interacting few - orbital hamiltonian @xmath1 ( [ ham_genwf ] ) instead of the full hilbert space hamiltonian @xmath0 ( [ ham_gen ] ) .",
    "the interaction matrix elements of the model hamiltonian can be determined from constrained lda calculations for the specific wf basis set ( [ u_wf ] ) .",
    "projecting the full orbital hilbert space hamiltonian @xmath0 ( [ ham_gen ] ) onto the subspace of the partially filled bands gives us a few - orbital hamiltonian @xmath1 ( [ ham_genwf ] ) .",
    "this significantly decreases the complexity of the correlation problem , thus permitting its explicit solution .",
    "the many - body problem with a hubbard interaction then leads to a local self - energy operator @xmath24 which is naturaly defined in the basis of wfs centered on the same site : @xmath25-dependent projection matrix between the full orbital basis set and the orthonormalized wfs ( [ coef_wf_bloch ] ) .",
    "the definition ( [ sigma_gen ] ) allows one to convert the self - energy matrix @xmath26 back to the full hilbert space basis set ( subsection  [ self - cons ] ) . with this the interacting green function",
    "can also be calculated in the full - orbital hilbert space ( subsection  [ wf_gf ] ) .",
    "the concept of wfs has a very important place in the electron theory in solids since its first introduction in 1937 by wannier @xcite .",
    "wfs are the fourier transformation of bloch states @xmath17 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of discrete @xmath29 points in the first brillouin zone ( or , the number of cells in the crystal ) .",
    "these extremely convenient orthogonal functions were widely investigated in the seventies @xcite .",
    "the strongly localized nature of the wfs together with all advantages of the atomic functions makes them a very useful tool where the atomic character of the electrons is highlighted .",
    "thus , using the wf method , significant progress was achieved in the fields of narrow - band superconductors , disordered systems , solid surfaces , etc .",
    "several methods for calculating wf for single and multiple bands in periodic crystals , and their generalization to non - periodic systems were proposed .",
    "the problem of non - unique definition of wfs in these methods was resolved by an iterative optimization of trial functions which have the same real and point group symmetry properties as wfs . among these methods ,",
    "there are the variational koster - parzen principle @xcite which was generalized by kohn @xcite , the general pseudopotential formalism proposed by anderson @xcite , and the projection operator formalism by cloizeaux @xcite .",
    "however , all these computational schemes are restricted to simple band structures .",
    "wannier functions are not uniquely defined because for a certain set of bands any orthogonal linear combination of bloch functions @xmath17 can be used in ( [ wf_psi_def ] ) . in general",
    "it means that the freedom of choice of wannier functions corresponds to freedom of choice of a unitary transformation matrix @xmath30 for corresponding bloch functions @xcite : @xmath31 the resulting bloch function @xmath32 will generally not be an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian but has the meaning of a bloch sum of wannier functions ( see below @xmath33 in ( [ wf_psi ] ) ) .",
    "there is no rigorous way to define @xmath30 .",
    "this calls for an additional restriction on the properties of wfs . among others marzari and vanderbilt @xcite proposed the condition of maximum localization for wfs , resulting in a variational procedure to calculate @xmath30 .",
    "to get a good initial guess the authors of @xcite proposed choosing a set of localized trial orbitals @xmath34 and projecting them onto the bloch functions @xmath17 .",
    "it was found that this starting guess is usually quite good .",
    "this fact later led to the simplified calculating scheme proposed in @xcite where the variational procedure was abandoned and the result of the aforementioned projection was considered as the final step .",
    "the approach of @xcite has recently been used for the investigation of the row of 3@xmath7 transition metals ( fe , co , ni , and cu ) within the simplest many - body approximation , namely the unscreened hartree - fock approximation @xcite .    another possibility to construct wfs was recenly developed by andersen @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "they proposed the nth - order muffin - tin orbital ( nmto ) scheme in which wannier - like low - energy mtos can be designed _",
    "a priori_. using a new implementation of the lda+dmft approach they performed an investigation of the mott transition in orthorhombic 3@xmath36 perovskites @xcite . in this approach",
    "a realistic hamiltonian constructed with wannier orbitals ( on symmetrically orthonormalized nmtos ) was solved by dmft , including the non - diagonal part of the on - site self - energy .",
    "our projection procedure works as follows .",
    "first of all one needs to identify the physically relevant bands which will then be projected onto a wf basis .",
    "for example , in perovskites one usually takes the partially filled @xmath7-shell or some particular @xmath7-bands of transition metals , since they are mainly responsible for the physical properties of the system  @xcite . these orbitals are well - separated and are , in our approach , easily extracted from the full orbital space as will be shown later .",
    "moreover , the projection method is applicable even in the case where the bands of interest differ and are strongly hybridized ( for example , cu-3@xmath7 and o-2@xmath37 states in high - t@xmath8 superconductors  @xcite ) .    to project bands of particular symmetry onto the wfs basis",
    "one can select either the band indices of the corresponding bloch functions ( @xmath38 ) , or choose the energy interval ( @xmath39 ) in which the bands are located .",
    "non - orthogonalized wfs in reciprocal space @xmath33 are then the projection of the set of site - centered atomic - like trial orbitals @xmath34 on the bloch functions @xmath17 of the chosen bands",
    "( band indices @xmath40 to @xmath41 , energy interval ( @xmath39 ) ) : @xmath42 then the real space wfs @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 in the present work the trial orbitals @xmath34 are lmtos .",
    "note that in the multi - band case a wf in reciprocal space @xmath33 does not coincide with the bloch function @xmath11 due to the summation over band index @xmath45 in ( [ wf_psi ] ) .",
    "one can consider them as bloch sums of wfs analogous to the basis function bloch sums @xmath46 ( [ psik ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath47 in ( [ wf_psi ] ) define ( after orthonormalization ) the unitary transformation matrix @xmath30 in ( [ psi_def ] ) . however , the projection procedure defined in ( [ wf_psi ] ) is more general than the unitary transformation ( [ psi_def ] ) .",
    "namely , the number of bands @xmath48 can be larger than the number of trial functions . in this case the projection ( [ wf_psi ] ) will produce @xmath28 new functions @xmath49 which define a certain subspace of the original @xmath48-dimensional space .",
    "this subspace will have the symmetry of the set of trial functions . in the next subsection",
    "we propose a way to determine wfs from the green function of the system ( [ wf1 ] ) rather than from a set of bloch states as in ( [ wf_psi ] ) . in this alternative projection procedure ,",

    "finally , the coulomb matrix element @xmath93 needs to be calculated in the same wf basis .",

    "once the wfs have been recalculated ( for example in some self - consistent loop ) the interaction has to be recalculated as well .      in many - body theory the system is usually not described by bloch functions @xmath17 ( [ psi ] ) and their energies @xmath83 but by the green function @xmath96 the green function matrix @xmath97 is defined via the non - interacting hamiltonian matrix @xmath98 and the self - energy matrix @xmath99 ( [ sigma_full ] ) as @xmath100 we define non - orthonormalized wf obtained by projecting the trial orbital @xmath101 on the hilbert subspace defined by the green function ( [ green1 ] ) in the energy interval ( @xmath39 ) , namely , @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the non - interacting case , the self - energy operator @xmath104 is absent , and hence we have @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the eigenvectors ( [ coef ] ) , and @xmath83 are the eigenvalues of @xmath107 .",

    "<S> we propose a computational scheme for the _ ab initio _ calculation of wannier functions ( wfs ) for correlated electronic materials . </S>",
    "<S> the full - orbital hamiltonian @xmath0 is projected into the wf subspace defined by the physically most relevant partially filled bands . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian @xmath1 obtained in this way , with interaction parameters calculated by constrained lda for the wannier orbitals , is used as an _ ab initio _ setup of the correlation problem , which can then be solved by many - body techniques , e.g. , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) . in such calculations the self - energy operator @xmath2 is defined in wf basis which then can be converted back into the full - orbital hilbert space to compute the full - orbital interacting green function @xmath3 . using @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> one can evaluate the charge density , modified by correlations , together with a new set of wfs , thus defining a fully self - consistent scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the green function can also be used for the calculation of spectral , magnetic and electronic properties of the system . here </S>",
    "<S> we report the results obtained with this method for srvo@xmath4 and v@xmath5o@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons are made with previous results obtained by the lda+dmft approach where the lda dos was used as input , and with new bulk - sensitive experimental spectra . </S>"
