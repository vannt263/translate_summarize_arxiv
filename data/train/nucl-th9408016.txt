    "traditionally , nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) potentials are constructed by fitting @xmath3 data for @xmath7 states and either @xmath3 or @xmath2 data for @xmath8 states .",
    "examples of potentials fit to @xmath3 data in all states are the argonne @xmath1  @xcite , urbana @xmath1  @xcite , and most of the bonn potentials  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the reid  @xcite , nijmegen  @xcite , and paris  @xcite potentials were fit to @xmath2 data for @xmath8 channels .",
    "unfortunately , potential models which have been fit only to the @xmath3 data often give a poor description of the @xmath2 data  @xcite , even after applying the necessary corrections for the coulomb interaction . by the same token",
    ", potentials fit to @xmath2 data in @xmath8 states give only a mediocre description of @xmath3 data .",
    "fundamentally , this problem is due to charge - independence breaking in the strong interaction .    in the present work",
    "we construct an updated version of the argonne potential that fits both @xmath2 and @xmath3 data , as well as low - energy @xmath4 scattering parameters and deuteron properties .",
    "the strong interaction potential is written in an operator format that depends on the values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 of the @xmath6 pair .",
    "we then project the potential into a charge - independent ( ci ) part that has fourteen operator components ( as in the older argonne @xmath1 model ) and a charge - independence breaking ( cib ) part that has three charge - dependent ( cd ) and one charge - asymmetric ( ca ) operators .",
    "we also include a complete electromagnetic potential , containing coulomb , darwin - foldy , vacuum polarization , and magnetic moment terms with finite - size effects .",
    "we designate the new model argonne @xmath0 .    in a number of applications",
    "it is important for an @xmath6 potential to reproduce correct @xmath3 and @xmath2 scattering parameters .",
    "for example , in thermal neutron radiative capture on the proton , @xmath12 , it is crucial to have the correct singlet @xmath3 scattering length in the initial state to get the cross section .",
    "however , in low - energy proton weak capture , @xmath13 , it is equally important that the correct @xmath2 scattering length be provided by the interaction .",
    "clearly , a complete potential model should meet both requirements .",
    "another important application is in the formulation of three - nucleon ( @xmath14 ) potentials . in general , nuclei are underbound using only @xmath6 potentials fit to the scattering data .",
    "nontrivial many - nucleon interactions are expected to make up a portion of the missing binding energy .",
    "phenomenologically we may choose to construct a many - body hamiltonian , such as @xmath15 and constrain the strength parameters of the @xmath14 potential by requiring that @xmath16 gives the correct trinucleon binding energy .",
    "similar considerations apply if we choose a relativistic formulation .",
    "clearly , such constraints are ambiguous or even meaningless if the @xmath6 potential used in the calculations does not adequately describe the two - nucleon data . for @xmath17he ( @xmath17h ) ,",
    "in which the @xmath6 interaction underbinds by @xmath181 mev , there are two @xmath3 pairs and one @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) pair . to a good approximation",
    ", the two @xmath3 pairs will be in the @xmath19 , @xmath7 state 75% of the time , and in the @xmath20 , @xmath8 state 25% of the time , while the @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) pair will be pure @xmath20 , @xmath8 . if the chosen @xmath6 potential fits only the more repulsive @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) data in the @xmath8 state , we would get a smaller @xmath6 contribution to the binding energy and thus overestimate the @xmath14 potential strength required . by the same token , a model fit to @xmath3 data in the @xmath8 state would be too attractive and we would underestimate the @xmath14 potential",
    ". the difference can be as much as 0.4 mev , leading to variations in the @xmath14 potential strength of order @xmath21 .",
    "this would have significant effects in larger many - body systems .    because we include a complete electromagnetic potential and fit low - energy @xmath4 scattering data , the present model also can be used to study charge - symmetry breaking , as in the @xmath17h ",
    "@xmath17he mass difference  @xcite , or more generally the nolen - schiffer anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic potential is in principle well - known and is the longest - range part of the interaction .",
    "potential models commonly fit the deuteron energy to better than 1 kev accuracy . since we find that the electromagnetic terms give a non - negligible 18 kev repulsion in the deuteron and moderate shifts in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering lengths , we deem it desirable to include these terms explicitly .",
    "the major goal of the present work is to construct a nonrelativistic potential that can be used easily in nuclear many - body calculations and that accurately fits both @xmath2 and @xmath3 data .",
    "we adopt the local operator structure of the older argonne @xmath1 and urbana @xmath1 potentials , which have been used extensively in calculations of finite nuclei , nuclear matter , and neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the assumption of an underlying operator structure relates all partial waves in a simple manner , without imposing a one - boson - exchange ( obe ) form which might be too restrictive at short distances .",
    "recently , the nijmegen group has shown  @xcite that it is feasible to construct potential models which fit the @xmath6 data with the almost perfect @xmath5 per datum of 1 . however , these models differ in each partial wave and thus implicitly introduce nonlocalities from one partial wave to the next that may be difficult to characterize and treat accurately in many - body calculations . when they limit the potential to an obe form , which has a local operator structure ( save for a nonlocal part in the central potential ) describing all partial waves simultaneously , the @xmath5 per datum increases to 1.87 , albeit with a much smaller number of parameters .",
    "the present model is a compromise between these two approaches , adopting a phenomenological form ( unrestricted by an obe picture ) at short distances , but maintaining a local operator structure .",
    "the potential was directly fit to the nijmegen @xmath6 scattering data base  @xcite , which contains 1787 @xmath2 and 2514 @xmath3 data in the range 0350 mev , and has an excellent @xmath5 per datum of 1.09 .    in sec .",

    "are shown in table  [ deuteron ] and compared to experimental values  @xcite . the binding energy , @xmath168 , is fit exactly by construction .",
    "the expectation values for the kinetic energy , @xmath10 , and for the em , ope , and remaining potentials are also shown .",
    "we note that the ope potential dominates , while the em potential gives a small but non - negligible 18 kev contribution , mostly from the magnetic moment term .",
    "the asymptotic @xmath9-state normalization , @xmath169 , the @xmath170-ratio , @xmath162 , and the deuteron radius , @xmath171 , all come out close to the experimental values .",
    "the magnetic moment , @xmath172 , and the quadrupole moment , @xmath173 , are both underpredicted in impulse approximation ; both have significant relativistic and meson - exchange corrections , as discussed below . finally , the @xmath174-state percentage is about 5% smaller than that of the older argonne @xmath1 model  @xcite and almost identical to that of the paris potential  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9- and @xmath174-wave components of the deuteron wave function are shown in fig .",
    "[ figuw ] , where they are compare to those for the older @xmath1 model .",
    "the short - range behavior of the wave function components is moderately different .",
    "the @xmath175 and @xmath176 structure functions and tensor polarization @xmath177 obtained with the present interaction model are displayed in figs .",
    "[ figa][figt20 ] ; the experimental data is from refs .",
    "@xcite . the model for",
    "the isoscalar electromagnetic current operator has been discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , here we only summarize its general structure , which consists of one- and two - body parts .",
    "the one - body part has the standard impulse approximation ( ia ) form , with inclusion , in the charge component , of the darwin - foldy and spin - orbit relativistic corrections  @xcite .",
    "the two - body charge operators contain contributions that correspond ( in an obe picture ) to those obtained from pion- and vector - meson ( @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) exchanges .",
    "these are obtained from the nonrelativistic reduction of the born terms in the corresponding relativistic photoproduction amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the two - body current operators are constructed from the spin - orbit and quadratic momentum - dependent components of the interaction with the methods developed in refs .",
    "we also consider the two - body charge and current operators associated with the @xmath178 mechanism .",
    "in particular , we include in the nonrelativistic reduction of its current component the next to leading order correction arising from the tensor coupling of the @xmath159 meson to the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the hhler parametrization 8.2  @xcite is used for the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon , while an @xmath160-pole term form factor is included at the @xmath178 electromagnetic vertex .",
    "the calculated @xmath175 structure function is in excellent agreement with the experimental data over the whole range of measured momentum transfers .",
    "the darwin - foldy and spin - orbit relativistic corrections to the single - nucleon charge operator as well as the leading two - body charge contribution due to pion exchange play an important role , as it is evident from fig .",
    "however , these same contributions lead to a significant discrepancy between theory and experiment in the tensor polarization .",
    "this observable and the @xmath175 structure function are mostly sensitive to the charge and quadrupole form factors . in particular ,",
    "the momentum transfer at which the minimum of @xmath177 occurs is related to the position of the charge form factor zero .",
    "the relative shift between the predicted and experimental @xmath177 minima implies , therefore , a corresponding shift between the charge form factor zeros .",
    "the calculated @xmath176 structure function is found to overpredict the experimental data in the momentum transfer range 1045 @xmath93 , and has a zero around 60 @xmath93 .",
    "the leading two - body contributions are those due to the spin - orbit and quadratic spin - orbit components of the interaction .",
    "they are of opposite sign .",
    "however , the overestimate of the data indicates that the degree of cancellation between them is not quite enough .",
    "the @xmath178 current contribution is small over the momentum transfer range considered here ( we have used the rather soft cutoff values of 0.75 gev and 1.25 gev at the @xmath179 and @xmath180 vertices , respectively , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) at present , the two - body currents associated with the quadratic spin - orbit and @xmath181 components of the interaction are essentially obtained by minimal substitution @xmath182 { \\bf a}({\\bf r}_i)$ ] , where @xmath183 is the vector potential , @xmath184 and @xmath185 the isoscalar and isovector nucleon electric form factors  @xcite .",
    "it would be desirable to construct these current components in a more systematic way , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .    finally , the values for the quadrupole and magnetic moments obtained with the full charge and current operators are : @xmath186 @xmath187 and @xmath188 @xmath189 .",
    "the measured quadrupole moment is underestimated by roughly 4% , while the measured magnetic moment is overestimated by 1.5% .",
    "the two - body charge and current contributions amount to 2% and 3% increases of the ia values for @xmath173 and @xmath172 , as listed in table  [ deuteron ] .",
    "we have constructed a nonrelativistic @xmath6 potential with a local operator structure that gives an excellent fit to @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering data , as well as to low - energy @xmath4 scattering and the deuteron binding energy .",
    "we have projected the potential into charge - independent , charge - dependent , and charge - asymmetric pieces . in @xmath7",
    "many - body systems only the ci part of the potential will contribute , while the ca part will contribute in systems with @xmath190 and the cd part for @xmath191 systems . because of the isotensor projection , the ci part automatically has the correct average of @xmath192 @xmath2 ( or @xmath4 ) and @xmath193 @xmath3 @xmath8 interaction in the trinucleons , thus serving as a correct reference point for building @xmath14 potentials .",
    "the ca part will contribute to the energy differences of mirror nuclei ( the nolen - schiffer anomaly  @xcite ) , while the cd part will contribute to the splitting of isobaric analog states , e.g. , in the @xmath194 nuclei .",
    "studies of these effects are in progress .",
    "we have also computed the deuteron electromagnetic properties in both impulse approximation and with relativistic and exchange - current corrections .",
    "the least satisfactory prediction of the potential is the small value for @xmath195 , even after corrections are added .",
    "the full 4% discrepancy between the predicted and empirical @xmath195 values is unlikely to be resolved by additional relativistic and/or two - body corrections not included in the present calculation .",
    "similar low values were found by the nijmegen group in their recent fits  @xcite , which used rather different potential forms than the present model .",
    "we are less concerned about the 1.5% error in the magnetic moment or the overprediction of the @xmath196 structure function because of the uncertainties in the exchange currents discussed above .",
    "the @xmath54 structure function is very well reproduced , while the experimental tensor polarization @xmath197 still has rather large error bars above 10 @xmath198 .",
    "compared to the older argonne @xmath1 potential , the present model has a weaker tensor force , which will generally lead to more binding in light nuclei and less rapid saturation in nuclear matter .",
    "this is counteracted by the weaker attraction in @xmath8 @xmath6 states because of the mix of @xmath2 and @xmath3 components .",
    "initial calculations of few - body nuclei with the @xmath0 model show a slight net reduction in the binding energies of @xmath17h and @xmath199he compared to the @xmath1 model .",
    "another feature of the new model is a moderately greater attraction in @xmath200 waves .",
    "few - body nuclei are not sensitive to this part of the @xmath6 interaction .",
    "however , preliminary calculations  @xcite of the binding energy of @xmath201o show a significant improvement in the relative stability of @xmath201o and @xmath199he , which has been a persistent problem  @xcite .",
    "we believe the argonne @xmath0 potential has an promising future for use in microscopic nuclear many - body theory .",
