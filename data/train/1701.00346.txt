    "spin chains play an important role in many branches of physics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , solvable and/or integrable cases have received much attention  @xcite . recently , a new class of exactly solvable spin chains has been proposed .",
    "they are deeply related to combinatorial problems such as the enumeration of lattice paths .",
    "one example is an integer - spin chain studied in  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is 2-local and translationally invariant in the bulk .",
    "the exact ground state can be expressed as a uniform superposition of colored motzkin paths by identifying paths with spin configurations .",
    "many properties of the ground state , including entanglement and magnetization , have been studied  @xcite .",
    "further , it was shown that the model exhibits critical behavior , i.e. , the spectral gap scales polynomially with the inverse of the system size .",
    "a one - parameter deformation of the model was introduced and studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the model undergoes a quantum phase transition when the deformation parameter @xmath5 is varied .",
    "the exponential gap scaling of the model at @xmath1 was proved in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some topological properties of the model were studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "another model which has a similar combinatorial interpretation is a fredkin spin chain @xcite .",
    "the model describes half - integer spins and a local interaction among three neighboring spins .",
    "the interaction is frustration - free , i.e. , the ground state minimizes each interaction term .",
    "it has been proved that the unique ground state of the fredkin chain is a uniform superposition of colored dyck paths .",
    "note that in terms of the number of colors @xmath6 , the spin quantum number is expressed as @xmath7 .",
    "for the colorless ( spin-@xmath8 ) case , the entanglement entropy of the ground state scales as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is half the system size .",
    "when the color degrees of freedom are included , it scales as @xmath11 . in either case",
    ", the ground state does not obey an area law .",
    "this together with the contraposition of hastings theorem  @xcite implies that the model is gapless for all @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , the finite - size gap of the fredkin chain is polynomially small in the system size , as proved by movassagh in ref .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a one - parameter deformation of the fredkin chain whose ground state is a weighted superposition of colored dyck paths was proposed .",
    "the deformation is characterized by @xmath5 and the original fredkin chain corresponds to the case @xmath13 .",
    "the behavior of the von neumann ( entanglement ) entropy of half chain depends on both @xmath5 and the number of colors @xmath12 in a complicated way .",
    "when @xmath14 , the entanglement entropy obeys an area law , irrespective of the value of @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , the entanglement entropy for @xmath1 and @xmath15 also obeys an area law . on the other hand , when @xmath1 and @xmath16 , the entanglement entropy is tightly bounded by @xmath17 , implying the volume - law scaling and high entanglement .",
    "therefore , the model with @xmath16 exhibits a quantum phase transition from an area - law to a volume - law entanglement in the ground state .    in this paper , we study various properties of the deformed fredkin chain , particularly focusing on the case @xmath1 .",
    "the first is a spectral gap which is identical to the energy of the first excited state since the ground - state energy is zero .",
    "the contraposition of hastings theorem  @xcite again proves that the model is gapless when @xmath1 and @xmath16 .",
    "however , this argument alone does not specify how fast the finite - size gap decays with the system size .",
    "furthermore , this does not tell us whether the system is gapped or gapless for the colorless case ( @xmath15 ) with @xmath1 . in this work , by a variational method , we obtain an upper bound for the spectral gap and prove that the finite - size gap @xmath18 is at most exponentially small in the system size @xmath19 , namely , @xmath20 .",
    "the second is the magnetization .",
    "we show that the magnetization is along the @xmath2-direction at any site .",
    "in addition , we find that the @xmath2-component of the magnetization , say @xmath4 , exhibits a domain - wall structure , in which @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) holds for almost all sites in the left- ( right- ) half system .",
    "thirdly , we study various entanglement properties .",
    "the entanglement entropy of half of the chain in the deformed fredkin chain was evaluated in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we present a more thorough analysis on the entanglement .",
    "we study the schmidt rank , entanglement and rnyi entropies for any bipartition of the chain into two subsystems .",
    "we derive upper and lower bounds for the entanglement entropy and show that the ground state for @xmath1 obeys an area law when @xmath15 , while it obeys a volume law when @xmath16 .",
    "we also calculate the entanglement spectrum and show for large system sizes that the entanglement energy per site is equidistant at low energies , which is reminiscent of the spectrum of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we explain the model and its ground state .",
    "we then give a lemma and a theorem for the schmidt coefficients which will be used frequently in the sequel . in section 3 ,",
    "we prove that the spectral gap is upper bounded by @xmath20 . in section 4",
    ", we show that the magnetization is along the @xmath2-direction , and estimate the expectation value of @xmath23 . in section 5",
    ", we evaluate the schmidt rank , entanglement and rnyi entropies , and entanglement spectrum for any bipartition of the chain .",
    "section 6 is the conclusion . in appendices , numerical results for the finite - size gap and the estimates of some constants used in the main text",
    "are shown .",
    "here we explain the deformed fredkin spin chain which was introduced in ref .  @xcite .      . , width=264 ]    the deformed fredkin spin chain is deeply related to lattice paths . for clarity ,",
    "we first consider the spin-@xmath8 case corresponding to the colorless case .",
    "we regard local up- and down - spin states as @xmath24 and @xmath25 steps , respectively . in the following , we call @xmath24 and @xmath25 as up ( @xmath26 ) and down ( @xmath27 ) steps , respectively . and",
    "@xmath28 are used interchangeably . ] with this identification , any spin configuration maps to the corresponding lattice path ( as an example see figure [ notdyck ] ) . to treat more general cases",
    ", we introduce color degrees of freedom . for the spin-(@xmath7 ) case",
    ", we assign a color @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) to the state whose @xmath31 component is @xmath32(@xmath33 )",
    ". then we identify a local spin @xmath34 state with a @xmath35 step with color @xmath29 . with this identification , any spin configuration in the spin-(@xmath7 ) chain maps to the corresponding colored path .",
    "we now introduce the notion of colored dyck paths .",
    "they are a subset of colored paths that connect the coordinates @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "more precisely , the definition is as follows . a path on @xmath19 steps",
    "is called a colored dyck path iff ( i ) it starts at @xmath36 and ends at @xmath37 with steps @xmath24 and @xmath25 , ( ii ) it never goes below the @xmath38-axis , and ( iii ) matched steps in the path have the same color .",
    "an example of colored dyck paths is shown in figure [ dyck ] .",
    "note that we say that a pair of up and down steps is _ matched _ when these steps face each other , such as those connected by arrows shown in figure [ dyck ] .",
    "the bijection between colored paths and spin configurations maps each colored dyck path to the corresponding spin configuration .",

    "here , @xmath53 is the area between the path @xmath54 and the @xmath38-axis .",

    "( [ gs ] ) , the sum of these states is annihilated by the projection @xmath57 . this occurs for any three consecutive sites and the same goes for @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , @xmath59 annihilates the ground state eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath60 ensures that matched steps have the same color and identical dyck paths with different coloring have the same weight .",
    "further , @xmath61 penalizes paths which go below the @xmath38-axis .",
    "therefore , the state ( [ gs ] ) is indeed a zero - energy ground state .",
    "it is also easy to check that the ground state is unique : any other superposition of paths violates at least one of the projectors and has non - zero energy .",
    "let us first introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath62 be the set of paths which consist of @xmath63 pairs of up - down steps and @xmath64 extra up steps .",
