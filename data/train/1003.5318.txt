    "_ fermi _ observations of grbs provide a new probe of particle acceleration in the relativistic outflows of grbs .",
    "some generic features of the high - energy behavior of 10 large area telescope ( lat ) grbs consisting of 8 long - soft and 2 short - hard grbs at the time of this conference have been identified , as summarized by omodei @xcite .",
    "these are :    1 .   a delayed onset of the @xmath0 mev radiation observed with the lat compared with the start of the kev / mev gbm radiation ; 2 .",
    "long - lived lat emission extending well after the gamma ray burst monitor ( gbm ) radiation has fallen below background , as known previously for long duration grbs from egret @xcite ; 3 .",
    "existence of a distinct hard spectral component in addition to a component described by the band function in both long and short grbs , confirming the discovery of such a component from joint batse / egret tasc analyses @xcite .    in this contribution , the possibility that these features can be explained by uhecrs in grbs is considered . because protons and ions are weakly radiative compared to electrons , even with escaping energies @xmath1 ev needed to explain uhecrs , large amounts of nonthermal hadronic energy are required .",
    "we consider energetics arguments to constrain models for uhecrs from grbs .",
    "bohdan paczyski , in his seminal article on hypernovae @xcite , proposed an explanation for the large apparent isotropic energies of grbs by appealing to the enormous energy available in the process whereby the core of a massive star collapses to form a long grb .",
    "he noted that the @xmath2 m@xmath3 core of a type ii supernovae carries @xmath4 erg of rotational energy , which could be tapped through blandford - znajek processes if surrounded by a highly magnetized torus formed during the stellar collapse event .",
    "paczyski s arguments suggest that the maximum energy available from core collapse supernovae is therefore @xmath5 with perhaps an order - of - magnitude less in the coalescence events thought to form the short hard grbs .",
    "the association of long - duration grbs with type ib / c rather than type ii supernovae does not alter his energetics argument , but the recognition that grbs are jetted greatly reduces the absolute energy requirements .",
    "energy extracted through blandford - znajek processes is likely beamed in view of the rapid rotation of the newly formed black hole .",
    "even so , we can still apply the energy bound given by eq .",
    "( [ cale ] ) to determine the plausibility of models with large energy requirements .",
    "the idea that grbs could accelerate uhecrs was proposed by waxman @xcite and vietri @xcite in 1995 , and subject to criticism on energetics grounds @xcite , though here related to whether grbs within the gzk radius have the requisite volume- and time - averaged luminosity density .",
    "we can reformulate their argument in light of new data .",
    "the auger results show that the differential energy density of uhecrs at @xmath6 ev is @xmath7 erg @xmath8 .",
    "the horizon distance for @xmath9 ev uhecr protons is @xmath10 mpc ( shorter than the mean - free - path of @xmath11 mpc , because this is the distance from which protons with measured energy @xmath12 originally had energy @xmath13 ) , so that the required emissivity to power @xmath14 ev uhecrs is @xmath15 erg @xmath8/50 mpc @xmath16 erg mpc@xmath17 yr@xmath18 . if uhecrs are protons , then @xmath19 erg mpc@xmath17 yr@xmath18 , with @xmath20 , is required to power @xmath21 ev uhecrs , noting that the exponentially decreasing horizon distance with energy approximately cancels the @xmath22 decrease in uhecr energy density over this energy range .    with long - duration grbs taking place about twice per day over the full sky for batse - type detection capabilities @xcite , and are found at a typical redshift of unity , implying a local space density for unbeamed sources of @xmath23\\approx 0.3(\\zeta/0.1)$ ] gpc@xmath17 yr@xmath18 , consistent with the value of @xmath24 gpc@xmath17 yr@xmath18 found in more detailed treatments @xcite . here",
    "@xmath25 accounts for the smaller star - formation activity occurring at @xmath26 than at the present epoch @xcite .",
    "if each grb releases an amount of energy @xmath27 in uhecrs , then the local volume- and time - averaged cosmic - ray emissivity is @xmath28 mpc@xmath17 yr@xmath18 . equating this with the emissivity required to power",
    "the uhecrs implies that each grb must release @xmath29 erg in uhecrs .",
    "this can be compared with the typical electromagnetic energy release per grb of @xmath30 erg @xmath31 erg , where @xmath32 erg @xmath33 is the average batse long - duration grb fluence .",
    "thus the energy released in uhecrs has to be @xmath34 the energy measured from electromagnetic processes , independent of beaming .",
    "the need for large baryon loads in grb blast waves is confirmed by detailed fits to the uhecr energy spectrum , which imply a factor @xmath35  100 times more energy in uhecrs than observed in electromagnetic radiation @xcite .",
    "an explanation for the rapid declines in _ swift _ x - ray light curves in terms of escaping uhecr neutrons from photohadronic production also requires highly baryon - loaded grb outflows @xcite .",
    "a @xmath36-function approximation for the @xmath37 opacity constraint , given the detection of a @xmath38-ray photon with energy @xmath39 and variability time @xmath40 , implies a minimum bulk lorentz factor @xmath41^{1/6}\\;\\;,\\;\\ ; \\hat { \\epsilon}= { 2\\gamma^2\\over ( 1+z)^2{\\epsilon}_1}\\;. \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 flux at photon energy @xmath44 .",
    "thus @xmath45^{1/6}$ ] , where the @xmath43 flux is @xmath46 erg @xmath33 s@xmath18 , using values corresponding to time bin b for grb 080916c @xcite .",
    "this grb , at redshift @xmath47 and luminosity distance @xmath48 cm , had a total 10 kev  10 gev energy fluence @xmath49 erg @xmath33 , implying a total @xmath38-ray energy release @xmath50 erg .",
    "provided the target photon number spectrum has an index softer than @xmath51 , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) gives a result within @xmath2% of a numerical integration over spectral parameters .",
    "issues in the evaluation of the uncertainty , @xmath52 , in the value of @xmath53 include ( 1 ) uncertainties in redshift and @xmath43 spectral flux ; ( 2 ) the definition of variability time @xmath40 ; ( 3 ) the cospatial assumption that the target photons are made in the same region as the high - energy photon ; ( 4 ) the assumed geometry and dynamical state @xcite of the emission region , giving the escape probability of a high - energy photon ; ( 5 ) statistical fluctuations for the detection of a high - energy photon that furthermore depend on the actual high - energy photon spectrum .",
    "writing the grb blast wave lorentz factor @xmath54 , a consideration of these various issues show that @xmath55 represents a reasonably conservative expectation for the actual value of @xmath56 .",
    "the energetics of a given model can depend strongly on @xmath56 .",
    "the total apparent energy release of grb 080916c is @xmath57 , with @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding deceleration length is @xmath59 cm , where @xmath60 is the coasting lorentz factor and @xmath61(@xmath8 ) is the external medium density .",
    "the implied radius for internal shock emission is @xmath62 cm . the unexpectedly large emission radius , close to the deceleration radius when @xmath63 , has led a number of researchers to argue that the lat radiation originates from leptonic synchrotron radiation at an external forward shock @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the delayed lat emission results from upscattered cocoon radiation @xcite .",
    "we can make some simple estimates to deduce the total energy needed to obtain bright hadronic @xmath38-ray emission from grbs through proton synchrotron and photopion processes @xcite . here",
    "we consider only uhecr proton acceleration , using parameters appropriate to grb 080916c .    the internal photon energy density @xmath64 , where @xmath65 erg @xmath33 s@xmath18 is the measured energy flux , @xmath66 is the shock radius , and @xmath67 is a fiducial timescale ( corresponding to @xmath40 for internal shocks , or the grb duration for an external shock ) . writing the magnetic - field energy density @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , then the magnetic field in the emission region of grb 080916c is @xmath70 .",
    "the hillas criterion whereby the larmor radius @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the comoving shell width , implies that the escaping uhecr proton lorentz factor @xmath73 . for grb 080916c",
    ", this relation implies that uhecrs can be accelerated to @xmath74 , independent of time ( note that @xmath75 , with the divergence at @xmath76 prevented due to the time dependence of @xmath77 ) , or to energy @xmath78 ev .",
    "a further restriction on the maximum proton energy is obtained by balancing the acceleration rate , given by @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , with the synchrotron loss rate .",
    "this gives @xmath81 , comparable to the value obtained above from the hillas condition for the chosen parameters .",
    "the proton synchrotron energy loss timescale , as measured by an observer , is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "the typical photon energy ( in @xmath84 units ) of the measured proton synchrotron emission is @xmath85 $ ] , where @xmath86 g is the critical magnetic field . from this , one obtains the jet power associated with the magnetic field , given by @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the absolute energy requirements are @xmath88 erg , where @xmath89 is a beaming factor . in the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite , the delayed onset corresponds to the time for protons to accumulate and cool such that they are radiating most of the proton - synchrotron photons near energy @xmath90    such large energies disfavor this interpretation for the lat radiation . to salvage the proton synchrotron model @xcite , a narrow jet opening angle of order @xmath91 along with a value of @xmath92 gives @xmath93 @xmath94 erg , within acceptable ranges .",
    "another way to avoid the large energy losses is to suppose that the uhecr protons are accelerated to their allowed maximum energy and radiate proton synchrotron photons that cascade to energies @xmath95 mev .",
    "this possibility seemed unlikely given that the spectrum of grb 080916c is consistent with a single band function @xcite .",
    "the detection of distinct components in grb spectra suggests that a cascading interpretation be more carefully considered @xcite .",
    "proton - photon interactions making secondary pions , @xmath38 rays , and neutrinos represents another likely channel for making a @xmath38-ray component identifiable in the _ fermi _ data .",
    "the efficiency for extracting the energy of a proton with escaping energy @xmath96 from photohadronic processes can be written as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the dynamical time scale , the rate for photohadronic energy losses is @xmath99 , and the comoving photon spectrum @xmath100 , with @xmath101 . here",
    "@xmath102b above threshold photon energy defined by @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "defining protons with energy @xmath104 which interact at threshold with photons with energy @xmath105 at the peak @xmath106 of the @xmath43 spectrum , then @xmath107 ev .",
    "one obtains @xmath108 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath109 is the @xmath43 index above @xmath110 , so that @xmath111 when @xmath112 , and @xmath113 . likewise in the asymptotic limit @xmath114 , @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the @xmath43 index at energies below the peak energy ( provided @xmath117 ) .",
    "the total efficiency for photohadronic production depends on the spectrum of accelerated protons and ions .",
    "if an @xmath118 spectrum is assumed , then the efficiency is reduced in proportion to the number of decades of weakly radiating low - energy protons",
    ". this might not be too severe if the lowest energy protons have escaping energy @xmath119 pev .",
    "furthermore , nonlinear shock acceleration in colliding shells , and second - order processes in the shocked fluid can give harder cosmic - ray spectra , though consistency when fitting the measured uhecr spectrum would constrain the assumed accelerated cosmic - ray spectrum .    the final expression in eq .  ( [ eta ] ) , specific to parameters of grb 080916c , shows that @xmath120  10% of the energy can be extracted via photohadronic processes by protons with energy @xmath121 , with more than half of this energy released in the form of leptons and photons which generates an electromagnetic cascade emerging in the form of @xmath38 rays when the system becomes optically thin to @xmath37 processes . at @xmath122 ,",
    "a larger fraction is extracted .",
    "consequently , the energy of baryons must be @xmath35 to 100 @xmath123 greater than the nonthermal lepton content if a comparable amount of electromagnetic radiation is to be emitted from hadronic as leptonic processes .",
    "note the sensitive @xmath56-dependence of the photohadronic efficiency , @xmath124 , by comparison with @xmath125 .",
    "the implications for neutrino and @xmath38-ray production are considered in @xcite .",
    "in this contribution , we have sketched the energy requirements for grbs to be sources of uhecrs , and for electromagnetic signatures of ultrarelativistic hadrons to be found in the _ fermi _ data .",
    "the large amounts of energy needed has been noted many times in the past , whether from proton synchrotron @xcite or photohadronic processes .",
    "although the large energy requirements make uncomfortable demands on @xmath38-ray emission models , an internal consistency is found insofar as the baryon load in long grbs must be large given their relative rarity within the gzk radius , and that enormous energies are available from the rotational and accretion energy in the newly forming black holes .",
    "observations and the possibility of detecting pev neutrinos from grbs with icecube could establish whether grbs are the sources of uhecrs .",
