    "the optical light - curves of most afterglows monitored over more than one decade in time exhibit a steepening at about 1 day after the grb .",
    "such a break has been predicted by the sideways spreading jet model of rhoads ( 1999 ) and was observed shortly afterward for the first time in the afterglow 990123 ( kulkarni 1999 ) . since then , many other afterglows displayed an optical light - curve break , to which the jet model has been extensively applied .",
    "rees & mszros ( 1998 ) have proposed that the blast wave may be `` refreshed '' when there is a substantial energy input in the forward shock .",
    "such an energy injection could occur either if there is a wide distribution of lorentz factors in the grb explosion , the slower ejecta catching up with those which were initially faster during their deceleration by the circumburst medium , or if the central energy is long lived , releasing a relativistic outflow for hours or days after the explosion .",
    "the increase of the ejecta energy mitigates the deceleration of the forward shock , which results in a slower decay of the afterglow flux , as was proposed by fox ( 2003 ) to explain the nearly flat optical light - curve of the afterglow 021004 at 0.0030.1 days after the burst . in this model ,",
    "a steepening of the afterglow decay would occur when the rate of energy injection decreases .",
    "another possibility , proposed by mszros , rees & wijers ( 1998 ) , is that the angular distribution of the ejecta kinetic energy is not uniform .",
    "then , as the fireball decelerates , the relativistic beaming of the radiation allows the observer to receive emission from an ever wider region of the fireball , whose energy varies with observer time differently than in the case of an isotropic energy distribution . in this model",
    ", a light - curve break would result if the second order angular derivative of the energy per solid angle is negative , as in the scenario proposed by rossi , lazzati & rees ( 2002 ) and zhang & mszros ( 2002 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to test the above possible models for afterglow beaks : refreshed shocks , structured outflows , and spreading jets . to this end",
    ", we compare the light - curve breaks expected in each model with those measured in the optical emission of ten grb afterglows , and add consistency checks with the @xmath1-ray light - curves and the optical - to-@xmath1-ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) slope .",
    "the simplest and most widely used test of the blast wave model for grb afterglows consists of comparing the light - curve decay index with the sed slope .",
    "it is a robust prediction of the standard blast wave model ( mszros & rees 1997 ) , confirmed by observations ( wijers , rees & mszros 1997 ) , that the afterglow light - curve at a frequency @xmath4 above the peak of the afterglow spectrum decays as a power - law @xmath5 where @xmath6 depends only on the location of the cooling frequency ( @xmath7 ) relative to @xmath4 , the slope @xmath8 of the power - law distribution @xmath9 with the energy @xmath10 of the electrons accelerated by the blast - wave @xmath11 and the radial stratification of the circumburst medium : @xmath12 with @xmath13 for a homogeneous environment and @xmath14 for the free wind of a massive grb progenitor . for a fireball ( or a jet at times when it is sufficiently relativistic that relativistic beaming prevents its finite angular opening to affect the observed afterglow emission ) , the light - curve index of equation ( [ fnu ] ) is given by @xmath15 ( sari , piran & piran 1998 ) .",
    "the second line in the @xmath16 of equation ( [ alpha ] ) assumes that electron cooling is dominated by synchrotron losses . if radiative losses occur mainly through inverse compton scatterings , then @xmath17 ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "we ignore the possibility of inverse compton dominated electron cooling , keeping in mind that , because of this deficiency of our treatment , we may miss some viable models with @xmath18 .    for the electron distribution given in equation ( [ dnde ] ) ,",
    "the intrinsic afterglow sed at optical and @xmath1-ray frequencies is a power - law : @xmath19 eliminating the electron index @xmath8 between equations ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) , leads to @xmath20 where the order in the @xmath16 is the same as in equation ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ ab ] ) is often used to test the blast wave model and to identify the type of external medium ( if @xmath21 ) . however",
    ", this exercise may not always provide a conclusive result because a small amount of dust extinction in the host galaxy can alter significantly the slope of the optical sed .",
    "for an extinction of @xmath22 magnitudes at an observer frequency @xmath4 , the local slope of the reddened sed is @xmath23 = \\ ] ] @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the intrinsic ( unreddened ) sed slope . for a simple @xmath26 reddening curve , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the extinction in the host frame at the observing frequency @xmath4 .",
    "hence , a host extinction of @xmath29 mag is enough to confuse the test based on equation ( [ ab ] ) for an afterglow at redshift @xmath30 .",
    "there are a few mechanisms ( described below ) which can alter the light - curve decay index @xmath6 of equation ( [ alpha ] ) and , hence , modify the test equation ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "as proposed by rees & mszros ( 1998 ) , the blast wave may be `` refreshed '' by some delayed ( or lagged ) ejecta . for convenience , we quantify the energy injection by expressing the fireball energy @xmath31 as a function of the observer time @xmath32 .",
    "that afterglow light - curves are power - laws in observer time indicates that @xmath33 is not far from a power - law either .",
    "for this reason , we consider that @xmath34 assuming negligible radiative losses after about 0.1 day , when afterglow observations are usually made , the fireball lorentz factor is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the mass of the swept - up circumburst medium",
    ". together with @xmath37 , equation ( [ e ] ) is equivalent with the following distribution of the ejecta energy with lorentz factor : @xmath38 for @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) for a homogeneous ( wind - like ) medium .",
    "the effect of energy injection on the afterglow flux @xmath41 decay can be easily assessed from the expression of @xmath42 as function of the fireball energy @xmath31 for the no - injection case . from equations ( b7 ) , ( b8 ) , and ( c5 ) of panaitescu & kumar ( 2000 ) , the effect of energy injection is a reduction of the light - curve decay index given in equation ( [ alpha ] ) by @xmath43 when the injection of energy subsides , the power - law afterglow decay steepens from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , assuming that the ejecta are spherical or sufficiently relativistic that the effects associated with collimation are not yet manifested .",
    "another possibility is that the ejecta energy per solid angle , @xmath46 , is not constant , but varies with the angle @xmath47 measured from the outflow symmetry axis ( mszros , rees & wijers 1998 ) .",
    "the acceleration of the grb outflow and penetration through what is still left of the progenitor stellar envelope should lead to a @xmath46 decreasing with increasing polar angle @xmath47 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "11 of macfadyen , woosley & heger ( 2001 ) , given that the mass per solid angle of the helium core increases with @xmath47 ( hence a higher binding energy and a larger dissipation of the jet energy , leading to a faster jet spread , at larger angles ) .",
    "that afterglow light - curves are power - laws in time suggests that @xmath46 can be sufficiently well approximated as a power - law in @xmath47 : @xmath48 with a uniform core of opening @xmath49 to avoid the on - axis divergence . to make use of analytical results for the light - curve decay index ( panaitescu & kumar 2003 ) , we assume in this work that the direction toward the observer lies within the core opening . in this case , when the blast - wave has decelerated enough that the emission from the outflow envelope is beamed relativistically toward the observer ( when the fireball lorentz factor @xmath50 drops below @xmath51 ) , the afterglow emission decay steepens from that given in equation ( [ alpha ] ) to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 because the envelope has an energy density smaller than that of the core .",
    "equation ( [ so ] ) holds provided that @xmath54 , with @xmath55 if the observer lies outside the core , the pre - break decay index can not be obtained analytically .",
    "obviously , as the more energetic core becomes visible to the observer , the afterglow decay should be shallower than that given in equation ( [ alpha ] ) and the break magnitude larger than that of equation ( [ so ] ) ( see fig . 2 and 3 in panaitescu & kumar 2003 ) .",
    "for @xmath56 the ejecta energy density @xmath46 falls - off away from the axis sufficiently fast that the afterglow emission is dominated by the core . in this case , when the core boundary becomes visible the afterglow decay index increases by @xmath57 independent of frequency ( panaitescu , mszros & rees 1998 ) .",
    "the subscript `` j / o '' stands for `` jet in an outflow '' and hereafter will identify the model of a jet whose lateral spreading is prevented by the envelope but which gives essentially all the afterglow emission",
    ".      an even larger break @xmath2 than given in equation ( [ jo ] ) is obtained if the envelope has too little ejecta to impede the lateral spreading of the core , as the sideways expansion of the jet leads to a faster decrease of its lorentz factor , starting at about the same time when the jet edge becomes visible .",
    "this model represents the extreme case of a structured outflow with @xmath46 a `` top - hat '' function ( @xmath58 in ) .",
    "when the jet edge becomes visible , the light - curve power - law decay steepens from that in equation ( [ alpha ] ) to @xmath59 ( rhoads 1999 ) , the light - curve index increases by @xmath60",
    "to summarize , in the framework of the above models , afterglows light - curves should exhibit a steepening from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , with : @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath6 is that given in equation ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ beta ] ) for the intrinsic sed slope @xmath25 , equation ( [ betaobs ] ) for the observed slope @xmath67 , and equations ( [ break1])([break2 ] ) , provide a simple criterion to determine from the observables @xmath6 and @xmath67 which case is at work , for a given model and afterglow : @xmath68 where @xmath69 hz . in the above criterion , the pre - break index @xmath70 applies to the so , j / o and j models , and the post - break index @xmath71 is to be used for the ei model .",
    "the first line of equation ( [ ba ] ) states that even the largest possible intrinsic sed slope , @xmath72 , is too small to be consistent with the steepness of the post - break light - curve decay .",
    "the following lines specify which cases are allowed ; in each case the difference @xmath73 giving the host extinction @xmath74 .",
    "once the working cases for the ei model are identified , the break magnitude @xmath2 can be used to determine the exponent @xmath75 of the injection law . from equations ( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ ei ] ) : @xmath76 the only restriction here is @xmath39 for a homogeneous medium and @xmath40 for a wind - like medium , otherwise the dynamics of the refreshed shocks would be inconsistent with the assumed injection law @xmath77 .    taking the break magnitude given in equation ( [ j ] ) as an upper limit for the @xmath2 allowed by the so , j / o and j models , and keeping in mind that larger breaks could result from structured outflows if the observer lies outside the core opening , one reaches the following criterion for identifying the viable cases for structured outflows and jets : @xmath78 for the so model , if the observer is located within the opening of the uniform core , the measured @xmath2 determines the exponent @xmath79 of the angular distribution of the ejecta kinetic energy ( ) . from equations ( [ alpha ] ) ,",
    "( [ so ] ) and ( [ qt ] ) , one obtains @xmath80 if the direction toward the observer is outside the outflow core , then the criterion given in equation ( [ jj ] ) does not hold . from the maximum post - break decay index allowed by the so model @xmath81 and from @xmath82 , the criterion given in equation ( [ ba ] ) is replaced by @xmath83",

    "as shown in table 2 , only a few models are eliminated by the @xmath1-ray constraints .",
    "the first conclusion to be drawn from table 2 is that an energy injection ( the * ei * model ) , mediated by some initially slower ejecta which catch up with the shock - front ( the `` refreshed shock '' model ) , may be at work in many afterglows , although not in all the afterglows with breaks .",
    "for the same electron index @xmath8 , a wind - like medium yields a faster light - curve decay than a homogeneous one , which makes the free wind medium more often compatible with the steepness of the post - break decay .",
    "the break magnitude @xmath2 determines the exponent of the assumed power - law energy injection law ( ) . for a homogeneous medium , we obtain @xmath116 , while for a free wind , @xmath117 , which imply that the total energy output until the break time ( @xmath118 ) is larger than the post - burst energy of the grb ejecta by a factor of at least @xmath119 ( @xmath120 for a free wind ) , where @xmath121 is the epoch of the first optical measurement ( see 2nd column of table 1 ) .",
    "if the afterglow energy after the end of the energy injection process is close to that previously inferred by us from afterglow fits using the jet model ( panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) , then the grb output is about 80 per cent of the ejecta initial energy .",
    "such a high efficiency of the grb mechanism is a serious problem ( kumar 1999 ) for the internal shock model .    the resulting range for the @xmath75 parameter and equation ( [ gamma ] )",
    "imply that the distribution of energy with lorentz factor is @xmath122 with @xmath123 for a homogeneous medium and @xmath124 for a free wind .",
    "the numerical calculations of aloy ( 2000 ) for the jet propagation through a collapsing massive star yield at break - out @xmath125 for @xmath126 . a log - log fit to the @xmath127 plot shown in their fig",
    ". 4 yields @xmath128 for @xmath129 and @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "therefore the distribution of ejecta energy with lorentz factor required by the ei model is compatible with that predicted by aloy ( 2000 ) only if the circumburst medium has a wind - like stratification .",
    "in contrast to the ei model , where the break magnitude @xmath2 is determined by the injection exponent @xmath75 and , hence , can have an arbitrary distribution , a structured outflow ( extending this concept to the extreme case of a jet with sharp edges ) can yield a bimodal distribution of @xmath2 : @xmath132 arises when the outflow envelope outshines the core ( the * so * model ) , or when it is important only dynamically , by impeding the core s",
    "lateral spreading ( the * j / o * model ) , while afterglows with @xmath133 arise from outflows with a sufficiently tenuous envelope that the core can expand sideways ( the * j * model ) .",
    "the current sample of 10 afterglows with light - curve breaks is too small to test the existence of a bimodal @xmath2 distribution . if the tentative gap at @xmath134 shown in fig .",
    "2 is real , it will favour a homogeneous medium around grbs .",
    "the second conclusion is that the so model may be at work in more than half of the analyzed afterglows . in these cases , a @xmath135 angular distribution of the ejecta kinetic energy per solid angle",
    "is required for a homogeneous medium and @xmath136 for a free wind .",
    "the numerical simulation of jets produced in type ii collapsars , shown in fig .",
    "11 of macfadyen ( 2001 ) , shows that , after having propagated through the helium core , the angular distribution of the jet kinetic energy can be approximated as @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "such a steep fall - off of the ejecta kinetic energy away from the outflow axis corresponds to the j / o and j models .",
    "the third conclusion is that a spreading jet interacting with a homogeneous medium is the only viable model for the afterglows 990510 , 000301 , 011211 , and 030226 , as their break magnitudes @xmath2 are too large to be accommodated by a structured outflow ( assuming the observer to be within the opening of the core ) or by a jet interacting with a free wind .",
    "in fact , for the afterglows 000301 and 030226 , the measured @xmath2 is so large , that even the j model is only marginally consistent with the observations .",
    "larger break magnitudes would result from combining the ei and j models , though this would require a coincidence : the simultaneity of the energy injection cessation with the jet edge becoming visible to the observer .",
    "stronger light - curve breaks would also result from structured outflows if the direction toward the observer were outside the core opening ( panaitescu & kumar 2003 ) , a case not included in this work .",
    "such locations could also yield a cusp in the light - curve when the more energetic core becomes visible , at the time of the light - curve break ( granot & kumar 2003 ) .",
    "a more accurate comparison between the features of the above four models for light - curve breaks and the afterglow temporal / spectral properties requires numerical calculations of the outflow dynamics and emission .",
    "such calculations can follow the transition between the asymptotic power - law light - curve decays and may rule out some of the models listed in table 2 , if this transition is too slow compared with the observations .",
    "furthermore , numerical calculations provide the framework for inclusion of inverse compton scatterings , which may affect the time - dependence of the cooling frequency ( and , hence , the light - curve decay index at frequencies above it ) and may contribute to the @xmath1-ray afterglow emission .",
    "these two factors have been left out in the derivation of the results presented in  [ models ] ,  [ criteria ] , and  [ tests ] .",
    "finally , numerical modelling of the multiwavelength afterglow emission can determine other afterglow parameters ( ejecta energy , circumburst density , shock microphysical parameters ) in addition to testing the various possible mechanism for light - curve breaks .",
    "in this work we have described a simpler way to test those mechanisms and have shown how some outflow properties ( energy distribution with lorentz factor or with polar angle ) are constrained by afterglow observations .",

    "<S> the optical pre- and post - break decays of these four afterglows are incompatible with a wind - like medium . </S>",
    "<S> + the current sample of 10 afterglows with breaks suggests that the distribution of the break magnitude @xmath2 ( defined as the increase of the afterglow decay exponent ) is bimodal , with a gap at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> if true , this bimodality favours the structured outflow model , while the gap location indicates a homogeneous circumburst environment .    </S>",
