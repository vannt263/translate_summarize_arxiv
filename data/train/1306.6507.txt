    "models for ultrasound attenuation based on relaxation losses have a long history , see e.  g. @xcite .",
    "waag and his coworkers also contributed with their work on multiple relaxation losses ( @xcite ) .",
    "similar , but much simpler relaxation models are used for attenuation in salt water and air . in salt water ,",
    "the two important relaxation processes are due to boric acid and magnesium sulphate ( @xcite ) and in air they are due to nitrogen and oxygen ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , in medical ultrasound and elastography , attenuation for both compressional and shear waves often follows a power law which at first sight is very different from a relaxation model : @xmath0 where @xmath1 usually is between 0 and 2 and @xmath2 is angular frequency .",
    "the subscript @xmath3 is used to indicate that this is the imaginary part of the wave number , @xmath3 , and to distinguish it from the order of the fractional derivative , @xmath4 , which will be used later .    in such media",
    "the number of relaxation processes may in practice be uncountable and it has not been possible to make models for attenuation that are so grounded in physical processes as for salt water and air . nevertheless , the multiple relaxation model with a few processes can be used to model the power - law attenuation as waag s group and several others have done ( @xcite ) over a limited frequency range .",
    "but , the relaxation parameters lose their clear physical meaning in this case and become just parameters of a mathematical model . thus on the one hand",
    "there is power law attenuation which is experimentally observed in many different complex materials and on the other hand physical models , exemplified by the multiple relaxation model .    in the last decade or so",
    "advances have been made in providing wave equations that partially bridge this gap .",
    "they model power law attenuation through the use of fractional , i.e. non - integer , derivatives . to varying degrees",
    "these equations are physics - based , but especially for some viscoelastic polymers there is a good physical foundation , @xcite",
    ". however , there is seldom as direct a connection as for the relaxation models for air and salt water .",
    "nevertheless , they represent one step on the way to a deeper understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "they also provide alternative simulations models for wave propagation , often characterized by being parametrized with a low number of parameters .    for this paper the time fractional derivative is easiest to define in the frequency domain where it is an extension of the fourier transform of an @xmath5th order derivative : @xmath6    the fractional derivative of arbitrary order can be understood as a generalization where the integer @xmath5 is replaced with a real number @xmath4 .",
    "the close connection between power laws and fractional derivatives is evident from this definition .",
    "the time domain equivalent involves a convolution integral implying that the fractional derivative is non - local and has a power - law shaped memory , @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to analyze and compare several of the fractional wave equations , to understand their origins , and to relate them to each other .",
    "the ultimate objective is to find wave equations which are physically viable .",
    "another more practical objective is to determine which wave equations that are best suited for simulation of medical ultrasound and of shear wave elastography .",
    "one of the questions asked is also : what is the most fundamental property to model with a wave equation ?",
    "is the objective only to model a power law attenuation , or is it more fundamental to model a medium with viscoelastic properties so that different power law attenuation laws are achieved in different frequency regions ?    due to the fact that it is usually the low frequency region which is of interest , many wave equations model only this region .",
    "but there are applications where the high frequency region is important also , one particularly important one is in shear wave elastography .",
    "even when the interest is only in the low frequency solution , such as for ultrasound imaging , then in order for the solution to be physically viable , it is often an advantage that wave equations give correct solutions beyond this region .",
    "the key to obtaining such results is the viscoelastic constitutive equation .",
    "the paper therefore builds a case for the viewpoint that it is the viscoelastic constitutive equation which is the more fundamental and physical property , rather than the power law characteristics .",
    "it should be noted that low frequencies here means low in comparison to the value of a time constant ( @xmath7 in e.g.  eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavecaputo ] ) ) .",
    "thus for e.g. compressional waves in medical ultrasound , low frequencies stretch well beyond the usual range and up into the 100 s of mhz or higher .",
    "for such an application the power law has an exponent , @xmath1 , between one and two . on the other hand ,",
    "it turns out that for shear waves in the human body in elastography , the low frequency limit is at less than 10 hz ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus elastography operates above the low frequency limit with @xmath1 less than unity .",
    "there are some criteria that need to be satisfied by the solutions of wave equations in order for them to be physically viable .",
    "the first is that of causality : no output is allowed before there is an input .",
    "the second property is that the loss function can not rise arbitrarily fast and has to satisfy : @xmath8    this means that the exponent , @xmath1 , has to be less or equal to one in the high frequency limit .",
    "this condition was first given by @xcite and more rigorously by @xcite .",
    "it follows from causality , passivity , and linearity and is a consequence of the property that viscoelasticity can be modelled as a sum of many spring - dashpot mechanical models with realistic , i.e. positive , constants , @xcite .",
    "we will give wave equations for plane waves in a homogenous medium . fig .",
    "[ fig : slab ] illustrates how the wave is modified by transmission through a slab of thickness @xmath9 .",
    "the wave number is in general complex and given by @xmath10 where the real part describes dispersion and the imaginary part gives the attenuation .",
    "note that many papers use the opposite sign for the exponent in the travelling wave .",
    "this will result in somewhat different wave equations .",
    "this is shown in the appendix a which has been included in order to facilitate comparisons between papers using different sign conventions .     with a plane wave travelling from left to right.,width=377 ]",
    "one of the oldest fractional wave equations is due to @xcite . in the terminology of @xcite",
    "it is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the displacement , @xmath13 is the phase velocity at zero frequency , @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : powerlaw ] ) , and the condition @xmath15 has to be satisfied . here",
    "we will call it _ the fractional kelvin - voigt wave equation_. this equation and all subsequent wave equations in this paper could equally well have been formulated for the particle velocity , @xmath16 , and in the case of compressional waves also the pressure , @xmath17 .    for low frequencies relative to the relaxation time constant @xmath7 , @xmath18 @xmath4 and the power law exponent of eq .",
    "( [ eq : powerlaw ] ) are related by @xmath19 where @xmath20 .    _",
    "the fractional zener wave equation _ derived by @xcite is an extension of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavecaputo ] ) with an additional loss term which contributes to a different behavior for very high frequencies : @xmath21    these equations are here said to have a fractional time loss operator of type 1 , because there is a term with a mix of a fractional time derivative and a non - fractional laplacian in the loss term .",
    "type 2 of the fractional time loss operator is an operator which has only temporal derivatives .",
    "the distinction between types 1 and 2 is only to aid in the presentation of the various loss operators .",
    "the first type 2 operator is the general szabo convolution model : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the temporal convolution operator .",
    "the causal loss operator , @xmath24 is given by the power law attenuation that it describes and has different forms for even and odd integer values of @xmath1 and for the non - integer case , see @xcite for details .",
    "this wave equation can be written in terms of fractional derivatives ( @xcite ) and in the terminology of @xcite _ the fractional szabo equation _ is : @xmath25 @xcite added an extra loss term to eq .",
    "( [ eq : szabofractional ] ) in order to model power law losses with exactly the same exponent , @xmath1 , for all frequencies",
    ". therefore we will call it _ the power law wave equation _ : @xmath26      @xcite proposed _ the fractional laplacian wave equation _ : @xmath27 it was amended by the addition of an extra loss term by @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the additional loss term makes the wave equation causal at low frequencies , so a proper name is _ the causal fractional laplacian wave equation_. note however that the sign of this last term will depend on the definition of the fourier transform used in the derivation , as explained in appendix a.      the most general way to express the loss term in the wave equations is by means of a convolution operator .",
    "it can model losses which are different from power laws also .",
    "the convolution terminology is taken from sec .",
    "( 4.2.2 ) in @xcite and in the creep representation it is : @xmath31 where @xmath32/j_g$ ] is the rate of creep , @xmath33 is the creep compliance , and @xmath34 is the glass compliance .",
    "the various fractional operators discussed in this paper are such that they result in power law attenuation . thus by comparison with the fractional szabo equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : szabofractional ] ) , the convolution with the rate of creep corresponds to the operator : @xmath35 the alternative relaxation representation of eq .",
    "is , @xcite : @xmath36    where @xmath37/g_g$ ] is the rate of relaxation , @xmath38 is the relaxation modulus , and @xmath39 is the glass modulus . hence the fractional kelvin - voigt wave equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavecaputo ] ) , can be formulated by using : @xmath40    towards the end of the paper , we will also formulate the nachman - smith - waag model in the convolution framework .",
    "the most general constitutive equation considered here is the fractional zener model , or the fractional standard linear solid . following @xcite it is : @xmath41 ,   \\label{eq : gzener}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is stress , @xmath43 is strain , and the elastic modulus is the equilibrium modulus . in the general case , stress and strain",
    "are tensors , but here it is sufficient to represent them as scalars in order to demonstrate the properties of the resulting wave equations .",
    "this model is also a special case of a more general convolution model between stress and strain expressed by the creep compliance , @xmath33 , or the relaxation modulus , @xmath38 .",
    "this constitutive equation is well founded in material science as a good description of material properties as reviewed in ch .  3 of @xcite and the survey paper @xcite .",
    "there the conditions @xmath44 and @xmath45 are justified also .",
    "it is also common to assume the even stricter condition that @xmath46 which will be done in the rest of this paper also .",
    "this condition is necessary in order to make the system thermodynamically well - behaved . as an example , the model has been used to model shear wave propagation in human tissue in elastography , @xcite .    although the constitutive equation gives a good description of materials , our understanding of why this is so is still lacking , i.e. what is it in the underlying microstructure of the materials that gives this behavior ?",
    "therefore the fractional parameter @xmath4 can not be determined directly from a physical model , but it is closely related to the power law behavior of the attenuation see belowl .",
    "one of the advantages of the model over the multiple relaxation model ( @xcite ) is parsimony , i.  e.  that it is described by only four parameters ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is fewer than the number of parameters required for the multiple relaxation model except for the very simplest of media such as air and salt water .",
    "this is usually an advantage in simulations .    when eq .",
    "( [ eq : gzener ] ) is combined with conservation of mass and momentum , it leads to the fractional zener wave equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zenerwave ] ) , for which the dispersion relation is : @xmath50 the simpler , three - term kelvin - voigt constitutive equation is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gzener ] ) by setting @xmath51 .",
    "examples of fitting of that model to shear wave elastography data can be found in @xcite .",
    "the fractional kelvin - voigt constitutive equation leads to the wave equation first derived by caputo , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavecaputo ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that there are several ways that this result can be extended for the special case of pressure waves in fluids and liquids .",
    "first , the model may include nonlinear acoustics as done in @xcite .",
    "second , in a complete acoustic theory for fluids and liquids a thermal loss term may also be significant .",
    "this was analyzed in the former two references as well as summarized in @xcite .",
    "this paper will build on the asymptotic results previously determined for the low , intermediate and high frequency regions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zenerwave ] ) . for completeness",
    "the main results from @xcite are repeated here .",
    "the attenuation follows these asymptotes : @xmath52 the phase velocity also has three regimes : @xmath53    in the case of the fractional kelvin - voigt model with @xmath51 , the third regime will disappear for both the attenuation and the phase velocity . in that case",
    "one can recognize the well - known result for the viscous loss model with a non - fractional derivative , @xmath54 , ( stokes equation ) which gives attenuation proportional to @xmath55 for low frequencies and proportional to @xmath56 for high frequencies .",
    "the following sections builds on a set of approximations derived for the low - frequency regime which are given in appendix b. they will be used subsequently to find various interesting approximations to the lossy wave equation .",
    "an approximation which is valid for low frequencies is obtained by replacing @xmath57 by @xmath58 , eq .",

    "( [ eq : wavecaputo ] ) and ( [ eq : zenerwave ] ) . because it can be derived directly from the causal kelvin - voigt wave equation , it is causal for low frequencies as demonstrated in e.g. @xcite also .",
    "here it has been derived as a low frequency approximation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavecaputo ] ) and this is fully consistent with the low frequency approximation which is a central step in szabo s own derivation .",
    "if one for a moment neglects that it is based on a low frequency assumption , then it is straightforward to show that for high frequencies , the attenuation will be proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "but at these frequencies , the equation is used for something which violates its assumptions .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that this also conflicts with the condition for a physically viable solution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymptoticcondition ] ) .      in the derivation above , the starting point was the kelvin - voigt wave equation or its generalization the zener wave equation",

    "( [ eq : lowfreqcond ] ) so that the time - space substitution @xmath63 could be used .",
    "an alternative is to say that the power law attenuation and the accompanying dispersion required from causality is the goal .",
    "the objective is then to find a wave equation which satisfies power law attenuation exactly .",
    "this is the starting point of @xcite and it is the same as requiring that the low frequency approximation for the wave number in eq .",

    "it is repeated here : @xmath65",
    "@xcite say that the last term usually can be neglected since it is proportional to @xmath66 and thus is small compared to the main loss term .",
    "therefore it does nt make much difference .",
    "this is certainly the case for low frequencies according to the condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowfreqcond ] ) , where @xmath67 is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "but for high frequencies , the enforced power law relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowfreq3 ] ) still holds exactly , and does so for however high frequencies one tries for . as the frequency increases above the low frequency condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowfreqcond ] ) , the last loss term will play a larger and larger role .",
    "this wave equation therefore models the same power law attenuation for all frequencies .",
    "most other wave equations only model this attenuation for low frequencies .",
    "but , as long as the exponent , @xmath1 , is larger than 1 , the condition for a physically viable solution according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : asymptoticcondition ] ) is violated .",
    "this is the limitation of the wave equation of @xcite : at low frequencies the extra loss term can be neglected , and at high frequencies it may make the solution physically unviable .",
    "this problem was also illustrated by @xcite through numerical simulations .",
    "the paper by @xcite takes the same approach as @xcite and tries to model a power law attenuation exactly . as a result their eq .",
    "( 36 ) is similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : kellydispersion ] ) .",
    "however , @xcite go further as they have observed that the result is non - causal when @xmath68 .",
    "they then amend their wave equation in order to make it causal .",
    "the result , eq .  ( 61 ) in @xcite is a wave equation which after some reorganization can be written on this form : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the asymptote of the phase velocity at infinite frequency .",
    "the first four terms are similar to those of the fractional zener wave equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : zenerwave ] ) .",
    "the final fourier transform term can be approximated for different frequency regions and it can be shown that it will merge into the second and fourth terms . in our view @xcite give an argument , albeit a rather indirect and involved one , for why the fractional zener wave equation has the desirable property of physical validity for all frequencies .",
    "expansion of the square @xmath71 in eq.(61 ) of @xcite gives the following lossy wave equation : @xmath72    note that we use the fourier kernel @xmath73 , as well as @xmath17 instead of @xmath74 .",
    "note that the first four terms are the same terms in the fractional zener wave equation , eg .",
    "( [ eg : zenerwave ] ) .    for low frequencies the last term can be approximated to : @xmath75    ? ? ?",
    "they defined @xmath76 as the phase velocity at zero frequency , @xmath77 . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : kowarwaveeq ] ) the zero frequency phase velocity is given by @xmath78 ... ? ? ?",
    "thus it is seen that in the low frequency case , the three last terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kowarwaveeq ] ) , will be of the same form as the second and fourth terms . therefore @xcite have derived a wave equation which is very similar to the fractional zener wave equation .",
    "the difference is that rather than finding it from physical consitutive equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gzener ] ) , they have found it from the combination of a power law with a strong causality condition .",
    "in this section we go back to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersionlow ] ) and use substitutions based on @xmath63 in the loss terms as in the previous section .",
    "the difference is that we only partially substitute time for space . by assuming low frequencies and replacing @xmath79 by @xmath80 in the first loss term and by using @xmath81 instead of @xmath79 in the second loss term one",
    "gets : @xmath82 the equivalent wave equation using the fractional laplacian introduced by @xcite is : @xmath83    first let s neglect the last term . as @xmath84 using eq .",

    ", this equation does not satisfy the kramers - kronig condition as has been pointed out by several researchers . the fractional laplacian wave equation of eq .",
