    "nuclear masses are fundamental properties of atomic nuclei , the knowledge of which is indispensable for nuclear structure and astrophysics research  @xcite .",
    "therefore , precise mass measurements are highly important and are pursued by many groups worldwide  @xcite .",
    "presently , nuclides with unknown masses lie far - off stability and their mass measurements become a technical challenge due to the tiny production rates and short half - lives .",
    "the isochronous mass spectrometry ( ims ) , applied to relativistic nuclear reaction products , is an ideal technique for mass measurements of such short - lived rare nuclides  @xcite .",
    "the ims measurements were pioneered at the esr facility of gsi  @xcite and have recently been established at the storage ring csre of imp  @xcite ,    on the one hand , the ims has an ultimate sensitivity to single ions stored in a storage ring . on the other hand",
    ", the ims does not require any lengthy preparation of the particles , like , e.g. , cooling , and can be applied on systems with lifetimes as short as a few tens of microseconds  @xcite .",
    "we note , that the secondary ions of interest have an inevitable velocity spread , @xmath8 , due to the production reaction process .",
    "the revolution period , @xmath9 , of an ion circulating in a storage ring depends on its mass - to - charge ratio , @xmath10 , and on its velocity , @xmath11 . in a certain magnetic rigidity acceptance ,",
    "the ions with different @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be stored , where , for the same type of ions , the faster ions circulate on longer orbits while the slower ones on the shorter orbits . just in a special",
    ", isochronous ion - optical setting of the ring , the differences of the orbit lengths compensate the differences of velocities , although within a limited range of magnetic rigidities , @xmath12 .",
    "then , the revolution periods of stored ions depend only on their @xmath10 ratios and are independent of their velocities . thus , the masses of stored ions can be measured through accurate determination of their revolution period @xmath9 .    obviously , the precision of the revolution period determinations is crucial . for a certain ion species with the same mass - to - charge ratio ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "the resolving power @xmath14 is given in first - order approximation by the frequency dispersion ( @xmath15 ) and the relative spread of magnetic rigidities , @xmath16 , according to the following equation  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relativistic lorentz factor and @xmath19 is the transition energy of a storage ring , which connects the relative change of the orbit length to the relative change of magnetic rigidity of the circulating ions . in a recent experiment in the csre , in order to achieve the resolving power @xmath20 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 were restricted to be within @xmath21 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) one sees , that @xmath22 depends on the absolute value of @xmath9 ( or , in other words , on the @xmath10 value ) and varies with the ion s velocities . in the csre experiments , @xmath23 typically reaches its minimum at @xmath24 ps , which is called good isochronous region corresponding to @xmath25  @xcite . individual measurements of the revolution periods of the stored ions are extremely fast and are @xmath26  ms and @xmath27s in the gsi and imp measurements , respectively , which allows for addressing nuclides with half - lives at least as short as the required measurement time .    in discussions above",
    ", the magnetic fields of the storage ring magnets are assumed perfectly constant .",
    "however , in reality , the fields of the csre magnets experience slow fluctuations of the order of @xmath28 . as a consequence ,",
    "the revolution periods of the ions stored in the ring inevitably change too , leading to an extra time spread of more than @xmath29  ps .",
    "this huge time spread significantly deteriorates the achievable resolving power .",
    "although the magnetic fields can be stabilised down to @xmath30 , as , e.g. , in riken  @xcite , by using dedicated power supply systems , the instabilities of the fields are in principle unavoidable . therefore , much effort was devoted to find a proper data analysis method to eliminate the influence of the magnetic field instabilities  @xcite .",
    "revolution periods change due to magnetic field variations by approximately the same value for all ions , that is , the change in the magnetic field causes a drift of the overall spectrum , which can be corrected for . since the pioneering experiments at gsi  @xcite , the methods for correcting the magnetic drift are being developed all the time . in the first ims experiments , the data acquired during a short period of time ( typically several minutes ) were grouped together in a sub - spectrum .",
    "the accumulated statistics allowed for a least squares type analysis of the drifts between individual sub - spectra , which allowed for merging them together into a final spectrum .",
    "afterwards , the mean revolution times and standard deviations of the peaks in the total spectrum are used to obtain the mass values and their uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of such method is that the magnetic field instabilities within the accumulation time are not taken into account .",
    "another method is the correlation - matrix approach , which was developed at first for the schottky mass measurements at gsi  @xcite and extended later also to the ims  @xcite .",
    "it was applied only once on uranium fission data , where , due to the tiny secondary particle yields , the combination of several spectra together was still needed .    to overcome the disadvantage of grouping the data , the data on the mass measurements of @xmath31kr fragments performed at csre  @xcite were analysed in another way : the drifts due to magnetic field instabilities",
    "were corrected between individual measurements , where the instabilities within the measurement time ( @xmath27s ) can safely be neglected .",
    "seven ions , which have the highest counting statistics , were chosen as references .",
    "the revolution periods for the reference ions were set to the same value in all measurements where these ions were present , which combined together form a sub - spectrum for this reference ion .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is clearly the increase of the revolution period spreads due to the artificial setting of the spread for the reference ion to zero .",
    "furthermore , the measurements not containing reference ions were not considered in the analysis .",
    "nevertheless , a much higher resolving power could be achieved with this method as compared to an uncorrected spectrum . however",
    ", this method may not be suitable for experiments in which no suitable reference ions are expected , e.g. , for mass measurements of very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "in this work , a new method , taking into account the drifts between individual measurements , is proposed to accurately deduce the revolution periods of the stored ions and their standard deviations .",
    "a typical ims experiment lasts for several days or weeks .",
    "the revolution periods of several tens of ions can be determined in several ten thousands of measurements .",
    "each individual measurement contains around ten simultaneously stored ions and takes merely 200 @xmath32s . within such short period of time",
    ", the magnetic fields can be regarded as being constant .",
    "this is an important starting point in our analysis and discussions .",
    "the experimental details , ion identification , and extraction of the revolution periods from acquired timing information on the circulating ions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us define the revolution periods of the @xmath33-th ion species ( @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being the total number of different ion species ) in the @xmath36-th measurement ( @xmath37 , with @xmath38 being the total number of measurements ) as @xmath39 .",
    "the magnetic fields of the storage ring vary slowly in time around a central mean value @xmath40 .",
    "the variation of the magnetic field in the @xmath36-th measurement with respect to @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath39 data in this measurement can be written as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the revolution periods in the absence of magnetic field variations and @xmath44 is the drift due to @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 follow the normal distribution , @xmath47 with expectation mean values @xmath48 and their standard deviations @xmath49 . here ,",
    "the @xmath49 include all the other uncertainty factors of the measurements except for the instabilities of magnetic fields .",
    "in real measurements , due to the isochronicity conditions , the @xmath49 depend on @xmath48 .",
    "the goal of the following analysis procedure is to determine the @xmath48 and @xmath49 for all ion species @xmath50 , which can then be used for the mass determination .",
    "details of the mathematical derivations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here it is worth noting , that @xmath51 and @xmath44 are independent variables and they vary randomly in the long - time measurements around @xmath48 and 0 , respectively . in an ideal case",
    "when @xmath52 ( @xmath37 ) , all @xmath53 and the measured mean revolution periods @xmath54 should approach @xmath48 with experimental standard deviations @xmath55 approaching @xmath49 . for several ten thousands of measurements the fluctuations of the magnetic fields around @xmath40 average out and one can write : @xmath56 however , the standard deviations include the contribution due to magnetic field fluctuations , @xmath57 : @xmath58 let us assume that all the @xmath35 ions are present in each measurement @xmath36 .",
    "if the @xmath48 and @xmath49 are known , then we can re - construct a new variable @xmath59 , which can be calculated directly from experimental data , through a linear transformation of the variable @xmath39 , i.e. ,    @xmath60    in case of the @xmath61 , the standard deviations of @xmath62 distributions should approach @xmath63 .",
    "however , since the number of ion species , @xmath35 , is finite , the standard deviations @xmath64 of the resulting distributions @xmath62 are smaller than @xmath49 . in other words , the distributions @xmath62",
    "are `` overcorrected '' . for more details",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and given the fact that @xmath44 is a constant for all the ion species in the @xmath65th measurement , it can be shown that @xmath59 are related to @xmath51 as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the term accounting for the `` overcorrection '' of the @xmath62 distributions .",
    "the variance of the @xmath67 values is given by : @xmath68 which approaches 0 when @xmath61 .",
    "under the condition that @xmath69 and @xmath67 are independent variables one can write : @xmath70 and @xmath71    as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , @xmath72 , which may cause extra systematic errors : in an ideal case when all @xmath73 and assuming all @xmath74 , all @xmath75 but @xmath76 .",
    "this means that the uncertainties are overestimated by @xmath77 .    for realistic magnitudes of @xmath45 in the csre experiments , @xmath78 , and the new method results in a significant improvement of the resolving power .",
    "to find the unknown @xmath48 and @xmath49 in a real data analysis , the eqs .",
    "( [ eq5])-([eq9 ] ) are solved iteratively .",
    "the important starting step is to provide externally an initial reference set of @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for this purpose ,",
    "simulated values of the revolution periods  @xcite or the ones obtained from the raw experimental data ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq3a ] ) and ( [ eq3b ] ) ) can be used .",
    "the second step is to calculate the @xmath59 values for all ions present in all individual measurements .",
    "this can be done with eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) by substituting @xmath48 and @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) with @xmath79 and @xmath80 . from the set of @xmath59 values ,",
    "one can calculate the mean revolution periods , @xmath81 , and the corresponding standard deviations , @xmath82 @xcite : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the number of occurrences of the @xmath33-th ion species in all @xmath38 measurements .",
    "we note , that the calculated @xmath85 values with eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) are different from those calculated with eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] )",
    ". they would be the same if the initial parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 are exactly equal to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "therefore , in the next step , the results of eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) are used as the new @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this procedure is performed until the convergence is reached .",
    "thus the last @xmath86 and @xmath90 values correspond to the best approximation , as allowed by the statistics in a particular experiment , of the expected @xmath91 and @xmath92 which can be used for the mass determination .",
    "in reality the statistics is finite and the number of species in each measurement is not equal to @xmath35 . for example , three different ions of species @xmath93 are present in the first measurement while the species @xmath94 are stored in a subsequent measurement .",
    "furthermore all different ions appear randomly in different measurements , and finally they have different statistics dependent , e.g. , on the production cross - section , transmission efficiency , etc .",
    "therefore , @xmath95 can significantly be different for measurements with significantly different number of present ion species @xmath96 .",
    "the number of individual measurements @xmath38 is several ten thousands while the average number of simultaneously stored ion species @xmath96 is about 10 .",
    "one can show mathematically ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that in the limit of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 provide the same result , where @xmath100 is a value for the @xmath33-th ion species obtained by averaging of @xmath101 over all measurements where the @xmath33-th ion species is present ( @xmath102 ) : @xmath103 thus the @xmath104 were used in the iteration procedure above .",
    "the data analysis method was applied to the ims experimental data obtained at the csre and results of which were published in ref .  @xcite . by using the new method , the re - determined mass values are consistent with the previously published results , and for some nuclei at isochronous region the mass precision is higher than previous one .",
    "furthermore , since the initial @xmath79 and @xmath80 sets can be provided from an external simulated spectrum , the new method can be an excellent on - line tool to provide a quick response on the experimental conditions such as , e.g. , whether the @xmath105 setting of the ring is tuned correctly to achieve the `` good '' isochronous conditions for the nuclides of interest . to illustrate the feasibility and reliability of the method ,",
    "we present the newly - obtained results from the experiment aiming at mass measurements of @xmath106ni projectile fragments .",
    "the experimental details are reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this experiment ,",
    "a total number @xmath107 of measurements including 195 869 ions of @xmath108 ion species were acquired .",
    "magnetic fields were constantly monitored through hall - probe measurements . in the original data analysis  @xcite ,",
    "the regions of the nearly constant magnetic fields were identified and the corresponding measurements were combined together in sub - spectra .",
    "the sub - spectra were then merged together by finding the best possible overlap between them forming the final revolution time spectrum .",
    "the particle identification was realized by comparing this final spectrum with a simulated one .    in our analysis",
    ", we considered all unambiguously identified ions .",
    "for the initial @xmath79 and @xmath80 sets we employed the simulated @xmath109 and @xmath110 for each ion species .",
    "it is clear that in the first few iterations the @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xmath113 values deviate significantly from the initial ones .",
    "the convergence is reached within a few tens of iterations .",
    "values for several example ions versus the iteration number .",
    "[ fig01],width=8 ]    figure  [ fig01 ] presents the convergence of @xmath111 on the example of several ionic species with different mean @xmath109 .",
    "the latter were chosen to illustrate the convergence in the `` good '' isochronous region as well as far away from it .",
    "we observe nearly exponential convergence of the @xmath111 values versus the iteration number .     for several",
    "example nuclides versus the iteration number .",
    "the initial values of the standard deviations were set equal for all ions .",
    "[ fig02],width=8 ]    figure  [ fig02 ] shows the convergence of the @xmath112 values .",
    "in contrast to @xmath111 values , the convergence of @xmath112 values is rather slow .",
    "typically , a few tens of iterations are sufficient to achieve the variation between subsequent iterations of less than @xmath114  ps for both @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xmath115 .",
    "the final values are considered to be the `` true '' @xmath91 and @xmath116 .",
    "ns is considered .",
    "nucleus with masses unknown according to the ame11 evaluation  @xcite are labelled with the corresponding identification .",
    "[ fig03],width=8 ]    figure  [ fig03 ] provides a comparison of the obtained `` true '' @xmath116 values to those taken from refs .",
    "@xcite for the same ion species .",
    "as expected , in the `` good '' isochronous region , the new @xmath116 values are smaller than those from refs .  @xcite .",
    "this result is easy to understand since the additional uncertainty @xmath117 is to a large extend ( or even completely ) removed in our new data analysis .",
    "obviously this leads to a higher precision mass determination in this region .",
    "the original aim in the experiment was to set the `` good '' isochronous region on the @xmath3mn ions .",
    "however , figure  [ fig03 ] shows that the best isochronous condition ( @xmath118 ) are fulfilled for @xmath1ti ions , and that the @xmath119 for @xmath3mn ions is about twice of that for @xmath1ti ions .",
    "this mismatch translates into a significant increase of statistics , and accordingly the beam time duration , which has to be accumulated for @xmath3mn ions to achieve the aimed mass uncertainties .",
    "this proves that the present method can be valuable as the on - line monitoring tool for checking the correctness of the isochronous setting of the ring . by going to more exotic nuclides with lower production yields ,",
    "the on - line control of the ring settings will become more and more important .",
    "we emphasise that the method can be applied to any ims data irrespective of the storage ring facility where the data are acquired .",
    "finally , we used the new @xmath111 and @xmath112 values deduced from the present analysis to re - determine the masses of interest .",
    "we used the same reference ions for the calibration as well as the fitting procedure as in refs .",
    "the re - determined mass excess values and their uncertainties are given in table .",
    "[ table01 ] . a comparison of the re - determined values with the ones from refs .",
    "@xcite is illustrated in figure  [ fig04 ] .",
    "all data points agree within @xmath120 confidence level .",
    "however , a significant improvement of the precision for the masses of @xmath1ti and @xmath2v is achieved .",
    "the mass resolving power of @xmath1ti is calculated to be @xmath121 ( sigma ) which is increased by a factor of @xmath122 compared to the previously published one .",
    "the latter is mainly due to very scarce counting statistics for this nuclide .",
    "[ fig04],width=8 ]    .the mass values for @xmath123 nuclides obtained in this work . the columns list from left to right : the nuclide , the number of identified ions @xmath124 , @xmath125 values from refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath125 values obtained in this work , and the difference of these mass excess results @xmath126 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table01 ]",
    "the magnetic field instabilities cause a serious deterioration of the mass resolving power in isochronous mass measurements in storage rings , which in turn reduces the achievable precision of the measured mass values .",
    "the instabilities are slow and seen as an extra broadening of the revolution period peaks in the measured spectra .",
    "however , the magnetic fields of the ring can be regarded as being constant during a short time required to perform individual measurements of revolution periods of stored ions .",
    "this time is merely @xmath127s .",
    "the measurements are associated with individual injections of new ions into the ring which are done every few seconds .",
    "the instabilities of magnetic fields cause a shift of the entire revolution period spectrum between such individual measurements . with a new method ,",
    "the overall data obtained in the experiment are used to determine these shifts and thus cancel the influence of the magnetic field instabilities .",
    "the mean values and the standard deviations , including the contribution due to unstable magnetic fields , of the measured revolution periods are connected via a set of equations . in our method",
    "this set of equations is solved iteratively providing the mean revolution periods and the standard deviations without the latter contribution .",
    "these values are then used for the mass determination in a standard way .",
    "the new method has been applied to previously published data from an experiment performed at the csre .",
    "the results for six @xmath123 nuclides are in excellent agreement to the previously published data .",
    "however , the mass precision was significantly improved for the ions of interest lying close to the `` good '' isochronous region at @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the method enables a quick and reliable verification of the isochronous ion - optical setting of the ring .",
    "the present method is based on three assumptions : ( 1 ) the revolution periods for each stored ion should , at least approximately , be normally distributed ; ( 2 ) at least , two ions should be stored simultaneously in each individual measurement ; and ( 3 ) more than three different ion species should randomly occur in various measurements .",
    "these requirements are usually satisfied in all ims experiments at different storage rings , therefore this method is suitable in principle for most of isochronous mass measurements , or even for similar data analyses in other types of experiments .",
