    "due to unique properties , graphene - layer ( gl ) and multiple - graphene - layer ( mgl ) structures  @xcite with p - n and p - i - n junctions are considered as novel building blocks for a variety of electron , terahertz , and optoelectronic devices .",
    "such junctions have been realized using both chemical doping  @xcite and `` electrical '' doping in the gated structures  @xcite .",
    "the formation of p - n and p - i - n junctions with the electrically induced p- and n - regions is possible even in mgl structures with rather large number of gls  @xcite .",
    "different devices based on p - i - n junctions in gl and mgl structures have been proposed recently . in particular ,",
    "the gl and mgl structures with reversed biased p - i - n junctions can be used in infrared ( ir ) and terahertz ( thz ) detectors  @xcite and the tunneling transit - time thz oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the gl and mgl p - i - n junctions under the forward bias can be the basis of ir and thz lasers exploiting the interband population inversion  @xcite ( see also recent experimental results ,  @xcite ) , in which the injection of electrons and holes from the n- and p - regions is utilized  @xcite instead of optical pumping .",
    "a simplified model of the gl and mgl injection lasers with the p - i - n junctions was considered recently  @xcite .",
    "the model in question assumes that the recombination of electrons and holes in the i - region and the leakage thermionic and tunneling currents at the p - i and i - n interfaces are relatively small .",
    "this situation can occur in the structures with sufficiently short i - regions or at relatively low temperatures when the recombination associated with the emission of optical phonons and thermionic leakage are weakened .",
    "in such a case , different components of the current can be considered as perturbations , and the spatial distributions of the electric potential and the carrier density along the i - region are virtually uniform . however , in the p - i - n structures with relatively long i - regions and at the elevated voltages the spatial distribution of the potential can be rather nonuniform , particularly , near the edges of the i - region , i.e. near the p - i and i - n interfaces . in this case ,",
    "the electric field in the i - region can be sufficiently strong .",
    "such an effect can markedly influence the density of the injected carriers , the conditions of the population inversion and current - voltage characteristics .",
    "in this paper , we develop a model for the gl and mgl forward biased p - i - n structures which accounts for relatively strong recombination and consider its effect on the characteristics which can be important for realization of ir / thz injection lasers .",
    "the problem of the electron and hole injection ( double injection ) in gl and mgl p - i - n structures is complicated by the two - dimensional geometry of the device and the features of the carrier transport properties .",
    "this makes necessary to use two - dimensional poisson equation for the self - consistent electric potential around the i - region and to invoke the hydrodynamic equations for carrier transport in gl and mgls .",
    "thus , the present model is a substantial generalization of the model applied in the previous paper  @xcite . to highlight the effects of strong recombination and the nonuniformity of the potential distributions , we , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , disregard for simplicity the effects of the carrier heating or cooling and the effects associated with the nonequilibrium optical phonons .",
    "this can be justified by the fact that the injection of electrons and holes from the pertinent contacts does not bring a large energy to the electron - hole system in the i - region unless the applied bias voltage is large .",

    "ii , we present the gl and mgl p - i - n structures under consideration and the device mathematical model . section iii deals with an analytical solutions of the equations of the model for a special case . here",

    "we assume that the p- and n - regions ( called in the following p- and n - contacts ) in single- or multiple - gl structures are strongly doped , so that the fermi energy in each gl in these structures @xmath0 and hence , the built - in voltage @xmath1 are sufficiently large : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the temperature and @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant . in the single - gl structures with the",

    "but at the forward bias these density become rather large due to the injection .",
    "the injection is limited by the hole charge near the p - i junction and by the electron charge near the i - n junction . due to this , the fermi energy of the injected electrons and holes , @xmath14 , at the pertinent barriers is generally smaller than @xmath0 . however , at the bias voltages comparable with the build - in voltage @xmath1 , these fermi energy can be close to each other .",

    "however , relatively strong interaction of electrons and holes with optical phonons having fairly large energy prevents substantial heating  @xcite in the situations considered in the previous sections . moreover , in the essentially bipolar system the recombination processes with the emission of large energy optical phonons provide a marked cooling of the system , so that its effective temperature can become even lower than the lattice temperature  @xcite .",
    "the above consideration was focused on the double injection in gl and mg p - in structures at the room temperatures .",
    "the obtained results are also applicable at somewhat lower temperatures if the recombination is primarily associated with optical phonons . however , at lower temperatures , other recombination mechanisms can become more crucial , for instance , the auger recombination mediated by scattering mechanisms on impurities and acoustic phonons and due to trigonal warping of the gl band structure , which provide additional momentum and enables transitions to a broader range of final states  @xcite , i.e. , the indirect auger recombination  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) , acoustic phonon recombination , invoking the momentum transfer due to disorder  @xcite , radiative recombination  @xcite , tunneling recombination in the electron - hole puddles  @xcite and edge tunneling recombination ( see ref .  @xcite and sec .",
    "relatively weak role of the optical phonon assisted processes at low temperatures can result in pronounced hot carrier effects  ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "however , these effects are beyond the scope of our paper and require special consideration .",
    "we studied theoretically the double electron - hole injection in gl and mgl p - i - n structures at the forward bias voltages using the developed device model .",
    "the mathematical part of the model was based on a system of hydrodynamic equations governing the electron and hole transport in gls coupled with the two - dimensional poisson equation .",
    "the model is characterized primarily by the following two parameters : the electrostatic parameter @xmath79 and the diffusion parameter @xmath80 .",
    "large value of parameter @xmath79 in practical structures results in the formation of very narrow edge regions near p - i and i - n interfaces , in which all physical quantities vary sharply , and the formation of a wide region , which is stretched across the main portion of the i - region , where all spatial dependences are rather smooth . using analytical and numerical solutions of the equations of the model , we calculated the band edge profiles , the spatial distributions of the quasi - fermi energies , carrier density and velocity , and the current - voltage characteristics .",
    "it was demonstrated that the electron - hole collisions and the collisions of electrons and holes with impurities and acoustic phonons can strongly affect the characteristics of the p - i - n structures . in particular",
    ", such collisions result in a pronounced lowering of the injection efficiency ( weaker dependences of the electron and hole fermi energies and their densities on the bias voltage ) and the modification of the current - voltage characteristics from an exponential to superlinear characteristics ( at collision - dominated transport ) .",
    "it is also shown that for the case of relatively perfect gl and mgl structures , the developed analytical model provides sufficient accuracy in the calculations of spatial distributions in the main portion of the i - region and of the p - i - n structure overall characteristics .",
    "the effects associated with the edge recombination and smearing of the p - i and i - n junctions are evaluated .",
    "the obtained results appear to be useful for the realization and optimization of gl- and mgl -based injection terahertz and infrared lasers .",
