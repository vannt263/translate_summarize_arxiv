    "the transmitted photon number for the postselected subensemble can be written as @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the optical depth that a propagating target excitation experiences in the presence of one stored gate excitation .",
    "an independent measurement shows that for @xmath230 the atomic density ( time averaged over all gate - target cycles applied to an atomic sample ) decreases as @xmath231 with @xmath232 .",
    "this decrease is due to the fact that each target signal photon that is absorbed in the atomic gas contributes to photon - recoil heating of the gas . in the shallow dipole trap , evaporation converts this into a loss of atoms . as @xmath229 is proportional to @xmath233",
    "we expect @xmath234 @xmath235 is the sum of two contributions .",
