    "the cooling sequence of hydrogen - deficient white dwarfs ( wds ) is populated by different subtypes of this species . at @xmath3 , stars are called do wds .",
    "these objects display mainly at high and a combination of and lines at lower temperatures .",
    "stars with spectra showing only lines are called db wds . prior to the data releases of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the hottest db white dwarf ( wd ) known was pg  0112 + 104 with @xmath4 .",
    "the coolest do wd prior to the sdss on the other hand was pg  1133 + 489 with @xmath5 ( wesemael et al .",
    "these two stars constituted the cool and hot end of the so - called db - gap ( liebert et al .",
    "1986 ) , a temperature region with a deficiency in helium - rich white dwarfs .",
    "the sdss survey was rich in new white dwarfs and brought forth a large number of db and do white dwarfs . in the paper of eisenstein",
    "2006 ) , the authors report a considerable number of h - deficient wds with temperatures that put them in the db - gap . to derive wd temperatures",
    ", they used model atmospheres assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "dreizler & werner ( 1996 ) showed that even for stars with @xmath6 non - local effects are still important .",
    "therefore we re - analysed the sample of eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2006 ) with our non - lte model spectra .",
    "for our non - lte spectral analysis , we have calculated a grid of model atmospheres with the following parameters :    [ cols=\"<,^,<,^ , < \" , ]     our fitting method applied is the same as described in hgelmeyer et al .",
    "it is similar to the one used by koester in eisenstein et al .",
    "we first normalized the sdss spectrum by determining the continuum points of the observations by the continuum of the normalized model spectrum and then fitted a third order polynomial to the double logarithmic data .",
    "we then applied a @xmath7-fit to the normalized models in certain wavelength regions , i.e.  @xmath8  @xmath9   , @xmath10  @xmath11   , and @xmath12  @xmath13   .",
    "our best fit models are shown in figure  2 and the photospheric values are presented in table  1 .",
    "the comparison of our nlte model fits to the temperature values obtained with lte koester models is shown in figure  1 .",
    "our derived temperatures are in better agreement with the fitting method of koester .",
    "this is not very surprising since the procedures are very similar .",
    "the eisenstein ` autofit ` method fits photometric data additionally to the spectroscopy .",
    "the left panel plot in figure  1 shows that our fitting method , especially in the high temperature regime , produces higher @xmath14 values than the eisenstein method .",
    "however , all but two fits  one of which is for an object with a significant amount of hydrogen and therefore can not be reliably fit with our he - rich models are within the 15% deviation range .",
    "the koester fits are in even better agreement with our model fitting",
    ". direct comparison of our non - lte to the lte koester models show some obvious deviations in the continuum flux which increase towards lower temperatures .",
    "currently , we do not have an explanation for these discrepancies .",
    "overall , we can confirm the results of eisenstein et al .",
    "especially the nice agreement of our fits to those of koester at effective temperatures @xmath15 suggests that lte is a valid assumption for the analysis of db - gap white dwarfs .",
