    "superfluidity in interacting bose systems has been a fascinating research topic for several decades . after the achievement of bose - einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases,@xcite many of the remarkable properties of superfluid @xmath0he",
    "were also observed in these weakly interacting systems , such as vortices and josephson oscillations.@xcite in order to understand their superfluid properties , it is necessary to clarify the role of the elementary excitations in determining these properties . according to a celebrated criterion due to landau",
    ", a bose gas without interactions can not be a superfluid , since its spectrum @xmath1 makes it indifferent to galilei transformations .",
    "a superfluid , on the other hand , is resistant to a slowdown of the molecules due to the loss of galilei invariance .",
    "a bose system with the relativistic looking excitation spectrum @xmath2 has this property , thus being a superfluid by landau s argument .",
    "thus , phonon - like excitation spectra are an essential part of a superfluid .    in superfluid helium , which is a strongly interacting bose system , the interatomic potential has an attractive short - range part over a distance @xmath3 , the average interatomic distance .",
    "this sets the scale of a further important set of excitations .",
    "scattering experiments of neutrons show that around a momentum @xmath4 the spectrum behaves like @xmath5 .",
    "these elementary excitations are called rotons .",
    "feynman @xcite was the first to recognize the importance of the rotons for a superfluid .",
    "in modern language , feynman s theory describes rotons as a result of large _ quantum _ phase fluctuations at low temperatures .",
    "these produce small vortex loops of size @xmath6 . at higher temperatures where thermal fluctuations take over ,",
    "the vortex loops combine to larger _ thermally _ excited vortex loops which profit from the high configurational entropy of line - like excitations . at the critical @xmath7-point ,",
    "these loops become infinitely long and destroy the order of the superfluid.@xcite    in two dimensions , phase fluctuations are so strong that they destroy the long - range order at any temperature.@xcite as noted first by kosterlitz and thouless ( kt ) , @xcite there still exists a phase transition driven by phase fluctuations . at low temperature , a film of superfluid @xmath0he contains vortex- antivortex pairs bound by coulomb attraction , whose unbinding causes the kt transition .",
    "one of the most important predictions of this theory is the universal jump to zero of the superfluid stiffness at the critical temperature.@xcite this destroys the excitations of energy @xmath8 , and thus the superfluidity .",
    "the increased relevance of phase fluctuations in two dimensions suggests that feynman s rotons are more abundant than in three dimensions .",
    "we want to argue that this is indeed the case : in spite of the weak interactions , a dilute bose gas possesses roton - like excitations which are the precursors of the high - temperature vortices that lead to a kt phase transition .",
    "this is quite remarkable since , contrary to superfluid helium , the bare interaction does not contribute with an attractive part to fix the size of @xmath9 .",

    "remarkably , in the two - dimensional dilute bose gas at finite temperature , the rpa analysis will lead to closed form analytic results including roton - like excitations . in sect .",
    "iv we discuss the effect of phase fluctuations in the system .",
    "our analysis in this section will allow us to derive the approximate critical temperature of the system as @xmath14 .",

    ".    the consistency of the calculation leading to the spectrum ( [ spec-2d ] ) can be checked by computing the spectrum also from the pole of the anomalous propagator .",
    "it is well known that the pole of the propagator should be the same as the one from the density correlation function,@xcite although most approximations fail to fulfill this requirement .",
    "after analytically continuing to real frequencies , we obtain that the pole of the propagator is given by the solution of the equation @xcite @xmath88 the above equation is a generalization of the bogoliubov result for the excitation spectrum .",

    "( [ pole - prop ] ) with the polarization bubble ( [ pi1 - 2d ] ) gives precisely the energy spectrum ( [ spec-2d ] ) .",
    "the excitation spectrum ( [ spec-2d ] ) has another interesting property in the low - momentum regime , which for @xmath90 is defined by @xmath91 in the above low - momentum regime the logarithm gives rise to an _ anomalous _ power behavior @xmath92 the exponent of @xmath85 in ( [ spec - lowp ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the superfluid mass density at zero temperature , and @xmath95 .",
    "interestingly , precisely the same exponent arises in the spin wave treatment of _ classical _ phase fluctuations in the study of the kt transition .",
    "we will revisit this analysis in the next section , where it will also be shown that despite the anomalous scaling of the spectrum , the kt transition occurs as usual at higher temperatures , in agreement with the discussion of ref .  .",

    "it is instructive to calculate the low - momentum contribution to the superfluid density following from ( [ spec - lowp ] ) .",
    "since vortices are not included in the above calculation , the result will show only the anomalous phonon contribution to the so called background superfluid density , @xmath100 .",

    "( [ 2d - green ] ) is crucial in the kt argument in the presence of vortices .",

    "( [ fourier ] ) must be positive in order to make the above result well defined at large distances .",
    "this gives us once more the upper bound for @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "the lower bound for @xmath13 follows from the asymptotic behavior of the bessel function for @xmath149 large , @xmath150 thus , the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) behaves for large @xmath149 like @xmath151 and it follows that in order to avoid a power - like ultraviolet divergence we must have @xmath152 , which leads to @xmath153",
    ". therefore , in order to have a well defined mass density @xmath154 the inequality @xmath146 has to be fulfilled .",
    "note that the upper bound is associated to a large distance ( infrared ) divergence while the lower bound is to short distance ( ultraviolet ) divergence .",
    "we have already seen that saturation of the upper bound leads to the determination of the temperature @xmath15 . on the other hand",
    ", we will give arguments below showing that saturation of the lower bound determines the actual critical temperature of the system .    at higher temperatures , near the phase transition",
    ", we are allowed to keep only the zero matsubara mode , such that the field theory becomes two - dimensional .",
    "the vortices are introduced in the standard way,@xcite and a duality transformation gives the following generalized sine - gordon action for the dual field theory of vortices : @xmath155,\\ ] ] where @xmath156 and @xmath157 is the fugacity of the gas of point vortices .",
    "a derivation of the action ( [ sg ] ) is given in appendix b. nonlocal gradient terms in sine - gordon theory have recently been discussed in a different context,@xcite where a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis shows that a local gradient term @xmath158 with a _ positive _ coefficient is generated.@xcite the nonlocal contributions can be rewritten as a sum of higher - gradient terms which are all irrelevant at large distances .",
    "let us state this in more simple terms .",
    "in momentum space the non - local gradient has the form @xmath159}\\varphi({\\bf p})\\varphi(-{\\bf p}).\\ ] ] thus , as a local gradient term is generated , we have that for small @xmath85 ( large distances ) the @xmath160-term dominates over the @xmath161}$ ] one and the anomalous contribution can be neglected .",
    "this argument shows that the dual theory ( [ sg ] ) actually has a kt transition , since the fluctuation generated @xmath160-term is dominant in the infrared , leading effectively to a sine - gordon theory of the usual type .",
    "thus , our theory will ultimately be in agreement with the analysis of ref . where no anomalous dimension arising from rpa corrections is considered .    in the low - temperature phase , where @xmath162 , the hydrodynamic description via the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) breaks down , since the inverse fourier transform of @xmath163 is no longer defined",
    "this regime is equivalent to the one in the dual theory where the non - local gradient term becomes irrelevant .",
    "this means that the effective hamiltonian of the classical theory in this range of temperatures is actually given by ( [ heff - local ] ) .",
    "in other words , when the anomalous sine - gordon theory becomes at large distances effectively the usual sine - gordon theory ( remember that a local gradient term is generated by fluctuations ) , we can dualize it back to obtain the _ effective _ original theory as given by eq .",
    "( [ heff - local ] ) .    in a kt transition",
    "the critical temperature @xmath115 is determined from the equation @xmath164 , or equivalently , @xmath165.@xcite note that @xmath13 corresponds to a low - temperature approximation to @xmath144 .",
    "thus , we can interpret that saturating the lower bound in the spin - wave inequality @xmath146 leads to an approximate value of the actual critical temperature for the kt transition .",
    "therefore , we have that @xmath166 we want to emphasize that the agreement of the value of @xmath13 at the lower bound of the inequality @xmath146 with the value @xmath164 obtained from the kt theory is not a simple coincidence .",
    "it follows from the fact that the temperature at which @xmath167 corresponds to the onset of the regime where the non - local term of the generalized sine - gordon theory becomes irrelevant .",
    "we have obtained @xmath13 as a correction to the power of the excitation spectrum at finite temperature by using a _ classical _ approximation to evaluate the density correlation function .",
    "thus , we have simply accounted for a classical effect in a quantum calculation , i.e. , our calculation of the spectrum at finite temperature is actually a semi - classical one . in the kt theory",
    "the value @xmath168 is follows due to a conspiracy between spin - wave theory and the statistical mechanics of vortices .",
    "@xcite in our case , a similar result obtains : our bound for @xmath13 is derived by analysing the non - local spin - wave theory , while the conclusion that @xmath167 determines the critical temperature needs additional analysis involving the vortex field theory ( [ sg ] ) .",
    "a more technical explanation follows by recalling that density and _ longitudinal _ phase fluctuations are related through the ward identities .",
    "@xcite more precisely , in ref .",
    "it is shown that the density correlation function is related through an exact identity to the longitudinal component of the current correlation function , which corresponds to the response of the system to the longitudinal phase fluctuations or , in other words , spin - waves .",
    "since @xmath13 is determined by the density correlation function , by taking the classical limit of this identity we obtain a relation between @xmath13 and the spin - wave response .",
    "the vortices , on the other hand , are related to the _ transverse _ phase fluctuations .",
    "it can be shown@xcite that the transverse component of the current correlation function decouples from all other correlation functions .",
    "this result holds also in the classical limit and that is the reason why the classical statistical mechanics of vortices alone can determine the phase transition",
    ".    from the lower and upper bound to @xmath13 we obtain that the actual @xmath115 obtained from the kt theory is smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , we have that @xmath169 since @xmath170 , it seems to exist a region @xmath171 where the system is not a superfluid , while not being a normal fluid either , due to the anomalous exponent .",
    "this region would be actually very small : from the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) we see that a more correct statement would be to claim the existence of a temperature region @xmath172 where an anomalous normal state occurs .",
    "this state can be thought as a quasi - condensate _ without _ phase coherence . in this respect ,",
    "it bears some resemblance with the pseudogap state in high-@xmath115 superconductors,@xcite in which the phase fluctuations above the superconducting critical temperature play a similar role.@xcite in the pseudogap phase the spectrum is not like the one of a normal metal , although the system is not in a superconducting phase .",
    "however , we should warn the reader that the actual physics of the pseudogap state is likely much more complex and that such an analogy must be considered with utmost caution .",
    "in this paper we have shown that temperature effects induce roton - like excitations in a dilute two - dimensional bose gas . from this result",
    "it followed that for nonzero low temperatures the spectrum _ is not _ of the phonon type and has an anomalous scaling with temperature dependent exponent .",
    "thus , we have obtained in the quantum regime a situation which is reminiscent of the kosterlitz - thouless transition , namely , a continuously varying exponent",
    ".    it would be interesting to extend this analysis to strongly - coupled two - dimensional bose systems such as films of @xmath0he , where experimental data have so far been fitted by a superfluid density whose vortex - independent background contribution is calculated from the bogoliubov spectrum.@xcite it was found that the phonon contribution alone with its @xmath106 behavior ( recall that for a phonon spectrum we find in general a contribution behaving like @xmath173 in @xmath11 dimensions ) is not consistent with the temperature dependence of the data , thus calling for an improvement of the theory . in order to apply our approach to @xmath0he films we must derive the @xmath10-matrix for the actual atomic interaction in helium beyond the dilute limit .",
