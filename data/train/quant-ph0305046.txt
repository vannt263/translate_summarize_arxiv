    "the introduction of `` toy '' mappings that demonstrate essential features of nonlinear dynamics has led to many insights in the field of classical chaos .",
    "a well known example is the so - called _",
    "baker s transformation _",
    "it maps the unit square , which can be thought of as a toroidal phase space , onto itself in an area - preserving way .",
    "interest in the baker s map stems from its straightforward characterization in terms of a bernoulli shift on the binary sequence that specifies a point in the unit square .",
    "it seems natural to consider a quantum version of the baker s map for the investigation of quantum chaos .",
    "there is , however , no unique procedure for quantizing a classical map ; hence , different quantum maps can lead to the same classical baker s transformation .",
    "balazs and voros @xcite were the first to formulate a quantum version of the baker s map .",
    "this was done with the help of the discrete quantum fourier transform .",
    "subsequently , improvements to the balazs - voros quantization were made by saraceno @xcite , an optical analogy was found @xcite , a canonical quantization was devised @xcite , and quantum computing realizations were proposed @xcite .",
    "a related quantum baker s mapping on the sphere has also been defined  @xcite .",
    "more recently , an entire class of quantum baker s maps , based on the @xmath0-dimensional hilbert space of @xmath1 qubits , was proposed by schack and one of us @xcite .",
    "the qubit structure provides a connection to the binary representation of the classical baker s map .",
    "this connection comes through the use of partial fourier transforms , which are used to define orthonormal basis states that are localized on the unit - square phase space .",
    "the @xmath2-th partial fourier transform , which acts on @xmath3 of the qubits , defines orthonormal states that are localized at a lattice of phase - space points specified by @xmath2 position bits and @xmath3 momentum bits .",
    "each state is localized strictly within a position width @xmath4 and roughly within a momentum width @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath2-th quantum baker s map in the class takes the states defined by the @xmath2-th partial fourier transform to the states defined by the @xmath6-th partial fourier transform .",
    "this action decreases the number of position bits by one , while increasing the number of momentum bits by one , thus mimicking the stretching and squeezing of the classical baker s map . by using this procedure ,",
    "one obtains @xmath1 different quantum baker s maps , one map for each number of initial position bits ( or initial momentum bits ) .",
    "the balazs - voros quantization is but one member of this class , corresponding to a single initial position bit ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the map at the other extreme ( @xmath8 ) , which has no initial momentum bits , is easily shown to be unentangling .",
    "the classical limit of this class of baker s maps has been investigated by two groups @xcite .",
    "tracy and one of us @xcite found that if the number of initial momentum bits is allowed to approach infinity as the overall number of qubits goes to infinity , the classical baker s map is recovered .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings of soklakov and schack @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if the number of momentum bits is held constant as the number of qubits increases to infinity , a stochastic variation of the classical baker s map is created @xcite . the simplest such limit , which holds the number of initial momentum bits constant at zero ( @xmath8 ) , follows a sequence of completely unentangling quantum baker s maps .",
    "our curiosity now poses the following two questions .",
    "what is the entangling power of _ all _ the quantum baker s maps ? and what role , if any , does entanglement play in the the classical limit ?",
    "this paper focuses , for the most part , on the first of these questions , investigating the entangling power of the schack - caves class of quantum baker s maps .",
    "previous investigations of entanglement in quantized chaotic systems , for the most part , have dealt with the correlations induced by coupling two or more independent systems together @xcite .",
    "our approach here is quite different : each of our quantum baker s maps lives in a hilbert space with a qubit tensor - product structure ; strings of qubits form a natural basis , anchoring hilbert space to the corresponding classical phase space , and the quantum dynamics of our baker s maps is defined explicitly in terms of this connection .",
    "we therefore expect an intimate relationship between the dynamics and the multipartite entanglement induced amongst the qubits .",
    "using different approaches , the dynamics of entanglement in qubit bases was recently investigated in @xcite .    in order to calibrate the entanglement produced by the quantum baker s map , we compare it with the entanglement of random pure states drawn from the appropriate hilbert space .",
    "thus a by - product of our investigation is to derive some new exact formulae describing the levels of entanglement expected in random pure states . as measures of entanglement",
    ", we examine in detail the subsystem linear entropy , deriving formulae for the variance and third cumulant , and two proposals for a multipartite entanglement measure , where formulae for the mean and variance are given .",
    "pairwise ( mixed - state ) entanglement between two qubits drawn from @xmath1 qubits is investigated numerically , using the _ concurrence _ as the entanglement measure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the baker s map , both in classical and quantal form . section [ sec3 ] is devoted to discussing the measures of entanglement and the entanglement of typical pure states . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we explore the entangling power of the quantum baker s maps . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we provide a brief discussion of our results .",
    "the classical baker s map is a standard example of chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is a symplectic map of the unit square onto itself defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the integer part of @xmath12 , and @xmath2 denotes the @xmath2-th iteration of the map .",
    "geometrically , the map stretches the unit square by a factor of two in the @xmath13 direction , squeezes by a factor of a half in the @xmath14 direction , and then stacks the right half onto the left .",
    "interest in the baker s map is due mainly to the simplicity of its _",
    "symbolic dynamics_. if each point of the unit square is identified through its binary representation , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , with a bi - infinite symbolic string @xmath18 then the action of the baker s map is to shift the position of the dot by one point to the right , @xmath19    for a quantum - mechanical version of the map , we work in a @xmath20-dimensional hilbert space , @xmath21 , spanned by either the position states @xmath22 , with eigenvalues @xmath23 , or the momentum states @xmath24 , with eigenvalues @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the constants @xmath27 determine the periodicity of the space : @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "such double periodicity identifies @xmath21 with a toroidal phase space .",
    "periodic boundary conditions correspond to @xmath30 , and anti - periodic boundary conditions to @xmath31 ; because of other symmetry considerations , these are the only two cases of interest .",
    "the vectors of each basis are orthonormal , @xmath32 , and the two bases are related _ via _ the finite fourier transform , @xmath33 for consistency of units , we must have @xmath34 .",
    "the first work on a quantum baker s map was done by balazs and voros @xcite . assuming an even - dimensional hilbert space with periodic boundary conditions , they defined a quantum baker s map in terms of the unitary operator @xmath35 that executes a single iteration of the map . to define the balazs - voros unitary operator in our notation ,",
    "imagine that the even - dimensional hilbert space is a tensor product of a qubit space and the space of a ( @xmath36)-dimensional system .",
    "writing @xmath37 , @xmath38 , we can write the position eigenstates as @xmath39 , where the states @xmath40 make up the standard basis for the qubit , and the states @xmath41 are a basis for the ( @xmath36)-dimensional system",
    ". the state of the qubit thus determines whether the position eigenstate lies in the left or right half of the unit square .",
    "the balazs - voros quantum baker s map is defined by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the unit operator for the qubit , and @xmath44 is the finite fourier transform on the ( @xmath36)-dimensional system .",
    "the unitary @xmath35 does separate inverse fourier transforms on the left and right halves of the unit square , followed by a full fourier transform .",
    "later saraceno @xcite improved certain symmetry characteristics of this quantum baker s map by using anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "taking again the anti - periodic hilbert space ( which we use throughout the remainder of this paper ) , schack and one of us @xcite introduced a class of quantum baker s maps for dimensions @xmath45 .",
    "for these cases , we can model our hilbert space as the the space of @xmath1 qubits , and the position states can be defined as product states for the qubits in the standard basis , i.e. , @xmath46 where @xmath47 has the binary expansion @xmath48 and @xmath49 .    the connection with the classical baker s map derives from the symbolic dynamics .",
    "the bi - infinite strings  ( [ symbseq ] ) that specify points in the unit square are replaced by sets of orthogonal quantum states created through the use of a partial fourier transform @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the unit operator on the first @xmath2 qubits and @xmath52 is the fourier transform on the remaining qubits .",
    "the partial fourier transform thus transforms the @xmath3 least significant qubits of a position state , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath12 are defined through the binary representations @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in the limiting cases",
    ", we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the analogy to the classical case is made clear by introducing the following notation for the partially transformed states : @xmath59 for each value of @xmath2 , these states form an orthonormal basis and are localized in both position and momentum .",
    "the state @xmath60 is strictly localized in a position region of width @xmath4 centered at @xmath61 and is roughly localized in a momentum region of width @xmath5 centered at @xmath62 . in the notation of eq .",
    "( [ symbseq ] ) , it is localized at the phase - space point @xmath63 .",
    "notice that @xmath64 is a momentum eigenstate and that @xmath65 is a position eigenstate , the @xmath66 being a consequence of the anti - periodic boundary conditions .    ) when @xmath67 : ( a ) @xmath68 , ( b ) @xmath7 , and ( c ) @xmath69 .",
    "the action of the quantum baker s map @xmath70 is to map the four states in ( a ) to the four states in ( b ) , as shown by the numbers labeling the states .",
    "similarly , the action of @xmath71 is to map the states in ( b ) to the states in ( c ) . ]    using this notation , a quantum baker s map on @xmath1 qubits is defined for each value of @xmath72 by the single - iteration unitary operator @xcite @xmath73 where the shift operator @xmath74 acts only on the first @xmath2 qubits , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "notice that since @xmath76 commutes with @xmath77 , we can put @xmath78 in the form @xmath79 since @xmath80 is the unit operator , it is clear that @xmath81 is the balazs - voros - saraceno quantum baker s map  ( [ bv ] ) .    we can also write @xmath82 which shows that the action of @xmath83 is a shift of the @xmath2 leftmost qubits followed by application of the balazs - voros - saraceno baker s map to the @xmath84 rightmost qubits . at each iteration , the shift map @xmath76 does two things : it shifts the @xmath2-th qubit , the most significant qubit that was subject to the previous application of @xmath85 , out of the region subject to the next application of @xmath85 , and it shifts the most significant ( first ) qubit into the region of subsequent application of @xmath86 .",
    "the quantum baker s map @xmath83 takes a state localized at @xmath63 to a state localized at @xmath87 .",
    "the decrease in the number of position bits and increase in momentum bits enforces a stretching and squeezing of phase space in a manner resembling the classical baker s map . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , we plot the husimi function ( defined as in @xcite ) for the partially fourier transformed states ( [ partialfourierstates ] ) when @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , 1 and 0 , respectively .",
    "the quantum baker s map is a one - to - one mapping of one basis to another , as shown in the figure .",
    "one useful representation of our quantum baker s maps , introduced in @xcite , starts from using standard techniques @xcite to write the partially transformed states  ( [ partialfourier ] ) as product states : @xmath88 these input states are mapped by @xmath83 to output states @xmath89 these forms show that the quantum baker s map @xmath83 shifts the states of all the qubits to the left , except the state of the leftmost , most significant qubit .",
    "the state @xmath90 of the leftmost qubit can be thought of as being shifted to the rightmost qubit , where it suffers a controlled phase change that is determined by the state parameters @xmath91 of the original `` momentum qubits . ''",
    "the quantum baker s map can thus be written as a shift map on a finite string of qubits , followed by a controlled phase change on the least significant qubit .",
    "soklakov and schack @xcite have developed this shift representation into a useful tool . using an approach based on coarse graining in this representation , they investigated the classical limit of the quantum baker s maps .",
    "another useful representation of our quantum baker s maps is the qubit ( position ) representation @xmath92\\;,\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 soklakov and schack @xcite have found simplified forms of this qubit representation , suitable for asymptotic analysis of the classical limit .    the classical limit for the above quantum baker s maps has also been investigated in @xcite , using an analysis based on the limiting behavior of the coherent - state propagator of @xmath83 . when @xmath94 , the total number of qubits @xmath1 necessarily becomes infinite , but one has a considerable choice in how to take this limit .",
    "for example , we could use only one position bit , thus fixing @xmath7 , and let the number of momentum bits @xmath95 become large .",
    "this is the limiting case of the balazs - voros - saraceno quantization .",
    "there is , however , a wide variety of other scenarios to consider , e.g. , @xmath96 or @xmath97 as @xmath98 . in @xcite it was shown that provided the number of momentum bits @xmath3 approaches infinity , the correct classical behavior is recovered in the limit .",
    "if the number of momentum bits remains constant , e.g. , @xmath8 as @xmath98 , a stochastic variant of the classical baker s map is found .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained previously by soklakov and schack @xcite .    the special case @xmath8 , which does not limit to the classical baker s map , has other interesting properties . although all finite - dimensional unitary operators are quasi - periodic , the quantum baker s map @xmath99 is strictly periodic , @xmath100 as we show below .",
    "all its eigenvalues , therefore , are @xmath101-th roots of unity , i.e. , of the form @xmath102 , and , hence , there are degeneracies when @xmath103 .",
    "this represents a strong deviation from the predictions of _ random matrix theory _ @xcite .",
    "the property ( [ b4n ] ) can be easily shown by noting that @xmath104 ; i.e. , @xmath105 is a shift followed by application of the unitary @xmath106 to the least significant qubit . on product states",
    ", the action of @xmath105 can be written explicitly as @xmath107 since @xmath108 , we get the property  ( [ b4n ] ) .",
    "one can now also see that @xmath99 can not entangle initial product states .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath109 are @xmath110 , with eigenvalue @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , with eigenvalue @xmath113 .",
    "for the discussion in this paragraph , label these eigenstates by their eigenvalues @xmath114 .",
    "we can construct eigenstates of @xmath105 from tensor products of these eigenstates .",
    "let @xmath115 denote the period of a string @xmath116 under cycling ; for the the corresponding product state @xmath117 , @xmath115 is the smallest positive integer such that @xmath118 .",
    "it is now easy to show that the eigenstates of @xmath105 have the form @xmath119_p^{-k}\\alpha_1\\cdots\\alpha_k\\hat s_n^k \\ket{\\alpha_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes\\ket{\\alpha_n}\\ ; , \\label{eig}\\ ] ] where @xmath120_p$ ] denotes a @xmath115-th root of @xmath121 .",
    "the eigenvalue of the state  ( [ eig ] ) is @xmath122_p$ ] .",
    "notice that the product state @xmath123 ( @xmath114 ) is always an eigenstate , with eigenvalue @xmath121 .",
    "as an example , the eigenstates of @xmath70 are @xmath124 with eigenvalues @xmath125 , @xmath113 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath128 , the action of the quantum baker s map is similar to ( [ bn ] ) , but with a crucial difference .",
    "after the qubit string is cycled , instead of applying a unitary to the rightmost , least significant qubit , a joint unitary is applied to all of the the @xmath84 rightmost qubits .",
    "as discussed above , this joint unitary can be realized as controlled phase change of the least significant qubit , where the control is by the state parameters @xmath91 of the original momentum qubits .",
    "this controlled phase change means that initial product states become entangled .",
    "the resulting entanglement production is the subject of this paper and is investigated in sec .",
    "since the entangling controlled - phase change involves an increasing number of qubits as @xmath2 decreases from @xmath8 to @xmath7 ( the balazs - voros - saraceno map ) , we might expect the entanglement to increase as @xmath2 ranges from @xmath1 to 1 .",
    "what we find , however , is that all the maps for @xmath2 not too close to @xmath1 are efficient entanglement generators , but that the greatest entanglement is produced when @xmath2 is roughly midway between @xmath1 and 1 .    to calibrate our entanglement production results , in the next section",
    "we establish how much entanglement to expect for pure states chosen randomly from the hilbert space . with the entanglement of typical states quantified",
    ", we have a standard against which to compare the entanglement produced by the quantum baker s map .",
    "we might expect the quantum baker s maps to be good at creating typical states in hilbert space , and our work on entanglement production can also be regarded as a way of investigating this expectation .",
    "quantifying the amount of entanglement between quantum systems is a recent pursuit that has attracted a diverse range of researchers @xcite .",
    "the best understood case , not surprisingly , is the simplest .",
    "it is generally accepted that when a bipartite quantum system is in an overall pure state , there is an essentially unique resource - based measure of entanglement between the two subsystems .",
    "this measure is given by the von neumann entropy of the marginal density operators @xcite .",
    "thus an investigation into typical values expected for the _ entropy of entanglement _ seems a worthwhile endeavor in its own right @xcite , which we undertake in sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] .",
    "notice that given an @xmath1-qubit quantum - baked state , there are @xmath129 different possible partitions into the two subsystems , and hence , @xmath129 different entropies of entanglement to consider .",
    "another well understood case is the pairwise entanglement of two qubits in an overall mixed state .",
    "when a bipartite quantum system is in a mixed state , proposals for measuring the entanglement include the _ entanglement of formation _",
    "@xcite , _ distillable entanglement _",
    "@xcite , and _ relative entropy _ @xcite . for pure states all",
    "these reduce to the von neumann entropy , but the first is the best understood for mixed states . in the case of two qubits in a mixed state , an exact expression for the entanglement of formation exists in terms of another measure called the _ concurrence _ @xcite .",
    "thus another entanglement measure to consider could be the concurrence that results after all but two qubits are traced out of an @xmath1-qubit quantum - baked state . section  [ sec3b ] is concerned with this pairwise entanglement .",
    "unlike the above special cases , quantifying the amount of multipartite entanglement in a general multipartite state remains far from being completely understood . there have , nevertheless , been a number of proposals for such a measure . in section [ sec3c ] we investigate two of these .",
    "we must stress , however , that no single measure alone is enough to quantify the entanglement in a multipartite system .",
    "as the number of subsystems increases , so too does the number of independent entanglement measures .      consider a bipartite quantum system with hilbert space @xmath130 of dimension @xmath131 , where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the dimensions of subsystems @xmath134 and @xmath135 , with @xmath136 .",
    "a joint pure state @xmath137 has a schmidt decomposition @xmath138 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are orthonormal bases spanning @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "if we sample random pure states according to the unitarily invariant haar measure , then the schmidt coefficients @xmath143 obey the distribution @xcite @xmath144 where @xmath1 is a normalization constant .",
    "considered as eigenvalues of the marginal density matrices @xmath145 and @xmath146 , the schmidt coefficients give the _ von neumann entropy _ @xmath147 of each subsystem @xmath148 as remarked above , the von neumann entropy is generally considered to be the unique resource - based measure of entanglement for a bipartite quantum system in an overall pure state . given the distribution ( [ distr ] ) , an expression for the average entropy can be calculated : @xmath149 this succinct formula was conjectured by page @xcite and later proved by others @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an expression for the average _ purity _ , @xmath150 had been calculated much earlier by lubkin @xcite : @xmath151 the purity provides the first nontrivial term in a taylor series expansion of the von neumann entropy about its maximum and because of its simplicity , is much easier to investigate analytically . for these reasons we restrict our attention to it .",
    "one can also define a _ linear entropy _ in terms of the purity : @xmath152 we choose the normalization factor so that @xmath153 , i.e. , @xmath154 .",
    "the average linear entropy is @xmath155 which shows that for any division into two subsystems , when the overall dimension @xmath131 is large , a typical state has nearly maximal entanglement .",
    "ideally , we would like an expression for the complete probability distribution @xmath156 of the purity for random pure states .",
    "this function can not , in general , be calculated analytically , so we are forced to settle for formulae describing a few of the cumulants . for subsystems of even moderately high dimension ,",
    "the cumulants we calculate are sufficient to describe accurately the entire distribution @xmath157 . in deriving these cumulants , we follow the work of sen @xcite .",
    "consider the second moment @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "we first remove the obstacle of integrating over the probability simplex by noting that @xmath161 where the new variables @xmath162 take on values independently in the range @xmath163 .",

    "the possibility of nonentangling quantum maps , such as @xmath99 , which produce stochasticity in their classical limit , must also be addressed .",
    "we can apply our results to a preliminary investigation of the relation between entanglement production and the classical limit . as remarked previously",
    ", sequences of quantum baker s maps for which the number of momentum bits , @xmath3 , is held constant do not approach the classical baker s map in the limit @xmath98 , but instead give rise to stochastic variants . to relate this behavior to entanglement production ,",
    "consider the time average of the meyer - wallach entanglement measure @xmath211 , say , @xmath265 where , as before , the average @xmath266 is taken over a uniform distribution of initial product states .",
    "this quantity provides the long time saturation value of @xmath211 and is plotted for all quantum baker s maps up to total of @xmath251 qubits in fig .",

    "one might have expected the saturation value to be suppressed in such limits , but this appears not to be the case .",
    "we tentatively conclude that entanglement production in the qubit bases is unrelated to the creation of a stochasticity in the classical limit .",
    "a similar picture emerges when the subsystem entropy is used as the entanglement measure .    in conclusion",
    ", we have found that the quantum baker s maps are , in general , good at generating multipartite entanglement amongst qubits .",
