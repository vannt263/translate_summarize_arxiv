    "knowledge of the present stellar content and star formation histories of early type galaxies is essential for theories of galaxy evolution and has important consequences for the use of ellipticals in the distance ladder .",
    "a major barrier to divining the nature of luminous elliptical galaxies is the dearth of nearby examples whose stellar populations can be resolved and studied star - by - star .",
    "consequently , considerable effort has been expended in spectral synthesis modeling of the integrated light of early type galaxies ( e.g.  leitherer , et al .",
    "1996 ) , but spectral modeling has not yet clarified the nature of the stellar population of normal giant elliptical galaxies . there is often significant disagreement over even the most fundamental issues of mean age and metallicity among various methods , as was documented by arimoto ( 1996 ) in a blind test of many spectral synthesis methods by independent researchers . resolved stellar population analyses of elliptical galaxies is essential for making real progress .",
    "ground - based color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in the near - infrared by freedman ( 1989 ; 1992 ) and elston & silva ( 1992 ) for the local group high surface brightness , compact dwarf elliptical m32 ( ngc221 ) appeared to exhibit an excess of stars well above the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , evidence for an intermediate age population .",
    "more recent v - i cmds from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) using wfpc2 ( grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) , however , find no direct evidence for this population , apparently an artifact of crowding in the ground - based studies , as was predicted by renzini ( 1992 ) .",
    "after m32 , the next nearest early type galaxy stand - in is the spheroid of ngc5128 .",
    "soria et al .  ( 1996 ) , harris et al .  ( 1999 ) , and marleau et al .  ( 2000 ) have constructed cmds using hst wfpc2 v + i or nicmos j + h images of the outer halo of ngc5128 , detecting the tip of the rgb and plentiful bright asymptotic giants , the latter strongly suggesting an intermediate age population .",
    "maffei  1 , at a distance of @xmath14  mpc ( luppino & tonry 1993 ) , is probably the nearest normal elliptical galaxy ( buta & mccall 2003 ) , but at a galactic latitude of @xmath15 , it is severely obscured by large and highly variable galactic extinction , @xmath16 , making it a very difficult object for study at optical and ir wavelengths .",
    "using ground - based adaptive optics , davidge ( 2002 ) has resolved agb stars in maffei  1 in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands , reaching @xmath19 with errors of @xmath20 magnitudes , but not yet good enough to detect the rgb tip or study the rgb population in detail .",
    "these results are important for understanding early type galaxy populations , but neither m32 nor ngc5128 is a normal , luminous , elliptical galaxy . with m@xmath21 , m32 is at the low luminosity extreme of high surface brightness ellipticals and its proximity to m31 has almost certainly influenced its development ( faber 1973 ; nieto & prugniel 1983 ; bekki et al .",
    "ngc5128 is quite peculiar , a probable recent merger harboring an active galaxy nucleus ( soria et al .",
    "1996 ) and stars as young as 10  myr ( rejkuba et al .  2001 ; 2002 )",
    ". study of maffei  1 is greatly complicated and compromised by the variable foreground galactic dust across its field .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams for these unusual objects can not , without further investigation , be considered representative of the class of standard , luminous ellipticals .",
    "the nearest normal giant elliptical galaxy which can be studied free of complications is ngc3379 in the leo  i galaxy group .",
    "it is an e0 , with typical early type colors , mg@xmath22 index , and velocity dispersion ( davies et al .",
    "it is well fit by an r@xmath23 law ( de vaucouleurs & capaccioli 1979 ) and appears to have no large scale morphological peculiarities ( schweizer and seitzer 1992 ) .",
    "there is some evidence that ngc3379 could be a face - on s0 ( statler & smecker - hane 1999 ; capaccioli et al .",
    "1991 ) , but the evidence is equivocal .",
    "it contains a tiny nuclear dust ring , @xmath24 , and small ionized gas ring , @xmath25 ( pastoriza et al .",
    "2000 ; statler 2001 ) .",
    "this amount of visible interstellar material is small compared to that in the 40% of typical bright ellipticals with gas and dust ( faber et al .",
    "1997 ; sadler & gerhard 1985 ) .",
    "the leo  i group , which also includes the s0 ngc3384 and the sc ngc3389 , is distinguished by its large partial ring of neutral hydrogen ( schneider 1989 ) .    the hst extragalactic distance scale key project ( freedman et al.2001 ) arrives at a distance of @xmath26  mpc ( @xmath27 ) for the leo  i group , somewhat lower than most other estimates ( tanvir et al .",
    "1999 , graham et al .  1997 ; tonry et al .",
    "1990 ; sakai , freedman , & madore 1996 ; see gregg 1997 for a short summary ) . at this distance",
    ", the resolved stellar population of ngc3379 is all but impossible to study with present ground - based instrumentation .",
    "sakai et al .  ( 1996 ) used wfpc2 to obtain i - band images just deep enough to locate the tip of the rgb in ngc  3379 in a field @xmath28 from the center .",
    "while providing a distance estimate of @xmath29 mpc ( @xmath30 ) , marginally consistent with the key project distance , their single filter observations do not constrain the metallicity of the rgb or probe the nature of the agb .",
    "apart from the detection of the rgb tip ( trgb ) by sakai et al .",
    ", everything that is known about the stellar population of ngc3379 has been inferred from spectroscopy and photometry of its integrated light . compiling the spectral line data from a number of recent studies , terlevich & forbes ( 2002 )",
    "have derived age and metallicity estimates for 150 nearby elliptical galaxies , using the stellar population models of worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) .",
    "the mean results for ngc3379 indicate values of @xmath31  gyr and [ fe / h ]  @xmath32 , [ mg / fe ]  @xmath33 , consistent with its having a canonical old , relatively metal - rich stellar population . rose ( 1985 ) , however , has presented arguments based on detailed analysis of integrated light spectral line strengths , that luminous ellipticals , ngc3379 included , have a `` substantial '' intermediate age component , @xmath34  gyr old , though the fraction is not quantified .",
    "these conclusions from integrated spectra are based on single - metallicity population models and so must be viewed with some reservations ; ngc3379 , like most ellipticals , exhibits line strength and color gradients ( davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 ) , indicative of abundance variations ( peletier et al .",
    "1999 ) and hence a composite metallicity population .",
    "a metal - poor component can plausibly account for the relatively young turnoff age reported by rose ( 1985 ) .    using hst with nicmos camera  2 ( thompson et al .",
    "1998 ) , we have resolved the bright rgb and agb stars in three fields in the halo of ngc3379 in the @xmath0 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) filters .",
    "these images have yielded cmds , the first such data for a normal , luminous elliptical galaxy which probe below the rgb tip with some precision .",
    "analysis of these data allow us to place constraints on the mean metallicity of the giant stars and to compare the cmds to those for nearer , relatively well - observed early type populations , such as the milky way bulge and globular clusters , as a first attempt in understanding the star formation history of a typical bright , normal elliptical . by dividing our nicmos observations into two epochs separated by many weeks",
    ", we have identified candidate variable stars in its halo , opening another window on elliptical galaxy stellar populations .",
    "the analysis is summarized as follows : the @xmath2 luminosity function yields the trgb apparent magnitude ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "comparison of the cmd to theoretical isochrones yields a mean abundance which must be near solar @xmath37 ) , irrespective of age . with",
    "the abundance determined , the isochrones provide a distance estimate via the trgb , again with very little age sensitivity ; the largest sources of error are the choice of whose isochrones to use and the binning of the isochrone points at the tip of the rgb , rather than the age or abundance of the stars , or the photometric and statistical uncertainty in the trgb location . with the distance estimate , a more detailed comparison of the cmds to the isochrones reveals a large abundance spread of @xmath38 < + 0.8 $ ] ( @xmath39 ) while no young or intermediate age stars ( @xmath40  gyr ) are required .",
    "the contribution of any population with age @xmath41  gyr is put on more quantitative footing by the number of very bright agb stars , which sets an upper limit of @xmath42 coming from such a population ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "comparison of the ngc3379 cmds to the milky way bulge and globular clusters and ngc5128 supports this analysis ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "while a large age spread in the range 8 to 15  gyrs can not be ruled out by our data , there is no compelling evidence for any significant contribution from stars with ages @xmath45 gyrs .",
    "the locations of our three nicmos camera-2 fields are shown in figure  1 , on the digitized sky survey image of ngc3379 .",
    "the positioning was driven by two factors .",
    "first was to sample a large range in distance from the center so as to be sensitive to any radial variations in stellar population .",
    "the fields are 3  ( 8.7  kpc ) , 45  ( 13.0  kpc ) , and 6  ( 17.5  kpc ) from the nucleus .",
    "the half - light radius @xmath46 of ngc3379 is 54 , so these fields are at 3.33 , 5.0 , and 6.67 @xmath46 with @xmath47-band surface brightnesses of 25.2 , 26.4 , and 27.2 mags/ , respectively ( capaccioli et al.1990 ) .",
    "the somewhat scattered locations were chosen in part to maximize the usefulness of the parallel stis and wfpc2 observations .",
    "unfortunately , the parallel observations were not executed as efficiently as we had hoped and are not deep enough to probe the resolved stellar population of ngc3379 .",
    "observations of each of the three fields were divided evenly between two epochs , spaced 2 - 3 months apart to identify candidate variable stars .",
    "the interval was set by hst scheduling constraints and the desire to have the same orient for follow - up visits , while obtaining all data in a single observing cycle .",
    "a drawback in observing at two epochs was the significant increase in zodiacal light during the second visits .",
    "the overall background was roughly twice as high , completely consistent with the variation in zodiacal light due to the object - hst - sun viewing angle changing from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "data were taken using @xmath50s multiaccum spars64 integration sequences ; the fields were dithered by a few pixels between sequences .",
    "the total integration time spent in each filter for each field is 11.2  ksec ( 8 multiaccum sequences ) .",
    "we initially planned to divide the exposure times between @xmath2 and @xmath0 with a 5:3 ratio .",
    "after the first epoch observations , however , it was evident that we were not obtaining sufficient depth in @xmath0 , so the second visits were used to equalize the total exposure times in the two filters .",

    "a string of background galaxies is visible in the middle field .",
    "the outermost field is of very limited value because it is so sparsely populated with stars , partly because of its extreme outer location but also because it is most impacted by the higher noise levels and reduced effective exposure times due to saa cr persistence .",
    "this is quite unfortunate because this field overlaps with the previous wfpc2 @xmath51-band observations .",
    "this nicmos location detects so few stars , in fact , that comparison with the optical data is useless .",
    "point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting photometry was performed using standard iraf / daophot procedures , after masking out obvious background galaxies and the nicmos coronograph hole .",
    "attempts to construct a reliable psf model from the data were not successful primarily because crowding raised the noise level in the wings of the bright , well - exposed stars to unworkable levels .",
    "instead , we used the tiny tim package ( krist 1993 ) to construct nicmos @xmath0 and @xmath2 psfs .",
    "we added `` jitter '' to the tiny tim models until we reproduced the well - determined cores of the empirical psfs in the final drizzled images .",
    "because of the better - behaved profile wings , the model psfs gave much better results when used in the daophot routines , judging from the lower residuals in the subtracted images and the much lower photometric errors .",
    "we used apertures of 2.5 ( @xmath0 ) and 3.0 ( @xmath2 ) pixels radius to measure the instrumental magnitudes in each drizzled image .",
    "objects were found independently in @xmath0 and @xmath2 and then matched with a cutoff distance of two drizzled pixels , allowing for possible small registration errors , geometric distortions , and noise . using modeled psfs for the photometry made determination of the aperture corrections straightforward ; from the measurement aperture to a 05 radius ( 13.33 drizzled pixels ) required an @xmath0 correction of @xmath52 magnitudes while the @xmath2 correction is @xmath53 .",
    "these magnitudes were then corrected to `` infinite '' apertures with the standard factor of 1.15 .",
    "we adopted the nicmos data handbook `` vega magnitude '' zeropoints of 1775.0 mjy in @xmath0 and 1040.7 mjy in @xmath2 .",

    "omitting the variables , nearly all of which are probably agb rather than rgb stars ( see @xmath706.1.4 ) , increases the significance of this break in the luminosity function ; the rgb tip bin has more than 2.5 times as many non - variables as the next brighter bin .",
    "the field  2 distribution shows a similar but not as prominent break in the next fainter bin , @xmath71 magnitudes . as both fields are at the same distance , this shift , if real , could indicate a modest metallicity difference of @xmath72  dex ( see @xmath73 ) , but with the small number of stars in field  2 , this is not highly significant .",
    "the summed lf is shown in the bottom panel ; the two histograms again being with and without the variables from field  1 . in the combined lf ,",
    "the significance of the rgb tip break remains roughly the same as for field  1 alone ( 2.50 times as many nonvariable stars as the next brighter bin ) , even though we are unable to flag variables in field  2 .",
    "the slope of the lf is close to linear over the brightest magnitude of the rgb , as shown by the dashed line fit to the nonvariables in figure  7 .",
    "this fit predicts that the first bin brighter than the rgb tip should contain more than twice as many stars as observed ( 37 vs.18 ) .",
    "a blow - up histogram of the break region is shown in the inset ; the bin size is reduced to 0.01 magnitudes . even at this fine scale , there is an obvious increase in the numbers of stars in each bin beginning at @xmath74 . in the inset ,",
    "the median number of stars per bin brighter than this is 2 ; fainter is 6 , firmly placing the rgb tip magnitude at a level where the formal photometric errors are only @xmath75 magnitudes per star .",

    "we have assessed uncertainties in two ways : ( 1 ) by bootstrap resampling the data and re - performing the fit and ( 2 ) by creating simulated data sets with realistic magnitude errors and known lfs and carrying maximum - likelihood fits to verify that the input parameters can be recovered .",

    "the monte - carlo simulations allow us to determine if the fitting procedure introduces any bias . in our simulations ,",
    "data points are drawn from a model distribution function and scattered with a magnitude - dependent error derived from the real data data : @xmath87 ten thousand data sets with the same number of data points as the observed sample are created and best - fit model parameters determined using the identical maximum - likelihood procedure that was applied to the real data .",
    "we tried input models with a range of parameters similar to the true data .",
    "as a typical example , for a model with parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we recover in 10000 monte - carlo iterations @xmath90 ignoring the magnitude errors in performing the maximum - likelihood fits thus does not appear to introduce any significant bias in the results .",
    "the dominant source of error in the rgb tip magnitude is likely to be the 5% systematic uncertainty in the nicmos photometric calibration .",
    "departure of the true shape of the lf relative our the simple model of a sharp discontinuity  due to binaries , stellar rotation , variability , and the finite metallicity spread , for example  is another possible source of systematic error for the trgb - distance technique .    while in principle",
    "the lf in @xmath0 might provide additional information on the trgb location , the tip is much less pronounced in @xmath0 . in @xmath91 , it will be shown that ngc3379 has a large abundance spread .",

    ", there are 98 stars in the bins brighter than the tip ; 38 of these ( 39% ) are variable candidates .",
    "these will be discussed further in the next section , along with the implications for the distance and stellar population of ngc3379 .",
    "also in field  1 , there is an excess of stars in the bin centered at @xmath93 , which , in the summed lf becomes another apparent break : the lf jumps by a factor of 1.65 , then falls again .",
    "this excess is not as statistically significant as the brighter rgb tip break , and occurs in just one or two bins .",
    "taking the average number of nonvariables in the bins on either side of this feature predicts 85 stars whereas 109 are seen , about a @xmath94 difference .",

    "this leaves open the somewhat unlikely possibility that the halo comprises mainly very metal rich intermediate age stars .",
    "additional age constraints based on the cmd come from consideration of the observed agb , which is better fit by the older ( @xmath104 gyr ) isochrones of girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , as will be shown in @xmath43 .    the solar abundance , 8 , 10 and 14/15  gyr isochrones of either set bracket the rgb ridge line down to @xmath105 .",
    "at this magnitude , the observed rgb begins to get bluer .",
    "the blueward trend is from incompleteness in the @xmath0 band and the onset of confusion close to the limit of the data ( appendix a ) .",
    "the brightest 0.5 magnitude of the rgb of the solar bc isochrones do not track the observed ridge line as well as the corresponding girardi isochrones .",
    "the isochrones thus constrain the _",

    "age is likely to be in the range @xmath106  gyr , probably very close to 10  gyr .",
    "given the relatively small offsets in color due to age in the @xmath6 colors , and the relatively large observed width of the rgb , a considerable spread in age above @xmath107  gyr can not be ruled out .",
    "a metallicity close to solar is perhaps surprising so far out in the halo , even of a giant elliptical .",
    "one possible explanation for the high abundance is that nicmos is measuring the brightest , most metal rich stars .",
    "looking at the cmds and isochrones in figures  9 and 11 , the metal poor populations are fainter and bluer .",
    "stars with [ fe / h]@xmath108 will drop below the sensitivity range of the observations .",
    "the mean abundance of the _ measured _ stars is close to solar , but a deeper census might reveal the existence of a bluer , much lower abundance population with [ fe / h]@xmath109 .",
    "this effect is the opposite of what happens in the optical where @xmath110 ( and even @xmath51 ) band rgbs become fainter with increasing metallicity , leaving just the metal poor stars to be measured in shallow observations , resulting in a lower mean abundance . with the present nicmos data we may be overestimating the mean metallicity .",
    "complementary deep @xmath110 and @xmath51 band observations with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , especially leveraged against these and/or additional nicmos fields , are required to document the full extent of the metallicity spread in ngc3379 .",

    "adopting the solar metallicity , 10  gyr isochrone as the best fit , the implied distance modulus to ngc3379 is 30.10 ( 10.4  mpc ) for the bc isochrone , @xmath112 greater for the girardi isochrone .",
    "the major contributors to the uncertainty in distance are the nicmos photometric calibration and the isochrone differences .",

    "isochrones are systematically brighter and redder than those of bc , the solar 10 gyr rgb tip in particular by 0.08 magnitudes .",
    "much of this difference could arise from the coarseness of the isochrone sampling of the rgb in steps of @xmath114 magnitudes .",
    "both the nicmos calibration and the isochrone differences are systematic in nature and we conservatively add them linearly to derive a total uncertainty .",
    "the total error in the distance estimate is @xmath115 magnitudes , only 7% in distance , almost entirely from the uncertainties due to systematic differences between the theoretical isochrones and the nicmos absolute photometric calibration , not the data .",
    "averaging of the two isochrone sets leads to @xmath116 ( 10.67  mpc @xmath117 ) as the distance for ngc3379 .",
    "our estimated @xmath100 error includes the full covariance of the trgb magnitude with respect to the other parameters in the model , but does not include possible systematic effects due to the abundance spread , which we have not included in the maximum - likelihood analysis in @xmath97 .",

    "the better match of the upper rgb and the better representation of the brighter agb stars by the girardi isochrones supports a preference for an increase in the distance to @xmath118 ( 10.86  mpc ) ; a positive choice of one set of isochrones over the other also removes a contribution of 0.08 magnitudes to the systematic errors , which would reduce the error estimate to @xmath119 magnitudes .",

    "the metal poor isochrones are not a good match to the mean rgb of ngc3379 , but provide constraints on the metallicity spread . from examining the isochrone sets in figure  10 , it is clear that it is impossible to account for the rgb width solely with an age spread ; most or all of the intrinsic width must be due to a spread in abundance . in figure  11 ,",
    "over - plotted on the field  1 ridge and dispersion lines are bc and girardi 10  gyr isochrones for a range of abundance , all shifted to the same distance modulus , 30.10 for bc and 30.18 for girardi . in both isochrone sets ,",
    "the lower abundance rgb tips have lower luminosity and are shifted to bluer colors , naturally tracing the blue envelope of the observed rgb stars .",
    "a range of metallicity will thus increase the intrinsic ( and observed ) width of the rgb at fainter magnitudes , even without a contribution from increasing photometric errors , because there simply are no extremely metal - poor rgb stars brighter than @xmath122 .",
    "the super - solar bc isochrone also has a somewhat fainter rgb tip luminosity , perhaps signaling the same effect on the high metallicity side .",
    "consequently , the isochrones predict that for a heterogeneous abundance stellar population , the _ spread _ in metallicity will be a function of magnitude over the upper @xmath123 magnitudes of the rgb .",
    "the color distributions in four 0.5 magnitude intervals beginning at the rgb tip are plotted in figure  12 .",
    "over - plotted on each is a best - fit gaussian with the same standard deviation and median , normalized to the total number of stars .",
    "the upper abscissa is an approximate metallicity scale computed simply by dividing the isochrone metallicity range ( 2.1 dex ) by the color difference at the central @xmath2 in each interval .",
    "this is approximate and plotted merely for reference ; the change in color is not strictly a linear function of abundance , nor constant as one goes down the rgb .    for comparison , we also plot gaussians at the mean color location of the 10  gyr bc isochrones with [ fe / h ] = @xmath124 .",
    "each has a @xmath100 width equal to the spread in color caused by crowding and photometric errors , as determined by our artificial star tests ( appendix a ) .",
    "the peaks are simply scaled to the local value of the total gaussian fit and so these are meant to be suggestive only ; the abundance distribution of the stellar population is , as far as we can tell from our data , continuous .",
    "the near absence of any contribution from extremely metal - poor blue stars in the brightest interval is evident , as discussed above .",
    "such blue stars become numerous at magnitudes @xmath125 , once the tip of the fainter metal - poor rgb enters the plots .",
    "the presence of stars redder than the [ fe / h]@xmath126 isochrone implies a very metal - rich population .",
    "the intrinsic width of the color distributions increases gradually from 0.21 to 0.31 magnitudes over the three brightest intervals , but does not increase further in the faintest , suggesting that we may be seeing the full extent of the abundance spread , but deeper data are required to confirm this .",
    "the faintest interval is essentially confusion limited ( see appendix a ) , however , so while it is consistent with the next brighter interval , it can not bear much weight in the analysis .    using the color - to - metallicity conversions computed from the isochrones , the metallicity spreads in each 0.5 magnitude interval on the rgb are @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath129  dex .",
    "the tail to very red objects , @xmath130 is perhaps due to unresolved galaxies .",
    "there is a suggestion of a break in the middle two color histograms at @xmath131 , perhaps an indication of the transition between the stellar population and the background galaxies .",
    "the blueward trend of the most metal - rich isochrones with fainter magnitudes combined with photometric errors may produce this break on the red side .",
    "extrapolating from the bc isochrones , we estimate that this color corresponds to [ fe / h]@xmath132 .",
    "stars this metal - rich have been shown to exist in the inner milky way halo ( rich 1986 ; minniti et al .",
    "1995 ; sadler , rich , & terndrup 1996 ) , coexisting with extremely metal poor objects of @xmath133 = -2 $ ] ( blanco 1984 ) , similar to the situation we find in ngc3379 .",
    "the characteristics of the agb population evolve with age and are a function of metallicity , so in principle the agb can be a stellar populations diagnostic . to be useful ,",
    "though , the agb contribution must somehow be separated from the rgb , which is problematic when photometric errors and stellar physics cause them to completely overlap fainter than the rgb tip .",
    "stars significantly brighter than the rgb tip , however , can be relatively easy to isolate ; work by mould & aaronson ( 1979 ) showed that such agb stars mark the presence of intermediate age populations , @xmath134  gyr . yet the existence of stars up to @xmath11 magnitude brighter than the rgb tip in metal rich galactic globular clusters ( guarnieri , renzini , & ortolani 1997 ) , advises caution in interpreting such stars as an unambiguous signal of younger populations .",
    "the behavior of the agb in the girardi isochrones ( figures  10 , 11 ) also shows that stars brighter than the rgb tip by up to @xmath11 magnitude can be expected even in ancient populations .",
    "we find 98 stars above the tip of the rgb in field  1 ( table  3 , figure  9 ) , 38% of which are variable , and an additional 19 bright stars in field  2 , plus one more in field  3 .",
    "all but 13 of these are within 0.6 magnitudes of the rgb tip .    to test the conclusions from @xmath135 that the population of ngc3379 is old and solar metallicity , we computed theoretical lfs using a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) using the girardi 5 , 10 , and 14 gyr solar isochrones .",
    "the resulting comparison with the observed @xmath2 lf is necessarily approximate as the isochrones are sampled in uneven mass bins determined by theoretical considerations while the observed lf has been computed in equal magnitude bins .",
    "we have not interpolated the isochrones because this smooths out sharp features such as the rgb tip and also because the isochrones are not monotonic functions in luminosity in regions of interest , making interpolation problematic . fortuitously , the isochrone mass intervals correspond to magnitude intervals of 0.1 to 0.15 along the rgb .",
    "we have , however , rebinned the theoretical agb lf to the same magnitude intervals as the theoretical rgb to permit easy summing and have scaled the total lfs by eye to give an approximate match to the observed lf ( figure  13 ) .",
    "the 10 or 14 gyr isochrones , or a composite , can account for the agb stars up to 0.6 magnitudes brighter than the rgb tip .",
    "these stars then do not require an intermediate age or younger population in ngc3379 .",
    "any claim of such a population would rest on the 13 yet brighter agb stars ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "such stars are predicted by the 5  gyr isochrone , but the numbers of observed agb stars above the trgb limit any 5  gyr contribution to @xmath42 of the total .",
    "the brightest agb stars are more naturally explained by a contribution from the substantial [ fe / h]@xmath137 component needed to account for the metallicity spread ( c.f .",
    "figure  11 ) ; this population will generate agb stars up to 0.8 magnitudes above the rgb tip .",
    "blends of stars in the images , or even evolving blue straggler or mass transfer binaries are also viable explanations for these few extremely bright agb stars . we conclude that there is no compelling evidence for any substantial population with an age @xmath138  gyr .",
    "an explanation for the second lf break at @xmath139 also emerges : it is the top of the stably evolving agb . between @xmath139 and the rgb tip ,",
    "the agb stars in the girardi isochrones evolve rapidly , thinning out the agb lf , and it is in this region that they exhibit non - monotonic luminosity behavior . the 10 and 14 gyr ages reproduce this feature somewhat better than the 5 gyr model , suggesting that the structure of the lf may be useful in constraining the age of the observed population .",
    "detailed comparisons require isochrones more finely sampled in mass ( luminosity ) and perhaps also better statistics in the observed stars .",
    "comparison of the nicmos data for ngc3379 to the theoretical isochrones of bc and girardi has resulted in a consistent , perhaps even plausible , picture of the stellar populations in the halo of a giant elliptical .",
    "we next compare the data to similar observations of various well - studied stellar systems .",
    "the stellar population of galactic globular clusters is simple , well understood , and has much ir data available . though the milky way bulge population is less well - determined , high quality ir data exists and provides another point of comparison for a system which is perhaps more similar to ngc3379 .",

    "the overall stellar population of ngc3379 resembles a collection of old galactic globular clusters having a wide distribution of metallicities , but including a significant contribution from super - solar abundance stars .",
    "if the large abundance spread and the significant population of metal poor stars extends to the central regions of ngc3379 , then this must be taken into account when modeling and interpreting the integrated spectrum , where the infamous age - metallicity degeneracy problem is acute .",
    "this investigation has merely scratched the surface of what is now possible to glean from detailed , star - by - star analyses of stellar populations at this distance .",
    "exploring the metallicity range in more detail , especially the metal poor stellar population , awaits deep optical imaging with the advanced camera for surveys on hst .",
    "determining the periods and period distribution of the luminous ir variable stars is the most sensitive way to better constrain any intermediate age population , and this can be done with nicmos or , eventually , with ground - based adaptive optics observations .",

    ", we used the daophot routine addstar to implant artificial stars in the reduced images of field  1 . in each trial , 100 stars of a given @xmath2 magnitude and having a color of 1.1  about @xmath100 to the blue of the mean rgb color  were inserted on a @xmath163 grid , roughly evenly spaced over the image .",
    "fifty sets of @xmath0 , @xmath2 image pairs were made for each input @xmath2 magnitude , ranging from 22.75 to 26.5 in steps of 0.25 magnitudes .",
    "the locations of the artificial stars were randomly perturbed within a 20 pixel radius for each run , but held fixed within each @xmath164 image pair .",
    "each of the 13 magnitude intervals then has 5000 artificial stars of known input brightness and color .",
    "a second and equally extensive trial was made with stars having a color of 1.5 , about @xmath100 to the red of the mean rgb .",
    "the same reduction procedure described above for the real data was used to find and measure all the stars in each artificial star image ; and then compared to the input artificial star lists .",

    "the mean recovered @xmath2 magnitudes at this level are too bright by @xmath165 magnitudes because of faint stars blending to increase the measured brightnesses .",
    "the mean recovered colors of the inserted @xmath166 stars are somewhat less affected : those with @xmath167 ( @xmath168 magnitudes bluer than the mean rgb ) , are on average measured to be too red by 0.05 , while those with @xmath169 ( @xmath168 magnitudes redder than the mean rgb ) are found to be too blue on average by 0.07 magnitudes . at the rgb tip itself ,",
    "the systematic error due to crowding is only 0.01 magnitudes in brightness or color , thus crowding has no significant effect on the distance estimate . at faint magnitudes , the mean recovered color of both the red and blue star tests converge at @xmath170 , which we take to be the color of the unresolved faint star background .",
    "fainter than an input magnitude of @xmath105 , the recovered magnitudes saturate at @xmath171 , signaling the confusion limited reliability level of the data .    the spread in color of the recovered artificial stars",
    "is nearly as great as the observed spread , but this results from the combined effects of crowding and the intrinsic color spread of the real stars . to determine the amount of spread in the rgb directly caused by crowding , we created two new artificial images .",
    "beginning with the residual noise images left after psf subtraction by allstar , we added back artificial stars at the same locations as all the detected stars ; for the @xmath2 image , we used the detected magnitudes , effectively reconstructing the original @xmath2 image , but with a little extra poisson noise which addstar includes . for the @xmath0 image",
    ", we added stars at all the locations of the detected stars , but adjusted their magnitudes so that _ every _ star had the same color , @xmath172 , about the mean of the rgb .",
    "running the daophot suite on these images in a manner identical to that used on the real data produces the cmd in figure  a1 ; this figure should be compared to the real data cmd of figure  9 .",
    "the recovered spread of the artificial rgb is greater than the median photometric errors , but is quite a bit less than the observed rgb width of ngc3379 .    in figure  a2 ,",
    "we compare the artificial data color spread to the actual observed color spread , using the same magnitude intervals as in figure  12 .",
    "the quadrature difference in color spread between the real and artificial images is our estimate of the intrinsic width of the rgb .",
    "the intrinsic color spread increases from 0.20 at the rgb tip to 0.30 at the limit of our data ; this is consistent with the presence of a very metal poor population entering at fainter magnitudes , as predicted by the isochrones in a composite metallicity population ( c.f .",
    "figure  11 ) .    the artificial rgb should have a mean color of exactly 1.3 , but the measured color moves 0.06 magnitudes bluer at @xmath173 , where we are 80% complete , and 0.16 magnitudes bluer in the confusion - limited regime .",
    "the reddest faint stars go undetected in @xmath0 , which causes the shift to bluer colors and accounts for the difference between the mean location of the observed rgb and the girardi isochrones at faint magnitudes ( figures  10 , 11 ) .",

    "<S> lacking period determinations , the exact nature of these variables remains uncertain , but the bright agb stars and variables are similar to those found in metal rich globular clusters and are not luminous enough to imply an intermediate age population . </S>",
    "<S> all of the evidence points to a stellar population in ngc3379 which is very similar to the bulge of the milky way , or an assortment of galactic globular clusters covering a large metallicity spread . </S>"
