    "the goal of low - energy nuclear physics is to understand nuclei and how they react .",
    "this fascinating science problem is relevant to other fields and to a gamut of societal applications .",
    "new vistas have been opened by experimental advances in the production of rare isotopes @xcite and new theoretical approaches @xcite backed by unprecedented computing power @xcite .",
    "the rapid experimental developments have resulted in a wealth of unique data from previously unexplored regions of the nuclear landscape .",
    "this situation poses a serious challenge to models of nuclear structure and calls for their improved reliability and better - controlled extrapolability .    theorists seek to formulate a coherent framework for nuclear structure and reactions based on a well - founded microscopic theory that would deliver maximum predictive power with well - quantified uncertainties . to this end , the steady increase in computing power , currently crossing the petaflop barrier , has been beneficial .",
    "a paradigm for the new mode of nuclear theory is the scidac universal nuclear energy density functional ( unedf ) project @xcite , an example of the close alignment of the physics research with the necessary applied mathematics and computer science research .",
    "this study is the fruit of such a partnership , under unedf , in which physicists collaborate with mathematicians and computer scientists on a specific science challenge .",
    "our long - term goal in unedf is to develop a spectroscopic - quality theoretical framework rooted in the nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . in the first phase of the project",
    ", we have developed efficient dft solvers for the self - consistent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) problem .",
    "various improvements that we have implemented to carry out large - scale dft calculations have been recently presented in @xcite .",
    "these improvements enable comprehensive mass - table calculations , including all even - even nuclei and many different configurations in odd - even and odd - odd nuclei , in less than a day @xcite .",
    "the second phase of the project concerns the development and optimization of the nuclear energy density functional ( edf ) . since standard functionals are clearly too restrictive",
    "when one is aiming at a quantitative description @xcite , the form of edf needs to be improved .",
    "novel functionals can be constructed from two- and three - nucleon interactions by using effective field theory and the density matrix expansion technique @xcite and by using constraints from ab initio calculations for very light nuclei and nuclear matter . they can also be obtained by enriching density dependence and adding higher gradient terms in a systematic way @xcite .",
    "having determined the form of the edf , one must still optimize the coupling constants of the underlying energy density ( ed ) .",
    "indeed , all energy functionals , irrespective of their theoretical foundations , rely on parameters that must be directly fitted to experimental data .",
    "it has been realized recently that high - performance computing can positively impact the optimization strategy .",
    "historically , most nuclear ed parameterizations , such as skyrme or gogny , were obtained by a direct fit to selected experimental data from finite nuclei and various nuclear matter properties ( nmps ) .",
    "observables commonly included in the fit are binding energies , proton radii , surface thickness , and/or single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "energies of doubly closed - shell nuclei as well as nmps ( pseudo - observables ) such as energy per particle of infinite and semi - infinite nuclear matter , saturation density , or incompressibility .",
    "this is the case , for example , for the sly4 parameterization of the skyrme functional of @xcite , which we take ( somewhat arbitrarily ) as a reference point in our study .",
    "the d1 and d1s parameterizations of the gogny interaction have also been obtained in such a framework @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more thorough discussion of various fitting strategies and protocols .",
    "in fact , very few examples of eds are fitted to other types of data . for skyrme",
    "edfs only , we mention the early attempt of the skm * parameterization @xcite , which was adjusted semi - classically to account for the fission barrier of @xmath0pu .",
    "the brussels - montreal set of edfs has been optimized to data on deformed nuclei , although the actual fit is always performed with a spherical code by using a multistep procedure .",
    "for example , in the early versions msk1-msk6 , the deformation energy of the ground - state configuration was used to renormalize nuclear masses so that the optimization could proceed in spherical symmetry @xcite . similarly , while in the later version hfb14 , data on fission barriers were used , the core part of the fitting procedure was carried out in spherical geometry @xcite . for sly4 itself ,",
    "several parameters were fixed at values empirically expected to yield a correct description of giant resonance energy centroids in random - phase approximation ( rpa ) calculations , although no such calculation was included in the fit nor any quantitative check performed a posteriori .",
    "the choice to restrict the data set of observables to those pertaining to nuclear matter and spherical nuclei has almost always been dictated by practical considerations : the cost of performing huge numbers of deformed hfb calculations was deemed too high .",
    "it was also rightly argued that the driving terms of the edf could be pinned down by considering spherical nuclei only . with the need for more precision",
    ", however , the limitation to spherical nuclei and nmp is clearly not sufficient .",
    "the advent of supercomputers makes it possible to free ourselves from this restriction .    specifically , the availability of supercomputers has two consequences .",
    "first , one can now include in the set of fit observables data corresponding to deformed nuclei , odd - mass systems , excited states , and so forth .",
    "more comprehensive data sets should better constrain the various channels of the energy functionals , for example , its deformation or spin - polarization properties .",
    "it might soon become possible to directly optimize symmetry - restored edfs @xcite , either in a single - reference @xcite or a multireference @xcite framework .",
    "in addition , in our quest for improved edfs , a key step is to understand various constraints imposed by experimental data on ed parameters and the resulting uncertainty margins .",
    "early attempts to use statistical methods of linear - regression and error analysis @xcite have been revived recently and applied to determine the correlations between ed parameters , parameter uncertainties , and the errors of calculated observables @xcite .",
    "this approach is essential for providing predictive capability and extrapolability and for estimating the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the purpose of this work is to revisit the problem of skyrme ed optimization by ( i ) removing some of the previous limitations with the help of modern computational resources , and ( ii ) applying regression diagnostics methods on the resulting parameterization . to these ends , we perform functional optimization with a model - based method that is particularly adapted to costly function evaluations , such as when the objective function contains the result of hundreds of symmetry - unrestricted hfb calculations . in our model study , we focus on nuclear masses and radii , with a bias toward heavy nuclei . the final ed parameterization is subjected to a fully fledged correlation and sensitivity analysis .",
    "while we do not claim to have found an end - all parameterization of the skyrme edf , we believe that the set of techniques we have applied in this study can pave the way to a universal nuclear edf of spectroscopic quality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - framework ] we briefly present the dft framework used , in particular various parameterizations of the skyrme edf and their relations to nuclear matter properties .",
    "we also discuss the choice of experimental observables .",

    "results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - results ] .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] contains the conclusions of this work .",
    "this section recalls the features of the skyrme - dft theory that are relevant to the optimization problem .",
    "a detailed presentation of the theory itself can be found in , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the main focus of the following discussion is on various parameterizations of the skyrme edf and the selection of experimental observables chosen to constrain ed parameters .      in nuclear dft ,",
    "the total energy of the nucleus is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the local energy density that is supposed to be a real , scalar , time - even , and isoscalar function of local densities and their derivatives .",
    "the skyrme ed can be decomposed into the kinetic term , interaction ed @xmath3 , pairing ed , coulomb term , and additional corrections , such as the center - of - mass term . for the kinetic energy term",
    ", we set @xmath4=20.73553mev@xmath5 . the coulomb hartree term is calculated exactly , while the exchange term is computed by the slater approximation .",
    "the contribution from the center - of - mass correction has the same structure as the kinetic term and leads to a renormalization of the nucleon mass @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "all these prescriptions follow the sly4 parameterization .",
    "the interaction ed can be further decomposed into @xmath7 , with @xmath8 where the isospin index @xmath9 labels isoscalar ( @xmath9=0 ) and isovector ( @xmath9=1 ) densities . since in this work",
    "we limit the discussion to even - even nuclei , the terms involving spin , spin - kinetic , and current densities @xcite are absent .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath10 contain an additional dependence on the isoscalar density of the form @xmath11",
    "the standard skyrme interaction ed therefore contains 13 independent parameters : @xmath12 when dealing with the skyrme interaction edf ( i.e. , the functional that originates from the skyrme interaction ) , the coupling constants ( [ c - parameters ] ) are uniquely related to the well - known @xmath13-parameterization of the skyrme interaction @xmath14 the equations connecting the @xmath15- and @xmath13-parameterization can be found , for example , in @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "nucleonic superconductivity is described by the pairing ed : @xmath16\\breve\\rho^2({\\boldsymbol{r } } ) , \\label{vpair}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the local pairing density and @xmath18=0.16@xmath19 ( mixed - pairing prescription @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath15-representations are natural parameterizations of the skyrme edf , the former in terms of an effective , density - dependent two - body interaction and the latter as a general functional of the density .",
    "however , these representations do not provide a straightforward connection to physical observables ; hence , it is not immediately obvious what the search range for these parameters should be .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to relate them to fundamental properties of symmetric and asymmetric homogeneous nuclear matter , which have a clear physical interpretation and the range of which is known @xcite .",
    "the starting point in the discussion of nmps is the equation of state ( eos ) of the infinite homogeneous nuclear matter : @xmath20 .",
    "the coulomb energy is disregarded , all gradient terms vanish , and the kinetic energy density is replaced by its thomas - fermi expression . assuming an unpolarized system , one can also ignore terms involving time - odd spin densities and currents .    the expansion of @xmath21 around the equilibrium density @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the relative neutron excess , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 in these equations , @xmath30 stands for the total energy per nucleon at equilibrium , @xmath31 represents the nucleonic pressure , @xmath32 is the nuclear matter incompressibility , @xmath33 is the symmetry energy coefficient , @xmath34 represents the density dependence of the symmetry energy , and @xmath35 is a correction to the incompressibility .      in the regime of symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37=0 , which eliminates all isovector terms .",
    "the isoscalar kinetic energy density is @xmath38 the nuclear matter saturation curve @xmath39 is expected to have the following properties : @xmath40 the value of the incompressibility modulus is related to the centroid energies of giant isoscalar monopole resonances in isospin - symmetric nuclei @xcite and is expected to be @xcite @xmath41 with a strong preference for 230mev @xcite .",
    "another important nmp , entering the snm eos indirectly , is the isoscalar effective mass @xmath42 which quantifies the momentum - dependence of the mean field and drives the density of the s.p .",
    "an appropriate value for a fit to experimental s.p .",
    "energies is @xmath43 @xcite , while ab initio calculations performed at the brueckner - hartree - fock level in inm suggest a slightly lower value for the landau ( fermi - level ) effective mass extracted from the on - shell s.p .",

    "mass fits also seem to favor a value close to unity , although significant freedom exists @xcite .",

    "the net result of imposing the bound constraints is that only 10 parameters out of twelve are allowed to change near the end of the optimization process .",

    "[ fig : sens ] corresponds to this approach .",
    "this sensitivity response is compared with that performed at the free minimum @xmath109 of @xmath104 in the full 12-parameter space of unedfnb . since both sets correspond to ( unconstrained )",
    "minima in their respective spaces , the overall changes in @xmath94 are of the same order of magnitude and they are very small , @xmath110 .",
    "this indicates that the set of fit observables has been chosen very consistently .",
    "indeed the mass of deformed @xmath111fm is the single observable that yields the noticeable parameter variations around the unedfnb minimum while in the case of unedfpre@xmath108 no sensitivity to a single piece of data can be noticed .",
    "by contrast , within the alternative ( ii ) , @xmath107 is not an unconstrained minimizer in the full 12-parameter space . in such an approach , we find the overall sensitivity to be about 2 orders of magnitude larger than what is depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : sens ] .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath112 and @xmath113 are far away from the unconstrained minimum in that space , at the same time being strongly correlated with other parameters . in this case , the sensitivities depend strongly on the actual value of @xmath107 and the way the domain is constrained .",
    "for this reason , the option ( ii ) is of no practical interest in the comparison with the no - bounds results .",
    "one of the major challenges for the low - energy nuclear theory is to construct the global nuclear energy density functional of spectroscopic quality , rooted in microscopic theory .",
    "an important element of this program is to optimize the parameters of the functional on a set of experimental observables and selected theoretical pseudo - data .",
    "this work shows how such an optimization can be done by using modern optimization algorithms and nonlinear regression analysis .",
    "the purpose of this study was to optimize the standard skyrme functional based on a set of experimental data ( masses , charge radii , and odd - even mass differences ) pertaining to 72 spherical and deformed nuclei amenable to a mean - field description .",
    "the new model - based optimization algorithm pounders was compared with other standard derivative - free optimization methods such as nelder - mead and was found to be significantly better in terms of speed , accuracy , and precision .",
    "the optimization was carried out at the fully self - consistent , deformed hartree - fock - bogoliubov level . here , we took advantage of the efficient dft solver hfbtho optimized in the first phase of the project .",
    "we have implemented various improvements that enable us to quickly compute global self - consistent mass tables .",
    "this capability is essential for optimization .    as a result of the twelve - parameter optimization of skyrme edf",
    ", we arrived at two solutions .",
    "the first one corresponds to a minimum ( stable point ) in the considered parameter space .",
    "the corresponding functional unedfnb describes well the assumed set of fit observables , but its incompressibility parameter is too large , as this property has not been well constrained by our data set .",
    "the second optimization was carried out assuming hard bounds on the nuclear matter parameters .",
    "for the bound - constrained solution , the nuclear incompressibility and scalar effective mass appear at their respective bounds .",
    "the resulting parameter set unedfpre gives good agreement with experimental masses , radii , and deformations and seems to be free of finite - size instabilities . in particular , for two - neutron separation energies and masses of even - even heavy nuclei with @xmath114 , unedfpre yields the rms deviation of 0.45mev and 1.2mev , respectively , which is a satisfying result .",
    "we emphasize that the original skyrme edfs seem to be inherently limited in this respect , as demonstrated in @xcite , unless specific corrections are introduced .",
    "our result is therefore in line with the best expectations one could have for such edfs .",
    "nevertheless , the lack of specific constraints on the shell structure in our data set implies that single - particle levels of light nuclei are not well reproduced .",
    "for that reason , unedfpre may not yet be recommended for truly global applications across the chart of the nuclides .",
    "however , this functional is expected to work well for heavy nuclei and should be considered as a reference against which more advanced edfs will be benchmarked .",
    "we have also applied full - fledged regression diagnostics on unedfnb and unedfpre , focusing on statistical correlations between ed parameters and the sensitivity of parameters to variations in fit observables . to this end , we computed and analyzed the correlation and sensitivity matrices at the optimal parameter set .",
    "this kind of nonlinear regression analysis is expected to be helpful when designing next generation edfs .",
    "moreover , the statistical tools presented in this study can be used to pinpoint specific nuclear observables that are expected to strongly affect the developments of the nuclear universal density functional .",
