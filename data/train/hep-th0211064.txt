    "we can find that the traditional semi - classical approach fails . in the case of @xmath5 , there is a so - called bounce solution as the classical solution which has a negative mode in the fluctuations .",
    "the negative mode contributes non - zero imaginary part of the spectra in the approximation , showing instability of the system . since the spectra of the model must be real , the instability in the approximation must be _",
    "fake_. in the case of @xmath6 , the classical solution is now an instanton having no negative mode and does not cause fake instability .",
    "however , another difficulty takes place when we sum up the multi - instanton contribution with the aid of the dilute - gas approximation .",
    "the application of this approximation leads to the splitting of the ground - state spectra due to the quantum tunneling , in spite of the fact that the ground - state of the potential ( [ eqn : cubpo ] ) does not degenerate in the tree - level .",
    "as we will see , both the difficulties are circumvented with the aid of the valley method briefly explained in the next section .",
    "furthermore , the system ( [ eqn : cubpo ] ) possesses significant analytic properties at specific values of the parameter , namely , @xmath0-fold supersymmetry and quasi - solvability .",
    "these issues are summarized in section [ sec:7 ] and [ sec:8 ] .",
    "the main problem in quantum theories concerns with the evaluation of the euclidean partition function : @xmath7 } $ ] .",
    "since the evaluation can not be done exactly in general , one must find out a proper method which enables one to get a good estimation of the quantity .",
    "the semi - classical approximation is known to be one of the most established methods .",
    "especially , the uses of instantons have been succeeded in analyzing non - perturbative aspects of various quantum systems which have degenerate vacua  @xcite .",
    "however , validity of the approximation comes into question when the fluctuations around the classical configuration contain a negative mode .",
    "the appearance of a negative mode indicates that the classical action does not give the minimum but rather a saddle point in the functional space . in this case",
    ", one may expect that the path - integral is dominated by the configurations along the negative mode , which may intuitively constitute a _ valley _ in the functional space .",
    "the valley method is a natural realization of this consideration .",
    "at first , we give a geometrical definition of the valley in the functional space @xmath8  @xcite : @xmath9}{\\delta q(\\tau')}\\right)^{2 }   -\\lambda s[q]\\right]=0 .",
    "\\label{eqn : valley1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above definition ( [ eqn : valley1 ] ) can be interpreted as follows ; for each fixed `` height '' @xmath10 $ ] , the valley is defined at the point where the norm of the gradient vector becomes extremal . introducing an auxiliary field @xmath11 , we can make the valley equation ( [ eqn : valley1 ] ) a more perspicuous form : @xmath12}{\\delta q(\\tau)}=f(\\tau),\\quad \\int\\ !",

    "it is now evident that any solution of the equation of motion is also a solution of the valley equation ( [ eqn : valley2 ] ) with @xmath15 .",
    "next , we separate the integration along the valley line from the whole functional integration .",

    "ensure that the subspace does not contain the eigenvector of the eigenvalue @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , we can safely perform the gaussian integrations even when we encounter a non - positive mode .",
    "the extension to the multi - dimensional valley , which will be needed when there are multiple non - positive eigenvalues , is straightforward .",
    "let us investigate the solutions of the valley equation ( [ eqn : valley2 ] ) for the system ( [ eqn : cubpo ] ) .",
    "in the case of @xmath6 , the three local minima of the potential ( [ eqn : cubpo ] ) have the same potential value .",
    "thus , there are ( anti-)instanton solutions of the equation of motion which describe the quantum tunneling between the neighboring vacua : @xmath24 when @xmath25 , the classical solutions drastically change into the so - called bounce solutions which cause fake instability . on the other hand ,",
    "the solutions of the valley equation ( [ eqn : valley2 ] ) contain a continuously deformed ( anti-)instanton which connects the two non - degenerate local minima and is called _ ( anti-)valley - instanton _  @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the valley equation ( [ eqn : valley2 ] ) also contain a family of the configurations , which tends to the trivial vacuum configuration in the one limit and tends to well - separated valley - instanton and anti - valley - instanton configuration in the other limit .",
    "the latter configuration is called @xmath26-valley .",
    "the bounce solution is also realized as an intermediate configuration of this family , which is consistent with the fact that the solution of the equation of motion is also a solution of the valley equations . for details , see the numerical result in ref .",
    "it turns out that the quantum fluctuation around the bounce solution along this family of the valley configurations actually corresponds the negative mode .",
    "therefore , we can separate the integration along the negative mode with the aid of the valley method and thus do not suffer from the problem of fake instability .",
    "there are two distinct @xmath26-(@xmath27-)valley configurations since the curvature at the central potential bottom ( at @xmath2 ) is different , even at the leading order of @xmath28 , from the one at the side potential bottoms ( at @xmath3 ) ; the @xmath26-(@xmath27-)valley which satisfy @xmath29 @xmath30 are different from the ones which satisfy @xmath31 or @xmath32 @xmath30 .",
    "the euclidean action of the former with large separation @xmath16 can be calculated by the perturbative expansion in @xmath33 as follows : @xmath34 while the one of the latter with large separation @xmath35 can be calculated in the same way as , @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the euclidean action of one ( anti-)instanton eq .",

    "( [ eqn : sibi1c ] ) and ( [ eqn : sibi2c ] ) , the fourth term can be interpreted as the interaction term between the valley - instanton and the anti - valley - instanton .",
    "therefore , the minus sign indicates that the interaction is attractive .",
    "the other type of the solutions emerges in this case , which is asymptotically composed of two successive valley - instantons or two successive anti - valley - instantons .",
    "we call them @xmath39-valley and @xmath40-valley , respectively . these configurations do not appear in the case of double - well potentials since they connect every other vacuum",
    ". the euclidean action of them with large separation @xmath16 can be also calculated in the same way as , @xmath41 note that the sign of the fourth term is plus and thus the interaction between the ( anti-)valley - instantons in this case is repulsive .",
    "it turns out that these interaction terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : sibi1c])([eqn : siicu ] ) play an important role in circumventing the breakdown of the dilute - gas approximation and in producing physically acceptable results .",
    "utilizing the knowledge of the ( anti-)valley - instantons and the interactions between them obtained previously , we can evaluate the partition function @xmath42 by summing over those configurations made of several ( anti-)valley - instantons .",
    "the sum of the contributions from the @xmath43 valley - instantons configuration can be written as , @xmath44}{n\\choose 2n_{ii}}{\\mathcal{j}}_{n , n_{ii } } , \\label{eqn : zcu1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 denotes the contribution of the jacobian and the @xmath16-independent part of the determinant for one valley - instanton - pair and is calculated as @xmath46 .",

    "from eqs .  ( [ eqn : zcu1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : dfnjcu ] ) , the nonperturbative contributions to the spectra are determined by the following equation : @xmath55 we will solve the above equation by the series expansion in @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 stands for the spectra corresponding to , in the limit @xmath59 , the eigenfunctions of the center potential well and @xmath60 for the ones corresponding to the parity eigenstates obtained by the linear combinations of the eigenfunctions of the each side potential well .",
    "the results are complicated because the calculation needs separate treatments depending on the value of the parameter @xmath61 . for details , see eqs .",
