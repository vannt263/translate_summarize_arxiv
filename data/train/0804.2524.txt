    "the study of microscopic structure and dynamics of traveling wave solutions in multi - species one - dimensional stochastic systems has attracted people s attention in this field considerably in recent years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for instance , the microscopic dynamics of shocks are studied for three families of single - species one - dimensional reaction - diffusion systems with open boundaries and nearest - neighbors interactions which include the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ( pasep ) , the branching - coalescing random walk ( bcrw ) and the asymmetric kawasaki - glauber process ( akgp ) @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in all three systems the time evolution of a product shock measure with a single shock front is equivalent to that of a simple random walker on a finite lattice with homogeneous hopping rates in the bulk and special reflection rates at the boundaries , provided that some constraints on the microscopic reaction rates are fulfilled .",
    "the steady - states of these three systems can be essentially written as a linear superposition of such product shock measures .",
    "on the other hand , the steady - states of these systems can be obtained using the matrix - product formulation @xcite in which the steady - state weights are written in terms of the product of non - commuting operators which satisfy a quadratic algebra ( for a recent review of this approach see @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly , it has been found that the conditions under which these operators have two - dimensional matrix representations are exactly those for a product shock measure to have a simple random walk dynamics in these systems @xcite .",
    "+ it has been shown in @xcite that the existence of a two - dimensional representation for the quadratic algebra of a multi - species one - dimensional reaction - diffusion system with open boundaries and nearest - neighbors interactions implies that the steady - state of the system can be written in terms of a linear superposition of product shock measures .",
    "it seems that the same is true for the systems whose quadratic algebras have higher - dimensional matrix representations .",
    "for instance , for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundaries it is known that the quadratic algebra has an infinite - dimensional matrix representation .",
    "it has been shown that this is associated with the fact that the steady - state of this system can be written as a linear superposition of product shock measures with infinite number of shocks @xcite .",
    "+ the microscopic dynamics of shock fronts has also been studied in driven - diffusive systems with more than a single species of particles and also in these systems with next - nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite-@xcite . + despite of these efforts it is still generally unclear whether the existence of a finite - dimensional matrix representation of the quadratic algebra is related to the fact that the steady - state can be expressed as a superposition of product shock measures . in this paper",
    "we consider a generalized one - dimensional single - species coagulation - decoagulation model with reflecting boundaries as a new example .",
    "we believe that the study of this exactly solvable model provides us with another piece of evidence for the existence of such relation and definitely sheds more light on the unknown aspects of this problem .",
    "we will show that a product shock measure with two shock fronts which have simple random walk dynamics can evolve in this system provided that the microscopic reaction rates satisfy some constraints .",
    "this will enable us to construct the steady - state of the system simply by considering a linear superposition of such measures ; however , we will not follow this approach here .",
    "instead we will show that under the _ same constraints _ the quadratic algebra of this model has a four - dimensional representation .",
    "+ our paper is organized as follows : in section ( 2 ) we will explain the mathematical preliminaries and introduce the model . in section ( 3 ) we will study the dynamics of a product shock measure with two shock fronts and investigate the conditions ( by imposing some constraints on the microscopic reaction rates of the model ) under which it has a simple time evolution similar to that of two random walkers moving on a one - dimensional lattice while reflecting from the boundaries",
    ". the fourth section will be devoted to the investigation of whether a finite - dimensional representation exists for the quadratic algebra of the model under the same conditions . in the last section we will discuss the summery of results .",
    "we define @xmath0 as the probability vector of a markovian interacting particle system at the time @xmath1 .",
    "the time evolution of this vector is governed by the master equation which can be written as a schrdinger equation in imaginary time as follows : @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is an stochastic hamiltonian .",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are the transition rates between different configurations . for a single - species system with nearest - neighbors interactions defined on a one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath4 with reflecting boundaries",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath3 is of the following form : @xmath5 in which : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a @xmath8 identity matrix and @xmath9 is a @xmath10 matrix for the bulk interactions . in the basis",
    "@xmath11 the hamiltonian @xmath9 can be written as : @xmath12 in which we have defined the basis vectors : @xmath13 associated with the presence of a particle and a hole in each lattice site respectively . requiring the conservation of probability ,",
    "the sum of the elements in each column should be zero ; therefore , one has @xmath14 for @xmath15 . + in our generalized coagulation - decoagulation model the non - zero reaction rates belong to the following reactions : @xmath16 in which @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for the presence of a particle and a hole in each lattice site respectively .",
    "this model has already been studied in related literatures in a couple of special cases . for instance consider the case : @xmath19 the complete spectrum of the hamiltonian in this case",
    "has been obtained exactly @xcite .",
    "the steady - state of the system has also been studied using both the method of empty intervals @xcite and the matrix - product approach @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the phase diagram of the model in this case has two different phases : a low - density phase and a high - density phase which are separated by a coexistence line .",
    "the particle concentration on the lattice in both phases have exponential behaviors with three different length scales while on the coexistence line it changes linearly in the bulk of the lattice and grows exponentially near one of the boundaries .",
    "by using the matrix product approach it has been shown that for the special tuning of the parameters given in ( [ r2 ] ) the quadratic algebra of the model has a finite - dimensional matrix representation @xcite .",
    "since the system has three different length scales and that these length scales are determined by the eigenvalues of these matrices @xcite , the authors in @xcite have found that the minimum dimensionality of these matrices should be four .",
    "+ the most general case ( [ r1 ] ) has already been studied on a finite lattice with open boundaries in which the particles can enter into the system or leave it from the boundaries @xcite and also on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "note that the microscopic reaction rates in our generalized model are exactly those of the bcrw studied in @xcite . as we mentioned before",
    ", it is known that traveling wave solutions exist for the bcrw with open boundaries under some constraints on the microscopic reaction rates . in @xcite",
    "the author has shown that in the open boundaries case the steady - state can be written as a matrix - product state with two - dimensional matrix representation given that the same constraints are satisfied .",
    "the authors in @xcite have studied the dynamical phase transition in this system when considered on an infinite lattice .",
    "in what follows we consider the most general reaction rates ( [ r1 ] ) and study the time evolution of a product shock measure with two shock fronts defined as : @xmath20 on a lattice of length @xmath4 with reflecting boundaries .",
    "we define two auxiliary sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 for convenience . in figure 1",
    "a simple sketch of a double - shock structure is given .",
    "we investigate the conditions under which the time evolution equations for ( [ p ] ) are simply those of two random walkers at sites @xmath23 and @xmath24 moving on a finite lattice .",
    "it turns out that by imposing two constraints on the microscopic reaction rates one finds the appropriate answer .",
    "these constraints are found to be : @xmath25 provided that the height of the shocks is : @xmath26 one should note that these constraints are exactly those obtained in @xcite for the model with periodic boundary conditions .     and @xmath24.,height=113 ]    under these constraints",
    "the time evolution equations for @xmath27 take the following form : @xmath28 in which the bulk hopping rates for the shock fronts ( random walkers ) are : @xmath29 and also the reflection rate from the boundaries is found to be : @xmath30 note that the original model has six independent parameters while by imposing the constraints ( [ con ] ) only four independent parameters are remained .",
    "+ the last equation in ( [ te ] ) implies that an empty lattice is a trivial steady - state of the model .",
    "it should be mentioned that the random walkers repel each other so that their positions can not get closer than a single lattice site .",
    "this has already been observed in @xcite for the special choice of parameters given in ( [ r2 ] ) . for the present case , as in @xcite",
    ", one can simply define a new measure @xmath31 as : @xmath32 and investigate its dynamics to see that the shock positions never meet each other at two consecutive sites .",
    "the reason for this goes back to the fact that the dynamical rules ( [ r1 ] ) do not allow an empty system to be generated from a system with particles .",
    "in fact the system has two different steady - states .",
    "the trivial steady - state , as we mentioned above , is the one without any particles .",
    "the other one , which is a nontrivial steady - state , contains some particles .",
    "if we start with an empty lattice , it always remains empty .",
    "in contrast , if we start with a partially - filled lattice , it will reach to an steady - state which contains particles .",
    "it can be shown that the nontrivial steady - state of the system can be written as a linear superposition of @xmath27 s .",
    "this will be discussed and presented elsewhere . in the next section",
    "we are going to calculate the steady - state of the system using the matrix - product approach .",
    "the question is that whether or not a finite - dimensional matrix representation exists for the quadratic algebra of this model under the constraints ( [ con ] ) .",
    "according to the matrix product formalism the stationary probability distribution @xmath33 of any configuration @xmath34 is assumed to be of the form : @xmath35 in which the occupation number @xmath36 is defined as follows : @xmath37 if the site @xmath38 is empty and @xmath39 if it is occupied by a particle .",

    "one should note that the model has a mirror symmetry which means that it is invariant under the following transformations : @xmath71 defining two new variables @xmath72 and @xmath73 , it can be shown using ( [ ref ] ) that the case ( @xmath74 ) never happens because @xmath75 then has to be negative .     and @xmath76 . the four regions i - iv are defined in the text .",
