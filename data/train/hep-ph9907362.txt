    "the possibility that nature may reveal the presence of extra spacetime dimensions at distance scales as large as an inverse tev  @xcite has fueled considerable interest in extra - dimensional embeddings of the standard model  @xcite . in the minimal approach , chiral matter fields are confined to three spatial dimensions , or a three - brane , while the gauge and one or both higgs fields are allowed to propagate in the higher , @xmath3 dimensional bulk spacetime , where @xmath4 dimensions are compactified on an orbifold of radius @xmath5 .",
    "this picture has many desirable features , including the possibility of understanding the breaking of supersymmetry at low energies ( as well as the origin of the @xmath6 parameter ) via the scherk - schwartz mechanism  @xcite , and the potential of achieving an accelerated gauge unification  @xcite .",
    "bounds on the scale of compactification have been determined in effective four - dimensional theories through the effects of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations on precisely measured low - energy electroweak observables , and found to be typically of order a few tev  @xcite .",
    "hence , the possibility exists that kk excitations of the standard model gauge fields might be produced and studied at a range of future colliders experiments  @xcite .    within this framework",
    ", it is possible to construct models in which matter that is chiral under the standard model gauge group also propagates in the higher dimensional bulk .",
    "this can be arranged if chiral conjugate mirror fields are introduced so that kk mass terms can be formed . in the @xmath7 orbifold models of interest to us in this paper ,",
    "these mirror fields are taken to be @xmath7 odd , so that they have no effect on the spectrum of light states .",
    "one interesting feature of these models is that a coupling between any number of bulk fields respects a conservation of kk number .",
    "for example , a coupling between three @xmath7 even fields @xmath8 , with @xmath9 in the case of one extra dimension @xmath10 , leads to a coupling between the different modes @xmath11 that vanishes if , for example , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "clearly , models with chiral matter in the bulk will exhibit a different pattern of couplings between ordinary ` zero - mode ' particles and the kk excitations of the gauge fields .",
    "this suggests that bounds from precision electroweak measurements will be affected and therefore merit a reexamination in this context .",
    "which extended models should we consider ?",
    "while there are admittedly a large number of possibilities , we will focus on three cases that are plausible from the point of view of simplicity , and that also have potentially interesting low - energy phenomenologies .",
    "the first model , the ` bulk lepton ' scenario @xcite , is somewhat similar in spirit to the ` ununified ' standard model @xcite , though unification is in fact one of its strong points . in the ununified standard model , quarks and leptons",
    "are distinguished at short distance scales by having completely independent electroweak gauge groups . in the bulk lepton scenario ,",
    "quarks and leptons are distinguished at short distance scales by the fact that only leptons can propagate into the higher dimensional space . as we point out in section  [ sec : two ] , this model leads to an improvement in accelerated gauge unification , and thus presents a plausible alternative to the minimal approach . the second case that we consider , the ` bulk generations ' scenario , has similarities in spirit to topcolor  @xcite or topflavor models  @xcite . in these models",
    ", the third generation is distinguished from the first two at short distance scales by having its own independent set of standard - model - like gauge factors . in the bulk generations scenario , the third generation is distinguished at short distances by the fact that it is the only generation that can not propagate into the bulk .",
    "we will describe later why this selection of bulk generations is preferred for tev - scale compactifications . in both the bulk lepton and bulk generations scenarios ,",
    "the kk excitations of the standard model gauge fields can not couple to leptons of the light generations , so one might suspect that the form of the corrections to electroweak observables would be significantly affected .",
    "the third case that we consider is one in which the su(2 ) gauge multiplet is confined to the three - brane , while the others are not . as far as the electroweak sector of this model is concerned , one might make the comparison to four - dimensional models in which a @xmath0 boson is obtained by minimally extending the standard model gauge group by a u(1 ) factor . in the ` su(2)-brane '",
    "scenario , a @xmath0 boson is obtained by minimally extending the electroweak gauge group into extra dimensions , allowing only hypercharge to propagate in the bulk .",
    "one might regard the lightest kk state as as a minimal extra - dimensional @xmath0 , @xmath14 , that could be placed among many others ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc . ) that have been studied in the literature .",
    "we consider the electroweak bounds on each of these scenarios in sections  [ sec : two ] , [ sec : three ] , and [ sec : four ] , respectively . in the final section",
    "we summarize our conclusions .    before proceeding to the analysis , however , it is important to point out that we will determine bounds on the compactification scale , @xmath19 , only in the five dimensional version of each of the models described above . with only one additional spatial dimension ,",
    "sums over intermediate kk states are convergent , and results can be obtained without ambiguity . for more extra dimensions ,",
    "the sums over kk states diverge if the gauge couplings are naively assumed to be independent of kk number . in reality",
    ", one expects that there is a suppression of the couplings to higher kk modes , and that this effect physically regulates the sums  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the couplings on kk number , @xmath20 , follows from string theory considerations , and is model dependent .",
    "thus , we will relegate a quantitative treatment of the @xmath21 models to a time when this dependence is more reliably known .",
    "the possibility that we consider in this section is scenario  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite : the standard model gauge multiplets as well as leptons of all three generations live in the higher dimensional bulk , while the quarks and both higgs fields are confined to the three - brane .",
    "this choice leads to a marked improvement in gauge unification compared to the minimal scenarios discussed extensively in the literature .",
    "in addition , this `` bulk lepton scenario '' predicts that the kk excitations of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bosons will be leptophobic , as a consequence of the conservation of kk number .",
    "the fact that this scenario is a viable alternative to the minimal one , and may yield relatively exotic collider signatures ( such as a leptophobic @xmath24 with otherwise standard model couplings ) is motivation for considering the indirect constraints on the model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the choice of placing both higgs fields on the three - brane implies that the @xmath6 parameter is not generated through compactification as , for example , in ref .",
    ". however , there may be other natural ways of obtaining a @xmath6 parameter of the desired magnitude .",
    "we comment on this issue at the end of this section .",
    "the essential phenomenological features of this model can be appreciated by considering first a five - dimensional u(1 ) gauge theory , spontaneously broken by two higgs fields both confined to a three - brane .",
    "the relevant four - dimensional lagrangian is given by @xmath25 + g^2(v_1 ^ 2+v_2 ^ 2)(a_\\mu^{(0)}+\\sqrt{2}\\sum_{n=1}a_\\mu^{(n)})^2\\]]@xmath26 where @xmath27 represents any quark field , and the @xmath28 are higgs",
    "vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "the fact that both higgs fields are stuck on a brane leads to the mixing term between the zero - mode gauge field and its kk excitations .",
    "the gauge boson mass matrix takes the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "working to lowest order in @xmath31 , it is straightforward to show that this matrix is diagonalized by the rotation @xmath32 and that the lowest eigenvalue is given by @xmath33 unlike the case in which one higgs field lives in the bulk  @xcite , here there is no dependence on the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "the rotation in eq .  ( [ eq : rmat ] ) leads to a shift in the coupling of the zero - mode gauge field to zero - mode brane fermions ( in this case the quarks and higgs ) @xmath34 but no change in the coupling to zero - mode bulk fermions ( the leptons ) @xmath35 the generalization of these results to an su(2)@xmath36u(1 ) gauge theory is straightforward : one breaks electroweak symmetry in the five dimensional theory and rotates from the weak to mass eigenstate basis before integrating over @xmath37 .",
    "then one obtains mass matrices for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bosons that are of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : massmat ] ) , with @xmath38 , respectively . with these results in hand",
    ", we may now consider the corrections to electroweak observables .",
    "we will denote the su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . for clarity",
    ", we will express our analytic results in terms of sums over kk modes . to obtain numerical results",
    ", we will use @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "let us begin with the fermi constant .",
    "the kk excitations of the @xmath22 do not contribute to muon decay at order @xmath43 .",
    "however , @xmath44 is still affected by the shift of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 mass eigenvalues . given the standard model relation , @xmath45 we find @xmath46 \\,\\,\\ , .",

    "atomic parity violation yields an even weaker bound .",
    "the relevant four - fermion operator @xmath68 has the same dependence on @xmath44 and on the physical gauge boson masses as in the standard model , but an additional factor of @xmath69 arising from the shift in the @xmath23 boson coupling to quarks .",
    "thus , the weak charge is proportional to @xmath70 , or using eq .",

    "is the additional shift in @xmath23-quark coupling by the factor given in eq .",

    "finally , we comment on the origin of the @xmath6 parameter in this model . since both higgs fields live on the three - brane , the @xmath6 parameter does not arise through compactification , but is simply present as an allowed term in the lagrangian .",
    "thus it seems at first glance that the @xmath6 problem is no better than in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "however , if the fundamental cutoff of the theory @xmath82 ( the string scale ) coincides with the unification point , then we find @xmath83  tev for @xmath84  tev , assuming the beta functions given in ref .",
    "@xcite . to obtain a @xmath6 parameter below one tev ,",
    "we therefore would like @xmath85 .",
    "such a suppression seems completely natural from the point of view of horizontal flavor symmetries .",
    "for example , in any flavor model in which the third generation fields are trivial singlets , and in which the ratio of higgs vevs is of order unity , one might obtain the desired ratio between bottom and top mass by assuming an additional approximate global symmetry under which only the down - type higgs doublet transforms nontrivially . given the breaking of this symmetry in the quark yukawa interactions , one would then estimate that the @xmath6 parameter is of order @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the bottom quark yukawa coupling .",
    "this is precisely of the desired magnitude .",
    "there are presumably many ways in which a modest suppression factor such as this one can be obtained , so we will content ourselves with the observation that the @xmath6 problem seems less than problematic in this model given the greatly reduced ultraviolet cutoff of the theory .",
    "the possibility of complete generations living in the bulk was suggested in the work of dienes , dudas and gherghetta  @xcite as a plausible variation on the minimal scenario .",
    "here we will consider the bounds on a model in which the first two generations live in the bulk , together with the gauge multiplets and one of the two mssm higgs fields .",
    "this choice is preferred for a number of reasons .",
    "first , we note that if only one of the first two generations lived in the bulk , then conservation of kk number would prevent the kk gauge bosons from coupling to zero - mode fields of that particular generation .",
    "the resulting violation of the glashow - iliopoulos - miani ( gim ) mechanism provides a much stronger constraint on the compactification scale , leading its decoupling from the weak scale or the scale of superparticle masses .",
    "let us perform some simple estimates .",
    "consider the upper two - by - two block of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix in wolfenstein parameterization @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "if we make a reasonable assumption that the yukawa matrices and the biunitary matrices that diagonalize them are hierarchical in form , then we may parameterize @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "now consider the interaction between kk gluons and quarks of the first two generations @xmath27 , assuming that the first generation lives in the bulk . in the gauge basis , the interaction vertex",
    "is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the gluon field , and @xmath94 is the su(3 ) gauge coupling .",
    "this leads to flavor - changing interactions in the mass eigenstate basis , including @xmath95\\ ] ] thus , we have at the very least the following two operators that contribute to @xmath96-@xmath97 and @xmath98-@xmath99 mixing @xmath100 \\,\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where we have evaluated @xmath41 for @xmath42 . using the vacuum insertion approximation , it is straightforward to compute bounds from the splitting of the neutral meson mass eigenstates .",
    "we find @xmath101 from @xmath96-@xmath97 and @xmath98-@xmath99 mixing , respectively .",
    "this implies an absolute lower bound of @xmath102  tev ( for @xmath103 ) which places the lowest kk mode well above the electroweak scale , and beyond the reach of any proposed collider experiment .    on the other hand ,",
    "the possibility that the third generation is distinguished by its bulk / brane assignment is far less constrained . the relevant term in the effective lagrangian , assuming ckm - like mixing angles is @xmath104 and yields a bound of @xmath105  tev , where @xmath106 is an operator coefficient .",
    "this bound can be evaded , however , if the third generation ckm angles originate only from rotations on the left - handed up quarks .",
    "notice that even the modest choice of @xmath107 renders the bound from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bbop ] ) weaker than the typical bounds we encountered in the previous section .",
    "other third generation flavor - changing processes may be interesting as signals for this type of model , but at present do not provide any meaningful constraints  @xcite .    the observations above hold true if either the third generation is in the bulk and the first two generations are on the three - brane , or vice versa .",
    "however , the first choice seems disfavored by the largeness of the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "the difficulty originates from the rescalings that one must perform to relate yukawa couplings in the @xmath3 dimensional theory to the yukawa couplings we know and love . for example , in the case where the higgs and the top quark both live in the bulk , then a yukawa coupling of the higher dimensional theory has mass dimension @xmath108 . by a naturalness argument",
    ", we might expect this dimensionful coupling to be of the same order as the cut off of the theory , so that @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the yukawa coupling , @xmath82 is the string scale , and @xmath111 is dimensionless and of order unity .",
    "however , when one derives the effective four dimensional lagrangian in terms of 4d fields with canonical mass dimension , one finds that @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "we find the same result for bulk higgs and brane fermions , while in the case of bulk fermions and brane higgs the exponent changes from @xmath114 to @xmath4 . in light of this result , an order one top quark yukawa coupling suggests that all of the associated fields live on the three - brane .",
    "this leads us to the scenario of interest , in which only the first two generations , gauge fields and down - type higgs live in the bulk .",
    "with all the gauge fields and one higgs in the bulk , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 mass eigenvalues , as well as the shift in their couplings to three - brane fermions are the same as those presented in ref .",

    "however , an interesting feature that these bounds share is that they vanish ( at least to the order we are working ) in the opposite limit , @xmath134 .",
    "this result is easy to understand qualitatively : since the first two generations live in the bulk , corrections to electroweak observables that arise from kk exchange diagrams ( which are independent of @xmath135 ) are suppressed .",
    "the remaining contributions arise from shifts in the gauge boson masses and couplings , and are all proportional to powers of @xmath135 since the gauge boson mixing depends on the magnitude of the brane higgs vev .",
    "how small then can we reasonably take @xmath135 ? in the mssm ,",
    "this issue is normally settled by consideration of the perturbativity of the top quark yukawa coupling , renormalized up to high energy scales . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the yukawa couplings in the minimal scenario are actually driven to weaker values above the compactification scale , and this observation should carry over to the top quark yukawa coupling in the model of interest here .",
    "however , even taking the top quark yukawa to be as large as @xmath136 at the weak scale , we can only bring the tightest bound from @xmath137 down to @xmath138  tev .",
    "conservation of kk number for the light generations implies that kk modes are primarily pair produced in this model , so direct production channels would remain out of the reach of the tevatron . a possible , albeit speculative , loophole is that @xmath135 could be reduced much further if the top quark mass were generated largely via other ( strong ) dynamics .",
    "this is interesting in that it has been suggested that models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking involving top condensation may have a natural origin in an extra dimensional framework  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the results described here would suggest that kk excitations could be brought down to sub - tev energy scales , without running afoul of precision electroweak constraints .",
    "in this section , we consider an even more unconventional possibility , that different factors of the electroweak gauge group have different bulk / brane assignments . in refs .  @xcite it was pointed out that assigning the su(2 ) gauge multiplet to the three - brane is consistent with gauge unification , at least from a bottom - up point of view , if the other gauge multiplets , the right - handed leptons , and one generation of right - handed up and down quarks are assigned to the bulk .",
    "however , it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that a unified boundary condition for the couplings at the high scale may not be expected generically if the gauge groups are differentiated in this way . here",
    "we will simply allow for the possibility of a unified boundary condition , and focus on low - energy phenomenology .",
    "as we suggested in the introduction , any model whose electroweak sector is extended by allowing only the hypercharge multiplet to propagate in the bulk , might be thought of as possessing a minimal extra - dimensional @xmath0 , the first kk mode of the hypercharge gauge boson . while we will assume the bulk / brane assignments of the matter fields stated in ref .",
    "@xcite and above , we will describe to what extent our results carry over to any model of this type .    if we assign su(2 ) to the three - brane",
    ", then we must do the same for all the su(2 ) doublet fields . with two three - brane higgs doublets",

    "the exception , however , is the bound from @xmath44 : in any variant of this model , the left - handed fields are again located on the three - brane , so that the form of @xmath44 as determined in muon decay remains unchanged .",

    "such mixing was also inherent to the su(2)-brane scenario , forcing @xmath171  tev , from consideration of the fermi constant . given the typical results of recent collider studies  @xcite , we conclude that both the bulk lepton and the su(2)-brane scenarios are outside the reach of the tevatron for direct production of kk states , but nonetheless could be discovered at the lhc .",
    "the bulk generation scenario is interesting in that the lowest order bounds weaken monotonically as @xmath135 is decreased , the same limit in which the brane higgs vev vanishes .",
    "since this is the higgs field that is responsible for giving the top quark its mass , we found that the requirement of perturbativity of the top quark yukawa coupling leads to bounds of the same order as those in the other two scenarios .",
    "however , we noted that in models where the top quark mass has an additional dynamical component ( which have been suggested in the extra dimensional context  @xcite ) that @xmath135 could be reduced and the electroweak bounds weakened , allowing the possibility of sub - tev kk excitations .",
    "finally , we point out that the extended models considered here have collider signatures that differ noticeably from the minimal scenario , ranging from leptophobic @xmath24 bosons in the bulk lepton scenario , to flavor - changing neutral current kk interactions involving third generation fields in the bulk generation scenario .",
