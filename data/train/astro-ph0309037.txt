    "modeling the ir radiation of pre - main - sequence stars has traditionally involved `` classic '' geometrically - thin optically - thick disks . this approach fails to produce many features of observed spectral energy distributions ( sed ) in both t tauri stars ( tts ) and herbig ae / be stars ( haebes ) .",
    "one way out of this problem is to supplement the disk emission with a surrounding optically thin halo ( e.g.  butner , natta & evans 1994 ; miroshnichenko et al 1999 , mive hereafter ) .",
    "a simpler alternative was proposed by chiang & goldreich ( 1997 , cg hereafter ) : the surface skin of any optically thick object is of course optically thin .",
    "the emission from the disk surface layer can become significant under certain flaring conditions , and cg present sed fits of a number of tts purely in terms of flared disks .",
    "this proposal was extended to sed modeling of haebes by chiang at al ( 2001 ) and natta et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "while the cg model successfully solves the sed problem with a simple physical explanation , recent high - resolution imaging observations of both tts and haebes reveal the presence of halos , ignored in the cg approach .",
    "most striking is the case of gm aur , a classical tts whose sed modeling was presented as evidence of the success of the cg approach ( chiang & goldreich 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , hst / nicmos images by schneider et al ( 2003 ) show a flared disk with radius of 300 au , but they also reveal the presence of a surrounding tenuous envelope extending to a radius of 1000 au . using detailed monte carlo calculations , schneider et al find that simplified models with flared disk without an imbedding halo fail to replicate the scattered light intensity pattern seen in the nicmos images .",
    "the addition of a halo is essential for successful modeling of both the sed and the images .",
    "similarly , hst and ground - based imaging by stapelfeldt et al ( 2003 ) of the tts hv tau c show a nearly edge - on flared disk imbedded in a more extended nebulosity . from detailed model calculations",
    "stapelfeldt et al find that although it is possible to fit the sed purely with a flared disk , the flaring is unreasonably large and such models do not reproduce the image adequately .",
    "they conclude that a flared disk alone is an inadequate model and that an additional , extended component to the circumstellar density distribution is needed to explain the observations .",
    "finally , from detailed modeling of flared disk sed kikuchi , nakamoto & ogochi ( 2002 ) conclude that halos are necessary supplements in explaining flat - spectrum tts .",
    "high resolution observations of haebes give similar evidence for imbedding halos . combining space- and ground - based observations of hd 100546 , the nearest herbig be star , grady et al ( 2001 )",
    "resolve the disk , which extends to 5(500 au ) from the star and displays the elongation of inclined viewing with @xmath4 = 49 .",
    "but they also find that the disk is imbedded in a more extended halo ( 10  radius ) that is roughly circular in shape and optically thin ( background stars are visible through it ) .",
    "polomski et al ( 2002 ) performed high - resolution ground - based observations of a sample of haebes whose mid - ir emission was claimed to be disk - dominated by hillenbrand et al ( 1992 ) .",
    "they find instead that the emission is not confined to an optically thick disk but originates in a more complex environment that includes large , extended dust envelopes . from analysis of iso data ,",
    "creech - eakman et al ( 2002 ) conclude that only a subset of the haebes they observe can be described purely in terms of the cg model ( notably , e.i .",
    "chiang is a coauthor of this study ) .    how can the sed of the same t - tauri star , gm aur , be fitted successfully with a flared disk both with a halo ( schneider et al 2003 ) and without one ( chiang & goldreich 1999 ) ?",
    "is it at all possible to distinguish between these two cases ?",
    "what , if any , is the unique radiative signature of each component",
    "? obviously , imbedding a disk in a tenuous halo with a very small optical depth is not going to affect its emission appreciably .",
    "at which stage then does the halo assume a significant role ?",
    "here we address these questions . in appendix",
    "a we derive general results for the emission from optically thin dust in an arbitrary geometry .",
    "we apply these results to the surface layers of flared disks in  2 and to halos in which the disks could be imbedded in  3 .",
    "chiang and goldreich ( 1997 ) noted that the emission from the optically thin surface layer of an optically thick disk , which has been neglected traditionally , can become significant under certain flaring conditions .",
    "the stellar radiation penetrates to an optical distance  = 1 along a direction slanted to the surface by angle @xmath5 ( figure [ fig : cg ] ) .",
    "the optical depth of the corresponding skin layer along the normal to the surface @xmath6 is @xmath5 at visual and @xmath7 at wavelength @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the dust cross - section at visual . in the case of a flat thin disk",
    "whose inner radius is determined by dust sublimation , the grazing angle is    here  is the radius of the star ,  is the dust sublimation radius ( eq.[eq : r1 ] ) and  is distance from the axis .",
    "flaring is defined by the radial profile of the disk height @xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) or , equivalently , as is evident from figure [ fig : cg ] , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , therefore the grazing angle of a flared disk is the cg surface layer serves as an effective optically thin disk atop the underlying optically thick disk core , and its flux is obtained from the volume integration listed in equation [ eq : flux ] . in the case of face - on orientation",
    ", the optical depth of the cg layer obeys @xmath14 , therefore its flux at distance @xmath15 is since the temperature profile of optically thin dust depends only on distance from the radiation source , the geometry dependence of this expression enters only from the radial variation of the grazing angle @xmath5 ( reflecting the dust column variation ) .",
    "but other geometries can produce an identical expression .",
    "for example , in the case of spherical geometry the flux is controlled by the dimensionless density profile @xmath16 ( equation [ eq : eta ] ) and the radial optical depth is @xmath17 .",
    "denoting the optical depth at visual wavelengths by , the flux is where @xmath18 . since @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "enter only as integration variables in the last two integrals , the two expressions are mathematically identical if a minor point is that @xmath21 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fcg ] is strictly a function of @xmath22 rather than @xmath20 ( since temperature is controlled by distance from the star ) ; this slight difference can be ignored because @xmath23 everywhere in the disk .",
    "scattering can be treated similarly and produces the same result since the only difference is that @xmath24 is replaced by @xmath25 , another function of @xmath19 ( see equation [ eq : scat ] ) .",
    "therefore , _ there is a complete equivalence between spherical halos and the cg surface layers of flared disks _ ; either case defines a model with the other geometry and the exact same flux .",
    "specifically , equations [ eq : flat ] and [ eq : equiv1 ] show that a thin flat disk is equivalent to a spherical halo with @xmath26 and  = @xmath27 . in the case of a flared disk , equations [ eq : alpha ] and [ eq : equiv1 ]",
    "show that the cg layer will produce precisely the same flux as a spherical halo with in particular , the equivalent halo of a disk with flaring angle @xmath28 has density distribution @xmath29 . and",
    "conversely  given a spherical halo , the flared disk with the same outer radius and will produce the exact same flux from its cg - surface layer .",
    "each disk defines a mathematically equivalent halo .",
    "although this equivalence was derived only for face - on viewing of the disk , it carries to most inclination angles since the flux from optically thin dust involves a volume integration ( equation [ eq : flux ] ) and the observed fraction of the disk surface layer remains largely intact as long as internal occultation is not too significant .",
    "similarly , the general analysis presented in appendix a shows that the spherical idealization is not essential for the halo geometry . the dust distribution can be flattened and even distorted into irregular shape before severely affecting the emerging flux .",
    "these results resolve the paradox of successful sed fits for the same star , gm aur , with a flared disk both with a halo ( schneider et al 2003 ) and without one ( chiang & goldreich 1999 ) . the halo contribution to the flux can be absorbed into the disk component by readjusting the flaring law , enabling a successful sed fit without a halo even though it is directly visible in imaging observations .",
    "the problems stapelfeldt et al ( 2003 ) report with disk - only models of hv tau c find a similar explanation .",
    "the halo contribution to the sed can be shifted to the disk , with the halo optical depth added to the flaring angle ( equation [ eq : equiv ] ) .",
    "this leads to unreasonably large flaring , as stapelfeldt et al find .",
    "the same problem was encountered by kikuchi et al ( 2002 ) in modeling flat - spectrum tts .",
    "the halo optical depth in these sources are sufficiently high that they can not be substituted by disks with realistic flaring .",
    "in addition to explaining the shortcomings of disk - only models in these specific cases , the equivalence between halos and cg layers has two important broad consequences :    1 .",
    "_ when the disk is imbedded in a halo that radiates more than its cg layer , the halo becomes the dominant component of the ir flux_. this happens when the halo contains more dust than the halo - equivalent of the disk . from equations [ eq : beta ] and [ eq :",
    "equiv ] , the ir radiation from the system is dominated by the halo contribution whenever where @xmath2 is the optical depth across the halo at visual wavelengths ( 2  for spherical halos ) .",
    "it is impossible to distinguish the cg layer of a flared disk from a halo with flux measurements_. only imaging can produce an unambiguous signature of the cg layer .",
    "the brightness contours of face - on flared disks are concentric circles centered on the star .",
    "inclined viewing changes the contours substantially .",
    "consider the intensity of radiation scattered from the cg surface layer .",
    "it obeys where @xmath30 is the distance to the star and @xmath31 the optical depth toward the observer at the scattering point ( equation [ eq : basic ] ) .",
    "both factors introduce distinct image asymmetries .",
    "the fundamental reason for image distortion by inclination is that the same projected distance from the star corresponds to widely different locations on the surface of the disk . on that surface ,",
    "contours of equal distance from the star are circles of radius .",
    "when viewed face - on from distance @xmath15 , each contour appears as a concentric circle of radius @xmath32 , as seen in the top image in figure [ fig : cgimage ] . at inclination viewing angle @xmath4 to the disk axis , the contour is no longer circular .",
    "absent flaring , the contour becomes an ellipse centered on the star with major axis 2  and minor axis @xmath33 , aligned with the projection of the disk axis on the plane of the sky .",
    "flaring raises the contour to height @xmath34 above the equatorial plane ( figure [ fig : cg ] ) , and the star is shifted toward the observer along the minor axis by @xmath35 .",
    "a point on the contour at position angle @xmath36 from the near side of the minor axis is observed at displacement @xmath37 from the star , where these contours are shown in the bottom image of figure [ fig : cgimage ] .",
    "the off - center position of the star on the minor axis creates an asymmetry such that the far and near portions of this axis obey @xmath38 .",
    "because @xmath39 increases with , this asymmetry increases with distance from the star .    at observed displacement @xmath40 from the star , a point on the surface of the disk",
    "is located at @xmath41 . at that point",
    "the optical depth of the cg layer toward the observer is @xmath42 , where therefore the scattering image obeys in this expression , both @xmath5 and @xmath43 are determined at the location @xmath44 on the disk surface .",
    "a power - law grazing angle @xmath45 produces the image @xmath46^{2 + p}/o(\\phi)$ ] . this expression and",
    "the resulting brightness contours explain the results of monte carlo scattering calculations for flared disks ( whitney & hartmann 1992 , wood et al 1998 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : asymmetry ] shows the scattering images at three viewing angles of a flared disk with the parameters suggested for ab aur by dullemond et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "the images produced at emission wavelengths are handled in complete analogy .",
    "the only change is the replacement of @xmath47 by the temperature @xmath21 , i.e. , another function of @xmath30 , modifying the dependence of brightness on @xmath48 .",
    "brightness contours not subject to rim occultation are ellipses with eccentricity @xmath49 that directly determines the inclination angle irrespective of the flaring profile .",
    "the images shown in figure [ fig : asymmetry ] possess an additional deviation from circular symmetry , unique to flaring and conveniently measured by the brightness at diametric locations across an axis through the star this asymmetry parameter vanishes for flat disks at all inclination angles , and for pole - on and edge - on viewing irrespective of the flaring .",
    "however , at intermediate inclination angles , flaring introduces substantial asymmetry , as is evident from figure [ fig : asymmetry ] .",
    "non - vanishing @xmath50 is the hallmark of inclined flared disks because it measures the displacement of the isophote centers from the peak brightness position .",
    "its systematic variation with azimuthal angle easily distinguishes it from deviations from the perfect geometry of idealized models or noise in the data .",
    "each flaring profile produces its own characteristic signature @xmath50 .",
    "for example , it is easy to show that the constant grazing angle @xmath5 used in figure [ fig : asymmetry ] gives @xmath51 along the minor axis .",
    "therefore , measuring @xmath50 determines the flaring profile once the inclination is determined from the eccentricity of the brightness contours .",
    "the results of the previous section show that flux calculations of a flared disk in vacuum can be considered a special case of the more general family of models in which the disk is imbedded in an optically thin halo . in the cg case",
    "the `` halo '' is the disk surface layer , fully determined from the flaring geometry .",
    "this layer provides the same ir emission and heating of the underlying optically thick core as its equivalent halo .",
    "therefore , a study of the general halo - imbedded - disk problem contains every possible cg model of flared disks while also covering all cases in which the disk is indeed imbedded in a dusty halo whose optical depth exceeds the bound in equation [ eq : equiv2 ] .",
    "consider a star surrounded by a geometrically thin passive disk and a dusty halo ( figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "we study the case of a flat disk and a spherical halo , simplifications that enable us to derive analytical results and broad conclusions that offer important insight .",
    "these simplifications do not cause any serious limitations . as noted previously ,",
    "the halo geometry can be distorted considerably without much impact on the outcome . and",
    "because only the optically thick core of the disk enters into considerations , its only relevant property is its temperature distribution , the surface shape is immaterial . indeed ,",
    "wolf et al ( 2003 ) present detailed model calculation of a flared disk imbedded in an envelope pinched around the equatorial plane , and their results fully conform to our conclusions .",
    "the halo extends from the inner radius  to some outer radius @xmath52 .",
    "thanks to scaling , instead of these radii we can specify the dust temperature on each boundary ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the halo is fully characterized by its density profile @xmath53 ( eq .  [ eq : eta ] ) and optical depth ; only @xmath54 is relevant in tts and haebes since the star is always visible .",
    "because of its potentially large optical depth , the disk can extend inside the dust - free cavity where its optical depth comes from the gaseous component .",
    "the geometrically - thin disk assumption implies that the disk temperature varies only with radius , vertical temperature structure is ignored .",
    "this temperature is calculated from radiative flux conservation through the gaussian surface in the shape of a small pillbox shown in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "denote by the radiative flux entering the pillbox from above , including both the stellar and diffuse components .",
    "then where @xmath55 is the 3rd exponential integral , @xmath56 is the disk vertical optical depth and @xmath57 is the cosine of the angle from the disk normal .",
    "the first two term on the left are the disk contribution to the upward flux , the third is the contribution of local intensity transmitted upward through the disk . when the disk is optically thick at frequencies around the peak of @xmath24 ( @xmath58 for @xmath59 ) , the second and third terms can be neglected , leading to the standard expression for disk temperature ( e.g.  friedjung 1985 , kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) .",
    "we assume this to be the case everywhere in the disk , an assumption that we check for self - consistency in all our model calculations .",
    "with its temperature derived , the disk emission is calculated from @xmath60 $ ] . because the disk is optically thick around the planckian peak at all radii",
    ", the self - absorption factor can be neglected in the calculation of the disk overall bolometric flux .",
    "then @xmath61 , the disk flux observed at distance @xmath15 and inclination @xmath4 , is proportional to @xmath62 , reflecting the variation of projected area .",
    "this proportionality remains largely unaffected by the envelope attenuation because the short wavelengths , the main contributors to the bolometric flux , emanate from close to the star so that their pathlength is approximately isotropic .",
    "denote by  the disk contribution to the overall luminosity @xmath63 and by  the contribution of the ( halo + attenuated stellar ) spherical component .",
    "the corresponding flux components are then and the overall flux is @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "the standard `` bare '' disk has @xmath66 ( kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) , therefore in this case @xmath67 .",
    "larger fractions can occur when the disk is imbedded in a halo because of the heating effect of the diffuse radiation , discussed below .",
    "we performed detailed model calculations with the code dusty ( ivezi , nenkova & elitzur 1999 ) which takes into account the energy exchange between the star , halo and disk , including dust scattering , absorption and emission . because its optical depth is typically @xmath68 ,",
    "the halo is transparent to the disk emission in all the models we consider and we neglect the disk effect on the halo . in all the calculations ,",
    "the spectral shapes @xmath69 of the grain absorption and scattering coefficients are those of standard interstellar mix , the sublimation temperature  = 1500  k. the spectral shape of the stellar radiation is taken from the appropriate kurucz ( 1994 ) model atmosphere .",
    "the heating rate of a thin flat disk by the stellar radiation at @xmath70 is where  is the stellar flux at  and @xmath71 , with  distance from the axis ( friedjung 1985 ) .",
    "this result reflects the @xmath72 decline of the stellar solid angle and the @xmath73 variation of the grazing angle , yielding disk temperature variation @xmath74 .",
    "natta ( 1993 ) noted that imbedding the disk in a dusty halo can significantly affect its temperature even at small halo optical depths ( see also dalessio , calvet & hartmann 1997 for the effect of optically thick halos ) . with a simple model for scattering at a single wavelength she found that the disk temperature law becomes @xmath75 if the halo density profile is @xmath76 .",
    "our calculations confirm this important point .",
    "figure [ fig : t ] shows the temperature profile for a disk around a  = 10,000 k star when `` bare '' and when imbedded in a spherical halo with @xmath77 and  = 0.1 and 1 shows that our calculated profile for = 1 dips slightly below that of the bare disk at @xmath78 .",
    "this happens because we neglect the disk emission in the calculation of the halo temperature .",
    "the error introduced by this approximation is of order 2% when = 1 , and even less at smaller . ] .",
    "even though a halo with  as small as 0.1 is almost transparent to the stellar radiation , it still causes a large rise in disk temperature .",
    "as is evident from the bottom panel , the halo contribution to the disk heating overtakes the stellar contribution inside the dust - free cavity and dominates completely once the dust is entered .",
    "wolf et al ( 2003 ) present a similar figure for their model .",
    "a dusty envelope with  = 0.1 intercepts only about 10% of the stellar luminosity while the disk intercepts 25% of that luminosity .",
    "so how can the halo dominate the disk heating ?",
    "the reason is that direct heating of the disk by the star occurs predominantly at small radii .",
    "the disk absorbs more than 90% of its full stellar allotment within @xmath79 while its entire remaining area , even though so much larger , absorbs only @xmath80 . from equation [ eq : r1 ] ,",
    "the halo starts at @xmath81 , where @xmath82 has already declined to   of its value at the stellar surface .",
    "in contrast , the halo emission is isotropic , therefore half of the radiation it intercepts is re - radiated toward the disk , greatly exceeding the direct stellar contribution .",
    "further insight can be gained from the approximate solution presented in ivezi & elitzur ( 1997 ; ie hereafter ) for radiative transfer in spherical symmetry . from equations 20 and b4 of ie",
    "it follows that disk heating by a halo with @xmath68 and @xmath76 is roughly when @xmath83 ; when @xmath84 the factor @xmath85 is replaced by @xmath86 .",
    "this yields @xmath87 , corroborating natta s result and extending its validity beyond the single - wavelength scattering approximation she employed .",
    "the temperature profile is similar to that of a bare disk when @xmath88 but more moderate when @xmath89 . more importantly , and since  100",
    ", the halo dominates the heating at @xmath90 for  as small as 0.02 when @xmath91 . as  increases , the halo dominance of the heating moves inside the cavity",
    "there the halo heating remains approximately constant while the stellar heating varies as @xmath92 , therefore stellar heating dominates only at @xmath93 , at larger distances the halo takes over .",
    "this explains the results presented in the lower panel of figure [ fig : t ] as well as figure 9 in wolf et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "the figure also shows the temperature profile of the halo .",
    "this profile is largely independent of , varying roughly as @xmath94 when the long - wavelength spectral shape of the dust absorption coefficient is @xmath95 .",
    "the important property evident in the figure is that the disk is much cooler than the envelope at all radii at which both exist and can also contain cooler material in spite of being much smaller , with far reaching consequences for the system radiation .      from equation [ eq : fluxes ] ,",
    "the fractional contribution of the disk to the overall bolometric flux is face - on orientation gives the maximal @xmath96 and the standard `` bare '' disk , with @xmath67 , has @xmath97 .",
    "introduce the normalized sed @xmath98 , with similar , separate definitions for the disk and spherical components of the flux .",
    "then since the disk flux obeys @xmath99 for the range of parameters considered here , @xmath100 is independent of the viewing angle @xmath4 , and the entire @xmath4-dependence of the sed comes from the mixing factor @xmath101 .",
    "figure [ fig : seds ] shows sample seds for some representative models .",
    "the halos extend from  to 1,000 , with density profiles and overall optical depths as indicated .",
    "the behavior of seds for spherical shells was discussed in ie and since the halo emission is unaffected by the imbedded disk , the seds plotted in dashed lines need no further discussion . the disk , on the other hand , is strongly affected by the halo as is evident from contrasting each disk sed , plotted in long - dashed line , with what it would have been in the absence of a halo ( dot - dashed line ) . the two curves are identical within the first bump around 1 , caused by the stellar heating . in the absence of a halo , the disk sed drops from that peak as @xmath102 . however , halo heating of the outer regions of the disk generates the second broad bump of disk radiation , which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than the `` bare '' disk emission .",
    "the halo heating effect is also evident from other disk properties .",
    "the disks in these models start at the stellar surface and extend to a radius  where the temperature is  = 25 k. in the absence of a halo , this temperature would be reached at  = /  = 18 .",
    "as table 1 shows , heating by even a tenuous halo with  = 0.1 pushes this radius out by almost factor 5 for the steep density profile @xmath47 and another factor of 2 for the flatter @xmath103 profile which spreads the heating further away from the star .",
    "the impact of halo heating increases with , pushing  further out still .",
    "similarly , the disk luminosity , @xmath104 , is only @xmath105 in the absence of a halo but increases as the halo directs more radiation toward it to the point that it becomes @xmath106 when  = 1 .",
    ".derived parameters for the models whose seds are presented in figure [ fig : seds ] .",
    "the luminosity ratio of the components is @xmath65 and the disk radius is  = , set from the requirement  = 25 k. a `` bare '' disk (  = 0 ) has @xmath67 and  = 18 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     although it is more compact , the disk can become the stronger emitter at long wavelengths so that the overall sed is dominated by the halo at ir wavelengths and by the disk at sub - mm and mm wavelengths .",
    "this role reversal affects also the wavelength behavior of images .",
    "figure [ fig : images ] shows a series of images at various wavelengths for a sample model . at ir wavelengths",
    "the image is dominated by the halo , displaying the size variation discussed in appendix a. the 0.6  image is dominated by scattering ,",
    "the @xmath107 5images reflect dust emission , leading to size increase with wavelength .",
    "the disk emerges at 17  and dominates the @xmath107 100  images .",
    "the finite beam size and dynamic range of any given telescope could result in an apparent size decrease between 10  and 100  in this case .",
    "such an effect has indeed been discovered in the haebes mwc 137 , whose observed size decreases between 50  and 100  ( difrancesco et al 1994 , 1998 ) .",
    "a switch from envelope to disk domination provides a simple explanation for this puzzling behavior .",
    "no single dust configuration can explain such a decrease , a conclusion reached already in mive and further affirmed by the results of appendix a. difrancesco et al ( 1998 ) suggest that this behavior might reflect multiple , rather than singular , sources of heating but the results of appendix a show the inadequacy of this conjecture .",
    "the region heated by any single source displays an increase of observed size with wavelength , and the superposition of multiple heating sources preserves this behavior .",
    "the opposite trend is possible only when the density distribution contains two distinct components , one optically thick , cool and compact , the other optically thin , warmer and more extended .",
    "a similar effect was detected also in the dust - shrouded main - sequence star vega .",
    "van der bliek , prusti & waters ( 1994 ) find that its 60  size is @xmath108 , yet 850  imaging by holland et al .",
    "( 1998 ) produced a size of only @xmath109 .",
    "so the dust distribution around vega , too , could contain both spherical and disk components with the switch from halo- to disk - dominance occurring somewhere between 60 and 850 .",
    "indeed , imaging at 1.3 mm by willner et al ( 2002 ) reveal the presence of the disk .",
    "the calculation of the disk emission contains two free parameters , involving the temperature and optical depth at the disk edge .",
    "the disk outer radius determines its lowest temperature  and a corresponding planck - peak wavelength .",
    "while shorter wavelengths are emitted from a range of disk radii , all longer wavelengths originate from the edge of the disk .",
    "the resulting effect can be seen in figure [ fig : td ] , which shows two representative values of . by the model assumptions",
    "the disk must be optically thick at the local planck - peak wavelength everywhere ,  350  at  = 25 k. as long as the disk edge remains optically thick also at longer wavelengths , the emission follows the rayleigh - jeans profile @xmath110 .",
    "once the disk edge becomes optically thin , the sed switches to the steeper decline @xmath111 at longer wavelengths .",
    "the break in the disk sed is controlled by the optical depth of the disk edge , which we specify at 350 .",
    "figure [ fig : td ] shows also the effects of varying @xmath112 from its smallest value @xmath113 to a value sufficiently large that the edge is optically thick at all the displayed wavelengths .",
    "the bottom panel of each model in figure [ fig : seds ] shows the variation of the overall sed with viewing angle @xmath4 .",
    "the entire variation comes from the mixing factor @xmath101 ( see equations [ eq : rho ] and [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "since the parameters @xmath114 and @xmath4 enter only in the product @xmath115 but not separately , the sed is subject to a degeneracy : systems viewed at different inclination angles will have the same sed if they have the same @xmath115 in addition to all other properties . because of the rapid decline with distance of the radiation absorbed from the star ( cf eq .",
    "[ eq : hstar ] ) , the disk luminosity , i.e. , @xmath114 , has a steep dependence on its inner radius ; moving the disk inner edge from  to only 2  removes 56% of the stellar luminosity intercepted by the disk , 3  results in a 72% removal .",
    "_ such central holes reduce @xmath114 but do not impact any other relevant property _ because they remove only the hottest disk material whose contribution to the overall flux is negligible in comparison with the stellar component .",
    "figure [ fig : inclinations ] plots contours in the @xmath4  plane of constant mixing factor @xmath101 .",
    "it shows , for example , that the seds presented in figure [ fig : seds ] for @xmath4 = 70  would be the same for systems viewed at @xmath4 = 35  if the disk inner radius is increased from 1  to 2.2  in the  = 0.1 case and 6  for  = 1 .",
    "although the sizes of these holes can not be determined from sed modeling of single stars , from statistical arguments mive conclude that their existence is essential to produce a plausible distribution of inclination angles .",
    "thanks to the cg layer  halo equivalence , each model presented here describes also a disk with no halo and with the flaring angle defined by eq.[eq : beta2 ] from @xmath16 and .",
    "in particular , the sed presented for @xmath116 halos describe also flared disks without halo and with @xmath117 , those with @xmath118 cover flared disks with constant grazing angle @xmath5 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the equivalence strictly holds only for disks and halos of the same size .",
    "however , the models presented would be little affected if each halo was truncated at  because that would only remove halo emission at long wavelengths where the sed is dominated by the disk anyhow .",
    "since the flaring angle of each equivalent disk reaches 2  at its outer edge , halos whose optical depths require excessive flaring can not be realized with disks only .",
    "this was the problem recognized by stapelfeldt et al ( 2003 ) and kikuchi et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "the equivalence holds only for the sed .",
    "high - resolution observations would produce widely different images for each halo and its equivalent flared disk , except when the latter is viewed face - on .",
    "the results of  [ sec : cg ] show that every disk imbedded in a halo with @xmath120 can be replaced by a flared disk without a halo and with an identical flux .",
    "this mathematical degeneracy explains the success of sed modeling with disk alone a system like gm aur ( chiang & goldreich 1999 ) even though the halo was subsequently discovered in imaging observations ( schneider et al 2003 )",
    ". it also explains why such modeling runs into difficulties and requires excessive flaring when the halos have larger , as is the case in hv tau c ( stapelfeldt et al 2003 ) and flat - spectrum tts in general ( kikuchi et al 2002 ) .    disks generally do not exist in pure vacuum .",
    "equation [ eq : equiv2 ] defines the circumstances under which the surrounding dust becomes the dominant component of the ir flux . even at smaller ,",
    "when not dominating the overall flux , the halo can still dominate the disk heating and make a strong impact on its temperature profile (  [ sec : temp ] ) .",
    "ignoring the surrounding material can produce misleading results regarding the disk properties , such as its flaring profile .    in spite of the attractiveness of the flared disk as a simple , physical model without any additional components ,",
    "imaging observations give irrefutable evidence for the existence of extended halos in pre main - sequence stars .",
    "the origin of these halos has not been studied yet .",
    "stapelfeldt et al ( 2003 ) suggest that a replenishment process , either continued infall from the surrounding ism or a dusty outflow from the source itself , is operating .",
    "it is noteworthy in this regard that accretion with the small rates of   yr@xmath121 has been deduced from uv spectra of both haebes ( grady et al .",
    "1996 ) and tts ( valenti , basri & johns 1993 ; gullbring et al 1998 ; lamzin , stempels & piskunov 2001 ) , and is consistent with halos that have  0.1 ( mive ) .",
    "these low rates can not correspond to the main accretion buildup of the star but rather a much later phase , involving small , residual accretion from the environment .",
    "the corresponding accretion luminosities are only 0.1 , justifying their neglect in our calculations .",
    "in addition to the cg layer  halo equivalence , our results reveal numerous degeneracies that underscore the severe limitations of attempts to determine the dust morphology from sed analysis without imaging observations .",
    "the sed of a halo - imbedded - disk remains the same when the viewing angle and the size of the disk central hole vary together as shown in figure [ fig : inclinations ] . from the results of appendix",
    "a , the sed of a spherical shell with power - law density profile @xmath122 displays a dependence on @xmath123 only when @xmath124 , and then only in the spectral region @xmath125 .",
    "all other regions of @xmath123 and @xmath126 produce the same universal behavior @xmath127 (  [ sec : spherical ] ) .",
    "the dust optical properties introduce additional degeneracies .",
    "the results of  [ sec : spherical ] show that the frequency dependence of @xmath128 and the radial dependence of the density profile can be interchanged on occasion without affecting the sed .",
    "the fundamental reason for all these degeneracies is that the flux from an optically thin source involves a volume integration ( eq .  [ eq : flux ] ) that tends to remove much of the dependence on the underlying morphology .",
    "although the specific degeneracies we uncovered involve spherical geometry , the general analysis in appendix a shows that the spherical idealization is not essential . the dust distribution can be flattened and even distorted into irregular shape before severely affecting the results .",
    "these degeneracies make it impossible to determine the geometry from a fit to the sed alone without additional input .",
    "only imaging can trace the actual density distribution , and scattering provides a more faithful presentation because , unlike emission which involves also the dust temperature , it involves only the density distribution .",
    "reliance on sed modeling alone can produce misleading results , as was the case for the parameters of the flared disk in gm aur .",
