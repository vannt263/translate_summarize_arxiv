    "generally , entanglement states show a quantum - mechanically complicated behavior . a new method to analyze quantum entanglement using thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) @xcite has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the capacity has been confirmed in ref .  @xcite . in this new treatment of quantum entanglement with tfd , an extended density matrix has been defined on the double hilbert space ( ordinary and tilde hilbert spaces ) , and examined for some simple cases  @xcite .",
    "the new tfd - based method allows the entanglement states to be easily understood , because the intrinsic elements caused by quantum entanglement can be extracted from the extended density matrix in this formulation .",
    "consequently , it has been found that the intrinsic quantum entanglement can be distinguished from the thermal fluctuations included in the definition of the ordinary entanglement at finite temperatures .",
    "based on the analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been argued that the general tfd formulation of the extended density matrix is applicable not only to equilibrium states but also to non - equilibrium states .",
    "furthermore , the extended entanglement entropy has been introduced using the extended density matrix , and compared with the traditional entanglement entropy for the case of non - equilibrium spin system without external field  @xcite .",
    "however , analysis of the entanglement entropies of non - equilibrium systems with external fields has not been conducted in refs .",
    "@xcite and , therefore , the examination of the entanglement entropies of non - equilibrium systems with external fields using tfd is of current interest . in the present communication , therefore , the extended density matrices and the entanglement entropies of finite - spin systems with and without the non - competitive external fields are exhaustively investigated in both the equilibrium and non - equilibrium cases , based upon the general tfd algorithm .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the extended density matrix in the double hilbert space of the tfd , and review the equilibrium systems with external fields . in sec . 3",
    ", we obtain the the extended density matrices and the the extended entanglement entropies of non - equilibrium spin systems with and without the non - competitive external fields , and discuss the numerical results of the time dependence .",
    "finally , conclusions are described in sec .",
    "first of all , we give a short introduction of the extended density matrix , @xmath0 , in the double hilbert space of the tfd .",
    "@xmath0 has been defined in ref . @xcite as follows : @xmath1 using the ordinary density matrix , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the orthogonal complete set in the original hilbert space and @xmath4 is the same set in the tilde hilbert space of the tfd @xcite .",
    "if entanglement subsystems a and b are being examined , each of @xmath5 and @xmath6 states are represented as the direct products @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . moreover ,",
    "it has been proven in ref .",

    "the numerical results of these matrix elements at @xmath43 and @xmath44 have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the breaking of the spin inversion symmetry caused by the external field , @xmath45 , has been argued , i.e. @xmath46 at @xmath45 , and @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "the parameter , @xmath49 , in eq .   expresses the quantum entanglement effect .",
    "this quantum fluctuation is essential to quantum systems , and it has been used as an order parameter of 2d quantum systems @xcite . as can be seen from eq .",
    ", only the intrinsic quantum entanglement is extracted clearly in the tfd formulation . in particular , it can be understood that the entangled state of the system emerges through a single product , such as @xmath50 , in @xmath51 .",
