    "the gcr transport in the heliosphere is described by a fokker - planck equation , the so - called parker equation [ @xcite]:@xmath5 & & + \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\partial v_{sw_i}}{\\partial x_i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\varrho t u ) -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}(v_{d_i } u ) \\label{eq_parker}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the cosmic ray number density per unit interval of particle kinetic energy , @xmath7 is the time , @xmath8 is the kinetic energy ( per nucleon ) , @xmath9 the sw velocity along the axis @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the drift velocity related to the antisymmetric part of diffusion tensor [ @xcite ] , @xmath12 is the symmetric part of the diffusion tensor and @xmath13=@xmath14 [ @xcite ] , where @xmath15 is particle s rest energy .",
    "this partial differential equation is equivalent [ @xcite ] to a set of ordinary sdes that can be integrated with monte carlo ( mc ) techniques .",
    "the integration time step ( @xmath16 ) , is taken to be proportional to @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the distance from the sun ) avoiding oversampling in the outer heliopshere and therefore saving cpu time [ @xcite ] .",
    "we considered the 2d ( radius and colatitude ) approximation of eq .",

    "the drift velocity is split in regular drift ( radial drift @xmath24 , latitudinal drift @xmath25 ) and neutral sheet drift ( @xmath26 ) as described by @xcite .",
    "the radial diffusion coefficient is @xmath27=@xmath28+@xmath29 [ @xcite ] , where @xmath30 is the angle between radial versor and direction of the solar magnetic field described below .",
    "the latitudinal coefficient is @xmath31=@xmath32 [ e.g. , see  @xcite ] .",
    "we note as the perpendicular diffusion coefficient has two components , one in the radial direction ( @xmath33 ) and one in the polar direction ( @xmath34 ) as shown in @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath35 as the ratio between perpendicular and parallel diffusion coefficients , therefore @xmath36=@xmath37 .",
    "we fixed this value : @xmath38=0.05 while @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 close to the poles and @xmath41 in the equatorial region)[@xcite ] , to reproduce the correct magnitude and rigidity dependence of the latitudinal cosmic ray proton and electron gradients [ cf .",
    "the parallel diffusion coefficient is @xmath42=@xmath43 [ @xcite ] ; here @xmath44 au@xmath45gv@xmath46s@xmath46 , is a diffusion parameter depending on the solar actvitiy ( see section  [ par ] ) , @xmath47 is the particle velocity , @xmath48 is the cr particle s rigidity , @xmath49=@xmath48 , @xmath50 is the value of heliospheric magnetic field at the earth orbit , and @xmath51 is the magnitude of the heliospheric magnetic field ( hmf ) [ @xcite ] : @xmath52 \\label{bpark}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is a coefficient that determines the field polarity and allows @xmath54 to be equal to @xmath55 ,  i.e. , the value of imf at the earth orbit ; @xmath56 is the polar angle determining the position of the heliospheric current sheet ( hcs )  [ @xcite ] ; @xmath57 is the _ heaviside _ function , thus @xmath58 $ ] for the change of sign between the two regions - above and below the hcs - of the heliosphere ; finally @xmath59 , with @xmath30 the spiral angle .",
    "the parker field has been modified introducing a small latitudinal component @xmath60=@xmath61 with @xmath62 , thus allowing one to obtain @xmath63 and a field magnitude according to @xcite : @xmath64 that increases the magnitude of the hmf in the polar regions without a modification of the field topology .",
    "this component produces a lower magnetic drift velocity in this region , with the effect of a lower cr penetration along polar field lines in the inner part of the heliosphere [ @xcite ] .",
    "we use a sw broad smoothed profile according to ulysses data for periods of low solar activity [ @xcite ] , described by the relation @xmath65 if @xmath66 or @xmath67 and @xmath68 if @xmath69 where @xmath70 is approximately 400 km / s and @xmath71 is 760 km / s .",
    "drift effects are included through analytical effective drift velocities : in the parker spiral field we evaluated drift due to gradient , curvature and neutral sheet that modify the integration path inside the heliosphere .",
    "we adopted the approach of potgieter and moraal [ @xcite ] , because it is able to reproduce the effects of drift in both quiet and active solar periods [ a discussion on other models can be found in @xcite ] . in this model",
    "the drift coefficient is modified with a transition function that simulates the effect of a wavy neutral sheet .",
    "the sharpness of this function is related to @xmath3 angle , expanding or shrinking the region of influence of neutral sheet drift . as lis , both for protons and antiprotons ,",
    "we use the ones used in @xcite and obtained from galprop .",
    "values versus monthly ssn . the linear fit is also shown .",
    "reported values cover the time period 1951 - 2004.,width=313 ]    values of the tilt angle @xmath3 are computed using two different models , described in @xcite , fitting separately periods of increasing solar activity and periods of decreasing solar activity [ @xcite ] .",
    "the three drift components do not depend on external parameters , except the solar polarity , so a@xmath720 for positive periods and a@xmath730 for negative periods [ @xcite ] .",
    "we selected cr @xmath74 and @xmath75 data from several experiments in order to compare and tune model results .",
    "we modulated separately @xmath74 and @xmath75 lis spectra and then we computed the ratio . in this paper",
    "we show experimental data taken during periods of low solar activity : the comparison with bess-97 ( a@xmath720 july 1997 , see @xcite ) and pamela ( a@xmath730 from 2007 to 2008 , see @xcite ) . @xmath2 and @xmath76 values for these periods",
    "were obtained from nssdc omniweb system by 27 daily averages , while tilt angle values from the wilcox solar laboratory [ @xcite ] .",
    "we estimated the values of @xmath4 , needed to evaluate the cr modulation in different conditions , from the modulation parameter reported in @xcite .",
    "we searched a relation between the estimated @xmath4 values and the monthly smoothed sunspot numbers ( ssn ) .",
    "we found that there is a nearly linear relation between @xmath4 and ssn values ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_sim1b ] ) , with a gaussian distribution of the best fit with a rms of 19% .",
    "this is a first crude estimation , we will perform a more complex anaysis , e.g. fitting separately different solar phases , in order to avoid systematics in the relation and to reduce the rms . in this way we can use the estimated ssn values to obtain the diffusion coefficient @xmath4 . following this approach we introduced in our code a gaussian random variation of @xmath4 with a rms of 19% .",
    "results of the simulation with and without the gaussian variation are consistent inside the indetermination of the code ( around 5% ) .",
    "our code simulates a diffusive propagation of a cr entering the heliosphere from its outer limit , that we located at 100 au ( note that in @xcite the termination shock is located at 94 au ) , and reaching the earth at 1 au ; the effects of heliosheath and termination shock are not taken into account in the present model .",
    "we evaluated the time @xmath77 needed by the sw to expand from the outer corona up to 100 au , with a minimum speed of @xmath78400 km / s it takes nearly 14 months , while the time interval @xmath79 of the stochastic evolution of a quasi particle inside the heliosphere from 100 au down to 1 au is between 1 month ( at 200mev ) and few days ( at 10 gev ) .",
    "this scenario , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 1 month , indicates that we should use different parameters ( monthly averages ) to describe the conditions of heliosphere in the modulation process .",
    "in fact at 100 au , where particles are injected , the conditions of the solar activity are similar to those present at the earth @xmath8214 months before .",
    "therefore , we can divide the heliosphere in 14 regions as a function of the radius . for each region we evaluated @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath83 , in relation to the time spent by the solar wind to reach this region .",
    "we indicate the present treatment accounting for the time evolution of the solar parameters as a _ dynamic _ approach of the heliosphere .",
    "results obtained with our propagation code are shown in .",
    "simulated fluxes obtained using parameters dependent on the heliospheric region agree with measured data within the experimental error bars .",
    "this happens both in periods with a@xmath720 ( bess-97 ) , and in periods with a@xmath730 ( pamela ) .",
    "this means that current treatment of the heliosphere improves the understanding of the complex processes occurring inside the solar cavity .",
    "ratio at 1 au and experimental data : bess ( 1997).,width=8 ]     ratio at 1 au and experimental data : pamela ( 2007 - 2008).,width=313 ]     ratio at 1 au for ams-02.,width=313 ]    our code can be also used to predict cr fluxes for future measurements .",
    "the assumption is that diffusion coefficient , tilt angle and solar wind speed show a near - regular and almost periodic trend .",
    "the periodicity is two consecutive 11-years solar cycles .",
    "we selected periods with a similar solar activity conditions and same solar field polarity of the time of interest : therefore approximately 22 years before .",
    "we used the values measured in that periods as an estimation of the conditions of the heliosphere .",
    "simulations have been carried out in prevision of the ams-02 mission that will be installed on the iss in 2011 : we choose january 2012 . for this period",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_sim3 ] the predictions of gcr modulation for the @xmath84 ratio . in order to reduce the uncertainty it is important to compare our model with the ams-02 data because of the huge statistics and the long time covered .",
    "we developed a 2d stochastic mc code for particles propagation across the heliosphere .",
    "we compared the ratios of @xmath84 fluxes measured by bess and pamela with those obtained from the present mc code . in the present calculations we used - for the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath83 - values corresponding to the periods of data taking .",
    "this description of the heliosphere and the forward approach seem to properly account for the propagation of gcr in the solar cavity .",
    "recent measurements [ @xcite ] have pointed out the needs to reach a high level of accuracy in the modulation of the fluxes , in relation to the charge sign of the particles and the solar field polarity",
