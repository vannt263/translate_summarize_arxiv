    "the understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres has advanced considerably in the last decade , thanks in part to the spectroscopic observations of transiting exoplanets . during a transit ,",
    "when a planet passes between earth and its host star , a small fraction of the starlight is blocked by the planet ; this can then be seen as a characteristic dip in the transit light curve . transiting planets offer a unique opportunity to study their atmospheres through a method called transmission spectroscopy . as the starlight passes through their upper atmospheres characteristic spectral signatures are superimposed on the light as it is absorbed or scattered .",
    "the absorption and optical depth of the atmosphere is dependant on wavelength , as is the altitude at which the planet is opaque to starlight .",
    "features observed in the transmission spectrum place strong constraints on the possible species in the atmosphere ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .    a range of atomic and molecular species have been identified in exoplanetary atmospheres through transmission spectroscopy , with a majority having been identified in the upper and lower atmospheres of hd 189733b and hd 209458b , which remain the most studied exoplanets to date .",
    "ground- and space - based observations ranging from the ultraviolet ( uv ) to the infrared ( ir ) have been able to probe both the lower and extended upper atmosphere of these two exoplanets ( for example : @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . + h@xmath8o is a key molecule for constraining hot - jupiter atmospheres .",
    "it is predicted that the c / o ratio plays a pivotal role in the relative abundances of h@xmath8o and the other spectroscopically important ch@xmath9 , co , co@xmath8 , c@xmath8h@xmath9 , and hcn molecules in the atmospheres of close - in giant planets ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have analysed transit and eclipse observations of a number of transiting hot jupiters , finding that some extrasolar giant planets could have unexpectedly low abundance of h@xmath8o due to high c / o ratios .",
    "atmospheres with solar elemental abundances in thermochemical equilibrium are expected to have abundant water vapour , and disequilibrium processes like photochemistry are not able to deplete water sufficiently in the infrared photosphere of these planets to explain the observations ( see @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "extinction from clouds and hazes could also significantly mask absorption signatures of water , however , this would also mask other molecular species making emission spectra appear more like a blackbody ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this paper we present the transmission spectrum of hat - p-1b based on one transit observation between 1.1@xmath0 m and 1.7@xmath0 m using hubble space telescope ( hst ) wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) in spatial scan mode . hst / wfc3 ir observations at 1.1 - 1.7@xmath0 m probe primarily the h@xmath8o absorption band at 1.4@xmath0 m .",
    "these observations are among the first results from a large survey with hst probing the transmission spectra , from the optical to near - ir , of eight hot - jupiter exoplanets ( go program 12473 , p.i .",

    "hat - p-1b is a low - density hot jupiter orbiting a single member of a visual stellar binary ( @xcite ) .",
    "hat - p-1b orbits its host star with a period of 4.5 days at a distance of 0.055au .",
    "it has a radius similar to that of hd209458b with a somewhat lower mean density with a mass of 0.54m@xmath10 .",
    "spitzer irac secondary eclipse measurements show that the atmosphere is best fit with a modest temperature inversion with a maximum dayside temperature of 1550k , assuming zero albedo , a uniform temperature over the dayside hemisphere , and no transport to the nightside ( @xcite ) .",
    "ks - band secondary - eclipse observations have also been conducted by the ground - based secondary eclipse ( grouse ) project with an estimated brightness temperature of 2136@xmath3150k and for an eclipse depth of 0.109@xmath30.025@xmath11 although there are still visible systematics that remain in the fit ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ in  2 we outline the observations and the use of spatial scan mode , in  3 we present the analysis of the extracted light curves , in  4 we compare the result with atmospheric models , and  5 we state our conclusions .",
    "observations of hat - p-1 were conducted in the nir with hst / wfc3 .",
    "wfc3 s ir channel consists of a 1024x1024 pixel teledyne hgcdte detector that can be paired with any of 15 filters or two low - resolution grisms ( @xcite ) .",
    "each exposure is compiled from multiple non - destructive reads ( nsamp ) at either the full array or a subarray .",
    "although the standard wfc3 configuration is not particularly efficient for high s / n time series data , as buffer dumps are long and the psf covers very few pixels ( low s / n per exposure ) , the instrumental systematics are noticeably lower than for nicmos as wfc3 does not suffer from strong intra - pixel sensitivities .",
    "wfc3 also has a factor of two improvement on sensitivity over nicmos with a much higher throughput and lower read - noise ( e.g. wfc3 instrument handbook ) .",
    "the observations started on july 5th , 2012 at 15:17 using the ir g141 grism in spatial scan mode over five hst orbits .",
    "we gathered exposures using 512 x 512 pixel subarrays with an nsamp=4 readout sequence and exposure times of 46.69 seconds .",
    "hat - p-1 is the dimmer member of a double g0/g0 star system , ads 16402 , separated by 11.2@xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "both stars are clearly resolved in the 68@xmath12 x 68@xmath12 field of view of hst / wfc3 s spatial - scan spectra and are easily extracted separately in the analysis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : imads9 ] and [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "this provides the opportunity to perform differential photometry on hat - p-1 using the companion s signal which can reduce observational systematics in the data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : white ] and [ fig : whitend ] ) .",
    "we present some of the first results from wfc3 using the spatial - scan mode to observe exoplanetary transits .",
    "the wfc3 spatial scanning involves nodding the telescope during an exposure to spread the light along the cross - dispersion axis , resulting in a higher number of photons by a factor of ten per exposure while considerably reducing overheads .",
    "this also increases the time of saturation of the brightest pixels , and allows for longer exposure times ( @xcite ) .",
    "our observations were conducted with a scan rate of 1.07 pixels per second , where 1 pixel = 0.13 arcseconds and thus spanning @xmath650 pixels over each 46.69 second exposure .",
    "the duty cycle of the observations improved from 26% in non - spatial - scan mode to 40% .",
    "+ the raw light curves of some wfc3 non - spatial - scan observations ( e.g. @xcite ) have been dominated by a systematic increase in intensity during each group of exposures obtained between buffer dumps referred to as the ` hook ' effect .",
    "it has been found that the ` hook ' is , on average , zero when the count rate is less than about 30,000 electrons per pixel ( @xcite ) .",
    "we observe a maximum raw count rate of 25,000 electrons per pixel in our target star and a rate of @xmath630,000 electrons per pixel for the companion star with no evidence for a significant ` hook ' effect in the reduced data of either star ( see fig . [",
    "fig : white ] ) .",
    "we used the  _ i m a _ \" outputs from wfc3 s _ calwf3 _ pipeline . for each exposure , _",
    "calwf3 _ conducts the following processes : bad pixel flagging , reference pixel subtraction , zero - read subtraction , dark current subtraction , non - linearity correction , flat - field correction , as well as gain and photometric calibration .",
    "the resultant images are in units of electrons per second .",
    "+ subsequent data analysis is conducted with the first orbit removed ( 26 exposures ) , as it suffers from thermal breathing systematic effects that require time to settle , all previous transit studies have used a similar strategy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this leaves 86 exposures over the remaining 4 orbits with a total of 30 in transit exposures .",
    "the mid - time of each exposure was converted into bjd@xmath13 for use in the transit light curves .",
    "+ we used a box around each spectral image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imads9 ] .",
    "the spectra were extracted using custom idl procedures , similar to iraf s apall procedure , using an aperture of @xmath323 pixels from the central row , determined by minimising the standard deviation across the aperture .",
    "this 47-pixel aperture is slightly shorter than the total height of the spectrum to utilise pixels having similar exposure levels to the maximum possible degree .",
    "the aperture is traced around a computed centring profile , which was found to be consistent in the y - axis within an error of 0.01 pixels .",
    "background subtraction was applied using the region to the left of the hat - p-1 spectrum ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : imads9 ] ) , because the region above and below each spectrum contains significant count levels which added noise to the resultant spectrum .      for wavelength calibration ,",
    "direct images were taken in the f139 m narrow band filter at the beginning of the observations for a reference of the absolute position ( x@xmath14 , y@xmath14 ) of the target star .",
    "we assumed that all pixels in the same column have the same effective wavelength , as the spatial scan varied in the @xmath15 by less than one pixel , giving a spectral range of 1.087 - 1.678@xmath0 m .",
    "this wavelength range was later restricted to 1.1173 - 1.6549@xmath0 m for the spectroscopic light curve fits as the strongly sloped edges covered by the grism response exhibit greater wavelength jitter where the intensities increase towards the edge of the bandpass ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) .    to calculate the wavelength corresponding to each pixel along the x - direction , we applied a linear fit to the wavelength solution .",
    "the wavelength solution is a function of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 position given by , @xmath17 and @xmath18 where , @xmath15 is taken from the filter image , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are taken from table 5 in @xcite , and @xmath21 is found in figure 6 of @xcite using the @xmath16 position from the filter image . + the g141 grism images contain both the 0th order , and the 1st order spectra for both stars .",
    "each 1st order spectrum spans 128 pixels with a dispersion of 4.65 nm / pixel and the separation between the two stellar spectra was 23 pixels in the y - axis and 33 pixels in the x - axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : imads9 ] ) .",
    "+ using the zeroth order spectrum , we characterised the shift in y@xmath14 over the course of the observations to monitor any shift in wavelength of the spectral trace .",
    "we observed a @xmath30.2-pixel column shift in the wavelength direction over the whole observing period .",
    "this corresponded to 0.00186@xmath0 m or a @xmath610% wavelength shift for each spectral bin over the span of the observations .",
    "we therefore adjusted the wavelength solution to use the average wavelength of the visit for each spectral bin .",
    "the observations , however , were relatively insensitive to sub - pixel wavelength shifts while the water spectral band spans a much larger wavelength range .",
    "+ larger wavelength shifts were observed by @xcite over the course of their observations of planetary transits which also revealed evidence of undersampling of the grism resolution by the pixel grid changing gradually and smoothly as a function of wavelength shift . to determine if our data contained similar undersampling , we compared a number of the spectral lines from the start and end of the observations ( separated by over 3 hours ) at a number of positions along the scanned spectra . unlike the results found by @xcite we see no flattening of the strong paschen - beta stellar line at 1.28@xmath0 m due to an undersampling effect .",
    "to help reduce the effects of any unidentified undersampling , we moderately binned our spectra effectively smoothing out any undersampling inherent in our data .",
    "to accurately model the transit light curves , stellar limb darkening has to be carefully considered .",
    "the light curves were fit using the @xcite limb - darkened analytic transit model .",
    "we calculated limb - darkening coefficients from a 3d time dependent hydrodynamical model ( @xcite ) over the wavelength range 1.1 - 1.7@xmath0 m with the coefficients calculated separately for each spectral band .",
    "we also computed the limb - darkening coefficients using kurucz stellar models for a star at t@xmath22=6000k , log g = 4.5 , and [ fe / h ] = + 0.1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the coefficients were calculated following @xcite using a non - linear limb - darkening law given by , @xmath23 where _",
    "i_(1 ) is the intensity at the centre of the stellar disk and @xmath24 is the angle between the line of sight and the emergent intensity .",
    "+ the 3d model shows overall weaker limb - darkening compared to the 1d model ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 3d model takes into account convective motions in the stellar atmosphere resulting in a shallower vertical temperature profile .",
    "as the strength of limb - darkening is closely related to the vertical atmospheric temperature gradient near the optical surface , the limb darkening slightly weakens for the shallower temperature profile .",
    "we find that this leads to an overall common shift in the derived planet - to - star radius ratio , with the shape of the transmission spectrum unaffected .",
    "we adopt the 3d model as it provides an overall better fit between our stis ( space telescope imaging spectrograph ) and wfc3 data ( @xcite ) .",
    ".table of constrained system parameters and errors ( from @xcite ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we therefore calculated the transmission spectrum using four different methods , testing the effects of individual parameter fitting and the cancelation of common - mode systematics using simple linear procedures , for both differential and single - target photometry .",
    "the four different methods displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : alltranspec ] show a common structure to the transmission spectrum , indicating the significance of the spectral feature despite the assorted analysis techniques regarding differential analysis and common mode removal of the systematic trends .",
    "we choose to quote final values for the transmission spectra from the analysis using differential photometry with individual parameter fitting , as it produces the highest quality light curve .",
    "the mean scatter of the residuals for all of the spectral bins is reduced by 10% from single to differential photometry .",
    "in addition a reduction of @xmath620% is seen between common - mode removal and individual parameter analysis .",
    "there is also a significant reduction in the red noise from @xmath25=1.4@xmath2610@xmath27 for differential photometry with common mode removal down to @xmath25=0.1@xmath2610@xmath27 for differential photometry with individual parameter analysis ( see table 3 ) .",
    "in addition , by conducting both differential photometry and individual parameter analysis , we are thus able to better budget for the affects of the dominant thermal - breathing systematic on the transit depths ( through the use of the covariance matrix ) and to better understand the specific wavelength dependant systematics inherent in the wfc3 data . while small , these can still potentially affect the resultant spectrum obtained .",
    "we have therefore adopted the method corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : alltranspec]a for further analysis and model fitting",
    ". we also perform analysis on the transmission spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : alltranspec]b discussed in sec .",
    "4.1.1 to corroborate the absorption significance of the water absorption feature . figure [ fig : speclc ] shows six of the 28 wavelength channels and their corresponding light curves fitted with differential photometry and individual parameter analysis ; the residuals demonstrate that this method efficiently corrects for the apparent common mode trend seen in the white light residuals in fig .",
    "[ fig : white ] .",
    "we compute the transmission spectrum for differential photometry over a number of systematic models from 4th order polynomial in hst orbital phase to a 7th order polynomial in hst orbital phase adopted for this analysis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orders ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : orders ] shows that systematic models fitting for hst orbital phase with a polynomial in the order between 4th and 7th do not change the overall transmission spectrum while the bic analysis favours a 7th order polynomial fit to the data . as we can not use the divide - oot routine , there are still some un - modelled systematics in the white light curve data resulting in a precision 2.9 times the photon limit . though we note that the absolute white light precision per exposure is @xmath62.3 times better than berta et al .",
    "with the use of optimised scheduling future observations can potentially take advantage of divide - oot with spatial scanning to increase the white light performance .",
    "our spectroscopic measurements come close to the photon noise limit of the detector with a mean error within 12% of the photon - limit and a precision of rp / r * less than 0.0009 per spectral channel similar to that shown by deming et al . ( 2013 ) and @xcite . +            finally , to further characterise systematic effects in the data that may not have been accounted for, we injected a transit of constant depth ( r@xmath1/r@xmath2=0.1142 ) into the reference star s light curve and computed the transmission spectrum over the same wavelength range with the same bin size . to compute the transmission spectrum , 7th order hst orbital phase corrections were applied and no common - mode systematic removal was conducted .",
    "the resultant transmission spectrum shows the wavelength variation in the flux of the reference star using the same exposures used to measure the planetary transit , and can be directly compared to the transmission spectrum of hat - p-1b computed using single target photometry and individual parameter ( i.e. with 7th order hst orbital phase correction and no common - mode systematic removal ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : inject ] ) . +",
    "as expected , the computed reference star ` transit spectrum ' is flat , with no water feature observed at 1.4@xmath0 m .",
    "this further demonstrates the reliability of the derived transit spectrum over the whole g141 spectral range .",
    "the transmission spectrum of hat - p-1b around 1.4@xmath0 m is presented in fig . [",
    "fig : spectrum ] .",
    "we compare the transmission spectrum to theoretical atmospheric models of hat - p-1b based on the models from @xcite and @xcite .    over the observed wavelength range sampled by the wfc3 g141 grism , the strongest atmospheric feature expected is water absorption band with a characteristic bandhead at 1.4@xmath0 m . in most lower atmosphere models of hot jupiters",
    "h@xmath8o is well mixed throughout the atmosphere , and most of the features between 0.7 and 2.5@xmath0 m come from the h@xmath8o vibration - rotation bands ( @xcite ) .",
    "these features are difficult to measure with ground - based telescopes due to confusion with water vapour signatures from the earth s atmosphere .",
    "space - based observations are therefore essential to probe such spectral regions in exoplanetary atmospheric studies .",
    "+ to help interpret the size of the spectral features seen in the transmission spectrum , we determine the scale height of the atmosphere that defines potential spectral features .",
    "the scale height ( h ) is the altitude range over which the atmospheric pressure decreases by a factor of _ e _ , @xmath28 where , @xmath29 is the boltzman constant , @xmath30 is the estimated atmospheric temperature , @xmath31 is the mass of hydrogen atom , @xmath32 is the mean molecular weight of the atmosphere , and @xmath33 is the surface gravity .",
    "the scale height of hat - p-1b is approximately 500 km for a h , he atmosphere at t = 1200k , which corresponds to transit depths of @xmath34 or 0.00062 r@xmath1/r@xmath2 .",
    "if water is to be observed in the nir transmission spectrum of hat - p-1b then the size of absorption features should be approximately two scale heights or more in size , which is well within the accuracy of these observations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) .",
    "we compared the derived transit spectrum of hat - p-1b to two different suites of theoretical atmospheric models for the transmission spectra , one set of models based on the formalism of @xcite and the other set based on the models by fortney et al .",
    "( 2008 ; 2010 ) .",
    "the pre - calculated models were compared to the data in a @xmath35 test , with the base planetary radius as the only free parameter to simply adjust the overall altitude normalisation of the model spectrum . as no interaction",
    "is made directly with the model parameters when making a comparison , such as fitting for the abundance of tio / vo , h@xmath8o , or t - p profile , the degrees of freedom for the @xmath35 test does not change between models .",

    "as hat - p-1 is also a member of a binary star system we were also able to use the resolved companion as a reference star to perform differential photometry , removing some systematics and reducing the errors of the observations . this allowed for increasing the resolution of the measurements without significantly increasing the errors .",

    "<S> we compute the transmission spectrum using both single target and differential photometry with similar results . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant transmission spectrum shows a significant absorption above the 5-@xmath7 level matching the 1.4@xmath0 m water absorption band . in solar composition models , </S>",
