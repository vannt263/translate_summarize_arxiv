    "the kepler mission @xcite will yield high - cadence photometric time series for many hundreds to a few thousands of oscillating solar - type stars . by using any method to extract periodic signals in these light curves , for example an fft or a least - squares fit to sinusoids , the _ pulsation frequencies _ or",
    "_ oscillation modes _",
    "@xmath0 will be detectable .",
    "the number of frequencies detected for each star will depend primarily on the intrinsic brightness of the star , its distance and the characteristics of its oscillation modes . consequently , the errors associated with each of the detected frequencies also depends on these characteristics . for data analysis purposes , however , we can quantify the error on each frequency @xmath1 as a function of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the power spectrum , the duration of observation @xmath2 and the natural linewidth of the frequency @xmath3 ( related to the damping rate of the oscillations ) .",
    "@xcite gives a formula for the estimation of these errors : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inverse of the snr and varies usually between 0.1 - 1.0 .      in order to determine the global parameters ( and subsequently the internal structure ) of a star , one needs to compare a set of _ model observables _ * b * to a set of _ observations _ * o*. we use a stellar structure and evolution code _ astec _ @xcite , coupled to an adiabatic oscillation code _ adipls _ @xcite .",
    "this model takes a set of input parameters * p * and generates a stellar model based on * p*. the expected observables * b * can be consequently calculated ( @xmath6 , magnitudes , mean density ... ) .",
    "one form of determining the stellar global parameters ( these are the * p * ) is to incorporate some algorithm that minimizes the discrepancies between the model observables and the observations , and then use a value ( such as @xmath7 ) to quantify the fit to the data : @xmath8 for each @xmath9 observation and @xmath10 represents the errors on each of the @xmath11 .",
    "once we find a robust fit to the data , we can use the following formula to calculate the uncertainties in each of the model parameters : @xmath12 for each @xmath13 model parameter . here ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the @xmath16 components of the singular value decomposition of the matrix * d * , whose elements @xmath17 are given by @xmath18 @xcite .    here",
    "we can see that the uncertainties in the parameters such as mass , radius and age come from the sensitivity of each of the observables with respect to each of the parameters ( from models ) , _ and _ the associated error on each of these measurements .",
    "these quantities can change by    * including more measurements , such as _ classical _ observations ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) or more oscillation frequencies * studying a star at various evolutionary stages , because the measurement sensitivities to each of the parameters changes as the stellar structure changes * varying the expected errors on the measurements @xmath22 .    in the first subsection we discussed the frequency errors and their dependencies on the photometric time series . here",
    "we translate these into uncertainties in the global parameters of radius and age as a function of quality of data and duration of observations .",
    "star as a function of _ signal quality_. each of the color curves represents the results for a specific duration of uninterrupted observations .",
    "the axis on the right shows the relative uncertainties .",
    "[ fig : poster1],scaledwidth=95.0% ]",
    "we show in figures [ fig : poster1 ] and [ fig : poster2 ] the expected uncertainties in the radius and the age , respectively , of a 1 m@xmath23 star as a function of _ signal quality_. we have quantified _ signal quality _ as ( snr , nf ) where the signal in snr refers to the amplitude of the highest peak in the spectrum , and the noise refers to the noise level around this peak .",
    "nf is the number of detected frequencies for each oscillation mode @xmath24 and 1 i.e. nf = 3 means 3 @xmath25 = 0 modes and 3 @xmath25 = 1 modes .",
    "if a star has a snr of 10 , then it is most likely that the number of detected frequencies ( nf ) in the power spectrum is higher than a star whose snr = 2 .",
    "for this reason we may assume that both the snr and nf increase together .",
    "these are the numbers on the x - axis in each graph : e.g. ( snr , nf ) = ( 2 , 3 ) , ( 4 , 5 ) etc .",
    "both figures also show the uncertainties in the radius and the age assuming various _ lengths of observation_. the various colour curves represent data of a specific time span of high - cadence 100% duty cycle observations : red , yellow , green and blue indicate respectively , 1 month , 3 months , 9 months and 12 months of observational data to extract the oscillation frequencies .",
    "* the stellar radius can be determined to within 2 - 3% for a 1 m@xmath23 star for all combinations of signal quality and observation length studied . * observing a star that has at least 5 detected frequencies for @xmath25=0 and @xmath25=1 modes yields @xmath2620% , where @xmath27 is the age , and requiring that the length of observation is at least 3 months , improves this to better than 12% . *",
    "the most significant improvements in @xmath28 and @xmath29 come from extending a data set from 1 month to 3 months . if the data set spans 9 months , then extending it will result in very little improvement in these quantities . *",
    "a star observed for 1 month requires a minumum ( snr , nf ) = ( 6 , 7 ) to constrain adequately the radius and the age of a 1 m@xmath23 ; 3 months requires a minimum ( snr , nf ) = ( 4 , 5 ) ; 9 months requires a minimum ( snr ,  nf )  =  ( 2 ,  3 ) .",
