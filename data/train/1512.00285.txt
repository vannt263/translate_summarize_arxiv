    "enceladus is a small ( 504 km in diameter ) and very bright ( visual geometric albedo of 1.4 ) satellite of saturn which presents extraordinary activity at its south pole , more precisely at the location of the long fractures known as the `` tiger stripes '' .",
    "plumes of water vapor and ice particles rising up to more than 200 km above the surface have been observed from the images taken by the cassini spacecraft .",
    "these observations , complemented by thermal measurements indicating an anomalously warm south pole region , have been interpreted as possible evidence of a liquid water reservoir beneath the surface ( porco et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "the nature of the reservoir ( global ocean or local reservoir ) is still debated .",
    "the surface from the interior and lead to a different rotation state .    using images of surface control points ,",
    "porco et al . (",
    "2006 ) detected no librations ( variations in the rotation rate ) .",
    "another component of the rotation is the spin precession , characterized by the . for a synchronous triaxial satellite",
    ", it is often assumed that the obliquity is that of the cassini state ( an equilibrium rotation state where the precession of the spin axis follows the precession of the orbit axis ) .",
    "when the orbital precession is uniform and the satellite is solid and rigid , the obliquity @xmath2 of the cassini state is constant and given , at first order in the small angles @xmath2 and @xmath3 , by ( e.g. noyelles 2010 , appendix b ) @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the constant orbital precession rate , @xmath3 is the orbital inclination ( constant if the precession is uniform ) , @xmath6 is the mean motion , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mass and the mean radius , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the second - degree gravity field coefficients , and @xmath11 is the polar moment of inertia",
    ".    from control points calculations using cassini s images , giese ( 2014 ) claimed that the obliquity of enceladus is limited to less than @xmath12 at the @xmath13 level .",
    "however , he has assumed the spin axis to be fixed in space during the observation period 2005 - 2012 , instead of being in the cassini state , .",
    "this is unlikely since the system is expected to be damped and without recent punctual excitation .",
    "the assumption of giese leads to determine the mean orientation of the orbit pole ( which is the laplace pole ) instead of the spin pole orientation , and its obliquity estimate is in fact an estimate of the mean orbital inclination .",
    "a theoretical published model for a solid and rigid enceladus in the cassini state demonstrated a two to three order of magnitude smaller upper limit of @xmath14 ( chen and nimmo , 2011 ) .",
    "the solution of chen and nimmo ( 2011 ) is equivalent to the solution given in eq .",
    "( [ solidrigid ] ) , from the measured gravity coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the estimate of the normalized mean moment of inertia @xmath17 of iess et al .",

    ", we propose a new theoretical model for the cassini state , taking into account that enceladus experiences a nonuniform orbital precession ( see bills , 2005 for an application to the galilean satellites ) , may harbor an internal global ocean ( see baland et al . , 2011 , for the first application of such a model to titan ) , and experiences periodic elastic deformations . to our knowledge , a theoretical model for the spin precession of a synchronous satellite under the influence of periodic tides does not exist yet , contrary to the case of the librations ( van hoolst et al .",
    ", 2013 ; richard et al . , 2014 ; jara - oru and vermeersen , 2014 ) .",
    "with this new model , we will assess the possibility of a resonant amplification of the solution ( due to the non uniformity of the orbital precession and/or the presence of the internal global ocean and/or the elastic deformations of the solid layers ) .",
    "such a resonance may lead to a high value of the obliquity , as already demonstrated theoretically for titan and the galilean satellites ( baland et al .",
    ", 2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "obliquity tides are often proposed as a possible cause for the geological activity of icy satellites .",
    "the need for a new cassini state model comes mainly from the hypothesis made by tyler ( 2009 , 2011 ) that the jets of enceladus could be associated with a strong heat flux resulting from tidal heating triggered by a high obliquity and the associated large scale flow in the ocean . according to tyler , to account for the observed flux , the obliquity of enceladus must have a minimal value of @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , nimmo and spencer ( 2015 ) argue that triton likely harbors an internal subsurface ocean and that the resurfacing of the satellite is due to convection driven by obliquity tides in the outer ice shell .",
    "rhoden et al .",
    "( 2015 ) linked the plume activity recently detected at europa s south pole to the stress variations induced by obliquity tides in an outer thin elastic ice shell mechanically decoupled from the interior by a subsurface ocean .",
    "in addition , the new cassini state model could benefit the study of the rotation of other synchronous satellites such as titan or ganymede .",
    "titan s obliquity has been measured ( stiles et al .",
    ", 2008 , 2010 ) and the tidal deformations may change the interpretation in terms of internal structure done in baland et al .",
    "the determination of the rotation state of ganymede is one of the goals of the future juice mission , and an accurate model for the obliquity will be needed to interpret future measurements .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2 , we extend the solid cassini state model to the case of an elastic satellite with periodic tidal deformations . which is equivalent to the solution given by eq .",
    "( [ solidrigid ] ) . in section 3",
    ", we consider the case where enceladus harbors a global internal ocean , and where gravitational and pressure torques arise between the solid layers .",
    "we compare the cases with and without elastic deformations to each other and to the respective entirely solid cases . in section 4 , we determine a new theoretical estimate of the upper limit for enceladus obliquity , and compare it to tyler s requirement .",
    "we also discuss the influence on the results of deviations of enceladus shape from the hydrostatic equilibrium and the implications of elasticity for the obliquity of other satellites such as titan .",
    "we present concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "we first consider that enceladus is entirely solid and rigid .",
    "the spin precession can be considered as a long - term behavior , compared to the orbital revolution .",
    "the angular momentum equation governing the spin precession , averaged over the short orbital / diurnal period , correct up to the first order in obliquity , eccentricity , and orbital inclination , is given by ( bills , 2005 , corrected for a sign error in baland et al . ,",

    "( [ rigidcase ] ) is the variation of the angular momentum @xmath28 while the right - hand member is the gravitational torque ( averaged over the orbital period ) exerted by saturn .",
    "the strength of the coupling , @xmath29 , depends on the moment of inertia difference @xmath30 .",
    "enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium , so this moment of inertia difference can be written as the sum of an hydrostatic part and of a non - hydrostatic one : @xmath31 the hydrostatic part results from the static deformations of enceladus under the influence of its own centrifugal potential and of the tidal potential raised by saturn , and can be written as @xmath32 with @xmath33 the fluid love number , @xmath34 the ratio of the centrifugal acceleration to the gravitational acceleration and @xmath35 the tidal parameter .",

    "chen and nimmo ( 2011 ) concluded that the time - varying obliquity would vary by 20% with respect to its small mean value .",
    "they used a secular variation model that includes the perturbations from the other satellites of saturn to generate a series for the orbital precession .",

    "baland et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2014 ) explained the measured obliquity by a resonant amplification of the solution for a titan with an internal ocean and rigid solid layers .",
    "however , the appropriate resonant amplification was met for only a very few density profiles among the whole range of density profiles considered .",
    "the preliminary results presented here indicate that more density profiles would meet the appropriate resonant amplification , which would influence the interpretation of the measured obliquity of titan in terms of internal structure of baland et al .",
    "we have developed a new model for the multi - frequency cassini state of a synchronous satellite which harbors an internal global ocean and deforms elastically .",
    "the model takes into account the external torque exerted by saturn on each layer of the satellite and the internal gravitational and pressure torques induced by the presence of the liquid layer .",
    "we applied the model to enceladus , which is known for its strong heat flux , possibly caused by obliquity tides , according to tyler ( 2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "we found that , for enceladus with a subsurface ocean , the surface has a maximal obliquity of @xmath61 degrees , taking into account the nonuniform precession of the orbit .",
    "this upper limit is smaller than the previous estimate by chen and nimmo ( 2011 ) and , unfortunately , than tyler s requirement ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "therefore , the strong heat flux of enceladus is more likely the result of another process , for example the eccentricity tides .",
    "the upper limit is also well below the achievable accuracy of cassini images .",
    "therefore , control point calculations will not have enough sensitivity to measure the obliquity of enceladus , let alone to constrain its interior from an obliquity measurement .",
    "although this study concludes with a negative result concerning enceladus , it opens interesting perspectives for other satellites like the galilean satellites and titan .",
    "larger satellites with larger tidal love numbers will be more affected than enceladus by the effect of elastic deformations .",
    "for instance , the rotation state of io can be strongly affected if its astenosphere is of low - viscosity , while the ocean of europa , ganymede , callisto , and titan would lead to large elastic deformations with a significant impact on the rotation state .",

    "we show in section [ computation ] that the shell / interior obliquity is smaller / larger than the .",
    "therefore , it is understandable that such an overestimation of the internal coupling strength would lead to bring the obliquity of the solid layers closer to each other , that is to say to overestimate / underestimate the shell / interior obliquity by about @xmath153 for enceladus .",

    "this demonstration consists in an extension of the computation presented in szeto and xu ( 1997 ) for the torque exerted by the external rigid ellipsoidal shell on the rigid interior .",
    "replacing equation ( 4 ) of szeto and xu ( 1997 ) , deformation from a sphere of any interface between two layers reads @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the mean radius of the interface and @xmath161 with the colatitude and longitude denoted by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",

    "since the periodic tidal bulges are an order , we can neglect the small misalignment between the different layers when computing the additional elastic torques .",
    "we also neglect the torques between the small radial bulges and the small librational and obliquity bulges , to keep only `` static - periodic '' torques .",
    "the periodic radial flattenings can therefore be neglected , and eq .",

    "( b13 ) of van hoolst et al . , 2013 ) and",
    "the y - component is implicated in the spin precession .",
    "the first part of the y component is for the torque of the static bulge of the shell on the periodic bulges of the interior ( first two lines in eq .",

    "now this torque has to be transformed into the inertial frame with the following rotations @xmath139 , and averaged over the orbital period , to give : @xmath199(c_{in}-a_{in } ) ( \\hat n \\wedge \\hat s_{sh}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effects of librational tides disappear during the averaging , only leaving the effect of the obliquity tides .    in the libration study ( van hoolst et al . ,",
    "2013 ) , the additional elastic torques were not due , at first order , to misalignment between layers .",
    "the librations angle of a layer @xmath200 appeared in the torques only because @xmath200 modulates the amplitudes of the librational bulge of layer @xmath175 .",
