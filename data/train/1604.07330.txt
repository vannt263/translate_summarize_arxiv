    "following the discovery of cosmic acceleration two decades ago , a flurry of theoretical work has culminated in what is now known as the @xmath3cdm model , or the concordance model . by introducing a cosmological constant term ( @xmath3 ) in addition to the presence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , it is able to broadly account for a large number of cosmological observations : galaxy power spectra , weak gravitational lensing , cluster counting , lyman - alpha forest , type ia supernova light - curves , and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy .",
    "the refinement of its six parameters is the subject of numerous present and future scientific experiments .",
    "the most recent data from the _ planck _ satellite shows broad consistency with the @xmath3cdm predictions @xcite .",
    "however , detailed analysis of the observed cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies reveals hints of deviations from these predictions : a temperature power spectrum deficit at large angular scales ( multipole @xmath4 ) and a lensing potential power spectrum excess at small angular scales  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , local measurements suggest a higher hubble constant @xmath5 and a lower amplitude of r.m.s .",
    "matter density fluctuations @xmath6 compared to those suggested by _ planck _  @xcite .    while the anomalies each only lie at the @xmath7 level and hence are not of great statistical significance , @xcite found them `` persistent . ''",
    "one possible explanation for this is that general relativity breaks down at cosmological scales , requiring modifications to the theory of gravity to account for the deviations observed .",
    "this hypothesis is attractive not only because it circumvents the need for post - hoc constructs such as the cosmological constant , but also because the discovery of a single model accounting for all of the anomalies would open up the possibility of `` new physics '' beyond the standard @xmath3cdm model .",
    "much ink has already been spent in pursuit of such `` modified gravity '' models , but the continuing absence of strong theoretical priors has left the search for a `` real '' theory of gravity largely fruitless .    in order to make sense of the plethora of models existing in the literature , it would be worthwhile to devise a common language to express them .",
    "this would facilitate the comparison of different models against one another , as well as provide a generic framework around which new models could be built . to this end , effective field theory ( eft ) has emerged as a prime contender in providing a unifying description of dark energy @xcite .",
    "linear perturbations upon a spatially flat friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) background can be described in the eft language using five functions dependent only on time : the dark energy equation of state @xmath2 , the effective planck mass run rate @xmath8 , the tensor speed excess @xmath9 , the kineticity @xmath10 , and the scalar  tensor braiding @xmath11  @xcite . in theories beyond horndeski gravity",
    ", a sixth function representing these deviations , @xmath12 , also appears @xcite .",
    "the full forms of the @xmath13 ( x = b , m , t , k ) functions can be found in table 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , while their physical interpretations are described in  2.1 of ref .  @xcite . in the @xmath3cdm model ,",
    "@xmath14 while @xmath15 .",
    "constraints on these parameters based on current cosmological data were calculated by ref .",
    "@xcite , while fisher matrices were calculated by ref .  @xcite . due to the highly degenerate nature of the eft parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath13 ) with other cosmological parameters , ref .",
    "@xcite completed their fisher matrix analysis by fixing all cosmological and nuisance parameters to their fiducial values . without marginalization , 68% confidence level ( cl ) errors",
    "were found to be on the order of @xmath16@xmath1 . in this paper",
    ", we extend their work by allowing all cosmological and nuisance parameters to vary and then marginalizing over them .",
    "for a set of parameters @xmath17 and a set of observables @xmath18 knowing the fisher matrix for @xmath19 allows one to write the fisher matrix for @xmath20 as @xmath21    in cosmology , the observables @xmath22 are the cmb multiples @xmath23 , the galaxy power spectrum in redshift space  @xcite , and the magnitude of type ia supernovae .",
    "the foreground - cleaned cmb power spectrum is modeled as @xmath24 where the beam window function is assumed to be gaussian , such that @xmath25 $ ] . the beam resolution is often specified by its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , which equals to @xmath26 . the noise is assumed to be gaussian and white .",
    "the overall scaling parameter @xmath27 accounts for the uncertainty of noise power estimation .",
    "we assume a @xmath28 level accuracy of noise estimation and use a gaussian prior @xmath29 .    for the cmb fisher matrix , we use _ planck _",
    "s 70  ghz , 100  ghz and 143  ghz channels . the specification of noise level and beam size of each channel",
    "are specified in , for instance , table i of ref .",
    "but while _ planck _ data has been partially released and a likelihood is publicly available  @xcite , the current _ planck _ low-@xmath30 polarization data is still being analyzed and the final constraint on cosmology is not yet known .",
    "thus , we use a simplified fisher matrix analysis here as an ideal case simulating a future ( improved ) constraint of the _ planck _ cmb .    the observed galaxy power spectrum is modeled as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the redshift , @xmath33 is the cosine of the angle between the wavenumber @xmath34 and the line of sight , @xmath35 is the galaxy bias , @xmath36 is the linear growth factor , @xmath37 is the linear growth rate , @xmath38 is the matter power spectrum today ( at redshift @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 is the parameterization of the effect of small - scale velocity dispersion and redshift errors : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hubble parameter as a function of redshift .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider a future galaxy survey with spectroscopic @xmath43 . the galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath44 is treated as a nuisance parameter with gaussian prior @xmath45 .",
    "we use 8 redshift bins from @xmath46 to @xmath47 with uniform bin size @xmath48 . in each redshift bin",
    "we apply an ir cut @xmath49 to account for the band limit due to a finite survey volume , and a uv cut @xmath50 to guarantee that only linear scales are used .",
    "bias in each redshift bin is considered as a nuisance parameter with flat prior @xmath51 . the mean galaxy number density @xmath52 which gives the poisson noise term @xmath53",
    "is assumed to be known .",
    "for all redshift bins , we assume a sky coverage @xmath54 .",
    "more details about the specifications are provided in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the type ia supernova apparent magnitude is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the absolute magnitude for which we assume a gaussian prior @xmath57 mags .",
    "we assume a _",
    "wfirst_-like observation with 2725 supernovae up to redshift @xmath58",
    "@xcite . the overall statistical error in a @xmath59 redshift bin",
    "is modeled as : @xmath60 where the photometric measurement error @xmath61 mags , the intrinsic dispersion in type ia supernova absolute magnitude @xmath62 mags , the statistical error due to gravitational lensing magnification @xmath63 mags , and the uncertainty due to supernova peculiar velocity @xmath64 $ ] with a typical velocity @xmath65 . finally , we add a systematic uncertainty @xmath66 to each redshift bin to account for calibration errors between different bins  @xcite .    within modified gravity models ,",
    "there are several ways to define the `` equation of state '' @xmath2 of dark energy .",
    "we use a definition based on the background expansion history in the jordan frame : @xmath67   \\ , , \\\\",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the ratio between matter ( relativistic ) energy density and the critical density @xmath69 , @xmath70 being newton s gravitational constant and @xmath5 the hubble constant ( i.e. , the hubble parameter today ) . in general , a subscript `` 0 '' denotes a quantity measured at redshift zero .",
    "we take three benchmark examples to show the effect of marginalization : ( a ) fixing all other cosmological parameters and nuisance parameters ; ( b ) fixing other cosmological parameters and only marginalizing over nuisance parameters ; ( c ) marginalizing over all other cosmological parameters and nuisance parameters . model",
    "a corresponds to an unmarginalized constraint and can be directly compared to ref .",
    "model b is an ideal case assuming that additional experiments ( e.g. , cmb stage iv @xcite ) will measure other cosmological parameters to a much better accuracy .",
    "model c is a fully marginalized forecast using the aforementioned datasets .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite in parameterizing eft dark energy : the equation of state @xmath2 is assumed to be a constant , while the other eft functions are parameterized as @xmath71 finally , we take @xmath72 in accordance with horndeski gravity models . for simplicity",
    ", the dark energy fraction density ratio @xmath73 is defined for a fixed @xmath3cdm model with @xmath74 .",
    "note that each @xmath75 may be fixed to fiducial values or allowed to vary .",
    "we therefore consider two cases : ( i ) , where we vary each @xmath75 and @xmath2 individually and keep the remaining fixed , and ( ii ) , where we vary all @xmath75 and @xmath2 simultaneously . the standard deviation @xmath76 , representing the 68% cl error ,",
    "is then used as a measure of the constraint upon each parameter ( or equivalently , its uncertainty ) .",
    "standard deviations in case ii are determined by marginalizing over all other @xmath75 and @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , any dependencies or correlations amongst the eft parameters can be revealed by simply comparing the constraints upon them between the two cases .",
    "we use the cosmology object oriented package ( coop )  @xcite to compute the fisher matrices .",

    "each inner ellipse corresponds to the 68% confidence level error and the outer to the 95% . ]",
    "by considering three cases with different levels of marginalization , we have shown that marginalization can weaken the constraints on the eft parameters by a factor of a few .",
    "results for the first case of model a can be directly compared with ref .",
    "@xcite , which also projected @xmath16@xmath1 for unmarginalized 68% cl errors using a different dataset .",
    "this value worsened by a few factors after we marginalized over the nuisance parameters ( model b ) , and worsened more so after marginalizing over all cosmological and nuisance parameters ( model c ) .",
    "our constraint on the dark energy equation of state @xmath2 is on par with the level of uncertainty achievable with the most advanced upcoming probes ( @xmath77 in a @xmath2cdm model ) .",
    "critically , allowing the @xmath75 to vary weakens the constraint on @xmath2 by less than @xmath78 ",
    "well within experimental error  meaning that @xmath2cdm forecasts for future experiments remain valid . since these upcoming probes already edge on the cosmic variance limit for @xmath2 , we must also constrain @xmath75 to distinguish between a @xmath2cdm and a modified gravity universe . to that end , we obtain uncertainties of @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for comparison ,",
    "_ planck _ currently achieves an uncertainty on the order @xmath81 @xcite .    that the forthcoming generation of dark energy probes is approaching the cosmic variance limit is important for another reason : as we approach that limit , cosmic variance itself becomes a significant part of the uncertainties .",
    "the standard approach for reducing these uncertainties and breaking degeneracies is to combine different cosmological observations such as galaxy and weak lensing power spectra and the isw  galaxy - distribution correlation .",
    "since these experiments all observe the same sky , the cosmic variance overlaps and so their fisher matrices are correlated . in other words",
    ", these fisher matrices can not be added trivially , and proper treatment requires significant analysis of the relevant datasets to remove the correlations .",
    "we leave this analysis to future work ."
