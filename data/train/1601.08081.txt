    "an effective tool to study the space - time structure of the production amplitude is to measure the bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) between two identical particles produced in the inclusive hadron interaction , see , for example , hbt@xmath5@xcite .",
    "consider the situation where we have one pion with momentum @xmath6 emitted at point @xmath7 and another identical pion with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the inclusive cross section for the two identical particles takes the form  =  |m|^22 + 2e^irq  =  |m|^2  1+e^irq , where @xmath10 is the production amplitude , and where 4-vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 denote the averaging over @xmath7 and @xmath9 , the @xmath14 term is due to the permutation of the identical pions ; that is , it allows for the pion with @xmath8 to be emitted from the point @xmath7 and simultaneously for @xmath6 from @xmath9 . as a rule",
    "the @xmath15 dependence of the amplitude @xmath10 is relatively flat in comparison with the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath14 .",
    "thus we are able to evaluate the size of the pion production domain by studying the @xmath15 dependence of the whole cross section @xmath16 .    to extract the effect we compare the measured @xmath15 spectrum with a similar one but without bec . to be precise",
    "we form the ratio r(q )  =   [ eq : rq ] where @xmath17 is the two pion distribution integrated over all the variables except @xmath15 , and @xmath18 is the distribution expected in a world without bec .",
    "there are different ways to choose @xmath19 .",
    "we may measure the @xmath20 distribution for non - identical pions ; or we may change the sign of the three momentum of the second pion @xmath21 ; and so on . none of these approaches compensates for the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath10 completely ; but for the conventional ` one - radius ' fit r(q )  =  e^-|r q [ eq : rq1 ] the different values of the mean radius , is such that @xmath22 approximates the value of @xmath14 averaged over @xmath7 and @xmath9 . ] , @xmath23 , extracted from the data are close to each other .",
    "such analyses of high energy proton - proton interactions at the lhc have been performed by atlas @xcite , cms @xcite and alice @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the value of @xmath24 turns out to be less than 1 . in particular ,",
    "cms claim the @xmath25 @xcite . on the other hand from ( [ eq : rq ] ) we expect @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , it is clear from fig .  1 of @xcite , and the analogous plots of other groups , that the fit does not describe the very low q data points .",
    "this indicates that there should be another component of @xmath27 with a larger radius populating the region of small @xmath15 .",
    "in the present paper we argue that the expected structure of the pion emission domain is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "we should consider _ small _ size pion sources distributed in the much larger area of the proton - proton interaction .",
    "that is , we are led to parametrize @xmath27 by two different mean radii .",
    "we explain the physical origin of this situation below .",
    "it was shown long ago that to describe a high energy ( say , proton - proton ) interaction it is convenient to first select the subset of diagrams which provides the interaction across a large rapidity gap , and whose contribution does not decrease when the rapidity separation increases @xcite .",
    "the resulting ladder - like set of diagrams forms reggeon exchange . in terms of the hadronic degrees of freedom",
    "the corresponding subset of diagrams  called multiperipheral ladder diagrams ( fig .",
    "1(a ) )  was studied first by amati el al . @xcite . in terms of qcd",
    "they form the bfkl pomeron @xcite . in a general purpose monte carlo",
    "these are the diagrams for the dglap evolution amplitude ( fig .",
    "recall that it is not sufficient to consider only one ladder . to describe multiparticle production we have to consider the possibility of the exchange of a few ladders ( reggeons ) , see fig .",
    "1(c ) . in a monte carlo",
    "this is called the multiple interaction ( mi ) option .        already at this stage",
    "we observe two quite different scales .",
    "the slope , @xmath28 , of elastic proton - proton scattering is usually parametrized in the form b_el(s )  =  b_0 + 2_pln(s / s_0 ) , [ eq : slope ] where the constant @xmath29 is driven by the size of an incoming proton . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath30 reflects the internal transverse size of the ladder .",
    "based on the pre - lhc data , typical numbers are @xmath31 gev@xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .    strictly speaking , ( [ eq : slope ] ) corresponds to one - ladder ( reggeon ) exchange . at very high energies the speed of the shrinkage of the diffraction cone increases due to the stronger screening of the amplitude in the centre of the disc , at small impact parameters",
    "asymptotically , in the black disc limit , where the total cross section grows as ln@xmath34 , the slope @xmath35 also increases as ln@xmath36 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that indeed the high energy lhc data indicate the presence of a ln@xmath34 component in the elastic slope which is consistent with the growth of the total cross section .",
    "however if we consider an individual ladder then the effective value of @xmath30 in the ladder even decreases with energy due to the larger available @xmath37 space for the intermediate partons .",
    "it is known that @xmath38 in the bfkl case .",
    "another example is the monte carlo description of multiparticle production . in order to tune the generator to",
    "the high energy data one has to introduce an infrared cutoff , @xmath39 whose value grows as @xmath40 @xcite  that is , the transverse size of the ladder decreases .",
    "thus the interaction of two high energy protons should be described by a diagram like fig.1(c ) in which the size of each individual ladder is rather small ( as seen from the small value of @xmath30 ) . yet",
    "the separation between the ladders is of the order of the radius of the interaction amplitude which should be correlated with the total value of @xmath35 .",
    "with increasing energy we expect the transverse size of an individual ladder ( measured in the central rapidity interval ) will decrease ( as indicated by the behaviour of @xmath41 ) . on the other hand the separation between the ladders",
    "is expected to increase , as indicated by the behaviour of @xmath35 .",
    "having the above picture in mind , we expect in bec to observe a new object  a small - size pion source . in other words ,",
    "bec should be described by two different radii .",
    "one radius corresponds to the case when both pions are emitted from the same ladder  this will measure the size of an individual ` pomeron ' . since the pion is not a point - like object the radius will be smeared out by fluctuations in the process of the formation of the pions .",
    "the second radius will correspond to the pions being emitted from two different ladders ",
    "it is a measure of the separation between the ladders .",
    "therefore we propose to fit the observed correlation @xmath27 by a formula with two different mean radii ) , other parametric forms may be considered for each term .",
    "for example , the second term may be a gaussian , @xmath42 .",
    "the choice should be based on statistical criteria or on the relative strength of the two terms . ]",
    "r(q )  =  e^-|r_1 q + ( 1- )  e^-|r_2 q , [ eq : rq2 ] which better reflects the complicated structure of the pion emission domain . in the ideal case",
    "we expect the low multiplicity events to be produced via a diagram with only one ` cut ' pomeron exchange ( fig .",
    "in general there may be more pomerons in the whole amplitude , but only one ladder radiates the secondaries . as the multiplicity becomes larger the secondaries are mainly emitted from a few different ladders , and the probability to find the two identical pions originating from the same pomeron decreases .",
    "that is , we expect the relative contribution @xmath24 of the large component ( described by , say , @xmath43 ) to increase with @xmath44 , while on the other hand , the strength of the small size component @xmath45 decreases .",
    "unfortunately we can not predict that @xmath46 as @xmath47 , and that @xmath48 for very large @xmath44 .",
    "the situation is complicated by the strong fluctuations of the number of secondaries in each ladder ( or pomeron ) .",
    "recall that actually we do not measure the total charged multiplicity of an event , but rather the number of secondaries in a limited central rapidity interval ( like @xmath49 in the case of atlas and cms ) .",
    "then the multiplicity corresponding to one pomeron is relatively small ( @xmath50 ) and the fluctuations strongly wash out the relation between the measured values and the number of cut pomerons .",
    "moreover for very low @xmath44 we may sample contributions from diffractive dissociation which have a qualitatively different structure . nevertheless at large",
    "@xmath44 the multipomeron contribution dominates ; that is bec are driven mainly by the component with the largest radius , @xmath51 .",
    "indeed it is seen in fig .",
    "3(b ) of @xcite that , in the _ one _ radius fit , ( [ eq : rq1 ] ) , the radius increases with multiplicity reaching _ saturation _ of @xmath52fm for @xmath53 .",
    "such saturation was predicted in @xcite , where it was explained that the radius measured in a one - radius fit , is driven , not by the initial energy , but mainly by the number of cut pomerons , @xmath54 .",
    "indeed , the radius of the individual pomeron depends weakly on energy ( @xmath55 const . ) , while the number of cut pomerons observed in the event ( that is the separated pion sources ) is proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "so the probability to have two identical pions from two different sources increases with @xmath44 .",
    "when @xmath57 ( at low @xmath44 ) we observe one pomeron and measure its radius .",
    "on the other hand , for large @xmath44 we study the separation between the pomerons and the value of @xmath58 is saturated at the radius of the interaction amplitude @xmath59 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath60 gev@xmath32 @xcite corresponds in a ` one - radius ' fit to @xmath61fm , which is in good agreement with fig .",
    "3(b ) of the atlas fit @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the separation between the pomerons ( the pion sources ) is not equal to the incoming hadron ( proton ) radius .",
    "first note , the radius corresponding to the interaction amplitude is larger .",
    "it increases with energy .",
    "recall that in each successive step of the ladder in fig .  1 the impact parameter changes by @xmath62 .",
    "this leads to a diffusion in @xmath63 , which results in the second ( or @xmath64 ) term in the equation for the elastic slope , ( [ eq : slope ] ) .",
    "next , the pion is not a point - like particle and its formation also occupies some volume .",
    "finally , there may be an interaction between the final state secondaries .    strictly speaking the picture that we describe above corresponds to the initial stage of the interaction , and",
    "does not allow for possible final state rescattering .",
    "if there are final state interactions ( either in terms of a hadron gas or a quark - gluon plasma ) then bec will measure the radius given by the point of the last interaction  that is , the domain occupied by secondaries is extended up to the stage where the particle density becomes so low that further interaction is very unlikely , and the size of the domain at which the last interaction occurs will be seen in bec . the probability of final state rescattering increases with particle density @xmath44 .",
    "if this contribution were to dominate , then it is natural to expect @xmath65 .",
    "however , the data of fig .",
    "3(b ) of @xcite do not show any evidence of such a behaviour for large @xmath44 .",
    "so what are the expectations of the ` two - radii ' fit ?",
    "the contribution of small raduis dominates at low @xmath44 and decreases with increasing @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the value of the small radius , @xmath66 , is almost independent of energy ",
    "there is a small tendency to decrease due to a larger @xmath37 in the ladder ( see , for example @xcite ) . on the other hand , the strength of the @xmath51 component increases with @xmath44  the value of the radius , @xmath51 , correlated with @xmath28 ( that is , the radius of interaction of the incoming protons ) slowly increases with energy . at asymptotic energies we expect @xmath67 .",
    "a tendency already seen in lhc data @xcite .",
    "therefore for @xmath68 we expect @xmath69ln@xmath70 .",
    "however , the coefficient @xmath71 is numerically quite small .    for very large @xmath44 the value or @xmath51 may additionally increase due to the final state rescattering , as was discussed above .",
    "however it is not seen in the 7 tev @xmath72 collision data .",
    "here we discuss the dependence of the radii , @xmath73 , on the transverse momentum of the identical pair , @xmath74 , first , we make a trivial remark  for larger @xmath37 we have better space resolution in implementing the bec method . at low @xmath37",
    "it may be hard to distinguish between @xmath51 and @xmath66 components , since the radii @xmath51 and @xmath66 will be larger than that measured at large @xmath37 due to uncertainty principle smearing , and thus closer to each other .",
    "recall that the probability to produce two large @xmath37 pions from differents ladders ( pomerons ) decreases with increasing @xmath37 as the single particle inclusive cross section decreases steeply with @xmath37 .",
    "that is , two identical pions , each with large @xmath37 , should be produced from the same large @xmath37 jet .",
    "so with increasing @xmath37 of the pair we expect a large contribution from the @xmath66 component with the value of @xmath66 decreasing , reaching saturation corresponding to the jet size . to be more precise , we mean the size of pion formation due to the hadronization of large @xmath37 jets .",
    "this tendency of @xmath58 to decrease with increasing @xmath37 was indeed observed in a ` one - radii ' fit of lhc data , see figs .",
    "5,6 of @xcite .",
    "however , the value of @xmath37 was not sufficiently large to see saturation in these plots .",
    "another effect at very large @xmath37 , which may give an important contribution to large @xmath44 events , concerns the multiplicity of jets which increase as exp@xmath75 , see , for example ,  @xcite .",
    "however the high @xmath76 jet cross section is too small to identify this effect in the present data .",
    "we emphasize that the dynamics of high energy hadron interactions is based on subamplitudes of small transverse size which are distributed over the whole domain occupied by the full interaction amplitude .",
    "thus , in bec we have to observe a small size object corresponding to the emission of both pions ( or both kaons etc . ) from a single subamplitude and a larger radius caused by events where the pions are produced from different subamplitudes . at large @xmath44 the relative contribution of the large radius component increase . enlarging the @xmath37 of the identical pion pair",
    "we improve the space resolution of the bec analyzer .",
    "this allows a better separation of the contributions from the small and large radii components .",
    "when @xmath37 becomes too large ( say , @xmath77 gev ) the probability to produce such large @xmath37 pions from two different subamplitudes becomes small . in this case bec measure the radius of the ` jet ' which emits this high @xmath37 pair of identical pions .",
    "that is , we expect the radius to decrease with increasing @xmath37 , reaching _ saturation _ for @xmath78 gev .",
