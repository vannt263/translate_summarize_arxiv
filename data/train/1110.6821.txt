    "hoffman graphs were introduced by woo and neumaier @xcite to extend the results of hoffman @xcite .",
    "hoffman proved what we would call hoffman s limit theorem ( theorem  [ lim2 ] ) which asserts that , in the language of hoffman graphs , the smallest eigenvalue of a fat hoffman graph is a limit of the smallest eigenvalues of a sequence of ordinary graphs with increasing minimum degree .",
    "woo and neumaier @xcite gave a complete list of fat indecomposable hoffman graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least @xmath8 . from their list , we find that only @xmath9 and @xmath8 appear as the smallest eigenvalues .",
    "this implies , in particular , that @xmath9 and @xmath8 are limit points of the smallest eigenvalues of a sequence of ordinary graphs with increasing minimum degree .",
    "it turns out that there are no others between @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "more precisely , for a negative real number @xmath11 , consider the sequences @xmath12 where @xmath13 runs through graphs satisfying the conditions specified above , namely , @xmath13 has minimum degree at least @xmath14 and @xmath13 has smallest eigenvalue greater than ( or less than ) @xmath11 .",
    "then hoffman @xcite has shown that @xmath15\\\\ \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\eta^{(-1-\\sqrt{2})}_k&=-2,\\quad & \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\theta^{(-2)}_k&=-1-\\sqrt{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , real numbers in @xmath16 and @xmath17 are ignorable if our concern is the smallest eigenvalues of graphs with large minimum degree .",
    "woo and neumaier @xcite went on to prove that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a zero of the cubic polynomial @xmath20 . recently , yu @xcite has shown that analogous results for regular graphs also hold .    woo and neumaier ( * ? ? ?",
    "* open problem 4 ) raised the problem of classifying fat hoffman graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least @xmath0 .",
    "they also proposed a generalization of a concept of a line graph based on a family of isomorphism classes of hoffman graphs .",
    "this enables one to define generalized line graphs in a very simple manner .",
    "as we shall see in proposition  [ prop : line ] , the knowledge of @xmath21-saturatedindecomposable fat hoffman graphs gives a description of all fat hoffman graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath22 , this in turn should give some information on the limit points of the smallest eigenvalues of a sequence of ordinary graphs with increasing minimum degree .",
    "also , using the generalized concept of line graphs , we can expect to give a description of all graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least @xmath0 and sufficiently large minimum degree .",
    "thus our ultimate goal is to classify @xmath23-saturated  indecomposable fat hoffman graphs , as proposed by woo and neumaier @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to begin the first step of this classification , by determining their special graphs for such hoffman graphs having an integral reduced representation .",
    "one of our main result is that the special graph @xmath3 of such a hoffman graph @xmath2 is isomorphic to one of the dynkin graphs @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or extended dynkin graphs @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "we also show that , even when the hoffman graph @xmath2 does not admit an integral representation , its special graph @xmath1 can be represented by one of the exceptional root lattices @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this might mean that the rest of the work can be completed by a computer as in the classification of maximal exceptional graphs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , if one attaches a fat neighbor to every slim vertex of an ordinary maximal exceptional graph , then we obtain a @xmath23-indecomposable fat hoffman graph .",
    "however , maximal graphs among @xmath23-indecomposable fat hoffman graphs represented in @xmath26 are usually much larger ( see example  [ ex : me8 ] and the comment following it ) , so the problem is not as trivial as it looks .",
    "we plan to discuss in the subsequent papers the determination of these special graphs and the corresponding hoffman graphs .",
    "in this subsection we discuss the basic theory of hoffman graphs .",
    "hoffman graphs were introduced by woo and neumaier @xcite , and most of this section is due to them .",
    "since the sums of hoffman graphs appear only implicitly in @xcite and later formulated by taniguchi @xcite , we will give proof of the results that use sums for the convenience of the reader .",
