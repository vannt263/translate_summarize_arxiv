    "solid - state systems are among the most promising candidates for future quantum information processing devices .",
    "one type of such systems are superconductor- and semiconductor - based charge qubits @xcite .",
    "these qubits are commonly measured by capacitively coupling them to quantum point contacts ( qpc ) or single - electron transistors ( set ) , such that the current in the detector is sensitive to the charge state of the qubit @xcite . by measuring the current passing through the detector",
    ", one can infer the state of the qubit .",
    "one limitation that arises in practical situations is that , in order to minimize the effects of the detector on the qubit before the measurement , the qubit - detector coupling strength is set to a value that is small compared to the qubit s energy scale @xcite . as a result one must deal with some form of weak - measurement regime .",
    "this type of weak , charge - sensitive readout works well when the qubit is biased such that the charge states are eigenstates of the hamiltonian and therefore do not mix during the measurement . in this case",
    "one can allow the detector to probe the qubit for as long as is needed to obtain a high signal - to - noise ratio , without having to worry about any coherent qubit dynamics ( note that , since we are mainly interested in the measurement process , we ignore any additional qubit decoherence mechanisms in the system , which could impose constraints on the allowed measurement time ) .",
    "in contrast to the simple situation described above , when the detector weakly probes the charge state of the qubit while the hamiltonian induces mixing dynamics between the different charge states , it becomes unclear how to interpret a given measurement signal .",
    "since the signal typically contains a large amount of detector - related noise and the measurement unavoidably destroys the coherence present in the qubit s initial state , it might seem that this type of measurement can not be used to determine the initial state of the qubit , i.e.  at the time that the experimenter decides to perform the measurement .",
    "indeed , there have been a number of studies analyzing the measurement - induced decoherence and the evolution of the qubit s state in this situation @xcite , but not the question of how to take the measurement data and extract from it information about the initial state of the qubit .",
    "this question is a key issue for qubit - state readout and is the main subject of this paper .",
    "we shall show below that high - fidelity information can be extracted from the measurement data , provided that additional decoherence mechanisms are weak and the readout signal can be monitored at a sufficiently short timescale .",
    "it turns out that not only the measurement result , but also the measurement basis is determined stochastically in this case . in spite of the uncontrollability of the measurement basis ,",
    "the measurement results correspond properly to the initial state of the qubit . as an example",
    ", we show how they can be used to perform quantum state tomography on the qubit .",
    "these results show that under suitable conditions and by proper analysis of the measurement data useful information about the state of the qubit can be obtained .",
    "is much smaller than the widths of the distributions , the qpc performs a weak measurement on the qubit in the short interval under consideration .",
    "in plotting ( b ) we have assumed that @xmath0 , which would be the case if the qubit is defined by an extra positive charge ( e.g.  a hole ) tunneling between the two wells . taking the opposite case , i.e.  @xmath1 ,",
    "would not have any effect on the analysis of this paper.,width=302 ]    we consider a system composed of a charge qubit capacitively coupled to a qpc , as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the qubit can be viewed as a system where a charged particle is trapped in a double well potential and can occupy , and tunnel between , the localized ground states of the two wells .",
    "we shall denote these states by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    during the measurement a voltage",
    "is applied to the qpc , and a current flows through it .",
    "we assume that the qpc measures the qubit in the @xmath4 basis ; the current through the qpc depends on whether the qubit is in the state @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "we further assume that the qpc does not induce any decoherence in the qubit s state except that associated with the measurement - induced projection . for purposes of fully characterizing the operation of the qpc as a detector for the state of the qubit , it is convenient to make a few statements about the qpc s operation when the qubit hamiltonian is diagonal in the charge basis and the qubit is initialized in one of the states of the charge basis .",
    "in this case , there is no mechanism by which the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 mix during the system dynamics .",
    "if the qubit is initially in the state @xmath2 , the long - time - averaged qpc current is given by @xmath5 , and the qubit remains in the state @xmath2 .",
    "a similar statement applies to the state @xmath3 of the qubit , with corresponding qpc current @xmath6 .",
    "the qpc current therefore serves as an indicator of the qubit s state in the charge basis @xmath4 , as long as the qubit hamiltonian does not mix the states of this basis .    on any finite timescale",
    ", there will be fluctuations in the qpc current , and the observed value might deviate from @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the longer the period over which the averaging is made , the smaller the fluctuations .",
    "one can therefore define a measurement timescale that determines how long one needs to wait in order to distinguish between the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the relation between this timescale and the qubit s hamiltonian - induced precession period separates two measurement regimes : fast versus slow measurement , or alternatively strong versus weak qubit - detector coupling .",
    "note that this distinction is irrelevant when the qubit hamiltonian is diagonal in the charge basis , since there is no mixing between the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 in this case .    for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we analyze the general case where the qubit hamiltonian is not necessarily diagonal in the charge basis .",
    "we shall use the basis in which the qubit hamiltonian is diagonal , thus @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy splitting between the qubit s two energy levels , and @xmath9 is the @xmath10-axis pauli matrix .",
    "we shall denote the ground and excited states of the hamiltonian by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the states of the charge basis can be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the angle between the charge basis and the energy eigenbasis .",
    "we start our analysis by considering a short time interval between times @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that during this time interval a large number of electrons tunnel through the qpc , such that it is natural to define a qpc current @xmath17 during this short interval .",
    "we also assume that a weak - measurement regime exists for a properly chosen value of @xmath18 , which means that the qpc - current probability densities ( for the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) are broad and almost completely overlap , as shown in fig .",
    "for definiteness we shall take these probability densities to be time - independent , gaussian functions .",
    "the interval @xmath19 is taken to be much longer than the coherence time of the qpc , such that the qpc s operation during this interval is independent of the qpc s state at earlier times . finally , we take @xmath19 to be much shorter than the precession period of the qubit .",
    "we now construct matrices ( or propagators ) that describe the qubit - state evolution depending on the observed qpc current @xmath17 : when a given value of @xmath17 is observed in the qpc , the quantum state of the qubit is projected ( possibly partially ) according to the observed value .",
    "neglecting decoherence that is not associated with the measurement , the projection of the qubit s state is described by a @xmath20 matrix that we shall call @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 defines the size of a finite interval of qpc currents that we identify with a single value : @xmath23 \\ ; \\rho_{\\rm q}(t ) \\ ; \\hat{u}_m^{\\dagger}[i,\\delta i,\\delta t ] , \\label{eq : projection}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the qubit s density matrix , and @xmath25 represents the complex conjugate transpose .",
    "one could say that with the introduction of @xmath22 we are turning the probability distributions in fig .",
    "1(b ) into histograms with discrete possible outcomes ( this discretization will also be used in our numerical calculations below ) . in order to identify the appropriate form for @xmath21 $ ]",

    "this matrix can then be used to determine the measurement basis , the measurement result ( i.e.  @xmath54 along the measurement axis ) , the fidelity ( or in other words the degree of certainty about the obtained measurement result ) and the final state of the qubit ( given by the measurement result transformed by the unitary , i.e.  rotation , matrix @xmath55 $ ] ) . note that when the measurement fidelity approaches one , the final state is a pure state that can be determined even without any _ a priori _ knowledge about the initial state .",
    "we now present the results of our numerical calculations .",

    "we also discretize the possible values of qpc current .",
    "we have verified that the results presented below are insensitive to the exact discretization parameters , as long as we take @xmath57 and there are a large number of possible qpc current values .",

    "this matrix is then used to extract the measurement basis and fidelity .",
    "the strength of the qubit - qpc coupling is determined by the relation between two parameters in the numerical calculations : ( 1 ) the width , or standard deviation @xmath58 , of the qpc - current distribution functions and ( 2 ) the distance between the average values of these distribution functions @xmath59 .",
    "it is more convenient , however , to present the results in terms of a different parameter that characterizes the qubit - qpc coupling strength , namely @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the timescale needed to obtain sufficient qpc signal to read out the state of the qubit ( for the time being one can think of this definition as applying to the case when @xmath62 ; but see below ) .",

    "2 we show the spherical coordinates of the ( stochastically determined ) measurement bases for different levels of qubit - detector coupling . in the strong - coupling , fast - measurement regime ( fig .",
    "2a ) , the measurement basis is always the charge basis , which is the natural measurement basis for the detector under consideration . as the qubit - detector coupling strength is reduced ( fig .",
    "2b ) , the measurement bases start to deviate from the charge basis , and they develop some statistical spread .",
    "this region could be called the intermediate - coupling regime . in the weak - coupling , slow - measurement regime ( fig .  2c ) ,",
    "the measurement bases are spread over all the possible directions .     between the charge basis and the energy eigenbasis : @xmath62 ( red ; lowest line ) , @xmath74 ( green ) and @xmath75 ( blue ) .",

    "the fidelity increases as the measurement duration increases , but the fidelity is essentially independent of the angle @xmath14.,width=226 ]    in fig .  3 , we plot the measurement fidelity as a function of measurement duration for three different values of @xmath14 , keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "we can see that the fidelity approaches one for long enough measurement duration , regardless of the angle @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , the fidelity is almost independent of @xmath14 .",
    "this result shows that even though more complicated analysis is needed to extract useful measurement information when @xmath76 , the information acquisition rate is only slightly affected by the coherent , hamiltonian - induced precession .",
    "the fact that the measurement basis is generally unpredictable , and therefore uncontrollable , is a rather strange phenomenon from a fundamental point of view . from a practical point of view",
    ", one can wonder whether anything useful can be done with such measurements that are performed in a stochastically determined basis . if one absolutely requires a measurement in a given basis , measurement results in different bases would be less useful .",
    "one could then treat the deviation of the observed measurement basis from the desired one as an experimental error and deal with it accordingly .    in the above discussion",
    ", we have ignored any decoherence other than that associated with the measurement - induced projection .",
    "if the measurement time @xmath61 is much smaller than the timescale of decoherence caused by other mechanisms , the measurement is completed with minimal effects of any additional decoherence .",
    "our results are valid in this case .",
    "a number of different types of detectors , including qpcs , are approaching this limit where the decoherence is limited by the measurement @xcite , indicating that our results could be observable in such systems .    _",
    "quantum state tomography. _",
    "one example of a procedure where the uncontrollability of the measurement basis can be harmless is quantum state tomography ( qst ) . in qst , one",
    "is given a large number of copies of the same quantum state , and the goal is to deduce this state .",
    "typically , one measures the operator @xmath77 for one third of the copies , and similarly for @xmath78 and @xmath9 .",
    "once the average values @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are known , the density matrix is reconstructed straightforwardly : @xmath82    in the present case , the measurement bases are chosen stochastically , and in principle no two of them are the same .",
    "one must therefore reconstruct the unknown quantum state using a procedure that allows for data taken from measurements made in any combination of bases .",
    "one such procedure is the minimization of the function @xmath83 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath67 are the spherical coordinates of a point in the bloch sphere ; @xmath29 is an index labelling the different runs of the experiment ; the direction ( @xmath86 ) defines the qubit state obtained in a given measurement ; and @xmath87 is the angle between the directions @xmath88 and @xmath89 . assuming that the measurement bases cover all possible directions ( see e.g.  fig .",
    "2c ) , the convergence of this procedure to the correct density matrix should be similar to the convergence of the standard qst procedure explained in the previous paragraph .",
    "we have simulated qst by repeating the measurement procedure a large number of times , obtaining a set of measurement results ( in the form of pre - measurement qubit states ) , and then minimizing the function @xmath90 with the respect to @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath67 .",
    "we have chosen several initial states covering the bloch sphere , and the tomography procedure consistently produced the initial state of the qubit for the parameters of figs .",
    "2(b , c ) . for strong qubit - detector coupling",
    "[ see fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , the procedure becomes unreliable , because the vast majority of the measurements are performed in one basis .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the question of what information can be extracted from the output signal of a qpc that weakly probes the charge state of a charge qubit when the qubit hamiltonian induces oscillations between the different charge states .",
    "we have shown that the measurement basis is determined stochastically every time the measurement is repeated . in the case of weak qubit - detector coupling , the possible measurement bases cover all the possible directions . the measurement basis and result",
    "can both be extracted from the qpc output signal . we have also shown that the information acquisition rate is independent of the angle @xmath14 between the direction defining the charge basis and that defining the qubit hamiltonian .",
    "in other words , given enough time , the detector will produce a high - fidelity measurement result , regardless of the value of @xmath14 .",
    "these results show that , under suitable conditions and by proper analysis , the detector s ability to obtain high - fidelity information about the state of the qubit is not affected by the competition between the measurement and coherent - precession dynamics",
