    "the construction of efficient representations of multi - variate integral operators plays a crucial role in the numerics of higher dimensional problems arising in a wide range of modern applications .",
    "let us mention multi - dimensional integral equations and volume potentials of elliptic and parabolic partial differential operators in @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "in the present paper we study the combination of high - order semi - analytic cubature formulas for volume potentials with modern methods of structured tensor product approximations .",
    "the cubature formulas have been obtained in @xcite using the method of approximate approximations , see also @xcite and the reference therein .",
    "the application of tensor product approximations to the approximation of volume potentials is described for example in @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to derive accurate tensor product approximations of the density @xmath2 and the kernel @xmath3 of the convolution integral of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 such that the convolution integral can be approximated by one - dimensional convolutions @xmath7 then the numerical computation of the integral does not require to perform an @xmath8-dimensional discrete convolution , for example , instead one has to compute @xmath9 one - dimensional discrete convolutions , which can lead to a considerable reduction of computing time and memory requirements , and gives the possibility to treat real world problems .    in this note we present some variants for the tensor product approximation of high order cubature for harmonic , yukawa and heat potentials as integral operators in @xmath0 . after a brief introduction into cubature formulas based on approximate approximations and their error behavior ,",
    "we describe their representations as one - dimensional integrals suitable for tensor product approximation . for the example of the harmonic potential in @xmath0 , @xmath10",
    ", we report on numerical tests for second and fourth order formulas , which provide estimates of the tensor rank required to approximate the action of the potential on a basis function with a prescribed relative error .",
    "further we report on numerical tests for the yukawa potential , which can be approximated accurately with a very small number of tensors in a wide range of arguments .",
    "in the final section [ scnheat ] we study the volume heat potential in @xmath0 , derive approximation results and describe its tensor product approximation .",
    "here we collect some results on high - order cubature formulas for the volume potentials of the differential operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , in @xmath0 .",
    "the harmonic potential is the inverse of the laplace operator and given in @xmath0 by the formula @xmath14 the volume potential provides the unique solution of the poisson equation @xmath15 the theory of _ approximate approximations _ proposes semi - analytic cubature formulas for harmonic potentials by using quasi - interpolation of the density @xmath2 by functions for which the integral operator can be taken analytically .",
    "for example , approximate @xmath2 by the quasi - interpolant @xmath16 with a suitable generating function @xmath17 .",
    "then the sum @xmath18 is a cubature of the harmonic potential .",
    "if one wants to compute the harmonic potential of @xmath2 on the given grid @xmath19 then one has to compute the discrete convolution @xmath20 with the coefficients @xmath21 it has been shown that for sufficiently smooth and compactly supported functions the cubature formula provide approximations with the error @xmath22 if the function @xmath17 is chosen as @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the generalized laguerre polynomials @xmath25 additionally , there holds the analytic representation @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the lower incomplete gamma function defined by @xmath28 in the case @xmath29 @xmath30 whereas for odd space dimension @xmath8 one can use @xmath31 with the error function @xmath32 and the recurrence relation @xmath33 to derive analytic expressions for @xmath34 .",
    "the asymptotic error estimate @xmath22 for the cubature formula is based on the error estimate @xmath35 for the quasi - interpolant if the sufficiently smooth and decaying generating function @xmath17 is subject to the moment condition @xmath36 the saturation error @xmath37 does not converge to zero for @xmath38 , but because of @xmath39 can be made arbitrarily small if the parameter @xmath40 is sufficiently large . additionally , the harmonic potential maps the fast oscillating saturation term into a function with norm of order @xmath41 , which establishes the error estimate @xmath22 for the approximation of the harmonic potential by using quasi - interpolation of the density with the generating function .",
    "so in numerical computations with @xmath42 the formulas ( [ conapp1]-[ch9eta ] ) behave like high order cubature formulas for harmonic potentials in @xmath0 .",
    "the approximation of the potential on the grid @xmath19 can be done by fast convolutional methods , but one has to store the values @xmath43 for a quite large subset of @xmath44 .",
    "the fundamental solution of the operator @xmath45 , @xmath46 in @xmath0 is given as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the modified bessel function of the second kind , also known as macdonald function , @xcite .",
    "thus the volume potential @xmath49 for @xmath50 also called yukawa potential , provides the solution of the equation @xmath51    to derive a cubature formula for that potential we look for a solution of @xmath52 which is given as the one - dimensional integral @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the modified bessel function of the first kind , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) .    using the known analytic expressions of @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) it is possible to derive analytic formula of for odd space dimension @xmath8 . in particular , if @xmath50 , then @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the scaled complementary error function @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the complementary error function .",
    "using the representation from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.5 ) @xmath61 one can derive as in the case of harmonic potentials semi - analytic cubature formulas for the yukawa potential with the approximation rate @xmath22 .",
    "to obtain a tensor product approximation of the second order cubature formula @xmath62 for the harmonic potential with @xmath63 we use the formula obtained in @xcite @xmath64 which is valid for @xmath1 .",
    "the simple quadrature of the integral @xmath65 with certain quadrature weights @xmath66 and nodes @xmath67 gives already a tensor product approximation .",
    "hence , for @xmath5 and @xmath68 @xmath69 which implies that one can approximate @xmath70 @xmath71 .    to obtain a similar tensor product approximation for higher order cubature formula we note that one obtains the same convergence order @xmath22 as in the case of generating functions if the density is approximated by the sum @xmath72 where the generating function is the tensor product of the one - dimensional generating functions @xmath73 and obviously satisfies the moment condition .    to get the one - dimensional integral representation of @xmath74 we use the relation @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the hermite polynomial @xmath77 then the solution of the poisson equation @xmath78 is given by the integral @xmath79 again , a tensor product representation of this integral and consequently of the convolution matrix for the high order cubature of the harmonic potential is given by a quadrature of the last integral .",
    "so the problem is reduced to find efficient quadrature formulas for the parameter dependent integrals @xmath80 more precisely , one has to find a certain quadrature rule with minimal number of summands which approximates the integrals with prescribed error for the parameters @xmath81 within the range @xmath82 and some given bound @xmath83 .",
    "it is well known that classical trapezoidal rule is exponentially converging for certain classes of integrands , for example periodic functions and rapidly decaying functions on the real line .",
    "for example , poisson s summation formula yields that @xmath84 for any sufficiently smooth function , say of the schwarz class @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86 is the fourier transform @xmath87 thus , @xmath88 which indicates that by choosing special substitutions such that the integrand transforms to a rapidly decaying function with rapidly decaying fourier transform , the trapezoidal rule of step size @xmath89 can provide very accurate approximations of the integral .",
    "here we follow a proposal made by j. waldvogel @xcite to compute accurately integrals of analytic functions .",
    "we make the substitutions @xmath90 where @xmath91 are certain constants .",
    "then the integrals are transformed to integrals over @xmath92 of doubly exponentially decaying integrands @xmath93 , i.e. @xmath94 for @xmath95 with certain constants @xmath96 .",
    "it is known ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) that by suitable truncation of the infinite sum in the trapezoidal rule of step size @xmath89 provides exponentially convergent numerical quadrature algorithms with the error estimate @xmath97 .
