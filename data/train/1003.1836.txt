    "persistence concerns the question how long a fluctuating variable stays above a certain level .",
    "it is a recurrent theme in statistical physics .",
    "it started as the problem of level crossing in probability theory @xcite .",
    "if the problem is posed in the context of gaussian random processes , persistence is completely determined by the correlation function of the stochastic variable . for these processes",
    "the essence of the problem is to calculate , from the correlation function , the probability that the fluctuation variable stays above a certain level during the time @xmath3 .",
    "this turned out to be a classic unsolved problem in probability theory @xcite . around the turn of the century the investigations reached a peak , with applications in physics , ranging from properties of the diffusion equation @xcite , survival of spin states @xcite , fluctuating steps @xcite and interfaces @xcite , to persistence in order parameters @xcite and non - gaussian processes @xcite . a recent review on equilibrium step fluctuations , which poses the problem of persistence in a wide context ,",
    "is given by constantin et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the investigations focussed on the calculation the asymptotic behavior .",
    "the associated persistence exponent sometimes characterizes a new partition of physical systems into universality classes . for a stationary gaussian process",
    "the persistence probability for a time @xmath3 decays exponentially with @xmath3 . for these processes",
    "the persistence probability can be written as the ratio of two path integrals .",
    "the numerator involves the sum over paths obeying the condition of persistence and the normalizing denominator over paths without the condition . for a markov process",
    "the correlation function is an exponential and both path integrals can be evaluated .",
    "but as yet there is no general scheme for an arbitrary correlation function to calculate the persistence exponent .",
    "most theoretical investigations treat the process as a continuous process in time , which it certainly is .",
    "however measurements of a stochastic variable are necessarily discrete in time .",
    "one would think that , with a sufficiently high experimental sampling rate , the limit of a continuous process would be seen experimentally , such that the sampling rate would become irrelevant .",
    "this is not obvious though , in particular for `` non - smooth '' processes @xcite .",
    "a `` smooth '' process has a correlation function deviating from its initial value in a quadratic way .",
    "the influence of the discreteness of the sampling on the persistence exponent has been investigated by majumdar et al .",
    "@xcite for stationary gaussian markov processes and by ehrhardt et al .",
    "@xcite for a number of non - markovian smooth processes . in general the exponent derived from discrete sampling is lower than the continuous exponent , because double crossing of the level in between two discrete sampling points are missed .",
    "these authors consider the calculation of the persistence of a discrete sequence more difficult than that of the underlying continuous process , as the approximation schemes derived for continuous processes are not applicable to discrete series of data .",
    "for `` non - smooth '' processes another difficulty arises in the calculation of the persistence probability , because rapid fluctuations give a diverging probability on a short time scale , such that the mean persistence time vanishes @xcite .",
    "recently we encountered the persistence problem in an experimental study of a fluctuating interface between phase - separated colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite .",
    "this is an example of a stationary gaussian random process , since the fluctuations are small in amplitude and their energy is given by a quadratic hamiltonian in the stochastic variables .",
    "on the time scale of the measurements the process is non - markovian and non - smooth .",
    "we have collected data on the correlation function and on the joint probabilities for e.g. finding @xmath0 successive height values above the level @xmath1 .",
    "thus here the practical persistence problem presents itself in a discretized form and the question arises whether one can calculate , from the values of the correlation function , directly the persistence probabilities of the same set of points in time . in an earlier publication @xcite we demonstrated how to do this for short series . in this paper",
    "we extend the calculation to the whole set of experimental points .",
    "we focus here on the longer time sequences which allow for more detail than the similar spatial sequences .",
    "we find the values of the correlation function at equidistant time intervals and also the persistence probability for the same series of time steps .",
    "thus experimental data were obtained in large numbers and high accuracy for an interesting system , which enable to further test the theories on the persistence problem . as mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "the continuum limit usually leads to a simplification of the calculation , but we find in our case the discreteness of the experimental data rather a blessing in disguise . our aim is to show how the persistence probabilities for @xmath0 events can be directly calculated from the measured @xmath2 points of the correlation function for the range of measured points , which are neither on a short time scale nor in a fully asymptotic regime .",
    "we derive two sum rules for the discrete series , which play a vital role in assessing the accuracy of the computational scheme .",
    "traditionally experimental studies of interfaces are carried out by means of light and x - ray scattering .",
    "the field obtained another dimension by experiments of aarts et al .",
    "@xcite , in which they obtained microscopic images of fluctuating interfaces of phase separated colloid - polymer mixtures using confocal microscopy . although scattering on interfaces is most valuable , it always yields _ global _ information on the fluctuations , while inspection by microscopy gives _ local _ information .",
    "however , the wave lengths and heights involved in the capillary waves of molecular fluids are way out of the reach of detection by microscopic methods . for colloidal interfaces the characteristic length and time scale of the fluctuations",
    "can become accessible by confocal microscopy , by lowering the surface tension to the nn / m range .    here , confocal microscopy measurements were performed on phase separated colloid - polymer mixtures .",
    "the colloids are 69 nm radius fluorescently labeled polymethylmetacrylate particles , suspended in cis / trans decalin , with polystyrene ( estimated radius of gyration = 42 nm ) added as depletant polymer . due to a depletion induced attraction these mixtures phase separate at sufficiently high colloid and polymer volume fractions and a proper colloid to polymer aspect ratio , into a colloid - rich / polymer - poor ( colloidal liquid ) and a colloid - poor / polymer - rich ( colloidal gas ) phase @xcite . here",
    "the polymer concentration acts as an inverse temperature and upon dilution the binodal is approached .    in confocal microscopy",
    "a monochromatic laser beam is used to excite dye molecules attached to ( in this case ) the colloid . through a dichroic mirror",
    "the outgoing light is separated from the incoming light . a two - dimensional confocal slice",
    "is then obtained through a pinhole , from single - wavelength fluorescent light emitted from the sample . for our experimental system ,",
    "the confocal slices are only  3 colloidal diameter thick , the density profile between the two phases is observed as a function of fluorescent intensity .    a very precise location of the interface can be obtained by fitting the intensity with a van der waals profile : @xmath4/c)$ ] , where @xmath5 is the direction perpendicular to the interface and @xmath6 a coordinate along the interface . in the upper phase the density approaches a value corresponding to @xmath7 and in the lower phase to @xmath8 , while @xmath9 measures the intrinsic width of the interface .",
    "thus at every snapshot a function @xmath10 follows and the sequence of snapshots gives the function @xmath11 .",
    "it is a practical separation of the particle motions , which lead at short scales to the _ intrinsic interface _ and the particle motions ( _ capillary waves _ ) which drive the long wavelengths .",
    "this opens up the possibility to follow in detail the motion of the height of the interface and to make a statistical analysis of its temporal behavior .",
    "of course the method has its inherent restrictions . just as in ordinary movie recording",
    ", snapshots have to be taken at a finite time intervals . for colloidal interfaces",
    "this interval can be made much smaller than the intrinsic time scale of the motions .    with a nikon e400 microscope equipped with a nikon c1 confocal scanhead , series of 5000 snapshots of the interface",
    "were recorded at constant intervals @xmath12 of 0.45 s and 0.50 s of two statepoints to be denoted as ii and iv .",
    "the latter is closer to the binodal .",
    "the pixels are separated by a distance @xmath13 and a single scan takes approximately 0.25 s to complete . with 640 heights per snapshot ,",
    "we obtain in total @xmath14 data points , which enable us to measure persistence probabilities as low as @xmath15 .",
    "we write the normalized correlation function as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the equal time correlation function .",
    "@xmath18 is the characteristic time of the process which we have inserted in the argument of @xmath19 to make it dimensionless .",
    "it is given by the expression @xmath20 where the @xmath21 s are the viscosities of the two coexisting phases , @xmath22 the density difference and @xmath23 the surface tension . from the definition",
    "follows that @xmath24 .",
    "heights are scaled with @xmath25 and times with @xmath18 , such we can work exclusively with dimensionless quantities .",
    "experimentally one has a discrete sampling of @xmath26 with @xmath12 as smallest interval .",
    "thus one finds a sequence @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "capillary wave theory for overdamped waves gives the following expression for the correlation function @xcite .",
    "@xmath29}{1 + x^2}.\\ ] ] the upper bound of the integral is @xmath30 with @xmath31 the correlation length and @xmath32 the diameter of the particles . the lower bound , determined by the size of the system , has been set equal to 0 .",
    "the upper bound is essential for the convergence of the integral and of influence on the short time behavior of the correlation function .",
    "cutting off the capillary waves at the short - wavelength side is the poor man s way to handle the otherwise diverging interface width @xmath17 .",
    "[ height ] shows the function ( [ a3 ] ) together with data points referring to two experiments , denoted by ii and iv @xcite .",
    "the choice of @xmath33 is actually a fit of @xmath18 .",
    "so we have plotted in the figure the data points with @xmath34 and @xmath35 for ii and @xmath36 for iv .    =    although the data points follow the curve reasonably well , the scatter of the data points is manifest and more important , though only visible in the insert , is the fact that the first few points are well below the curve . in this paper",
    "it is of less importance how well the experimental correlation function can be represented by a theoretical curve , since we are interested in the problem to directly calculate the persistence probabilities from the experimental correlation function .",
    "to formulate the persistence probability for a discrete series , we form the @xmath37 matrix @xmath38 , which is determined by the first @xmath0 values of @xmath39 . using that the process is gaussian , the probability on a sequence of values @xmath40 is given by the formula @xmath41 with the normalization @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the determinant of @xmath19",
    "@xmath44 is the inverse of @xmath45 , which is again a @xmath37 matrix and its matrix elements also individually depend on @xmath0 ( while those of @xmath19 only depend on @xmath46 ) .",
    "the justification of ( [ a4 ] ) is based on the fact that the correlator @xmath47 as calculated with ( [ a4 ] ) leads indeed to @xmath48 .",
    "the expression for the persistence probability @xmath49 , on a sequence of _ precisely _ @xmath0 events above @xmath1 , follows as the ratio of two integrals @xmath50 the numerator is the @xmath51-fold integral @xmath52 where the integration domain @xmath53 , indicated by the superscript on @xmath54 , is given by the conditions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it selects the sequence of events : starting with a value below @xmath1 , followed by @xmath0 points above @xmath1 and terminated by a value below @xmath1 , which are the sequences of precisely @xmath0 successive values of the height @xmath57 .",
    "similarly the denominator is given by the double integral @xmath58 the inverse matrix @xmath44 depends for @xmath59 only on the first value @xmath60 of the correlation function .",
    "so the @xmath61 is generally given by @xmath62 \\over [ 2 \\pi ( 1-g^2_1)]^{1/2}}\\ ] ] the denominator serves as normalization , since one has the relation @xmath63 which gives the sum rule for the total probability @xmath64 the derivation of ( [ a7a ] ) is based on repeated expansion of the relation @xmath65 which simply states that the probability to find a sequence @xmath66 is the same as finding it from the events @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "together they extend the integration over the last height variable over all values and the probability on @xmath66 results . repeatedly adding a new point in the sequence ending with @xmath69 leads to the identity ( [ a7a ] ) .",
    "there exist one other sum rule .",
    "consider @xmath70 , which is the single integral over @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "the expansion , similar to ( [ a8 ] ) starts as @xmath73 systematically replacing every @xmath69 at the begin or end of the string by the sum of strings extended with a @xmath69 and @xmath74 gives @xmath75 this yields for the mean value the sum rule @xmath76 we have not found further sum rules .    the sum rules ( [ a9 ] ) and ( [ a11 ] ) , which generally apply for stationary gaussian processes , involve doable integrals .",
    "@xmath77 is an error function and @xmath78 can be reduced from the double integral ( [ a7b ] ) to a single integral , for which an analytic expression exist for @xmath79 @xcite @xmath80 the sum rules are typical for the discrete series as the continuum limit for non - smooth processes is singular .",
    "if one could straightforwardly define in the continuum limit a probability density @xmath81 on a persistence interval @xmath3 , one would expect that it would be related to the discrete @xmath82 as @xmath83 where we suppressed the @xmath1 dependence for the moment .",
    "the probability density is then normalized @xmath84 consequently one would expect the mean of the discrete series to diverge as @xmath85 however the expression ( [ a12 ] ) shows , with @xmath86 , that @xmath87 while @xmath88 is independent of @xmath12 .",
    "so the discrete mean diverges as @xmath89 in contrast to the expected behavior ( [ a15 ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the brownian fluctuations on all length scales for a non - smooth correlation function@xcite .",
    "this gives a non - integrable probability density for short times , making the normalization ( [ a14 ] ) questionable .",
    "we calculate the @xmath49 and then check whether total and mean corresponds with the exactly calculable ratios . in particular ( [ a11 ] ) is a stringent test on the the calculated values of @xmath49 , since it more sensitive to the large @xmath0 values than ( @xmath90 .",
    "the restricted integration domain prevents the integral ( [ a6 ] ) from straightforward evaluation .",
    "although it involves a finite set of integrations , which indeed can be performed by standard techniques for small @xmath0 , a direct evaluation of ( [ a6 ] ) is impossible for large @xmath0",
    ". as we shall show , expression ( [ a6 ] ) has a definite asymptotic large @xmath0 behavior , but the experimental data are not at all exclusively determined by this asymptotic behavior .",
    "in fact , the practical regime for which accurate data can be collected , shows important transient behavior .",
    "our calculational scheme is inspired by the perturbation technique of majumdar and sire @xcite , which takes the markovian case as lowest approximation .",
    "the markovian case has an exponential decaying correlator @xmath91 such that @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "the inverse matrix @xmath94 is then a band matrix with all elements 0 except on the diagonal : @xmath95 note that this also holds for a matrix of finite dimension @xmath0 .",
    "if the matrix @xmath94 is restricted to the diagonal and the subdiagonals , the corresponding joint probability can be factorized in several ways .",
    "we present here the symmetric representation for the above markovian case @xmath96 the initial ( and final ) function is given by @xmath97 / [ 2 \\pi]^{1/2}\\ ] ] with @xmath98 .",
    "the kernel reads @xmath99 } { [ 2 \\pi ( 1-g^2)]^{1/2}},\\ ] ] with the values @xmath100 physically , the factorization results from the fact that in a markovian process the probability on an event only depends on the probability of the previous event . mathematically , any matrix which is restricted to the diagonal and the subdiagonals , can be seen as a markovian matrix .",
    "we use the more convenient symmetric form , allowed by time reversal symmetry , rather than the standard conditional probability , with an asymmetric kernel .",
    "we will lean heavily on choosing the optimal markovian approximation , which uses optimal values for the @xmath101 and @xmath102 and not those tied in with @xmath19 .",
    "any of these representations give the values of @xmath49 recursively .",
    "define a set of functions @xmath103 with @xmath104 given by ( [ b4 ] ) .",
    "@xmath105 is constructed from @xmath106 as @xmath107 the general term is defined by recursion for @xmath108 @xmath109 then @xmath49 can be expressed as @xmath110 in the markovian case the multiple integral ( [ a6 ] ) becomes a repeated integral transformation with @xmath111 as kernel .",
    "asymptotically the result is dominated by the largest eigenvalue of the kernel , which then leads to a persistence exponent .",
    "our approximation scheme is based on a separation of @xmath94 in a markovian part @xmath112 and a remainder @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 is a markovian approximant , i.e. a matrix which is confined to the diagonal and the subdiagonals .",
    "thus one can relate a kernel @xmath111 to @xmath115 as in ( [ b3 ] ) , but with as yet unspecified values of @xmath116 and @xmath102 . also a markovian joint probability @xmath112 can be associated with this part ( as in ( [ b3 ] ) , which enables to define a markovian approximation @xmath117 @xmath118 with @xmath119 the same integration domain as in ( [ a6 ] ) .",
    "the full probability @xmath49 then reads @xmath120 where the average @xmath121 is defined as @xmath122 the exponential in ( [ c3 ] ) will be evaluated by the cumulant expansion .",
    "the markovian average of the first cumulant of @xmath123 as well as the higher cumulants are calculated in a similar iterative way as @xmath117 .",
    "there is a large freedom in choosing the markovian part .",
    "any matrix with only a non - zero diagonal and subdiagonals would do .",
    "this freedom can be exploited through the inequality @xmath124 the optimal markovian matrix gives the largest value for the right - hand side .",
    "the calculation thus consists of finding an optimal markovian approximation and evaluating the corrections . for the convergence of the calculational scheme",
    "the optimization is crucial . as optimization parameters we can use @xmath125 and for each kernel a choice for @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the practical optimization is a trade - off between the optimum and calculational simplicity .",
    "it is expedient to have all kernels the same , with the exception of the first and last .",
    "they have anyway a different role , carrying the system from below @xmath1 to above @xmath1 , while the other progagators keep the system above @xmath1 .",
    "so we remain with an initial ( and final ) @xmath125 , the first ( and last ) pair @xmath126 and the bulk pair @xmath127 .",
    "a further restriction stems from the chosen integration procedure .",
    "the integrals can be fast and accurately evaluated using gaussian quadrature , with a gaussian as weight factor .",
    "the initial @xmath128 is a gaussian . requiring that after an iteration the asymptotic behavior is still the same gaussian , @xmath127 and @xmath125 have to be related as @xmath129 .",
    "a constant gaussian allows to use the same positions and weights in the gaussian quadrature for each iteration .",
    "this reduces the freedom from 5 to 3 parameters : @xmath130 and @xmath102 .",
    "thus our calculational scheme starts out by finding for every @xmath0 the optimal values of the parameters @xmath130 and @xmath102 . according to the inequality ( [ c5 ] )",
    "this gives persistence probabilities @xmath131 which are too low .",
    "consequently the total persistence and the mean as calculated with this approximation will be lower than the exact values calculated from the sum rules ( [ a9 ] ) and ( [ a11 ] ) . using the the gaussian quadrature",
    "this is a fast routine .",
    "the next step is the calculation of the second cumulant , which leads to an overestimation of the persistence probability . thus including the second cumulant the sum rules are approached from above .",
    "as the second cumulant requires to calculate many correlation functions ( going up with @xmath132 ) this becomes already a longer calculation .",
    "it takes about an hour on a simple pc to calculate persistence probabilities up to @xmath133 .",
    "needless to say that the computation of the third cumulant , where the number of correlation functions goes up as @xmath134 , is even more time consuming . in practice we could calculate the third cumulant up to @xmath135 in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "fortunately the changes in the persistence probabilities due to the inclusion of the third cumulant are so small that they do not influence the value of the sum rules .",
    "before we carry out the computation of the persistence probabilities of the actual data , we inspect a clean case by taking the correlations points @xmath39 from the analytic expression ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "this has the advantage of noise - free input and allows to vary the sampling rate @xmath33 .",
    "the test consists out of the calculation of the sum rules with the cumulant expansion outlined in the previous section .",
    "we consider two samplings of the curve ( [ a3 ] ) , @xmath35 and twice as narrow @xmath36 , which correspond closely to the experiments ii viz .",
    "iv @xcite ) .",
    "we take @xmath136 in both cases .",
    "[ test ]    .sum rules for the testcurve ; cumulants and exact value . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ exper ]    =    the entry `` exact '' refers to the calculation of the sums using ( [ a9 ] ) and ( [ a11 ] ) , which requires only the value of @xmath60 .",
    "the marks around `` exact '' refer to the uncertainties in @xmath60 determining the ratios , which is not correlated to the uncertainty in the other @xmath39 , together determining the persistence probabilities .",
    "the sums for statepoint ii are based on 100 points , which is about the number of reliable values of @xmath39 .",
    "the sums of state point iv are extended to 150 points . in both cases",
    "the value of @xmath137 is then so small that inclusion of further points will not change the sums",
    ". the lower bound is considerably less accurate than for the generated @xmath39 .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "the above mentioned scatter in the data adds to the non - markovian character .",
    "even if the process were strictly markovian , the noise would be seen as a deviation from markovian behavior and would lead to a convergence question .",
    "the second reason is that the measured @xmath60 is quite low : @xmath138 ( ii ) and @xmath139 ( iv ) .",
    "we noticed already that less `` smooth '' processes have a slower convergence .",
    "however the second cumulant approaches nicely the correct values , indicating that these calculated persistence probabilities are accurate .",
    "the real challenge is to see how well the persistence probabilities calculated from the measured correlation points compare with measured probabilities .",
    "this is shown fig .",
    "[ persis ] for the two state points ( with @xmath79 ) .",
    "the calculated points are taken from the second cumulant approximation , since the third cumulant has no appreciable influence .",
    "the agreement for state point iv is as good as one can hope for probabilities as small as @xmath140 . for state point ii",
    "there is a systematic deviation for larger @xmath0 .",
    "this may be caused by artifacts resulting from the confocal slicing .",
    "@xmath17 and therefore the resolution relative to @xmath17 are higher for iv than for ii , leading to more pronounced artifacts in ii @xcite .",
    "note that the asymptotic exponential decay sets in around @xmath141 which takes as long as @xmath142 in real time .",
    "we have presented measurements for the correlation function and the persistence probability of the fluctuating heights of a colloidal interface .",
    "we have developed a calculational scheme which enables to find the persistence probability directly from the measured correlation function .",
    "this means that our scheme is independent of the agreement of the correlation function to a function like ( [ a3 ] ) .",
    "the only assumption is that the distribution ( [ a4 ] ) is gaussian , which stems from the fact that the thermal interface fluctuations are small deviations from equilibrium .",
    "the predictions of the persistence probabilities from the measured correlation function agree very well with the measured persistence probabilities .",
    "1 .   fig .",
    "[ persis ] shows that the curve approaches an exponential decay , albeit that a window from 30 - 100 points is not large for an accurate determination of the exponent .",
    "as we mentioned the two experiments may be seen as two samplings of the same correlation function . in order to compare the two samplings we translate the behavior to the time domain .",
    "for the two samplings we estimate the decay of @xmath143 .",
    "since @xmath144 , the persistence exponent @xmath145 equals @xmath146 . for the smallest @xmath33 we find @xmath147 and for the larger @xmath33 , @xmath148 .",
    "these two values need not be the same . as observed by ehrhardt et al .",
    "@xcite , the exponent for non - smooth processes is quite sensitive to the sampling rate .",
    "the discrete series does not record what happens _ in between _ the measured points .",
    "the continuous process might dive below the level @xmath1 between recorded points .",
    "such paths are excluded in a continuous formulation , but are included in the discrete version @xcite .",
    "this leads to a smaller exponent for a larger @xmath33 .",
    "we note that we can not take the continuum limit for practical and essential reasons .",
    "making our @xmath33 smaller requires longer series to calculate as the two samplings show . but more importantly , a smaller @xmath33 will lead to a sharper peaked kernel , which ultimately has to approach a @xmath33-function .",
    "such a delta peak can not be treated by gaussian quadrature , which has helped to speed up the integrations by about a factor thousand with respect to e.g. a simpson rule .",
    "we have checked that higher cumulants have virtually no influence on the persistence probabilities calculated here .",
    "we noticed , however , that although the third cumulant is small , it develops a linear dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "it has no influence on the presented sum - rule results nor on the presented persistence probabilities , since it changes only the probabilities which are already too small to contribute .",
    "but it will have a non - negligible influence on the decay exponent of the discrete series , showing up in a region which is beyond our measurements .",
    "this also means that the experiments have not entered the fully developed asymptotic regime ."
