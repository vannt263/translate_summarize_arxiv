    "we have been studying a particular kind of collaborative dialogue in which two participants ( a consultant and an executing agent ) collaborate on developing a plan to achieve the executing agent s domain goal . in such an environment , the consultant and the executing agent have different knowledge about the domain and about the executing agent s particular circumstances and preferences that may affect the domain plan being constructed .",
    "thus , it is inevitable that an agent will not always immediately accept the actions or beliefs proposed by the other agent .",
    "however , an agent should recognize the collaborative nature of the interaction and the fact that each agent has private knowledge that is not shared by the other agent .",
    "thus , rather than indiscriminately rejecting proposals that she does not have sufficient reasons to accept , a collaborative agent should both share her private knowledge with the other agent and solicit relevant information from the other agent in order for both agents to effectively re - evaluate the proposal and come to the most beneficial decision .",
    "such collaborative information - sharing behaviour is illustrated in the following dialogue segment based on transcripts of naturally occuring dialogues @xcite . in this dialogue , a travel agent ( t ) and a customer ( c ) are constructing a plan for two other agents to travel from san francisco to los angeles .",
    "this segment follows a proposal that the travelers be booked on a particular usair flight .    _",
    "_    [ american ] can we put them on american ?",
    "[ why ] why ?",
    "we re having a lot of problems on the usair seat maps so i do nt know if i can get them together .",
    "but american whatever we request pretty much we get .",
    "i do nt know if they care if they sit together .",
    "[ usair ] let s go ahead and stick with usair .    in this dialogue",
    ", t proposes putting the travelers on american airlines instead of usair in utterance ( [ american ] ) . in ( [ why ] ) ,",
    "c questions t s motivation for this proposed action  i.e. , the support that t s private knowledge provides for this proposal .",
    "after t provides her motivation , c informs t in ( [ care ] ) that she rejects the motivation , re - evaluates the proposal , and in ( [ usair ] ) rejects the actions proposed by t.    this paper presents a computational model for collaborative information - sharing during proposal evaluation .",
    "our model first uses the system s existing beliefs along with evidence provided by the user to evaluate user proposals and to determine whether they should be accepted or rejected .",
    "if the system has insufficient information to make this decision , it initiates an information - sharing subdialogue to form a set of shared beliefs within which the agents can effectively re - evaluate the proposal and come to agreement .",
    "this may lead to evaluation of an agent s reasons for a proposal and further information - sharing about an agent s beliefs supporting these reasons , thus leading to an embedded information - sharing subdialogue .",
    "our research contributes to response generation in collaborative interaction by 1 ) providing an algorithm for identifying when an information - sharing subdialogue should be initiated during proposal evaluation , 2 ) providing a selection algorithm for determining the beliefs that should be the focus of information - sharing , 3 ) formulating information - sharing strategies and identifying the criteria for invoking each strategy , and 4 ) capturing the process in a _ propose - evaluate - modify _ cycle that enables embedded information - sharing subdialogues .",
    "in modeling collaborative activities , it is essential that the system captures the agents intentions conveyed by their utterances .",
    "our model utilizes an enhanced version of the dialogue model described in @xcite to represent the current status of the interaction .",
    "the enhanced dialogue model has four levels : the _ domain _ level which consists of the domain plan being constructed for later execution , the _ problem - solving _ level which contains the actions being performed to construct the domain plan , the _ belief _ level which consists of the mutual beliefs pursued to further the problem - solving intentions , and the _ discourse _ level which contains the communicative actions initiated to achieve the mutual beliefs @xcite .    in our earlier work , we developed a plan - based model that captures collaborative planning in a _ propose - evaluate - modify _ cycle of actions @xcite .",
    "this model treats a collaborative planning process as a sequence of the following actions : agent a s _ proposal _ of a set of actions and beliefs to be added to the _ shared plan _",
    "@xcite being developed , agent b s _ evaluation _ of the proposed actions and beliefs , and b s proposed _",
    "modifications _ to the original proposal in cases where the proposal is rejected .",
    "notice that b s proposed modifications will again be evaluated by a , and if conflicts arise , a may propose modifications to b s proposed modifications , resulting in a recursive process .    however , our previous research assumed that an agent s evaluation of a proposal always results in the proposal being accepted or rejected , and did not take into account cases in which the agent initially has insufficient information to determine whether or not to accept the proposal , as shown in the example in utterances ( [ american])-([usair ] ) .",
    "this paper extends our earlier work by providing a computational strategy for collaborative information - sharing during proposal evaluation .",
    "we focus on situations in which the system s lack of knowledge occurs during the evaluation of proposals at the belief level of the dialogue model .",
    "since a collaborative agent initiates information - sharing subdialogues to help determine whether to accept or reject a proposed belief , the information - sharing process is captured as part of the _ evaluation _ process in the _ propose - evaluate - modify _",
    "cycle for collaborative activities .",
    "thus the evaluation of a proposed belief involves the agent 1 ) determining the acceptance of the proposed belief based on the information currently available to her , and 2 ) in cases where she can not decide whether to accept or reject the belief , initiating an information - sharing subdialogue so that the agents can exchange information and re - evaluate the proposed belief .",
    "the following sections describe these two processes .",
    "our system maintains a set of beliefs about the domain and about the user s beliefs .",
    "associated with each belief is a _ strength _ that represents the agent s confidence in holding the belief .",

    "else if upperbound = lowerbound = reject , reject _ bel .",
    "else unsure about _ bel ; annotate _ bel with upperbound , lowerbound , evidence set , and potential evidence set .    ' '' ''    the belief level of our dialogue model consists of one or more belief trees where the belief represented by a child node is intended to support that represented by its parent .",
    "when an agent proposes a new belief and gives ( optional ) supporting evidence for it , this set of proposed beliefs is represented as a belief tree .",
    "the system must then evaluate the proposed beliefs in order to determine whether to accept the proposal , reject it , or pursue information - sharing to allow the agents to re - evaluate it . the algorithm for evaluating proposed beliefs",
    "is shown in figure  [ evaluate_algo ] , and is applied to the root node of each proposed belief tree ( the top - level proposed beliefs ) . since the acceptance of a child belief may affect the acceptance of its parent , before determining the acceptance of a belief or evidential relationship , its children in the proposed belief tree must be evaluated ( step 3 ) .",
    "thus , for each child belief of _ bel , the system evaluates both the belief ( step 3.1 ) and the evidential relationship between the belief and _ bel ( step 3.2 ) . a piece of evidence is marked as 1 ) accepted",
    "if both the child belief and the evidential relationship are accepted , 2 ) rejected if either the child belief or the evidential relationship is rejected , and 3 ) uncertain otherwise .    to determine the status ( accepted , rejected , or uncertain ) of a belief _ bel ,",
    "the algorithm constructs an _ evidence set _ that contains the user s proposal of _ bel , endorsed according to the user s level of expertise in that subarea as well as the user s strength in the belief as conveyed by the semantic form of the utterance ( step 1 ) , the system s own beliefs pertaining to _ bel ( step 1 ) , and evidence proposed by the user that is accepted by the system ( step 3.4 ) .",
    "it also constructs a _",
    "potential evidence set _ consisting of evidence proposed by the user whose acceptance is undetermined ( step 3.5 ) .",
    "the algorithm must then determine whether the potential evidence could have an impact on the system s decision - making .",
    "it first evaluates _",
    "bel by invoking the * evaluate * function to compute an upperbound and a lowerbound for the system s acceptance of _ bel .",
    "the upperbound is computed by invoking the * evaluate * function with evidence from both the evidence set and the potential evidence set , i.e. , treating all uncertain evidence as accepted , and the lowerbound is computed by invoking * evaluate * with only the evidence set , i.e. , treating all uncertain evidence as rejected ( steps 4.1 and 4.2 ) . if _",
    "bel is either accepted or rejected in both cases , indicating that the uncertainty of the evidence , if any , does not affect the acceptance of _ bel , the system accepts or rejects _ bel ( steps 4.3 and 4.4 ) . otherwise , the system has insufficient information to determine the acceptance of _ bel and it is marked as uncertain ( step 4.5 ) . if the top - level proposed belief is marked as uncertain , an information - sharing subdialogue will be initiated , as described in the next section .      a collaborative agent ,",
    "when facing a situation in which she is uncertain about whether to accept a proposal , should attempt to share information with the other agent so that each agent can knowledgably re - evaluate the proposal and the agents can come to agreement  to do otherwise is to fail in her responsibilities as a collaborative agent .",
    "furthermore , a collaborative agent should engage in effective and efficient dialogues ; thus she should pursue the information - sharing subdialogue that she believes will most likely result in the agents coming to an intelligent decision about the proposal .",
    "the process for initiating information - sharing subdialogues involves two steps : selecting a focus of information - sharing from the proposed beliefs marked as uncertain during the initial evaluation process , and selecting an effective information - sharing strategy .",
    "the possible combinations of the upperbound and lowerbound values produced by the * evaluate - belief * algorithm ( figure  [ evaluate_algo ] ) are shown in figure  [ combination ] .",
    "cases 1 and 6 correspond to steps 4.3 and 4.4 in figure  [ evaluate_algo ] , respectively , in which the decision to accept or reject is the same whether or not beliefs in the potential evidence set are accepted . in these cases , the uncertainty in the child beliefs need not be resolved since their acceptance will not impact acceptance of the parent belief that they are intended to support , and thus will not affect acceptance of the top - level proposed belief that is important to the plan being constructed . in case 4",
    ", the system will remain unsure whether to accept or reject _ bel regardless of whether the uncertain child beliefs , if any , are accepted or rejected , i.e. , resolving the uncertainty in the child beliefs will not help resolve the uncertainty in _ bel .",
    "thus , the system should focus on sharing information to resolve the uncertainty about _ bel itself instead of its children . in cases 2 and 3 ,",
    "acceptance of the child beliefs has the potential to influence acceptance of _ bel and in cases 3 and 5 , rejection of the child beliefs can lead to rejection of _ bel .",
    "thus in all three cases , the system should initiate information - sharing that will allow the agents to come to agreement about the currently uncertain child beliefs .",

' '' ''    = -1000 however , there may be more than one uncertain child belief .",
    "thus when the system initiates information - sharing , it must first select a belief on which to focus during the information - sharing process .",
    "our algorithm for selecting the focus of information - sharing is shown in figure  [ focus_algo ] .",
    "* select - focus - info - sharing * is initially invoked with _",
    "bel instantiated as the top - level proposed belief .",
    "step  [ both_uncertain ] of the algorithm corresponds to case 4 in figure  [ combination ] where the uncertainty in the child beliefs is irrelevant to the acceptance of _ bel ; thus the focus of information - sharing is _ bel itself .",
    "steps  [ upper ] and [ lower ] of the algorithm correspond to cases 2 , 3 and 5 in figure  [ combination ] where the system attempts to share information to resolve the uncertainty in the child beliefs and perhaps thereby accept or reject _ bel .",
    "step  [ upper ] of the algorithm is concerned with cases where the potential acceptance of uncertain child beliefs may lead to the acceptance of _ bel ( cases 2 and 3 in figure  [ combination ] ) . in selecting the focus of information - sharing in such cases",
    ", two factors should come into play : 1 ) how strongly the acceptance of each piece of evidence affects the acceptance of _ bel  the stronger the impact that the potential evidence can have on the acceptance of _ bel , the more useful it is to expend effort on resolving the uncertainty about the proposed evidence , and 2 ) how close each piece of evidence was to being accepted during the initial evaluation process  the closer a piece of evidence is to being accepted , the easier it is for the system to gather sufficient information to accept the evidence .",
    "our algorithm first constructs a singleton set for each piece of uncertain evidence for _ bel , where a piece of evidence includes a pair of beliefs : a child belief,@xmath7 , and the evidential relationship between _ bel@xmath3 and _ bel , _ supports(_bel@xmath3,_bel)_. the sets are ordered according to how close the beliefs in a set were to being accepted in the initial evaluation process ( step  [ rank ] ) . the first set ( _ set@xmath1 )",
    "is then added to the evidence set , and _ bel is re - evaluated with respect to the augmented evidence set ( step  [ predict ] ) , thus considering the potential effect of the acceptance of beliefs in _",
    "set@xmath1 on the acceptance of _ bel .",
    "if the result of the evaluation is to accept _ bel , indicating that resolving the uncertainty of the beliefs in _ set@xmath1 is sufficient to resolve the uncertainty of _ bel , then * select - focus - info - sharing * is recursively applied to each belief in _ set@xmath1 in order to determine the focus for resolving the uncertainty of beliefs in _ set@xmath1 ( step  [ succeed ] ) . on the other hand , if the evaluation indicates that accepting _ set@xmath1 does not result in the acceptance of _ bel , the next set ( _ set@xmath8 ) is tried .",
    "this continues until either the uncertain evidence in a set is predicted to resolve the uncertainty of _ bel , or all of the uncertain evidence is tried and none suffices for acceptance of _ bel . in the latter case , the set size is increased by one , sets of the requisite size are constructed by combining individual pieces of evidence , the new sets are ordered , and the same process is repeated ( step  [ fail ] ) .",
    "thus our algorithm guarantees that the fewest possible beliefs are selected as the focus of information - sharing and that these beliefs require the least effort to achieve among those that are strong enough to affect the acceptance of _ bel .",
    "step  [ lower ] of the algorithm corresponds to cases 3 and 5 in figure  [ combination ] .",
    "the procedure for step  [ lower ] is similar to that for step  [ upper ] except that in predicting the effect of resolving a piece of uncertain evidence , _ bel is evaluated under the assumption that the set of uncertain evidence under consideration is rejected while the other uncertain beliefs are accepted ( step 5.2 ) .",
    "we have identified four strategies which a collaborative agent may adopt in initiating an information - sharing subdialogue to allow the agents to share information and re - evaluate a belief or evidential relationship , _ bel :    [ strategies ]    1 .",
    "agent a may present a piece of evidence against _ bel and ( implicitly ) invite agent b to attack it .",
    "such a strategy focuses b s attention on the counterevidence and suggests that it is what keeps a from accepting _ bel .",
    "thus in collaborative activities , this strategy should only be employed if a s counterevidence is _ critical _ , i.e. , if proving that the counterevidence is invalid will cause a to accept _ bel .",
    "this strategy also allows the possibility of b accepting the counterevidence and perhaps both agents subsequently adopting @xmath9_bel instead of _ bel .",
    "2 .   agent a may query b about his reasons for believing in _ bel .",
    "this strategy is appropriate when a does not know b s support for _ bel , and also does not have evidence against _ bel herself .",
    "it would result either in a gathering evidence that contributes toward her adopting _ bel , or in a discovering b s invalid justification for holding _ bel and attempting to convince b of @xmath9_bel .",
    "3 .   agent a may query b for his evidence for _ bel and also present her reasons for believing in @xmath9_bel .",
    "this strategy is adopted when a does not know b s reasons for believing _ bel , but does have non - critical evidence against accepting _ bel . in this case",
    "b may provide his support for _ bel , attack a s evidence against _ bel , or accept a s counterevidence and perhaps subsequently adopt @xmath9_bel .",
    "4 .   agent a may indicate her uncertainty about _ bel and present her reasons against _ bel .",
    "this strategy is adopted when a is least certain about how to go about sharing information to resolve the uncertainty  when a already knows b s reasons for believing _ bel , and only has non - critical evidence against accepting _ bel . in a collaborative environment ,",
    "a s indication of the uncertainty in her decision should lead b to provide information that he believes will help a re - evaluate the proposal .",
    "the process for initiating information - sharing subdialogues is performed by invoking the _ share - info - reevaluate - belief _ problem - solving action on the focus identified by * select - focus - info - sharing * ( figure  [ focus_algo ] ) .",
