    "the neutral pion transition form factor is measured through electron - positron scattering .",
    "although the available data of cello @xcite , cleo @xcite , babar @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations agree in the domain of @xmath3 gev@xmath4 , the babar and belle data ( the only data available above that point ) are notoriously different . moreover , how possibly the babar data can reconcile with the asymptotic qcd limit , calculated by brodsky and lepage in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath2 , remains unclear and unsatisfactory .",
    "+   + we have previous dse input from @xcite , but because of the numerical methods developed by that time , it was not possible to arrive at momentum scales larger than @xmath5 gev@xmath4 .",
    "complete understanding of @xmath1 demands simultaneously achieving correct asymptotic behavior , but also the essentially non perturbative abelian anomaly , @xmath6 .",
    "such features are achievable in the framework of dses . at the same time",
    ", we are able to connect our results with that of the pion s pda , @xcite , and elastic electromagnetic form factor , @xcite .",
    "the reference to our detailed published article is @xcite .",
    "most of the ingredients which have gone into this study are quite general and can be applied to other mesons and processes . in particular , the study of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is under way .",
    "for any pseudoscalar meson ( @xmath9 ) , the @xmath10 is expressed through @xmath11 , where the matrix element is : @xmath12 the photons momenta are @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the meson s total momentum is @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) . at leading order ( rainbow - ladder truncation ) in the systematic and symmetry preserving dse truncation scheme",
    ", one can write : @xmath17 here",
    "@xmath18 is the quark charge operator ( @xmath19 $ ] for neutral pion ) , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where the kinematic constraints are : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath16 .",
    "the quark propagator , @xmath25 , and the bethe - salpeter amplitude ( bsa ) , @xmath26 , are obtained by solving the corresponding dses and the bses . on the other hand ,",
    "the quark - photon vertex is constructed via the _ gauge technique _ ,",
    "we give the details in the following subsections .",
    "most generally , the quark propagator is written as @xmath27 , while the bsa is : @xmath28\\;,\\ ] ] the corresponding dse and bse , in the rainbow - ladder truncation , are : @xmath29 with @xmath30 being the effective coupling described in @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : dserainbow ] ) , we can parameterize it in the form of a complex conjugate pole representation : @xmath31 constrained to the ultraviolet conditions of free quark propagator ; @xmath32 is accurate enough for our purposes .",
    "we then solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : dseladder ] ) , and parameterize its solutions with the perturbation theory integral representation ( ptir ) : @xmath33\\;,\\\\ \\nonumber e^u(k;p)&= & c_{e}^u \\int_{-1}^1 dz \\ ; \\rho_{\\nu^u_e}(z ) \\hat{\\delta}^{1+\\alpha}_{\\lambda_e^u}(k_z^2 ) \\;,\\\\",

    "the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are fitted to the numerical data ; @xmath45 simulates the logarithmic uv behavior , characteristic of qcd , and @xmath46 defines the spectral density @xmath47 the amplitude @xmath48 has only a very small impact on the final results and can safely be neglected .",
    "such representations have a quadratic form in the denominator , which will be practically useful in the computation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tffeq ] ) .",
    "ptirs are not available yet for the quark - photon vertex .",
    "instead , we use the following _ ansatz _ for the unamputated vertex : @xmath49\\delta_{\\sigma_v}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & [ s(\\gamma\\cdot k_f \\gamma_\\mu + \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma \\cdot k_i)+\\bar{s}(\\gamma\\cdot k_i \\gamma_\\mu + \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma \\cdot k_f)]i\\delta_{\\sigma_s}\\ ; , \\label{eq : vertexansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50/[k_f^2-k_i^2]$ ] , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this vertex _ ansatz _ is obtained using the _ gauge technique_. by construction , it satisfies the longitudinal ward - green - takahashi identity , is free of kinematic singularities , reduces to the bare vertex in the free - field limit , and has the same poincar transformations properties as the bare vertex . +   + up to transverse pieces associated with the scalar @xmath53 , @xmath54 is equivalent to @xmath55 .",
    "nothing material would be gained herein by making them identical because any difference is power - law suppressed in the ultraviolet ; but computational effort would increase substantially .",
    "we define @xmath53 as follows : @xmath56\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the _ breit - frame _ energy of the pseudoscalar and , @xmath58 is the euclidian constituent - quark mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 has to do with the value of @xmath1 in a neighborhood of @xmath60 . in the case of the pion ,",
    "owing to the abelian anomaly , it is impossible to simultaneously conserve the vector and axial vector currents associated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : tffeq ] ) , but , with a proper choice of @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdef ] ) , vector currents are conserved and the abelian anomaly is satisfied . with everything expressed in terms the same functions , we will now see how the appropriate parameterizations of @xmath62 and @xmath63 allow us to compute @xmath1 in the whole range of space - like momenta .",
    "all elements of eq . ( [ eq : tffeq ] ) are written in terms of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , expressed as complex conjugate pole representation or ptirs , respectively .",
    "computation of @xmath1 reduces to the task of summing a series of terms , all of which involve a single four - momentum integral .",
    "+   + as we saw before , our quark - photon vertex construction allow us to satisfy one of the constraints of the transition form factor , namely , the conservation of vector current ( ensuring the abelian anomaly is correctly recovered for the pion ) . in other words , this constraint fixes the value of @xmath64 .",
    "one should also understand the connection of @xmath1 with the meson s pda and its evolution with the factorization scale of qcd .",
    "as the same pda also governs the @xmath65 dependence of the pion electromagnetic form factor , we will have a unified prediction of both the form factors in the asymptotic limit of qcd .",
    "we detailed the algorithm below .      because of the representations employed for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the denominator in every term is a product of @xmath66-quadratic forms .",
    "we perform feynman parameterization . after a proper change of variables ,",
    "all the momentum integrals can be solved analytically .",
    "once we solved the four - momentum integrals , one computes a finite number of simple integrals , namely , the ones over the feynman parameters and @xmath67 , the spectral integral . the complete result for @xmath1",
    "is obtained after summing the series .",
    "+   + the peculiar perturbation theory like parameterizations and the procedure employed are the reason we are able to compute @xmath1 , for arbitrarily large @xmath65 space - like momenta , for the first time in a continuum approach directly connected to qcd . for a complete explanation and more detail",
    ", please consult our published article @xcite .",
    "this procedure has also previously been employed to compute the pion s elastic electromagnetic form factor and pion s pda @xcite .",
    "various studies indicate that the pion pda is a broad concave function , and at the resolution scales achieved so far , it is far from being similar to the asymptotic pda , @xmath68 . according to @xcite ,",
    "it is defined by the expression : @xmath69 where @xmath70 ; the trace is over spinor indices ; @xmath71 is the quark wave - function renormalisation constant ; @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , @xmath74 ; and @xmath75/2 $ ] , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "the way it evolves towards its asymptotic limit is described through the efremov - radyushkin - brodsky - lepage ( erbl ) evolution equations @xcite .    * pion s pda * : [ solid , blue ] @xmath79 .",
    "[ dot - dashed , black ] erbl evolution to @xmath80 .",
    "[ green , dotted ] asymptotic pda , @xmath68 .",
    "as we can see , the broad concave pda , @xmath79 , slowly approaches to its asymptotic form with increasing momentum scale.,width=415 ]     +   + from figure [ fig : pda ] , we see that pion s pda at resolution scale @xmath81 gev , @xmath82 , slowly evolves to its asymptotic form .",
    "evolution enables the dressed - quark and antiquark degrees of freedom , in terms of which the wave function is expressed at a given scale , to split into less well - dressed partons via the addition of gluons and sea quarks in the manner prescribed by qcd dynamics .",
    "the connection of @xmath83 with @xmath1 is given by the leading twist expression for the transition form factor : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the photon - quark - antiquark scattering amplitude at some scale @xmath86 .",
    "one expects to reach the asymptotic limit from below , otherwise one would have to explain why @xmath1 grows bigger and then decreases towards @xmath2 .",
    "qcd is not known to have an additional scale to set in at a higher @xmath65 to make this happen .",
    "only logarithmic corrections have a minor role to play .",
    "we shall see that the evolution of @xmath83 is crucial in understanding the asymptotic behavior of the pion transition form factor .",
    "further details of pion s pda can be found in javier cobos contribution to this proceedings volume and in @xcite .",
    "our main result is depicted in figure [ fig : tff ] .",
    "we obtain an interaction radius of @xmath87 fm , which is practically identical to the one computed in @xcite within the same scheme .",
    "the abelian anomaly , namely @xmath88 , is satisfied ; the asymptotic limit , @xmath2 , is reached from below except for a logarithmic miss - match .",
    "our result agrees fairly well with all available data below @xmath3 gev@xmath4 , and with belle data at large @xmath65 scales .",
    "however , it fails to reconcile with the data reported by the babar collaboration .",
    "* pion s transition form factor * : [ solid , black ] dse prediction obtained with the erbl evolution of pion bsa .",
    "[ dashed , blue ] dse prediction without evolution at frozen scale @xmath89 . *",
    "data : * [ circles , red ] babar @xcite , [ diamonds , purple ] cello @xcite , [ squares , blue ] cleo @xcite , [ stars , green ] belle @xcite .",
    "the ( green ) shaded band is described in @xcite.,width=415 ]     +   + from figure 2 , we see that @xmath1 exceeds ( logarithmically ) the asymptotic limit @xmath2 , although we expected such limit to be reached from below .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the growth is only logarithmic , and at some point , it settles onto the value @xmath2 .",
    "this discrepancy originates from the failure of the rainbow - ladder ( rl ) truncation to reproduce the complete set of gluon and quark splitting effects contained in qcd and hence its inability to fully express interferences between the anomalous dimensions of those @xmath90-point schwinger functions which are relevant in the computation of a given scattering amplitude .",
    "we describe a computation of the pion transition form factor , in which all elements employed are determined by the solutions of the qcd s dses , obtained in the rl truncation .",
    "* the novel analysis techniques made it possible to compute @xmath1 , on the entire domain of space - like momenta , in a continuum framework directly connected to qcd .",
    "* our work unifies the description and explanation of this transition with the charged pion electromagnetic form factor and its pda .",
    "* this enables us to demonstrate that a fully self - contained and consistent treatment can readily connect a pion pda , that is a broad and concave function at the hadronic scale , with the perturbative qcd prediction for the transition form factor in the hard photon limit .",
