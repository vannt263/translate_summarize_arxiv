    "the study of correlations among particles produced in different rapidity regions may provide understanding of the mechanisms of particle production .",
    "strong short - range correlations ( src ) are observed in hardon - hadron collisions , indicating clustering over a region of @xmath11 unit in rapidity @xcite .",
    "correlations that extend over a longer range are observed in hadron - hadron interactions only at higher energies @xcite .",
    "multiparticle production can be described in terms of color strings stretched between the oncoming partons .",
    "these strings then decay into observed secondary hadrons . in this scenario ,",
    "the strings emit particles independently @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that long - range correlations ( lrc ) might be enhanced in hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions , compared to hadron - hadron scattering at the same energy @xcite .",
    "one way to study the correlation is to measure forward - backward multiplicity correlations which have been studied in several experiments @xcite .",
    "the correlation strength is defined by the dependence of the average charged particle multiplicity in the backward hemisphere @xmath2 , on the event multiplicity in the forward hemisphere @xmath3 , @xmath2=a+@xmath4@xmath3 , where a is a constant and @xmath4 measures the strength of the correlation@xcite : @xmath5 in `` eq.(1 ) '' @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the backward - forward and forward - forward dispersions respectively .",
    "the data utilized for this analysis is for au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , as measured by the star experiment @xcite .",
    "the collision events were part of the minimum bias data set .",
    "the centralities presented in this analysis account for 0 - 10% , 10 - 20% , 20 - 30% , 30 - 40% and 40 - 50% of the total hadronic cross section and were obtained by use of the multiplicity of all charged particles ( @xmath8 ) measured in the tpc with @xmath90.5 .",
    "all charged particles in the time projection chamber ( tpc ) pseudorapidity range @xmath10 and with @xmath11 0.15 gev / c were considered .",
    "this region was subdivided into bin widths @xmath12 .",
    "the forward - backward intervals were located symmetrically about midrapidity with the distance between bin centers ( @xmath13 ) : 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , 1.0 , 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.6 , and 1.8 .",
    "an analysis of the data from _ pp _ collisions at 200 gev was also performed on minimum bias events using the same quality cuts as in the case of au+au .",
    "corrections for detector geometric acceptance and tracking efficiency were carried out using a monte carlo event generator and propagating the simulated particles through a geant representation of the star detector geometry .    in order to eliminate ( or at least reduce ) the effect of impact parameter ( centrality ) fluctuations on this measurement , each relevant quantity ( @xmath3 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 )",
    "was obtained on an event - by - event basis as a function of @xmath8 , and was fitted to obtain the average values of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this method removes the dependence of the correlation strength b , on the size of the centrality bin @xmath8 . tracking efficiency and acceptance corrections",
    "were applied to each event .",
    "systematic effects dominate the error determination .",
    "the systematic errors are determined by varying cuts on the z - vertex @xmath21 ( @xmath22 30 , 20 , and 10 cm ) , number of fit points on the individual tracks in the tpc .",
    "the plot of correlation strength ( @xmath4 ) as a function of the pseudorapidity gap is shown in fig .",
    "[ centralau ] for the 0 - 10% most central au+au events .",
    "it is observed that the value of @xmath4 does not change with the pseudorapidity gap . fig .",
    "1 also shows @xmath4 as a function of @xmath13 for 40 - 50% mid - central au+au collisions . in this case @xmath4 decreases with the increasing @xmath13 , which is expected if there were only short range correlations .",
    "short range correlations have been extensively studied .",
    "the shape of the src function has a maximum at , and is symmetric about , midrapidity ( pseudorapidity , @xmath23 = 0 ) .",
    "it can be fitted with a gaussian or an exponential function @xcite .",
    "the short range correlations are significantly reduced by a separation of 1.5 - 2.0 units of pseudorapidity @xcite .",
    "[ centralau ] shows that in case of 0 - 10% most central au+au the @xmath4 value is flat with @xmath13 , while the mid central 40 - 50% has a sharp fall like src . since the analysis is limited to @xmath24 , the short range component can not be completely eliminated .",
    "collisions is used to estimate the short range component from au+au collisions .",
    "[ peripauandpp ] shows @xmath4 as a function of @xmath13 for the _ pp _ collisions .",
    "the @xmath4 value from _ pp _ decays exponentially with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "[ centralau ] and fig .",
    "[ peripauandpp ] show that the correlation strength with @xmath13 is quite different in 0 - 10% au+au as compared to _",
    "an analysis of the mid - central and peripheral events in au+au shows that for the 40 - 50% centrality bin the shape of correlation strength b with @xmath13 is similar to the _ pp _ case .    traditionally , the lrc is measured with a large gap in the forward - backward window and is based on experimental observation of charged particle correlations in @xmath25 at @xmath26 200 , 500 , and 900 gev @xcite .",
    "the strength of the src is reduced considerably with a @xmath13 of 2.0 units .",
    "thus the remaining portion of the correlation strength is mainly due to the lrc . as shown in fig .",
    "[ peripauandpp ] , it appears that _ pp _ at 200 gev only has a src .",
    "we assume that the fall of src as a function of @xmath13 does not change in going from @xmath27 to au+au .",
    "the 40 - 50% au+au supports this assumption . to extract the short range part in 0 - 10% au+au collisions ,",
    "the _ pp _ value of @xmath4 at @xmath28 ( non - overlapping measurement windows ) , is scaled up to the @xmath4 value in the au+au case , as the src has a maximum at @xmath29 . @xmath4 vs @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ peripauandpp ] for _ pp _ was fitted with an exponential function .",
    "the scaled @xmath4 value for the other @xmath13 points were calculated using the fit function .",
    "the remaining part of the correlation strength ( long range ) , is obtained by subtracting the short range component from the measured correlation strength .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ centevolution ] as the long range .",
    "there is a growth of the lrc with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "two other analyses in star have focused on the correlations of charged particle pairs in @xmath13 ( pseudorapidity ) and @xmath30 ( azimuth ) @xcite .",
    "it was observed that near - side peak is elongated in @xmath13 in central au+au as compared to peripheral collisions .",
    "the centrality of the collision plays an important role in the growth of long range component of the total correlation strength .",
    "data from 10 - 20% , 20 - 30% , and 30 - 40% most central au+au collisions have been analyzed , following the same procedure as for 0 - 10% centrality , to determine the evolution of the lrc strength .",
    "the growth of lrc is shown in fig [ centevolution ] .",
    "the magnitude of the lrc is quite large for the most central collisions when @xmath31 1.0 . from fig .",
    "[ centevolution ] it is clear that the magnitude of the lrc increases from peripheral to central collisions .    the 0 - 10% results are also compared with phenomenological models hijing @xcite and the dpm @xcite .",
    "monte carlo codes hijing and the parton string model ( psm ) @xcite were used to generate minimum bias events for au+au collisions at 200 gev .",
    "the psm is based on dpm @xcite .",
    "the analysis was carried out in the same manner as with real data .",
    "the psm was used without the string fusion option .",
    "the variation of b with @xmath13 is shown in fig .",
    "[ models ] along with the experimental value for 0 - 10% central au+au collisions .",
    "hijing predicts src with a large value of @xmath4 near midrapidity in agreement with the data .",
    "a sharp decrease in @xmath4 is seen beyond the @xmath32 1.0 .",
    "psm has both short and long range correlations and is in qualitative agreement with the data .    in the dpm",
    "the particle production occurs via string fragmentation .",
    "there are two strings per inelastic collision and the long range component is expressed as @xmath33 { \\langle n_{q-\\overline{q}}\\rangle}_{f }   { \\langle n_{q-\\overline{q}}\\rangle}_{b } \\label{lrc}\\ ] ] where the average multiplicities of @xmath34 in the forward and backward regions is given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively in each elementary inelastic collision . ``",
    "( [ lrc ] ) '' shows that the lrc is due to fluctuations in the number of elementary inelastic collisions .",
    "it is believed that the experimental observation of the lrc originates from these multiple partonic interactions .",
    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) provides a theoretical qcd based description of multiple string interactions @xcite .",
    "the cgc @xcite argues for the existence of a lrc in rapidity , similar to those predicted in dpm .",
    "recently , long range forward - backward multiplicity correlations have been discussed in the framework of the cgc and predict the growth of the lrc with the centrality of the collision @xcite .",
    "in summary , this is the first work on the measurement of the long - range correlation strength ( @xmath4 ) , in ultra relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the dpm and cgc argue that the long range correlations are due to multiple parton - parton interactions .",
    "this indicates that dense quark - gluon matter is formed in central au+au collisions at @xmath0 = 200 gev .",
    "an analysis of the correlation for baryons can further address the cgc picture .",
