    "in this paper which is a companion to @xcite , the goal remains the study of foliations on non - metrisable manifolds .",
    "since we recall some basic motivations and also provide a generous system of cross - references , familiarity with  @xcite should not be a prerequisite .",
    "one of the central ideas emerging in @xcite is the ` rigidity ' of foliations on certain simple non - metrisable manifolds coming with a ` cylindrical decomposition ' in the sense that they factor out a copy of the long ray @xmath0 ( or the allied long line @xmath1 ) . on such manifolds",
    ", foliation theory collapses to a minimalist art form . for instance (",
    "* corollary  7.7 ) states that the long plane @xmath2 carries only two foliations up to homeomorphism .",
    "in fact the bulk of the ` rigidity paradigm ' lies in a prediction of the asymptotic behaviour of any one - dimensional foliation on a manifold admitting a product decomposition of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a ` small ' ( for instance : metrisable ) manifold .",
    "this prediction is prompted by two dual theorems ( theorem  5.2 and proposition  5.3 ) forcing the foliation to be either _ ultimately vertical _ or _ asymptotically horizontal _ , depending on the presence ( or not ) of a long leaf .",
    "the former alternative means that the foliation is vertical on @xmath5 for some @xmath6 , while the latter asserts that the horizontal slices @xmath7 are saturated by the foliation for a closed unbounded subset of @xmath8 s in @xmath0 .",
    "_ a posteriori _ one can attempt to fill in the ` metrisable ' gaps left unpredicted in order to gain a complete classification of foliations on the manifold .",
    "this full programme was accomplished for the long plane yielding precisely the above mentioned result on @xmath2 .",
    "it would certainly be desirable to find other examples where the full program can be completed .    in the present paper we adventure more deeply into the jungle of non - metrisable manifolds (",
    "although we mainly investigate surfaces ) by exploring pathological examples beyond the rigidity paradigm . quite inevitably the exposition ramifies into a collection of not - that - much related examples in which a unifying theme is harder to identify .",
    "nonetheless one can keep in mind as ` guiding principle ' the idea of comparison with the classical metric theory .",
    "indeed many of our examples are motivated by trying to understand if certain metric principles extrapolate to the non - metrisable setting .",
    "we shall see that many classical facts are no longer valid when the metric is relaxed .      before stating our results ,",
    "let us recall some definitions that we shall use throughout this paper .",

    "we can also perform the identification in some but not all of the boundary components .",

    "one can similarly define the _ moorization of @xmath67 in @xmath107 _ , or moorize some of the components and not the others .",

    ", applying some poincar  bendixson theory shows that the @xmath67-leaves in @xmath507 must escape from @xmath467 by either its upper boundary or its bottom vertex ( which is really a line segment in @xmath432 ) .",
    "we return to the foliation on all of @xmath433 , and consider @xmath509 , where @xmath510 denotes the copy of @xmath511 in the other copy of @xmath432 .",
    "the closure in @xmath433 of this union is homeomorphic to a rectangle of width @xmath512 and height @xmath513 ( see figure [ figures8 - 9 ] , left ) .",
    "since @xmath507 contains points at each height , we have the @xmath514 cases depicted in figure [ figures8 - 9 ] ( right ) :    * there is a leaf which exits @xmath511 twice by its bottom side ( or as we wrote above , by the vertex ) .",
    "( case i. ) then for some @xmath122 , @xmath515 .",
    "* there is a leaf going right through @xmath511 ( case ii ) , which yields @xmath516 . * there is a sequence of leaves , each exiting @xmath511 twice by its upper side , which approach the bottom side .",
    "case iii is when the leaves are nested , and case iv when they are not .",
    "there is thus an accumulation point of this sequence on @xmath517 , that belongs to some leaf @xmath249 . given any compact portion @xmath518 , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.3 ) there is a small tubular neighbourhood of @xmath519 that is the image through a foliated chart of @xmath520 foliated horizontally .",
    "it follows that @xmath249 can neither enter @xmath510 , nor stay on @xmath425 , and it must exit @xmath521 by its upper side ( since there are leaves doing the same arbitrarily close ) .",
    "thus , @xmath249 goes right through @xmath511 , and @xmath522 .",
    "the lemma is proved",
    ".    we can now prove theorem [ thm31bis ] .",
    "let @xmath67 be the set of @xmath523 such that @xmath291 intersects @xmath425 ( if @xmath441 ) or @xmath524 ( if @xmath431 ) .",
    "by compactness of @xmath291 , @xmath67 is finite .",

    "thus , up to replacing @xmath434 by @xmath529 , one can assume that @xmath291 is empty .",
    "now , by lemma [ 31bis1 ] , considering @xmath530 if necessary , we may assume that the foliation is nice .    fix @xmath483 . by lemma [ 31bis3 ] , @xmath531 .",

    "* proposition 3 ) , already implicit in @xcite ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm31bis ] can easily be arranged to show that this collared version does not possess a foliation ( for appropriate @xmath434 ) .",
    "we thus have examples in two classes : a separable one which is not homotopy equivalent to a cw - complex , and a contractible non - separable one .",

    "we construct a surface as in the title . indeed ,",
    "even removal of a compact subset does not allow a foliation .    begin with the subset of the nyikosization of the plane @xmath80 described in proposition [ thmkiekie ] consisting of the copy of the long ray together with the quadrant @xmath551 but then remove all the points of the subset @xmath9 of the long ray .",
    "for each @xmath55 let @xmath405 denote the open interval @xmath552 of the long ray .",
    "now moorize each of the intervals @xmath405 around the point @xmath553 to get the desired manifold @xmath4 .",
    "denote by @xmath554 the half - open interval coming from the moorization of @xmath405 .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 is foliated by @xmath257 .",
    "as in lemma [ 31bis1 ] , all but countably many of the intervals @xmath554 lie entirely in a leaf of @xmath257 .",
    "each of these leaves then extends a positive distance into @xmath555 and hence there is a positive integer @xmath36 so that uncountably many of these extensions reach the vertical line @xmath556 ; set @xmath557 . for each @xmath558 let @xmath559 be such that @xmath560 is the first point at which the leaf containing @xmath554 meets the line @xmath556",
    "it is readily shown that if @xmath123 then @xmath561 as the leaves can not cross .",
    "the sequence @xmath562 yields a contradiction because it is an uncountable , strictly increasing sequence in @xmath50 .",
    "it is readily checked that @xmath4 is separable ( any countable dense subset of @xmath555 will do ) and simply connected .",
    "a compact subset of @xmath4 will not interfere with the argument regarding non - foliability except to the extent that countably many more elements may need to be removed from @xmath67 .",

    "_ uniqueness _ : ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  6.1 ) applied to each embedded copy of @xmath555 in @xmath86 , reveals that the foliation is either asymptotically horizontal ( h ) or vertical ( v ) .",
    "let us analyse the three possible combinations ( h - h ) , ( h - v ) and ( v - v ) of behaviours occurring on the ` front- ' respectively ` back - side ' of the doubled manifold .",
    "@xmath65 if ( h - v ) , then we concentrate on the shaded region depicted on the central part of figure  [ cornet ] .",
    "flattening this region yields the ` tile ' depicted right below , which in turn after plumbing with a copy along the ` framed ' boundary - data yields again a foliated @xmath11-disc .",
    "@xmath65 finally when ( v - v ) , then we identify easily compact subregions , in fact topological squares ( see the different shadings on the right part of figure  [ cornet ] ) , each of which admits a unique foliated extension according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  6.4 ) .",
    "this completes the proof .    _",
    "( an origami avoiding any fish - eyes perception . ) _ a convenient trick to picture the manifold @xmath86 involves cutting its back - side along the vertical axis then unfolding both octants via reflections at angles @xmath563 and @xmath564 .",
    "the cut manifold unfolds to cover the entire long upper half - plane @xmath565 , except that one has to identify @xmath94 with @xmath566 for all @xmath567 ( reminiscent of the moorization process ) .",
    "this trick can be used to visualise without any fish - eye distortion the regions where we are applying ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  6.4 ) .",
    "in fact , with this method it is also possible to analyse foliations on the bag - pipe surfaces @xmath568 of genus @xmath73 and `` pipus '' @xmath36 , i.e. having @xmath36 pipes modelled on the conical pipes @xmath569 .        our example is built with the ( closed ) first octant of @xmath85 as the building block , defined as before by @xmath570 . in our pictures , we draw an arrow from the horizontal to the diagonal in @xmath403 , see figure [ infa ] ( left ) .    the idea is the following ( see figure [ infb ] , where one particular foliation is drawn as well on the surface ) .",
    "take a countable number of copies of @xmath403 , and then glue them together as follows .",
    "the @xmath571-th copy of @xmath403 , which we label @xmath572 , has a horizontal boundary @xmath573 and a diagonal boundary @xmath574 .",
    "consider the space given by the union of the @xmath572 where @xmath575 is identified pointwise with @xmath576 and @xmath577 is identified with @xmath578 .",
    "( in fact , the union of @xmath579 and @xmath580 is a copy of @xmath581 . )",
    "we then write @xmath582 ( @xmath583 ) for the images in the quotient of the old boundaries , counted counterclockwise ( see figure [ infb ] , the thick lines ) .",
    "say that @xmath582 is a @xmath11-sided diagonal when @xmath571 is odd and a @xmath11-sided horizontal when @xmath571 is even .",
    "we then add a copy of @xmath53 that we call @xmath584 , to which the @xmath585 accumulate , and another octant that we call @xmath586 with horizontal @xmath587 and diagonal @xmath584 , to ` close the circle ' ( again , see figure [ infb ] ) .",
    "denote this surface by @xmath67 . that @xmath67 is a longpipe follows from its definition ,",
    "in fact one can easily write down explicitly @xmath588 , with the @xmath589 given by considering only the part of the octants where @xmath590 .",
    "also , @xmath67 is simply connected .",
    "the octant has two trivial foliations @xmath591 and @xmath592 given by the horizontal and the vertical lines ( of course in the boundary there is a mixed tangent - transverse behavior ) , see figure [ infa ] ( right ) .",
    "these foliations can be glued together to build infinitely many different foliations on @xmath67 .",
    "the foliation @xmath593 is drawn in figure [ infb ] .",
    "if one looks at the foliation restricted in the @xmath572 , it will be horizontal in @xmath594 , @xmath595 , @xmath596 and @xmath586 , and vertical in the other @xmath572 .",
    "the first step is to check that a homeomorphism @xmath598 must send @xmath584 mainly to itself , that is , its image must intersect it on a closed unbounded set .",
    "this is because any copy of @xmath51 must intersect at least one of the @xmath599 ( @xmath600 ) unboundedly .",
    "it is well - known that a copy of @xmath9 in the octant must either be contained in a horizontal ( except possibly countably many points ) , or it intersects the diagonal on a closed unbounded set .",
    "thus , @xmath598 will send a closed unbounded set of @xmath584 into a horizontal or a diagonal of some @xmath599 .",
    "but since these horizontals and diagonals do not have the same topological properties as @xmath584 ( to which others accumulate ) , the only possibility is as claimed .    by the same kind of arguments , one sees that the image of a @xmath11-sided diagonal by @xmath598 must intersect unboundedly another @xmath11-sided diagonal .",
    "it follows that the image of each @xmath585 for @xmath457 odd intersects some @xmath601 ( with @xmath602 odd ) unboundedly .",
    "two closed unbounded sets of a diagonal always intersect , thus @xmath603 if @xmath604 .",
    "moreover for each @xmath605 there is @xmath457 with @xmath606 .",
    "it follows that @xmath605 is increasing in @xmath457 , and hence that @xmath607 .",
    "the same kind of construction is possible but piling up @xmath9 copies of the octant instead of countably many .",
    "the resulting surface would then have at least @xmath9 foliations up to homeomorphism . here",
    ", we have shown that @xmath67 has at least countably many foliations , but in fact there are probably no more , since an investigation similar to the one made for @xmath85 in @xcite should be possible , yielding that the given foliations are the only ones , up to homeomorphism .",
