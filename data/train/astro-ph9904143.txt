    "although the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) sky survey will present the first view of the distribution and kinematics of the warm ionized medium ( wim ) , we still know little about the physical conditions in this gas or how they are produced .",
    "several studies have measured constraints on important parameters toward specific regions of the wim , but none has yet provided a large sample of measurements to help test how environmental conditions ( _ e.g. _  distance from   regions , distance from the galactic plane , etc . ) might affect these physical conditions .",
    "reynolds ( 1985a ) derived the first estimate of the temperature of the wim by combining measured line widths of [ ] and h@xmath6  emission toward the same regions .",
    "he was able to place limits between 5,000 k and 20,000 k , with a mean of about 8,000 k , on the temperature of a sample of 21 wim observations .",
    "ionization conditions have been probed even less , with most of our current information coming from observations in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "reynolds ( 1985b ) showed that [ ] @xmath13 emission is very faint in the wim , placing limits on the amount of o@xmath11 ( needing @xmath14 ev ) in the wim .",
    "more conclusively , reynolds & tufte ( 1995 ) and tufte ( 1997 ) have shown via observations of the he i @xmath15 recombination line that the fraction of he@xmath16 ( needing @xmath17 ev ) in this gas is also quite low in comparison with traditional o star  regions .",
    "the recent detection of [ ] @xmath18 from three wim directions ( reynolds , et al .",
    "1998 ) places further limits on the ionizing spectrum .",
    "the low [ ] /h@xmath6  ratios seen in all three directions suggests that the h is mostly h@xmath16 in the h@xmath6  emitting gas .",
    "the advent of wham provides a unique opportunity to trace some of these diagnostics over a larger region of the sky .",
    "this paper presents the first velocity - resolved study of [ ] and [ ] from the diffuse gas of our galaxy .",
    "a region of the sky that includes the perseus arm was chosen for examination since the h@xmath6  emission from the wim in this arm is well separated in velocity from local wim emission and can be traced to high galactic latitude , allowing an exploration of the emission with distance , @xmath8 , from the galactic plane .",
    "such observations can be directly compared to studies of edge - on galaxies , most notably those by rand ( 1997 , 1998 ) of ngc 891 .",
    "the primary trends found in his work are borne out here and extended to even fainter emission measures .",
    "specifically , [ ] /h@xmath6  and [ ] /h@xmath6  ratios increase with @xmath9 , while [ ] / [ ] ratios remain nearly constant .    a brief description of the instrument and observations are presented in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] .",
    "the results from the data , including a measurement of the electron scale height in the perseus arm and an investigation of the trends in line ratios , are presented in  [ sec : results ] . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we present our interpretation that these line ratios provide direct measurements of the temperature and ionization state of the wim . finally , our conclusions are summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "due to the extended nature of the wim , large - aperture fabry - perot detection techniques have proven to be quite successful in studying the wim ( reynolds et al .",
    "1990 ) . for wham , a 6-inch , dual - etalon fabry - perot spectrometer delivers the high - efficiency , high - resolution observations ( tufte 1997 ; reynolds et al .  1998 ) .",
    "the dual - etalon design provides superior order rejection over single - etalon systems to achieve a much larger free spectral range while maintaining high spectral resolution ( 12 km  s@xmath19 ) . an all - sky siderostat housing a 0.6-meter lens guides light to the etalon chambers in an environmentally controlled trailer .",
    "the center wavelength of the 200 km  s@xmath19  spectral window is selected by changing the pressure of a high index of refraction gas ( sf@xmath20 ) in sealed etalon chambers . a narrow - band ( @xmath21   fwhm ) interference filter provides additional spectral isolation near the desired wavelength .",
    "the resulting spectrum , in the form of a fabry - perot ring pattern , is imaged onto a cryogenically cooled tek 1024@xmath221024 ccd .",
    "the spectrum covers a 200 km  s@xmath19  interval at 12 km  s@xmath19  spectral resolution .",
    "coatings on the etalons and optics allow the placement of the 200 km  s@xmath19  wide spectral window anywhere between 4800 and 7300  . in this `` spectral mode , ''",
    "the image contains only the average spectrum within the one - degree diameter circular beam , avoiding confusion between spectral features and angular structures of the source ( or stars ) within the beam .",
    "wham also has a set of optics that can be placed in the post - etalon beam to provide an extremely narrow - band ( adjustable between 12 - 200 km  s@xmath19 ) , 1  angular resolution _ image _ of the sky within a one - degree field of view .",
    "only the spectral mode ( with one - degree angular resolution ) is used for the observations presented here .",
    "further details on the wham spectrometer and its calibration can be found in tufte ( 1997 ) .",
    "wham is currently located at kitt peak national observatory . using the wiyn messaging system designed by percival ( 1994 , 1995 ) and custom hardware designed by the _ space astronomy lab _ at wisconsin",
    ", wham is a completely remotely operated telescope system .",

    "the h@xmath6  observations of the 1100 deg@xmath23 region @xmath0 to @xmath1 , @xmath2 to @xmath3 that is the focus of this study were obtained between 1997 july and 1997 october as a part of the wham h@xmath6  sky survey ( haffner 1999 ) .",
    "additional observations at the same survey grid points but with the 200 km  s@xmath19   spectral window tuned near the [ ] @xmath24 and [ ] @xmath5 lines were obtained in 1997 october , 1997 november , and 1998 june .",
    "the region presented here is sampled by 1360 h@xmath6 , 1360 [ ] , and 1360 [ ] spectra , each representing the integrated emission within wham s one - degree beam .",
    "the integration time for each spectrum was 30 s for h@xmath6  and 60 s for the other two emission lines .",
    "the [ ] and [ ] observations were converted into spectra using the same steps as those for h@xmath6  presented in haffner ( 1999 ) .",
    "separate white - light flat fields were created for each of these additional filters and used in place of the h@xmath6   flat field .",
    "there are no strong terrestrial components in [ ] or [ ] comparable to the geocoronal emission in the h@xmath6  spectra .",
    "for the [ ] observations , the weak terrestrial ( tucson lights ) ne i line at 6717.04   was used for velocity calibration .",
    "for the [ ] observations , spectra of h@xmath6  and [ ] from bright emission nebulae were compared and the velocity frame of [ ] was adjusted so that the mean velocity of the nebular [ ] emission matched that of the h@xmath6 . by using the terrestrial lines in the h@xmath6  spectra ( geocoronal h@xmath6 ) and [ ] spectra ( ne i ) , the velocity scale in each spectrum is calibrated to better than 1 km  s@xmath19 .",
    "intensities were calibrated by applying a correction factor to the [ ] and [ ] observations ( 0.94 and 1.15 , respectively ) based on the transmission differences between these filters and the h@xmath6  filter .    as in the h@xmath6  observations ,",
    "the [ ] and [ ] spectra are contaminated by weak atmospheric lines ( haffner , reynolds , & tufte 1998 ; haffner 1999 ) .",
    "the brightest of these in our [ ] spectra is the ne i line located @xmath25 km  s@xmath19   from the geocentric zero of [ ] @xmath26 .",
    "as noted above , it proves to be a useful wavelength calibrator . to accurately characterize the parameters of these faint lines in the [ ] and [ ] spectra",
    ", we followed the same strategy outlined in haffner ( 1999 ) for h@xmath6 .",
    "we first created an average spectrum for each survey `` block '' ( @xmath27 pointings taken sequentially ) . using this high signal - to - noise spectra ,",
    "a single gaussian was fitted to each of the atmospheric lines and then subtracted from the individual pointings . such corrections account for hourly variations in these faint lines ( typically @xmath280.02 r ) .",
    "a list of the atmospheric lines in our [ ] and [ ] observations is given in table  [ tab : atlines ] .",

    "this extended  region has been studied in some detail by reynolds ( 1988 ) , who first hypothesized that the bar of emission ( @xmath52 r ) running from @xmath53 , @xmath38 to @xmath54 , @xmath55 centered between @xmath49 to @xmath56 km  s@xmath19  may also be ionized by the star .",
    "the second large emission region , centered near @xmath57 , @xmath58 , is a superposition of separate but equally bright emission regions in the local and perseus arms ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",

    "a future study ( haffner , reynolds , & tufte 1999 ) examining the properties of b - star  regions in the wham h@xmath6  sky survey will expand on this work .",

    "since the perseus arm gas is well separated in velocity from the local emission , we can explore the decrease of this emission as a function of the height above the galactic plane . to extract information about the scale height from the intensity distribution , we first assume that the gas density is primarily a function of @xmath8 and has the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mid - plane density and @xmath71 is the scale - hight of the wim . the h@xmath6  intensity is related to the gas density by the equation @xmath72 where @xmath61 is the filling fraction of the emitting gas , @xmath73 is the temperature of the gas in @xmath74 k , and @xmath75 is in r. as long as the temperature , filling factor , and pathlength through the emitting gas , @xmath76 , are not functions of @xmath8 we then have @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the intensity at the mid - plane . finally , substituting @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the distance to the arm and @xmath7 is the galactic latitude of an observation , and taking the natural log , we arrive at @xmath81    figure  [ fig : havstanb ] plots this relationship for a selected region of the map .",
    "each point represents the median emission between @xmath82 and @xmath83 for each galactic latitude .",
    "the median of the emission in each latitude slice is used instead of an average to reduce the effect of local emission enhancements ( _ e.g. _  faint  regions ) .",
    "the limited longitude range is chosen to avoid the gradual blending of the perseus arm component with the local gas as the longitude approaches @xmath84 .",

    "the integration ranges are expanded from the limited ranges in figures  [ fig : loc - lr ] and [ fig : per - lr ] to include the full emission profile in our calculations .",
    "the error bars for the perseus arm are an estimate of the physical scatter along a latitude slice calculated from the average deviation about the median of emission within that slice .    also displayed in figure  [ fig : havstanb ] is a linear fit to perseus arm points that are above @xmath89 .",
    "closer to the plane ,  regions and extinction play a significant role and these points are excluded from the fit .",
    "the resulting fit parameters are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , leading to a mid - plane intensity for the wim of @xmath92 r and a scale height of @xmath12 kpc if the perseus arm is at @xmath93 kpc ( see reynolds et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ fig : havstanb ] presents a manual fit to the lower envelope of the perseus arm emission .",
    "the resulting parameters are essentially the same : @xmath94 kpc and @xmath95 r. the 1.0 kpc scale height appears to be valid for @xmath9 from 750 pc to at least 1700 pc , the boundary of this studied region .",
    "as mentioned above , this estimate assumes that the filling fraction and temperature do not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "if in fact @xmath61 changes as a function of height above the plane , it affects our estimate of the electron scale height . as shown below in  [ sec : discussion ] , these new observations suggest that the temperature in the wim rises with distance from the galactic plane .",
    "such an effect would increase our estimate of the scale height .",
    "finally , we also note here that the full role of interstellar extinction has not been taken into account within our restricted fitting region .",

    "[ sec : hvsb ] , the general trend in h@xmath6  intensity is that it decreases as the observed gas lies farther from the galactic plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : lrvb ] shows that the relationship of the [ ] /h@xmath6  and [ ] h@xmath6  ratios versus h@xmath6  intensity described above translate directly into an increase of these ratios with increasing @xmath103 ( or @xmath9 ) in the perseus arm .",

    "the tight correlation of [ ] and [ ] emission in figure  [ fig : siivsnii ] results in a fairly constant value of [ ] / [ ] over a wide variety of h@xmath6  intensities and latitudes in both arms .",
    "this result has been seen in numerous studies of the extragalactic wim analogue , commonly referred to as the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) ( otte & dettmar 1999 ; rand 1998 ; wang , heckman , & lehnert 1997 ; greenawalt , walterbos , & braun 1997 ) . as rand covers in detail , current photoionization models",
    "in which variations in [ ] /h@xmath6  and [ ] /h@xmath6  arise primarily from variations in the ionization parameter ( _ e.g. _  domgrgen & mathis 1994 ; sokolowski 1994 ; see also bland - hawthorn , freeman , & quinn 1997 ) have difficulty keeping this ratio constant as [ ] /h@xmath6  and [ ] /h@xmath6  rise .",
    "abundance gradients and  region contamination can be a larger problem in interpreting such ratios in extragalactic studies with the large physical sizes represented by a typical data point .",
    "our new observations within the galaxy provide smaller scales and adequate velocity resolution to separate radial components of gas , avoiding some of these problems .",
    "we suggest that the tight correlation of [ ] / [ ] seen in our data arises simply from the dominance of s@xmath16 and n@xmath16 ionization states in this gas together with the similar excitation potential of these two emission lines .",
    "with increasing electron temperature , [ ] /h@xmath6  and [ ] /h@xmath6  ratios rise together with no change in the [ ] / [ ] ratio . using this premise , namely , that variations in these ratios are due primarily to variations in electron temperature , we attempt to derive estimates of the electron temperature and ionization state of s within our sample .",
    "we start with the basic equation for the intensity of emission lines from collisionally excited ions ( osterbrock 1989 ) , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the collision strength of the transition , @xmath108 is the statistical weight of the ground level , @xmath109 is is the energy of the upper level of the transition above the lower , and @xmath110 is the fraction of downward transitions that produce the emission line in question . we adopt the following parameterized representations of the collision strengths supplied by aller ( 1984 ) , valid from 5000 k to 20,000 k : @xmath111 where @xmath73 is in units of @xmath74 k. a term to account for extinction has not been included in equation  [ eq : collisional ] , since the three lines we are comparing are close in wavelength .    to arrive at any estimates , we must be able to compute the path averaged integrals in these equations . since there is little knowledge yet of the details of the spatial distribution of the physical parameters in the wim , we take the simplest approach and assume that physical values do not vary along a path . for the ratios we calculate below , we need to make this assumption for the temperature , ionization , and abundance of the gas .",
    "our estimates should then be viewed as representative values , rather than accurately reflecting local conditions from where the emission arises .",
    "since we are able to cleanly separate local and perseus arm gas , large - scale galactic variations can be probed along lines of sight , even with this assumption .",
    "this simplification also implies that the line emission from the three ions originates from the same location .",
    "this is probably a valid assumption in the wim , unless local processes on small scales ( _ e.g. _  shocks ) dominate the ionization structure . in the brighter , discrete  regions",
    ", however , this assumption most likely breaks down since the ionization structure of the nebula could be changing significantly within our beam .    with this simplification ,",
    "we arrive at these two equations for the intensity of [ ] and [ ] emission , @xmath112 and @xmath113 where @xmath73 is in units of @xmath74 k and @xmath114 is the emission measure in units of @xmath115 pc .",
    "note also that @xmath116 is now in r. the [ ] / [ ] intensity ratio is then @xmath117 we use the solar ( s / h ) @xmath118 from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and ( n / h ) @xmath119 from meyer , cardelli , & sofia ( 1997 ) for the gas - phase abundances of s and n.    because of the similar first ionization potentials of n and h ( 14.5 and 13.6 ev ) and a weak charge - exchange reaction , n@xmath10/n@xmath120 tracks h@xmath10/h@xmath120 in photoionization models ( sokolowski 1994 ) , so that in h@xmath6  emitting regions , where the fractional ionization of h has been measured to be near unity ( reynolds et al .   1998 ) , n@xmath10/n @xmath121 1 also . however , with a second ionization potential of 29.6 ev , n most likely ionizes no higher than n@xmath10 .",
    "recent photoionization models run by howk & savage ( 1999 ) over a wide range of temperatures and ionization parameters show that even if the ionizing spectrum in the wim is as hard as @xmath122 k , n@xmath11/n @xmath123 .",
    "furthermore , reynolds & tufte ( 1995 ) and tufte ( 1997 ) found that he@xmath10/he ranges from 0.3 to about 0.6 in the wim , suggesting a spectrum that is significantly softer than 40,000 k , and therefore implying a very small n@xmath11/n ratio .",
    "sulfur , on the other hand , has a low enough first ionization potential , 10.4 ev , that it is most likely fully ionized in the gas we are studying . in addition , its second potential , 23.4 ev , lies slightly below the neutral he edge at 24.6 ev .",
    "the existence of he@xmath10 in the wim ( reynolds & tufte 1995 ; tufte 1997 ) and the model calculations of howk & savage ( 1999 ) both imply that indeed some s will be ionized to s@xmath11 .    in the limit where s@xmath10/s and n@xmath10/n are both unity and at a typical wim temperature of @xmath124 , equation  [ eq : siinii ] gives @xmath125 .",
    "this relationship is plotted as the solid line in figure  [ fig : loc - grid ] .",
    "dotted lines of lower slope show the effect of decreasing s@xmath10/s ( presumably due to an increase in s@xmath11 ) while keeping n@xmath10/n @xmath126 . in this interpretation ,",
    "the data imply that s@xmath10/s ranges between about 0.25 and 0.8 , with an average value for the local diffuse background of 0.60.65 .",
    "note that the location of the  region symbols ( filled triangles and squares ) in figure  [ fig : loc - grid ] indicate that these regions have systematically lower s@xmath10/s than the diffuse background .",
    "in these cases the lower ratios are more likely due to the expected behavior that closer to the ionizing source , where the ionization parameter is large , more s@xmath10 is ionized to s@xmath11 , producing a corresponding decrease in the observed [ ] intensity relative to h@xmath6   ( domgrgen & mathis 1994 ; sokolowski 1994 ) .",

    "itoem ] and [ eq : nii ] the [ ] /h@xmath6  ratio is given by @xmath127 since n@xmath10/n @xmath128 h@xmath10/h ( see above ) , the h and n ionization factors can be removed from equation  [ eq : niiha ] , with the result that for a a given ( n / h ) abundance , [ ] /h@xmath6  is only a function of the electron temperature . as an example , the typical wim temperature of @xmath129 then leads to [ ] /h@xmath6  @xmath130 .",
    "lines of constant temperature are plotted on figure  [ fig : loc - grid ] as dashed vertical lines . with a better estimate for temperature from this line ratio",
    ", we also recompute equation  [ eq : siinii ] , including the temperature dependencies this time , to form the dash - dotted line in figure  [ fig : loc - grid ] .",
    "this correction is small .",
    "figure  [ fig : per - grid ] shows the same grid of s@xmath10/s and @xmath131 overplotted on the perseus arm ratios .",
    "the limits placed on s@xmath11/s in the wim by howk & savage ( 1999 ) are at odds with the significant number of points below the s@xmath10/s @xmath132 line in the perseus arm . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] , there may be an atmospheric line within the integration range of perseus arm [ ] emission . by comparing [ ] and [ ] spectra toward the same locations , we derive an upper limit of @xmath133 r for the intensity of this line .",
    "the maximum effect of removing this line is displayed for a few sample points in figure  [ fig : per - grid ] by translating the solid sample error bars points to the location of the dotted error bars .",
    "such a correction would imply a slightly higher s@xmath10/s ratio on average for the perseus arm , but not enough to explain the entire difference between the arms .",
    "we may be probing a harder radiation field in the perseus arm gas than their model input spectra or our assumed value of s / h may be too high . a reduction in the gas phase sulfur abundance by 0.50.75 ( 0.30.1 dex ) would bring our inferred s@xmath11/s fractions more in line with their models .",
    "the perseus arm gas appears to have systematically lower s@xmath10/s than the local arm , with an average value closer to 0.5 .",
    "equation  [ eq : siinii ] shows that differences in abundances between the local and perseus arm could change the slope of the [ ] /h@xmath6   and [ ] /h@xmath6  relationship . however , afflerbach , churchwell , & werner ( 1997 ) measured the galactic abundance gradients in ultra - compact  regions for o , s , and n. using their best fits , n / h falls off faster than s / h with increasing galactocentric distance so that s / n is @xmath134 higher in the perseus arm .",
    "this is the opposite effect needed to explain the difference in the perseus and local arm emission ratios .",
    "more likely , figure  [ fig : per - grid ] suggests that this region of the perseus arm has a higher fraction of s@xmath11 than the local arm region .",
    "rand ( 1998 ) observed an increase in [ ] /h@xmath96  with height above the plane of ngc 891 and concluded that an additional source of ionization is needed beyond photoionization from hot stars in the disk . in a region",
    "where o@xmath11 ions are being maintained , s@xmath10 becomes a less dominant species .",
    "this is consistent with the inferred differences in s@xmath10/s between the perseus arm ( figure  [ fig : per - grid ] ) and local arm ( figure  [ fig : loc - grid ] ) data , since lines of sight pass through the perseus arm at much higher @xmath9 than for local gas .",
    "one problem with this interpretation is that we do not see a substantial fall in the [ ] / [ ] ratio with increasing @xmath9 in the perseus arm ( figure  [ fig : lrvb ] ) . instead of an additional ionizing source",
    ", it is also possible that there are marked differences in the strength of the halo ionizing field between the local and perseus arms .",
    "for example , ngc 891 shows considerable variation in the extent of extended h@xmath6  emission along the galactic plane ( rand , kulkarni , & hester 1990 ; rand 1998 ) .",
    "the scatter of data points suggests significant variations in the electron temperature within the mapped region , from about 6,000 k to 10,000 k. the most striking result from these temperature estimates comes when re - examining the trend of the [ ] /h@xmath6  ratio in figures  [ fig : per - lr]b and [ fig : lrvb ] . from the rise in this ratio with increasing @xmath9 and equation  [ eq : niiha ] ( or the grid of figure  [ fig : per - grid ] ) , we infer that the temperature in the halo rises from about 7,000 k at @xmath135 kpc ( @xmath136 ) to over 10,000 k at @xmath137 kpc ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "if the electron temperature is truly rising with @xmath9 as our results suggest , the calculation of the scale height of h@xmath6   emitting gas (  [ sec : hvsb ] ) becomes more complicated . if we confirm this effect with future observations ( see  [ sec : summary ] ) , the net effect ( equation  [ eq : itoem ] ) is that the true scale height of the gas is larger than the value calculated in ",
    "[ sec : hvsb ] by about 20% .",
    "note also that since fainter regions tend to have higher [ ] /h@xmath6   ( figure  [ fig : niivsha ] ) , our analysis implies that fainter regions are hotter . since @xmath139",
    ", higher temperature regions naturally produce lower h@xmath6  intensities for a given @xmath140 ; however , even after converting @xmath141  to @xmath140 using a varying temperature estimate from the [ ] /h@xmath6  observations , regions with lower @xmath140 are still hotter .",
    "since @xmath140 depends on @xmath142 and the pathlength through the emitting region , one of the two must be smaller in these fainter , hotter regions .",
    "pathlength is an inherently unphysical parameter to link to temperature and we can think of no reason why our data set would bias shorter pathlength sightlines toward higher temperature regions .",
    "thus , we conclude that the hotter regions most likely have smaller @xmath143 . since @xmath144 in our mapped region of the perseus arm decreases with increasing @xmath9 ( see  [ sec : hvsb ] ) , we are not able to ascertain from these data whether @xmath144 or @xmath9 is the fundamental parameter influencing the electron temperature .    one possible explanation for the discrepancy between these results and photoionization models ( _ e.g. _  domgrgen & mathis 1994 ; sokolowski 1994 ) is that at high @xmath9 or low @xmath144 an additional heating source may dominate over the heating from photoionization ( bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "since the heating per volume from photoionization is proportional to @xmath145 ( it is limited by recombination ) , a heating term that is proportional to @xmath144 or did not depend on @xmath144 at all would become dominant at sufficiently low densities .",
    "such an effect would decouple the heating from the ionization of atoms , keeping [ ] / [ ] constant , while driving up the [ ] and [ ] intensities relative to h@xmath6 .",
    "we also note that if such a process exists in the halo , the increase in [ ] /h@xmath96   seen by rand ( 1998 ) in the halo of ngc 891 could be a direct consequence of this additional heating source , and would not require a secondary ionization source .",
    "possible heating sources include , for example , the dissipation of interstellar turbulence ( minter & spangler 1992 ) and the photoionization of interstellar grains ( reynolds & cox 1992 ) .",
    "the idea of an additional heating source will be explored further in a related work ( reynolds , haffner , & tufte 1999 ) .",
    "we have presented the first comprehensive , velocity - resolved maps of [ ] and [ ] in the galaxy . combining the h@xmath6  maps from the wham h@xmath6  sky survey in this region ,",
    "we draw the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "we confirm earlier estimates of the distribution of h@xmath6   emission in the perseus arm ( reynolds 1997 ) . with continuous coverage from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( @xmath146 to @xmath147 pc at @xmath148 pc ) , we find that the electron distribution derived from the emission is described well by an exponential with a scale height of @xmath149 kpc .",
    "/h@xmath6  and [ ] /h@xmath6  emission in our galaxy shows the same rise with increasing @xmath9 as found in observations of edge - on galaxies ( rand 1998 ; golla et al .",
    "these ratios appear to be correlated with each other over a wide range of emission measures and @xmath9 .",
    "we suggest that the correlation between [ ] /h@xmath6  and [ ] /h@xmath6  can be attributed to the fact that changes in these ratios are primarily due to changes in electron temperature rather than ionization parameter , and that scatter in the relationship is caused by variations in s@xmath10/s .",
    "the maps of [ ] /h@xmath6  and [ ] / [ ] ( figures  [ fig : loc - lr ] and [ fig : per - lr ] ) can then be viewed as distributions of electron temperature and ionization state , respectively . with this interpretation",
    ", we derive temperatures in the wim of 6,000 k to 10,000 k and s@xmath10/s ratios of 0.3 to 0.8 .",
    "the average value of s@xmath10/s appears to be lower in the perseus arm .",
    "higher ionization and lower temperatures are mostly found in the two  regions surrounding the o star @xmath39 per and the b star system @xmath61 per .",
    "differences in temperature between regions may be able to be directly confirmed with observations of the faint , higher - level [ ] @xmath1505755 transition , which when combined with our @xmath1506483 measurements can directly measure the electron temperatures in the emitting gas .",
