    "when @xmath4 violation was first observed in neutral kaon decay , in the early 1960s , it shook the foundations of particle physics .",
    "it had previously been assumed that the combination of charge conjugation and a parity transformation left all known particle interactions invariant , despite the fact that weak interactions violated parity alone . over the following three decades",
    "@xmath4 violation in the @xmath8 system was measured with ever increasing precision in an attempt to pin down its source . in the 1970s kobyashi and maskawa",
    "@xcite showed that the standard model could accommodate @xmath4 violation in a three quark weak mixing matrix , @xmath9 .",
    "the single non - trivial phase in such a @xmath10 unitary matrix could explain the small effect first seen in @xmath8 meson decay , where @xmath4 violation was observed at the @xmath11 level .",
    "it was suggested  @xcite , in the early 1980s , that the comparable amplitudes for the direct decay of @xmath12 mesons into @xmath4 eigenstates and the mixing of @xmath13 mesons would make neutral @xmath0 meson decay an ideal place to observe large indirect @xmath4 violating effects .    one way to understand",
    "the magnitude of @xmath4 violation predicted by the ckm model , in neutral @xmath0 meson decay , is to consider the unitarity relation between the first and third columns of @xmath9 : @xmath14 while each term in this expression is relatively small ( @xmath15 ) , they are all the same size . when plotted in the complex plane ( see fig .",
    "[ unitarity ] ) one expects significant angles at each apex because the sides of the triangle have similar lengths . in neutral kaon decay",
    "the corresponding unitarity triangle has two sides that are much larger than the third  making the decay rates for @xmath8 mesons much larger , but making the angles , and hence the observable phases small and more challenging to measure .    in @xmath0",
    "meson decay @xmath4 violating phases are most readily observed through the indirect mixing of two amplitudes . given a @xmath4 eigenstate accessible to both @xmath12 and @xmath16 decays  such as @xmath17  one can observe the interference between the direct decay amplitude for : @xmath18 and the amplitude for the same decay preceded by @xmath12 mixing : @xmath19 when one includes the relative phase between these two amplitudes we get an expression for the time dependent @xmath4 asymmetry :    [ cols=\"^,^ , < \" , ]     we perform the same analysis on samples of @xmath20 decays .",
    "though the number of candidates in this sample is even smaller , we can begin to probe their @xmath4 asymmetry .",
    "we separate the @xmath21 candidates into two samples . when @xmath22 the final state has @xmath23 providing another potentially clean determination of @xmath24 .",
    "the statistics limited result is shown in table  [ tab : rare ] .",
    "the remaining sample is somewhat larger , providing a more incisive measurement of the @xmath4 asymmetry .",
    "studies of similar non - resonant decays related to this one by isospin ( such as @xmath25 ) have shown that our @xmath26 sample is @xmath27 @xmath4 even .",
    "this bound on the @xmath4 symmetry of the non - resonant @xmath21 final state translates into an additional systematic on the effective @xmath28 , listed in table  [ tab : rare ] .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath4 eigenvalue in this mode will improve with additional data so the non - resonant mode might eventually provide another clean measurement of @xmath24 , or a glimpse of a non - standard model phase this decay .",
    "belle has studied the decay of @xmath12 mesons into a number of @xmath4 eigenstates .",
    "the most precise measurement of @xmath24 to date comes from the modes @xmath29 .",
    "most of the systematic uncertainties involved in that measurement come from calibrations of our flavour tagging and decay vertexing procedure based on control samples .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect that the precision on @xmath24  both statistical and systematic  will improve as more data becomes available .",
    "figure  [ cp_prospects ] shows a prediction of how the precision on @xmath24 will scale as belle collects more data .",
    "the lowest curve shows the evolution of the systematic uncertainty on @xmath24 in the @xmath30 measurement .",
    "it should improve until as least 1000 fb@xmath1 ( 1 ab@xmath1 ) of data has been collected . at that point",
    "we expect an overall precision ( uppermost thin line in fig .  [ cp_prospects ] ) of @xmath31 .",
    "the rarer modes will also benefit from the increase in statistics .",
    "belle expects to be able to accumulate 1 ab@xmath1 of data in the next 3 or 4 years . at that point",
    "the precision on the @xmath32 asymmetry should approach the precision that we currently have on the @xmath30 asymmetry .",
    "if there are other modes contributing to the phase in @xmath32 decay un - natural fine - tuning would be necessary for our precision not to reveal some discrepancy between what would otherwise be two measurements of the same quantity .",
    "the @xmath0 factories were built to confirm the @xmath4 violation predicted by the ckm model in @xmath12 meson decay ",
    "they have now achieved that milestone .",
    "having made a measurement of @xmath24 with a precision of 10% in the @xmath33 modes , and are now pushing to improve the precision to a few percent . at the same time they are expanding the scope of their study to other decay processes . in doing",
    "so they will measure other angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "this will over - constrain the ckm model and test whether there is physics beyond the three known families of quarks and their standard model electroweak decays . in the coming years",
    "the flavour sector will become ever more constrained reducing the range of physics that could explain why we have three families of quarks ."
