    "the two sources hercules a ( 3c 348 ) and mrc 0625 - 536 are radio galaxies classified as",
    "fanaroff - riley i ( fr  i ) type objects , although hercules a has indeed the morphology of a fr  i radio galaxy , but with a much higher radio luminosity , typical of a fr  ii object .",
    "the galaxy associated with mrc 0625 - 536 is the main member of the cluster a 3391 , while hercules a lies in a group .",
    "recent spectral and morphological analyses of x - ray data , collected by rosat and asca ( otani et al .",
    "1998 , siebert et al . 1999 ,",
    "gliozzi et al .",
    "2000 ) , have provided information on the physical and dynamical properties of the environment surrounding these objects and of their active nuclei .",
    "both radio galaxies are embedded in diffuse clouds of x - ray emitting hot plasma of size larger than the extended , radio emitting , regions .",
    "the active nucleus may also contribute to the x - ray flux , as observed in several fr  i radio galaxies , and this emission is likely related to the inner region of the relativistic jet ( worrall & birkinshaw 1994 , trussoni et al .",
    "1999 , hardcastle & worrall 1999 ) .",
    "in this paper we present bepposax observations of hercules a and mrc 0625 - 536 .",
    "this analysis provides new information on the structure of these radio galaxies and their associated clusters .",
    "in fact , the instrumentation on board of bepposax allows us to collect data , during the same pointing , that range from the soft band up to @xmath5 kev .",
    "we will also examine the variation of the spectral parameters of the x - ray emission across the clusters , relying upon the smoother ( with respect to the asca detectors ) radial behavior of the point spread function of the bepposax mecs detectors .    in section 2",
    "we summarize the known properties of the two sources , in section 3 we outline the details of the observations and of the data analysis while in section 4 we report the results of the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "their implications on the structure of the two sources are discussed in detail in section 5 , taking into account also previous observations , and in section 6 we summarize our results .",
    "a value of @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 is assumed throughout .",
    "we list in table 1 the main properties of hercules a and mrc 0625 - 536 and recall in the following the available literature .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath8 @xmath9 ; quantities without errors are fixed    @xmath10 photons @xmath11 s@xmath7 kev@xmath7 ( at 1 kev )      the flux detected in the mecs in the whole region ( @xmath12 in radius ) is fit to a thermal emission model with @xmath13 kev and @xmath14 , assuming @xmath15 @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "the total unabsorbed flux is @xmath16 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 , with luminosity of @xmath17 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 , in both the 2 - 10 kev and 0.1 - 2.4 kev bands .    after selecting four concentric circular regions with spacing @xmath18 we carried out fits to the emitted fluxes deriving values of the temperature and metallicity basically consistent with the ` average ' values obtained analyzing the whole cluster region ( see table 4 and fig .",
    "we obtain a similar value for the temperature @xmath19 setting @xmath20 in the fit . in the innermost region we can notice an increase in temperature and a decrease in metallicity , that may be a signature of non thermal emission from the active nucleus .    to test this point further , we have verified that the central flux also fit a power law model with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the total number of photons from this zone ( @xmath23 ) does not allow a complete analysis with a composite spectrum .",
    "setting @xmath24 kev , @xmath25 and @xmath26 we obtain acceptable fits ( @xmath27 ) with fluxes of the two components ( 2 - 10 kev , with large errors ; see table 4 ) @xmath28 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 and @xmath29 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to a nuclear luminosity of @xmath30 erg s@xmath7 ( a similar value of @xmath31 is obtained in the softer band 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) .",
    "little useful information can be obtained from the lecs observation : setting @xmath20 we derive @xmath32 kev and @xmath33 @xmath11 ( @xmath34 , 12 d.o.f . ) .",
    "this value is larger than the galactic column density by a factor @xmath35 , however its lower limit ( at 2@xmath36 level ) , @xmath37 @xmath11 , is coincident with @xmath38 .",
    "the flux detected in the high energy band by the pds ( at @xmath39 level ) is well above the extrapolated thermal emission from the cluster and from the active nucleus , assuming the parameters derived from the mecs observation .",
    "in fact , the fluxes expected in the 15 - 200 kev energy range are @xmath40 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 and @xmath41 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 , respectively , below the detection capability of the pds ( see fig .",
    "the values of the temperature and metallicity obtained by the bepposax observations are fully consistent with those of asca and pspc ( otani et al .",
    "1998 ) within @xmath42 statistical fluctuations .",
    "the total luminosity from the cluster in the 2 - 10 kev range is @xmath43 lower than derived from asca consistently with the slightly smaller region of photon extraction assumed for the mecs .",
    "the nuclear luminosity derived from the hri observation ( gliozzi et al .",
    "1999 ) exceeds by a factor @xmath44 the one predicted by the correlation of canosa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , but is still within 90% of uncertainty .",
    "this would suggest the absence of heavy local absorption in the nucleus of this radio galaxy .",
    "however , the mecs data indicate a much higher luminosity ( by a factor @xmath45 6 ) with respect to hri , but , due to the large statistical fluctuations , the lower limit of the luminosity in the mecs is @xmath46 three times the one in the hri . assuming no variability , this discrepancy could be ascribed to a local column density of @xmath47 @xmath11 surrounding the core . this point will be discussed further in the next section , considering also the results of the pds observation .",
    "we outline the main implications of the bepposax observations considering also previous observations from other satellites .",
    "our results confirm the discrepant value of the temperature of the thermal diffuse emission obtained from the asca and rosat observations and support the possibility that a two temperature plasma is present in hercules a. however , since both mecs and pspc data are consistent with emission from an isothermal medium , it is difficult to gain some insights about the origin of these two thermal components .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to merge the lecs and mecs data to perform a spectral fit with a two temperature model ( see section 3 ) .",
    "some clues for the interpretation of this phenomenology may be provided by the hri image ( siebert et al .",
    "1999 ) , that shows peculiar morphologies , unrelated to the extended thermal gas and suggested to originate from the interaction of the expanding radio lobes with the hot medium .",
    "we can then argue that this processed gas has physical conditions far from those of a plasma in ionization equilibrium . on the other hand ,",
    "the extent of this irregular structure is smaller but comparable with the size of the diffuse region modeled with a @xmath48 profile ( @xmath49 , see fig . 4 of siebert et al .",
    "1999 ) , such that the imaging capability of the mecs does not allow to spatially disentangle these different regions .",
    "it is worth noticing that the luminosity and temperature of the thermal plasma detected in hercules a are consistent with the correlation found for the galaxy clusters ( wu et al .",
    "therefore , the x - ray properties of this object are typical of rich clusters , despite the fact that hercules a has been associated with a group of galaxies , which would be expected to show a lower temperature and luminosity ( zirbel 1997 , ponman et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the mecs data confirm also that only a small fraction of emission from the central region can originate from the core , that however it is very bright when compared with similar objects .",
    "it turns out that in fact that the x - ray luminosity of the nucleus of hercules a is typical of that of fr  ii narrow lines radio galaxies ( @xmath50 w hz@xmath7 sr@xmath7 , see fig . 6 in hardcastle & worrall 1999 )",
    "this may mean that extra contributions to the core emission could come from other components , e.g. from an thick accretion disk ( we can not exclude also that the inner nucleus is actually obscured by the torus and the non thermal x - ray emission originate from the jet on much larger scales ) .",
    "on the other hand , the optical and radio core luminosities are consistent with the properties of fr  i radio galaxies where obscuration does not play a relevant role and no thick accretion disks appear to be present ( chiaberge et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however the above argument implies that in this radio galaxy the low value of the core radio luminosity , with respect to the total one , may not be a reliable indicator of local absorption in the nucleus .    in conclusion , hercules a appears very peculiar at x - ray energies on large and small scales : observations from the new generation telescopes ( chandra ) will provide new insights on this interesting object .",
    "the mecs data confirm the spectral properties obtained by the previous observations with asca and rosat .",
    "the values of the temperature and metallicity are typical for a cluster , and the luminosity is again consistent with the @xmath51-@xmath19 correlation ( wu et al .",
    "the lack of any variation of the temperature across the region of emission confirms that this cluster has very likely undergone a merging process ( see also otani et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the detection of hard x - ray flux in the pds , even though weak , may have important implications on the interpretation of this radio galaxy .",
    "x - ray emission above 20 kev is commonly observed in seyfert galaxies ( see e.g. matt 1998 ) . among clusters ,",
    "hard x - ray emission has been found so far only in coma and a 2256 with good significance , and in a 2199 with marginal significance ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 , kaastra et al . 1999 )    as stated in sect .",
    "4.2 , the high energy emission can not be the extrapolation of the thermal emission from the intracluster plasma , detected from the mecs .",
    "should this emission originate from a hotter thermal component , the fit to the pds data would require a temperature @xmath52 kev . we can reasonably exclude the presence in this cluster of a plasma with these extreme physical conditions .    for investigating the origin of the hard emission , we have first looked for possible contamination by a different source in the pds field of view . the nearby cluster",
    "a 3395 falls within the pds field of view , but its thermal emission could not increase the flux by more than a factor @xmath53 ( henriksen & jones 1996 ) .",
    "a bl - lac object , ms 0622.5 - 5256 , is present in the pds field , at the position ra@xmath54",
    "= 06@xmath55 23@xmath56 39.1@xmath57 , dec@xmath54 = -52@xmath58 57@xmath59 49@xmath60 , i.e. at about 49@xmath59 from the field center .",
    "the flux of this source in the 0.3 - 3.5 kev energy band is @xmath61 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 , estimated assuming a power - law spectrum with a photon index @xmath62=2 ( stocke et al . 1991 ) . extrapolating this flux to the pds energy band , and correcting for the attenuation due to the distance of the bl - lac from the field center",
    ", it turns out that it is about 100 times lower than the flux detected in the pds and therefore can not be responsible for it , unless an unusually strong variability in the flux of the bl - lac object has occurred .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable to consider that the pds flux is of non - thermal origin , and actually originating from the target itself .",
    "we consider in the following three main possibilities : 1 ) it is related to the nucleus of the radio galaxy mrc 0625 - 536 ; 2 ) it is related to the radio lobes of mrc 0625 - 536 ; 3 ) it is associated to the cluster a 3391 .",
    "\\1 ) in this case , the hard x - ray emission would originate from the core of radio galaxy mrc 0625 - 536 .",
    "a similar case is represented by the radio galaxy ngc 1275 ( 3c 84 ) , in the perseus cluster , where hard non thermal emission has been detected by oso7 ( rothschild et al . 1981 ) .",
    "bepposax observations have confirmed the existence of x - ray emission at energies exceeding 20 kev , with flux of @xmath63 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 in the 20 - 100 kev band ( molendi 1998 ) . according to the mecs analysis and to the results of previous observations ,",
    "the emission from the core of mrc 0625 - 536 is not detectable in the pds energy range .",
    "one might , however , speculate on the existence of a component with a much flatter spectral index : for @xmath64 one would derive a ( 15 - 200 kev ) flux of @xmath65 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath66 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "fitting the mecs flux from the central region ( radius @xmath67 ) to a composite spectrum with the same parameters as in table 3 for the thermal component , and with @xmath64 for the power law spectrum , one obtains for the latter a flux @xmath68 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 in the 15 - 200 kev band , @xmath69 times less than detected in the pds .",
    "however , considering the large statistical fluctuations , the difference between the upper limit of the mecs flux and the lower limit of the pds flux ( 90% of confidence ) reduces to a factor @xmath70 .",
    "a larger discrepancy is found with the hri data on the nuclear emission , that is @xmath71 3 times less than the lower limit of the pds flux .",
    "this difference disappears if some amount of obscuration is present with @xmath72 @xmath11 , as deduced in section 4.2 . in this case",
    "the intrinsic core luminosity in the soft band would increase by a factor @xmath53 .",
    "this interpretation has two major difficulties .",
    "first , the nucleus would result , in the x - ray band , overluminous with respect to its radio power ( see sec .",
    "the second problem is the extreme flatness of the spectrum . in blazars , where the hard x - ray emission is related to the inverse compton process in the relativistic jet",
    ", it is generally found that @xmath73 for luminosities @xmath74 erg s@xmath7 ( and steeper spectra in the @xmath75 energy band ; see fossati et al .",
    "it has been alternatively proposed that advection dominated disks ( adaf ) could contribute to the x - ray core emission of low power radio galaxies ( sambruna et al .",
    "1999 ) , with a very flat spectral emission ( see e.g. allen et al .",
    "2000 ) , but with a luminosity much lower ( a factor @xmath76 ) than appropriate for our target .",
    "\\2 ) the hard x - ray emission might be produced by inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons within the radio lobes with the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , as detected in a few radio galaxies ( e.g. , feigelson et al .",
    "1995 , tsakiris et al .",
    "1996 ) . a non - thermal power law model with @xmath62 = 2 , gives for the present source a flux @xmath46 4 @xmath77 10@xmath78 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 in the 15 - 200 kev band . using the total radio flux at 4.8 ghz of 1.85 jy ( morganti et al . 1993 ) and the radio spectral index @xmath461 ( otani et al .",
    "1998 ) , the detected x - ray flux would imply a magnetic field of about 0.25 @xmath79 g , i.e. more than an order of magnitude lower than the equipartition value derived from the data published by otani et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . with this low magnetic field",
    ", the relativistic electrons emitting in the radio domain up to 8.87 ghz ( frequency to which the radio spectrum extends , otani et al . 1998 ) would have very high energy , largely sufficient to account for the 15 - 200 kev inverse compton emission .",
    "although there is no firm evidence in the literature that radio sources should be in equipartition conditions , there is also no evidence of such large deviations from it .",
    "therefore , this interpretation seems unlikely .",
    "\\3 ) non thermal x - ray emission from the cluster a  3391 would be expected if relativistic electrons present in the intergalactic medium undergo inverse compton scattering with the photons of the cmb .",
    "this kind of emission has been detected by bepposax in the two clusters coma ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ) and a 2256 ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "2000 ) , where the presence of ultra - relativistic electrons in the intracluster medium is directly demonstrated by the existence of diffuse radio halos .",
    "conversely , no diffuse radio emission is detected in the cluster a 3391 , so the presence of ultra - relativistic electrons in the intergalactic medium remains questionable . in any event , if the hard x - ray emission is of inverse compton origin , the magnetic field must be very weak in order to avoid producing an observable radio halo .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached for the cluster a 2199 , where a marginal detection of hard x - rays above the expected thermal emission is reported by kaastra et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and no diffuse radio halo is observed . for the cluster",
    "a 2199 , kempner & sarazin ( 1999 ) suggest the alternative possibility that the x - ray emission above 20 kev could be due to non thermal bremsstrahlung by a population of suprathermal electrons .",
    "the same interpretation might apply to the present case .",
    "we conclude that , even though reasonable , none of the possibilities that we have analyzed for the interpretation of the pds emission is fully convincing .",
    "more data would be needed to clarify this issue .",
    "we summarize the main results obtained from the bepposax observations and their implications on the properties of these two radio galaxies and their environment .    _",
    "hercules a. _ no relevant variation of temperature and metallicity occurs between the inner and outer regions of the cluster .",
    "however a plasma with two different temperatures seems to be present , perhaps related to the interaction of the radio components with intracluster gas .",
    "it must be borne in mind anyway that the structure of this object is quite peculiar : at optical wavelengths it is classified as a group but its x - ray properties are typical of clusters .",
    "the non thermal emission from the active nucleus appears unabsorbed , as expected for this class of radio galaxies , but brighter than expected by its core radio emission .",
    "this could be related to the peculiar nature of hercules a that shows properties of both fr  i and fr  ii radio galaxies .    _ mrc 0625 - 36 . _",
    "the x - ray luminosity and the values of @xmath19 and @xmath79 are consistent with those expected for this kind of clusters .",
    "the lack of strong variation of the temperature and metallicity across the emitting region suggests that no cooling flow is present , while it could be related to a recent merging process .",
    "the nuclear non thermal emission detected in the mecs and in previous missions is consistent with that expected from radio data , without excluding however some amount of local obscuration .",
    "concerning finally the high energy flux detected in the pds , it seems unlikely that it is related to the cluster or to the radio lobes . on the other hand , a nuclear origin for this emission would imply a luminosity of some units of @xmath80 erg s@xmath7 in the hard band .",
    "either this emission is completely independent of the flux detected at lower energies , or , to fit the rosat , asca and bepposax ( mecs ) data , it must have an very flat spectrum .",
    "the authors thank m. capalbi , f. fiore and s. molendi for their suggestions in the treatment of the mecs observations of extended sources , and g. brunetti , r. fanti , m. hardcastle , r. morganti , p. padovani and f. vagnetti for discussions and comments on the manuscript .",
    "we warmly acknowledge the late daniele dal fiume , for his invaluable help in the treatment of the pds data .",
