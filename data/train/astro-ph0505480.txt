    "the distribution in duration @xcite and hardness @xcite reveals evidence for two distinct populations of classic gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) : long - duration bursts , with typical durations around 30  s and peak energies at @xmath8 kev , and the minority short - duration bursts , with durations of a few hundred milliseconds ( ms ) and harder spectra . despite remarkable progress in understanding the nature and progenitors of long - duration grbs , comparatively little has been learned about the origin of short - hard bursts , primarily because very few such bursts have had rapid and precise localizations .    the modeled bursting rate at redshift @xmath9 of long - soft bursts outnumbers short - hard bursts by about a factor of 3.5 in the batse catalog @xcite ; this assumes the same bursting rate as a function of redshift and does not include the effect of beaming , which , if different for long and short bursts , would imply that the intrinsic relative rates differ from those observed .",
    "while a number of bursts have been triangulated through the interplanetary network ( see @xcite ) on roughly day - long timescales , there has only been one precisely localized short - hard burst relayed to ground observers in less than 1  hr ( grb050202/_swift _ : @xcite ) ; owing to its proximity to the sun at time of localization , sparse groundbased followup was undertaken . including grb050509b , this corresponds to a ratio of 1:18 for short - hard to long - soft burst detections with _",
    "swift _ , much smaller than the batse result .    as with long - duration bursts",
    ", the distribution of short bursts appears very nearly isotropic @xcite , and their brightness distribution ( @xmath10 ) is consistent with being a cosmological population .",
    "still , there is no strong evidence to support the idea that short bursts are preferentially seen from @xmath11 rich abell clusters @xcite , nor are they clearly connected with star formation within @xmath5100 mpc @xcite .    without precise and rapid localizations ,",
    "the population statistics do not provide a strong constraint on the short - burst progenitors .",
    "still , it has been largely reckoned that the leading candidates for short bursts are the merger of a neutron star binary ( ns  ns ; @xcite ) or a black hole ",
    "neutron star binary ( bh  ns ; @xcite ) .",
    "these systems hold several particular attractions . first , although uncertain , the estimated rate of mergers ( between 1.520 per 10@xmath12 yr per galaxy ; @xcite ) is comparable to the short - burst rate @xcite .",
    "second , the dynamical timescale of such mergers is several milliseconds and the sound - crossing times are of order ten milliseconds , comparable to the shortest observed bursts @xcite .",
    "third , compact merger systems are likely to contain enough mass - energy in a transient torus to power short - burst fluences as would be observed if at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "the typical dynamical timescale in such binaries immediately prior to coalescence ( ms ) is much shorter than the observed burst duration , and so it requires the central engine to evolve into a configuration that is stable , while retaining a sufficient amount of energy to power the burst @xcite .",
    "mergers of such compact remnants are by no means the only possible channel to produce short bursts . evaporating primordial black holes",
    "may produce short ( @xmath13 ms ) grbs @xcite , though basic energetics arguments suggest that it would be difficult to see such sources from distances well beyond the galaxy .",
    "the recent discovery of a megaflare from sgr 1806@xmath1420 @xcite led to plausible suggestions that a substantial fraction ( @xmath1540% ) of short bursts could be produced by extragalactic magnetars @xcite .",
    "however , positional @xcite and spectral @xcite arguments have led other workers to suggest that at most a few percent of the batse catalog could consist of short - burst magnetars . note that not all compact mergers create fertile conditions ( a transient torus around a bh ) for making a short burst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the duration of the burst in a compact binary merger is determined by the viscous timescale of the accreting gas , which is significantly longer than the dynamical timescale , thus accounting naturally for the large difference between the durations of bursts and their fast variability @xcite . in the collapsar scenario for long - duration bursts , on the other hand ,",
    "the burst duration is given by the fall - back time of the gas @xcite , which is typically greater than a few seconds .",
    "however , a modified collapsar scenario in which the burst duration is determined not by fall - back but rather by the dynamical timescales associated with the expanding outflow might still meet the constraints of short grbs @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the afterglows of short grbs have been considered by @xcite .",
    "since the peak flux of the prompt emission is comparable for short and long grbs , if their distance scales are similar the isotropic equivalent energy output in gamma rays ( @xmath16 ) would be proportional to the duration of the grb , which is @xmath17 times larger for long grbs .",
    "if the efficiency for producing the gamma rays is comparable , then the isotropic equivalent kinetic energy in the afterglow shock ( @xmath18 ) would have a similar ratio between long and short grbs .",
    "this would imply the afterglow of short grbs to be on average @xmath19 times dimmer in flux than that of long grbs .",
    "the afterglows of short grbs would be even much dimmer than this if they encounter a much smaller external density compared to long grbs ; this is the expectation from short - bursts from binary mergers outside of the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite argued that a low external density would not affect the x - ray band , as the latter was assumed to lie above the cooling - break frequency , @xmath20 .",
    "we find that for a very low external density the electron cooling becomes very slow so that @xmath20 can lie above the x - ray band for the first few days , thus reducing the x - ray flux compared to that for a higher external density typical of the interstellar medium ( ism ) found near star - forming regions of long - duration grbs .    to date the deepest early - time observations ( @xmath21 hr ) yielded upper limits @xmath22 mag from the 0.3  m rotse - i experiment @xcite .",
    "@xcite compiled deeper non - detections at optical and radio wavelengths at times from days to weeks after four short bursts , with the faintest non - detection of @xmath23 mag at @xmath24 hr ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , deep and early observations in search of a short - burst afterglow would require a rapid localization to an uncertainty comparable to the field of view of meter - class ( and larger ) telescopes .",

    "focusing on the bat localization alone , we first consider the probability that a random position in the sky would be in a rich cluster of galaxies ( here we neglect the effects of lensing , expected to be small ; for example , @xcite ) . a reasonable estimate of the covering fraction of clusters on the sky is given by the the dposs northern sky optical cluster survey @xcite .",
    "although this survey is not very deep ( @xmath81 ) , low - redshift clusters should dominate the sky density .",
    "@xcite find a covering fraction of @xmath82 assuming a typical cluster radius of 1  mpc , which suggests a chance alignment is improbable but not impossible .",
    "moreover , the xrt localization of grb050509b to within 45  of the center of such a cluster would occur by chance with a probability of just @xmath83 , but it is difficult to estimate _ a posteriori _ how large a distance from a cluster center one would have considered `` significant . ''    while the gas from the cluster environment may enhance the probability of localizing short - burst afterglows ( see below ) , our expectation is that short grb progenitors are caused by the death of stars of some sort , with the burst rate determined by processes on scales significantly smaller than cluster lengths . to this end , we should consider the chance probability of the grb event occurring at close impact parameter to a galaxy similar to g1 . as reported by @xcite ,",
    "the galaxy g1 has a petrosian @xmath32 magnitude of @xmath84 mag based on imaging by the sdss .",
    "the sky density of galaxies with comparable apparent magnitude brighter than g1 is @xmath85 per square degree @xcite . therefore , the probability of an event randomly occurring within 20  ( about twice the observed offset ) of this bright galaxy is @xmath86 .",
    "we consider this a conservative estimate because this probability makes no reference to the galaxy redshift , type , size , or age ( which are consistent with _ a priori _ discussions of short - burst host galaxies ; e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "if one argues that grb050509b is indeed physically associated with this bright , low - redshift elliptical galaxy , one must consider why the several other well - localized short bursts have not shown similar associations .",
    "the first possibility , that the short bursts arise from a more local population ( as suggested by the magnetar flare from 27 december 2004 ; @xcite ) and grb050509b must therefore arise from a different population , was discounted for four of the best - localized short bursts @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that grb050509b was significantly closer than the other well - localized short bursts .",
    "a strong test of this hypothesis is to determine if other short bursts are associated with more distant clusters or intrinsically bright , massive galaxies ( e.g. , through a deep imaging campaign ) .",
    "the third possibility is simply that short - burst progenitors need not always arise in such galaxies .",
    "in fact , for the ns  ns hypothesis we would expect mergers in galaxies spanning a wide range of hubble types . a delayed bh ",
    "ns merger is also possible , but less likely if grb050509b is associated with g1 : statistically , the distribution of timescales for bh ",
    "ns coalescence is as broad as that for ns ",
    "ns coalescence , albeit quite model dependent @xcite , but the systemic kick velocity is expected to be systematically lower by a factor of a few in most theoretical models of formation of bh ",
    "ns binaries ( kick velocity is roughly inversely proportional to mass , so more massive binaries receive less kick ) . moreover",
    ", larger velocity kicks generally lead to shorter merger times .",
    "thus the @xmath540 kpc offset tends to favor ns ",
    "ns over bh  ns mergers .",
    "while these possible associations are tantalizing , _ a posteriori _ statistics are very suspect . had the grb been near a bright spiral galaxy",
    ", we might have made similar claims based on chance probabilities .",
    "nevertheless , it remains the case that many workers had predicted the distinct possibility that a well - localized compact merger and/or short burst could be near an elliptical galaxy @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and so we suggest that these arguments might reasonably reflect a true association .",

    "* ) of the dichotomy between core - collapse and thermonuclear ( type ia ) supernovae .",
    "only a larger sample of short grbs will provide truly compelling evidence for such a parallel .",
    "still , based on the arguments above , we proceed by accepting the hypothesis that grb050509b is physically associated with g1 .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of g1 with deimos @xcite on the keck  ii 10  m telescope under photometric conditions .",

    "the x - ray luminosity at 10  hr is used as an approximate estimator for the energy in the afterglow shock , since ( a ) at 10  hr the x - ray band is typically above both @xmath123 and @xmath20 so that the flux has a very weak dependence on @xmath124 [ to the power of @xmath125 and no dependence on the external density , both of which have relatively large uncertainties @xcite ; and ( b ) at 10  hr the lorentz factor of the afterglow shock is sufficiently small ( @xmath126 ) so that a large fraction of the jet is visible ( out to an angle of @xmath127 rad around the line of sight ) and local inhomogeneities on small angular scales are averaged out .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the ratio of @xmath121 and @xmath16 is fairly constant for most grbs suggests that both can serve as reasonable measures of the isotropic equivalent energy content of the ejected outflow . a possible caveat to the above statement arises if the observer is in fact not within the aperture of the grb jet ( as is suggested to be the case in both x - ray flashes and x - ray rich grbs ; @xcite ) . in this case",
    "@xmath16 can be significantly smaller than the isotropic equivalent kinetic energy in the afterglow shock , which is better reflected by @xmath128 .",

    "an off - axis interpretation for grb050509b , on the other hand , is unlikely since its x - ray afterglow light curve was observed to decay from a very early epoch ( at @xmath129  s ) .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that grb050509b falls close to the correlation .",
    "the above arguments suggest that the energy in the outflow ejected by grb050509b was @xmath130erg , if it was spherical . on the other hand ,",
    "if it was collimated into a narrow jet of half - opening angle @xmath131 , then the true energy would be smaller by a factor of @xmath132 .",
    "since a significant off - axis viewing angle is not likely , the true energy probably does not exceed @xmath16 .",
    "a higher redshift would increase @xmath16 and with it the estimate for the energy release in this event ; however , it would still remain significantly less energetic than typical long grbs ( see figure  [ fig : lxeiso ] ) .    as also argued by @xcite ,",
    "the fact that the x - ray afterglow luminosity of grb050509b is much smaller than that of long grbs is probably because the event was sub - energetic , rather than due to differences on the values of the external density or the microphysical parameters .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : speclc ] by a fit to the currently available afterglow data using parameter values that are typical for long grbs , except for the isotropic equivalent energy in the afterglow shock , @xmath133 , which is here taken to be equal to @xmath16 assuming @xmath76 .",
    "other parameter values could also give a reasonable description of the rather sparse data . in table",
    "[ tab : theory ] we demonstrate a few different sets of parameters that fit the afterglow data .",
    "again , we refer the reader to @xcite for a more detailed description .",
    "regardless of the redshift , it will be very difficult to detect the afterglow in the radio , since the maximal flux density ( given the observational constraints ) is unlikely to exceed @xmath134jy .",
    "if short grbs occur significantly outside of their host galaxies , as may be common for binary mergers @xcite , then one might expect the external density encountered by the afterglow shock of some grbs to be very low , typical of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , @xmath135 .",
    "this may help explain why some short bursts could have very faint afterglows .",
    "since grb050509b happened to occur near the center of a galaxy cluster where the external density is relatively high , its x - ray afterglow was relatively brighter .",
    "if indeed grb050509b is associated with the galaxy cluster at @xmath136 , then one might expect the external density to be intermediate between the igm and ism : the grb is @xmath137  from the center of the cluster as determined by the x - ray position (   3.4 ) , corresponding to @xmath138 kpc in projection and well within the diffuse emission from the hot intracluster medium gas ( which extends to a radius of @xmath139  mpc ) .",
    "this suggests an ambient density near the position of the grb of @xmath140@xmath141 @xmath142 , though this estimate is uncertain because the space position of the burst relative to the cluster center and the intracluster medium ( icm ) density profile are not known precisely .",
    "the lack of a strong afterglow signature sets grb050509b apart from most other grbs . as a comparison , the low - redshift long - soft burst ( grb030329 , @xmath143 ; @xcite ) , if placed at the redshift of g1 , would have been @xmath144mag at @xmath145  s ; this is approximate 10 mag brighter than the detection limits found herein .",
    "even at @xmath146 , the optical afterglow of a grb030329-like burst should have been detected at early times ( neglecting the effects of dust extinction ) .",
    "our non - detections ( @xmath147 mag ) of variability at 1.3 hr in the what would be the restframe at @xmath87=1 is more than 3.5 magnitudes deeper than the faintest optical tranisent found for a long grb ( 021211 ; @xmath87=1.0 ; see fig .  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of detectable optical / infrared afterglow is not surprising on grounds related to the progenitors and to grb afterglow theory .",
    "first , since the luminosity of long - wavelength afterglows scales with the square root of the ambient density @xcite , events that occur in the ism or igm should be intrinsically fainter ( at optical / infrared wavelengths ) than those occurring in the circumburst environments of collapsars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "second , based on @xmath148 studies , the isotropic - equivalent peak luminosity ( @xmath149 ) of short bursts is similar to that of long bursts @xcite , implying that the total energy output ( @xmath150 duration , with @xmath151 as the conversion efficiency to gamma rays ) is at least an order of magnitude smaller for short bursts . as argued by @xcite , since afterglow brightness scales with @xmath152 , short - burst afterglows would be systematically faint .    now that there is a detected x - ray afterglow we are in a position to directly test the faintness claim , by inferring the gamma - ray energy release and x - ray afterglow luminosity ( a proxy for the kinetic energy in the blast wave ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : lxeiso ] it is clear that this ratio for grb050509b is similar to that found in long - duration grbs .",
    "this is a striking observational bridge to long - duration bursts and suggests a common physical mechanisms for prompt and delayed ( afterglow ) emission for both long - duration and short - duration grbs , even though their progenitors are probably different .",
    "a tentative detection of an afterglow signal by adding up the emission of 76 short batse bursts was reported by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the signal peaked at @xmath153s after the burst trigger with a relatively flat @xmath154 .",

    "we have monitored the location of grb050509b at optical and infrared wavelengths from 8 minutes to 8 days after the trigger and found no indication of variability at the location of the fading x - ray source , the first solid x - ray detection of an afterglow of a short - hard burst . near the location of this source we and others have found an apparent group of faint blue galaxies at redshifts @xmath181 . while it is indeed plausible that this short burst arose from a progenitor connected with those galaxies , we found  based on a positional argument  plausible evidence that the progenitor is likely associated with g1 , a bright elliptical galaxy at @xmath76 . we have argued that the observations find natural explanation with a compact merger system progenitor .",
    "if so , then short - hard grbs provide a bridge from electromagnetic to gravitational wave astronomy : indeed has grb050509b occurred a factor of @xmath53 closer in luminosity distance is might have produced a detectable chirp signal with the next generation ligo - ii gravitational wave facility .    brightening emission from most types of supernovae",
    "would have been seen in our imaging , so the lack of such emission appears inconsistent with the notion that short bursts are due to collapsars or variants thereof .",
    "our afterglow modeling is also consistent with , though does not require , a circumburst medium having lower density than that inferred in long - duration grbs ; if true , this would suggest that the progenitor produces a grb in an environment that is baryon poor compared to that expected for collapsars .",
    "moreover , we have seen no evidence for ongoing star formation in the putative host , so there are likely no remaining massive stars .",
    "given the short active life of a neutron star having a high magnetic field , this also disfavors the magnetar hypothesis .",
    "the non - detection of brightening emission may place limits on the presence of a thermal `` mini - supernova '' from non - relativistic ejecta of a compact merger system @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the small dense mass ( @xmath182 ) ejected during coalescence expands as it is heated by radioactivity of the decompressed ejecta . using the scalings of @xcite and crudely assuming that 10% of the bolometric light at peak is radiated in the @xmath40 band",
    ", the @xmath40-band brightness should peak at observer time @xmath183  d after the burst , with absolute magnitude @xmath184 mag .",
    "assuming that the grb did indeed originate from the redshift @xmath76 , upon inspection of figure [ fig : upper ] , with non - detections at @xmath185 mag at @xmath186  d , we can very roughly exclude @xmath187few @xmath3010@xmath188 . though the @xcite model was intended as a simplistic sketch of the phenomenon , this limit on @xmath182 is somewhat surprising given the amount of escaping non - relativistic material expected in compact mergers @xcite .",
    "indeed , we consider this lack of a `` mini - supernova '' as weak evidence against a @xmath43 origin from a compact merger system .",
    "still , these limits are subject to considerable uncertainty in a number of uncertain parameters of ejecta . for instance , if the velocity of the ejecta were to be @xmath50.01@xmath189 instead of 0.3@xmath189 ( as assumed by @xcite ) then the peak of the thermal emission would occur after about 1 month , and would not have been detected with the current limits .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing that in the ns ",
    "ns or bh  ns progenitor hypothesis for short - hard bursts , the hosts galaxies may be a range of hubble types ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "compact merger systems coalesce in appreciable rates from myr to gyr after a starburst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "obviously , the longer the time since the starburst , the larger the distance a binary system will travel before coalescence .",
    "a clear prediction from this model is that as more short bursts are localized , those associated with later - type galaxies of _ a given mass _ should be preferentially closer to the star - formation centers of the host ; that is , we expect a more concentrated distribution around a spiral galaxy with the same mass as an early - type .",
    "on the other hand , dwarf star - forming hosts have shallow enough potentials that merger systems from these galaxies could coalesce at appreciable distances ( @xmath190kpc ) even shortly after starburst . as _ swift",
    "_ localizes more short - hard bursts , we expect that the offset distribution around galaxies will further elucidate the progenitor question .",
