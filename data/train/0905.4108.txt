    "studies on pairing effects in both nuclear matter and finite nuclei have known intensified interests in the recent years @xcite .",
    "there are two main approaches for pairing , depending whether the mean field is based on gogny finite range interaction or on skyrme interaction . in the first approach , a similar functional",
    "is used in both the particle - hole channel and the pairing channel , although interactions are not exactly the same due to the density dependence of the pairing interaction . in the skyrme approach , the functionals are meant to be different in the two channels , as witnessed for instance by their density dependence .",
    "the use of a different interaction in the particle - hole channel and in the pairing channel has been justified a decade ago @xcite ; this is for instance the case of employing the skyrme interaction in the particle - hole channel and a zero range density dependent interaction in the pairing channel .",
    "we shall focus on the skyrme approach : in this case the pairing density functional is difficult to constrain and it has not been possible to derive an universal pairing interaction during past decades , using for instance the odd - even mass staggering on finite nuclei ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this may indicate the need for another approach , using additional constrains : should the pairing density functional be extended , and are there additional relevant observables to constrain it ?",
    "nuclear matter could help in constraining the pairing functional .",
    "this requires however to bridge nuclei and nuclear matter through lda in the pairing channel : its condition of validity should be more systematically analysed .",
    "it has been recently shown that the two paired neutrons are spatially localised in low density medium which corresponds to the surface of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the same conclusion is drawn by analysing the di - neutron configuration in the excited states @xcite , and also performing calculations in low density matter in @xcite , mainly renewing the possibility to link in some cases the nuclear matter and nuclei in the pairing channel through the lda .",
    "concomitantly the pairing functional has been extended in order to study the condensation of the cooper pairs ( bec - bcs crossover ) in both symmetric and neutron matter . in nuclear matter the medium polarization increases the pairing gap at low densities in symmetric matter , whereas it reduces the gap in neutron matter , indicating an isospin dependence of the pairing functional @xcite .",
    "the application to finite nuclei of extended pairing density functional have shown the relevance of the lda in the pairing channel @xcite .",
    "the pairing functional studies may thus enter in a new era , renewing the method to design the pairing interaction : i ) using an isospin dependence of the pairing interaction ii ) using eventually the nuclear matter as an additional constrain for the pairing interaction iii ) looking for additional observables in nuclei than the odd - even mass staggering to constrain the pairing interaction .",
    "point i ) has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "point ii ) requires the validity of the lda in the pairing channel and shall be addressed in the present work .    in the case of point iii ) an interesting observable is pairing vibrations , measured through two - particle transfer .",
    "it is well known that the transfer cross section crucially depends on the pairing interaction at work in the transferred paired @xcite .",
    "however in the 70 - 80 s the form factor of the transition has never been calculated fully microscopically .",
    "the first microscopic calculations has been performed only recently @xcite , allowing for a strong link between the pairing interaction and pairing vibrations .",
    "several calculations followed @xcite , showing the renewed interest for such studies .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to use pairing vibrations as a complementary observable to the masses , in order to constrain the pairing interaction , and study the implications to the nuclear matter .",
    "more generally , the isospin extension of the pairing interaction should be accompanied with additional constraints .",
    "one purpose of this work is to evaluate if pairing vibrations could play this role ( section iii ) .",
    "the method is to analyse the sensitivity of pairing vibrations to various pairing interactions which provide the same two - neutron separation energy in tin isotopes , and evaluate the consequences on the pairing gap in symmetric and neutron matter . on this purpose",
    "it is necessary to determine the range of density where the lda is valid in the pairing channel ( section ii ) .",
    "after many years of study , there is still no unambiguous universal pairing functional ranging on the whole nuclear chart , and current efforts are aiming in that direction .",
    "the problem may be due to the method used to constrain it , namely comparing the pairing gap with odd - even mass differences , or evaluating the separation energies along a given isotopic chain .",
    "it therefore may be useful to consider a more general context : the evaluation of several pairing interactions constrained by odd - even mass difference , on nuclear matter on one side , and on additional observables on the other side , should shed a renewed light on the problem . to achieve this goal it is first necessary to determine the range of validity of the lda in the pairing channel .",
    "the method is the following : we first consider surface and various mixed paring interactions .",
    "the parameters are determined so as to describe the two neutron separation energy .",
    "then pairing vibrations are used in order to disentangle between the various pairing interactions ( section iii ) .",
    "we choose @xmath0sn and @xmath1sn nuclei : these are spherical nuclei where pairing vibrations are likely to occur @xcite .",
    "one is stable and the second has a large neutron excess .",
    "the microscopic calculations for the ground state are based on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) model .",
    "the skyrme interaction sly4 @xcite is chosen for the particle - hole channel of the hfb equations .",
    "the adopted pairing interaction is the usual zero - range density - dependent interaction @xmath2   \\delta\\left({\\bf r_1}-{\\bf r_2}\\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 provides the surface / volume character of the interaction .",
    "we set @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 . the numerical cutoff for the microscopic calculations is given by @xmath7 mev ( in quasiparticle energies ) and @xmath8= 15/2 .",
    "for each value of @xmath3 , @xmath9 is chosen to fit the known experimental two - neutron separation energies for sn isotopes .",
    "surface and mixed interactions have been considered in this work and the used values of ( @xmath3,@xmath9 ) are listed in table i.    .[inte ] values of @xmath3 and @xmath9 of the pairing interaction . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to disentangle between the various pairing effects , the unperturbed response in the two neutrons addition mode is first shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : g0124 ] for @xmath0sn .",
    "the unperturbed response is built on the hfb single quasiparticle ( qp ) spectrum , for the three pairing interactions .",
    "it should be noted that the spectrum is showed above 10 mev , because there is only the h@xmath10 subshell which can welcome two neutrons to make a low energy state : all the other configurations belong to the next major shell ( see table ii ) , explaining this high energy feature of the spectrum , as stated above .",
    "for all the mixed pairing interaction , the unperturbed spectrum is similar , showing that both the single quasiparticle energy and wave functions are close to each other in that case .",
    "however , in the case of the pure surface pairing , the spectrum is changed .",
    "the energies are shifted to lower values , and the overall strength is increased .",
    "the lower energy shift can be understood by more single qp states located at low energy .",
    "this can be explained by a lower pairing gap and a different energy spectrum found in the hfb self - consistent procedure .",
    "the larger magnitude comes from the wave functions , and will be studied with the qpra response .",
    "it can be already stated that the qrpa response will also have more strength at lower energy , due to this peculiar feature of the unperturbed spectrum for the pure surface pairing force .",
    "[ fig : g0136 ] shows the unperturbed response for the two neutron addition mode in @xmath1sn . in this case , at the beginning of an open neutron shell several low energies configurations can welcome the two neutrons ( see table iii ) . as in the case of @xmath0sn ,",
    "the response exhibits larger strength at low energy in the specific case of the pure surface pairing interaction , compared to others pairing interaction .",
    "this is related to the pairing field profile as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : densi ] . it should be noted that in order to clearly see the effect due to the surface pairing , not only the first 0@xmath11 state , but also the energy area of a few mev above should be explored since the results are different from 0 to 4 mev on fig .",
    "[ fig : g0136 ] .      fig .",
    "[ fig : g124 ] shows the qrpa response for @xmath0sn , with a pure surface and the two mixed interactions .",
    "as expected the residual interaction plays a similar role in all the cases , gathering strength and shifting it to lower energy . in the case of @xmath0sn , a peak around 9 mev",
    "is the strongest for the surface pairing interaction , to be compared with the one around 10 mev for the other interactions .",
    "hence it is expected that the pairing vibration transition strength should be larger in the case of a pure surface force",
    ". however it is known that it is difficult to describe accurately the magnitude of these transitions , especially for absolute cross section calculations @xcite : one - step or sequential two - step process , triton wave function , zero - range or finite - range dwba have to be considered .",
    "it is therefore necessary to rely on the angular distribution , calculated from the form factor , related itself to the pairing transition density @xcite .",
    "the pairing transition density is defined as : @xmath12 where @xmath13= @xmath14 is its time reversed counterpart .",
    "it allows to calculate the form factor in the zero - range dwba approximation .",
    "the pairing transition densities of fig .",
    "[ fig : denst ] show , in the case of @xmath0sn , a difference , going from surface to other modes : the transition density decreases at the surface .",
    "however the difference is not dramatic and may be overruled by the experimental uncertainties .",
    "the larger strength of the 9 mev peak in the pure surface pairing interaction is due to a larger density at the surface .    for the @xmath1sn neutron - rich nucleus",
    ", the low energy spectrum displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig:136 g ] is dramatically changed from using surface to other interactions , on a several mev area .",
    "a three peaks structure appears in the surface case , compared to the 2 peak structure of the other cases .",
    "the integrated strength is also larger in the surface case .",
    "[ fig : x65 ] and [ fig : x1 ] show the corresponding transition densities .",
    "they exhibit very different shapes , comparing results with the pure surface pairing interaction and the mixed pairing interaction .",
    "hence @xmath1sn is a good test case to probe the pairing interaction through pairing vibrations .",
    "for instance in the case of the most intense peak , the central part is dominant in the transition density for the mixed case , whereas the surface part of the transition density dominates in the pure surface interaction .",
    "hence a measurement of the angular distributions associated with the pairing vibration strength in very neutron rich - nuclei such as @xmath1sn seems more decisive to disentangle between the pairing interactions than with @xmath1sn .",
    "this may be due to the larger neutron skin in @xmath1sn , consisting of low density neutron - rich matter .",
    "it has been shown in a previous work how the pairing transition densities allow to calculate the two neutron form factor in order to predict angular distributions for pairing vibrations @xcite .",
    "work along these lines should be undertaken in order to bring additional constrains on the pairing interaction .",
    "the impact of various pairing interactions on pairing vibrations predictions has been analysed for the first time using a hfb+qrpa approach .",
    "they should provide a good sensitivity from a pure surface interaction compared to mixed interactions , especially in the case of very neutron - rich nuclei such as @xmath1sn .",
    "moreover nuclear matter gap calculations show that the lda in the pairing channel is valid in the surface of the nuclei for the @xmath15 mixed surface / volume interaction , but not rigorously valid in other cases . in the case of exotic nuclei , pairing vibrations are found more sensitive to the surface / volume type of the pairing interaction , than in the case of stable nuclei .",
    "this may be due to the larger extension of the neutron density in very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the same study using an isospin dependent pairing interaction will be undertaken .",
    "the hope is to come one step closer to a more global pairing interaction , using odd even mass staggering , pairing vibrations , and nuclear matter as constraints .",
    "experimentally , the pairing transition densities can be tested through the form factor used to calculate the two neutrons transfer cross section .",
    "this implies to use a adequate reaction model .",
    "work along these lines will be undertaken in an near future .",
