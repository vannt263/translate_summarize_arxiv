    "the first indication of a connection between long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) and type ic supernovae ( sne  ic ) was the discovery of a bright sn  ic , sn  1998bw , in spatial and temporal coincidence with the nearby grb  980425 ( @xmath13 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the spectra of sn  1998bw showed broad p - cygni lines of elements such as fe , ca , and si , indicating expansion velocities of @xmath14 .",
    "models of the spectra and the light curve yielded an isotropic equivalent expansion kinetic energy @xmath7@xmath15erg @xcite and an ejected mass @xmath5  @xmath16 , suggesting that sn  1998bw was the highly energetic explosion of a massive stellar core .",
    "the explosion synthesised a large mass of @xmath3ni  for a core - collapse event ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the progenitor of sn  1998bw was probably a very massive star ( m@xmath18 ) , and the remnant very likely a black hole .",
    "sne with broad spectral features , indicative of a large @xmath7 , have been called `` hypernovae '' .",
    "nebular - phase spectra of sn  1998bw were dominated by a strong [ o  i ] 6300 , 6363  emission , as is typical of sne  ic , but they also showed strong lines of [ fe  ii ] , reflecting the high @xmath3ni  production .",
    "another peculiarity was that the [ o  i ] line was narrower than the [ fe  ii ] lines .",
    "this is not expected in the spherically symmetric explosion of a co core @xcite , and was interpreted as the result of the ejection of most @xmath3ni  along a preferential ( polar ) direction in an aspherical explosion @xcite , reminiscent of the collapsar model for grbs @xcite .",
    "doubts were raised about the association of sn  1998bw and grb  980425 because of the unusual weakness of the grb and the apparent presence of an x - ray transient inconsistent in position with the sn @xcite , but the reality of this transient was disproved by observations with both xmm @xcite and chandra @xcite .",
    "the second clear case of association between a grb and a sn was that of grb  030329 and sn  2003dh .",
    "this was also a rather nearby grb ( @xmath19 ) , but in this case it was a normal one .",
    "after extraction from the strong afterglow light , the sn turned out to be very similar to sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "a study of the light curve and the spectra confirmed that sn  2003dh was also a very energetic sn  ic , with overall properties similar to those of sn  1998bw , although perhaps somewhat less extreme ( @xmath7@xmath20erg , @xmath5@xmath21 , m(@xmath3ni)@xmath22 , m@xmath23 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . a late - time spectrum of sn  2003dh also shows a narrow [ o  i ] and broad [ fe  ii ] lines ( bersier et  al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ".    given this evidence , it could be expected that the second closest grb ever detected ( grb  031203 at @xmath0 ) should also reveal sn signatures .",
    "the grb was distinctly weaker than average , but stronger than 980425 .",
    "very strong reddening and a bright galaxy background made the detection of the sn very difficult .",
    "nevertheless , a sn was eventually detected photometrically @xcite and spectroscopically ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mtc04 ) . perhaps not surprisingly , sn  2003lw showed a spectrum similar to those of sne  1998bw and 2003dh .",
    "the determination of the properties of sn  2003lw requires reliable measurements of its light curve and spectra .",
    "this is made difficult by contamination from host galaxy light .",
    "therefore , we have reobserved the field after the sn faded in order to quantify the contribution of the host galaxy and subtract it out properly .    in this paper",
    "we present newly reduced data for sn  2003lw , derive the sn light curve and model it and the spectra . using highly energetic sn  ic models similar to those used for sn  1998bw",
    "we determine the most likely reddening and derive the properties of sn  2003lw .",
    "in order to perform the subtraction of the host galaxy light as accurately as possible , late - time photometry and spectroscopy of the host galaxy were performed on 2004 may 22 ( @xmath24 months after the grb ) with the eso vlt - ut1 ( antu ) and fors2 , at a time when the sn contribution to the total light should be negligible .",
    "the photometry is reported in tab .",
    "[ tb : phot ] .",
    "data reduction and analysis were performed following standard procedures , using the ` eclipse ` and ` gaia ` packages .",
    "the sn aperture photometry was calibrated using new field photometry of several standard fields .",
    "photometric analysis shows only a slight fading ( @xmath25  mag in the @xmath26 band ) with respect to 2004 march ( mtc04 ) .",
    "spectroscopy was performed with grism 150i ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the net exposure time was 45 minutes , and the seeing was @xmath28 .",
    "the data were reduced using standard ` iraf ` routines .",
    "this new `` galaxy only '' spectrum was used to remove the host contribution from a red 150i grism spectrum acquired on 2003 dec 20 , which was not presented in mtc04 because of uncertainties in host galaxy subtraction .",
    "flux calibration was achieved observing two standard stars , ltt3864 and ltt3218 .",
    "consistent results were obtained for the two cases . in order to ensure relative calibration of the spectra of december 2003 and may 2004",
    "we computed the flux of the galaxy emission lines in the different observations and introduced a small correction to make them match exactly .",
    "the entire set of vlt spectroscopic observations of sn  2003lw is reported in tab .",
    "[ tb : spec ] .",
    "in order to derive the properties of sn  2003lw through modelling , it is necessary to construct the bolometric light curve from the observations .",
    "this requires careful subtraction of the host galaxy contribution .",
    "photometry was in fact dominated by the host light , so that the shape and brightness of the reduced sn lc are sensitive to the adopted host brightness .",
    "reliable host photometry can only be obtained when the sn has faded sufficiently .",
    "our new data were obtained sufficiently late that we can assume this is the case .",
    "we adopted as host galaxy magnitudes the @xmath26 and @xmath29 measurements obtained on 2004 may 22 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "these fluxes are both lower than those measured in march in these bands ( mtc04 ) , but the difference is at most @xmath30 , indicating that the sn contributed by no more than 3% to the integrated flux in these bands already in 2004 march ( as a comparison , sn  1998bw became 1 mag fainter over the same time interval , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as for the host @xmath31-band magnitude",
    ", we had to base our estimate on the last available @xmath31-band measurement , which was taken only @xmath32 months after the sn explosion ( @xmath33 , 2004 march 2 ) and is probably still affected by the sn .",
    "we therefore considered that the sn+host magnitude declined by 0.2 mag over the 2 months between late dec 2003 and 2004 mar 2 . a sn  ic similar to sn  1998bw declines by @xmath34mag over that time interval .",
    "this suggests that sn  2003lw still makes a contribution of @xmath32% to the total light on 2004 mar 2 .",
    "therefore we adopted a value @xmath35 .    since nir templates for sn  1998bw are not available , we derived a host magnitude starting from the magnitudes measured in feb 2004 ( mtc04 ) , and corrected them as above assuming that the sn makes a contribution in @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 similar to that in the @xmath31 band .",
    "accordingly , we use host galaxy magnitudes @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "these values are in fair agreement with those reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "one of the major uncertainties in the calibration of the photometry of sn  2003lw is the reddening .",
    "this is large , and may have both a galactic and a host component .",
    "@xcite report for the direction of grb031203/sn  2003lw a galactic extinction @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite note that this value may be highly uncertain and suggest a value @xmath43 as a lower limit .",
    "spectrum synthesis favours a total reddening @xmath44 ( see  5 ) .",
    "this is @xmath45 smaller than the value obtained by @xcite , and is formally consistent with the galactic value of schlegel et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and no host extinction .",
    "lack of significant extinction in grb - host galaxies is indeed often reported ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , following @xcite we adopt @xmath43 and @xmath46 , which results from the difference between @xmath47 and @xmath43 .",
    "given that extinction laws of grb hosts are uncertain and that an smc - type law may be favoured with respect to a milky way - type law ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we computed the intrinsic extinction suffered by the sn light under the 2 assumptions of a mw - type @xcite and an smc - type extinction curve @xcite in the nir and optical ranges . for @xmath46 the difference in the amount of extinction is at most 5% in these wavelength ranges , which is well within our uncertainties",
    ". therefore we adopted a mw extinction curve .",
    "the value of @xmath48 we use here is likely to represent the maximum possible value .    in order to evaluate the bolometric light curve of sn",
    "2003lw we then proceeded as follows .",
    "first , we verified that sne 2003lw and 1998bw have similar spectra .",
    "we constructed the dereddened spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sn  2003lw at every epoch corresponding to an @xmath26 and/or @xmath29-band measurement using the available simultaneous or quasi - simultaneous optical and nir photometry .",
    "we interpolated the dereddened seds of sn  1998bw ( using @xmath49 from @xcite ) to the phases of the seds of sn  2003lw , taking into account the 1.1 time stretch factor .",
    "the seds of sn  2003lw are shown in figure 2 together with the reconstructed seds of sn  1998bw . in order to match the two sne in the optical , the seds of sn  1998bw",
    "were scaled up by a factor 1.3 .",
    "this represents the difference in intrinsic luminosity between the two sne .",
    "since the data of sn  1998bw do not extend to the ir , we extrapolated linearly the red part of the optical sed .",
    "the agreement between the seds of the two sne is very good , except for the @xmath38-band point at the first epoch .",
    "therefore , since the seds of sn  1998bw extend to bluer wavelengths than those of sn  2003lw , the _ `` uvoir '' _ bolometric magnitudes of sn  2003lw were computed by integrating the flux under the sn1998bw templates between rest frame 3600 and 22200 .",
    "the integrated _  uvoir  _ lcs of the two sne are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the lc of sn  2003lw is broader than that of sn  1998bw by a factor of @xmath50 , but it is very similar to it in shape and is more luminous by @xmath2mag .",
    "this is a smaller difference than what was quoted in mtc04 and @xcite , and it is mostly the result of adopting a smaller reddening to sn  2003lw . considering the significant systematic uncertainties ( @xmath51mag from the reddening to both sne , @xmath52mag from possible peculiar velocities affecting the distance to sn  1998bw )",
    "the combined systematic error on the relative luminosity is @xmath53mag .",
    "we based synthetic lc calculations on the 1-d sn lc synthesis code @xcite that was used to model other type ic sne ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the code solves the energy and momentum equations of the radiation plus gas in the co - moving frame , and is accurate to first order in @xmath54 .",
    "electron densities and the electron scattering opacity are determined from the saha - boltzmann equation .",
    "we adopted the approximation proposed by @xcite for the eddington factors , and fitted the tops opacities @xcite to find an empirical relationship between the rosseland mean and the electron scattering opacity .",
    "the energy deposition from radioactive decays was calculated with a gray @xmath55-ray transfer code , assuming an absorptive opacity of @xmath56 @xmath57 g@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55-ray energy source function was evaluated from the latest nuclear data @xcite .    to test the above assumptions as well as other modifications we made to the code , we computed the lc of sn  1998bw using model co138e50 , which fits the spectra and lc of sn  1998bw near the lc peak @xcite .",
    "model co138e50 has @xmath5@xmath58 and @xmath7@xmath59 erg .",
    "we also used the two - component model developed by @xcite .",
    "this model has a denser core than co138e50 to mimic the effect of a 2-d explosion , and thus it can reproduce better the late - time lc of sn  1998bw .",
    "it has @xmath5@xmath60 and @xmath7@xmath61 erg .",
    "we updated the sn  1998bw bolometric lc of @xcite to a distance modulus @xmath62 , corresponding to @xmath63kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 .",
    "both models require a @xmath3ni  mass of @xmath64 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath3ni  is @xmath65 below 5,000 km  s@xmath11 , @xmath66 between 5,000 and 23,000 km  s@xmath11 , and @xmath67 above 23,000 km  s@xmath11  for co138e50 and 0.07 , 0.32 , and @xmath67 in the same three zones for the two - component model .",
    "these values are consistent with those of @xcite , once the difference in the adopted distance is considered .",
    "the early portion of the lc of sn  1998bw is well reproduced by both models ( figure 4 ) . however , as expected , the two - component model fits the late - time lc better than co138e50 , confirming the results of @xcite .",
    "as we showed above , the shapes of the bolometric lcs of sne 1998bw and 2003lw are very similar , but the latter is broader by a factor 1.1 .",
    "it is well known that the time scale of the lc near the peak , @xmath68 , depends on the ejected mass @xmath5 , the kinetic energy @xmath7 , and the opacity @xmath69 as @xmath70@xmath5@xmath71@xmath7@xmath72 @xcite .",
    "since the difference between the two sne is small , we based our calculations on model co138e50 , increasing its density in order to reproduce the broader lc of sn  2003lw .",
    "given the relation above , we increased @xmath5 , and consequently @xmath7 , by a factor 1.2 , leading to @xmath5@xmath73 and @xmath7@xmath74 erg .",
    "we took the mass and the distribution of ejected @xmath3ni  as free parameters , and assumed that the rest of ejecta consists of 90% o and 10% si by mass .",
    "this simplified composition was adopted because the two spectra we have available for modelling are too early to constrain the composition of the bulk of the ejecta , and also because our model is an approximate 1-d reproduction of the probably aspherical ejecta . additionally , we tested the two - component model of sn  1998bw , also scaled up in mass by a factor 1.2 , so that the two - component model for sn  2003lw has @xmath5@xmath75 and @xmath7@xmath76 erg .    modelling the light curve alone",
    "does not yield a unique result : simultaneous modelling of the spectra is required , and this is performed in the next section .",
    "an additional complication in the case of sn  2003lw is the uncertain reddening .",
    "we used a total reddening @xmath47 , derived from spectral models as discussed in section 5 .",
    "the shape of the bolometric lc of sn  2003lw is not much affected by the choice of reddening .",
    "our main model parameters , @xmath5  and @xmath7 , affect the lc shape and do not change for different reddenings .",
    "the overall brightness of course does change , but it can be reproduced using different amounts of ejected @xmath3ni .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the bolometric lc of sn  2003lw and the best - fitting synthetic lcs obtained scaling co138e50 and adjusting the @xmath3ni  distribution .",
    "the total @xmath3ni  mass is @xmath77 . as in the case of sn  1998bw",
    ", we adopted a distribution of @xmath3ni  with an inner zone at @xmath78 km  s@xmath11  and an outer zone between 5,000 and 23,000 km  s@xmath11 , and assumed uniform @xmath3ni  abundance within each zone .",
    "the best - fitting @xmath3ni  distribution is @xmath79 in the inner zone and @xmath80 in the outer zone . unlike the case of sn  1998bw , lack of early photometry phase",
    "makes it impossible to tell whether @xmath3ni  was mixed to the highest velocities , so we did not introduce @xmath3ni  above 23,000 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the synthetic lc of the scaled two - component model is also shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the @xmath3ni  mass in this model is also @xmath81 , of which @xmath82 below @xmath78 km  s@xmath11  and @xmath83 above .",
    "the two - component model fits better than co138e50 after maximum , confirming that the dense core of these models is efficient in absorbing @xmath55-rays and influences the lc after peak . since the @xmath55-ray deposition efficiency is increased by adding the inner dense core , a @xmath3ni  mass similar to that used for the rescaled co138e50 model is sufficient to sustain the higher integrated luminosity of the lcs of the two - component models .    from the above studies",
    ", we can not select between scaled co138e50 and the scaled two - component model .",
    "the synthetic lcs differ before maximum , but we do not know the exact shape of the pre - maximum sn  2003lw lc . also , this phase is very sensitive to the @xmath3ni  distribution .",
    "moreover , the two spectra available are too early to show evidence of a dense core , unlike the cases of other previously studied hne ( sne  1997ef , 1998bw , and 2002ap ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the light curve coverage does not extend to sufficiently late times to apply the 2-component models of @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unfortunately impossible to apply the 2d models of the spectra and the light curve as was possible for sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "we would however expect that since sn  2003lw was similar to sn  1998bw its late time properties would also be best described by a highly aspherical explosion viewed close to the jet axis .",
    "because of the brightness of the host galaxy it was only possible to obtain sn spectra at two epochs near maximum : 2003 december 20 and 30 , corresponding to rest - frame epochs of 16 and 24 days past explosion , respectively . here",
    "we add the red 150i grism vlt spectrum of 2003 dec 20 to the two blue 300v grism spectra shown in mtc04 .",
    "this is useful because it is less sensitive to reddening .",
    "it shows a very strong p - cygni profile , probably a blend of ca  iiir and o  i  7772 , a typical hypernova signature ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "we computed synthetic spectra with our montecarlo code for these two epochs . following the results of the light curve modelling , we used model co138e50 rescaled in mass by a factor @xmath84 .",
    "we did not use the rescaled two - component model , as it only differs in the innermost part , which is not probed by the spectra near maximum .",
    "our models can be used to constrain the total reddening , and have some leverage on the relative galactic and host reddening since the two galaxies are separated by @xmath0 .",
    "we adopted @xmath85 as a lower limit , attributed the remaining reddening to the host , and tested different values of rest - frame @xmath48 .    in figure 6",
    "we show the december 20 spectrum and 4 synthetic spectra , computed for @xmath86 , 0.25 , 0.3 , and 0.35 .",
    "the main input parameters of the models and the properties of the synthetic spectra are summarised in table 3 .",
    "both galactic and host reddening were computed using the @xcite law .",
    "obviously , the model luminosity increases with increasing reddening . in all models",
    "the composition is dominated by oxygen ( @xmath87% by mass ) and neon ( @xmath88% ) .",
    "@xmath3ni  is only @xmath893% by mass , and silicon is even less , @xmath902% .",
    "this composition is slightly different from that used for light curve modelling .",
    "including both ne and o is important for the spectrum synthesis , while the synthetic lc is not significantly affected by replacing ne with o. as reddening decreases , the abundance of @xmath3ni  also decreases , while that of oxygen increases , resulting in a progressively stronger o  i  absorption near 7000 .",
    "all models are very similar in the blue , where the main absorption features are due to fe  ii , co  ii , and ti  ii  lines ( the big trough at 4000 - 4500 ) , and in the @xmath31 region , which is dominated by lines of si  ii  and s  ii",
    ". however , the behaviour in the red , where the strong ca  ii - o  i  p - cygni line shows prominently , is rather different . the model with @xmath86 shows too much absorption in this feature .",
    "this is a consequence of the high abundance of oxygen . in this model , in fact , the abundances of the heavier elements that give rise to the lines in the blue are lower than they are in models with higher reddening , while the abundance of oxygen is higher .",
    "the models with @xmath91 , 0.3 , and 0.35 , all reproduce the ca  ii ",
    "o  i  absorption well , but the model with the highest reddening has a large luminosity , and consequently a large photospheric velocity , so that the spectral lines are too red , and is of lower quality .",
    "models for the december 30 spectrum are shown in figure 7 . because of the smaller wavelength coverage at this epoch , it is not easy to discriminate among the models , all of which look reasonably good .",
    "the input values are listed in table 4 .",
    "the abundances are similar to those used for the december 20 spectrum , but @xmath3ni  ( and decay products ) is reduced by a factor of @xmath89 .",
    "this shows that more @xmath3ni  was produced at higher velocities , contributing to the earlier spectrum , and confirms the scenario of an aspherical explosion .",
    "it is unfortunate that the earliest spectrum is only at peak , otherwise we may have been able to determine more accurately the @xmath3ni  abundance in the outermost , fastest moving layers .",
    "all models fit the blue part of the spectrum nicely , but those with @xmath91 and 0.3 seem to be the best in the o  i - ca  ii  region , at least if we trust the red end of the spectrum . as was the case for the december 20 models",
    ", the oxygen abundance is higher for models with lower reddening , causing the exceedingly strong o  i  absorption near 7200 .",
    "therefore , given our assumed galactic reddening , @xmath85 , we favour a value of the host reddening @xmath92 .",
    "this results in a total reddening of @xmath93 when the redshift of the host is taken into account .",
    "since the total reddening is the quantity that is best constrained by our models , our result is also consistent with the schlegel et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) galactic reddening and no host extinction . with this value of the reddening the absolute magnitude of sn  2003lw on 2003",
    "dec 20 is -19.03 , which is consistent with our lc analysis ( table 3 ) .",
    "the properties of sn  2003lw are very similar to those of the other well - observed grb - sne . given our chosen values of the host reddening , the rescaled explosion model that best fits both the lc and the spectra of sn  2003lw has an @xmath7@xmath94erg , @xmath5  @xmath95 . from the value of @xmath5 ,",
    "the inferred mass of the progenitor of sn  2003lw is @xmath96 .",
    "these values are similar to , although somewhat larger than those of sn  1998bw .",
    "sn  2003lw follows the positive correlation between @xmath7 , m(@xmath3ni ) , and progenitor mass that appears to hold for sne  ic @xcite . as in the case of sn  1998bw ,",
    "sn  2003lw is also likely to have left behind a black hole remnant .",
    "figure 8 shows the time evolution of the photospheric velocity as determined from spectral modelling for the three well - studied grb - sne and for other broad - lined sne  ic that did not show an accompanying grb .",
    "the three grb - sne have the highest values , sn  2003dh being somewhat higher than the other two .",
    "both sne  ic sne  1997ef and 2002ap have much lower photospheric velocities .",
    "it must be stressed that the estimated values of the explosion parameters of sn  2003lw are necessarily approximate .",
    "as we discussed , the estimated peak brightness of the sn , and hence the derived @xmath3ni  mass , depends sensitively on the uncertain galaxy subtraction and the assumed reddening .",
    "moreover , the estimate of @xmath7  is based on spherically symmetric models of the explosion .",
    "if asymmetries were taken into account , most likely in the form af an aspherical explosion , as was possible for the much better studied case of sn  1998bw , it is very likely that the value of @xmath7  would be reduced . in the case of sn",
    "1998bw an estimate based on a spherical model suggested that the true kinetic energy is smaller by about a factor of 5 with respect to @xmath7 , yielding a true @xmath7@xmath97erg @xcite .",
    "such a study was made possible for sn  1998bw by the availability of late - time spectrophotometry , which unfortunately can not be obtained for sn  2003lw since the bright host galaxy outshines the sn .",
    "the relation between the true and isotropic equivalent energies depends sensitively on both the asphericity of the explosion and our viewing angle .",
    "if these were not too different for the three grb - sne , as is likely , then the true @xmath7  of sn  2003lw may be reduced by a similar factor , to @xmath98erg , and that of sn  2003dh to @xmath99erg . even after such a major reduction , the @xmath7  of the three grb - sne remains very large compared to that of typical sne , deserving them the name `` hypernovae '' .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable aspect is that although the properties of the three grb - sne vary by at most @xmath100% , those of the related grbs ( @xmath55- and x - ray energy output ) cover @xmath101 orders of magnitude , grb030329 being almost as energetic as a normal grb , grb031203 a factor of 100 lower , and grb980425 a factor of 100 lower still .",

    "7 ) were computed according to @xmath102 in the above equation @xmath103 is the distance , @xmath104 the fluence , and @xmath105 is the redshift of the grb .",
    "we assumed isotropic emission . since the grbs were detected by different instruments , their fluences ( col .",
    "3 ) refer to different energy ranges . however , these ranges do not differ much , and so we did not reduce the @xmath55-ray fluxes to a common rest - frame energy range .",
    "the properties of the grb - sne are summarized in table 6 .",
    "this conundrum may be interpreted in two ways .",
    "one is that we may be seeing an intrinsically similar phenomenon under different viewing angles .",
    "grb030329/sn2003dh may be viewed almost pole - on , while the orientation of grb980425/sn1998bw may be sufficiently off - axis ( @xmath106 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the detected grb is significantly weaker .",
    "grb031203/sn2003lw may lie somewhere in between @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then the @xmath55-ray properties are a very strong function of angle ( e.g.  @xmath107 . in this scenario , where line - of - sight inclination is a natural free parameter , the optical properties of the sn are not much influenced by this relatively small spread in viewing angles , since the asymmetry in the sn is much less pronounced than it is in the grb @xcite .",
    "larger spectral differences require larger inclination angles and are best seen in the nebular phase @xcite    the other possibility is that there is a dispersion in the properties of the relativistic ejecta for sne with otherwise very similar characteristics .",
    "this may well be , especially if we consider that the relativistic energies at play in the grb phenomenon ( @xmath108  @xmath109erg ) are small compared to the kinetic energy involved in the sn event ( from @xmath110erg for a normal sn to @xmath97erg for a hypernova ) and to the presumably even larger neutrino energies ( @xmath111  @xmath112erg ) , if there is a bounce @xcite .",
    "however , the inferred spread of properties of the sne , albeit only of the order of @xmath113% , is seen not only in @xmath7  and @xmath5 , but also in less orientation - dependent quantities such as the mass of @xmath3ni , and therefore it is almost certainly real .",
    "most likely both intrinsic differences and orientation effects are present .",
    "so , while the observed @xmath55-ray energy of grb980425 was so low that it may require an intrinsically weak grb with normal spectral properties , the true energy may be higher than estimated since the grb was viewed off - axis as suggested by sn nebular line profile studies .    the case of grb031203",
    "is similarly uncertain : based on its x - ray to @xmath55-ray flux ratio , it was reported to be an xrf @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that it is a classical grb based on the shape of the @xmath55-ray spectrum .",
    "based on radio calorimetry and the absence of the signature of an off - axis afterglow , @xcite and @xcite suggest that it is an intrinsically underluminous event . however , @xcite model the event as a standard - energy , off - axis grb . since nebular - phase spectra of sn2003lw are not available , it is unfortunately impossible to estimate the geometry of the explosion and the viewing angle .",
    "although it is now clear that long - duration grbs and energetic , broad - lined sne  ic ( hypernovae ) are related @xcite , the physical link between the relativistic event and these sne remains uncertain .",
    "further uncontroversial occurrences of grb - sn association will hopefully clarify the issue .",
