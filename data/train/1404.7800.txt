    "<S> * electron - like carriers in bismuth are described by the dirac hamiltonian , with a band mass becoming a thousandth of the bare electron mass along one crystalline axis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of three anisotropic valleys offers electrons an additional degree of freedom , a subject of recent attention  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we map the landau spectrum by angle - resolved magnetostriction , and quantify the carrier number in each valley : while the electron valleys keep identical spectra , they substantially differ in their density of states at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the electron fluid does not keep the rotational symmetry of the lattice at low temperature and high magnetic field , even in the absence of internal strain . </S>",
    "<S> this effect , reminiscent of the coulomb pseudo - gap in localized electronic states , affects only electrons in the immediate vicinity of the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> it presents the most striking departure from the non - interacting picture of electrons in bulk bismuth . *    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     a naturally occurring element known since ancient times  @xcite , the semi - metal bismuth has played an important role in the history of solid state physics  @xcite . over the last five years </S>",
    "<S> , bismuth has attracted new attention focused on its unusual properties in the presence of a strong magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> more than 120 years after the first discovery of the nernst - ettingshausen effect ( ne ) in the very same material  @xcite , giant ne oscillations were observed in the vicinity of the quantum limit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this limit is attained when the magnetic field is strong enough to confine carriers to their lowest landau level(s ) . with currently available magnetic fields , it is only accessible in solids with a carrier concentration as low as in bismuth </S>",
    "<S> . theory expects a prominent role for electron interactions beyond this limit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ne measurements extended to 33 t , well above the quantum limit  @xcite , found features unexpected in the single - particle picture . </S>",
    "<S> torque magnetometry studies by li _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite up to 31 t showed a structure in magnetization with hysteresis suggesting a correlation - induced phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> these results inspired new theoretical studies of the landau spectrum in bismuth  @xcite , which is remarkably complex because the electron dispersion is dirac - like , with an additional anisotropic zeeman term  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the vicinity of the high - symmetry axis known as the trigonal axis , the magnetic field at which an electron landau level is depleted rapidly changes with the field orientation . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the angle - resolved landau spectrum was determined by ne measurements for the whole solid angle  @xcite , and found to be in good agreement with theoretical calculations by fuseya  @xcite , based on an earlier model by vecchi and co - workers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the non - interacting picture can successfully explain most features of the high - field phase diagram , including those previously attributed to electron interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still the unexpected hysteresis seen in the torque measurements  @xcite , reminiscent of a first - order phase transition , remained unexplained . </S>",
    "<S> however , subsequent torque magnetometry studies  @xcite failed to reproduce this hysteresis and found no evidence of the suspected high - field phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> most recently , a new experiment by zhu _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ refueled the suspicions of possible interaction effects in bismuth : the magnetoconductivity tensor in bismuth was shown to spontaneously lose the threefold rotational symmetry of the underlying lattice at low temperature and high magnetic field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior , which is not related to the previously reported hysteresis , is again unexpected in the non - interacting picture and suggests a type of electronic order involving the valley degree of freedom and favored by electron - electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , a possible role of internal strain , which could lift the valley degeneracy , could not be ruled out  @xcite .    in the context of this lively discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we revisit another historical experiment on bismuth : oscillatory magnetostriction  @xcite . employing a new miniaturized capacitance dilatometer with sub-@xmath0 resolution  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we establish the angle - resolved landau spectrum with exceptional clarity , in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations  @xcite , and again with no trace of hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> this observation clearly excludes the existence of a thermodynamic first order phase transition at high fields and in the tilt angle range studied by li _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we find compelling evidence for spontaneous valley imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to transport  @xcite , the thermodynamic probe employed in this study directly couples to the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for the first time our experiment establishes that while two distinct valleys keep identical landau spectra , they present a different density of states at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> this rules out the possibility that uncontrolled strain is responsible for lifting the valley degeneracy and sets boundaries on the possible theoretical scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we will argue that the situation is reminiscent of the coulomb gap in doped semiconductors , where coulomb interaction induces a soft gap in the density of states  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we measured magnetostriction with a miniaturized capacitance dilatometer  @xcite illustrated in fig.[fig1]a and explained in detail in the supplement . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in fig.[fig1]c ( top panel ) , the magnetic field dependent length change @xmath1 measured at @xmath2 k , with the field @xmath3 applied along the trigonal axis , clearly shows angle - dependent oscillatory features . at low fields , @xmath4-perodic quantum oscillations </S>",
    "<S> were observed down to fields as low as @xmath5 t  @xcite , and the period of , corresponding to the maximum cross - section of the hole fermi pocket , is identical to results obtained from oscillatory resistivity  @xcite and oscillatory ne  @xcite . with increasing field , </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations become more pronounced , leading to the last and most prominent resonance at 9 t , clearly visible on top of the monotonous background in fig.[fig1]c . </S>",
    "<S> this field represents the quantum limit of holes .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetostriction is linked to the stress dependence of the magnetization via a maxwell relation  @xcite . in a compensated semi - metal , </S>",
    "<S> bismuth in particular , magnetostriction is generated by a field - dependent variation of electron and hole concentrations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetostrictive strain is a linear function of the field - induced change in carrier density @xmath6@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when the magnetic field is applied along the trigonal axis , the longitudinal magnetostriction is simply : @xmath7 the magnitude of the coefficient @xmath8 is determined by a product of components of elastic compliance and deformation potential tensors . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic compliance links elastic energy to strain , and the deformation potential tensor quantifies the strain required for shifting a band edge . </S>",
    "<S> ( see the supplement for a more detailed discussion ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetostriction coefficient @xmath9 thus represents the derivative of the carrier number with respect to the magnetic field : @xmath10    the applied magnetic field further quantizes the quasiparticles energies into highly degenerate landau levels ( lls ) which occupy discrete energy levels depending on the cyclotron energy perpendicular to the magnetic field direction @xcite . as the cyclotron energy increases with increasing field , </S>",
    "<S> the higher energy lls become depopulated . above the quantum limit of 9 t </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticles are confined to the lowest ll . </S>",
    "<S> the density of states ( dos ) has a series of singularities @xmath11 , as sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b .    </S>",
    "<S> the spikes seen in @xmath12 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c , bottom panel ) are therefore caused by the sudden changes in the carrier number whenever a ll is evacuated and they reflect the asymmetric singularities in the dos . according to calculations  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the change in the total carrier number ( of both holes and electrons ) is much more drastic for the evacuation of a hole than an electron ll . in agreement with the implications of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq2 ] , we find that hole peaks in our magnetostriction data ( fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1]c ) are significantly more prominent than electron peaks .    </S>",
    "<S> approaching the quantum limit , only a few levels remain occupied , and an increasing fraction of the total electrons are concerned by each ll evacuation . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the total dos therefore becomes more significant . </S>",
    "<S> since the electric charge is to be conserved , in a single - band metal the carrier concentration remains fixed and only the chemical potential shifts after each evacuation , to satisfy the change in dos . </S>",
    "<S> in a compensated system like bismuth , the situation is different . </S>",
    "<S> while the total number of holes should match the total number of electrons , a simultaneous change in both hole and electron concentrations can take place if it reduces the free energy . </S>",
    "<S> sweeping the magnetic field thus leads to a change @xmath13 in carrier concentration , and a corresponding shift in band edges . </S>",
    "<S> the cost in the elastic free energy is compensated by the decrease in the overlap between conduction and valence bands  @xcite .    to establish the angle - dependent ll spectrum for electrons and holes , we measured the magnetostriction at various tilt angles @xmath14 of the field in the trigonal - binary plane ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> oscillatory features from the subsequent depletion of landau levels , already visible in the raw @xmath15 data in fig.[fig1]c , are clearly discernible as resonances in the derived magnetostriction coefficient @xmath16 .     plane . </S>",
    "<S> * color map plot of the measured magnetostriction coefficient @xmath12 versus tilt angle @xmath14 and magnetic field @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the color coding is arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> the black lines are guides to the eye , linking the observed peaks to corresponding electron and hole pockets of the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> additional labels indicate the ll and spin index . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical lines serve as a reference for fig.[fig3]b . ]    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] shows a color map plot of @xmath12 vs. @xmath3 and @xmath14 , obtained from the angle - dependent measurements in fig.[fig1]c . </S>",
    "<S> the black lines serve as guides to the eye to highlight the measured resonances in @xmath12 , and the different line styles relate the resonant features to the three electron pockets or the hole pocket of the bismuth fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> the additional labels @xmath17 next to the lines indicate the ll index @xmath18 and spin @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that the smaller peaks associated with electron lls in bismuth can be resolved in a magnetostriction measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the peak positions for the electron lls are in good agreement with theoretical calculations by alicea and balents  @xcite , whereas the hole spectrum is better described by the calculations by y. fuseya in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the horizontal line at 8 t in fig .  [ fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> is attributed to the @xmath20-resonance of electron pocket e2 ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) , which even at @xmath21 appears at a lower field than the corresponding peaks of the other two electron pockets . </S>",
    "<S> we explain this mismatch by a slight misalignment , where the field at @xmath21 is not perfectly aligned with the trigonal axis , but tilted towards the bisectrix axis by an estimated @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> our data do not show any of the additional , theoretically unexpected , lines observed in ne measurements at 13.3 , 22.3 , and 30.8 t  @xcite . according to a recent interpretation , these anomalies were caused by the presence of a secondary twinned crystal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have no reason to assume that our bismuth crystal is completely free of such defects , but our landau spectrum does not show the associated anomalies , probably due to the small volume fraction occupied by secondary twins . since magnetostriction is a bulk measurement dominated by the principal crystal domain , the presence of such minority domains can likely not be detected . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we did not observe any hysteresis in contrast to torque measurements  @xcite , despite carefully looking for it at similar angles and magnetic fields ( see fig . s2 b in the supplementary information ) . together with the torque magnetometry results in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this is strong evidence against a possible first - order phase transition inferred from the previous work by li </S>",
    "<S> _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in summary , </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm the validity of the one - particle picture in describing the complex angle - resolved landau spectrum of bismuth near the trigonal axis , a conclusion shared by a recent study of angle - resolved ne effect in the whole solid angle  @xcite .    the most important result of this study is presented in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ fig3 ] , in which @xmath3-dependent measurements of @xmath12 at positive ( orange ) and negative ( blue ) tilt angles @xmath14 are plotted side by side . as illustrated in panel c , the band edges for the hole pocket or electron valley 2 are insensitive to this tilt direction , and the corresponding peaks should appear symmetrically at the same fields , independent of the sign of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the other resonances associated with the two electron valleys 3 ( or 1 ) are expected to shift upward ( or downward ) for positive ( or negative ) @xmath14 , and measurements at opposite signs of @xmath14 can be used to directly compare these two valleys . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all peaks associated with electron valley 3 are significantly larger than the peaks from electron valley 1 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( panel b ) measurements at @xmath23 are compared on a linear scale , showing a difference of of the total peak height between valleys 1 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the monotonous background as well as all other resonances originating from electron valley 2 or the hole pocket produce identical values for positive and negative @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore exclude instrumental effects , like a general angle - dependence of the dilatometer sensitivity , as the possible cause for the observed anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> also a slight rotation of the sample in the binary - bisectrix plane can be ruled out considering the near - perfect mirror - symmetry of the peak positions ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> discussion in the supplement ) . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks in @xmath12 , corresponding to the differential density change @xmath24 , reflect the singularities in the dos whenever a ll passes the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> our observation of different peak heights for different valleys can therefore be interpreted as a valley - dependent density of states close to the depletion of a landau level . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first thermodynamic evidence for the loss of three - fold symmetry by the electron fluid at low temperature .     vs. @xmath3 , comparing measurements at positive ( orange ) and negative ( blue ) tilt angles @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> peaks are labeled with their valley index , ll and spin quantum numbers . </S>",

    "<S> a previous study of magnetoconductivity in bulk bismuth with a magnetic field rotating in the binary - bisectrix plane also reported a spontaneous loss of threefold symmetry in the magnetoresistance data  @xcite , which could be a related effect . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss various scenarios that could lead to these observations . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest possible explanation is experimental . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry breaking may arise due to frozen - in strains and/or the sample can become asymmetrically strained upon cooling . </S>",
    "<S> uniaxial stress is known to drastically imbalance the valley population in bismuth  @xcite , so could the observed loss of threefold symmetry simply be a consequence of uncontrolled strain , as suggested in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ? </S>",
    "<S> our experimental observation clearly rules out the possible role of uncontrolled strain . </S>",
    "<S> if valley degeneracy were lifted by strain , an unequal occupation of the electron valleys would be observed . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that not only the amplitude of the background but also the peak positions remain almost perfectly symmetric between positive and negative angles . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the two valleys remain identical in size , but differ only in their dos at the fermi level </S>",
    "<S> .    another obvious cause of a broken threefold symmetry would be secondary twinned crystals , which already led to the puzzling observation of additional lines in the angle - dependent ne spectrum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our magnetostriction measurements do not show any such features . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the primary crystal domain is the exclusive source of the measured magnetostriction signal . </S>",
    "<S> while we can not rule out the presence of secondary twinned crystals in our sample , these defects could not possibly cause such large differences as @xmath31 % in the peak heights of our main landau spectrum , if they are otherwise undetectable .    to summarize , our magnetostriction data finds no measureable difference between the valleys regarding their total occupation , but a sizeable difference in the dos at the fermi level . at first sight </S>",
    "<S> , this appears paradoxical . </S>",
    "<S> but in each landau tube , states at the fermi level only constitute a small fraction of all carriers . </S>",
    "<S> apparently the experimentally observed valley imbalance only affects these carriers .    </S>",
    "<S> having ruled out the evident possibilities of strain and secondary twinned crystals as causes of the observed symmetry breaking , interactions among electrons could be considered responsible for the valley - dependent density of states . a suppressed dos at the fermi level is frequently observed in correlated systems . </S>",
    "<S> one well - known example is the coulomb pseudogap in disordered semiconductors  @xcite , where long - range interactions between electrons lead to a soft depletion in the density of localized states at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> for such a coulomb - gap to become valley - selective , the isotropic coulomb interaction would have to be combined with a source of anisotropy , like an anisotropic distribution of defects in the bismuth crystal , offering electrons an unequal number of localized states along the symmetry axes . </S>",
    "<S> while no real crystal has an exactly equal defect density along all crystalline axes , we can not quantify the exact difference for our sample .    </S>",
    "<S> another well - documented source of anisotropy is the effective mass itself , which for electrons in bismuth differs by a factor of 200 along the binary and bisectrix axis , respectively  @xcite . due to this extreme mass anisotropy , abanin _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite already suspected that valley nematicity - a theoretical scenario proposed for multiple - valley quantum hall systems with significant mass anisotropy such as alas - might be relevant for bismuth , too . </S>",
    "<S> valley nematicity occurs when electrons reduce the rotational symmetry of the crystal by unequally occupying equivalent valleys . </S>",
    "<S> according to abanin _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , if the mass anisotropy in a two - dimensional system is large enough , the exchange energy will favor such an inequality . </S>",
    "<S> zhu _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggested this scenario as a possible explanation for the symmetry breaking they observed in the magnetoconductivity , which was met by the objection that the theory developed for quantum hall systems refers explicitly to a two - dimensional system without the kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> how can it be applied to bulk bismuth , in which electrons keep a finite energy even in the presence of landau quantization ? </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a possible answer to this theoretical objection as well : the imbalance between the two valleys emerges only when a ll is evacuated , which is when the kinetic energy of the electrons along the @xmath3 direction vanishes ( center of the parabolic dispersion sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) . in the absence of kinetic energy , </S>",
    "<S> theoretical considerations on the energetics of valley nematicity in a two - dimensional system  @xcite become relevant to bulk bismuth as well .    our context of investigation is different from both disordered semiconductors and multiple - valley quantum hall systems , but our experimental observation points to a modification of the fine structure of the dos at the fermi level , presumably by interaction , which is not identical between the three valleys . </S>",
    "<S> this frames a specific challenge to theory . </S>",
    "<S> the link between electron correlation and valley imbalance in the specific case of @xmath32 symmetry in a three - dimensional context begs a thorough theoretical investigation . </S>"
