    "if a higgs boson is discovered and its mass measured , the higgs potential of the standard model can be uniquely determined .",
    "on the other hand , supersymmetry is at present the only known framework in which the higgs sector of the standard model ( sm ) , so crucial for its internal consistency , is natural  @xcite .",
    "the minimal version of the supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains two higgs doublets @xmath19 with opposite hypercharges : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , so as to generate masses for up- and down - type quarks ( and leptons ) , and to cancel gauge anomalies . after spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the neutral components of @xmath22 and @xmath23 obtaining vacuum expectation values , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , the mssm contains two neutral @xmath0-even - even higgs particles as @xmath1 and @xmath3 . ] ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) , one neutral @xmath0-odd ( @xmath5 ) , and two charged ( @xmath27 ) higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "although gauge invariance and supersymmetry fix the quartic couplings of the higgs bosons in the mssm in terms of @xmath28 and @xmath29 gauge couplings , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , there still remain two independent parameters that describe the higgs sector of the mssm .",
    "these are usually chosen to be @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the mass of the @xmath0-odd higgs boson .",
    "all the higgs masses and the higgs couplings in the mssm can be described ( at tree level ) in terms of these two parameters .    in particular , all the trilinear self - couplings of the physical higgs particles can be predicted theoretically ( at the tree level ) in terms of @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "once a light higgs boson is discovered , the measurement of these trilinear couplings can be used to reconstruct the higgs potential of the mssm .",
    "this will go a long way toward establishing the higgs mechanism as the basic mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories .",
    "although the measurement of all the higgs couplings in the mssm is a difficult task , preliminary theoretical investigations by plehn , spira and zerwas @xcite , and by djouadi , haber and zerwas @xcite ( referred to as ` dhz ' in the following ) , of the measurement of these couplings at the lhc and at a high - energy @xmath11 linear collider , respectively , are encouraging .    in this paper we consider in detail the question of possible measurements of the trilinear higgs couplings of the mssm at a high - energy @xmath11 linear collider .",

    "the trilinear higgs couplings that are of interest are @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath37 , involving both the @xmath0-even ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) and @xmath0-odd ( @xmath5 ) higgs bosons .",
    "the couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 are rather small with respect to the corresponding trilinear coupling @xmath38 in the sm ( for a given mass of the lightest higgs boson @xmath39 ) , unless @xmath39 is close to the upper value ( decoupling limit ) .",
    "the coupling @xmath37 remains small for all parameters .    throughout",
    ", we include one - loop radiative corrections @xcite to the higgs sector in the effective potential approximation .",
    "in particular , we take into account the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath40 , the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear parameter and the bilinear higgs(ino ) parameter in the superpotential , respectively , and as a consequence the left  right mixing in the squark sector , in our calculations .",
    "we thus include all the relevant parameters of the mssm in our study , which is more detailed than the preliminary one of dhz .    for a given value of @xmath39",
    ", the values of these couplings significantly depend on the soft supersymmetry - breaking trilinear parameter @xmath5 , as well as on @xmath40 , and thus on the resulting mixing in the squark sector .",
    "since the trilinear couplings tend to be small , and depend on several parameters , their effects are somewhat difficult to estimate .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the higgs sector of the mssm , including the radiative corrections to the masses .",
    "the trilinear couplings are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we review the possible production mechanisms for the multiple production of higgs bosons through which the trilinear higgs couplings can be measured at an @xmath11 linear collider . in section 5 we consider the dominant source of the multiple production of the higgs ( @xmath1 ) boson through higgs - strahlung of @xmath3 , and through production of @xmath3 in association with the @xmath0-odd higgs boson ( @xmath5 ) , and the background to these processes .",

    "we present , based on our calculations , the regions of the mssm parameter space in which the trilinear couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 could be measured ; finally , in section 9 we present a summary of our results and conclusions .",
