    "to solve the fine - tuning problem of the standard model ( sm ) , the little higgs theory @xcite was proposed as a kind of electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism accomplished by a naturally light higgs sector .",
    "the higgs boson remains light , being protected by the approximate global symmetry and free from one - loop quadratic sensitivity to the cutoff scale .",
    "the littlest higgs model @xcite provides an economical approach which implements the idea of the little higgs theory .",
    "most of the constraints from the electroweak precision tests on little higgs models@xcite come from the tree - level mixing of heavy and light mass eigenstates , which would require raising the mass of the new particles to be much higher than tev scale and thus reintroduce the fine - tuning in the higgs potential @xcite .",
    "however , these tree - level contributions can be avoided by introducing a discrete symmetry called t - parity @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , the top quark has a t - even partner ( denoted as @xmath6 ) and a t - odd partner ( denoted as @xmath7 ) . as a result ,",
    "the top quark interactions are altered with respect to the sm predictions , which will manifest in various top quark processes . in this work",
    ", we will examine such effects in the associated @xmath5 productions at the lhc and ilc , and also study the @xmath8 and @xmath2 productions at the lhc ( due to the heaviness of @xmath6-quark , @xmath1 is beyond the threshold of the ilc ) .    the reason for studying @xmath3 production as a test of the littlest higgs model with t - parity is obvious .",
    "firstly , the large top quark yukawa coupling is speculated to be sensitive to new physics and the @xmath3 productions may be a sensitive probe of the littlest higgs model with t - parity . in this model",
    "the top quark yukawa coupling has a deviation from the sm prediction , which will affect the @xmath3 productions .",
    "also the t - quark can contribute to the @xmath3 productions through its virtual effects .",
    "secondly , @xmath3 production will be first searched at the lhc and can be precisely measured at the ilc @xcite . at the ilc",
    "the top - quark yukawa coupling can be measured with an accuracy of about @xmath9 through the production of @xmath0 @xcite and the polarized beams can further improve the measurement precision @xcite .",
    "the precision measurements of @xmath3 production make it possible to unravel the new physics effects in this process .",
    "in addition , the new production channel at the lhc , the @xmath1 or @xmath2 productions , should also be considered since they give the same final states as @xmath3 production due to the dominant decay @xmath4 . as will be shown from our study , compared with @xmath10 production",
    ", this new production channel can have a sizable production rate for a @xmath6-quark below tev scale .",
    "such a production will be counted into @xmath0 events or possibly extracted from @xmath3 events , depending on if we can distinguish the @xmath6-quark from the top quark from mass reconstructions .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we recapitulate the littlest higgs model with t - parity . in sec .",
    "iii and sec .",
    "iv we study the @xmath10 productions at the ilc and lhc , respectively . in sec .",
    "v we study the new @xmath1 or @xmath2 production channel at the lhc . finally , we give our conclusion at sec . vi .",
    "before our calculations we recapitulate the littlest higgs model with t - parity @xcite . the gauge sector of this model can be simply obtained from the usual littlest higgs model @xcite .",
    "t - parity acts as an automorphism which exchanges the @xmath11_{1}$ ] and @xmath11_{2}$ ] gauge factors . before electroweak symmetry breaking , the gauge boson mass eigenstates have the simple form @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are @xmath15 and @xmath16(j=1,2 ) gauge fields .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the @xmath19 gauge bosons and have even t - parity , whereas @xmath20 and @xmath21 are additional heavy gauge bosons and have odd t - parity .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the new mass eigenstates in the neutral heavy sector will be a linear combination of @xmath20 and @xmath21 gauge bosons , producing @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath22 is typically the lightest t - odd state and may be a candidate of dark matter . due to t - parity , the new gauge bosons do not mix with the sm gauge bosons and thus generate no corrections to precision electroweak observables at tree level .",
    "the top quark sector contains a t - even and t - odd partner , with the t - even one mixing with top quark and canceling the quadratic divergence contribution of top quark to higgs boson mass .",
    "the masses of the t - even partner ( denoted as @xmath6 ) and the t - odd partner ( denoted as @xmath7 ) are given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the electroweak breaking scale ( @xmath26 gev ) , @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the coupling constants in the lagrangian of the top quark sector @xcite , and @xmath30 .",
    "the mixing of @xmath6-quark with the top quark will alter the sm top quark couplings and induce the couplings between @xmath31 and @xmath6 @xcite , which are given by @xmath32,\\\\ v_{ht\\bar{t}}&= &    -\\frac{m_{t}}{v}\\left(1-\\frac{3 + 2r^{2}+3r^{4}}{4(1+r^{2})^{2 } } \\frac{v^{2}}{f^{2}}\\right ) , \\label{htt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the @xmath35 coupling involved in our calculations",
    "will also be different from the sm coupling , which is given by @xmath36 in the littlest higgs model with t - parity , the t - quark can decay into @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , among which the decay @xmath4 is the most important channel @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "12 of @xcite , @xmath41 is over 46% for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "when @xmath44 is 500 gev , @xmath41 can be over 50% . for comparison , the subdominant decay @xmath45 can have a branching ratio of about @xmath46 at most in the parameter space for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "now we look at the process @xmath48 in the littlest higgs model with t - parity .",
    "the feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "1 . in the sm",
    "it proceeds mainly through the @xmath49-channel @xmath50 and @xmath51 exchange diagrams with the higgs boson radiated from the top quark , as shown in fig.1(a , b ) .",
    "although a contribution can also come from the diagram fig.1(e ) with the higgs boson radiated from the gauge boson @xmath51 , such a contribution is relatively small . in the littlest higgs model with t - parity",
    "we have additional diagrams fig.1(c , d ) mediated by the @xmath6-quark . due to the t - parity , other new particles , such as new heavy gauge bosons @xmath23 and @xmath22 ,",
    "do not participate in this process .",
    "we calculate the cross section numerically by monte carlo simulation .",
    "the cross section in the littlest higgs model with t - parity depends on two free parameters : the symmetry breaking scale @xmath44 and the ratio @xmath27 . considering the electroweak precision constraints @xcite , we vary them in the range @xmath52 and @xmath53 gev@xmath54 tev .",
    "the sm parameters involved are taken as @xmath55 gev @xcite , @xmath56 gev , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 gev @xcite .",
    "energy is assumed to be @xmath60 gev .",
    "considering the polarization of the initial electron and positron beams , the cross section of @xmath61 is given by @xcite @xmath62,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the cross section for right - handed @xmath64 beam ( @xmath65 ) and left - handed @xmath66 beam ( @xmath67 ) , and other cross sections @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are defined analogously .",
    "as in @xcite , we assume @xmath71 and @xmath72 in our calculations .    in fig .",
    "2 we plot some contours for the deviation from the sm cross section in the plane of @xmath73 versus the symmetry breaking scale @xmath44 . for comparison",
    "we also show the corresponding results for unpolarized beams .",
    "we see that the polarized beams lead to more sizable deviation and thus make the collider more powerful in probing such new physics effects .",
    "2 shows that the contributions of this model decrease the sm cross section in the allowed parameter space , and the magnitude of such correction depends on the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath44 .",
    "the corrections are more sizable for lower values of the scale @xmath44 , and in a large part of the parameter space the contributions can alter the sm cross section over @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath44 is lower than 1 tev , the corrections can be over @xmath74 in magnitude .",
    "so far the electroweak precision data constrained the parameter space of @xmath73 and @xmath44 .",
    "but , as studied in @xcite , such constraints depend on additional parameters , i.e. , the masses of extra t - odd fermions and the parameter @xmath75 whose value is dependent on the details of the uv physics .",
    "therefore , we did not show these electroweak precision constraints in fig .",
    "another remarkable feature of our results is that the corrections are very sensitive to the scale @xmath44 , but not so sensitive to the parameter @xmath73 when @xmath73 is larger than about 2 , as shown in fig .",
    "this means that we can use this process to determine or constrain the scale @xmath44 if @xmath73 is large .    in fig .",
    "2 we also plotted the @xmath76 statistical significance , obtained by assuming an luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath77 and an efficiency of @xmath74 for events counting ( due to kinematical cuts and b - tagging , etc . ) .",
    "we see that a large part of parameter space is within the @xmath76 statistical sensitivity . of course",
    ", we should note that some inevitable systematic error will worsen the probing limits .",
    "detector - dependent monte carlo simulations are necessary in order to figure out the more practical probing limits .",
    "note that in the littlest higgs model without t - parity , the new neutral gauge bosons @xmath23 and @xmath22 can also contribute to the process @xmath48 at tree - level via @xmath49-channel resonances @xcite . in this case , the large values of @xmath44 required by the precision electroweak data suppress the contributions of these new particles and , as a result , the t - quark effects are very small .",
    "however , in the littlest higgs model with t - parity considered in this work , t - parity forbids the tree - level contributions of the new gauge bosons @xmath23 and @xmath22 to the process since they are t - odd .",
    "thus in this scenario only the t - quark with even t - parity can contribute to the process at tree - level and due to the relaxed constraint on @xmath44 ( as low as 500 gev is still allowed ) , such t - quark effects may be sizable .",
    "( however , we noticed that there is an alternative implementation of the t - parity @xcite , in which all new particles which cancel the quadratic divergence of higgs mass are t - odd , including the top - quark sector .",
    "thus , there is no t - quark with even t - parity , and the t - quarks can not contribute to the process @xmath78 at tree - level . )",
    "the production of @xmath79 at the lhc can proceed through @xmath80 fusion or @xmath81 annihilation , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . in the littlest higgs model with t - parity",
    "the @xmath79 coupling is different from the sm prediction , as shown in eq.([htt ] ) .",
    "this will cause a correction to the production cross section @xmath82 here , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the top - quark yukawa couplings in the sm and the littlest higgs model with t - parity @xcite , respectively .",
    "4 shows some contours for the deviation from the sm cross section in the plane of @xmath73 versus the symmetry breaking scale @xmath44 . from this figure",
    "we see that the corrections decrease the sm cross section in the allowed parameter space .",
    "the corrections are more sizable for lower values of the scale @xmath44 . in a large part of the parameter space with @xmath85 gev",
    ", the corrections can be over @xmath46 in magnitude .",
    "like @xmath47 production , the production of @xmath86 or @xmath88 can proceed through @xmath80 fusion or @xmath81 annihilation at the lhc , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . in the littlest higgs model with t - parity",
    ", the t - quark can decay into @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , among which the decay @xmath4 is the most important channel @xcite .",
    "therefore , the final states of the production @xmath89 or @xmath90 are same as @xmath10 production . if we do not try to identify t - quark from top quark by mass reconstruction , the productions @xmath89 and @xmath90 will be counted into @xmath47 events .    in fig .",
    "6 we plot the ratio @xmath91 as a function of t - quark mass . in our calculations",
    "we used the cteq5 m patron distribution functions @xcite with @xmath92 and two - loop running coupling constant @xmath93 with @xmath94 . from fig .",
    "6 we see that the ratio can be over @xmath74 for @xmath95 below tev scale . when @xmath95 is 700 gev , the ratio can reach @xmath96 . with the increase of @xmath95 ,",
    "the production cross section becomes small because of the phase space suppression .",
    "note that due to the large mass difference between @xmath95 and @xmath97 , we may try to extract the signal of @xmath89 production from @xmath0 events by mass reconstructions .",
    "this is not easy since it requires the mass reconstruction for both @xmath31 and @xmath98 .",
    "given the analyses in both this section and the preceding section , we would like to remark on the overall impact of the modified cross sections for the higgs discovery at the lhc . as shown in @xcite",
    ", the @xmath10 production channel will be hard to be observed at the lhc . as shown in sec .",
    "iv , the contribution of the littlest higgs model with t - parity can decrease the sm @xmath10 cross section by @xmath46 , which thus makes the observation of this production channel even harder .",
    "but , at the same time , the new channels of @xmath99 and @xmath100 production may open up . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , for @xmath101 the production of @xmath99 and @xmath100 can have a cross section of @xmath102 with respect to the sm @xmath0 cross section . considering the heaviness of the @xmath6-quark , the production of @xmath103 may have less background than @xmath10 production , and thus this new channel may likely be observable at the lhc .",
    "we studied top quark pair production associated with a light higgs boson as a test of the littlest higgs model with t - parity at the ilc and lhc . for the production of @xmath104 at the ilc",
    ", we found that in a large part of the allowed parameter space the cross section can deviate from the sm prediction by over @xmath74 and thus may be observable .",
    "also , we found that the polarized beams lead to more sizable deviation and thus make the ilc more powerful in probing such effects .",
    "for the production of @xmath105 at the lhc , we found that in a large part of the parameter space the deviation from the sm cross section can be over @xmath46 .",
    "for the new production channel of @xmath89 or @xmath90 , we found that their cross section can be over 10% of the sm @xmath10 production for @xmath95 below tev scale .        n. arkani - hamed , a. g. cohen and h. georgi , 513 , 232 ( 2001 ) ; n. arkani - hamed , a. g. cohen , t. gregoire and j. g. wacker , 0208 , 020 ( 2002 ) ; n. arkani - hamed , a. g. cohen , e. katz , a. e. nelson , t. gregoire , j. g. wacker , 0208 , 021 ( 2002 ) ; i. low , w. skiba and d. smith , 66 , 072001 ( 2002 ) ; d. e. kaplan and m. schmaltz , 0310 , 039 ( 2003 ) . n. arkani - hamed , a. g. cohen , e. katz , a. e. nelson , 0207 , 034 ( 2002 ) ; s. chang , 0312 , 057 ( 2003 ) ; t. han , h. e. logan , b. mcelrath and l. t. wang , 67 , 095004 ( 2003 ) ; m. schmaltz , d. tucker - smith , ann .",
