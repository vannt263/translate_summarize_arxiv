    "cataclysmic variable stars ( cvs ) are a broad class of binaries that include a white dwarf primary star accreting via roche lobe overflow from a close companion , which usually resembles a cool main - sequence star ; @xcite gives a useful introduction .",
    "cvs are compact , low - luminosity systems with typical orbital periods @xmath1 of only a few hours .",
    "their evolution is driven largely by angular momentum loss , which over most of a cv s lifetime causes the orbit to gradually shrink . however , at a period near 75 min , the slope of the secondary s mass - radius relation reverses ( at least for hydrogen - burning secondaries ) which causes the orbital period to increase as angular momentum is lost .",
    "single white dwarfs evolve from red giants , which attain radii much larger than typical cv systems . unless a white dwarf is formed elsewhere and later captured  an unlikely event in the field ",
    "a cv must therefore have passed through common - envelope evolution at some point , during which the secondary was engulfed by the primary , leading to rapid loss of angular momentum . modeling the common - envelope stage with _",
    "a priori _ physics is extremely difficult , so the usual practice is to use simple parameterizations to describe the process , and match model outputs to the observed population ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "constraining the calculations requires an accurate accounting of the cv population .",
    "cvs are rather rare , low - luminosity systems , so this requires consideration of the channels through which they are discovered .",
    "the first cvs were discovered because they were variable stars , most conspicuously classical novae , driven by thermonuclear explosions of hydrogen - rich material accreted onto the white dwarf , and also dwarf novae , in which the accretion disk around the white dwarf transitions from time to time into a much brighter state .",
    "other cvs with less dramatic variability were found by color selection , especially ultraviolet excesses .",
    "the palomar - green survey found a sizable number of cvs @xcite , and more recently the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) obtained spectra of 285 color - selected cvs and cv candidates , most of which were new discoveries ( see @xcite and previous papers in that series ) .",
    "finally , many cvs emit x - rays ; x - ray surveys especially tend to find cvs in which the white - dwarf primary is strongly magnetized ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in recent years",
    "several synoptic sky surveys have generated a torrent of new cv discoveries .",
    "the catalina real time transient surveys ( crts ; @xcite ) have discovered over 1000 cvs on the basis of variability , most of them being discovered by the catalina telescope and denoted as `` css '' .",
    "the russian master project @xcite has also produced a large number of new discoveries , and most recently the asas - sn project @xcite , has come into its own .",
    "asas - sn uses 14-cm aperture lenses and reaches a limiting magnitude of only @xmath2 , but is now covering @xmath3 square degrees per night under favorable conditions ( k. stanek , private communication ) .",
    "many transient sources fade back to magnitudes beyond the reach of spectroscopic followup on 2-m class telescopes , but a substantial minority remain tractable .",
    "asas - sn s fast cadence and relatively shallow limiting magnitude make it an especially rich source of cvs amenable to further study .",
    "cvs also continue to be discovered through color selection . as examples",
    ", @xcite searched the sdss for am cvn stars ( ultra - short period cvs in which both components are degenerate dwarfs ) , and @xcite searched for hot white dwarfs and turned up twelve cvs as a byproduct .    to place the many newly - discovered cvs in context",
    ", it is necessary to follow them up , in particular to find orbital periods .",
    "periods can often be found from photometry , but in non - eclipsing systems radial - velocity spectroscopy gives more definitive results .",
    "spectroscopy also provides a wealth of ancillary information .",
    "we present here follow - up observations , mostly spectroscopic , of 35 newly - discovered cvs , 32 of which were found by crts , asas - sn , and/or master . for all , we determine orbital periods .",
    "thirty - two of the 35 periods are apparently are not published elsewhere , though superhump periods were available for three of of the objects . for three other objects",
    "we confirm periods that have appeared in the literature .",
    "the objects studied here were selected mostly on the basis of their observational tractability , and the lack of a published orbital period ( although in three cases we became aware of published periods before submitting this paper ) .",
    "we mostly avoided systems with known superhump periods , since their orbital periods can be deduced fairly well from this information ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "jrt maintains a master list of cvs and updates it regularly with new discoveries from the asas - sn , master , and css lists , and other discoveries as they come to his attention . before every observing run",
    ", this list is searched and targets that might yield useful spectra  in practice , targets that are @xmath4 mag or brighter at minimum  are culled out .",
    "final selection is made at the telescope using quick - look spectra and radial velocities measured in real time . in practice ,",
    "the selection process favored objects with strong h@xmath5 emission , and disfavored objects with strong continua and weak emission such as dwarf novae in outburst and some novalike variables .",
    "all our observations are from mdm observatory on kitt peak , arizona .",
    "_ spectroscopy .",
    "_ for nearly all the spectra , we used the ` modspec ' spectrograph with a 600 line mm@xmath6 grating .",
    "we mostly used a site 2048@xmath7 ccd detector , which yielded 2   pixel@xmath6 from 4210 to 7500  , with declining throughput toward the ends of the spectral range .",
    "when this detector was unavailable , we used a very similar 1024@xmath7 site detector ( ` templeton ' ) , which covered from 4660 to 6730  .",
    "the modspec was mounted mostly on the 2.4 m hiltner telescope , but for some of the brighter objects we used the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope .",
    "for a few of the 1.3-m spectra we used the mark iii grism spectrograph , which covered 4580 to 6850   at 2.3   pixel@xmath6 . on both telescopes , and with both spectrographs , we used an andor ikon camera to view the reflective slit jaws through a microscope , and guided the telescope with a separate off - axis guider . with this arrangement",
    "we could place any object that was bright enough for a usable spectrum in the slit , and track it accurately even if the portion of the light spilling onto the slit jaws was invisible .",
    "observations from a single site must be taken at intervals of about one sidereal day , which inevitably leads to some uncertainty in the number of cycles that elapsed when the object was out of view . to minimize this uncertainy",
    ", one must take observations far from the meridian .",
    "a spectrograph slit that is oriented north - south  the default for these instruments  will then have a position angle far from the parallactic angle , along which atmospheric dispersion acts @xcite .",
    "the resultant wavelength - dependent decentering causes light loss that varies with wavelength , and small spurious velocity shifts as well . to avoid this , at the 2.4 m we rotated the instrument to align the 1.1-arcsec slit with the parallactic angle when observing at large hour angles",
    "at the 1.3 m , the effect is less critical because of the larger projected slit width ( 2 arcsec ) and the rotation adjustment is much more awkward , so we did not rotate the instrument .",
    "we derived the wavelength calibration from hg , ne , and xe lamp spectra taken near the zenith in twilight .",
    "with modspec , we did not take lamps when the sun was more than 12 degrees below the horizon , and instead used the @xmath8 night sky line to track and correct for drift in the zero point of the calibration .",
    "other night - sky features that were not used in the calibration typically had mean velocities @xmath9 km s@xmath6 and an rms scatter of @xmath10 km s@xmath6",
    ". the night - sky technique did not give good results for the mark iii spectrograph , so with that instrument we took lamp spectra at each new telescope position , and at intervals of @xmath11 hr when following a target .",
    "_ radial velocities . _",
    "our emission - line radial velocities are almost entirely of h@xmath5 , since it almost always gives the best signal - to - noise ratio with our instrument .",
    "we use an algorithm developed by @xcite , in which the line profile is convolved with an antisymmetric function and the zero of the convolution  which occurs when the positive contribution from one side of the line balances the negative contribution from the other side  is taken as the line center . when measuring the doubled , steep - sided lines of edge - on dwarf novae , we adjusted the convolution function to be sensitive to the steep sides of the line . for narrower emission lines the function we used was the derivative of a gaussian , with the width tuned to the line . to calculate uncertainties in the velocities we propagated the estimated photon - statistics uncertainties of the spectrum",
    "points through the measurement process ; this will be optimistic , since it does not include any systematic effects ( e.g. , line - profile variations ) .",
    "when a late - type secondary star was present , we found its velocity using the xcsao task from the rvsao package @xcite , which implements the cross - correlation velocity algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "as a template , we used a composite of a large number of k - type spectral standards , shifted to zero velocity , this matched the @xmath12 k - type secondaries reasonably well .",
    "the algorithm estimates uncertainties using the asymmetry in the cross - correlation .    to search for radial - velocity periods",
    ", we constructed a grid of trial frequencies with spacing @xmath13 sufficiently dense for the time interval @xmath14 covered ( in practice , @xmath15 for long time - span searches , and denser for shorter spans ) .",
    "we then fit least - squares sinusoids of the form @xmath16 at each trial frequency @xmath17 , and computed @xmath18 ^ 2 \\over \\sigma_i^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the @xmath20-th observed data point .",
    "we display @xmath21 , which is visually analogous to a periodogram , and which tends to emphasize frequencies with very low @xmath22 ( and hence very good fits ) . to test the reliability of the choice of cycle count",
    ", we used the monte carlo tests described by @xcite , and in nearly all cases continued taking measurements until the likelihood of an incorrect choice was very small .",
    "all these techniques are incorporated in a quick - look reduction pipeline for use at the telescope . with this",
    "we monitor velocities in real time , update the period search , and plan observations for maximum period discrimination .",
    "_ photometry .",
    "_ for nearly all our time - series differential photometry , we used an andor ikon camera ( the same model used for slit viewing ) , attached to the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope at mdm .",
    "all observations were taken either unfiltered , or with a gg420 filter to suppress moonlight .",
    "the 2015 march observations of asas - sn 15aa , and the 2016 march observations of asas - sn 15cw , were taken through the slit - viewing microscope , with the target well away from the slit .",
    "these images were cosmetically poor but proved adequate for eclipse timing .",
    "the rest of the data were taken with the camera in direct imaging mode .",
    "exposures were typically 10 - 30 sec , with almost no dead time .",
    "we subtracted bias and dark frames from the raw images , and divided by a flat field image taken in twilight .    to measure instrumental magnitudes we used the iraf phot routine , with for the most part a 3-arcsec radius aperture . in each image we measured the program star , a brighter comparison star , and at least one check star .",
    "because of our non - standard passband we did not observe photometric standard stars .",
    "we instead used catalog data to find or estimate @xmath23 magnitudes for the comparison stars , and added these to the differential magnitudes to align them very roughly with @xmath23 .    _ secondary star contributions and distances .",
    "_ several objects show a late - type contribution due to a secondary star .",
    "when this was sufficiently distinct , we estimated its spectral type and contribution in the following manner . first , if the secondary s radial velocities were measurable , we shifted the individual spectra into the rest frame of the secondary and co - added them .",
    "we then scaled and subtracted spectra of stars from a range of spectral type , and adjusted the type and scale factor to best cancel the late - type features .",
    "the spectral type and estimated flux contribution correlate strongly , since metal features tend to grow stronger toward cooler types .    to estimate distances using the secondary contributions , we used a monte carlo technique described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we use the orbital period and a rough estimate of the secondary s mass to constrain its radius ( which depends only weakly on the mass ) , and then use its spectral type to estimate its surface brightness ; combining these with its flux contribution then yields a distance .",
    "note that we do not assume that the secondary follows a main - sequence mass - radius - temperature relation .",
    "the monte carlo technique picks all the input quantities from assumed distributions , and in particular accounts for the correlation between spectral type and secondary star contribution .",
    "table [ tab : star_info ] lists the objects , their coordinates , and the shorter names we use here , in order of right ascension .    figures  [ fig : cvplot1 ]  [ fig : cvplot9 ] show velocities , velocity periodograms , and folded velocities for 33 of the objects discussed here .",

    "the unusual variability suggests a magnetic system , but heii @xmath85 does not appear in our mean spectrum , so css1028@xmath7916 is likely to be some other kind of cv , possibly a z cam star ( a dwarf nova with bright ` standstills ' ) .",
    "this object was discovered by @xcite in a search for new white dwarfs in the sdss dr12 .",

    "the crts light curve , which probably includes both stars , is steady around magnitude 16.15 with a single possible brightening in 2006 to @xmath86 .",

    "tracing the hei @xmath90-wave by eye , and fitting it with a sinusoid , gave a semiamplitude @xmath91 km s@xmath6 and phase lagging by about 60 degrees from the fit given in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "emission line radial velocity amplitudes are notoriously difficult to interpret .",
    "the velocity amplitude @xmath92 km s@xmath6 listed in table [ tab : parameters ] is probably confounded by the @xmath90-wave contribution , and should not be taken to indicate the white dwarf s projected velocity amplitude @xmath93 .",

    "adopting this as an upper limit would imply @xmath95 we can use this to set an inclination - independent upper limit on the mass ratio @xmath96 , guided by integrations of particle trajectories in the roche potential , as follows .",
    "the @xmath90-wave comes from the impact of the mass - transfer stream on the disk .",
    "the disk radius is unknown , but it must be at least as large as the periastron distance of the mass - transfer stream , and it is likely to be significantly larger . as a rough upper limit to the @xmath90-wave s in - plane velocity , we take the keplerian speed at the periastron the gas stream would reach if it were not to collide with the disk . the hot spot s velocity is likely to be greater than the local keplerian speed , because it includes gas from the fast - moving stream , but the hot spot is likely to be at a significantly larger radius than the periastron , so this should be a reasonable upper limit . using a nominal @xmath97 m@xmath98 , we find @xmath99 for @xmath100 , so that @xmath101 .",
    "this is not unexpected ",
    "@xcite gives @xmath102 for stars near this orbital period .    since this is an upper limit , it is possible that the mass ratio is much lower , which would be significant .",
    "late in their evolution , cvs with hydrogen - rich secondaries evolve toward a minimum period near 75 min as their secondaries lose mass ; in theory , further mass transfer should increase the secondary s radius , and increase the orbital period .",
    "cvs that have evolved past the period minimum are known as ` post - bounce ' systems .",
    "they should have periods somewhat longer than the minimum and anomalously low mass ratios ( @xcite give a recent tabulation of post - bounce candidates ) . at 91 minutes , with an evidently low mass - transfer rate and a possible low mass ratio , this system may be post - bounce .",
    "this first entry in the asas - sn list for 2015 was detected on 2015 jan .  1 around 13.8 mag , and was matched to a @xmath103 quiescent source .",
    "the crts light curve , which extends from late 2005 to mid-2013 , has 289 detections over eight seasons , and detects three previous outbursts , one of which reached 13.8 mag on 2006 july 22 .",
    "the mean spectrum from 2015 march ( fig .  [ fig : cvplot5 ] ) shows a strong contribution from a late - type star .",
    "we classify this as k4.5 ( @xmath104 subclass ) and estimate that it contributes about half the light in the @xmath23 band .",
    "the fluxed spectra imply @xmath105 for the secondary contribution alone , where the uncertainty reflects only the range of acceptable spectral decompositions .",
    "this estimate is probably on the faint side because of occasional cloud and losses at the spectrograph slit , so we adopt @xmath106 for the secondary .",
    "the radial velocities of the late - type star are modulated with a period near 0.3755 d , or 9.01 hr , and a sizable semiamplitude @xmath107 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the emission - line velocities show greater scatter , but corroborate this period .",
    "the spectral type of the donor star is normal for this period ; it is cooler than predicted by a main - sequence mass - radius relation , but similar to the secondaries of other cvs in this period range @xcite .",
    "the css magnitudes ( excluding outbursts ) show a variation with two maxima per orbit , and unequal minima , which are clearly ellipsoidal .",
    "we used these data to refine the ephemeris as follows .",
    "first , we fixed the epoch to barycentric jd ( bjd ) 2457109.974(4 ) , which is the blue - to - red crossing of the absorption line velocities .",
    "this corresponds to inferior conjunction of the secondary ( i.e. , the phase at which an eclipse of the white dwarf would occur for an edge - on system ) , and its uncertainty amounts to @xmath108 cycle .",
    "then , we folded the css magnitudes until the deeper minimum was both reasonably sharp and coincided with the chosen epoch ; fig .",
    "[ fig : crtsphot ] shows the result . because the css data extend nearly 10 years earlier than the chosen epoch , the period is greatly refined to 0.375540(2 ) d. we obtained most of our spectra in 2015 march , using the 1.3 m telescope remotely . the absorption - line orbit and",

    "another eclipse light curve was obtained three days later , and on april 10 we obtained a third light curve , again remotely , using the andor camera in direct mode , again without a filter .",
    "two further eclipse light curves were obtained in 2016 january .",
    "[ fig:15aaeclipse ] shows the light curves .",
    "the eclipse is very shallow , @xmath109 mag on the ingress side , and is asymmetric , recovering only by 0.1 to 0.2 mag . in egress .",
    "the center of the eclipse occurs around phase 0.007 in the absorption line ephemeris , which is consistent with zero .",
    "because the phase of eclipse center corresponds accurately with the inferior conjunction of the red star , it seems likely that the white dwarf and the brightest regions at the disk center are being eclipsed .",
    "the asymmetry may be due to the occultation of the ` hot spot ' where the mass transfer stream strikes the outer edge of the accretion disk . for our final ephemeris , we adjusted the epoch slightly to correspond to the midpoint between the steepest portions of the ingress and the egress in the april 10 light curve , yielding for barycentric julian date of the inferior conjunction of secondary @xmath110 this was used to compute the phases in figs .

    "the emission and absorption velocity curves are perfectly antiphased , to within the uncertainty .",
    "this is a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for the emission lines to trace the motion of the white dwarf .",
    "the h@xmath5 line profile appears steady around the orbit , with two roughly equal peaks separated by @xmath111 km s@xmath6 , shifting smoothly with the @xmath112-velocity , as would be expected from a symmetrical accretion disk .",
    "while the emission line velocities are not nearly accurate enough to define a precise mass ratio , their best - fit amplitude is a little less than the absorption amplitude , suggesting a mass ratio not too far below unity .",

    "the large - amplitude ellipsoidal modulation , and the lack of eclipses , constrain the plausible range for @xmath20 to be between about 70 and 79 degrees .    in this range of inclination ,",
    "the observed @xmath147 km s@xmath6 is consistent with white dwarf masses near 0.6  0.7 m@xmath98 and @xmath148 .",
    "the mass ratio exceeds unity for white dwarf masses greater than 1 m@xmath98 .",
    "the secondary - based distance estimation ( see section 2 ) gives @xmath149 pc .",
    "the galactic latitude is 30.7 degrees , so the star is likely to be at least 1 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "a spectrum of this object was published by @xcite , who found h@xmath5 in emission and noted indications of a late - type secondary contribution .",
    "@xcite discovered photometric modulations in outburst at periods of 0.05436 and 0.05827 d , which they found puzzling but tentatively interpreted as a negative superhump and an orbital period respectively .",
    "we obtained time series spectroscopy in 2014 june . the mean spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cvplot7 ] ) shows a strong contribution from a star with spectral type k4 @xmath104 subtype .",
    "decompositions indicate that the k star contributes about 80 per cent of the @xmath23-band light ; fractions between 55 and 90 per cent gave acceptable results .",
    "the absorption - line velocities derived from cross - correlation ( and excluding the nad line , which can be confused with hei @xmath89 emission ) shows a modulation at @xmath150 d , or 8.48 hr , with semi - amplitude @xmath151 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the h@xmath5 emission line velocities have lower signal - to - noise but have a modulation consistent with this period .",
    "the 8.48-hr period therefore represents the orbital period of the cv , and is not from some line - of - sight interloper .",
    "if we ( 1 ) assume the absorption velocity amplitude @xmath152 accurately reflects the secondary center - of - mass motion ( 2 ) assume that the white dwarf mass is above 0.6 solar masses , and ( 3 ) require the mass ratio @xmath153 , then the orbital inclination is less than about 60 degrees .",
    "the phase of the emission velocities is offset from the absorption by @xmath154 , while the white - dwarf velocity should be offset by a half - cycle ; consequently , we think it unwise to interpret the emission line velocities as the white - dwarf motions .",
    "the @xcite models that best match the secondary s spectral type at this orbital period have @xmath155 m@xmath98 .",
    "we again estimated a distance using the secondary spectrum ( section 2 ) . because the absolute flux measurement through the spectrograph slit is uncertain , we referred to a single @xmath23-band acquisition image from the mdm osmos instrument ( see @xcite ) , which was taken in partly cloudy conditions , and calibrated it using @xmath23 magnitudes of ten stars in the field taken from apass @xcite , yielding @xmath156 ( estimated uncertainty ) . for a nominal @xmath157 m@xmath98 ( used only to estimate the roche lobe size ) ,",
    "the distance came to @xmath158 pc .",
    "while the secondary spectral type is normal for this @xmath1 , the superhump - like modulations reported in outburst by @xcite are unexpected , and their interpretation is not clear .",
    "the difference between the frequencies of the two modulations bears no obvious relationship to the orbital frequency .",
    "this transient was discovered by asas - sn on 2013 april 05 , with @xmath159 , and was designated asas - sn 13ab @xcite . a spectrum taken soon after discovery was consistent with a dwarf nova outburst .",

    "the mean spectrum shows a strong secondary - star contribution with a spectral type of k5.5 @xmath115 2 subtypes .",
    "nascent molecular bands in the continuum indicate a slightly later type than the absorption lines , which match best around k5 .",
    "the secondary contributes about half the light in the @xmath23 band , typically giving around @xmath165 for the secondary contribution .",
    "the radial velocity of the k star is modulated with a period of 7.16(2 ) hr and a semiamplitude @xmath166 km s@xmath6 ; the orbit is unambiguous with only 17 velocities taken over 6 nights .",
    "the best period in the h@xmath5 emission - line velocity matches the absorption period within the mutual error ; we adopted the weighted average , 7.17(2 ) hr .",
    "the phase at which the emission lines increase through their mean velocity is @xmath167 in the absorption - line ephemeris , which is consistent with the phase expected if the emission lines trace the white dwarf motion . if we take this at face value , the nominal mass ratio is @xmath168 , which is smaller than one might expect .",
    "we have only 17 velocities , and the reliability of emission line velocities for dynamics is questionable , but this does suggest a somewhat more massive white dwarf than usual , or an undermassive secondary . because of this , for the monte carlo distance estimate we assumed a secondary mass distribution centering on 0.5 m@xmath98 , slightly lower than suggested by the @xcite calculations .",
    "the secondary mass enters only weakly into the calculation , which gave @xmath169 pc .",
