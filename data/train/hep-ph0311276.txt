    "in recent years , data on jet observables from lep , hera and the tevatron have reached an impressive level of experimental precision . using these data for a determination of the strong coupling constant , or as a measurement of parton distributions in the colliding hadrons , it turns out that the error on these extractions is largely dominated by the uncertainty on the underlying theoretical calculations , which are accurate only to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in perturbative qcd .    in order to improve on this situation ,",
    "theoretical calculations of jet observables accurate to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) are mandatory . for each observable ,",
    "they require several ingredients : to compute the corrections to an @xmath5-jet observable , one needs the two - loop @xmath5-parton matrix elements , the one - loop ( @xmath5 + 1)-parton matrix elements and the tree level ( @xmath5 + 2)-parton matrix elements . in the recent past",
    ", enormous progress has been made especially on the calculation of two - loop @xmath6 and @xmath7 qcd matrix elements , which are now known for all massless parton ",
    "parton scattering processes  @xcite relevant to hadron colliders as well as for @xmath8  @xcite and its crossings  @xcite .",
    "most of these results were even verified independently by different groups . for the corresponding partonic processes ,",
    "the one - loop matrix elements with one additional parton and the tree - level matrix elements with two more partons are also known and form part of nlo programs for @xmath0  @xcite and @xmath9 reactions  @xcite . since these matrix elements lead to infrared singularities due to one or two partons becoming theoretically unresolved ( soft or collinear ) , one needs to find one- and two - particle subtraction terms , which account for these singularities in the matrix elements , and are sufficiently simple to be integrated analytically over the unresolved phase space .",
    "one - particle subtraction at tree level is well understood from nlo calculations@xcite and general algorithms are available for one - particle subtraction at one loop@xcite , in a form that could recently be integrated analytically  @xcite .",
    "tree - level two - particle subtraction terms have been extensively studied in the literature@xcite , their integration over the unresolved phase space could however up to now be performed only in one particular infrared subtraction scheme ( the hybrid subtraction method ) in the calculation of higher order corrections to the photon - plus - one - jet rate in @xmath1 annihilation  @xcite . the same techniques ( and the same scheme ) were used very recently in the rederivation of the time - like gluon - to - gluon splitting function from splitting amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "a general two - particle subtraction procedure , consisting of subtraction terms which can be safely implemented numerically and at the same time are sufficiently simple to be integrated analytically is still lacking at the moment .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to contribute to such a method by classifying and computing all four - particle phase space integrals relevant to @xmath0 parton reactions in massless qcd .",
    "one of the most widely used infrared subtraction schemes at nlo is the dipole formalism established by catani and seymour  @xcite .",
    "the formalism relies on an exact factorisation of the @xmath5-particle phase space into an ( @xmath51)-particle phase space and a so - called dipole phase space , which is , up to a normalisation factor , equal to a massless three - particle phase space . in this formalism ,",
    "one derives ( process - independent ) dipole subtraction terms for all single unresolved partonic configurations , which are then integrated over the dipole phase space ( corresponding to a three - parton configuration of emitter , unresolved parton and spectator ) .",
    "if combined appropriately , these integrals of the subtraction terms over the dipole phase space can be related to integrals of @xmath7 tree level qcd matrix elements integrated over the three - particle phase space .    at nnlo ,",
    "one encounters configurations of two unresolved partons between emitter and spectator . as will be shown below in section  [ sec : tripole ] , these can be accommodated into a tripole formulation , relying on the exact factorisation of the @xmath5-particle phase space into an ( @xmath52)-particle phase space and a tripole phase space .",
    "this tripole phase space is proportional to the four - particle phase space .",
    "based on this observation , one might envisage that all double unresolved partonic configurations which correspond to a single emitter - spectator pair may be expressed by appropriate tripole subtraction terms .",
    "to facilitate their analytic integration over the tripole phase space , these may be further combined to relate to integrals of @xmath0 tree - level qcd matrix elements integrated over the four - particle phase space . in this paper , we show that all integrals of this type can be expressed as linear combinations of only four so - called master integrals , which we compute both analytically and numerically .",
    "the reduction to master integrals follows largely methods developed for multi - loop integrals , and is briefly presented in section  [ sec : red ] . to compute the resulting master integrals analytically in section  [ sec : an ] , we develop first the tripole formulation of the four - particle phase space , which is then used to calculate two of the master integrals .",
    "we then show that the remaining two master integrals can be inferred from unitarity relations between known multi - loop integrals and phase space integrals .",
    "further , one of the master integrals calculated explicitly , as well as a reducible integral , are rederived from unitarity relations as crosschecks .    in section  [ sec : num ] , the master integrals are calculated numerically .",
    "the infrared poles are isolated by an automated sector decomposition algorithm which already has proven useful in the calculation of multi - loop integrals  @xcite , and which has been extended in  @xcite and in the present work to tackle infrared divergent integrals over a multi - parton phase space as well .",

    "the integral of the term ( [ eq : singleterm ] ) over the four - particle phase space is denoted by @xmath36 the phase space measure @xmath37 is defined in ( [ eq : r4 ] ) in the appendix .",
    "the topology of @xmath38 ( interconnection of propagators and external momenta ) is uniquely determined by the set of propagators @xmath39 . in order to visualise the topology of @xmath38 in the form of a cut diagram",

    "any integral @xmath38 for a given topology ( fixed set of @xmath34 propagators ) can be attributed to a class of integrals @xmath42 of identical numerator mass dimension @xmath43 and denominator mass dimension @xmath44 .",
    "it should be noted that we also allow the cut - propagators to appear in general with integer powers larger than unity , without further specifying the physical meaning of those . from combinatorics",

    "[ sec : red ]    the number @xmath46 of the integrals grows quickly as @xmath47 increase , but the integrals are not all linearly independent .",
    "these linear relations are the so - called integration - by - part ( ibp ) identities , which were originally formulated for multi - loop two - point functions  @xcite with ordinary loop propagators , but can be safely extended to multi - loop integrals with cut propagators  @xcite .",
    "these identities follow from the fact that the integral over the total derivative with respect to any loop momentum vanishes in dimensional regularisation @xmath48 where @xmath49 is any combination of propagators , scalar products and loop momentum vectors .",
    "@xmath49 can be a vector or tensor of any rank .",
    "the ibp identities for three - loop two - point functions were derived and solved symbolically a long time ago  @xcite in the context of the calculation of the three - loop @xmath50-function .",
    "the solution of these identities was implemented into the program package mincer  @xcite written in the algebraic programming language form  @xcite .",
    "mincer was widely used in recent years to compute a large number of multi - loop corrections which correspond to three - loop two - point functions or can be related to them by expansion .",
    "reviews of these results can be found in  @xcite .    in recent times , ibp - type relations between multi - loop integrals with more than two legs have been studied extensively . in particular , it was found that scalar multi - loop integrals with three or more legs fulfil , besides the ordinary ibp relations , also relations following from the invariance of the integrals under an infinitesimal lorentz transformation .",
    "these lorentz invariance ( li ) identities , combined with the ibp identities , were used extensively in the computation of two - loop four - point matrix elements  @xcite . in a related development , it was observed that the ibp identities for feynman integrals with the same total number of external and loop momenta are equivalent  @xcite , a development that was used soon thereafter to compute two - loop three - point functions  @xcite .    exploiting the observation that differentiations involved in the integration - by - parts identities are insensitive to the imaginary parts of the two terms in a cut - propagator  @xcite , one can generalise the ibp method to phase space integrals over tree - level or loop matrix elements . in the solution of the ibp equations for",
    "a given cut integral , one obtains integrals with one or more of the cut propagators eliminated .",
    "these integrals can be discarded , since they do not contribute anymore to the same cut of the underlying multi - loop diagram .    to derive the reduction of any given integral @xmath38 of the form ( [ eq : itmaster ] )",
    ", we use the same strategy  @xcite as applied in the reduction of the two - loop four - point functions in  @xcite by generating all ibp identities for integrals up to the maximum values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 required for the integration of qcd four - particle matrix elements . from dimensional counting , one finds @xmath53 , @xmath54 . the solution algorithm  @xcite proceeds by solving all identities up to these values using the computer algebra languages form  @xcite and maple  @xcite .    after carrying out the reduction for all topologies that can be formed from the invariants and triple invariants involving the four final state momenta , we find that all inclusive four - particle phase space integrals of massless qcd matrix elements can be expressed as a linear combination of four master integrals .",
    "these four master integrals are : @xmath55 the reduction procedure generates coefficients containing explicit poles of up to @xmath56 in front of @xmath57 and up to @xmath58 in front of @xmath59 , while the coefficients multiplying @xmath60 and @xmath61 are finite .    in the following two sections , we will compute these four master integrals both analytically and numerically to a sufficiently high order in @xmath62 required for the calculation of integrated four - particle qcd matrix elements .",

    ". the main features of this formalism are factorisation formulae for matrix elements and phase space which locally reproduce single soft and single collinear behaviour of the cross sections in the appropriate limits .",
    "the corresponding dipole contributions to the cross sections can be integrated analytically and numerically over the whole phase space .",
    "in particular , the exact factorisation of the three - parton phase space into a dipole phase space and a two - parton phase space is obtained by redefining a set of three massless on - shell momenta ( emitter , unresolved parton , spectator ) into two on - shell massless momenta .",

    "if yes , the integration region is split according to @xmath195 and the resulting integrals are remapped to integrals from zero to one . otherwise , simply the transformations @xmath196 are performed for the @xmath194 .",
    "note that the limits @xmath197 do in most cases _ not _ lead to a real @xmath198 singularity upon integration , even if they make the denominator vanish , but they will be remapped nevertheless for the sake of numerical stability .",
    "these transformations as well as the sector decomposition are iterated if necessary , that is , if a ( composite , as for example @xmath199 present in @xmath61 , and not only a trivial factor .",
    "note that after the transformation ( [ t6 ] ) a previously trivial factor like @xmath188 becomes composite . ] ) denominator of the integrand still can vanish at a certain phase space point .",
    "the iterated sector decomposition proceeds as follows : the program determines the minimal set @xmath200 of parameters which in the limit @xmath201 make a composite denominator of the matrix element vanish .",
    "( the parameters @xmath202 have been renamed @xmath203 ) .",
    "then the corresponding integrals are decomposed into @xmath51 subsectors according to @xmath204 in each new subsector ,",
    "the variables are remapped to the unit cube by the substitution @xmath205 by construction , @xmath206 factorises from at least one of the denominator functions .",
    "the sector decomposition procedure is iterated until the denominators are of the form @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is a non - negative function of the parameters @xmath209 .",
    "then subtractions of the singularities , which are now all factorised explicitly , are carried out , using identities like @xmath210 where @xmath211 is finite by construction .",
    "after having carried out the subtractions for each @xmath212 , the expansion in @xmath62 can be performed .",
    "the result is a laurent series in @xmath62 where the pole coefficients are finite functions of the parameters @xmath209 which can be integrated numerically .",
    "note that the coefficient functions of a certain pole , produced by the iterated decomposition of a certain primary sector into subsectors , are all summed over _ before _ numerical integration in order to avoid large numerical errors due to large cancellations .",
    "in contrast , the contributions from the _ primary _ sectors ( i.e. six contributions in the @xmath0 case ) are summed over only _",
    "after _ the numerical integration . in this way",
    ", one has a strong check at hand if for topological reasons ( symmetry of the considered integral ) some primary sectors have to yield identical results , while the numerical error is not substantially increased .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the functions occurring in the phase space integrals are quite different from the functions present in any virtual multi - loop integral after feynman parametrisation : they are not polynomial anymore , as they unavoidably contain square - roots ( and fake singularities away from the origin , as discussed above ) .",
    "this is of course not a principal problem for the algorithm , but has to be dealt with appropriately .",
    "the @xmath213-function and the @xmath214 term in ( [ t6tilde ] ) become quite involved expressions after several iterations , but do not present any problem for the numerical integration .",
    "the program consists of 3 building blocks : the first one serves to perform the iterated sector decomposition until a form of the integrand is reached where all singularities are factored out explicitly as described above .",
    "the corresponding algorithm has been implemented in mathematica  @xcite .",
    "then the subtractions and the expansion in @xmath62 are carried out to obtain a set of finite functions for each pole coefficient .",
    "these functions are then translated into fortran functions . up to this stage ,",
    "the method is _ not _ `` numerical '' yet . only the complicated structure and",
    "the large number of these functions hampers their analytical integration .",
    "the third part consists in the numerical integration of these functions , where the monte carlo program bases  @xcite is used .",
    "all fortran files are generated automatically using maple  @xcite and perl .",
    "perl routines also serve to automate compilation , job submission and summation of the results from the different primary sectors , such that the only `` manual '' input is the matrix element and the desired expansion level in @xmath62 .",
    "the program produces an overall number of 13 subsectors for the integral @xmath59 , 690 subsectors for @xmath60 and 321 subsectors for @xmath61 .",
    "the integration time ranges from about 10 minutes for @xmath59 to about 24 hours for @xmath60 if a numerical accuracy better than 1% is demanded .",
    "the following numerical results are obtained for the master integrals : @xmath215\\;,\\\\ r_6&=&s_{\\gamma}(q^2)^{-2\\e}\\left[0.64498 + 7.0423\\e+40.507\\e^2 + { \\cal o}(\\e^3)\\right]\\;,\\\\ r_{8,a}&=&s_{\\gamma}(q^2)^{-2 - 2\\e}\\left[\\frac{5.0003}{\\e^4}- \\frac{0.0013}{\\e^3}-\\frac{65.832}{\\e^2}- \\frac{151.53}{\\e}+ 37.552+{\\cal o}(\\e)\\right]\\;,\\\\ r_{8,b}&=&s_{\\gamma}(q^2)^{-2 - 2\\e}\\left[\\frac{0.74986}{\\e^4}-\\frac{0.00009}{\\e^3}- \\frac{14.001}{\\e^2}-\\frac{52.911}{\\e}-99.031 + { \\cal o}(\\e)\\right]\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the reducible integral @xmath159 also has been calculated numerically to complete the cross - checks : @xmath216\\;.\\ ] ] the agreement of the numerical and analytical results is better than 1% .",
    "[ sec : conc ]    in this paper , we studied the inclusive four - particle phase space integrals of ( @xmath0)-parton qcd matrix elements . these integrals contain infrared divergences due to the soft or collinear emission of up to two partons , which occur also in nnlo calculations of jet observables .",
    "we demonstrated that these phase space integrals can be expressed as a linear combination of only four master integrals .",
    "these four master integrals were computed both analytically and numerically up to their fourth order terms in dimensional regularisation , as required for nnlo calculations .",
    "the analytic results for them are :    @xmath217\\ ; , \\setcounter{equation}{\\value{myr6 } } \\\\ r_{8,a } & = &   s_\\gamma \\ ; ( q^2)^{-2 - 2\\e}\\ , \\bigg[\\frac{5}{\\e^4}-\\frac{20\\pi^2}{3\\e^2 } -\\frac{126\\zeta_3}{\\e}+\\frac{7\\pi^4}{18 } + { \\cal o}(\\e ) \\bigg ] \\ ; , \\setcounter{equation}{\\value{myr8a } } \\\\ r_{8,b } & = &   s_\\gamma \\ ; ( q^2)^{-2 - 2\\e}\\ , \\bigg [ \\frac{3}{4\\e^4}-\\frac{17\\pi^2}{12\\e^2 } -\\frac{44\\zeta_3}{\\e}-\\frac{61\\pi^4}{60}+ { \\cal o}(\\e)\\bigg ] \\;.\\setcounter{equation}{\\value{myr8b}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the inclusive four - particle phase space integrals of qcd @xmath0 matrix elements may in future work be used for the construction of infrared subtraction terms for the real contributions to nnlo jet calculations . in the case of two - jet production in @xmath1 collisions , the @xmath0 matrix elements can serve immediately as subtraction terms , since the only requirements on subtraction terms are that they coincide with the full matrix element in all infrared singular limits ( which is clearly the case ) and that they can be integrated analytically over the inclusive phase space ( which we have demonstrated here ) . constructing nnlo subtraction terms for the double real emission contributions to three - jet production in @xmath1 collisions from @xmath0 matrix elements , which can serve to locally approximate the full @xmath218 matrix element in certain limits ,",
    "is a yet outstanding task .",
    "to the same aim , one could also look for a way to relate already existing nnlo subtraction terms  @xcite to @xmath0 qcd matrix elements . in this context , it should be pointed out that the frequently used nlo dipole subtraction terms  @xcite for multi - jet production in @xmath1 annihilation can in fact be recombined to yield @xmath7 qcd matrix elements .    in the course of the calculations presented in this paper , new analytical and numerical methods for handling infrared divergent phase space integrals were developed .",
    "in particular , the tripole parametrisation of the four - particle phase space incorporates explicitly the phase space factorisation from an ( @xmath5 + 2)-parton phase space to an @xmath5-parton phase space and a factor which accounts for the singular emission , as required for @xmath5-jet production at nnlo .",
    "this tripole formulation has the advantage that it avoids the introduction of non - linear transformations of momenta , which is crucial for the analytic integration . for the construction of an nnlo monte carlo parton - level event generator ,",
    "a smooth mapping of all potentially singular regions of phase space is essential for numerical stability .",
    "such a mapping can for example be achieved using non - linear momentum transformations  @xcite .",
    "however , the phase space parametrisations used to integrate the subtraction terms analytically and those used in the monte carlo program do not need to be the same .    formulating the unitarity relations between phase space and loop integrals in a form which connects different master integrals enabled us to deduce three of the four master integrals from known multi - loop integrals , such that only one of them had to be calculated explicitly .",
    "thus we were able to use multi - loop techniques in order to obtain results for complicated phase space integrals .",
    "the iterated sector decomposition , a method originally developed for infrared divergent loop integrals , where the poles are isolated automatically and their coefficients are calculated numerically , was extended here to phase space integrals .",
    "this technique is particularly powerful for ( @xmath219)-particle reactions , where the phase space integrals depend only on one overall scale . as a consequence ,",
    "the pole coefficients are just numbers which can be calculated numerically once and for all .",
    "this method can also be useful in cases where an analytic calculation of the phase space integrals can not be achieved anymore , not only for inclusive cross sections , but also in view of the construction of an nnlo monte carlo program , where experimental cuts acting on the phase space boundaries can complicate the analytic integrations .",
    "the excellent agreement between analytical and numerical results for the four master integrals evaluated here provides a strong check on both calculational approaches .",
