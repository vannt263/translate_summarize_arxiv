    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a necessary condition for a generic smooth map @xmath16 to be a @xmath13-prem is the existence of a @xmath17-equivariant map from the double point set @xmath18 ( endowed with the restriction of the factor exchanging involution on @xmath19 ) to the sphere @xmath20 ( endowed with the antipodal involution @xmath21 ) .",

    "one can show that when @xmath25 and @xmath26 , this necessary condition is also sufficient @xcite .    using this result ,",
    "it is not hard to see that every generic smooth map @xmath4 between orientable smooth @xmath27-manifolds is an @xmath27-prem for all even @xmath28 ; indeed , an equivariant map @xmath29 exists for all even @xmath27 ( including @xmath30 ) as observed in the proof of theorem [ 1.2 ] below .",
    "[ 1.1 ] is every generic smooth map between orientable surfaces a @xmath31-prem ?",
    "it is known that the answer is affirmative in the following cases : for maps of any @xmath31-manifold into @xmath32 @xcite ; for maps of @xmath33 into any orientable @xmath31-manifold ( yamamoto  akhmetiev @xcite ) ; and for maps @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "petersen proved that the answer is also affirmative for all regular coverings of degree @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this is established as follows : a group of order @xmath35 is solvable ; a solvable covering is a composition of abelian coverings ; an abelian covering over a compact polyhedron with free abelian @xmath36 is induced from a covering over a torus @xmath37 ; a covering over a torus is equivalent by a change of coordinates to a product of coverings over @xmath38 ; a product of coverings over @xmath38 is a composition of coverings over the torus induced from coverings over @xmath38 ; and a covering over @xmath38 is obviously a @xmath31-prem .",
    "petersen also proved that if a composition of two coverings is a @xmath31-prem , then each of them is a @xmath31-prem @xcite .",
    "let us note that the regular covering corresponding to the kernel of the monodromy homomorphism of a covering @xmath39 factors through @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , every covering with solvable monodromy group ( hence in particular every covering of degree @xmath40 ) between orientable surfaces is a @xmath31-prem .",
    "let us also note that a covering over a connected sum of tori is a 2-prem if it is induced from a covering of the wedge of these tori ; indeed , _ any _ covering induced from a covering over a wedge of tori is a 2-prem ( see theorem [ 2.7 ] below and the subsequent remarks ) .",
    "finally , we should note that one motivation of problem [ 1.1 ] is that its affirmative solution would yield an affirmative answer to the following    [ 1.4 ] @xcite , @xcite does every inverse limit of orientable @xmath31-manifolds embed in @xmath41 ?",
    "p. m. akhmetiev proved that an inverse limit of stably parallelizable @xmath27-manifolds embeds in @xmath42 for @xmath43 @xcite ( see @xcite for an explicit proof ) .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath39-adic solenoid , which is an inverse limit of copies of @xmath38 , does not embed in the plane .",

    "@xmath47 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear from theorem [ 1.2 ] below that problem [ 1.1 ] is a typical problem of four - dimensional topology , etc . ] in that there is no lack of potential counterexamples ( such as 5-fold coverings and regular 60-fold coverings , not to mention generic approximations of various branched coverings ) but an obviuous lack of invariants / obstructions capable of detecting actual counterexamples .",
