    "the decline in average star - formation rate provides a fundamental constraint to hierarchical models of galaxy formation , over half the age of the universe . using the taurus tunable filter ( ttf ) on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) we have obtained an emission - line sample of faint star - forming galaxies over half the age of the universe . this",
    "_ ttf field galaxy survey _",
    "( @xcite  1999 ) is primarily sensitive to star - forming galaxies seen through  at three discrete wavelength intervals , corresponding to redshifts @xmath1 , 0.24 and 0.39 . in selecting through emission - lines",
    ", we are using a quantity that scales directly with star - formation rate , effectively selecting galaxies by precisely the parameter we aim to measure . by scanning with wavelength",
    ", we automatically define a strict volume - limited sample , less affected by the magnitude - volume sampling effects of conventional broadband surveys .",
    "thus , the tunable filter technique provides a unique means of quantifying the star - formation activity across redshifts relevant to interpretation of the most recent star - formation history of the universe .",
    "the red taurus tunable filter is a tunable fabry - perot interferometer covering 6500@xmath89600    ( @xcite  1998a , b ) .",
    "the spacing between the ttf plates is much narrower and adjustable over a wider range than conventional etalons , thereby giving its function as a tunable narrow passband . in effect",
    ", the ttf affords monochromatic imaging with an adjustable passband of between 6 and 60   .",
    "ttf has an important advantage in the detection of faint line emission over conventional redshift surveys .",
    "deep pencil - beam surveys typically pre - select objects down to @xmath9 ( @xcite  1995 ) or @xmath10 ( @xcite  1995 ) , since these represent the practical spectroscopic limits on the 4  meter telescopes used .",
    "however , these limits are set assuming the objects are dominated by continuum . objects with continuum flux beyond the spectroscopic limit but with emission - lines above the limit could be detected by these same instruments , albeit through the lines alone . however , because the initial selection is made from the broadband flux , such objects are excluded _ at the outset _ on the basis of having too faint a continuum level .    in order to match ttf , a broadband - selected redshift survey needs to select objects to a fainter limit , in the knowledge that for the faintest objects , only those with emission - lines will register a detection spectroscopically .",
    "however , this represents a vastly inefficient way of finding emission - line galaxies . between @xmath9 and @xmath11 , the number of objects on the sky ( per magnitude interval ) increases by an order of magnitude ( @xcite  1995 ) .",
    "such object densities would be impractical to search given the limitations of current multi - slit spectrographs in terms of object multiplex . in this paper",
    "we compare the very different emission - line galaxy samples obtained by the _ ttf field galaxy survey _ and the autofib galaxy redshift survey ( @xcite  1996 ) in regions where the two overlap .    in this paper",
    "we describe the _ ttf field galaxy survey_. section [ s : strategy ] discusses the adopted survey strategy and the reasons for this approach .",
    "section [ s : selection ] describes the selection of the main emission - line sample and its attributes .",
    "known selection effects and potential sources of contamination are reviewed and their effect on the sample discussed .",
    "the main characteristics of the sample measurable from these ttf data are given in sect .",
    "[ s : character ] . included in this section",
    "are narrowband number - counts and a comparison of our narrowband selected emission - line galaxies with those of the broadband - selected autofib galaxy redshift survey .",
    "we also derive preliminary  luminosity functions and compare them to those of existing surveys .",
    "concluding remarks are made in sect .",
    "[ s : conclremarks ] . unless stated otherwise , we assume a friedmann model cosmology ( cosmological constant @xmath12 ) with a hubble constant @xmath13  and deceleration parameter @xmath14 .",
    "considerable freedom exists in a scanning narrowband survey conducted with a tunable filter , by virtue of the flexibility of the instrument .",
    "the elements that remain fixed are field coverage on the sky and the airy - profile shape of the passband .",
    "the adjustable parameters are the passband width , the passband coverage and sampling rate with wavelength , and the exposure time per slice . individually , each affects the number of objects obtained and a judicious selection is necessary if sample size is to be maximized .",
    "the _ ttf field galaxy survey _ is a survey for redshifted emission - line galaxies in the field .",
    "all fields were taken with ttf in 2  at the @xmath15 cassegrain focus of the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "the survey comprises 15 scans of 10 slices , at random high - galactic latitude fields scattered around the sky . by _ slice _ ,",
    "we mean an exposure at a particular wavelength , or the image obtained by co - adding many such exposures .",
    "the total sky coverage is 0.27  with most fields selected on the celestial equator for maximum accessibility from both northern and southern observatories .",
    "the scans are distributed between the 707/26 ( @xmath16 ) , 814/33 ( @xmath17 ) and 909/40 ( @xmath18 ) ttf blocking filters .",
    "each scan was repeated 3 times with the telescope offset by @xmath19  between each so that cosmic - rays and ghost images could be removed through median filtering .",
    "two ccds were used : a @xmath20  pix mit - ll and a @xmath21  pix tektronix with pixel scales of 0.371 and 0.594  respectively at aat @xmath15 . in both cases ,",
    "individual fields were limited by a circular field stop of 9diameter .",
    "table  [ t : stepping ] summarizes the passband settings as used for scans in each spectral region .",
    "mean passbands with fwhm ( @xmath22 ) of 12.9 , 16.4 and 22.3     were used to cover 707/26 , 814/33 and 909/40 respectively . in velocity space",
    "the passbands had widths of 548 , 604 and 725  respectively .",
    "we would have preferred to maintain a fixed velocity width between wavelength windows although this proved difficult in practice since many of the ttf spectral regions were being wavelength - calibrated for the very first time during these observations .",
    "passbands were stepped in increments of @xmath23 as a compromise between velocity coverage and sampling continuity .",
    "table [ t : scans ] gives the observational characteristics for scans in each of the three spectral regions , in terms of  and . for ,",
    "the spectral regions sample redshift windows at @xmath1 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "note that the passbands used include the contribution of nearby  emission with .",
    "corresponding redshifts in the line are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , although we expect fewer galaxies at our flux limits .",
    "we attempted to compensate somewhat for the increased volume ( per scan ) represented at higher redshifts and longer wavelengths .",
    "as such , 7 fields were scanned in the 707/26 filter , 5 in the 814/33 and 3 in the 909/40 .",
    "this arrangement provided approximately equal volumes in  ( @xmath29 3 ) but a large range in  ( @xmath30  @xmath31 3 ) , because of the low  redshift for the 707/26 window .",
    "the only way to match the low and high redshift volumes in an efficient manner would be through a wide - field instrument such as an objective prism on a schmidt telescope . however , these are typically 6 magnitudes less - sensitive than ttf in the case of photographic surveys ( e.g.  @xcite  1994 ) and 4 magnitudes with the use of a ccd ( @xcite  2000 ) . for wide - field tunable filter searches ,",
    "the main limitation is the degradation of bandpass transmission that an interference device such as a tunable filter experiences in the fast beam of a wide - field instrument ( @xcite  1959 ) .",
    "@xcite  ( 2001 ) describe the design of a wide - field tunable lyot filter that avoids these difficulties .",
    "exposure times were typically 600  s per slice for the 707/26 and 814/33 scans and 1080  s per slice for the 909/40 scans .",
    "of the 13 nights obtained on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) during 1997 april  1998 april , 7 were photometric with reliable flux measurements .",
    "only scans taken under photometric conditions have been included .",
    "these exposure limits permit us to reach @xmath32  2band  as a @xmath33-detection in a 2  aperture , in our deepest exposures for the 909/40 interval .",
    "for a 20  bandpass , this flux is equivalent to @xmath34  or @xmath35 as broadband continuum .",
    "alternatively , if the @xmath32  2band  is confined solely to a _ line _ , ( with no other continuum ) , then this is equivalent to a broadband detection limit of @xmath36 . the instantaneous star - formation rate ( sfr ) scales directly with the  and  line luminosity . using the calibrations for  and  from the literature review of @xcite  ( 1998 ) we can determine the limiting star - formation rates of our sample .",
    "a limiting flux detection of @xmath37  2bandis sufficient to detect and measure star - formation rates of a few tenths , comparable with smc - type levels at the nearest redshifts and the lmc at @xmath38 .",
    "the narrowband scanning of ttf selects a galaxy sample that differs in two important ways from conventional redshift surveys .",
    "first , the narrowband technique produces a _ volume - limited _ sample of emission - line galaxies .",
    "the volume of redshift space covered is chosen by the observer through the range and placement of narrowbands .",
    "this differs from the broadband limit of conventional redshift surveys which allows galaxies from a wide range in redshift , making total volume a complex function of redshift .",
    "the second difference is that ttf selects objects through narrowband flux which is sensitive to the line flux and therefore star - formation rate .",
    "most conventional redshift surveys define emission - line sub - samples from the initial broadband - selected sample .",
    "the inclusion of a galaxy in such samples is dictated by the continuum of the combined stellar population and not by the instantaneous star - formation rate .",
    "to define a complete star - forming sample over a given volume , a narrow bandpass well - matched to flux detection in an emission - line is essential .",
    "since the ttf technique is without precedent we directed 9 of our fields to include emission - line galaxies found as part of the autofib galaxy redshift catalogue ( @xcite  1996 ) .",
    "the autofib catalogue contains over 1700 galaxies in the apparent magnitude range @xmath39 .",
    "since it is the combination of many optical surveys , emission - line galaxies are detected primarily through .",
    "of the ttf fields observed , there are 18 emission - line galaxies in the autofib catalogue with redshifts placing  in one of either the 707/26 , 814/33 or 909/40 blocking filters .",
    "we defined the autofib emission - line sample as those galaxies with  rest - frame equivalent widths ( rews ) greater than 10  . through the galaxies common to both catalogues",
    ", we can examine how representative a broadband - selected survey is of the underlying star - forming population .",
    "furthermore , we can gain insight into how the ttf detection rate goes as a function of broadband magnitude .",
    "table [ t : observations ] shows the observations undertaken for the _ ttf field galaxy survey_. the number of autofib galaxies expected in  is also included .",
    "figure [ figaitoff ] shows the distribution of fields on the sky .",
    "the fields overlapping with the autofib galaxies are indicated .",
    "we made a search of the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) to check whether any known clusters lie near our fields .",
    "no clusters with measured redshifts overlap with our fields although 4 of the optically - identified cluster candidates of @xcite  ( 1996 ) lie within 6  radius of our 10_3f , 13_3e , 10_3c and 10_3h field centres . within the @xcite sample , these cluster candidates are all rated with low significance .",
    "however , we later examine the number density and wavelength distribution of emission - line candidates within these fields as a check .",
    "all narrowband imaging emission - line searches are open to different lines at varying redshift .",
    "any line for which both the rest wavelength and source redshift act to place it within a ttf survey interval will be detected if sufficiently luminous .",
    "the fixed flux detection limit translates to different limiting luminosities in each emission - line , depending on its redshift .",
    "furthermore , the fixed wavelength coverage of the scan defines different co - moving volumes at each of the redshifts .",
    "this needs to be taken into account when optimising survey coverage , not just in terms of object density , but also in the _ type _ of emission - lines sought , since some are preferred to others for measuring star - formation rates ( @xcite  1992a , 1998 ) .    in a blind search at these wavelengths",
    "the emission - lines we would most expect to see in galaxies are , ,  and   ( @xcite  1999 ; @xcite 1999 ; @xcite  1992b ) .",
    "the ttf passband is too wide to separate  and at least one of .",
    "the detection of ly@xmath40 would be rare at the levels we are probing .",
    "recent estimates for the density of ly@xmath40 emission - line galaxies with line fluxes of 3 to @xmath41  number @xmath42  per unit @xmath43 ( @xcite  2000 ) .",
    "this implies negligible numbers of ly@xmath40-emitters at our brighter flux limit ( @xmath44  ) .",
    "is another line we do not expect to find since it is are too far into the red to be found in an appreciable volume . in any narrowband survey",
    ", we expect a competing luminosity - volume effect between  being probed to fainter luminosities over smaller volumes , and background emission - lines at brighter luminosities but larger volumes .",
    "is the most preferred line for measuring the instantaneous star - formation rate , being the strongest balmer recombination line and in the part of the optical spectrum affected least by extinction ( @xcite  1992a ; @xcite  1997 ; @xcite  1998 ; @xcite  1999 ) .",
    "it is directly related to the number of short - lived ob stars , indicative of the stellar birthrate in a galaxy .",
    "these hot , massive stars produce ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation that ionises the nearby gas to create an region .",
    "recombination produces the observed emission - lines and of these ,  most closely traces the amount of ionising uv flux . of the other balmer lines ,",
    "is weaker and prone to filling - in by the underlying stellar absorption .  can be also be related to the instantaneous star - formation rate , although the underlying assumptions are less robust , since this ( and other lines such as ,  and ) , depend heavily on the metal fraction of the gas ( @xcite  1992a ) . in the case of lines with a higher ionisation potential ,",
    "the energy of the incident uv flux is also an important factor . as a consequence , they are unreliable star - formation indicators .",
    "of all the optical lines ,  is the preferred choice .",
    "given the reasons outlined above ,  is the obvious target for our survey of star - formation .",
    "however , it is prudent for us to examine the numbers of background emission - line galaxies likely from a scanning narrowband survey .",

    "galaxy emission - line luminosity functions have been determined by several authors for h@xmath40 at a range of redshift ( @xcite  1995 ; @xcite  1998 ; @xcite  1998 ; @xcite  1999 ) . in most of these cases ,",
    "the  luminosity function is found to be well - matched by a @xcite  ( 1976 ) function , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of galaxies per unit volume at luminosity @xmath52 .",

    "as the  luminosity function evolves rapidly with redshift , we assumed an evolving @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath40 of the forms @xmath65 following the forms adopted by @xcite  ( 1997 ) for evolution in the broadband luminosity function .",
    "the free parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 were constrained by the luminosity functions of @xcite  ( 1995 ) at @xmath72 ( @xmath73 3 , @xmath74  , @xmath75 ) and @xcite  ( 1998 ) at @xmath76 ( @xmath77 3 , @xmath78  , @xmath79 ) .",

    "our best approach is to scale the   luminosities by the mean line flux ratios of @xcite  ( 1992a ) .",
    "kennicutt deliberately selected his sample of e - irr galaxies to match the mix of morphological types seen in the revised shapley - ames ( rsa ) catalog ( @xcite  1981 ) .",
    "as such , it can not be considered to be representative of the true space density these types .",
    "accordingly , we computed mean flux ratios for , , ,  and weighting @xcite s galaxy types by their occurrence . measurements of @xmath53 by @xcite  ( 1997 ) were used to estimate the relative space densities of different types and their evolution with redshift .",
    "figure  [ figkenevol ] shows that under such a weighting scheme , all line ratios show little change out to @xmath80 .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite  ( 1999 ) who find broad agreement between the /  ratios of their @xmath81 sample and the local @xcite  ( 1992a ) sample .",
    "the greatest change is the sharp decrease in /  ratios over @xmath82 .",
    "we suspect this is due to the steep decline in the numbers of early - type galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ figkenevol ] , _ inset _ ) , in which strong  emission is most prevalent ( @xcite  1986 ) .",
    "this constancy in line flux ratios is indeed what we might expect , given a field population composed almost exclusively of star - forming galaxies at such lookback times ( e.g.  @xcite  1996 ; @xcite  1999 ) .",
    "the effects of extinction aside , line ratios will only exhibit significant variation in cases of active galactic nuclei ( @xcite  1992a ) , for which @xcite  ( 1999 ) find no density evolution over @xmath83 and mild evolution between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "figure  [ figcontamevol ] shows the relative predicted numbers that our calculations yield for each of the 707/26 , 814/33 and 909/40 ttf spectral windows .",
    "numbers are shown as a function of flux for both individual flux bins ( fig .",
    "[ figcontamevol ] , _ left _ ) and cumulatively with decreasing flux ( fig .",
    "[ figcontamevol ] , _ right _ ) .",
    "we have assumed the galaxies to have a mean internal extinction of 1  mag at  and a mean /(@xmath86 ) flux ratio of 0.69 ( @xcite  1998 ) .",
    "note however that both @xcite and @xcite  ( 1999 ) find a trend in  flux against .",
    "we have not included this in the correction , since both surveys use slit spectroscopy ( 1.75  and 8  slits respectively ) which misses light from the outer regions of large galaxies in a way that narrowband imaging does not .",
    "the flux limits of our raw sample are @xmath87 to @xmath88  .",
    "as expected ,  galaxies dominate the cumulative numbers at the brightest fluxes because background galaxies in the other lines need to be intrinsically more luminous , and hence , much rarer objects . at the fainter fluxes ,",
    "we find a broader mix of emission - lines as the larger volumes sampled for the background lines begin to balance the fainter luminosity limits probed in",
    ".    around the flux limits of our survey ,  dominates over thereby representing more than 90%  of the full emission - line sample in the redder 814/33 and 909/40 bands . in the 707/26 band ,",
    "the   and  galaxies comprise approximately equal numbers ( @xmath89% ) with comparatively fewer numbers of galaxies seen in  and .",
    "the dominance of  at stronger fluxes in all bands suggests that samples restricted to these values will essentially constitute , with little contamination from background . in the case of 707/26 , this means truncating the emission - line sample artificially higher ( @xmath90 to @xmath91  ) than the natural flux limits of the survey .",
    "the trade - off is that there are far fewer galaxies with higher line fluxes . in short ,",

    "individual frames were bias - subtracted and divided by flatfields .",
    "night - sky rings were removed and images aligned and co - added in three separate scans . object detection and measurement was undertaken using  ( @xcite  1996 ) .",
    "objects were detected from the original frames and subsequently photometered from a matching set of frames degraded to match the worst seeing frame .",
    "cosmic - ray and ghost image catalogues were constructed for each scan and used to remove these detections from the raw emission - line candidate catalogues .",
    "emission - line candidates in which line flux was detected and continuum was not were selected by the line detections appearing in one or two adjacent frames and no others . these we term our _ line - only _ candidates .",
    "candidates showing line flux on an otherwise detectable continuum we call our _ line - on - continuum _ candidates .",
    "these were found through a more complex procedure .",
    "initially , all objects in the field with continuum detected in 5 or more frames had a straight - line of best - fit iteratively fit to the continuum flux with wavelength .",
    "fluxes deviant from this fit were rejected on successive iterations refining the fit .",
    "any objects showing flux deviations in one or two adjacent frames above the flux uncertainties of the continuum were included in the emission - line catalogue .",
    "all objects in this group ( in excess of @xmath93 ) were inspected on a mosaic of postage - stamp images ( through the scan ) to confirm the rejection of cosmic - rays and ghosts .",
    "the quality of the deviation above the fit was also checked to confirm the fit as true to the continuum and unaffected by bad data points . the continuum and emission - line fluxes in both sets",
    "were calibrated through standard star observations from the same nights .",
    "measured fluxes were corrected for extinction by our own galaxy ( albeit small since the fields were all at high galactic latitude ) and for flux truncation by the apertures where necessary .",
    "the specific procedures are described by @xcite  ( 1999 ) .",
    "figure  [ d13e7best ] shows example scans and ttf spectra for a subset of candidates from one of the _ ttf field galaxy survey _ fields .",
    "all of the objects shown are line - on - continuum candidates , for which the continuum flux has been fit in order to find the emission .",
    "preliminary and final continuum fits are shown in the spectra ( _ dotted _ and _ dashed _ lines respectively ) .",
    "one object ( 214.14 ) is one of the 18 autofib galaxies within our fields . in detection terms , the relative strength of an emission - line is quantified in terms of its _",
    "@xmath94-deviation_. this is the line flux in units of background @xmath94 . for line - only candidates , @xmath94 is the background rms of the local sky noise against which the detection was made .",
    "for example , a line - only detection with a @xmath94-deviation of 3 is a 3@xmath94-detection in the usual sense . for line - on - continuum candidates",
    ", the situation is complicated by the presence of continuum . in this case , the `` background @xmath94 '' is that determined by either the rms scatter of fluxes about the continuum fit , or the mean uncertainty in the continuum fluxes , whichever is greatest .",
    "hence , objects with strong emission flux might be rated with a low @xmath94-deviation if that emission is superposed on a continuum of comparable or greater strength .",
    "the @xmath94-deviation is an expression of the _ ease _ with which an emission - line was detected , not its strength in flux .",
    "the raw catalogue of emission - line candidates was selected from all objects with @xmath94-deviations of 3 or greater . at @xmath33 , those candidates seen as a peak in a single frame ideally require confirmation through a follow - up observation such as spectroscopy . figure  [ figlimits_sig ] shows the distribution of @xmath94-deviations for each field . the line - only detections ( _ horizontal tickmarks _ ) and line - on - continuum detections ( _ crosses _ ) are shown separately .",

    "[ figlimits_sig](@xmath95 ) and ( @xmath96 ) that from the point of view of detection , the majority of candidates ( @xmath97% ) are weak detections of between 3 and 4@xmath94 , as might be expected .",
    "most fields show a similar distribution of @xmath94-deviations with respect to each other .",
    "the exception is the 00_3a field which shows substantial numbers of strong @xmath94-deviation objects in both cases of object .",
    "we suspect that this may be due to either the field being observed under above - average conditions and/or a possible chance alignment with a galaxy cluster .",
    "we also note that this field has comparatively higher numbers of faint line - only detections , consistent with either hypothesis .",
    "finally , note that that there is a systematic offset between the limiting line flux of the line - only sample and its corresponding line - on - continuum sample for the same field .",
    "this is simply a reflection of the fact that a @xmath33-deviation detection seen against background sky can probe to fainter line levels than an equivalent detection measured against object continuum .",
    "these differences in sensitivity under different circumstances must be taken into account when deriving a homogeneous sub - sample of objects .",
    "the selection of a homogeneous sub - sample of emission - line candidates across many fields must necessarily take into account several observables simultaneously .",
    "there are many factors ( both external and intrinsic to an object ) that influence its detection probability . by _ homogeneous sub - sample _ ,",
    "we mean a sample of emission - line objects that conforms to a set of well - defined selection criteria , within which we know our sample is complete , or near complete . by _",
    "complete _ , we mean a 100% detection probability for all objects within a given set of selection criteria .",
    "the detection probability can be assessed by generating artificial datasets spanning similar object characteristics as the real sample .",
    "since the observational properties of the artificial objects are known from the outset , a success rate for detection can be measured when these objects are passed through the same selection methods as were used for the real objects .",
    "this can be used to assess the amount of incompleteness as a function of selection level and make for its correction . in practice ,",
    "selection cuts are placed at some threshold level , below which , the incompleteness corrections become intolerably large .",
    "corrections for incompleteness are made by weighting object numbers by the known missing fraction , provided the observed galaxy numbers are sufficiently large and the correction factors small .    in the _ ttf field galaxy survey _",
    ", all objects are first selected on the basis of a detection by , which becomes increasingly incomplete at the faintest limits .",
    "the line - only candidates are subject to this alone whereas the line - on - continuum objects undergo further selection on the basis of line flux relative to continuum .",
    "the detection probability of both procedures must be measured before we can set bounds to define a homogeneous sub - sample .",
    "the bounds should be such that we can combine both types of object into a single uniform catalogue , within which the differences in selection method are no longer important .",
    "we examined the detection probabilities for the fields observed in cases of worst seeing and/or highest sky background .",
    "images were constructed containing artificial objects under identical conditions of seeing and background rms as the real observations .",

    "although such follow - up is beyond the scope of this paper , it is the obvious direction for subsequent work on the survey .",
    "an alternative solution to redshift ambiguity was explored in the form of broadband imaging .",
    "as the major optical emission - lines are well - separated in wavelength , the corresponding galaxy redshifts separate the broadband colors unambiguously in a color - color plane .",

    "such colors can then be used to solve the galaxy redshift ambiguity .",
    "more details on the application and results of this approach are presented by @xcite  ( 1999 ) . however , because the brightest galaxies were too few to be useful , this method could not be applied as a redshift discriminant to the _ ttf field galaxy survey _ as a whole .",
    "we tested the ttf detection of emission - line galaxies against a conventional broadband - selected redshift sample .",

    "the agreement in panel ( @xmath96 ) indicates that the scatter in the equivalent width measurements of panel ( @xmath95 ) is due primarily to the dispersion in line flux seen in panel ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ contfit ] ) implies that the _ continuum _ detection limit of ttf is about the same as the @xmath131 limit of the broadband - selected survey .    there is little overlap between the emission - line selected galaxies found in the the broadband - selected autofib redshift survey and the _ ttf field galaxy survey_. the vast majority of ttf - selected galaxies have continua too faint for inclusion in the broadband catalogue while the redshifts of the autofib line - emitters are too wide - ranging for the relatively narrow scan windows of ttf .",
    "for the galaxies in common , ttf detects the brighter autofib galaxies ( @xmath132 ) in both line and continuum while fainter line - emitters are almost exclusively detected in the line alone .",
    "while there is good agreement between the redshifts and continuum fluxes measured by ttf and autofib around  and , there is considerable scatter between the measurements of line flux and equivalent width .",
    "however , much of this dispersion can be attributed to intrinsic differences between the  and  lines themselves , as seen in the loose correlations between these lines by @xcite  ( 1992a ) and @xcite  ( 1999 ) .",
    "improved insight into the relative merits of ttf over broadband - selected emission - line samples would be obtained through a redshift survey with near - infrared spectra overlapping with the ttf wavelength intervals directly , so that the same emission - line could be observed by each technique .      previously ( sect .",

    "a second effect could be that the model constraints at @xmath140 ( @xcite  1995 ) and @xmath141 ( @xcite  1998 ) are insufficient for the extrapolation to @xmath142 where  is seen in the 909/40 interval",

    "@xcite  ( 2001 ) have obtained follow - up spectroscopy to a sample of ttf - selected emission - line galaxies in the field of qso mrc  b0450@xmath8221 at @xmath154 .",
    "of the 5 ttf candidates targetted , 3 were positively identified as emission - line sources , and 1 as a possible emission - line detection .",
    "this important result demonstrates the capacity of ttf for detecting faint emission - line sources at high redshift .    a more immediate approach to evolutionary trends is to compare  luminosity functions directly .",
    "figure  [ figlfdn ] shows the luminosity functions of our homogeneous  sub - samples in each interval for the @xmath137 ( _ filled circles _ ) sample .",
    "the  luminosity functions of @xcite  ( 1995 ; _ open triangles _ ) and @xcite  ( 1998 ; _ open circles _ ) are also shown in the relevant redshift interval .",
    "all luminosity functions are shown uncorrected for extinction .",
    "poissonian errors derived from the square - root of the galaxy numbers in each bin are shown .",
    "for the ttf data ,  fluxes were corrected for the effect of  using the mean flux ratio /(@xmath86 )  @xmath133 , obtained by @xcite  ( 1998 ) for their sample at @xmath141 .",
    "star - formation rates were derived using the same calibration as adopted by @xcite  ( 1999 ) , namely @xmath155 from the @xcite  ( 1996 ) models with solar metallicity and a salpeter imf .",
    "no extinction corrections have been applied to the luminosities , although corrections have been made for the effect of the airy profile on sampling an ensemble of galaxy line fluxes ( @xcite  1999 ) .",
    "we save the derivation of a luminosity function fit for when we have spectroscopic confirmation of the  sample in hand .",
    "figure  [ figlfdn](@xmath125 ) demonstrates the excess in our @xmath1 counts over the faint - end of the @xcite  ( 1995 ) distribution by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "much closer agreement exists between our values and those of a preliminary  luminosity function from the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss ; gronwall  2000 , priv .",
    "comm ) . taken together ,",
    "these results suggest that the @xcite survey underestimates the faint - end of the local  luminosity function , and hence , the star - formation content of the local universe . for the @xmath156 interval ( fig .  [",
    "figlfdn]@xmath95 ) we find broad agreement with the  luminosity function derived by @xcite  ( 1998 ) . due to the volume - limited nature of the survey",
    "we have insufficient numbers to define the bright - end `` knee '' of the distribution . our measurements at @xmath157 ( fig .",
    "[ figlfdn]@xmath96 ) are the first to use  in the @xmath112  gyr of lookback time separating the samples of @xcite  ( 1998 ) at @xmath141 and @xcite  ( 1999 ) at @xmath158 .",
    "our preliminary  luminosity functions argue for an upwards revision of the star - formation content for the local universe .",
    "this in turn implies a less - dramatic decline in the cosmic star - formation history than has been shown to date ( @xcite  1998 ; @xcite  1999 ; @xcite  1999 ) .",
    "however , follow - up spectroscopy is needed to confirm the nature of the  detections and to correct individual  fluxes for the effects of extinction and . indeed ,",
    "if many of our sub-@xmath139-detections are verified , then the measured excess would be greater .",
    "we now summarize our preliminary findings from a census of the _ ttf field galaxy survey _ for star - forming galaxies .    1 .",
    "using the taurus tunable filter ( ttf ) , we have obtained a narrowband - selected sample of emission - line galaxies in the field .",
    "the survey is composed of 15 scans of 10 narrowband slices covering 0.27  on the sky , with 7 of the scans in a 707/26  nm wavelength interval , 5 in 814/33  nm and 3 in 909/40  nm .",
    "there are 696 candidates ( at the @xmath33 level or greater ) in a homogeneous sub - sample for which we can correct for incompleteness ( 96.4% ) .",
    "although some detections ( 13 ) are confirmed by the autofib galaxy redshift survey , the majority exist without separate confirmation .",
    "this is required for both checking the validity of detections and correctly identifying the emission - line concerned .",
    "the homogeneous sub - sample excludes two of the worst fields , one in each of the 707 and 909 intervals . through a synthesis of luminosity functions and median galaxy emission - line ratios",
    ", we estimate the relative occurrence of different emission - lines in our sample . from this",
    "we expect our samples to be dominated by  galaxies in the sub - samples with line fluxes exceeding 1.50 , 0.71 and @xmath109   for the 707 , 814 and 909 intervals respectively . in these flux regimes , we have 660 candidates from the homogeneous sub - sample that we expect to consist mostly of  galaxies , correctable for the small amount of incompleteness ( 96.5% ) inherent .",
    "we find little evidence for strong clustering in either the full emission - line sample or the  subset .",
    "those of our fields overlapping with the @xcite  ( 1996 ) cluster candidates did not yield any clear peaks in redshift space .",
    "this allows us to rule out clusters in our field sample as seen in emission - lines .",
    "it does not , of course , tell us anything about possible clusters outside of our scan intervals but in the same direction on the sky .",
    "we compared the detection ability of ttf in finding emission - line galaxies to the broadband - selected autofib galaxy redshift survey ( @xcite  1996 ) .",
    "our comparison was made between the  galaxies found in autofib and the  galaxies of ttf .",
    "there is little overlap between the emission - line samples of the two surveys . for the sky regions that overlap ,",
    "most of the ttf - selected galaxies are not seen in the autofib catalogue because they have continua beyond the selection limit of this catalogue .",
    "conversely , ttf misses many of the autofib emission - line galaxies because they are beyond the comparatively narrow volumes sampled by ttf . for the galaxies in common",
    ", ttf detects @xmath132 galaxies in both line and continuum while fainter galaxies are detected in the line alone .",
    "ttf recovered 13 of an expected 18 autofib emission - line galaxies , although those that were missed may have been due to weaker emission than .",
    "the two surveys agree in their continuum and redshift measurements although show scatter in their line flux and equivalent width measures",
    ". however , much of this scatter may be due to intrinsic scatter in the correlation of  and  fluxes .",
    "better insight into the detection rates of the two methods would be gained through a direct comparison concentrating on the same emission - line at wavelengths common to both .",
    "the projected density of emission - line galaxies on the sky was compared to what we would have expected from existing measurements of the  luminosity function . at the faintest limits we find a significant excess in these narrowband number counts , up to 3 times the expected counts at the faintest flux limits of our @xmath137 sample .",
    "this excess is also seen when our preliminary  luminosity functions are compared directly to those of other surveys , in each redshift interval individually . although the influence of false detections for the line - only candidates is yet to be quantified , our visual confirmation of the line - on - continuum candidates ( 13% ) is consistent with an excess of emission - line candidates .",
    "such an excess is most likely due to our narrowband selection of the sample , which is without precedent for field emission - line galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "the greater numbers imply higher star - formation densities than have previously been attributed to these epochs .",
    "however , follow - up measurement of the detections is required to quantify this increase .",
    "multi - object spectroscopic follow - up is necessary for future work on this sample .",
    "such spectra would cover a wider wavelength range than ttf , and as such , would allow us to resolve many of the issues for which we have presently made assumptions .",
    "spectroscopic information would first allow independent confirmation of the line detections and resolve the redshift ambiguity .",
    "furthermore , with spectra we can determine the amount of reddening in individual galaxies through the /ratio and correct each for such .",
    "if the spectra are of sufficiently high spectral resolution , the  and  lines can be separated , thereby avoiding contamination of the former by the latter . furthermore , the  line fluxes could be measured directly from the line which would remove the need for the bandpass correction .",
    "finally , through an assessment of ratios such as /  and /  we could identify and reject agn from our sample of star - forming galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite  1987 ) .",
    "many existing  surveys ( e.g.  @xcite  1998 ; @xcite  1999 ) include these emission - line sources , although they occur in small numbers relative to the general star - forming population .    in short , the _ ttf field galaxy survey _",
    "is a survey for star - forming galaxies is largely unprecedented in its systematic narrowband seach for field galaxies .",
    "our data suggest galaxy counts and mean star - formation rates higher than those measured by previous  and uv surveys .",
    "an intriguing possibility for the higher values we observe is a population of faint star - forming galaxies , with continua sufficiently faint to place them beyond the range of conventional redshift surveys .",
    "however , follow - up measurements utilizing multi - object spectroscopy are required for this to be confirmed .",
