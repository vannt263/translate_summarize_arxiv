    "recently , in unrefined topological string theory on non - compact toric calabi - yau threefolds , the free energy including non - perturbative effects is proposed @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative parts can be obtained by considering the nekrasov ",
    "shatashvili limit @xcite .",
    "we call this as  non - perturbative free energy \" .",
    "the non - perturbative free energy is finite for any string coupling by the hmo cancellation mechanism @xcite .",
    "this free energy has been studied in various situations @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "especially , it is known that this free energy is closely related to the quantization of a mirror curve for the non - compact toric calabi - yau threefold @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "this provides us with the non - perturbative definition of the topological string .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the important properties of the perturbative topological string hold , even if we consider the non - perturbative topological string .    in this paper",
    ", we study a geometric transition @xcite@xcite@xcite in the non - perturbative topological string . as an example , we study the geometric transition in the closed topological string on the local @xmath0 .",
    "we consider two cases .",
    "one is the geometric transition from the local @xmath0 to the resolved conifold in the closed topological string .",
    "the other is the geometric transition from the closed topological string on the local @xmath0 to the open topological string on the resolved conifold with a toric a - brane .",
    "we first consider the geometric transition from the local @xmath0 to the resolved conifold in the closed topological string .",
    "then , we find that , by calculating the non - perturbative free energy of the closed topological string on the local @xmath0 and the resolved conifold , the geometric transition can be applied even if the non - perturbative effects are included .",
    "we also find that , in contrast with the case of the perturbative free energy , the values of the khler parameters which the geometric transition occurs are corrected by the non - perturbative effects .",
    "next , we consider the geometric transition from the closed topological string to the open topological string with a toric a - brane . then , we find that the hmo cancellation mechanism can be applied , even if there is a toric a - brane .",
    "we also find that the non - perturbative parts of this free energy have the same structure as the one in the references @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we check this statement up to @xmath1 .",
    "the khler parameters are corrected by the non - perturbative effects as in the above case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we calculate the non - perturbative free energy of the closed topological string on the local @xmath0 by using the refined topological vertex formalism @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in section 3 , we consider the geometric transition from the local @xmath0 to the resolved conifold in the closed topological string . we also consider the geometric transition which the toric a - brane occurs .",
    "finally , we summarize our result and discuss the future work in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we calculate the non - perturbative free energy of the closed topological string on the local @xmath0 . we also check the hmo cancellation mechanism for this free energy .      in order to calculate the non - perturbative free energy",
    ", we use the refined topological vertex formalism .",
    "the web diagram of the local @xmath0 is shown in fig.[localb3 ] , where we define @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the khler parameters .    .",
    "( b ) is its building blocks.,width=566 ]    then , we can write the partition function of the refined topological string on this geometry @xmath4 as follow : @xmath5 where we define @xmath6 ( [ z1 ] ) and ( [ z2 ] ) correspond to the building blocks of the left side and the right side in fig.[localb3](b ) , respectively .",
    "we also define the refined topological vertex @xmath7 and the framing factors @xmath8 , @xmath9 as follows : @xmath10 where the function @xmath11 is the skew schur function . by using some formulae in appendix",
    ", we obtain @xmath12 in order to clarify the discussion in next section , we normalize ( [ unnorm1 ] ) and ( [ unnorm2 ] ) by dividing the trivial building blocks @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "again by using some formulae , we obtain    @xmath15    thus the partition function @xmath4 is as follow : @xmath16      now we define the perturbative free energy of the refined topological string @xmath17 and the unrefined topological string @xmath18 as follows : @xmath19,~f_{\\text{ws}}(q;q)=f(q;q).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , we define the perturbative parts of the non - perturbative free energy as @xmath20 note that we redefine the khler parameters due to the hmo cancellation .",
    "the non - perturbative parts of the non - perturbative free energy are obtained by using the nekrasov ",
    "shatashvili limit of the refined topological string @xcite , @xmath21 then , the non - perturbative parts of the free energy @xmath22 are defined as follow : @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "thus the non - perturbative free energy of the topological string on the local @xmath0 @xmath26 is as follow : @xmath27 in this case , @xmath26 is finite for any @xmath28 or @xmath29 . for example , when we set @xmath30 , then we obtain @xmath31 more general discussion for this pole cancellations is written in the reference @xcite .",
    "in this section , we consider the geometric transition .",
    "we first consider the geometric transition from the local @xmath0 to the resolved conifold . in order to know how to set the khler parameters to occur this geometric transition",
    ", we consider the geometric transition in the perturbative topological string in the beginning . after the consideration , we consider the geometric transition in the non - perturbative topological string .",
    "then , we find that the non - perturbative free energy after the geometric transition agrees with the one on the resolved conifold which is obtained in the reference @xcite .",
    "we also find that the khler parameters are corrected by the non - perturbative effects .",
    "we next consider the geometric transition from the local @xmath0 to the resolved conifold with a toric a - brane .",
    "as is the above case , we consider the geometric transition in the perturbative topological string in the beginning . after the consideration , we consider the geometric transition in the non - perturbative topological string .",
    "then , we find that the non - perturbative parts of this free energy after the geometric transition have the same structure as the one in the reference @xcite .      in this subsection , we consider the geometric transition from the local @xmath0 to the resolved conifold in the closed string .          to begin with , we consider how to set the khler parameters to special values in the refined topological string . according to the reference @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite",
    ", we set the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 as follows : @xmath34 then , the factors in @xmath35 @xmath36 become zero unless the young diagram @xmath37 becomes empty .",
    "then , after several cancellation , we obtain @xmath38 this expression agrees with the partition function of the closed topological string on the resolved conifold except for the factors @xmath39 .",
    "thus , in unrefined case , this geometric transition occurs when we set @xmath40 the same can be said of the perturbative free energy by the relation between the partition function and the free energy .          in this subsection",
    ", we consider the geometric transition from the closed topological string on the local @xmath0 to the open topological string on the resolved conifold with a toric a - brane .",
    "we consider again the refined topological string in the beginning .",
    "according to the reference @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , we set the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 as follows : @xmath46 then , as we said in previous section , the young diagram @xmath37 becomes empty .",
    "thus , by using the expressions ( [ norm1 ] ) and ( [ norm2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath47    in order to check the consistency , we calculate the partition function of the open topological string on the resolved conifold with a toric a - brane . its web diagram is shown in fig.[geomtransopen ] .",
    "then we write the partition function from the web diagram as follow : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the holonomy matrix .",
    "since there is a single a - brane , the matrix @xmath49 is the one by one matrix , @xmath50 then , we obtain @xmath51 then , ( [ zclosedopen ] ) agrees with ( [ eq : zopen ] ) under the relation between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 except for the factors @xmath55 .",
    "thus , in the perturbative topological string , the geometric transition occurs when we set @xmath56        thus , we obtain the non - perturbative free energy of the open topological string on the resolved conifold with a toric a - brane , @xmath62 this free energy is finite for any @xmath28 or @xmath29 by the hmo cancellation mechanism . for example , when we set @xmath63 , the free energy @xmath64 becomes @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the geometric transition in the non - perturbative topological string in two cases : one is the geometric transition from the local @xmath0 to the resolved conifold . the other is the geometric transition from the local @xmath0 to the resolved conifold with a toric a - brane .",
    "then we have found that the geometric transition can be applied , even if the non - perturbative effects are included .",
    "we also find that the khler parameters are corrected by the non - perturbative effects . in the open topological string ,",
    "the non - perturbative free energy which we have obtained has had the same structure as the one in the reference @xcite .",
    "we have various future work .",
    "first of all , considering the general formula of the non - perturbative open topological string would be interesting",
    ". its structure would be similar to the free energy of the closed topological string which is derived in the reference @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we have considered the open topological string with a toric a - brane .",
    "then we want to consider the open topological string in the presence of @xmath67 a - branes . we would be able to use the geometric transition to obtain this free energy . in this case",
    ", we set the khler parameters as follows , @xmath68 where the variables @xmath69 correspond to the positions of the a - branes .",
    "the justification of this parameter choices would be important .    in terms of the mirror curve",
    ", we consider the mirror curve of genus 1 in this paper .",
    "then , naively we can derive the mirror curve of genus 0 by using the geometric transition . on the other hand , according to the reference @xcite , the quantization of mirror curve relates to the free energy of topological string on the toric calabi - yau manifold associated with the mirror curve .",
    "however there is a crucial problem . for the quantization of mirror curve of genus 0 , the expectation value of the trace class operator which is defined by the quantization of the mirror curve diverges since the spectrum of this operator is continuous .",
    "then , by using our result and the mirror symmetry @xcite@xcite , we might obtain the finite expectation value for the mirror curve of genus 0 by setting some parameters in the expectation value of the mirror curve of genus 1 whose expectation value is finite .",
    "the above discussion about the mirror curve can be applied to the open string .",
    "then , the free energy of the open topological string might be able to relate to the quantization of mirror curve",
    ". it would be also interesting to consider this .",
    "i would like to thank satoshi yamaguchi and sanefumi moriyama for discussions and comments .",
    "i also would like to thank taro kimura for discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we summarize the definitions and the formulae which we use in this paper .    * the refined topological vertex @xmath70 * the gluing factors @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the skew schur function .",
    "we also define the young diagram @xmath73 as following figure [ young ] .     as fig .",

    "we also write some useful formulae .    * some formulas about schur polynomial @xmath77 * normalization @xmath78",
    "the free energy of the unrefined closed topological string on the local @xmath0 is as follow : @xmath80      the ns limit for the free energy of the closed topological string on the local @xmath0 is as follow : @xmath81",
    "in this section , we show that the non - perturbative parts of the free energy of the local @xmath0 become the one of the resolved conifold after setting the khler parameters to ( [ closed t1 ] ) and ( [ closed t2 ] ) .",
    "we first consider some derivatives .",
