    "high @xmath1 multi - strange baryons are likely to be a result of fragmentation after initial state hard scattering and thus probe the early times of the collision volume .",
    "hard parton scattering will often result in back - to - back jets , which produce particles highly correlated in the same jet cone or the others on the opposite side .",
    "since a complete jet reconstruction in central _ au+au _ collisions is impossible due to the high multiplicity environment , we use statistical reconstruction of strange - particle jets by measuring azimuthal correlations of high @xmath1 @xmath3 baryons with high @xmath1 charged tracks on an event - by - event basis .",

    "@xcite . both _ p+p _ and _ d+au _ data are suitable as a reference for a _ au+au",

    "this article presents the foundation of such a reference study .",
    "for the study presented in this article 14 m minimum bias _ p+p _ events ( year 2002 data ) and 20 m minimum bias _",
    "d+au _ events ( year 2003 data ) are used .",
    "the main component of the star detector used for this analysis is its large time projection chamber ( tpc ) @xcite , which has a 2@xmath4 azimuthal coverage and pseudorapidity ( @xmath8 ) range @xmath9 . complementing the star tpc , the central trigger barrel ( ctb )",
    "was also used in this study @xcite .",
    "the tracks are reconstructed in the tpc , while the high rate capability of the ctb is used to ensure the correlated particles come from the same event .",
    "one challenge in a correlation analysis is to find enough events where a correlation is topologically feasible . in _",
    "collisions , the physics of the reaction and the efficiency of the detector allow for topological reconstruction @xcite of only approximately three @xmath10 or @xmath11 per @xmath12 events . only a fraction of these trigger @xmath3 particles have @xmath1 greater than the minimum cut - off used in this study : 2 gev / c per particle . the low mean multiplicity of a",
    "_ p+p _ event ( 5.5 tracks ) makes it difficult to find suitable correlation partners , therefore the associated particle cut - off is set low at 1.5 gev / c .    to make a correlation between a @xmath3 baryon and a high @xmath1 track in a given event one first applies loose selections to find potential @xmath10 and @xmath11 particles in each event",
    "secondly , one looks for single tracks that would pass a given @xmath1 cut - off .",
    "the background decreases as the @xmath1 cut - off is raised . after a list of eligible tracks and @xmath3 candidates is made , each @xmath3 is used as a trigger particle for correlations .",

    "the azimuthal angle ( @xmath13 ) between the @xmath3 and a high @xmath1 track is calculated and plotted .",
    "after analyzing the entire event sample , the correlation function is normalized by the number of trigger particles and fit with two gaussians constrained to wrap around @xmath14 .",

    "performing the identical analysis described above for the data , one finds that with 1921 @xmath3 trigger particles there are 705 @xmath3-charged hadron correlations , with 1.4 correlations per correlated particle ( table  [ mytable ] ) .",
    "in other words , if a @xmath10 was correlated , more than a third of the time it correlated with more than one track in the same event . the resultant correlation is shown in fig .",
    "[ pythiacorr ] , where a clear same - side and a distinct away - side peak are seen .",
    "the same - side peak obtained in this simulation contains 12% more correlations than the away - side peak , and is 33% higher .",
    "although correlations are observed in both the _ p+p _ data and that of simulated particles from pythia , a comparison of the two spectra shows that the simulation does not reproduce the data .",
    "while the pythia integrated yield is higher ( dn / dy = 0.00318 for pythia , dn / dy = @xmath20 the _ p+p _ data @xcite ) , it grossly underpredicts the yields in the region of interest ( @xmath21 gev / c ) , at the same time overstating the yields below @xmath1 = 0.8 gev / c ( fig .  [ ppspectra ] ) .",
    "this might be altered by adjusting various pythia parameters , such as tuning the hard processes parameters and allowing for parton rescattering , or making nlo pqcd calculations .    after performing a simulation ,",
    "we proceed to examine characteristics of events containing a @xmath3 to learn about the environment for production of high @xmath1 @xmath3 baryons in elementary processes .",
    "one characteristic is the number of valid primary tracks found in an event ( event multiplicity ) .",
    "a valid primary track in this study is a track reconstructed with more than 15 ( out of possible 46 ) fit points , and which comes within 3 cm of the primary collision vertex .",
    "preliminary studies indicate that indeed , the multiplicity of an event with a reconstructed @xmath3 particle differs significantly from that of an average minimum bias sample event . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ refmultvspt ] , the mean multiplicity of an event with a @xmath3 produced and reconstructed is almost twice as high as the mean multiplicity of 5.5 primary tracks per event .",
