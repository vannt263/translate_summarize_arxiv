    "an interesting feature of the phase diagram in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the possible existence of the critical point ( cp ) , which is predicted by various effective models of qcd and suggested by lattice qcd simulations .",
    "the critical point is the end point of the first order phase transition line existing in the low temperature ( @xmath3 ) region @xcite @xcite , although the very existence of a cp may be questioned according to @xcite . ] .",
    "then , the significance of this qcd cp is that the phase transition at this point is of second order , and thereby we can expect critical phenomena due to large fluctuations of various quantities at this point @xcite .    then , a fundamental problem arises ; what is the soft modes of the qcd cp ?",
    "a hint is that the baryon - number susceptibility @xcite diverges at the cp as first suggested in @xcite and subsequently demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "it has been established that the fluctuating modes of conserved densities are the soft modes at the cp @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath4 mode seems to be the soft mode , it couples to the density fluctuation at finite density @xcite and remains massive @xcite near the qcd cp is called a slaved mode @xcite , because its slow dynamics is controlled by the density fluctuation for the qcd cp . ] .",
    "furthermore , as a critical phenomenon , some authors suggested a divergent behavior of bulk viscosity at the qcd cp @xcite , although their validity of their argument is very much controversial @xcite ; for instance , the ansatz for the spectral function adopted in @xcite may not necessarily be true @xcite , and a microscopic calculation by the relativistic boltzmann equation @xcite shows that the bulk viscosity is finite at the cp .",
    "thus , it is still not obvious whether the transport coefficients will diverge at the qcd cp .",
    "in fact , as is known in condensed matter physics , the critical divergence of the transport coefficients is a common phenomenon at a cp , such as at the liquid - gas cp , and originate from a universal mechanism ; nonlinear fluctuations of _ macroscopic _ variables cause the divergence @xcite .",
    "this implies that microscopic processes , as may be described by such as the boltzmann equation , would give only a minor contribution to the critical divergence of these quantities , if any .",
    "the dynamic renormalization group ( rg ) theory @xcite is a standard technique for critical dynamics , which systematically incorporate the macroscopic fluctuations causing the divergent behavior of transport coefficients . in this theory",
    ", we must construct a nonlinear langevin equation as a basic equation for the critical dynamics .",
    "the construction goes as follows .",
    "first , the slow variables are identified for describing the critical dynamics .",
    "next , the thermodynamic potential for the slow variables is constructed to determine the static property of the system .",
    "finally , the streaming terms , causing the dynamic - nonlinear coupling , and the kinetic coefficients are determined for respectively describing time reversible and irreversible changes of the slow variables .",
    "we note that the streaming term is absent in the simple brownian motion .",
    "the general theory of the critical dynamics as described above tells us that an essential ingredient is to properly construct the nonlinear langevin equation for the critical dynamics .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first attempt for the qcd cp .",
    "our construction of the langevin equation is based on the generalized langevin theory , by mori @xcite , and the _ relativistic _ hydrodynamics , because the slow variables are identified as long - wavelength fluctuations of the conserved densities @xcite ; we construct the streaming terms from continuity equations and the potential condition , which is a general condition for streaming terms @xcite . also , we use the thermodynamic potential for the 3d ising system as that for the qcd cp because the static universality class is the same as 3d ising class @xcite . finally , we determine the kinetic coefficients from a relativistic hydrodynamic equation , here the so called landau equation @xcite taken . in consequence , we shall show that the langevin equation differs from it for the liquid - gas cp due to relativistic effects , although the dynamic universality class of the qcd cp is conjectured as of the liquid - gas cp @xcite .",
    "after such construction , we apply the dynamic rg to the langevin equation and derive the rg equations for the transport coefficients . consequently , to our surprise , these rg equations turn out to be the same as for the liquid - gas cp except for a irrelevant constant , although the langevin equations are different .",
    "therefore , the bulk viscosity and the thermal conductivity strongly diverge and can be more important than the shear viscosity near the qcd cp .",
    "we shall also show that the thermal and viscous diffusion modes exhibits critical slowing down , whereas the sound mode critical speeding up .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii ,",
    "we shortly review the theory of critical dynamics . in sec.iii",
    ", we construct the nonlinear langevin equation for the qcd cp by the generalized langevin theory and the relativistic hydrodynamics . in sec.iv",
    ", we analyze the critical exponents of the transport coefficients and dynamic critical exponents by the dynamic rg .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary and concluding remarks . in appendixes [ sec :",
    "derivation ] , [ sec : rg1 ] and [ sec : rg2 ] , we give the detailed derivation of the rg equations for the transport coefficients .",
    "since the present work is based on the theory of critical dynamics in condensed matter physics @xcite , we now shortly review it for self - containedness .",
    "the critical divergence of transport coefficients ( or diffusion constants ) is a common phenomenon , for instance , at the critical point of the liquid - gas , ferromagnetic transitions and so on @xcite .",
    "the important point is that the critical divergence originates from a universal mechanism ; nonlinear fluctuations of macroscopic variables causes the divergence @xcite .    here ,",
    "we briefly illustrate how macroscopic nonlinear fluctuations cause the critical divergence , taking the thermal conductivity near the liquid - gas cp as an example @xcite .",
    "the thermal conductivity is given by the kubo formula as follows , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath3 are the heat current and temperature , respectively , and @xmath7 denotes the statistical average in the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "the heat current @xmath6 is supplied from two sources : one is due to a microscopic process as calculated by a microscopic theory , such as the boltzmann equation , and the other is due to nonlinear fluctuations of macroscopic variables @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively denote the microscopic and macroscopic currents .",
    "the macroscopic process causing the heat current is identified as the entropy density convected by fluid velocity fluctuation .",
    "thus , we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively denote the fluctuations of the entropy density and the fluid velocity . the macroscopic current eq .",
    "( [ eq : hc ] ) is of the second order in fluctuations and hence negligible far from the cp .",
    "however , it becomes the dominant part near the cp , since the fluctuations are enhanced there .",
    "we see that eq .",
    "( [ eq : heat - kubo ] ) now has the following form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the thermal conductivity coming from the microscopic current . recalling that the entropy density fluctuation is a soft mode near the liquid - gas cp",
    ", we see that the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc ] ) diverges at the cp .",
    "this is the mechanism causing the critical divergence of transport coefficients .",
    "let us call the transport coefficients , such as @xmath15 , coming from microscopic processes the bare transport coefficients , and those including the contributions from the nonlinear macroscopic fluctuations the renormalized ones .",
    "then , we need not to study the critical divergence of transport coefficients by a microscopic theory since the divergence originates from only the macroscopic processes .",
    "the dynamic rg @xcite is the standard theory incorporating such nonlinear macroscopic fluctuations . in this theory",
    ", we must construct a nonlinear langevin equation as a basic equation for the critical dynamics .",
    "we first note that if the dynamic variables are divided into slow and fast ones , the slow dynamics can be well described by a langevin equation .",
    "we stress that such the langevin equation can be derived in a generic way , so - called the mori theory @xcite , from the microscopic equation of motion .",
    "the starting microscopic equations of motion are liouville or hisenberg equation for a classical or a quantum system , respectively .",
    "they read @xmath16 and @xmath17 , \\label{eq : hisenberg}\\ ] ] respectively . here , @xmath18 are arbitrary slowly varying variables ( slow variables ) , @xmath19 a microscopic hamiltonian , and , @xmath20 and @xmath21 $ ] represent poisson brackets and commutation relations , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ eq : liouville ] ) ( or eq .",
    "( [ eq : hisenberg ] ) ) can be divided into two parts : one is composed of only the slow variables and describes their slow motion , while the other involves fast motions due to the microscopic processes .",
    "thus , we have @xcite @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the inverse temperature . here , @xmath24 , which is called a streaming term , gives the time - reversible process , while @xmath25 and @xmath26 are bare kinetic coefficients and a thermodynamic potential for @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nllangevin ] ) are the slow motions and nonlinear in @xmath27 , whereas the last term is the fast motions and treated as a stochastic variable obeying the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath28 here , @xmath29 represents the conditional average in which @xmath27 is fixed at @xmath30 .",
    "we stress that this relation is not given by hand , but naturally obtained from the decomposition process @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : nllangevin ] ) is called the generalized langevin equation , which has been widely used in the phase transition dynamics @xcite . even for the qcd cp",
    ", we may use the generalized langevin equation , because only the time - scale separation is assumed in the mori theory .",
    "furthermore , we note that , by the time - scale separation , transport coefficients arises .",
    "the general dynamic rg transformation usually consists of two procedures , i.e. , coarse graining and rescaling as in the static rg transformation @xcite .",
    "however , as is shown in @xcite , we can omit the rescaling , if we are interested in only the critical exponents of transport coefficients , although the relevant fixed point seems to be absent in such a simplified rg transformation @xcite .",
    "the langevin equation is an infrared effective theory and inherently has a ultraviolet cutoff @xmath31 , which should satisfy the following inequality @xmath32 here , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the correlation length and the characteristic microscopic length , respectively .",
    "then , the langevin equation is coarse grained by averaging over the large - wavenumber components of the slow variables @xmath35 in the infinitesimal wavenumber shell , @xmath36 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : nllangevin ] ) .",
    "here , @xmath37 starts from the initial value @xmath31 and is lowered up to @xmath38 . in this way",
    ", we infinitesimally make coarse graining of the langevin equation . because the coarse - graining procedure is infinitesimal ,",
    "we need not the rescaling . inspecting the form of the coarse - grained langevin equation ,",
    "we can obtain the rg equation for the transport coefficients .      here , we first stress that the concept of the dynamic universality class is not so universal contrary to its name .",
    "then , the class of the qcd cp may not be the same as of the liquid - gas cp or the model h , although it is conjectured by @xcite . to see this ,",
    "let us contrast the difference between the static rg with the dynamic one .",
    "an important point is that the respective infrared effective theories are different ; in the static case , the infrared effective theory is the thermodynamic potential ( or so - called landau free energy ) , the nature of which turns out to be governed by only the space dimension and the symmetry among the order parameters but not by the details of the dynamics , and hence the concept of the universality class makes sense for the static case . in contrast , for the dynamic rg , the infrared effective theory is the nonlinear langevin equation .    here",
    ", the important difference arises ; the relevant variables for the langevin equation is not only the order parameters but also conserved densities , and its nonlinear couplings can not be determined by only the symmetry in general .",
    "consequently , the dynamic universality class is not so universal compared to the static one . specifically , the nonlinear couplings , namely , the streaming terms @xmath39 , are generally given by the poisson brackets ( commutation relations ) among the slow variables in the classical ( quantum ) system @xcite ; @xmath40 , \\label{eq : stream}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41/(i \\hbar )   ; a{\\rangle}.\\ ] ] the important point is that the poisson - bracket relations depend on the microscopic expressions of the variables .",
    "this fact leads to an important consequence that the dynamic universality class of the qcd cp may not be the same as of the liquid - gas cp or the model h. actually , in the model h , the poisson - bracket relations are calculated with the non - relativistic relations @xcite .",
    "we first identify the slow variables near the qcd cp , which consist of soft modes and conserved densities . for the qcd cp , the soft modes are nothing but the long - wavelength fluctuations of the conserved densities , i.e. , the baryon number density @xmath42 and the energy and momentum @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that the slow variables near the qcd cp are given by only the fluctuations of the conserved quantities : @xmath44 because the slow dynamics of the conserved quantities is basically given by hydrodynamics , we find that the system near the qcd cp is described as a relativistic critical fluid . in other words ,",
    "the relevant modes are given as the relativistic - hydrodynamic modes .",
    "this is the basic observation for our construction of the nonlinear langevin equation for the qcd cp .",
    "more specifically , the hydrodynamic modes are the thermal and viscous diffusion modes , and the sound propagating mode .",
    "the thermal mode is the entropy fluctuation inducing the density and energy fluctuations , whereas the viscous and the sound modes are the transverse and longitudinal components of the momentum fluctuations , respectively .",
    "now , we note that not all fluctuations are enhanced near the cp",
    ". therefore , we can neglect nonlinearity of fluctuations that is not enhanced , if such fluctuations are identified .",
    "then , let us identify the non - enhanced fluctuations by the hydrodynamics . the usual hydrodynamics with static scaling laws is useful to see the such tendency of the slow variables .",
    "since the result turns out to be independent of the choice of the frame , which defines the local rest frame @xcite , let us take the energy frame , namely the landau equation @xcite , which is given by the following conservation laws : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the particle current and the energy - momentum tensor , respectively .",
    "those are given as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the enthalpy density with @xmath50 and @xmath51 being the energy density and the pressure .",

    "@xmath60 is the projection onto the space - like vector and @xmath61 is the space - like derivative .    in the hydrodynamic regime , @xmath62 ,",
    "the hydrodynamic modes is analyzed by the linearized equation , which is given by @xmath63 where the symbols with a prefix @xmath64 denote the fluctuations from their equilibrium values , which are denoted by a suffix @xmath65.)- ( [ eq : lj ] ) , from those in @xcite by the thermodynamic relations @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the entropy per particle .",
    "] hereafter , variables with the suffix and the prefix respectively denote the equilibrium values and fluctuations . as relativistic effects",
    ", we see that dissipative effects appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ln ] ) while vanish in eq .",
    "( [ eq : le ] ) , because we have chosen the energy frame .",
    "we note that the relativistic effect for the particle frame appears in a different form @xcite .    by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ln])-([eq : lj ] ) and static scaling laws , the tendency of the hydrodynamic modes is analyzed in the critical regime , @xmath69 .",
    "we have studied the such behavior in the previous paper @xcite and shown that the thermal mode is enhanced , whereas the sound mode is suppressed and the viscous mode is not enhanced nor suppressed .",
    "recalling the relation between the hydrodynamic modes and the slow variables , we have the result that @xmath70 and @xmath71 are enhanced , while @xmath72 is not near the qcd cp .",
    "we note that nonlinear couplings among these modes , which is not included in usual hydrodynamics , become significant in the critical regime .",
    "we will take them into account in the nonlinear langevin equation , except for the fluctuation of the momenta @xmath72 , the nonlinear term of which will be neglected even in the critical regime .",
    "next , we construct the thermodynamic potential @xmath73 for the slow variables .",
    "since the momentum density fluctuation is not enhanced near the qcd cp , we can neglect its coupling with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and may adopt a gaussian form for the momentum density part of the potential .",

    "in fact , @xmath77 is the quantity that determines the static property of the system and the qcd cp belongs to the same static universality class as the 3d ising class , namely , @xmath78 .",

    "we note that @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 need not to be determined for the critical divergence of transport coefficients , since they have no singularities at the cp .",
    "although one could use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mr1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mr2 ] ) for the mapping , it turns out to be inconvenient for the analysis by a langevin equation . to translate these equations to more convenient ones , we assume the following relation @xcite : @xmath98 which is actually derived by considering a change of the microscopic distributions due to small deviations of the external parameters in both systems . from the relations eqs .",

    "the argument assumes the insignificance of the relativity for the critical dynamics by the slowness of the diffusion processes .",
