    "studies of weak gravitational lensing in cosmology are a very powerful tool for attempts to understand the distribution of mass and the evolution of the large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "recently , it has also become possible to constrain values for the cosmological parameters from weak lensing studies . since the gravitational deflections of light arise from variations in the gravitational potential along the light path , the deflections result from the underlying distribution of mass which is usually considered to be in the form of dark matter . the lensing signal therefore contains information about the clustering of mass along the line - of - sight which may be different from the clustering inferred from galaxy surveys which trace the luminous matter only .",
    "in addition , by studying the way light from large numbers of sources at high redshifts is deflected , it is possible to obtain information about the way the clustering of mass evolves with time .    as a result of weak gravitational lensing , a source at high redshift will appear magnified ( or de - magnified ) as the beam converges ( or diverges ) due to matter ( or an under - density ) contained within it .",
    "the image also undergoes shearing due to deflections from matter outside the beam , and causes a circular source , for example , to appear as an elliptical image .",
    "sources at similar redshifts and contained within a small field - of - view will display similar magnification and shear characteristics because their light will have passed along similar density paths .",
    "for this reason there will be strong correlations in the changes to the ellipticities , particularly on small scales , and declining correlations on increasing angular scales .",
    "the magnitude of this correlation depends strongly on the density parameter and the value of the cosmological constant for the universe , as these parameters reflect both the amount of mass and the rate of evolution of structure .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to estimate weak lensing statistics in different cosmological models , both analytically and numerically .",

    "observationally , the ellipticity of an image is frequently defined in terms of the tensor of second brightness moments , @xmath56(\\theta_i - \\bar{\\theta_i})(\\theta_j - \\bar{\\theta_j})}{\\int{\\rm d}\\theta q_i}[i(\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\theta$})],\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the surface brightness of the galaxy image at angular position @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the angular position of the centre of light , and @xmath60 $ ] is a weighting function in terms of the surface brightness .",
    "( see blandford et al .",
    ", 1991 , for example . )",
    "then one definition is the complex ellipticity @xmath61 for elliptical isophotes , this definition is equivalent to @xmath62 where @xmath63 .    the `` reduced shear , '' @xmath64 , evaluated for position @xmath58 in the image , is defined by @xmath65 so that the transformation between the source and image ellipticities may be given by @xmath66 for @xmath67 ( where the asterisk refers to the complex conjugate ) .",
    "then , in the case of weak lensing , for which @xmath68 and , , so that , for low intrinsic source ellipticities , .    however , the intrinsic ellipticities of observed galaxies are generally unknown , so that the determination of the shear signal from individual images is impossible .",
    "for this reason , it is necessary to consider ensembles of galaxy images together , and to assume that the galaxies of each ensemble have random intrinsic ellipticities , so that the ensemble has zero net ellipticity .",
    "whilst this is strictly not true , in high - redshift surveys in which the galaxies within each narrow cone may be widely separated , it serves as a good working approximation .",
    "a number of studies have been made into intrinsic correlations of galaxy shapes ; heavens , refregier & heymans ( 2000 ) , for example , have shown that the intrinsic correlation function for elliptical galaxies at @xmath69 in an lcdm cosmology is only of order @xmath70 on angular scales of @xmath71 to @xmath72 , and is approximately an order of magnitude lower than the correlations expected from weak lensing .",
    "however , the intrinsic correlations are expected to exceed those arising from weak shear in shallow surveys , as found , for example by brown et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , for sources with a median redshift of only 0.1 .",
    "if then the ensemble of sources has zero net ellipticity , @xmath73 and @xmath74 where the @xmath75 are weight factors . consequently then , in the case of weak lensing only , @xmath76 and the variances in both the shear and the reduced shear for a given angular scale are expected to be similar .",
    "the importance of the convergence for understanding the evolution of structure lies in its close association with the density contrast , @xmath77 , at position @xmath78 , which is defined by @xmath79 by extension of the above equations for @xmath26 ( equation  [ psiij ] ) and @xmath68 ( equation  [ kappa1 ] ) , twice the value of the effective convergence in the direction @xmath58 for a source at distance @xmath80 is @xmath81 in which @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the hubble parameter .",
    "consequently , the effective convergence represents a projection of the density contrast , and is proportional to the density parameter , @xmath84 : @xmath85    it is also important to note how the two - point statistical properties of the shear and convergence are related . from the definitions of the individual shear tensors , @xmath86 ( equation  [ u2 ] ) , the components @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the shear ( equations  [ gamma1 ] and  [ gamma2 ] ) , and the effective convergence , @xmath68 ( equation  [ kappa1 ] ) , the following expressions apply in fourier space : @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the components of the wavevector @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 then it is clear that the power spectra for the shear , @xmath95 , and the convergence , @xmath96 , are the same in the case of weak lensing .    to obtain values for the shear ( or convergence ) variances analytically , the convergence power spectrum is integrated over all wavenumbers , using a filter function appropriate for the required angular scale , @xmath97 .",
    "since the convergence is obtained from a projection of the density contrast ( equation  [ projection ] ) from the source redshift to the observer , the shear variance calculation requires a complete spatial and temporal description of the matter power spectrum , @xmath98 .",
    "this is a function of the real - space wavenumber , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the angular diameter distance for a radial distance @xmath101 from the observer .",
    "kaiser ( 1998 ) has determined general expressions for the angular power spectra of weak lensing distortions for different cosmological models , and has estimated the growth of this power with source redshift . as expected ,",
    "the redshift dependence is much stronger in low density cosmologies and especially so in cosmologies dominated by a cosmological constant .",

    "the scale @xmath106 is the angular radius of a circular window , so that the formula has to be transformed to express the shear variance on scales , @xmath97 , represented by square pixels .",
    "a complete description of the power spectrum on all scales ( including the linear , quasi - linear and non - linear regimes ) is necessary for the analytical approach , together with a detailed description of its evolution .",
    "in particular ,",
    "non - linear effects on scales of order @xmath107 may increase the amplitude of the convergence power spectrum by an order of magnitude .",
    "in addition , density fluctuations on scales smaller than about @xmath72 contribute most strongly to the weak lensing signal , precisely where the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum is most in evidence . in the non - linear regime , the fitting formul  of peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) , which extends the earlier work of hamilton et al . , ( 1991 ) for the evolution of the matter correlation function , may be used to map the non - linear wavenumbers onto equivalent linear wavenumbers , and thus to evaluate the shear variance values .",
    "these fitting formul  include the stable - clustering hypothesis which assumes an invariant mean particle separation on sufficiently small scales .",
    "analytical programs based on this prescription are accurate to @xmath108 , depending on the cosmological model .",
    "for ( circular ) angular scales of @xmath109 and @xmath110 , jain & seljak ( 1997 ) summarised their findings in approximate power - law expressions , which are equivalent to @xmath111 \\propto \\vartheta^{-0.84}z_s^{1.52}\\sigma_8^{2.58(2.00)}\\omega_m^{1.20(1.36 ) } \\label{jain4}\\ ] ] for lcdm cosmologies .",
    "the different indices for @xmath112 and @xmath84 on the different scales enable the degeneracy between these parameters to be lifted when measurements are made in both regimes .",
    "the power of @xmath10 quoted is an intermediate value for the two angular scales .    on the scales @xmath113 , the angular scale dependency was similar , and the powers of @xmath10 were close ; the index of @xmath10 decreased from 1.54 at @xmath109 to 1.48 at @xmath114 .",
    "as a result , jain & seljak ( 1997 ) found that , for lcdm cosmologies , @xmath115 approximately .",
    "( @xmath106 and @xmath97 are interchangeable in this context . )    the numerically determined shear variance results quoted in this paper , and derived from the real - space values of the shear computed numerically , will be compared with this approximate expression .",
    "in addition , as a check of the validity of the numerical results , analytical values for the shear variance have also been computed directly for the precise cosmology used in the numerical simulations . to achieve this the analytical program described in van waerbeke et al .",

    ", the code uses the peculiar gravitational potential , @xmath17 , through the subtraction of a term depending upon the mean density .",
    "this ensures that only light ray deflections arising from departures from homogeneity apply , and is equivalent to requiring that the net total mass in the system be set to zero .",
    "the algorithm automatically includes the contributions of the periodic images of the fundamental volume in computing the three - dimensional shear at any location , thereby essentially creating a realisation extending to infinity .    since the algorithm works within three - dimensional simulation volumes , rather than on planar projections of the particle distributions , angular diameter distances to every evaluation position can be applied . in this work",

    "a set of light paths was constructed emanating from the centre of the front face of the @xmath13 box and ending in a regular square array of locations at the plane of the chosen source redshift .",
    "a total of 14 source redshifts were selected to give good statistical coverage of the redshifts of interest .",

    "they corresponded to the simulation box redshifts and were chosen to be close to redshifts of 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 3.0 and 3.5 . in this paper the source redshifts",
    "will be referred to loosely as the latter approximate values , although in the determination of redshift dependences , etc . , the actual redshift values were used .    using a total of @xmath130 lines of sight ,",
    "the angular size of the minimum particle softening is comparable to or less than the angular separation of the adjacent lines of sight ( @xmath131 ) for all redshifts greater than 0.14 .",
    "consequently , to account for the larger angular size of the minimum softening at low redshifts , and also for the allowed range of particle softening scales above the minimum value , a resolution limit of @xmath12 has been adopted for the data analyses .",
    "in addition , the angular size of the gravitational force softening used in the generation of the simulation boxes is below the line - of - sight separation for all redshifts greater than 0.05 . for a source at redshift 1 in the lcdm cosmology ,",
    "maximal gravitational lensing occurs for a lens at redshift 0.36 , and the angular separation of adjacent lines of sight is approximately the same value as the angular size of the minimum particle softening at that redshift ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "the total field - of - view for the set of lines of sight was @xmath133 , and this completely fills the near face of the simulation box at redshift 1.0 .    to establish the locations for the evaluation of the shear on each of the lines of sight , first a regularly spaced ( coarse ) set of 50 locations",
    "was laid down on each line in each simulation box . then additional locations were computed at positions where the gravitational potential was changing most rapidly , so that the potential field could be well - sampled . to establish these locations ,",
    "the particles were assigned to volumes determined by a @xmath134 grid within each box . from each of the coarse line of sight locations , the separations to the particles within the local grid volume and the nearest neighbouring grid volumes was determined . if a separation was less than the line - of - sight separation , a new evaluation location was established on the line - of - sight , with coordinates corresponding to the particle s position in the @xmath27 direction ( radially from the observer ) .",
    "all the evaluation locations ( coarse and new ) along each line in each box were then sorted , labelled and counted so that the programme to integrate the values along the lines of sight would operate in the correct order for the correct number of locations .    following the shear computations at all of the locations on all the lines of sight in all the simulation volumes",
    ", the second derivatives of the two - dimensional effective lensing potentials were obtained from the three - dimensional shear values by integration , in accordance with equation  [ psiij ] .",
    "the integration was made in step - sizes determined by the separation of adjacent evaluation locations on each of the lines of sight , and so was different for every pair of points .",
    "the integration algorithm was set to run from each of the chosen source redshift planes , along each of the lines of sight to @xmath135 , and values for the elements of the shear matrix , and thus the jacobian matrix , at the observer were obtained for each of the lines of sight . from these data , all the required weak lensing statistics were obtained for each line of sight and for each source redshift .    the full procedure , from the computation of the three - dimensional shear values at all the evaluation locations to finally obtaining the jacobian matrices at @xmath13 , involved precisely the same approximations as described fully in barber et al .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that , because the lines of sight project radially from the observer at @xmath13 , some lines of sight pass outside the confines of the simulation volume beyond a redshift of 1 . in these cases , the periodicity of the boxes has been used to reposition the lines of sight at equivalent locations within the volumes .",
    "the area of the far face of the most distant simulation box ( at redshift 3.6 ) is @xmath136 .",

    "the computed values from each of the @xmath0 runs were then averaged , and the errors on the means of @xmath138 determined .    figure  [ v3 ] shows the shear variances computed in this way ( without the error bars for clarity ) for all the source redshifts , with the exception of @xmath1 , which is too low to be seen clearly .",
    "the figure clearly emphasises the redshift dependence of the results and suggests that a good knowledge of the redshift distribution of the sources observed in surveys is essential to interpreting the shear signal correctly .",
    "the relative closeness of adjacent curves separated by intervals of only 0.1 in redshift also suggests that the shear signal from sources with a _ small _ spread in redshift _ may _ be adequately described by the shear signal expected from sources at their median redshift .",

    "the numerical values computed here for source redshifts of 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , 1.0 and 1.5 are now plotted in figure  [ varludojs_b ] , together with the analytical values determined using van waerbeke et al.s ( 2001a ) code , described above ; also shown are jain & seljak s ( 1997 ) predicted values ( transformed to square pixel areas ) for source redshifts of 1 , using their approximate expression for general lcdm cosmologies .",
    "the advantage of van waerbeke et al s ( 2001a ) prescription is that the precise cosmological parameters and source redshifts used in the numerical work have been used .",

    "the largest discrepancies occur only for sources at high redshift ( beyond about 1.5 ) and at angular scales comparable with and below the resolution limit of the numerical data , and where breakdown of both the numerical and analytical procedures may also be expected .",
    "the values from jain & seljak s ( 1997 ) approximate general expression differ somewhat from both the numerical and analytical results reported here for source redshifts other than 1 , so that it appears qualitatively that the results here would show a different redshift dependence than the former analytical predictions .    @xmath141    the redshift dependence of the shear variance on the chosen angular scales is now plotted in figure  [ v4a ] .",
    "@xmath142    since the redshift relationship for the shear variance and its scale dependence are of fundamental importance to observational measurements of the cosmic shear signal , the numerical results from figures  [ v3 ] ,  [ varludojs_b ] and  [ v4a ] have been fitted mathematically .",

    "the slopes of the curves have a very small @xmath97 dependence , and , for redshifts greater than about 1 , the curves become clearly less steep , indicating that the redshift dependence falls well below 2 at high source redshifts .    @xmath150    in section 2 , it was shown that , in the case of weak lensing , both the shear , @xmath45 , and the reduced shear , @xmath64 , will be approximately equal , so that the variances in both these quantities will also be similar . indeed , this approximation is used observationally to estimate the values of the shear from the observed ellipticities",
    ". however , the equality holds only in the weak lensing limit . the numerical method used here for computing the weak lensing statistics enables a direct comparison to be made between the variances in @xmath45 and @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ v2 ] compares @xmath151 with @xmath152 for redshifts of 0.5 , 1 and 2 . for low source redshifts ,",
    "the curves are almost identical ( except for the smallest of angular scales ) .",
    "this is as expected , because this is the regime of the weak lensing limit .",
    "however , departures between the two quantities become increasingly obvious as the source redshift is increased .    @xmath153    the redshift dependence for @xmath154 on the different angular scales is plotted in figure  [ vea ] .",
    "@xmath155    the functional form of @xmath156 can be written in a similar way to that for @xmath157 . by analogy with equation  [ gammathetaz ] , the variance in the reduced shear can be written as @xmath158 in the range @xmath144 , for @xmath159 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath160 can be expressed as @xmath161 as for @xmath147 in the expression for the shear variance , @xmath162 here falls very slightly as @xmath97 increases at small angular scales , but then remains almost constant throughout the range of angular scales .",
    "explicitly , for @xmath159 , @xmath162 can be expressed as the constant value @xmath163    the variance in the reduced shear for the entire redshift range is plotted with logarithmic axes in figure  [ vealog ] to indicate both the @xmath97 and @xmath10 dependencies of the results .",
    "@xmath164    as found for the shear variance , figure  [ vealog ] for the reduced shear , shows how the slopes of the curves at the low redshift end have a slight @xmath97 dependence .",
    "however , unlike the shear , at high redshifts the slopes become more noisy and generally steeper , even though the slopes do decline very gently throughout the redshift range up to about 2 .",
    "this is most likely a result of the sensitivity to the convergence , apparent from equation  [ g ] , which becomes important either on small angular scales or at high redshifts , where the lensing effects are strongest .",
    "the main results established in this paper are the dependences of the shear variance and the variance in the reduced shear on source redshift and angular scale .",
    "the numerical data obtained has been validated by analytical computations using van waerbeke et al.s ( 2001a ) program applied to an identical cosmology and the same source redshifts .    for the shear variance , for source redshifts up to 1.6 ,",
    "one can write , without the error bars for clarity , @xmath165 for @xmath159 .",
    "i.e. , the redshift dependence is close to @xmath8 , and stronger than the previous analytical predictions of jain & seljak ( 1997 ) who found a dependence close to @xmath166 .",
    "whilst the above equation fits the numerical data well within the range specified , the redshift dependence clearly begins to decline for sources beyond a redshift of 1 , so that the index of @xmath10 falls substantially below 2 at high redshift .",
    "for the variance in the reduced shear , again it has been found that the redshift dependence is close to @xmath8 , and for @xmath144 it can be described by @xmath167 for @xmath159 , again without the error bars for clarity . at higher redshifts , although there is an underlying tendency for the curves to become less steep , the reduced shear is noisy and sensitive to values of the convergence , so that the curves steepen again at the high redshift end .",
    "it was mentioned in the results section that kaiser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and bartelmann & schneider ( 2001 ) have plotted recent observational determinations of the shear variances on a single diagram and compared the results with the predicted analytical values of jain & seljak ( 1997 ) .",
    "these plots show the observational results to lie close to the predicted curve for sources at a redshift of 1 .",
    "it should be noted at this point that the values determined numerically here , and also analytically using van waerbeke et al.s ( 2001a ) program , concur well with the analytical values plotted _ for source redshifts of 1_. however ,",
    "the observational results plotted have galaxies with distributions in redshift ; for example , bacon et al .",
    "( 2000 ) quote a median redshift of @xmath168 for their sample , van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 2000a ) refer to a peak redshift of 0.9 for their galaxies , kaiser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) has an `` effective '' redshift of 1.0 , and the survey of maoli et al .",
    "( 2001 ) has a broad redshift distribution which peaks at a redshift of 0.8 .    whilst jain et al .",
    "( 2000 ) claim that a distribution of sources with a mean redshift of 1 gives rise to an amplitude for the shear variance only 10% different from the case where all the galaxies are assumed to lie at @xmath140 , the contention here is that it is necessary to have a clear understanding of how the shear signal relates to the redshift of the sources , and how a distribution of source redshifts may further influence the conclusions . as an example , there are differences of @xmath169  20% between the shear variance values for sources separated by a redshift interval of only 0.1 on angular scales of @xmath12 .",
    "attempts to constrain the cosmology precisely will founder if the redshift dependence reported here is not taken into account . according to equation  [ jain4 ]",
    "an uncertainty of about 0.025 in the density parameter also results if there is a 10% uncertainty in the shear variance .",
    "in addition , there are clear differences between the variances in the shear and the more directly measured reduced shear , particularly at high redshift and on small angular scales where the weak - lensing regime may not be applicable .",
    "these factors point clearly to the need for studies into the strength of the cosmic shear signal for sources distributed in redshift , and will be investigated in a future paper .",
    "the faster redshift dependence reported here ( @xmath170 compared with @xmath171 previously predicted ) is not easily explained , as there are assumptions in both approaches . in the numerical method",
    "one could point to the discontinuities in structure as one passes from box to box , although the effect of this is reduced statistically by employing a large number of runs ( 20 in this work ) .",
    "the particle softening and resolution limitations might also be a factor in the simulations . in the analytical approach ,",
    "the main difficulty arises in trying to describe accurately the evolution of the power spectrum in the non - linear regime . here",
    "mapping techniques using fitting formul , accurate to @xmath172 , are used to relate the linear and non - linear spectra , and assumptions such as the stable - clustering hypothesis are used . also , jain & seljak s ( 1997 ) published predictions are the result of summarising data from different cosmological models , and then fitting the data to approximate formul  to express the power - law dependencies of the statistics .",
    "improvements have been made more recently however in analytical procedures , for example , seljak ( 2000 ) and peacock & smith ( 2000 ) have developed a model for the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum based on the random distribution of dark matter haloes , modulated by the large - scale matter distribution .",
    "the main advantage of the numerical method is that the shear values and variances are determined directly from the real - space data , rather than from integration of a power spectrum which is less well understood on the scales of interest .",
    "it is also expected that numerical results may be used in the future to test the validity of developments in analytical procedures , which will be increasingly needed in view of the expected accuracies in the next generation of cosmic shear measurements . for",
    "the interpretation of these observations , fast analytical procedures will be more practical , since it will be unrealistic to generate large numbers of numerical simulations to cover a realistic parameter space .",
    "a key influence on the redshift dependence of the shear variance lies in the functional form of @xmath173 , the angular diameter distance function .",
    "@xmath173 occurs in equation  [ jvar ] where it multiplies the matter power spectrum to produce the effective convergence power spectrum . in the numerical method here",
    "it also plays a crucial role in establishing the elements of the final jacobian matrices , from which the convergence and shear values are obtained . in the numerical work here , the `` filled beam '' values for @xmath173",
    "have been used as it is assumed that the light is always passing through a region of smoothed density .",
    "( see barber et al .",
    ", 2000 , for a full discussion of angular diameter distances in inhomogeneous universes . )",
    "the form of @xmath173 at high redshifts may also help to explain the reducing index of @xmath10 , because the redshift value at the peak of the @xmath173 curve rises less quickly as the source redshift is increased .    in this paper ,",
    "no attempt has been made to simulate the signal which might arise from typical noisy data .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticities of the background galaxies is a source of random noise , and in addition , measurement errors of very faint galaxies introduce errors in the ellipticity estimates .",
    "the intrinsic ellipticity correlations of galaxies in close proximity to each other produce a real signal which has to be disentangled from the cosmic shear correlations from the large - scale structure along the line - of - sight .",
    "heavens et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have attempted to determine the intrinsic correlations by modelling the shapes and angular momentum vectors of galaxies in a way which reflects the shape and angular momenta of their dark matter halos in @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "they find that the intrinsic ellipticity correlation function for elliptical galaxies is an order of magnitude below the expected weak lensing signal on scales of @xmath71 to @xmath72 for sources at @xmath174 in a lcdm cosmology .",
    "brown et al . ( 2000 ) have analysed real data from the supercosmos sky survey for galaxies with a low median redshift of @xmath175 .",
    "they find that the ellipticity variance is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than the expected weak lensing signal throughout the range @xmath107 to @xmath176 . as the source redshifts are low , they claim that their result represents the real intrinsic correlations since the weak lensing signal would be expected to be small .    taking the above two reports into account",
    ", there will be some intermediate redshift at which the weak lensing signal overtakes the intrinsic one .",
    "consequently , whilst the result reported here presents the pure redshift dependency of the weak lensing signal , it is clearly advantageous to study good data at high redshift in order to measure the uncontaminated cosmic signal .",
    "this represents a further argument in favour of having good redshift information in a galaxy survey designed to measure cosmic shear .",
    "it is anticipated that forthcoming deep weak lensing surveys , such as that proposed for the vista telescope , will also provide detailed photometric redshift information to enable the surveyed galaxies to be binned in redshift intervals . in this way it is anticipated that the real cosmic shear signal may be interpreted more correctly .",
    "this work has been supported by pparc and carried out with facilities provided by the university of sussex .",
    "the original code for the three - dimensional shear computations was written by hugh couchman of mcmaster university .",
