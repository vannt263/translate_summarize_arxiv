    "the ability to control nonlinear dynamical systems has brought up a wide interdisciplinary area of research that has evolved rapidly in the last decades @xcite . in particular , noninvasive control schemes based on time - delayed feedback @xcite have been studied and applied to various systems ranging from biological and chemical applications to physics and engineering in both theoretical and experimental works @xcite . here we propose to use adaptive control schemes based on optimizations of cost or goal functions @xcite to find appropriate control parameters . besides isolated systems , control of dynamics in spatio - temporal systems and on networks has recently gained much interest @xcite .",

    "this stuart - landau system arises naturally as a generic expansion near a hopf bifurcation and is therefore often used as a paradigm for oscillators .",
    "the complex coupling constant that arises from the complex state variables in networks of stuart - landau oscillators consists of an amplitude and a phase .",
    "similar coupling phases arise naturally in systems with all - optical coupling @xcite .",
    "such phase - dependent couplings have also been shown to be important in overcoming the odd - number limitation of time - delay feedback control @xcite and in anticipating chaos synchronization @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that the value of the coupling phase is a crucial control parameter in these systems , and by adjusting this phase one can deliberately switch between different synchronous oscillatory states of the network . in order to find an appropriate value of the coupling phase one",
    "could solve a nonlinear equation that involves the system parameters .",
    "however , in practice the exact values of the system parameters are unknown , and analytical conditions can be derived only for special values of the complex phase .",
    "an efficient way to avoid these limitations and find optimal values of the coupling phase is the use of adaptive control .    in this paper",
    ", we present an adaptive synchronization algorithm for delay - coupled networks of stuart - landau oscillators .",
    "to find an adequate coupling phase we apply the speed - gradient method @xcite , which was used previously in various nonlinear control problems , yet not for the control of dynamics in delay - coupled networks . by taking an appropriate goal function",
    "we derive an equation for the automatic adjustment of the coupling phase such that the goal function is minimized . at the same time the coupling phase converges to the theoretically predicted value .",
    "our goal function is based on the kuramoto order parameter and is able to distinguish the different states of synchrony in the stuart - landau networks irrespectively of the numbering of the nodes .",

    "the stability of synchronized oscillations in networks can be determined numerically , for instance , by the _ master stability function _",
    "this formalism allows a separation of the local dynamics of the individual nodes from the network topology . in the case of the stuart - landau oscillators it was possible to obtain the floquet exponents of different cluster states analytically with this technique @xcite . by these means",
    "it has been demonstrated that the unidirectional ring configuration of stuart - landau oscillators exhibits in - phase synchrony , splay states , and clustering depending on the choice of the control parameter @xmath10 . for @xmath21 , there exists multistability of the possible synchronous states in a large parameter range .",
    "however , when tuning the coupling phase to an optimal value @xmath22 according to a particular state @xmath15 , this synchronous state is monostable for any values of the coupling strength @xmath9 and the time delay @xmath8 .",

    "the algorithm ( [ sgalgorithm ] ) is called _ speed - gradient _ ( sg ) _ algorithm _ , since it suggests to change @xmath34 proportionally to the gradient of the speed of changing @xmath37 .",
    "the idea of this algorithm is the following .",
    "the term @xmath38 points to the direction in which the value of @xmath39 decreases with the highest speed .",
    "therefore , if one forces the control signal to `` follow '' this direction , the value of @xmath39 will decrease and finally be negative . when @xmath40 , then @xmath37 will decrease and , eventually , tend to zero .",
    "we shall now apply the speed - gradient method to networks of stuart - landau oscillators .",

    "we have proposed a novel adaptive method for the control of synchrony on oscillator networks , which combines time - delayed coupling with the speed gradient method of control theory .",
    "choosing an appropriate goal function , a desired state of generalized synchrony can be selected by the self - adaptive automatic adjustment of a control parameter , i.e. , the coupling phase .",
    "this goal function , which is based on a generalization of the kuramoto order parameter , vanishes for the desired state , e.g. , in - phase , splay , or cluster states , irrespectively of the ordering of the nodes . by numerical simulations",
    "we have shown that those different states can be stabilized , and the coupling phase converges to an optimum value .",
    "we have elaborated on the robustness of the control scheme by investigating the success rates of the algorithm in dependence on the coupling parameters , i.e. , the coupling strength and the time delay . in this work",
    ", we focused on the adaptive adjustment of the coupling phase while the other coupling parameters were fixed .",
    "the input variable @xmath34 in eq .",
    "may in general contain all of the coupling parameters .",
    "thus , as a generalization , our method might be applied to all coupling parameters including the coupling amplitude and the time delay . in this way control of cluster and splay synchronization",
    "might be possible without any a priori knowledge of the coupling parameters . given the paradigmatic nature of the stuart - landau oscillator as a generic model , we expect broad applicability , for instance to synchronization of networks in medicine , chemistry or mechanical engineering .",
