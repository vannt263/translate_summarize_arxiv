    "ring systems exist around all of the giant planets in our solar system .",
    "the rings of the saturnian system are the most prominent and consist mainly of centimeter to meter sized icy bodies @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , jupiter s rings are far more tenuous and consist of micron - size dust particles @xcite",
    ". since rings are ubiquitous around giant planets in the solar system , they may also be common around extrasolar planets .",
    "although more than 500 extrasolar planets have been discovered to date , no extrasolar satellites or ring systems have been detected yet .",
    "however , this may change soon due to the unprecedented photometric accuracy of the kepler satellite @xcite and due to the constantly improving precision and increasing temporal baseline of ground based radial velocity surveys . since rings typically reside in the planet s equatorial plane",
    ", the required photometric and spectroscopic precision for ring detection depends of the planet s obliquity .",
    "the obliquity , @xmath5 , refers here to the angle between an extrasolar planet s spin axis and the normal of its orbital plane .",
    "@xcite estimate that saturn - like rings could be detected around transiting extrasolar planets with a photometric precision of @xmath6 and a 15 minutes time resolution as long as the ring is not viewed close to edge - on ( i.e. , as long as @xmath5 is not @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is within the photometric accuracy that the kepler spacecraft achieves for sun - like and brighter stars ( http://keplergo.arc.nasa.gov/calibrationsn.shtml ) . in addition , rings around transiting extrasolar planets could also be identified spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that rings with significant obliquities are detectable with currently achievable radial velocity precision of 1 m / s , whereas rings with @xmath8 would typically require a radial velocity precision of 0.1 m / s or less , which is still beyond the reach of radial velocity surveys .",
    "a potential obstacle to detecting extrasolar rings may be that most close in exoplanets could have low obliquities , which would make their rings hard , if not impossible , to discover .",
    "the initial obliquities of close in extrasolar planets with masses comparable to and bigger than neptune are likely to be large , since such planets are thought to have formed at larger semi - major axes and have reached their current location by planet - planet scattering , disk migration , or by kozai oscillations with a stellar companion or a combination of such processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "tides raised on the exoplanet by its host star will , however , lead to damping of its obliquity . to first order in @xmath5 ,",
    "the obliquity damping timescale for exoplanets with small eccentricities is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the exoplanet s tidal love number , @xmath11 its tidal dissipation function , @xmath12 is the stellar mass and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the semi - major axis , radius and mass of the extrasolar planet , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the exoplanet s moment of inertia and @xmath18 is its orbital frequency . for our estimates",
    "( i.e. , @xmath19 ) .",
    "the actual moment of inertia of a planet should be somewhat smaller than this because it will be centrally concentrated , i.e. its density will increase towards its center .",
    "] since the synchronization timescale is comparable to the obliquity damping timescale , we assumed in equation ( 1 ) that the exoplanet s spin period is comparable to its orbital period .",
    "evaluating equation ( [ e0 ] ) for a jupiter like exoplanet around a sun - like star and assuming @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 we find that @xmath22 and @xmath23 for semi - major axes greater than about 0.1  au and 0.2  au , respectively .",
    "we therefore expect most exoplanets with semi - major axes greater than a few tenths of an au to have significant obliquities , allowing for ring detections .",
    "although only a handful of transiting exoplanets are currently known with @xmath24  au , the kepler satellite is likely to fill in this parameter space in the near future .",
    "furthermore , even for systems with @xmath25  au , stellar tides do not need to damp exoplanets obliquities to zero , because for sufficiently high initial obliquities , the planets may settle into a high obliquity cassini state @xcite . in short ,",
    "we expect most exoplanets with semi - major axes greater than a few tenths of an au to have significant obliquities , allowing for ring detections , and note that systems with smaller semi - major axes could reside in high obliquity cassini states rather than having their obliquities damped to zero .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate what types of ring systems could exist around extrasolar planets with semi - major axes of about 1au or less .",
    "we focus on these systems , which we coin  warm saturns  , since they fall within the kepler discovery space , which is limited to extrasolar planets with orbital periods of about 1 year and less .",
    "we show that such extrasolar ring systems , if they exist , will differ from those in our solar system and examine the different dynamical forces that play a role in shaping them .",
    "we show that the presence of extrasolar rings , or the lack thereof , provides interesting implications for ring formation theories and that the detection of extrasolar rings will constrain the extrasolar planet s obliquity and in some cases also its quadrupole moment .",
    "measuring an exoplanet s quadrupole moment would be especially exciting since it would allow us to probe its interior structure @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we start by determining the roche radius and ring composition in section 2.1 and examine the effect of poynting - robertson drag on the ring particles in section 2.2 . in section 2.3 and 2.4 , we discuss the implications of the planet s proximity to its host star on ring formation and ring orientation , respectively .",
    "discussion and conclusions follow in section 3 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the general properties of planetary rings from ring studies in the solar system .",
    "we then extend these results to extrasolar planets and discuss their implications .",
    "the existence and radial extent of planetary rings is determined by the tidal field of the planet . to make this discussion more concrete , we focus on the saturnian system . within the planet s roche radius ,",
    "a satellite can not attain hydrostatic equilibrium , which typically leads to mass loss and the disruption of the satellite and the subsequent formation of rings @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a large , self - gravitating and synchronously rotating satellite with a density @xmath26 the roche radius , @xmath27 , is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the average density of the planet @xcite . for icy particles that make up the saturnian system ,",
    "the average density is @xmath30 , while the density of saturn is @xmath31 .",
    "hence , from equation ( [ eq : roche ] ) , we have that saturn s ring system should extend out to approximately twice saturn s planetary radius , which is consistent with the observed rings around saturn .    the icy particles that make up saturn s rings can exist at saturn s orbital radius because the local temperature is sufficiently low .",
    "however , for the known extrasolar planets , the presence of ices is doubtful as most of the them reside close to their parent star . in figure",
    "[ f : temperature semi ] , we plot the equilibrium blackbody temperature for ring particles of known transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "all of these planets have blackbody effective temperatures well in excess of the melting temperature of water ice .",
    "there is a considerable range in melting and sublimation temperatures for different compositions of rock . for comparison",
    "we plot the melting temperature of silicon dioxide ( @xmath32 ) , which is a high - melting point solid . comparing the equilibrium blackbody temperatures for the currently known transiting exoplanet with the melting temperature of @xmath32",
    "suggests that up to about 35 extrasolar planets could harbor rings made of rocky material . the blackbody equilibrium temperature shown in figure [ f : temperature semi ]",
    "was calculated from the exoplanet s semi - major axis .",
    "ring particles around eccentric exoplanets may therefore reach maximum temperatures that exceed the temperatures plotted in figure [ f : temperature semi ] .",
    "the density of rock varies between 2 and 5 @xmath33 depending on composition , i.e. , iron / nickel content , and porosity .",
    "the higher density of rock compared to ice implies that the resulting ring systems would be more compact compared to icy ring systems ( see equation ( [ eq : roche ] ) ) .",
    "still a substantial number of extrasolar planets could potentially support rings .",
    "we show this in figure [ f : ring radii ] where we plot the roche radius of currently known transiting extrasolar planets for ring particle densities of 3 ( blue circles ) and @xmath34 ( red squares ) .",
    "we also plot @xmath35 for saturn with a mean density of @xmath36 and water ice ring particles with @xmath37 .",
    "it is clear from this plot that a number of extrasolar planets can support rings made of rocky material . indeed",
    "86(76 ) of the 88 planets with reliable radius measurements can support rocky rings with a material density of @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 . of these planets ,",
    "21(12 ) or @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) can support sizable rings , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "having calculated the equilibrium temperatures and the sizes of the roche radii of extrasolar planets , we now turn to examining the ring lifetimes due to poynting - robertson drag . in the solar system",
    ", poynting - robertson drag is not important for saturn s rings , but it does drive the evolution of particles in jupiter s rings @xcite . because of the larger stellar insolation of warm saturns , poynting - robertson drag is significant even for large ring particles as we show below .    the orbital decay time , @xmath43 , of a circumplanetary ring particle with radius , @xmath44 ,",
    "due to poynting - robertson drag is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the speed of light , @xmath47 the stellar luminosity , @xmath48 the inclination of the ring plane with respect to the orbital plane of the extrasolar planet and @xmath49 is the radiation pressure efficency factor @xcite .",
    "if the orbital evolution of each ring particle can be considered independently and if mutual shadowing of ring particles can be neglected , then equation ( [ e:2 ] ) yields the ring particle lifetime due to poynting - robertson drag .",
    "figure [ f : prsize ] shows the smallest ring particles that can survive over @xmath0 years in known transiting extrasolar planet systems due to poynting - robertson drag provided that each ring particle evolves independently . from equation ( [ e:2 ] ) we see that @xmath50 is considerably shorter for small ring particles , suggesting a considerable amount of ring spreading due to poynting - robertson drag .",
    "it is , however , likely that the evolution of individual ring particles are coupled to each other by frequent collisions , in which case the size dependence of @xmath50 is averaged out .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the ring is optically thick , then the poynting - robertson drag timescale depends on the ring mass surface density instead of the sizes of individual ring particles ( see equation ( [ e:3 ] ) ) . for an optically thick ring the maximum surface area that is exposed to stellar irradiation is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the outer and inner ring radii , respectively .",
    "averaging over the orbit of the planet around the star holding the ring orientation fixed , we find that the average surface area exposed to the host star is @xmath54 .",
    "this yields an orbital decay time due to poynting - robertson drag given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mass surface density of the ring .",
    "figure [ f : prtime ] shows the ring lifetimes for known extrasolar planets for ring mass surface densities comparable to saturn s b - ring ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) @xcite .",
    "since @xmath43 scales as @xmath56 , we note here , that the ring lifetimes could be significantly longer for ring systems with ring mass surface densities larger than that of saturn .",
    "furthermore , the ring lifetimes in figure [ f : prtime ] were calculated for an inclinations of @xmath58 , rings with smaller inclinations than this reference value would have longer lifetimes , since a smaller effective ring surface area would be exposed to the stellar radiation from the host star .",
    "figure [ f : prsize ] suggests that ring particles , if they evolve individually , need to be about a meter and larger for the existence of long - lived rings ( i.e. @xmath59  years ) around the currently known transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "if however the ring is optically thick , then the poynting - robertson drag timescale depends only on the mass surface density of the ring and significantly smaller ring particles can survive over long periods .",
    "we note here that the actual ring lifetimes could be shortened due to ring spreading caused by collisions between ring particles , differential precession and/or poynting - robertson drag @xcite .",
    "extrasolar planets with masses comparable to neptune and larger on short period orbits probably did not form in situ but reached their current location by either planet - planet scattering , migration or by kozai oscillations with a stellar companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if such planets originally had icy rings , then these rings will have been sublimated by the time they arrived at their current semi - major axes .",
    "this suggests that , if extrasolar rings are discovered around such planets , that they probably formed close to their current semi - major axes , which may have interesting implications for ring formation .",
    "the hill radius , @xmath60 , denotes the distance from a planet at which the tidal forces from its host star and the gravitational forces from the planet both acting on a test particle , are in equilibrium .",
    "it is given by @xmath61 in our solar systems planetary rings typically reside well inside the hill sphere of their respective hosts .",
    "this is because in our solar system @xmath62 .",
    "for some extrasolar planets however , @xmath63 , due to the proximity to their host stars . since the outer regions of the hill sphere are unstable ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no planetary rings can exist there .",
    "the permitted range within which bound stable orbits , and therefore rings , can exist depends on the inclination of the ring particle s orbit .",
    "retrograde orbits are in general more stable than prograde orbits . for example , coplanar prograde orbits are stable within about @xmath64 whereas coplanar retrograde orbits are stable within about @xmath65 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the unstable outer parts of the hill sphere could have interesting implications for ring formation scenarios .",
    "if rings are formed by a larger body that sheds mass as it comes within the roche radius of a given extrasolar planet , then extrasolar planets with @xmath63 are at a disadvantage , since , due to the lack of bound , stable orbits in the outer parts of the hill sphere , mass shed in this region will be lost from the system and will therefore not be available for ring formation .",
    "therefore for prograde rings , an extrasolar planet with @xmath66 may be a better candidate for hosting rings than one with @xmath67 ( see figure [ f : rhrr ] ) .",
    "the ring orientation for some of these warm saturns may not be trivial , since it is determined by the competing forces of the planet s bulge and the stellar tide . because the ratio of these forces varies as a function of the ring s distance from the planet , @xmath68",
    ", the ring s orientation follows the planet s equator at small @xmath68 and follows the orbital plane at large @xmath68 .",
    "the combined effects of the planet s oblateness and the stellar tide in determining the ring orientation was first recognized by @xcite .",
    "here we use the more recent discussion of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ttn ) . because the strength of planetary oblateness and the stellar tide scale differently with the planet ring separation , the ring orientation varies as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "the plane that this defines is known as the laplace plane . to estimate the magnitude of this effect",
    ", we first note that the strength of the quadrupole potential arising from the planet s bulge is ( ttn ) @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the polar angle from the rotation axis of the planet , @xmath3 is the quadrupole gravitational harmonic , and @xmath71 is a legendre polynomial .",
    "the quadrupole potential arising from the star is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the extrasolar planet s eccentricity . equating equations ( [ eq : planet quadrupole ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : stellar quadrupole ] ) and ignoring the @xmath71 terms , and @xmath5 are @xmath74 so that @xmath75 we estimate what is known as the laplace radius , @xmath76 : @xmath77 this simple order of magnitude estimate agrees with the exact calculation of ttn .",
    "numerically this gives @xmath78 where @xmath79 km is the radius of jupiter . to determine if the rings will lie in the equatorial plane of the planet or in the planet s orbital plane around the host star , we take the ratio of @xmath76 and @xmath35 @xmath80 in figure [ f : al ] , we plot this ratio for three different values of @xmath3 , ranging from of @xmath81 to @xmath82 . for reference",
    ", we note that the giant planets in the solar system have @xmath3 s that vary from @xmath83 for uranus and neptune to @xmath84 for jupiter and saturn .",
    "@xmath85 is denoted by the solid line in figure [ f : al ] . above this line",
    ", @xmath86 and the rings will mostly lie in the plane defined by the planet s equator .",
    "below this line , @xmath87 and the rings will undergo a transition from lying in the planet s equatorial plane at small @xmath68 to lying in the orbital plane at large @xmath68 . from figure",
    "[ f : al ] , it is clear that the fraction of planets with nontrivial laplacian planes varies with @xmath3 . for @xmath88 ,",
    "most ringed extrasolar planets fall below this line and thus have warped rings such that their rings will lie in the planet s equatorial plane inside of @xmath76 , but coincide with the orbital plane outside of @xmath76 . on the other hand , for @xmath89 , most planets have rings that lie in the plane defined by the exoplanet s equator , much like the planetary rings in the solar system .",
    "the observational signature of warped rings is especially interesting as it provides a means by which the planet s @xmath3 can be measured directly .",
    "present constraints on @xmath3 are inferred from transit measurements of the planet s oblateness @xcite .",
    "the inferred @xmath3 from such oblateness measurements is however model dependent .",
    "since warped rings provide a direct constraint on the planet s @xmath3 , which in turn relates to the three moments of inertia about the principle axes , the planet s internal structure can be probed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , measurements of an exoplanet s @xmath3 and of its oblateness would together constrain its spin period .",
    "this method was successfully applied in the past to determine the rotation period of uranus @xcite .",
    "we examined the nature of rings that could exist around extrasolar planets that have orbital periods of about one year or less .",
    "such systems are ideal targets for the kepler satellite , whose photometric precision will be able to identify saturn - like rings around extrasolar planets that are transiting sun - like stars @xcite ( http : keplergo.arc.nasa.gov / calibrationsn.shtml ) .",
    "we have shown that most currently known transiting extrasolar planets are too close to their parent star to support icy rings but that a significant fraction of them could harbor ring particles made of rock or silicates .",
    "we calculated the roche radius for currently known transiting extrasolar planets and compared it with that of saturn . most currently known transiting extrasolar planets have roche radii large enough to support rings and 12 to 21 of them , have roche radii that are comparable to or larger than saturn s roche radius , suggesting that such extrasolar planets could harbor sizable rings .",
    "in addition , we examined the ring lifetime due to poynting - robertson drag . for optically thick rings and a ring mass surface density similar to that of saturn s b - ring , we find ring lifetimes typically range from a few times @xmath1 to a few times @xmath2 years .",
    "we note here that the actual ring lifetimes could be shortened due to ring spreading @xcite .",
    "finally , we showed that , in contrast to the rings in the solar system , some of these extrasolar rings may be warped because of the competing effects of planetary and stellar tide .",
    "observations of warped rings would provide a direct measurement of the planet s @xmath3 .",
    "this is particular exciting , since a planet s @xmath3 reveals information about its interior structure @xcite .",
    "previous constraints on the @xmath3 of extrasolar planets are model dependent as they are derived from the exoplanet s oblateness , which is determined from transit light curves @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite recently placed constraints on the @xmath3 of hd189733b to be @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , measurements of an exoplanet s @xmath3 from warped rings and of its oblateness , would together place limits on its spin period .",
    "close in extrasolar planets with masses comparable to neptune and larger are generally thought to have formed outside the ice line and to have reached their current location by either planet - planet scattering , disk migration , or by kozai oscillations with a stellar companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we showed that due to the proximity to their host stars , @xmath63 for some extrasolar planets .",
    "this has interesting implications for ring formation , since orbits in the outer regions of the hill sphere are chaotic and often unbound , which makes this region unsuitable for harboring rings .",
    "if rings are formed by a larger body that sheds mass as it comes within the roche radius of a given extrasolar planet , then extrasolar planets with @xmath63 are at a disadvantage , since , due to the lack of bound , stable orbits in the outer parts of the hill sphere , mass shed in this region will be lost from the system and will therefore not be available for ring formation .",
    "therefore an extrasolar planet with @xmath91 may be a better candidate for hosting rings than one with @xmath63 .",
    "the observation of extrasolar rings can offer interesting constraints on the obliquity distribution of extrasolar planets .",
    "these insights , in turn , may help to differentiate between various proposed mechanisms by which these warm saturns were transported to their current location .",
    "for example , if planet - planet scattering @xcite and/or kozai oscillations with a stellar companion @xcite are responsible for the observed small semi - major axes of many exoplanets , then the extrasolar planet s obliquities should be large .",
    "if on the other hand , migration in a gaseous disk is primarily responsible for the current location of close in extrasolar planets then their obliquities are likely to be small @xcite .",
    "the obliquity distribution of extrasolar planets therefore provides a valuable probe for differentiating between these proposed planet formation scenarios .",
    "recent measurements of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect find a strong misalignment between the normal of the orbital plane and the stellar spin axis for some exoplanets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is consistent with expectations from planet - planet scattering and kozai oscillations .",
    "furthermore , for sufficiently small semi - major axes , stellar tides will act to damp the exoplanet s obliquity @xcite , while preserving the spin axis orientation at large semi - major axes ( see equation [ e0 ] ) .",
    "hence , one may expect to see a transition from small to larger obliquities as a function of semi - major axis .",
    "observations of such a transition in the obliquity distribution of exoplanets could in principle be used to infer the tidal dissipation function , @xmath11 .",
    "however , the actual obliquity evolution may be complicated by interactions with other planets in the system , as @xcite have shown to be important for the terrestial planets in the solar system . in addition",
    ", stellar tides do not need to damp the planet s obliquity to zero , because for sufficiently high initial obliquities , the planets may settle into a high obliquity cassini state @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "given the various requirements for harboring rings and the fact that rings are most easily discovered around exoplanets with significant obliquities @xcite , we conclude that the majority of the currently known transiting extrasolar planets examined here are not ideal candidates for ring detections , since most of them are too close to their parent star .",
