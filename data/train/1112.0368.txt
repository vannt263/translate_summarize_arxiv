    "the evolution of solid circumstellar material is a competition between the accretional processes that form planets ( when speeds are low ) and the violent collisional processes which in post - formation systems inexorably grind down the material into particles small enough that radiation forces can remove them from the system .",
    "the disappearance of infrared ( ir ) excesses around forming stars ( on 3 - 10  myr time scales ) occurs because the accretional processes win and sequester the huge mass of dust into a ( relatively ) tiny number of objects with very low surface area / mass ratios .",
    "in contrast , the observed debris disks ( known around hundreds of solar - type stars ) are thought to be from collisional dust production as velocities rise during the final stages of planet assembly ( for relatively young stars ) , or triggered around older stars as dust is liberated in higher - speed collisions @xcite .",
    "it is these more mature systems where our understanding of the physical picture is arguably incomplete .",
    "although only @xmath02% of nearby main - sequence stars have massive detectable warm disks ( @xmath4200k ; * ? ?",
    "* ) , several of these disks require dramatic hypotheses to produce the large dust mass estimated . that is , estimates of the collisional grinding of small - body belts indicate that the systems in question should not still possess dust at anywhere near the observed level @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite went so far as to liken the dust mass around bd  + 20  307 as a ` miracle ' given collisional - model predictions .",
    "debris disks are detected and studied via the excess ir flux they produce in the system , caused by the dust re - radiating the absorbed stellar light .",
    "this dust emission can then dominate the stellar photosphere in the ir , where the dust s blackbody peak is set by the equilibrium temperature at the orbital distance ( for a narrow ring ) or at an extended disk s inner edge , because the warmest dust usually dominates the systems dust emission .",
    "for ` realistic ' ( although uncertain ) dust grain size distributions , cross - sectional area and thus thermal emission is dominated by small grains , but the system mass is dominated by the unconstrained larger bodies .",
    "the true observable is thus the mass in grains in the decade larger than the peak wavelength .",
    "known disk systems consist of two types .",
    "the most common are massive and cold , analogous to the solar system s kuiper belt .",
    "a few hotter ( t@xmath4200k ) systems are known , which are massive cousins of our asteroid belt .",
    "an example is hd  69830 , hosting 3 rv - discovered neptune - mass planets inside 0.6 au @xcite and a warm dust ring at @xmath01  au , with an estimated 4x10@xmath5 m@xmath6 in small grains alone @xcite .",
    "production of this dust is problematic @xcite , with hypotheses ranging from comet swarms to super - comets to massive planetary collisions ; it is difficult to judge the plausibility of these mechanisms given the rarity of these outcomes .",
    "dust grains in orbit around a star are quickly destroyed , and must be replenished by a fragmentation cascade , where asteroids within a belt collide and break into progressively smaller pieces @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of a debris disk will be the same as the lifetime of the largest bodies in the source population that are available to be pulverized into dust grains",
    ". very small grains ( @xmath71  @xmath8 m ) are quickly blown away by stellar radiation pressure .",
    "larger grains suffer poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag and spiral into the star in much less than the system s age ; for dust very close to the star ( @xmath00.1  au ) , orbits collapse in only hundreds of years .    in this paper",
    "we search for excess infrared emission , indicating the presence of a dusty debris disk , in systems found by the kepler mission to possess transiting exoplanets . in section  [ sec :",
    "wise ] we define our sample and discuss our methodology for identifying excess candidates , and in section  [ sec : dds ] we provide additional details on the eight stars that have excesses .",
    "section  [ sec : dust ] contains a discussion of the problems associated with having this much dust so close to the host star , and finally section  [ sec : conc ] contains a summary of recent work and this study s contribution relating debris disks to the presence of exoplanets .",
    "wise released preliminary survey data in april 2011 , covering about half the sky in photometric bands centered on 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22  @xmath8 m ( w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to the pointing strategy of the telescope , the coverage on the sky is non - uniform .",
    "many individual images are stacked to produce the preliminary survey data , and some areas of the sky were visited more often than others , providing deeper coverage in those areas .",
    "we use wise data to search for dust emission around the 928 solar - type stars ( f , g , and k0 - 7 spectral types ; t@xmath9=4000 - 7200  k ) that have stellar data ( t@xmath9 , metallicity , and log(@xmath10 ) ) reported in the kepler database as of november 2011 and are candidates to host one or more planets contained in the first kepler data release @xcite .",
    "although most of these transiting planet candidates remain to be independently confirmed , we will refer to them as planets for brevity .",
    "the false - positive rate for single planet systems is @xmath310% @xcite , and is much lower for multiplanet systems @xcite . in any case , the existence or lack of planets is irrelevant for our analysis of ir excess .",
    "there are several m stars reported as having planets in the kepler database , but we did not consider these for analysis because of known systematic problems with modeling the atmospheres of such cool stars @xcite .",
    "we also did not consider the few hotter ( a - type ) stars with known kepler planets in order to keep to stars similar to our sun .",
    "the wise preliminary data release covers about half the kepler field , detecting 439 out of the 928 solar - type stars ; we consider a target to be ` detected ' in a given band if the wise source catalog reports a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) greater than 3 .",
    "( wise does not report fluxes , but rather magnitudes and their corresponding magnitude uncertainty . )",
    "all wise detections are within 1  arcsecond of the coordinates given by the kepler team .",
    "the band wavelengths cover where hot dust emission would peak , which in these systems is also near the equilibrium temperatures of the known kepler planets , most of which are located 0.01 - 0.4  au from their host stars @xcite .",
    "134 of these stars were flagged by the wise team as having contamination from nearby , bright stars in the form of a halo or diffraction spike , or flagged as extended , suggesting probable contamination by a background object .",
    "these stars were not considered further .",
    "the remaining 325 stars are all detected in both wise s w1 ( 3.4  @xmath8 m ) and w2 ( 4.6  @xmath8 m ) bands , @xmath02/3 of these are also are detected in w3 ( 12  @xmath8 m ) , and only six are also detected in w4 ( 22  @xmath8 m ) .      to determine",
    "if the wise data match the expected stellar photospheric spectrum or represent an excess of emission , we use kurucz stellar atmosphere models @xcite chosen from a grid of stellar temperatures , surface gravities , and metallicities to closely match those given for each star in the kepler online database @xcite .",
    "the kurucz models are scaled using photometry from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "these kepler targets are more distant than most known debris disk hosts ( hundreds of parsecs ) , so extinction must be taken into account .",

    "small ( @xmath01  @xmath13 ) systematics are still clearly present .",
    "filled bars show what we accept as significant excesses .",
    "one system ( koi  379 ) shows excess in w1 and w2 above the 5 @xmath13 level ( 7 @xmath13 in w1 and 5 @xmath13 in w2 ) but is not considered to be significant because of an obvious large flux mismatch between the sdss and 2mass photometry , perhaps indicating stellar variability . ]        there are several sources of error in these measurements . to estimate magnitude uncertainties",
    "@xmath13 , the given error bars for each datapoint ( @xmath14 ) and the wise absolute photometric errors ( 2.4 , 2.8 , 4.5 , and 5.7% in w1 - 4 , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are added in quadrature . to assess the significance of each possible excess , the wise magnitude ( @xmath12 )",
    "is subtracted from the predicted stellar magnitudes ( @xmath15 ) , and this is divided by the uncertainty ( @xmath13 ) in that band to give a dimensionless excess .",
    "our sign choice results in positive excesses indicating that the wise flux is higher than the predicted flux .",
    "the uncertainties in the stellar measurements reported by the kepler database are @xmath16200  k in temperature and 0.4  dex in log(@xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "we estimated the contribution of these uncertainties to the significance of the wise excesses by using stellar models from ( t@xmath9 , log(@xmath10 ) ) gridpoints that were varied by the error bars in each of these parameters , and we found that this resulted in @xmath31  @xmath13 changes in the excess . in order to account for this without having a formal number to add to our errors , we adopt the fairly stringent requirement that in order for an excess to be considered significant , it must be more than 5  @xmath13 above the photospheric magnitude .",
    "because of the large photometric aperture on the wise measurements ( 8.25 arcseconds for w1-w3 and 16.5 arcseconds for w4 ) , we visually inspected both the wise and sdss images for each of the stars we find to have an excess and found that there is not contamination from any nearby , bright stars .",
    "in addition , we checked to make sure there were not systematic offsets in the expected position of the stars with excess , indicating contamination by a nearby background source .",
    "the distribution of excesses for each band are shown in figure  [ fig : exhistos ] .",
    "they follow approximately gaussian distributions , with very few datapoints falling above 5  @xmath13 and none falling below -5  @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig : exhistos ] makes it clear that the systematic error here actually underestimates the significance of the excesses ; if anything we are being more conservative with our definition of what is a significant excess and what is not .    figure  [ fig : datahistos ] shows stellar properties for our sample as reported by the kepler team : extinction , stellar temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity .",
    "no trends are seen between any of these data and the presence of a significant excess in any band .",

    "currently , there is not a detection in the w3 or w4 bands , only a low - snr w3 point and a w4 upper limit , so the dust model is not well constrained . for lack of any other guidance on the temperature , we fixed it so the blackbody curve peaks near the w2 effective wavelength and found an acceptable fit .",
    "this results in very hot dust , close to the sublimation temperature of silicates .",
    "this exact temperature is uncertain , but must be quite hot ( @xmath41000  k ) in order to fit both the w1 and w2 datapoints .",
    "but with currently only two datapoints , more detailed dust modelling is unwarranted .",

    "only a very small dust mass ( @xmath010@xmath20  @xmath34 ) is required in this system because of the extremely hot temperatures .",
    "dust this hot has only been observed with optical interferometers , and may actually be fairly common around solar - type stars @xcite , but is difficult to observe .",
    "excesses this hot may have been missed by spitzer spectroscopic surveys , which assumed no excess was present at shorter wavelengths if no slope other than rayleigh - jeans was found in the short wavelength data @xcite .",
    "this excess is perhaps similar to that found for hd  23514 @xcite , which was also detected at short wavelengths only .",
    "the full wise data release should provide a high snr w3 datapoint ; if it remains above the photosphere , the case for a tenuous , but very hot ring of small grains near the planets will be strengthened .",
    "we note that as this paper went to press , the february 2012 kepler data release @xcite provided 3 additional planets in this system , bringing the total number of planet candidates around koi  904 to five , all within 0.2  au .",
    "for the systems with abundant dust interior to 1  au , it is difficult to produce viable steady - state models with such a large mass of small grains remaining so close to their stars .",
    "the pr drag timescale for dust to spiral into the star is extremely short at these close distances : @xmath37 for 3  g  @xmath28 grains @xcite , giving only @xmath010  years for 10  @xmath8 m grains at 0.25  au ( a typical orbital distance in table  [ tab : dds ] ) .",
    "inspiraling grains would not ultimately reach the star in any case , as they should vaporize at @xmath01000 - 1500  k ( depending on composition ) once they get close enough for temperatures to rise this high .",
    "but even before reaching this sublimation temperature , the collisional lifetime may drop below the orbital timescale and dust will quickly be smashed into pieces smaller than the blowout limit .",
    "this timescale ( @xmath38 ) for inter - grain collisions to produce fragments smaller than the blowout limit is very short at these orbital radii and number densities . for a completely coupled narrow ring of width 2@xmath39 and height 2@xmath40 where all grains have the same size @xmath36 , semimajor axis @xmath41 , eccentricity @xmath42 , and inclination @xmath43 , @xmath38 can be approximated by the inverse of the collision frequency , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number density of particles , @xmath46 is the cross - sectional area of one particle , and @xmath47 is the relative speed between particles .",
    "this gives the scaling : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the density of a dust grain , @xmath35 is the total mass of the dust grains , and the approximation has been made that @xmath50 ( where @xmath43 is in radians ) . with @xmath51  yr for our typical warm systems , a steady state requires replenishing @xmath010@xmath22  @xmath34 ( or more ) of dust every year , consuming @xmath41000  @xmath34 of material in 1  gyr , which is unreasonably large .",
    "unrealistic mass - consumption rates implied by such steady - state models are worrying , and have been noted for several main - sequence , warm debris disk systems .",
    "the fractional luminosities l@xmath1/l@xmath25 we measure for kepler systems with excesses also greatly exceed the maximum predicted by the steady - state collisional model of @xcite given these stars mature ages .",
    "the common logical conclusion is that dust masses at this level have to be transient .",
    "several theories have been proposed to explain such systems , including comet swarms , a `` supercomet '' , or a recent collision ( hd  69830 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a late - heavy bombardment - style dynamical instability forcing many icy bodies onto highly eccentric orbits , bringing them in close to the star where they collide or sublimate ( @xmath52  corvi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    another possible explanation for these massive debris disks may be that these stars are all young ( @xmath3100  myr ) and still in the process of clearing their protoplanetary disks .",
    "this hypothesis was offered for three of the seven stars presented by @xcite with disks far too massive to be maintained by a steady - state collisional cascade .",
    "we inspected palomar sky survey images and found no evidence that any of our sample stars are associated with the open clusters in the kepler field , reducing the probability that this explains these systems .",
    "a further option is that the dust may be impact ejecta from asteroids or comets recently striking the extant exoplanets , similar to the production of giant planet rings in our solar system @xcite ; however this is challenging given the super - earths large escape speeds , even if impact speeds are also high .",
    "what is clear is that these dust grains can not be co - located with a planetesimal belt that is producing them .",
    "a massive asteroid belt at 0.2  au or closer is an unsatisfactory dust source because @xmath38 for the planetesimals is @xmath53  gyr @xcite and the source would now be gone .",
    "dust also can not simply spiral in to these close distances from a more distant source in steady - state .",
    "the high optical depths that we calculate must be present in these systems ( ranging from @xmath54 ) are several orders of magnitude higher than the maximum allowed @xcite in a steady - state inspiral scenario , meaning that the dust present in these quantities would destroy itself collisionally before pr drag has a chance to move it any significant distance .    given the large dust masses and the small fraction of stars that possess these excesses , episodic dust production mechanisms provide the most attractive explanation .",
    "dust could be produced by a catastrophic collision between asteroids located further from the star , and we are seeing the dust as it spirals in toward the star .",
    "however , the probability of occurance required by this theory may not be high enough to explain the observed fraction of such systems .",
    "dynamical instabilities forcing many bodies from the outer reaches of these solar systems onto eccentric orbits so they collide close to the star , perhaps similar in style to the late - heavy bombardment in our solar system , might be seen as an attractive theory .",
    "however , the fraction of systems observed to have 24  @xmath8 m excesses observed by spitzer appears to be much too high given the short lifetime of such an event @xcite .",
    "we find ir excesses around eight stars that also host planet candidates .",
    "the masses and luminosities of these excesses are all too large to be explained by a steady - state collisional cascade . given that the wise field coverage was not uniform in depth , and so many of these relatively faint stars suffered from contamination by nearby bright stars , it is challenging to say anything robust about the fraction of these planet - hosting stars that have excesses in our sample . out of the 186 stars with w3 data of snr@xmath43 , five have significant @xmath45  @xmath13 excesses , or @xmath03% . at first glance",
    ", this fraction appears similar to the 2% of solar - type stars with warm excesses @xcite .    however , the fractional luminosities of these kepler systems with excesses are much higher than most known debris disks ( figure  [ fig : dustlocations ] and * ? ? ?",
    "because of the larger distances and thus lower apparent brightness of these kepler systems as compared to most known debris disk systems , only the brightest debris disks would be detected by wise .",
    "presumably the eight systems presented here are the very highest luminosity debris disks in the sample , and many more fainter disks are present around these planet - hosting stars .",
    "this would indicate that the fraction of stars possessing debris disks and kepler - detected exoplanets is actually much higher than the fraction of field stars with debris disks .",
    "surveys with spitzer @xcite have found that hosting a radial velocity - detected exoplanet does not make a star more likely to host a debris disk , and a recent wise survey of exoplanets discovered by ground - based transit searches @xcite has found that the fraction of these stars ( @xmath02% ) to host warm debris disks ( excesses in w3 and w4 ) is similar to that found by @xcite .",
    "the kepler systems studied here are different from other disk - bearing exoplanet systems , whose planets are primarily discovered by the radial - velocity ( rv ) technique , and by ground - based transit searches .",
    "exoplanets from the latter two techniques are mostly large and very close to their stars , with an average mass of @xmath02 jupiter masses and @xmath320% known to be in multiplanet systems @xcite .",
    "the recently announced 1200 kepler exoplanet candidates @xcite are in a different regime , with about 1/3 in multiplanet systems , and having many super - earths ( typically 2 - 6 earth radii ) well inside 1  au . among our excess systems ,",
    "all but two of the planets are neptune mass or smaller ; only one is massive enough to be a hot jupiter .",
    "the resulting correlation we find between a star hosting both small planets and a debris disk inside a few au agrees with the planetary formation and dynamical evolution models presented by @xcite .",
    "this makes sense in a picture where migrating jupiters clean out the terrestrial systems they pass through .",
    "explaining the large dust masses required to produce these excesses remains a huge challenge .",
    "steady - state theories appear to fail completely , as the mass consumption rates required would involve destroying thousands of earth masses of planetary material over the lifetime of these stars .",
    "episodic events such as catastrophic collisions between bodies may provide an explanation , but these events must last long enough and occur frequently enough to result in @xmath03% of solar - type stars in this state at any given moment . much theoretical work needs to be done here .",
    "the upcoming wise full - sky data release will access additional systems , decrease the error bars on existing measurements , and provide longer - wavelength measurements for some of these systems to see if there is dust at larger orbital distances .",
    "spectral data on these candidates would be invaluable , but the host stars are faint .",

    "<S> the kepler mission recently identified 997 systems hosting candidate extrasolar planets , many of which are super - earths . realizing these planetary systems are candidates to host extrasolar asteroid belts , we use mid - infrared data from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) to search for emission from dust in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find excesses around eight stars , indicating the presence of warm to hot dust ( @xmath0100 - 500  k ) , corresponding to orbital distances of 0.1 - 10  au for these solar - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> the strongest detection , koi  1099 , demands @xmath0500  k dust interior to the orbit of its exoplanet candidate . </S>",
    "<S> one star , koi  904 , may host very hot dust ( @xmath01200  k , corresponding to 0.02  au ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the fraction of these exoplanet - bearing stars with detectable warm excesses ( @xmath03% ) is similar to that found by spitzer surveys of solar - type field stars , the excesses detectable in the wise data have much higher fractional luminosities ( l@xmath1/l@xmath2 ) than most known debris disks , implying that the fraction with debris disks of comparable luminosity may actually be significantly higher . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to explain the presence of dust so close to the host stars , generally corresponding to dust rings at radii @xmath30.3  au ; both the collisional and poynting - robertson drag timescales to remove dust from the system are hundreds of years or less at these distances . assuming a steady - state for these systems implies large mass consumption rates with these short removal timescales , meaning that the dust production mechanism in these systems must almost certainly be episodic in nature . </S>"
