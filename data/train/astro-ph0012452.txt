    "the very low , but non - zero , quiescent x - ray luminosity of the bhxn a062000 is difficult to understand in the context of standard viscous accretion disk theory ( mcclintock , horne & remillard 1995 ) , given the continued mass transfer from the companion evidenced by an optically bright disk .",
    "the observations are explained by an advection - dominated accretion flow model , or adaf ( narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 ) .    in an adaf ( see narayan , mahadevan & quataert 1998 and kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 for reviews ) , the energy released by accretion is stored as heat in a radiatively inefficient flow .",
    "should the accreting object be a black hole this energy would be lost from view once it crosses the event horizon , but if the object has a solid surface the energy would be released upon impact with that surface and radiated to infinity .",
    "thus , for the same mass accretion rate , a black hole would be significantly less luminous than a compact star with a surface ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "such a comparison of otherwise similar systems is a promising method for proving the reality of event horizons ( narayan , garcia & mcclintock 1997a , hereafter ngm ) .",
    "x - ray novae ( xn ) containing black hole ( bh ) and neutron star ( ns ) primaries are believed to be similar in many respects .",
    "most importantly , the mass transfer rate from the secondary , measured in eddington units of the primary , is believed to be comparable in bhxn and nsxn of similar orbital periods ( menou 1999 , hereafter m99 ) .",
    "ngm , garcia et al .",
    "1998 ( hereafter g98 ) and m99 showed that quiescent bhxn are much less luminous in x - rays than quiescent nsxn of similar orbital periods , and argued that this provides direct evidence that bhxn are able to `` hide '' their accretion energy behind an event horizon . however , their claims were based on a very small sample in which only one detected bhxn ( a062000 , @xmath1 hrs ) had an orbital period similar to those of the comparison nsxn .",
    "we report here new observations of four bhxn as part of the chandra ao1 hrc team gto program and an additional two bhxn as part of a complementary ao1 go program .",
    "the basic parameters of the chandra observations described here are presented in table  1 .",
    "data were analyzed with a combination of the cxc ciao v1.1 ( cxc 2000a ) , heasarc xspec v11.0 ( arnaud & dorman 2000 ) , and software written by alexey vikhlinin ( vikhlinin 1998 ) . detected fluxes and counting rates were measured over a 0.37.0 kev energy band for acis - s observations , and 0.57.0 kev for acis - i observations , in order to reduce the instrumental background .",
    "the observed on - axis psf is such that 95% of the source flux is contained in the @xmath2 radius source extraction circle ( van speybroeck 1997 ; cxc 2000b ) .",
    "we observed occasional intervals of enhanced background during the observation of a062000 ( see plucinsky & virani 2000 ) , and therefore rejected 6.7  ks of this observation .",
    "the total accumulated background within the source extraction circle is @xmath3  count per source for all the observations .",
    "we defer a full discussion of the chandra spectra of quiescent bhxn to a second paper ( mcclintock 2001 ) . here",

    "a greatly improved upper limit for a fourth short period system , 4u154347 , is nearly comparable to these detections .",
    "in addition , we find a new , ten - times fainter quiescent luminosity for gro  j165540 , which has a period intermediate between the nsxn and the long period bhxn v404  cyg .",
    "the new data points significantly strengthen our earlier claim ( ngm , g98 , m99 ) that bhxn have much lower ( roughly a factor of 100 ) quiescent luminosities than nsxn .",
    "as explained in  1 , such a difference in luminosity is natural if quiescent accretion proceeds via a radiatively inefficient adaf _ and _ if the primaries in bhxn have event horizons .",
    "thus , the new data bolster the evidence for event horizons in bhxn .",
    "our argument relies on the reasonable assumption that the eddington scaled mass accretion rate is similar in quiescent bhxn and nsxn . at the short orbital periods characteristic of the nsxn in our sample , angular momentum loss through gravitational radiation",
    "is expected to be the dominant mechanism driving mass transfer from the secondary .",
    "the eddington - scaled mass transfer rates are then likely to be roughly similar in bhxn and nsxn of similar @xmath40 ( m99 ) . at the long period of v404",
    "cyg and perhaps gro  j165540 , nuclear evolution is expected to drive the mass transfer rate to substantially higher values , and so these systems are less useful for our purposes .",
    "another reason for ignoring these systems is the fact that there are no nsxn with similar @xmath40 for comparison .",
    "we also assume that @xmath43 , the fraction of matter transferred from the secondary which actually reaches the central star , is the same in bhxn and nsxn .",
    "out - flowing winds from an adaf ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 , blandford and begelman 1999 , m99 ) tend to reduce @xmath43 , but there is no reason to expect winds to be stronger ( by a factor of 100 ) in bhxn than in nsxn .",
    "in fact , a centrifugal propeller and/or radio pulsar action could reduce @xmath43 in nsxn without affecting bhxn ( ngm , m99 ) .",
    "therefore , if at all , we expect @xmath43 to be lower in nsxn than in bhxn , rather than the other way round .",
    "this strengthens the case for event horizons in bhxn .    in this connection , we note that 1808 is the least luminous of the nsxn .",
    "it also may have a time averaged mass transfer rate that is lower than that typical of xn , perhaps due to the action of the radio pulsar on the secondary ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) . given that 1808 is the only example of a nsxn which shows permanent coherent pulsations",
    ", it seems possible that it may also have an unusually efficient `` propeller . ''",

    "this point is not obvious since the origin of the optical / uv luminosity is presently unclear . within the adaf model",
    ", it depends on the poorly known radius at which the inner edge of the accretion disk evaporates into the adaf ( e.g. , narayan , mcclintock & yi ( 1996 ) ; narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997b ) .",
    "it also depends on the strength of winds from the adaf ( quataert & narayan 1999 ) .",
    "if the non - stellar optical / uv luminosity originates in the outer accretion disk , or in the hot spot where the mass transfer stream from the secondary impacts the disk , then the fact that the optical / uv luminosities of bhxn and nsxn are similar ( campana & stella 2000 ) provides observational confirmation that the mass transfer rates in the two kinds of system are similar , as we have assumed .",
    "an 0.25 mag modulation in the far - uv flux of a062000 on an orbital time scale suggests that the far - uv flux may be modulated with the orbital phase ( mcclintock 2000 ) , which indicates an origin in the hot spot .",
    "bildsten & rutledge ( 2000 , but see lasota 2000 ) suggest that the x - rays in bhxn may be produced by a rotationally enhanced stellar corona in the secondary , especially in the short period bhxn with the lowest luminosities .",
    "the detection of gro  j0422 + 32 with a luminosity of nearly @xmath62 rules out the coronal interpretation for this system ( lasota 2000 ) , and perhaps all the other bhxn in our sample as well . also , the chandra spectra of a062000 and gro  j165540 do not appear to be consistent with the stellar corona interpretation ( mcclintock 2001 ) .",
    "if some ( or all ) of the x - ray emission in bhxn were coronal , then the accretion luminosities of the black holes would be even lower than our estimates and the argument for event horizons would be further strengthened .",
    "a critical element in our comparison of nsxn and bhxn quiescent luminosities is the assumption that the quiescent x - ray luminosities of nsxn result from accretion .",
    "brown , bildsten & rutledge ( 1998 ) have suggested that the luminosity could be due to crustal heating of the ns during outburst followed by cooling in quiescence .",
    "the rapid variability of the prototypical nsxn cen x-4 ( campana 1997 ) is hard to explain in a cooling model , and shows that at most @xmath63 of the quiescent luminosity of this source is due to crustal cooling ( m99 ) .",
    "in addition , cen x-4 and aql x-1 have substantial power - law tails in their spectra ( carrying about half the total luminosity ) , and it is hard to explain this spectral component with a cooling model .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to assume that accretion accounts for a substantial fraction of the quiescent x - ray luminosity in most nsxn . the optical variability of nsxn in quiescence ( mcclintock & remillard 2000",
    "; jain 2000 ; ilovaisky & chevalier 2000 ) provides ample evidence that accretion continues during quiescence .",
    "regardless of the caveats mentioned above , ultimately the dramatic difference in quiescent x - ray luminosities of bhxn and nsxn needs to be explained .",
    "any explanation is likely to require a fundamental difference in the nature of the primaries in bhxn and nsxn . in our view , any straightforward explanation , whether based on adafs or not , will require postulating an event horizon in bhxn .",
    "the eddington scaled luminosities of some supermassive black holes ( smbh ) in galactic nuclei ( e.g. , garcia 2000 ; baganoff 2000 ) are much smaller than those of the `` stellar mass '' black holes discussed here .",
    "could this be evidence for the event horizon ( narayan et al .",
    "1998 ) ? unfortunately , the mass accretion rates of smbh are difficult to determine observationally ( dimatteo 2000 ; dimatteo , carilli , & fabian 2000 ; quataert , narayan , and reid 1999 ) , and one can not exclude the possibility that the low luminosities of smbh are simply the result of extremely low accretion rates . in the case of quiescent bhxn , we have the luxury of a control sample of nsxn . by comparing quiescent bhxn and nsxn with similar orbital periods ,",
    "we eliminate the uncertainty in the mass accretion rate , and thus obtain more secure evidence for the event horizon .",
