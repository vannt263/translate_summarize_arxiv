    "one of the key stages in the evolution of close binary stars is the common envelope ( ce ) evolution .",
    "when the primary star fills its roche - lobe ( rl ) and the following mass transfer is dynamically unstable so that the secondary can not accrete all the transferred material , the transferred matter will form an envelope embedding both stars and the binary enters the ce evolution .",
    "the secondary star orbits inside the ce , and experiences a drag force by the envelope .",
    "this causes the orbital decay and spiral - in of the star with possible ejection of the envelope ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two main kinds of theories have been developed to describe the envelope ejection process .",
    "one is the @xmath2 formalism , which considers the conversion of orbital energy to overcome the envelope binding energy @xcite .",
    "if the orbital energy of the secondary is large enough to eject the envelope , the system will survive and become a compact binary containing the core of the lobe - filling star and the secondary in a much smaller orbit ; if the orbital energy is not enough , the two stars will coalesce .",
    "the other is the @xmath3 formalism , which considers angular momentum transformation during the spiral - in ( see * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) . despite extensive three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of ce evolution ( for recent reviews , see",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the physics of the ce phase remains poorly understood , including the efficiency with which the ce is ejected from the system .",
    "alternative evolutionary paths have been proposed to avoid the ce evolution , such as those by @xcite and @xcite , who suggested that super - eddington accretion may lead to mass ejection from the system instead of entering the ce stage .    according to @xcite and @xcite , the total binding energy of the envelope",
    "is described by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of the donor star and @xmath6 is its core mass , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the gravitational and internal energy of the stellar matter respectively , @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath10 the percentage of the internal energy contributing to ejection of the envelope , normally taking the value between 0 and 1 .    for convenience the total binding energy of the envelope",
    "is usually expressed as @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the envelope mass , @xmath0 is the binding energy parameter , @xmath13 is the ratio of the rl radius and the orbital separation at the onset of ce , and @xmath14 is normally taken as the stellar radius once a star fills its rl and starts to transfer matter .",
    "if we assume that part of the change of the orbital energy is used to eject the envelope , as described by @xcite , then @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the efficiency of converting the orbital energy to kinetic energy to eject the ce , @xmath17 the mass of the secondary , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 refer to the initial and final orbital separation of the ce phase , respectively .",
    "combine eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , the final orbital separation is related to the pre - ce separation by the following formula , @xmath20 equation ( 4 ) indicates that the orbital separation after ce is sensitively dependent on the product of @xmath16 and @xmath0 , and the convenient way is to treat both @xmath21 and @xmath0 as constants of the order of unity . in most of the population synthesis investigations concerning the evolution of close binaries in the literature ,",
    "@xmath0 was usually taken to be a constant , normally around @xmath22 throughout the evolution of the system .",
    "however , there have lots of works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting that @xmath0 is a variable . @xcite and @xcite found that the value of @xmath0 changes as the star evolves , and reaches far more than @xmath22 in late evolutionary stages for stars with mass between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in recent population synthesis on post - ce binaries , @xcite used linear interpolations of the tabular data in @xcite to calculate @xmath0 .",

    "i stars less massive than @xmath25 and pop .",
    "ii stars , and their results in tabular form may not be easily used .",
    "obviously more advanced population synthesis requires a simple description of the parameter @xmath0 for better constraints on the initial stellar population . in this work",

    "we adopt the latest stellar evolution code twin developed by @xcite and modified later by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one of the major improvements of the code is that , when a low - mass star is reaching the he flash igniting point , the code will automatically generate a zero - age horizontal branch star with both the same core and total mass which enables further evolution .",
    "we take the mixing length parameter @xmath26 to be 2.0 and follow the evolution of both pop .",

    "to descriminate the effect of internal energy , we set @xmath56 to be @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and calculate the respective binding energy parameter , namely @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "we have made calculations for both pop .",
    "i and pop .",
    "ii stars , with mass range from 1 to 20 @xmath59 . for each star",
    "we follow its evolution until its age exceeds 15 gyr or the code crushes for rapid c burning . once a star evolves to produce a h - exhausted core we calculate the binding energy of its envelope and accordingly @xmath58 and @xmath57 , both with and without the internal energy of the stellar matter . in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we show some examples of the evolution of @xmath60 and @xmath57 with respect to the stellar radius @xmath35 .",
    "since a star experiences both expansion and shrinkage throughout its life , we divide its evolution into three stages after the star leaves the main - sequence according to the change of the stellar radius , to make the fitting of @xmath0 more practicable .",
    "stage 1 begins at the center h exhaustion and ends when the star starts to shrink ( i.e. , near center he ignition ) .",
    "stage 2 follows and ends when the star starts to expand again , we use @xmath61 center he abundance as the end point of stage 2 . as a less massive star expands again before its center he exhaustion ,",
    "we simply assume that stage 2 ends when the respective hb star starts to expand again . ] .",
    "stage 3 begins after that and continues till the end of the evolution .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show that both @xmath58 and @xmath57 vary during the evolution of stars . for @xmath62 star ,",
    "both @xmath58 and @xmath57 decrease with @xmath35 , but their magnitudes are around unity before the he flash .",
    "after that the values of @xmath0 have a big decrease along with the stellar radius , but @xmath63 throughout the evolution .",
    "more massive stars often experience rapid increase in @xmath0 in stage 3 . for stars with mass from @xmath64 to @xmath65 ( the mass range is related to metallicity ) ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath57 take the values @xmath66 before the star reaches stage 3 , during which the internal energy dominates , and the total binding energy finally becomes positive .",
    "the resulting @xmath58 increases rapidly and eventually turns out to be infinity , while @xmath57 remains to be around 0.5 . for stars massive than @xmath67 , the binding energy decreases in stage 3 but never becomes positive , correspondingly @xmath58 takes smaller value and @xmath57 is around @xmath22 . for stars more massive than @xmath68",
    ", @xmath0 even drops below @xmath22 for most @xmath35 .",
    "the extreme case in our calculation is for @xmath69 stars , in which both @xmath58 and @xmath57 evolve to be @xmath70 in stage 3 .    to provide easy - to - use formulae of @xmath58 and @xmath57",
    ", we make polynomial fitting with the following formulation , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is @xmath58 or @xmath57 , and @xmath73 is the stellar radius @xmath35 in most cases . for low - mass stars",
    ", we also use the fractional mass of the envelope @xmath74 as the fitting variable as suggested by @xcite .",
    "in limited cases we use @xmath75 instead of @xmath58 as the @xmath72 variable during stage 3 when the value of @xmath58 is too large , and take @xmath76 as @xmath72 and @xmath77 as @xmath73 in several cases ( see tables [ tbl1 ] and [ tbl2 ] for details ) . in tables",
    "[ tbl1 ] and [ tbl2 ] we present the fitting parameters for pop .",
    "i and pop .",
    "ii stars , respectively .",
    "our calculations show that stars with different masses have different values of @xmath0 , and @xmath0 is not constant for the same star in different evolutionary stages . from figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , @xmath58 diverges from @xmath22 for most @xmath37 and @xmath35 , and it is obvious that assuming a constant @xmath78 in population synthesis calculations is far from fact and therefore lack of reliability .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the range of @xmath57 is much narrower than that of @xmath60 .",
    "of course the actual value of @xmath0 should lie between @xmath57 and @xmath58 since not all of the internal energy contributes to the ejection of the envelope @xcite .",
    "as we have given the fitting formulae for @xmath0 , the results can be useful for future population synthesis works .",
    "however , this approach should be adopted carefully , especially in the cases when the binding energies are positive ( specifically , @xmath23 to @xmath79 for pop .",
    "i stars and @xmath80 to @xmath81 for pop .",
    "ii stars at the end of their agb phase when their radii expand to be more than hundreds of solar radius , and ionizaiton energy dominates the total binding energy ) . ] , and where the efficiency of conversion of ionization energy to kinetic energy may differ from the efficiency of conversion of other forms of internal energy . as we can see from eqs .",
    "( [ equ1 ] ) and ( [ equ2 ] ) , the calculated values of @xmath0 depend on the stellar mass , the core mass , the envelope mass distribution and the percentage of internal energy that contributes to envelope ejection",
    ". factors like metallicity and stellar wind mass loss also affect the stellar evolution and the resulting values of @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , the different definitions of core - envelope boundary lead to different stellar core mass and therefore affect the calculated results .",
    "our results agree reasonably with that of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , although there exist some differences .",
    "@xcite proposed that @xmath0 is almost independent of the stellar chemical composition . from our calculations",
    "we find that given the same mass , pop .",
    "i and pop .",
    "ii stars have different @xmath0-values ( see figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "for example , the mass range in which the values of @xmath58 can become negative is narrower for pop .",
    "ii stars than for pop .",
    "i ones . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare the evolution of the two @xmath0s for a @xmath82 star with different metallicity .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath0 evolutions show little difference at the beginning , but later they diverge from each other , and the values of @xmath0 for the pop .",
    "i star always lie above those of the pop .",
    "ii star in late evolutionary stages .",
    "the reason is as follows . the binding energy ( absolute value ) of the pop .",
    "i star is either comparable with ( in early evolutionary stage ) or lower than ( due to the contribution of ionization energy ) that of the pop .",
    "since the pop .",
    "i star evolves slower than the pop .",
    "ii one , as a result the pop .",
    "i star has a smaller h - exhausted core and higher - mass envelope than the pop .",
    "ii star when they have the same radii , thus higher @xmath0 values .",
    "we used the 15% h abundance layer as the stellar core - envelope boundary to calculate the binding energy and @xmath0 , since the core mass from such definition increases in most of the time and is suitable for calculating the binding energy ( eggleton 2009 ) . note that @xcite used the 10% h abundance layer as the core - envelope boundary , and in our calculation we found that the two definitions give similar results .",
    "there are other criteria to define this boundary , such as the maximum energy generation layer or the density gradient criteria @xcite . according to @xcite and @xcite , most of these criteria give outer core boundary and higher core mass . in general ,",
    "if the total stellar mass is a constant , a more massive core will decrease the total binding energy of the envelope and result in a larger @xmath0-value @xcite .",
    "in other words , the @xmath0-values we calculated may be regarded as the lower limit of the actual ones .",
    "stars more massive than @xmath83 lose @xmath84 to @xmath85 of its total mass during its evolution , which can affect the stellar structure and the values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have also found that @xmath0 is sensitive to the wind mass loss for massive stars , and including stellar wind leads to higher binding energy ( absolute value ) and lower value of @xmath0 .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath58 can take values significantly larger than @xmath22 during the late - stage evolution of stars with mass between @xmath86 and @xmath83 , which will significantly increase the efficiency of envelope ejection .",
    "if we consider an evolved giant or agb star in this mass range with @xmath87 , the envelope binding energy may be much smaller compared to that with @xmath78 .",
    "it is then much easier for its companion to eject the ce , and to produce wider binaries after the ce phase .",
    "it is also worth noticing that both @xmath57 and @xmath58 are less than @xmath33 in the late evolutionary stages of massive stars . for stars massive than @xmath88",
    ", @xmath0 even lies below @xmath89 . as a result ,",
    "the actual envelope ejection efficiency for these stars decreases considerably .",
    "taking a @xmath69 pop .",
    "i giant star as an example . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , both @xmath58 and @xmath57 are @xmath70 , which means that the envelope binding energy become much higher .",
    "the secondary has to convert more orbital energy to eject the envelope , which probably leads to a much tighter final orbit , or even a merger .",
    "these may have important implications for the formation and evolution of related binaries that produce compact stars , which will be discussed in future works in more detail .",
