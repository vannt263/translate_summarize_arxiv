    "_    the aim of the present communication is to give a complete description of the order of contact ( at @xmath2 ) for the twisted cubics mentioned above .",
    "in particular , it will be shown in theorem [ thm:1 ] that the twisted cubics with parameter @xmath5 play a distinguished role , a result that seems to be missing in the literature . furthermore , since the order of contact is not a self - dual notion , we also investigate the order of dual contact for twisted cubics @xmath1 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , in the dual setting the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are exceptional ; see theorem [ thm:2 ] .    in section [ para:2.4 ]",
    "we show that certain results of theorem [ thm:1 ] have a natural interpretation in terms of the _ twofold isotropic geometry _ which is based on the absolute flag @xmath8 , and in terms of the _ isotropic geometry _ in the plane @xmath4 which is given by the flag @xmath9 .",

    "in fact , via the first derivative of the local parametrization @xmath97 of @xmath1 we see that @xmath98 is given by @xmath99 the plane at infinity carries in a natural way the structure of an _ isotropic _ ( or _ galileian _ ) _ plane _ with the absolute flag @xmath9 .",

    "one could also derive the assertion in theorem [ thm:1 ] ( a ) as follows : we introduce an auxiliary euclidean metric in a neighbourhood of @xmath2 , and we take into account that the ratio of the euclidean curvatures at @xmath2 of the curves @xmath1 and @xmath96 ( the curves @xmath38 and @xmath104 ) equals @xmath105 ; see @xcite for this theorem of e.  beltrami .",
    "the flag @xmath8 turns @xmath10 into a _",

    "( or _ flag _ ) _ space_. the definition of metric notions in this space is based upon the identification of @xmath106 with @xmath107 , and the canonical basis of @xmath108 ; see @xcite .    by @xcite",
    ", each cubic parabola @xmath1 has the _ twofold isotropic conical curvature _ @xmath109 .",
    "hence the following characterization follows .    among all cubic parabolas @xmath1 on the cayley surface @xmath15 ,",
    "the cubic parabolas with @xmath5 are precisely those with maximal twofold isotropic conical curvature .",
    "yet another interpretation is as follows : the regular matrix @xmath110 yields a _",
    "homothetic transformation _ of @xmath10 which maps the cubic parabola @xmath111 to @xmath112 , since @xmath113 as all points at infinity are invariant , the corresponding isotropic circles @xmath114 and @xmath115 coincide .",
    "this homothetic transformation is identical if , and only if , @xmath5 .",
    "the cayley surface @xmath15 admits a @xmath0-parameter collineation group ; see @xcite formula ( 9 ) .",
    "the action of this group on the family of all cubic parabolas @xmath1 is described in @xcite , formula ( 12 ) .",
    "( in the last part of that formula some signs have been misprinted .",
    "the text there should read @xmath116 ) .",
    "by virtue of this action , our previous result on homothetic transformations can be generalized to other cubic parabolas on @xmath15 .",
    "* .. * the question remains how to distinguish between cubic parabolas @xmath1 and @xmath38 satisfying the first condition ( @xmath39 ) in theorem [ thm:1 ] ( a ) , and those which meet the second condition ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "a similar question arises for the two conditions in theorem [ thm:1 ] ( b ) .",
    "we shall see that such a distinction is possible if we consider the _ dual curves _ which are formed by the osculating planes ( i.e.  cubic developables ) . recall that @xmath1 and @xmath38 have , by definition , _ dual contact of order @xmath65 _ at a common osculating plane @xmath117 , if their dual curves have contact of order @xmath65 at the `` point '' @xmath117 of the dual projective space .",
    "we shall identify the dual of @xmath13 with the vector space @xmath118 in the usual way ; so planes ( i.e.  points of the dual projective space ) are given by non - zero _ row vectors_. thus , for example , a plane @xmath119 is tangent to the cayley surface ( [ eq : cayley ] ) if , and only if , @xmath120 we note that all these tangent planes comprise a cayley surface in the dual space .",
    "for each twisted cubic there exists a unique null polarity ( symplectic polarity ) which takes each point of the twisted cubic to its osculating plane . in particular , the null polarity of the cubic parabola @xmath44 is induced by the linear bijection @xmath121        1 .   second order dual contact at @xmath4 if , and only if , @xmath39 ; 2 .",
    "third order dual contact at @xmath4 if , and only if , @xmath39 and @xmath41 , or @xmath122 ; 3 .",
    "fourth order dual contact at @xmath4 if , and only if , @xmath123 and @xmath41 .",
    "the matrix @xmath124 determines a duality of @xmath10 which maps the set of points of @xmath44 onto the set of osculating planes of @xmath1 . since the product of a duality and the inverse of a duality is a collineation , we obtain the following :    the order of dual contact at @xmath4 of the given curves @xmath1 and @xmath38 coincides with the order of contact at @xmath2 of the cubic parabola @xmath44 and that cubic parabola which arises from @xmath44 under the collineation given by the matrix @xmath125 here @xmath126 denotes an entry that will not be needed .",
    "we now proceed as in the proof of theorem [ thm:1 ] . by substituting the entries of the matrix above into ( [ eq : koeffizienten ] ) , we read off necessary and sufficient conditions for dual contact of order @xmath65 at the plane @xmath4 of @xmath1 and @xmath38 .    for @xmath69",
    "we get the single condition @xmath127 which proves the assertion in ( a ) . by ( a )",
    ", we let @xmath39 for the discussion of @xmath71 . then @xmath72 vanishes and we arrive at the condition @xmath128 from which ( b ) is immediate .",
    "finally , for @xmath75 we distinguish two cases : if @xmath39 and @xmath41 then @xmath76 vanishes and we are lead to the condition @xmath129 note that here @xmath78 , since @xmath79 .",
    "the proof of ( c ) will be finished by showing that the case @xmath122 does not occur . from the assumption",
    "@xmath122 follows the first condition @xmath130 now , letting @xmath41 , the second condition @xmath131 is obtained .",
    "however , both conditions can not be satisfied simultaneously , since the first condition and @xmath79 together imply that @xmath78 .     * .. * by combining the results of theorem [ thm:1 ] and theorem [ thm:2 ] , it is an immediate task to decide whether or not two ( not necessarily distinct ) cubic parabolas @xmath1 and @xmath38 have contact at @xmath2 and at the same time dual contact at @xmath4 of prescribed orders .",
    "in particular , we infer that two cubic parabolas of this kind , with fourth order contact at @xmath2 and fourth order dual contact at @xmath4 , are identical .",
    "let us choose a _ fixed _ real number @xmath60 .",
    "we consider the local parametrization @xmath132 of @xmath15 ; its image is @xmath133 , i.e. the affine part of @xmath15 . for our fixed @xmath134 and @xmath135 the affine parts of the parabolic cylinders ( [ eq : zylinder ] ) form a partition of @xmath136 ; see figure [ abb2 ] .",
    "hence @xmath137 is injective so that through each point @xmath138 there passes a unique curve @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , we can define a mapping @xmath139 of @xmath133 into the dual projective space by @xmath140    the image of the affine part of the cayley surface @xmath15 under the mapping @xmath139 described in _ ( [ eq : sigma ] ) _ consists of tangent planes of a cayley surface for @xmath141 , and of tangent planes of a hyperbolic paraboloid for @xmath142 .",
    "as the null polarity of @xmath35 arises from the matrix @xmath143 so the @xmath139-image of a point @xmath144 is the plane which is described by the non - zero row vector @xmath145 in discussing @xmath146 there are two cases :    \\(i ) suppose that @xmath147 . then a duality of @xmath10 is determined by the regular matrix @xmath148 letting @xmath149 the transpose of @xmath150 is easily seen to equal the row vector in ( [ eq : polar ] ) . hence @xmath146 is part of a cayley surface in the dual space which in turn , by ( [ eq : dual_cayley ] ) , is the set of tangent planes of a cayley surface in @xmath10 .",
    "\\(ii ) if @xmath151 then the row vector ( [ eq : polar ] ) simplifies to @xmath152 thus the set @xmath146 is part of the non - degenerate ruled quadric in the dual space with equation @xmath153 ( in terms of dual coordinates ) . in other words",
    ", @xmath154 consists of tangent planes of a hyperbolic paraboloid in @xmath10 .",
    "let us add the following remark .",
    "the linear fractional transformation @xmath155 is an involution such that our fixed @xmath141 goes over to @xmath156 , as defined in ( [ eq : betastrich ] ) , whereas @xmath157 . in particular , if @xmath7 then @xmath158 .",
    "this explains the relation between theorem [ thm:1 ] ( c ) and theorem [ thm:2 ] ( c ) .",
    "also the fixed values of @xmath159 are noteworthy :    for @xmath160 the curves @xmath161 are _ asymptotic curves _ of @xmath15 , i.e. , the osculating plane of @xmath161 at each point @xmath162 is the tangent plane of @xmath15 at @xmath163 .",
    "this means that the planes of the set @xmath146 are tangent planes of @xmath15 rather than tangent planes of another cayley surface .    for @xmath164",
    "it is immediate form ( [ eq : n_allgemein ] ) that the matrix @xmath165 does not depend on the parameter @xmath166 , whence in this particular case the mapping @xmath139 is merely the restriction of a null polarity of @xmath10 to the affine part of the cayley surface @xmath15 .",
