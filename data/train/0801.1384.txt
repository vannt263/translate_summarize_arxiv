    "the force between electrically neutral metallic plates separated by a small vacuum gap ( of micron / submicron dimensions ) , as predicted by the eminent dutch physicist h.b .",
    "casimir in 1948 , still attracts considerable interest . on one hand",
    "this interest is curiosity driven since the force is connected with the zero - point fluctuations in vacuum , and on the other hand the interest stems from practical applications because modern microtechnology approaches the limit where the force starts to influence the performance of microdevices . during the past decade the casimir force was measured with increasing precision in a number of experiments using different techniques such as torsion pendulum @xcite , atomic force microscope ( afm ) @xcite , microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite and different geometrical configurations : sphere - plate @xcite , plate - plate @xcite , crossed cylinders @xcite . in most cases the bodies were covered with gold evaporated or sputter deposited to a thickness of 100 - 200 @xmath3 .",
    "relatively low precision , 15% , in the force measurement was reached for the plate - plate configuration @xcite because of the parallelism problem . in the torsion pendulum experiment",
    "@xcite the force was measured with an accuracy of 5% . in the experiments",
    "@xcite errors were claimed on the level of 1% . in the most precise up to date experiment @xcite the experimental errors claimed to be as low as 0.5% .",
    "comparison between theory and experiment answers an important question : how accurately do we understand the origin of the force ? to make a precise evaluation of the force taking into account real conditions of the experiments is equally difficult as to make a precise measurement . in its original form , the casimir force @xcite given by @xmath4 was calculated between the ideal metals at zero temperature .",
    "it depends only on the fundamental constants and the distance between the plates @xmath5 .",
    "the force between real materials was derived for the first time by lifshitz @xcite .",
    "the material properties enter the lifshitz formula via the frequency dependent dielectric function @xmath6 .",
    "this formula became the basis for all precise calculations of the force .",
    "corrections to eq .",
    "( [ fc ] ) can be very large especially at small separations ( @xmath7 ) between bodies .",
    "the lifshitz formula accounts for real optical properties of the materials , and for finite temperature effects .",
    "an additional source of corrections to the force is the surface roughness of interacting plates @xcite .    in all the experiments mentioned above the bodies",
    "were covered with metallic films but the optical properties of these films have never been measured .",
    "it is commonly accepted @xcite that these properties can be taken from the handbooks tabulated data @xcite together with the drude parameters , which are necessary to extrapolate the data to low frequencies .",
    "this might still be a possible way to estimate the force , but it is unacceptable for calculations with controlled precision .",
    "lamoreaux @xcite was the first who recognized this problem .",
    "the reason is very simple @xcite : optical properties of deposited films depend on the method of preparation , and can differ substantially from sample to sample .",
    "recently analysis of existing optical data for @xmath0 was undertaken @xcite to explore how significant is the effect of variation of the optical properties on the casimir force .",
    "it was demonstrated that different sets of the data deviate considerably .",
    "this variation influences the casimir force on the level of 5% in the distance range of the most precise experiments .",
    "significant sample dependence of the force raises doubts on reported agreement between theory and experiment within 1% precision @xcite .",
    "this is an important issue that has to be further thoroughly investigated .    in this paper",
    "we present the optical properties of @xmath0 films of different thickness deposited in two different evaporators on silicon and/or mica substrates , unannealed or annealed after the deposition .",
    "moreover , we will discuss the influence of measured optical properties of gold films on the precise evaluation of the casimir force .",
    "for the first time the characterization of the films was performed over a wide frequency range .",
    "it was done ellipsometrically using the infrared variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer in the wavelength range 1.9 - 33  @xmath1 , and the vacuum ultraviolet ellipsometer in the range 0.14 - 1.7 @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , the film roughness was characterized with atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , and the electron density in the films was estimated from x - ray reflectivity measurements .",
    "careful analysis of the data is performed to extract the values of the drude parameters .",
    "it includes joint fits of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function , or refractive index and extinction coefficient in the low frequency range ; the kramers - kronig consistency of the dielectric function or complex refractive index performed at all frequencies .",
    "the most important conclusions that follow from this analysis is that the films deposited at the same conditions , but having different thicknesses , have considerably different dielectric functions ; annealing or change of the deposition method showed also influence on the optical properties . at any rate this difference can not be ignored in a precise calculation of the casimir force .",
    "we demonstrate that the optical data typically used for the force evaluation in former studies are far away from that found in our samples .",
    "the main reason for this deviation is the use of the drude parameters , which correspond to a perfect gold single crystal rather than real polycrystalline films , containing a number of different defects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe preparation and characterizations of @xmath0 films and make comparison with results known from literature .",
    "analysis of the optical data is presented in sec .",

    "the term `` pseudo '' is used here since the films may not be completely isotropic or uniform ; they are rough , and may contain absorbed layers of different origin because they have been exposed to air .",
    "if this is the case then the dielectric function extracted from the raw data will be influenced by these factors .",
    "for our films we expect high level of isotropy but they can be not uniform in depth .",
    "it means that the dielectric function we extract from the data will be averaged over the distance of the order of the penetration depth .",
    "the roughness and absorbed layer can have some significance in the visible and ultraviolet ranges but not in the infrared , where the absorption on free electrons of metals is very large .",
    "moreover , the effect of roughness is expected to be small since for all films @xmath12 is much smaller than the smallest wavelength 137 @xmath3 . because the infrared domain is the most important for the casimir force we will consider @xmath27 extracted from the raw data as a good approximation for the dielectric function of the top layer of a gold film .    the dielectric function is connected with the ellipsometric parameter @xmath28 for an isotropic and uniform solid as @xmath29 .",
