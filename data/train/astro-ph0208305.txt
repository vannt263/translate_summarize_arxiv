    "the recent detections of candidate low - mass companions to local disk stars via transits by several groups has verified the possibility of discovering statistically significant numbers of extrasolar planets through ground based transit surveys ( udalski et  al .",
    "2002 , mallen - ornelas et  al .",
    "although such surveys will provide valuable information about the types of planetary systems that exist , it will be difficult to piece together the dynamical , chemical , and evolutionary history of the parent stars .",
    "the parent stars physical properties are particularly important since radial velocity surveys for low - mass companions have revealed the trend of the fraction of stars with planets increases as a function of the metallicity of the parent star .",
    "the interpretation of this trend is unclear and more information is needed .",
    "simple stellar systems , such as globular clusters and open clusters , are an excellent laboratory for transit surveys .",
    "such fields provide @xmath6 stars of the same age and metallicity .",
    "interpretation of the null result for the metal - poor globular cluster 47 tuc ( gilliland et  al .",
    "2000 ) has been complicated by the possible effects of the dense stellar environment on planet formation and survival .",
    "therefore , we are concentrating on metal - rich , sparser open clusters . by observing main - sequence stars in 4 - 5 open clusters of known ( and varied ) age , metallicity , and stellar density",
    ", we will gain insight into how these various properties affect planet formation , migration , and survival .",
    "our primary instrumentation is the mdm 8192x8192 4x2 mosaic ccd imager . in combination with the mdm 2.4 m telescope it yields a 25x25 arcmin@xmath7 field of view with 0.18\" / pixel .",
    "the ohio state university has access to a 25% share of the mdm facility ; in 2001 we were granted 19 nights on the 2.4 m , we have been granted @xmath8 nights during fall 2002 , and we expect to obtain 20 - 40 nights for each cluster in the future with the same instrumental setup .",
    "in oct . 2001 we obtained data over 19 nights for the open cluster ngc 1245 , an old ( @xmath9 gyr ) , solar - metallicity cluster with @xmath10 members .",
    "we lost 4 nights to inclement weather and the remainder were non - photometric , resulting in a total of 960 @xmath11-band images .",
    "we performed the photometric reduction using the dophot psf fitting package .",
    "differential light curves for individual target stars were derived by locating 13 optimal comparison stars close to each target .",
    "we plan to test difference imaging techniques in the future .",
    "the points in figure 1(a ) show the rms scatter in the light curves as a function of i - magnitude .",
    "the lower , tight sequence of points in figure 1(a ) shows the expected photon noise . at the faint end ,",
    "the rms scatter is only @xmath12 larger than the photon limit . at the bright end",
    ", there is a systematic error @xmath13 , which we suspect is due to flat - fielding errors .",
    "the lines in figure 1(a ) represent the transit depth for a 1.3 and @xmath14 planet .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the ratio between the transit depth of a @xmath14 planet and the light curve rms scatter .",
    "there are @xmath15 stars with sufficient @xmath16 to detect a @xmath17 transit . also shown in this figure",
    "is the estimated mass of the parent star assuming a 1 gyr , solar - metallicity population at 2.5 @xmath18 and e(b - v)=0.26 .",
    "we estimate @xmath19 of these stars to be cluster members .",
    "a preliminary search through the data has revealed a transit candidate with a depth @xmath5 .",
    "we observed the transit on two separate nights and the light curves are shown in figure 3 .",
    "unfortunately , the transit is unlikely to be a planetary transit , since the transit shape is indicative of a grazing binary eclipse .",
    "planetary transits tend to be boxier in shape with more rapid ingress and egress durations and flat - bottom eclipses ( seager & mallen - ornelas 2003 ) .",
    "however , this example demonstrates the extreme importance of sufficient time resolution in transit surveys in order to easily discard signals that can be confused with planetary transits .",
    "we calculate our sensitivity to planetary transits using the formalism outlined in gaudi ( 2000 ) . taking into account the cluster luminosity function , distance , and reddening , our observational photometric sensitivity and window function , and assuming that @xmath2 of stars",
    "have @xmath17 companions evenly distributed in log semi - major axis between 0.03 and 0.3 au , we expect to detect @xmath4 transits in the ngc 1245 data set .",
    "the curves in figure 3(a ) show the @xmath20 upper confidence limits we can place on the fraction of stars with planets for a given configuration of planetary companion separation versus radius . for instance , based on our data obtained for ngc 1245 and a null result , we can exclude greater than @xmath21 of the cluster members having a jupiter - sized object orbiting within @xmath22 .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the theoretical limits if we had observed ngc 1245 for 40 nights , with 8 hours each night , using the identical instrumental setup .",
    "such results may be achieved with our upcoming 60 nights ( 30 on mdm 2.4 m and 30 on mdm 1.3 m ) to observe ngc 2099 which is 2.5 times closer than , and has comparable number of members to ngc 1245 .",
    "we have demonstrated that we can easily achieve the photometric precision necessary to detect jupiter - sized transits around main - sequence stars . in light of the uncertain radial velocity results of the fraction of stars with planets as a function of metallicity ,",
    "our theoretical expectations show that even without the discovery of planetary transits our survey will place interesting constraints on this relation for a population of determinable metallicity , age , and stellar density .",
    "we emphasize the importance of sufficient time resolution in transit surveys , as has been demonstrated by other surveys ( mallen - ornelas et  al .",
    "we will continue to optimize our transit detection methods to search for lower amplitude ( @xmath23 ) transit signals .",
