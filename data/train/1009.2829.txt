    "a micron - size superconducting quantum interference device ( @xmath0-squid ) consists of two superconducting dayem bridges or weak links ( wl ) @xcite , of dimension of the order of the superconducting coherence length , in parallel , forming a loop with area in the @xmath0m@xmath1 range .",
    "a single wl behaves very much like a josephson junction @xcite with the supercurrent approximately given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the critical current and @xmath4 is the phase difference across the junction .",
    "when two such junctions are fabricated in parallel in a squid , interference between the two current branches gives an oscillatory behavior of the critical current @xmath3 with the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the flux period is equal to the flux quanta @xmath5 = 2.05 @xmath610@xmath7 t.m@xmath1 .",
    "this makes the squid a very sensitive device to measure magnetic field .",
    "while the flux sensitivity achieved by conventional squids is better than @xmath8 , for a @xmath0-squid it has only been about @xmath9@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-squids have been used to study the magnetization reversal @xcite of an isolated magnetic nano particle , the persistent current in phase - coherent rings @xcite and also in scanning squid microscopy @xcite .",
    "an improved sensitivity of @xmath0-squids would be useful for probing ferromagnetic particles of smaller size or where the surface spins play an important role @xcite .",
    "other than the sensitivity , the hysteresis in @xmath0-squids current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristic ( see e.g. ref . ) is a major hurdle as it ( 1 ) increases the measurement time , ( 2 ) complicates the measurement electronics , ( 3 ) changes the temperature of the sample placed in close proximity with the @xmath0-squid .",
    "thus it is important to understand this hysteresis and devise ways of eliminating it .",
    "hysteresis in the current - voltage characteristic is a very common phenomena for many superconducting nano - structured systems , especially wls .",
    "it includes conventional superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( s - i - s ) josephson junctions @xcite , superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( s - n - s ) junctions @xcite , superconducting nano - wires @xcite and superconducting @xmath0-bridges @xcite .",
    "when the current is ramped up from zero across such junctions , the system suddenly switches to a non - zero voltage state at the critical current @xmath3 .",
    "after switching , when the current is ramped down , the system comes back to a zero - voltage state at a particular current , called the retrapping current @xmath11 . at very low temperature , the retrapping current can be smaller than the critical current : @xmath12 .",
    "this defines an hysteretic i - v curve .",
    "a number of models have been proposed in the last few decades to understand the hysteresis in superconducting wls .",
    "the resistively and capacitively shunted junction ( rcsj ) @xcite model predicts the i - v curve for a conventional s - i - s junction very well . in this case , the capacitance across the junction is responsible for the hysteresis . but for lateral junctions ( either s - n - s junctions or constrictions ) , the geometrical capacitance is too small to explain hysteresis .",
    "hence an alternative theory of an effective capacitance @xmath13 was proposed @xcite , where one equates the charge relaxation time @xmath14 with the cooper pair relaxation time @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the normal resistance and @xmath17 is the superconducting gap parameter .",
    "the same method was recently extended to s - n - s junctions @xcite by equating @xmath14 with the diffusion time of andreev pairs . though these methods reproduce some of the features of the i - v curves , no justification behind the origin of an effective capacitance has been found .    recently , courtois et al . @xcite",
    "have unambiguously shown , by directly measuring the electronic temperature , that heating is responsible for hysteresis in s - n - s junctions . according to the  hot - spot \" model of skocpol et al .",
    "@xcite , the heat generated in the resistive region of the wl raises locally its temperature above the critical temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the temperature goes down to the bath temperature as one moves away from the hot spot .",
    "this gives rise to a normal metal - superconductor interface along the surface defined by @xmath19 .",
    "the interface location is self - consistently determined by the heat generated and the coupling to the thermal bath .",
    "it was found that below a certain current , identified as the retrapping current , this interface becomes unsustainable and the wl turns fully superconducting . for a short wl",
    ", the hot spot may spread beyond the wl and into the electrodes .",
    "this  hot - spot \" model reproduced most of the features of the i - v characteristics of superconducting wls .",
    "it also predicted a @xmath20 dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath22 ; however the latter was not experimentally verified .",
    "further , this model ignored the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of superconductor . incorporating an approximate form for this temperature dependence , tinkham et al .",
    "described the i - v characteristics of free standing superconducting nano - wires @xcite .",
    "in this case , the n - s interface occurs inside the long nano - wire , making the problem one - dimensional .",
    "again , this work did not include the temperature dependence of the hysteresis in the i - v characteristics .    in this paper",
    ", we describe an effective one - dimensional thermal model to find out the temperature profile near a short wl connected to wide electrodes .",
    "we calculate the i - v characteristics as well as the ( bath ) temperature dependence of the retrapping current .",
    "our model predicts how the normal - superconducting ( n - s ) interface position varies with various parameters like temperature , current , and geometry .",
    "we also discuss the detailed temperature profile and how it changes with the bias current .",
    "using the temperature dependence of the critical current near @xmath18 , we find that above a certain temperature @xmath23 , hysteresis disappears .",
    "the effect of the wl geometrical parameters on @xmath23 is discussed quantitatively .",
    "as the same model is directly relevant to @xmath0-squids , we test it on several such samples .",
    "our model fits our data very well .",
    "finally , we discuss how the non - hysteretic regime can be achieved over a wider temperature range , followed by conclusions .",
    "following the  hot - spot \" model @xcite , we consider a single wl connected to two extended electrodes , as shown in [ fig : wl]a , and investigate the temperature distribution around it in the resistive state .",
    "we assume a local quasi - equilibrium condition so that a local temperature can be defined at each point of the sample .",
    "the length and width of the wls under study are in 50 - 200 nm range , of the order of the coherence length of bulk nb ( @xmath24 39 nm ) . in this range",
    ", a wl behaves very much like a josephson junction @xcite .",
    "since the wl size is very small , we assume that in the resistive state the entire wl region stays at a uniform temperature .",
    "in reality , the wl will have certain spatial temperature variation , but what will matter here is the heat evacuated out of the wl .",
    "this assumption will not affect our conclusions as long as the wl temperature is not so large as to affect its resistance .",
    "we also assume the pads connecting to the wls to be much wider than the length scale over which the temperature relaxes to the bath temperature .    at a given bias current",
    ", we can divide the device into three regions as shown in [ fig : wl]b : 1 ) the narrow wl at a uniform temperature @xmath25 consisting of the rectangular ( width @xmath26 and length @xmath27 ) area in the center and terminating into a semicircle of radius @xmath28 at each end , 2 ) a normal state ( @xmath29 ) semicircular region in each electrode with @xmath30 , and 3 ) a superconducting ( @xmath31 ) region for @xmath32 .",
    "we have assumed a rounded wl of radius @xmath33 to avoid logarithmic divergence in the resistance calculation .",
    "this approach is unlike the hot spot model for a long wl @xcite , where the hot - spot develops near the center of the wl . beyond the wl",
    ", we assume that the heat conducts away radially in the bulk of the film .",
    "thus the temperature also decreases radially inside the two electrodes , reaching the bath temperature @xmath34 far away from the wl .",
    "this enables us to use an effective one - dimensional model for finding the spatial variation of temperature .",
    "the source of heat is the resistive dissipation in the normal region , which extends up to a radial distance @xmath35 in each electrode , thus defining a n - s interface with @xmath19 between normal and superconducting regions .",
    "= 1.8 in    in the resistive state , the joule heat near the wl region is removed in two ways : conduction within each electrode and surface heat flow from film s bottom surface to the substrate .",
    "the latter is assumed to be proportional to the temperature difference between the film and the substrate .",
    "this approximation has been used extensively @xcite ; we will discuss its validity later .",
    "we neglect the heat loss from the top surface of the film as we operate in a vacuum cryostat .",
    "we also assume that the entire substrate stays at the bath temperature @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the general heat flow equation can be written as : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath39 is the thickness of the film , @xmath40 is the area of the wl region given by @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the current .",
    "the surface heat loss coefficient @xmath43 is expressed in w / m@xmath1k .",
    "@xmath44 is the resistance of the electrode within a radius @xmath45 including the resistance of the wl . assuming a radial and isotropic current flow in the electrodes giving rise to circular equipotential lines , the resistance @xmath44 is given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the square resistance of the film , with @xmath48 as the normal state resistivity .",
    "thus @xmath49 defines a characteristic resistance of the film .",
    "the resistance @xmath50 of the wl is given by @xmath51 .",
    "since we consider low temperatures , we ignore the phonon s contribution to the thermal conductivity . in the normal state",
    ", the electronic part of the thermal conductivity @xmath52 can be found using the wiedemann - franz law : @xmath53 , where @xmath52 is the thermal conductivity in the normal state and @xmath54 is the lorentz number . in the superconducting state , as the number of quasi - particles decreases significantly , one expects the thermal conductivity @xmath55 to be much less . at very low temperature , since only very few quasi - particles are left to carry thermal energy , @xmath56 can be exponentially small .",

    "however , since @xmath154 is the ratio of wl resistance @xmath50 to the characteristic resistance @xmath49 of the film , we can effectively increase @xmath154 by increasing the wl resistance .",
    "this can be done by reducing the thickness of the wl alone .",
    "the reduction of the whole film thickness ( @xmath39 ) including the connecting electrodes can also reduce @xmath23 : in this case , @xmath256 is smaller , giving a larger @xmath87 .",

    "if the critical temperature @xmath59 is not affected , a wider temperature span for the hysteresis - free regime is achieved .",
    "this improvement was observed by tinkham et al .",
    "@xcite for superconducting nano - wires . with an appropriate choice of substrate and growth conditions ,",
    "the resistivity and critical temperature of very thin films can remain almost unaffected by thickness reduction ( for nb see ref . ) , enabling similar results to be obtained with continuous films .",
    "another possible way is to reduce the critical current @xmath229 ( and possibly increase @xmath154 ) by either making the wl with a poor superconductor or completely replacing it by a normal metal .",

    "@xcite were able to get a @xmath257 for @xmath0-squids made with sns type weak links based on nb .",

    "we have calculated the detailed i - v characteristics and the temperature profile near the wl as a function of bath temperature .",
    "we have obtained a good agreement between experiments and theory in terms of i - v characteristics and their temperature dependence .",
