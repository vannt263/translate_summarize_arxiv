    "the substrate model on which message communication takes place is shown in fig .  [",

    "this is a regular 2-dimensional lattice with two types of nodes , the regular nodes , connected to their nearest neighbors ( e.g. node @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) ) , and hubs at randomly selected locations which are connected to all nodes in their area of influence , a square of side @xmath4 ( e.g. node @xmath5 in the same figure ) .",
    "we set free boundary conditions .",
    "if a message is routed from a source @xmath6 to a target @xmath7 on this lattice through the baseline mechanism , it takes the path s-1 - 2 - 3-@xmath8 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7-@xmath9 - 8 - 9 - 10-t as in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) .    to set up the gradient mechanism , we need to assign a capacity to each hub ,",
    "the hub capacity being defined to be the number of messages the hub can process simultaneously . here",
    ", each hub is randomly assigned some message capacity between one and @xmath10 .",
    "a gradient flow is assigned from each hub to all the hubs with the maximum capacity ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus , the hubs with lower capacities are connected to the hubs with highest capacity @xmath10 by the gradient mechanism . in fig .  [",
    "fig : model](b ) if hub _",
    "a _ has capacity 5 and hub _ b _ has capacity 10 , then a flow can occur from _ a _ to _ b _ as shown by the dotted line @xmath11 . thus the hubs with the highest capacity @xmath10 are maximally connected by the gradient mechanism .",
    "after the implementation of the gradient mechanism , the distance between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is covered in one step as shown by the link @xmath11 and a message is routed along the path @xmath12a@xmath13g@xmath13b@xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) .",
    "note that gradient mechanism is essentially a one way mechanism ( as shown by @xmath11 ) . the same figure , fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) , also shows the assortative mechanism considered earlier for transport on this network@xcite . here",
    ", each hub is connected assortatively to two other hubs randomly chosen from the other hubs . in the assortative scheme a message is routed along the path s - a - b - c - m-@xmath15-p - d - e - t . the assortative mechanism , unlike the gradient mechanism , can be one way or two way .",
    "we will compare the efficiency of these two schemes for single message and multiple messages transport in later sections of this paper .    [",

    "to summarize , in this paper , we have studied network traffic dynamics for single message and multiple message transport in a communication network of nodes and hubs which incorporates geographic clustering .",
    "the gradient is implemented by assigning each hub on the network some randomly chosen capacity and connecting hubs with lower capacities to the hubs with maximum capacity .",
    "the average travel time of single messages traveling on this lattice , plotted as a function of hub density , shows stretched exponential behavior for the base network in the absence of the gradient , but shows q - exponential behavior with a power - law tail at higher hub densities , if the hubs are connected by the gradient mechanism .",
    "a similar q - exponential distribution with a power - law tail is observed if the hubs are connected by random assortative connections .",
    "the distribution of travel times for the gradient case shows log - normal behavior as in the case of the distribution of latencies for the internet @xcite and for directed traffic flow @xcite .",
    "congestion effects are observed when many messages run simultaneously on the base network .",
    "however , the network decongests very rapidly when the gradient mechanism is applied to a few hubs of high co - efficient of betweenness centrality , the existence of transport traps can set a limit to the extent to which congestion is cleared at low hub density .",
    "the spatial configuration of traps is studied for both the gradient and other assortative decongestion schemes .",
    "we observe that the gradient mechanism which results in the formation of star configurations , is substantially less prone to the formation of transport traps than other decongestion mechanisms .",
    "we also propose strategies which eliminate the trapping effects either by rerouting , or by minimal addition of capacity or connections at very few locations .",
    "these strategies clear the network very efficiently .",
    "we note that networks which incorporate geographic clustering and encounter congestion problems arise in many practical situations e.g. cellular networks@xcite and air traffic networks @xcite .",
    "networks where functional clusters are connected by long range connections arise in complex brain networks@xcite and neural networks@xcite as well .",
    "our results may have relevance in these contexts .",

    "<S> transport processes on networks have been a topic of intensive research in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> examples of transport processes on networks include the traffic of information packets@xcite , transport processes on biological networks @xcite , and road traffic . </S>",
    "<S> the structure and topology of the network , as well as the mechanism of transport , have been seen to play crucial roles in the optimization of the efficiency of the transport process@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to study this interplay in the context of realistic networks so their performance can be optimized . in recent studies </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that transport efficiencies are often driven by local gradients of a scalar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> examples of this include electric current and heat flow which are driven by local gradients of potential and temperature respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the gradient mechanism plays an important role in biological transport processes such as cell migration @xcite , chemotaxis , haptotaxis and galvanotaxis . </S>",
    "<S> there are some lesser known examples of systems where gradient induced transport on complex networks plays an important role . in one example , </S>",
    "<S> the computer ( or a router ) @xcite asks its neighbors on the network for their current packet load . </S>",
    "<S> the router balances its load with the neighbor that has the minimum number of packets to route . in this case , the scalar is the negative of the number of packets that are routed and a directed flow is induced along the gradient of the scalar . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies show that the efficiency of transport of gradient networks depends on the topology of the substrate network . </S>",
    "<S> it has been seen that a gradient network based on a random graph topology tends to get easily congested , in the large network limit . </S>",
    "<S> if the substrate network is scale - free @xcite , then the corresponding gradient network is the least prone to congestion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a congestion driven gradient , as in the router case , has also been studied @xcite .    in this paper , we study the efficiency of the message transport by the gradient mechanism on two dimensional substrate communication network of nodes and hubs . a distance based routing procedure for single messages and for many messages traveling simultaneously in the network are studied in this context . </S>",
    "<S> single message transport had been considered earlier for highway traffic@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both single message and multiple messages traveling simultaneously in the network have been studied n the context of communication networks . </S>",
    "<S> see e.g. @xcite . we observe that multiple messages traveling simultaneously in the lattice lead to trapping effects . </S>",
    "<S> these trapping effects are eliminated by new dynamic strategies .    </S>",
    "<S> communication networks based on two - dimensional lattices have been considered earlier in the context of search algorithms @xcite and of network traffic with routers and hosts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice consists of two types of nodes , the regular or ordinary nodes which are connected to each of its nearest neighbors , and the hubs which are connected to all the nodes in a given area of influence and are randomly disributed in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the network represents a model with local clustering and geographical separations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hubs in the lattice form a random geometry , similar to that of random geometric graphs , @xcite , whereas the ordinary nodes have a regular geometry .    in the absence of the hubs each node has </S>",
    "<S> the same degree of connectivity and the degree distribution is a @xmath1 function with a single peak at four , the number of nearest neighbors . in the presence of hubs </S>",
    "<S> the degree distribution is bimodal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the degree distribution of this network does not belong to the usual classes , namely the small world @xcite or scale free classes of networks , or to that of random graphs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gradient mechanism of message transfer is implemented on this substrate as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the hubs are randomly distributed on the lattice and the message handling capacities of the hubs are chosen out of a random distribution . </S>",
    "<S> connections between hubs are made by the gradient mechanism where the gradient is along the steepest ascent for the capacities associated with the hubs . </S>",
    "<S> the connections between hubs provide short pathways on the lattice , thereby speeding message transfer . in the absence of the gradient mechanism , the average travel time for messages traveling between the source and target on the base network plotted as a function of hub density , showed stretched exponential behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the gradient mechanism is implemented on the lattice , the average travel time for messages shows @xmath2-exponential behavior as a function of hub density . </S>",
    "<S> the tail of the distribution shows power law behavior . </S>",
    "<S> similar @xmath2-exponential behavior is observed if the hubs are connected by random assortative connections , i.e. each hub is connected to two or three randomly chosen other hubs . </S>",
    "<S> the tails of the @xmath2-exponential distribution in both cases show power - law behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the power - law behavior observed earlier at high hub densities for the random assortative connections@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of travel times for the gradient shows log - normal behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the leading behavior of the travel time distribution is also log - normal when the hubs are connected by random assortative connections , but develops an additive power - law correction . </S>",
    "<S> we note that log - normal distributions have been seen for the latency times of the internet@xcite , and in directed traffic flow networks@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , it is interesting to note that travel - time distributions for stationary traffic flow for the webgraph shows power - law behavior , whereas the statnet shows @xmath2-exponential behavior@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we also study the congestion effects which occur when a large number of messages are run simultaneously on the lattice under distance based routing </S>",
    "<S> . such effects , which can be seen in telephone networks , traffic networks , computer networks and the internet @xcite , have immense practical importance @xcite and are an important measure of network efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> various factors like capacity , band - width and network topology @xcite gives rise to congestion and deterioration of the service quality experienced by users due to an increase in network load . </S>",
    "<S> decongestion strategies , which manipulate factors like capacity and connectivity to relieve congestion , have attracted recent attention @xcite . since </S>",
    "<S> the gradient scheme has proved to be quite efficient at relieving congestion in scale free networks @xcite , we test the efficacy of the gradient scheme for decongestion in our two dimensional communication network with the gradient being set up between hubs of high co - efficients of betweenness centrality @xcite , and compare its success with that other assortative schemes . the existence of transport traps has been observed to play a crucial role in congesting transport on scale - free networks @xcite . since our network incorporates geographical information , we study the spatial configuration of traps , the reasons for their formation , and their contribution to the congestion process . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose minimal strategies for the decongestion of traps .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 substrate model , and the gradient mechanism for message transfer is discussed in section i. we also discuss travel time distributions and their finite size scaling when a single message travels on the network at a time , in this section . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii we study the congestion problem , which occurs when many messages travel on the network simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we study the efficiency of a cbc driven gradient with gradient connections between hubs of high cbc , for decongesting the network . in section iii , </S>",
    "<S> we study the spatial distribution of trapping configurations , their contribution to the decongestion process and subsequent elimination of traps by different strategies . in each section </S>",
