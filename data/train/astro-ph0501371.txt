    "in accretion - powered sources , a great deal of theoretical and observational effort is devoted to the study of the inner accretion flow , and to using the accretion flow itself as a tool to study the central compact object .",
    "high frequency qpos in galactic black hole systems may be related to the keplerian frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit ( for zero - spin black holes , @xmath4 ; e.g. , strohmayer 2001 , miller et al .",
    "2001 , remillard et al .",
    "2002 , homan et al .",
    "2004 ) , but they are only observed in a handfull of sources .",
    "qpos at lower frequencies , typically 110 hz are much more common .",
    "although their origin is unclear , interpreting them as a keplerian frequency puts them at @xmath5100 @xmath6 .",
    "if these qpos are a precession frequency at the inner disk ( e.g. , due to frame dragging , see markovic & lamb 1998 ) , they probe regions much closer to the black hole .",
    "broad , asymmetric fe  k@xmath0 emission lines are found in the spectra of both supermassive black holes and stellar - mass galactic black holes ( reynolds & nowak 2003 ) .",
    "these lines appear to be imprinted with the extreme doppler shifts and gravitational red - shifts expected near to a black hole , but the case is not entirely shut .",
    "a natural evolution of the means by which inner accretion flows are studied is to bring spectral and timing constraints to bear jointly .",
    "it has been shown that the disk reflection spectrum ( the fe  k@xmath0 line is the most prominent part of the reflected spectrum ; see george & fabian 1991 ) in galactic black holes varies with broad - band frequency ( gilfanov , churazov , & revnivtsev 2000 ) .",
    "this is strong evidence that timing and spectral properties are intimately related , and supports models wherein fe  k@xmath0 emission lines arise in the inner disk .    in this work ,",
    "we take spectral and timing connections a step further .",
    "we report the discovery of a link between discrete timing features ( qpos ) and spectral features ( fe  k@xmath0 emission lines ) : fe  k@xmath0 emission line strength varies with qpo phase in radio  bright and radio  faint states of the `` microquasar '' grs  1915@xmath1105 .",
    "our results provide the first indication that these diagnostics of the inner accretion flow are related .",
    "we chose to investigate grs  1915@xmath1105 as strong qpos ( see , e.g. , morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ) and fe  k@xmath0 emission lines ( muno et al .",
    "2001 , martocchia et al .",
    "2002 , miller et al .",
    "2004a ) have been reported in this source .",
    "the high mass of grs 1915@xmath1105 ( @xmath7 , harlaftis & greiner 2004 ) means that for a given qpo frequency , the qpos may trace regions closer to the black hole in this source than in lower - mass black holes .",
    "grs  1915@xmath1105 displays a wide variety of radio states .",
    "steady radio emission is associated with compact jets ( fender 2004 ) , and this fact can be exploited to examine whether any relation between fe  k@xmath0 line flux and qpos depends on the presence of a jet .    to extract qpo phase - selected spectra , qpos should be strong enough to dominate the x - ray variability and be directly visible in the x - ray lightcurves .",
    "morgan , remillard , & greiner ( 1997 ) found large amplitude , sinusoidal qpos in grs  1915@xmath1105 that could be seen in the naked lightcurve .",
    "the qpos were found to be quasi  periodic largely due to random jumps in phase .",
    "we selected two observations of grs  1915@xmath1105 available in the _ rxte _ public archive : 20402 - 01 - 15 - 00 ( obs .",

    "1997 ) and 20402 - 01 - 50 - 01 ( obs .",
    "date : 16 oct .",
    "the spectral and timing properties of these observations ( including an fe  k@xmath0 emission line )       have previously been reported on by muno et al .",
    "importantly , muno et al .  ( 2001 ) also studied the radio properties of grs  1915@xmath1105 during these observations ; the first occurred in a `` radio  faint '' state ( hereafter , `` rf '' ; the source was not detected at 8.3 ghz ) , and the second in a radio - bright or radio - plateau state ( @xmath8 mjy at 8.3  ghz ; hereafter `` rb '' ) .",
    "tools within lheasoft version 5.3 and ciao version 3.1 were used to reduce and analyze these observations .",
    "standard _ rxte _",
    "data screening and good time selections were applied ( e.g. , for saa avoidance ) .",
    "we further screened the data to only include times during which all five pcus were operated .",
    "the net total good time for the rf obs .",
    "( 15 - 00 ) was 10.1  ksec , and the net total good time for rb obs .",
    "( 50 - 01 ) was 4.5 ksec .",
    "all spectra and lightcurves were generated using the tool `` saextrct '' , and all response matrices were generated with the tool `` pcarsp '' .",
    "as grs  1915@xmath1105 is very bright and we are interested in relative variations , background spectra were not subtracted .",
    "we made time - averaged broad - band pca spectra by combining data from all layers of all pcus taken in `` standard-2 '' mode ( 129 energy channels between 2 and 60 kev , taken every 16s ) .",
    "spectra and lightcurves were also made from data taken in `` b_8ms_16a_0 - 35_h '' mode ( 16 energy channels up to channel 35  roughly 13 kev  taken every 8ms ) .    to accurately estimate _ relative _ flux differences in data acquired with the same detector",
    ", it is only important to understand the degree to which systematic errors may _ change _ over time . for this purpose , we reduced and analyzed crab spectra obtained before and after each observation of grs  1915@xmath1105 ( spectra obtained on 31 jan.1997 and 16 feb .",
    "1997 , and 12 oct .",
    "1997 and 27 oct .",
    "absorbed power - law fits to these spectra reveal that most channels below 10  kev ( those most important for fe k@xmath0 line studies ) differ by 0.2% or less . to be conservative , we added 0.2% systematic errors to the spectra .",
    "this is less than the 0.51.0% systematic errors often added to pca spectra when absolute fluxes are of interest .",
    "we made power - density spectra ( pds ) of the x - ray flux from each observation using all available data , and fit the       0.01100  hz range with lorentzian functions in the @xmath9max representation ( see , e.g. , homan et al .",
    "each pds is strongly dominated by a single qpo ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the strongest qpo in the rf obs .  has a frequency of 2.273(4 ) hz , a @xmath10value of 6.0(2 ) , and an amplitude of 11.8(2)% rms ( errors are 1@xmath11 ) .",
    "the strongest qpo in the rb obs .  has a frequency of 1.050(3 ) hz , a @xmath10value of 7.9(4 ) , and an amplitude of 11.1(2)% rms . assuming a black hole mass of @xmath12 , if these frequencies are merely keplerian orbital frequencies , they correspond to radii of @xmath2 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "lightcurves from the `` b_8ms_16a_0 - 35_h '' mode data from each observation were analyzed , and the total mean count rate and mean count rate in 100s intervals were calculated .",
    "the mean rate in the rf obs .  is 3532 c / s , with a range of 32983727 c / s when measured in 100s intervals . the mean rate in the rb obs .",
    "is 6602 c / s , with a range of 64966793 c / s .    as the qpos in each observation",
    "dominate the x - ray variability ( see figure 2 ) , and because the mean count rate in each observation is very steady , we applied simple count - rate selections to isolate the maxima and minima of the qpo waves .",
    "for the rf obs . selecting periods when the flux was 15% above or below the mean effectively isolated the maxima and minima .",
    "for the rb obs .",
    "there is less noise apart from the qpo , and periods when the flux was 10% above or below the mean were found to effectively isolate maxima and minima .",
    "the ciao tool `` dmgti '' was used to generate additional good time files of the maxima and minima .",
    "these files were than applied within `` saextrct '' to produce spectra of the maxima and minima .",
    "all spectral analysis was done using xspec version 11.3 ( arnaud 1996 ) and idl version 5.4 .",
    "analysis of the time ",
    "averaged standard-2 spectra was performed in the 3.020.0 kev band .",
    "the pca is calibrated well in this energy range , and this range is not much greater than the range of the `` b_8ms_16a_0 - 35_h '' mode data .",
    "fits to the spectra with a number of common models revealed the fe  k@xmath0 emission line previously noted by muno et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in each case , the addition of a simple       gaussian component to model the line was significant at more than the 8@xmath11 level of confidence .",
    "we find that disk reflection models provide the best overall fit to the broad - band spectrum and do not require a disk that is prominent in the _ rxte _ bandpass .",
    "our model does not include a disk , but this only reflects the fact that a cool disk with moderate flux is not easily seen in the _ rxte _ bandpass , especially when @xmath14 is high .",
    "we fit the time - averaged , high phase , and low phase spectra with absorbed cut - off power - law ( for the radio - bright phase ) or broken power - law ( for the radio - faint phase ) models , modified by the addition of a gaussian component ( to model the fe  k@xmath0 emission line ) and smeared edge component ( `` smedge '' in xspec ) to mimic a reflected continuum .",
    "trudolyubov ( 2001 ) also found that these differing spectral models were required in rf and rb states .",
    "the `` phabs '' model was used to account for absorption in the neutral ism .",
    "the `` smedge '' was not statistically required in all fits , and its parameters could not be well constrained .",
    "however , the smedge effectively mimics a disk reflection spectrum at energies above the fe  k@xmath0 emission line , so we fixed the model parameters to modest values consistent with the data ( @xmath15  kev , @xmath16 , width@xmath17  kev ) .",
    "the parameters obtained from the spectral fits are shown in table 1 . in all cases , the line fluxes and equivalent widths are significantly different in the high and low phase spectra ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the confidence intervals do not overlap even when the 1@xmath11 error bars are multiplied by 5 .",
    "there is evidence that the fe  k@xmath0 emission line flux is broader and slightly shifted to the red in the high phase relative to the low phase .    to demonstrate that the line flux varies in a model ",
    "independent manner , we subtracted the low count rate spectra from the high count rate spectra , and divided the result by the mean count rate for the entirety of each observation . using the energy to channel bounds found in the response matrix for each observation",
    ", the bins in the difference spectra were converted to energy bounds ; however , the detector response was not removed and no spectral fitting was performed . in both the radio  bright and radio  faint observations ,",
    "the most prominent difference between the high and low phases is the fe  k@xmath0 line ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . for a `` control '' observation",
    ", we extracted high and low phase spectra ( 10% above / below the mean ) from a 1.2  ksec slice of an observation of the galactic black hole h  1743@xmath18322 obtained on 28 may 2003 .",
    "like the observations of grs  1915@xmath1105 , h  1743@xmath18322 was highly variable on       timescales of seconds , but had a steady mean count rate on 100  s scales in this window .",
    "spectroscopy of h  1743@xmath18322 in outburst did not reveal an fe  k@xmath0 emission line ( miller et al .",
    "2004b ) , and the fe  k@xmath0 line bins are not globally dominant in the difference spectrum shown in fig .",
    "the main results of this work may be summarized as follows : + @xmath19 fe  k@xmath0 line flux ( and possibly fwhm and centroid energy ) depends on qpo phase in 12  hz qpos in grs  1915@xmath1105 , linking two independent diagnostics of the inner accretion flow .",
    "+ @xmath19 the qpo frequencies at which the fe  k@xmath0 line flux is modulated correspond to radii of @xmath2 and @xmath20 , if they are merely keplerian orbital frequencies .",
    "this link likely ties fe  k@xmath0 lines in galactic black holes to the inner disk and further supports evidence that the observed line broadening is due to dynamics in the disk ( doppler shifts , gravitational red - shifts ) close to the black hole .",
    "+ @xmath19 the presence of fe  k@xmath0 lines , qpos , and the link between them does not depend on jet activity ( taking radio flux as a jet indicator ) .",
    "although the base of a failed jet may be a source of hard x - rays which irradiate the disk , fe  k@xmath0 lines and qpos do not arise in an extended jet .",
    "+ blobs in the inner accretion disk might create qpos and could give a quasi - periodically changing reflector area .",
    "similarly , if the height of hard x - ray emitters ( flares , or the base of a jet ) changes quasi - periodically , qpos and fe  k@xmath0 line variations might be expected . however , while both explanations are possible , such explanations seem inconsistent with the strength and constancy of the qpos found in these observations of grs  1915@xmath1105 , and with the fact that the fe  k  qpo connection holds over a factor of two in flux and in both radio - bright and radio - faint phases . moreover , associating low - frequency qpos with keplerian frequencies is problematic for two reasons : ( 1 ) x - ray production in accretion disks should be centrally concentrated , with little emission from @xmath21 , and ( 2 ) qpos are stronger at higher energies , suggesting they are also centrally produced ( see , e.g. , homan et al .",
    "a stable warp at the inner disk , e.g. due to lense - thirring precession , could cause qpos and would also serve to create a quasi - periodically changing reflector area , modulating the strength of fe  k@xmath0 line emission .",
    "it has been suggested that lense - thirring precession may be the cause of low - frequency qpos in accreting systems ( e.g. , markovic & lamb 1998 ) , and the fe  k  qpo connection may be evidence for this general relativistic effect .    whether or not lense - thirring precession can account for the fe  k  qpo connection , the fe  k  qpo connection has the potential to reveal the innermost regime in accreting systems . for a given disk  driven qpo model , the fe  k  qpo connection gives two measures of radius :",
    "frequencies imply specific radii , and relativistic disk line models constrain radii directly ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 , laor 1991 ) .",
    "the connection over  constrains the system , if qpos are disk frequencies .",
    "work of this kind in galactic black holes may have important implications for fe  k@xmath0 line reverberation mapping in agn with planned missions such as _ constellation - x _ and _ xeus _ ( e.g. , young & reynolds 2000 ) , and observations of disk hot spots orbiting close to the black holes in agn ( e.g. , iwasawa , miniutti , & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "long _ rxte _ exposures with carefully chosen pca modes are needed to obtain additional data for new studies .",
    "the large effective areas of _ xmm - newton _ and _ astro - e2 _ may support such studies as well , and may even allow studies of the line shape with qpo phase . a new x - ray mission with an area of 210m@xmath22 and ccd spectral resolution ( or better ) may fully exploit the fe  k  qpo connection .",
