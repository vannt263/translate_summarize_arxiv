    "nonclassicality describes the difference between classical and quantum physics . for the harmonic oscillator",
    ", its formal definition is based on the coherent states @xmath0 , which are seen as the closest analogues to the classical oscillation  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , any quantum state @xmath1 can be formally written as a statistical mixture of ( classical ) coherent states  @xcite , @xmath2 the function @xmath3 is the so - called glauber sudarshan @xmath4 function , playing the role of the probability density on the set of coherent states .",
    "however , it may violate the requirements for a probability density , such that it has to be considered as a quasiprobability . a state @xmath5 is referred to as classical , if the @xmath4 function still fulfills all properties of a probability density",
    ". otherwise , the state is called nonclassical  @xcite .",
    "however , this definition can not be applied in most practical situations , since the @xmath4 function can only be understood as a generalized function , having singularities of @xmath6-type and worse .",
    "therefore , several derived criteria for nonclassicality have been developed .",
    "on the one hand , one may look at different quasiprobabilities .",
    "for instance , negativities of the wigner function are indicators for nonclassicality of a state  @xcite , but they do not appear for all nonclassical quantum states .",
    "the concept of nonclassicality filters and quasiprobabilities is more powerful , since it provides a simple and complete characterization of nonclassical effects  @xcite .",
    "first experimental demonstrations have been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", one can examine the expectation value of a so - called nonclassicality witness @xmath7 for a given quantum state  @xcite .",
    "if this expectation value is not compatible with expectation values of classical states , then the state must be nonclassical .",
    "this criterion has been used to formulate conditions for matrices of moments  @xcite or conditions for outcome probabilities  @xcite .",
    "recently , the relation between nonclassicality witnesses and quasiprobabilities has been elaborated  @xcite , providing a unified view on all kinds of nonclassicality tests .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that sets of nonclassicality witnesses , which enable one to detect nonclassicality of an arbitrary quantum state , can be parameterized by three real numbers only .",
    "explicit examples for such sets of witnesses have already been given .",
    "in the present work , we show in detail how one can measure the expectation values of these witnesses , by using coherent displacement of a quantum state and subsequent photon - number resolved detection .",
    "the experimental setup is similar to the unbalanced homodyne measurement scheme  @xcite , but adapted for our particular application .",
    "this enables us to determine the expectation values at the quantum - mechanical level of uncertainty  @xcite , which can be used for the significant verification of nonclassical effects .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the construction of complete sets of nonclassicality witnesses .",
    "then , we give the theoretical description of the displacement and measurement in sec .",
    "iii , and discuss the role of statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "iv is dedicated to an illustrative example .",
    "a brief summary and some conclusions are given in sec .",
    "a nonclassicality witness is an operator @xmath7 , whose expectation value is nonnegative for all classical states , @xmath8 clearly , if one examines a state @xmath1 for which the expectation value of @xmath7 is negative , then the state @xmath5 is nonclassical : @xmath9 it has been shown in @xcite that for any nonclassical state @xmath5 , one can verify the nonclassical character by taking a set of nonclassicality witnesses of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the coherent displacement operator , depending on the complex amplitude @xmath12 , and the operator @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 here @xmath15 denotes the normal ordering procedure , and @xmath16 is a real , nonnegative width parameter .",
    "the function @xmath17 can be chosen fixed .",
    "it only has to satisfy some weak properties , namely the fourier transform of @xmath18 shall be a nonclassicality filter fulfilling the conditions as introduced in  @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", this means that @xmath17 is a real continuous function , and the fourier transform of @xmath18 is decaying faster than any gaussian function .",
    "a typical example of a witness operator was derived in  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath19 ^ 2}{4(\\hat a^\\dagger-\\alpha^*)(\\hat a-\\alpha ) } : , \\label{eq : triangular : filter}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the bessel function of first order .",
    "hence , a universal witness applying to any quantum state can even be given in a closed analytical form .",
    "the price we have to pay is that such a witness is based on a nonclassicality filter with compact support .",
    "this means that in general it does not test the complete properties of the quantum state under study for a chosen @xmath16  parameter .",
    "however , by increasing the value of @xmath16 , that test converges to a complete one .    to overcome this problem",
    ", we can choose a witness based on autocorrelation filters  @xcite .",
    "it tests the full state for any choice of @xmath16 , but can be represented only via a numerical integration .",
    "this , however , is not a serious problem since one can store the result of the numerical integration to further apply it for the direct handling of the experimental data .",
    "in the following , we restrict ourselves to a function of the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the photon number operator . in this case",
    ", the set of witnesses   can be written in the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the displaced photon number operator . in  @xcite",
    ", a procedure has been proposed to measure the statistics of such operators .    , the photodiode pd records the photon number statistics with quantum efficiency @xmath25 . the expectation value of the witness @xmath26 can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : reconstruct : p ] ) . ]",
    "let us look at the sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the state of interest is overlapped at a beamsplitter with a coherent state of amplitude @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are the transmissivity and reflectivity of the beamsplitter .",
    "the output state is measured by a photon number resolving detector with quantum efficiency @xmath25 .",
    "it has been shown that the recorded statistics corresponds to the statistics of the operator @xmath29 of the input state @xmath1 , measured with an effective quantum efficiency @xmath30 . therefore , with this setup , we obtain probabilities @xmath31 for observing the @xmath32-th outcome of the measurement of the photon number operator @xmath29 .",
    "now , we can use the witness operator @xmath13 in its spectral decomposition into photon number states @xmath33 , @xmath34 with the matrix elements @xmath35 note that these numbers are independent of the coherent displacement @xmath12 .",
    "all off - diagonal matrix elements are equal to zero , since we assumed that @xmath13 does only depend on the photon number operator .",
    "analogously , we can find the spectral decomposition of the displaced witness as @xmath36 where @xmath37 denote the eigenstates of the displaced photon number operator . now",
    "let us calculate the expectation value of the operator in eq .   with respect to an input state @xmath38 , which suffered detection losses @xmath39 .",
    "the quantity is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is exactly the statistics of the photon number which is measured in the described scheme .",
    "together with the theoretically known coefficients @xmath42 , this equation allows us to estimate the expectation value of the witness .",
    "equation   is a central result of this manuscript , which enables us to look for negative expectation values of any witness @xmath26 .",
    "we emphasize that for verification of nonclassicality , it is sufficient to observe negativity of the expectation value for a single complex amplitude @xmath12 . in this sense , nonclassicality can be tested locally in phase space .",
    "conversely , to demonstrate classicality of a state , one has to examine the witnesses of all complex amplitudes @xmath12 .",
    "a strong point of our method consist in the following . in typical experimental scenarios",
    "one has at least a clear conjecture about the state one is going to produce .",
    "hence on can easily chose the amplitude @xmath12 to be optimal for the state one expects to be created .",
    "when this strategy is successful , the test only requires the optimization of one real parameter @xmath16 .",
    "a failure of the test proves the failure of the conjecture . in such cases",
    "one has still the option to vary the amplitude @xmath12 . in any case",
    ", the test procedure only requires photon - number resolved measurements in order to estimate the witness for an arbitrary amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "we note that our witness test can be replaced by any other nonclassicality criterion , which is necessary and sufficient for photon number distributions .",
    "however , they can be much more elaborate than the calculation of a simple expectation value  @xcite",
    ".    one can minimize the losses introduced by the beamsplitter by choosing a transmissivity close to one . however , theoretically the quantum efficiency is not important for the examination of nonclassicality , since it does not destroy nonclassical effects , but may only decrease the significance of their detection .",
    "more precisely , due to the equivalence of nonclassicality witnesses and quasiprobabilities  @xcite , we can adapt the considerations in  @xcite and find that the quantum efficiency only leads to rescaled parameters @xmath43 of the witness , @xmath44 since it is known that the nonclassical effects become more pronounced with increasing @xmath16 , a lower quantum efficiency may make their significant verification more difficult .",
    "however , as a matter of principle , it does not change the property of a quantum state of being nonclassical or not . therefore , for any positive quantum efficiency it is possible to verify nonclassicality if the number of recorded data points is sufficiently large .      since the photon number probabilities @xmath45 are measured experimentally , they are subject to a statistical uncertainty , stemming from the finite number of measurements . typically , they are calculated from the number of occurrences @xmath46 of a specific photon number @xmath32 , divided by the total number of measurements @xmath47 . since the @xmath46 follow a multinomial distribution , with probabilities @xmath45 for each outcome , their covariance matrix is given by  @xcite @xmath48 consequently , the covariance of the estimated probabilities equals to @xmath49 .",
    "now , the expectation value ( [ eq : reconstruct : p ] ) is a linear function of the photon number probabilities .",
    "therefore , its variance can be exactly estimated as @xmath50 obviously , the evaluation of statistical errors is straightforward and very simple .",
    "moreover , we note that the nonclassicality test is performed on the quantum - mechanical level of uncertainty , since only measurements of a single observable @xmath29 are required  @xcite .      in practice , we can not measure an infinite number of photon number probabilities @xmath51 .",
    "however , we also know that all states with a finite maximum photon number are nonclassical . therefore , it is necessary to estimate the error which arises due to the restriction of the state in fock basis , in order to evaluate if a given state is nonclassical or the observed negativities are only due to the truncation of the fock basis .",
    "let us assume that we can measure the probabilities of the fock states @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , we estimate the expectation value of the witness by @xmath54 the corresponding error therefore is given by @xmath55 for a theoretically known state @xmath1 , it is not difficult to evaluate this quantity",
    ". however , we do not want to use assumptions about the state we examine .",
    "therefore , we have to find a suitable alternative . here , we ask for the maximum of the deviation @xmath56 for all classical states , @xmath57 .",
    "\\label{eq : def : syst : err}\\ ] ] if we can estimate this number , we know that if the state is classical , its expectation value of the nonclassicality witness is bounded from above by @xmath58 if the right side of this equation still shows significant negativities , the state can not be classical , but must be a nonclassical one .",
    "as one can imagine , the calculation of the systematic error is more involved , such that we give the details in the appendix . for practical reasons",
    ", we do not estimate the maximum with respect to all classical states , but restrict ourselves to states for which the probability for counting more than @xmath47 photons is less than some threshold @xmath59 , with @xmath60 being the total probability of all resolved photon numbers .",
    "this restriction is based on the assumption that the recorded data already gives sufficient information on the photon statistics , and the photon counts which can not be resolved by the detector are negligible .",
    "it turns out that the systematic error is independent of the point @xmath12 , therefore we already omitted the argument in @xmath61 .",
    "finally , we show that the maximum can be found as the extremal point of a function of two real parameters , representing amplitudes of coherent states , cf .",
    "eqs .  , .",
    "this makes the calculation feasible for practical applications .",
    "let us consider a single photon added thermal state ( spats )  @xcite with a mean photon number @xmath62 , and a preparation efficiency @xmath63 .",
    "it is known that this state exhibits neither squeezing nor sub - poissonian statistics , arising from eq .",
    "( [ eq_noncl_cond ] ) with @xmath64 and respectively  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these two well - known nonclassicality witnesses are not able to verify nonclassicality of this particular state .",
    "it is also important that under the chosen conditions the wigner function is positive semidefinite  @xcite , and the characteristic function does not show nonclassicality of first order  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is a nontrivial task to witness the nonclassicality of the state under study .",
    "we assume that the quantum efficiency of the detector equals to @xmath65 , leading to an overall efficiency of @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , let us suppose that the detector may resolve the photon number statistics for up to @xmath67 photons .",
    "the initial beam splitter has a transmissivity @xmath68 .",
    "we further assume that we perform @xmath69 measurements per coherent displacement @xmath12 . the probability of finding not more than @xmath70 photons equals to @xmath71 for coherent displacements with @xmath72 . as a nonclassicality witness ,",

    "whenever for the light source under study a properly mode - matched local oscillator ( lo ) is available , the photon number resolution can easily realized by balanced homodyning with a phase randomized lo  @xcite . for the considered example of a spats this method could be implemented  @xcite , so that the required photon number resolution of up to @xmath70 photons is easily realized . for other radiation sources",

    "the applicability of our method has been simulated under realistic conditions for a single - photon added thermal state . for the analyzed quantum state ,",
    "the commonly used nonclassicality criteria fail to identify its nonclassicality .",

    "let us examine the objective function for coherent states @xmath83 : @xmath84 here we already inserted the photon number distribution @xmath45 . obviously , the objective function only depends on the value of @xmath85 .",
