    "<S> these simulations use the `` @xmath1 '' action for staggered quarks , which removes the tree level order @xmath2 discretization errors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> results for scaling of hadron masses , for dynamical quark effects on the static quark potential , and for the light hadron spectrum at @xmath3 fm have been reported in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are continuing these simulations at smaller quark masses and on finer lattices , with @xmath4 fm . </S>",
    "<S> these new runs allow us to extend our studies of the approach to the continuum limit , and to study some new problems such as exotic hybrid mesons with staggered quarks . </S>",
    "<S> several projects based on lattices from these simulations were reported in other talks at this conference@xcite .    before exploring more technical points </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to emphasize that the big picture of hadronic physics coming from lattice simulations is encouraging . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ bigpic_fig ] we show some hadron masses from our three flavor @xmath3 fm calculations compared to experimental results . in this plot the masses ( squared masses for the pseudoscalars ) were simply extrapolated linearly to the physical light quark mass , and no continuum extrapolation was made . here </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 mass was used to set the scale , and the @xmath6 mass to set the light quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> ( we think that the @xmath7 and @xmath8 energies are small because of couplings to two meson states , and we are investigating this further . )    a preliminary indication of the effect of nonzero lattice spacing ( the continuum extrapolation ) is seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mrhonuc_fig ] , where the nucleon and vector meson ( @xmath5 ) masses are plotted in units of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the leading corrections are expected to be proportional to @xmath10 , or about half the size in the 0.09 fm runs as in the 0.13 fm runs . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the corrections are small , but possibly larger in three flavor qcd than in the quenched approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> we have used the static quark potential to fix the lattice spacing in our simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the potential is also useful in phenomenological models of hadrons . in our earlier simulations we showed clear effects of sea quarks on the shape of this potential . with our 0.09 fm runs in progress </S>",
    "<S> , we can begin to investigate the nonzero lattice spacing corrections to this shape . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ potshape_fig ] shows one shape parameter , @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath12 and @xmath9 are defined by @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . ) </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal axis is basically the dynamical quark mass , with the quenched limit at the right and the physical point at 0.033 . </S>",
    "<S> the kink at 0.45 occurs because for quark masses larger than this we varied all three quark masses together , while for light quark masses smaller than this the strange quark mass was held fixed . </S>",
    "<S> the crosses are preliminary 0.09 fm results . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that there is a small upward shift as the lattice spacing is lowered , leading to a very crude estimate of a shift of 0.02 between @xmath0 fm and @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> the relatively small quark masses accessible in simulations with staggered quarks allow us to clearly see the effects of chiral logarithms . as sharpe and shoresh have emphasized@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> partially quenched calculations can be used to determine parameters in the chiral lagrangian that describes the interactions of low energy pions . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ mpisq_pq_fig ] and [ fpi_r1_fig ] show partially quenched pseudoscalar masses and decay constants as a function of valence quark mass for several values of the sea quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> curvature from chiral logarithms is clearly visible , as is the effect of varying the sea quark mass . fitting this data </S>",
    "<S> will require taking into account the effects of the remaining flavor symmetry breaking , as discussed by claude bernard in these proceedings@xcite . </S>"
