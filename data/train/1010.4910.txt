    "in the early 1980 s it was hoped that gauged @xmath0 supergravity would provide a theory of unified gauge interactions that was embedded within a sensible theory of quantum gravity .",
    "this hope went unfulfilled for a number of fundamental reasons relating to the problems of getting a viable vacuum with the appropriate chiral fermions .",
    "one of the issues was that the natural vacuum states all seemed to have planck - scale , negative cosmological constants .",
    "thus @xmath0 supergravity seemed to be an interesting , extremely symmetric but rather rigid and unphysical theory .",
    "the advent of holography changed this state of affairs precisely because gauged @xmath0 supergravity is the field theory of the massless modes in the gravitational background generated by a stack of @xmath9 branes .",
    "the @xmath10 vacua and related solutions could then be reinterpreted in terms of conformal fixed points , perturbed fixed points and flows in the holographically dual field theory on the @xmath9 branes . for the maximally symmetric ( @xmath0 ) vacuum",
    ", there is a precise holographic dictionary that states that the fields of the @xmath0 supergravity are dual to relevant operators in the energy - momentum tensor supermultiplet of the dual gauge theory . in particular",
    ", @xmath0 supergravity contains fields that are dual to fermion and boson bilinears in the @xmath11-brane field theory and so the supergravity theory can be used to study holographic flows that are driven by mass terms and vevs of such bilinears .",
    "more recently , the deeper understanding of the field theory on the @xmath9 brane @xcite enabled the study of the gravity - gauge duality from both sides of the duality .",
    "the interest in gauged @xmath0 supergravity has also grown considerably due to the extensive activity in @xmath12 where the corresponding holographic field theories might be used to study interesting , strongly coupled condensed matter systems in @xmath13 dimensions .",
    "there have been two rather different approaches to the study of @xmath12 : the `` bottom - up '' ( or `` phenomenological '' ) approach and the `` top - down '' approach . in the former ,",
    "the gravity dual of an interesting condensed matter system is postulated _ ab initio _ ( see , for example , @xcite ) , without using the more well - established holographic field theories and their gravity duals . in the latter approach",
    "one tries to realize interesting phenomenological models within theories that have well - established holographic dictionaries , as one does in m - theory or iib supergravity ( see , for example , @xcite--@xcite ) .",
    "it is very important to do this , not only because of the dictionary , but also to make sure that the complete holographic theory does not have other low - mass modes that compromise or destroy the effect that one finds in the reduced or effective field theory .",
    "indeed , there is at least one example of a consistent , even supersymmetric theory with a ( non - supersymmetric ) ground state that is completely stable within that consistent truncation but is pathologically unstable within the complete holographic theory @xcite .",
    "stability of @xmath10 vacua in supergravity has been well understood for many years .",
    "the supergravity potentials are generally unbounded below and do not even have local minima but merely have critical points at negative values of the potential .",
    "the negative values of the potential lead to anti - de sitter ( @xmath10 ) vacua that are expected to be dual to non - trivial conformal fixed points in the field theory .",
    "in such a vacuum one can tolerate a certain amount of negative mass because the gravitational back - reaction can stabilize the fluctuations @xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "suppose that there is a scalar field , @xmath14 , in @xmath15-dimensions with a potential , @xmath16 , that has a critical point at @xmath17 .",
    "taking the lagrangian to be @xmath18 then the @xmath19 vacuum at @xmath17 is stable to quadratic fluctuations if @xcite @xmath20 for more general lagrangians with more scalars and more complicated kinetic terms , one expands quadratically , normalizes to the form of ( [ scallag ] ) and then applies the breitenlohner - freedman ( bf ) bound , ( [ bfcrit ] ) , to the eigenvalues of the quadratic fluctuation matrix for the potential . in the holographically dual field theory ,",
    "violating the bound , ( [ bfcrit ] ) , shows up as a manifest pathology : the holographic dictionary shows that such perturbations are dual to operators with complex conformal dimensions .",
    "supersymmetry guarantees stability through the usual energy bound arguments applied to anti - de sitter space @xcite .",
    "this implies complete classical and semi - classical stability , and not merely to solutions based upon critical points .",
    "supersymmetric flow solutions are therefore completely stable but imposing supersymmetry also significantly restricts the physics .",
    "indeed , in its simplest form , superfluidity and superconductivity require the formation of a fermion condensate and at first sight it seems unclear whether such a condensation alone could be rendered supersymmetric .",
    "it is also not immediately obvious how a fermi - sea would ever develop in a supersymmetric ground state . on the other hand , we know from @xcite that there are holographic flows that have _ sixteen _ supersymmetries and whose infra - red fixed point is described by free fermions and excitations of the fermi sea .",
    "we will show that our new supersymmetric solutions and flows are closely related to these holographic fermion theories and that the new critical point might have the interpretation of a state in this theory .",
    "rather remarkably , the non - supersymmetric @xmath21-invariant critical point discussed in @xcite has not been subjected to a full stability analysis .",
    "this critical point is also part of the @xmath22 truncation of @xmath0 supergravity , where it has an @xmath23 invariance . in this",
    "setting it was discussed in @xcite and was shown to be perturbatively stable within the @xmath22 theory @xcite .",
    "moreover a positive mass theorem was established within the @xmath22 theory @xcite for this critical point and so it was shown to be completely semi - classically stable .",
    "this is not sufficient to guarantee perturbative stability within the full @xmath0 theory because other fields could destabilize the vacuum , as in @xcite , but we will show here that all the scalar fluctuations around this point satisfy the bf bound and so this point is the first known , perturbatively stable , non - supersymmetric @xmath10 vacuum for the @xmath0 theory",
    ". gauged @xmath24 chern - simons model : see formula  @xmath25 in  @xcite . ]",
    "it would be interesting to see if the arguments of @xcite could be extended to the complete @xmath0 theory to establish complete semi - classical stability .    as a result of all these factors it was , and continues to be , very important to classify the solutions of gauged @xmath0 supergravity in four dimensions and , most particularly , find the critical points of the scalar potential of that theory and look at their stability . a systematic analytic method for computing the potential",
    "was developed a long time ago @xcite and was exploited in @xcite to obtain a variety of interesting new supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric vacua .",
    "the limitation of this approach is that analytic computations generally require a fairly high level of symmetry in order for the explicit computations to be possible .",
    "thus , for over 25 years , the only known critical points of the @xmath0 potential had at least @xmath26 or @xmath27 symmetry . on the other hand , a numerical approach to the problem that utilizes sensitivity back - propagation to obtain fast high quality gradients recently has revealed that this potential has many more critical points @xcite with relatively low levels of symmetry .",
    "the fourteen new points discovered in @xcite have at most @xmath2 symmetry and eight of them have no residual continuous symmetry at all .",
    "given this low level of symmetry , it is highly unlikely , and probably impossible for analytic searches to have discovered them .",
    "( indeed , in appendix  [ numlocations ] we give a first glimpse of the difficulty of this problem .",
    ") moreover , even if one knows exactly where these critical points lie , the scalar expectation values are generically so complicated that the @xmath28 matrix has a characteristic polynomial of very high degree and this renders analytic exponentiation computationally out of reach .",
    "one of the important discoveries in @xcite was the possibility of a new @xmath1 supersymmetric critical point with @xmath2 symmetry and with @xmath29 .",
    "this point is potentially very interesting for several reasons .",
    "first , it is a new supersymmetric point .",
    "second , the @xmath2 symmetry commutes with an @xmath30 gauge symmetry and this means that there are a rich collection of possible gauge fields and hence chemical potentials that could induce a flow to this critical point .",
    "moreover , the value of the cosmological constant ( dictated by the value of @xmath31 ) is less than that of all the critical points that have , at least , an @xmath26 invariance @xcite .",
    "the @xmath32-theorem @xcite implies that the cosmological constant must decrease along holographic flows thus interesting , but unstable , flows in @xmath12 , like some of those considered in @xcite , might be arranged to ultimately flow to this new @xmath1 supersymmetric critical point . finally , as we will discuss",
    ", this new supergravity phase may well have an interesting holographic interpretation in terms of a new phase of the fermion droplet model considered in @xcite .",
    "fortunately , since one now knows where to look , this point can be constructed analytically within a consistent truncation of the @xmath33 theory and in this paper we construct this truncation , give an analytic description of the point showing that it does indeed have precisely the symmetries suggested in @xcite .",
    "we also give a superpotential on the truncated sector and obtain the supergravity flow to the new @xmath1 point from the @xmath0 point .    in section [ contrunc ]",
    "we discuss successive consistent truncations of the @xmath0 theory down to a simple @xmath1 theory that we will then analyze in detail .",
    "we include some intermediate @xmath34 and @xmath35 intermediate truncations that not only make the ultimate truncation clearer but should also prove valuable if one wishes to include vector multiplets so as to include holographic chemical potentials . in section [ susyflows ]",
    "we construct the scalar potential and superpotential of this @xmath1 theory and show that the potential has critical points corresponding to the non - supersymmetric @xmath27-invariant point and to the new @xmath1 supersymmetric point found in @xcite .",
    "the superpotential only has the maximally supersymmetric critical point and the @xmath1 supersymmetric critical point .",
    "we also obtain the holographic flow equations for this superpotential and exhibit the @xmath1 supersymmetric flow from the @xmath0 point to the @xmath36 point .",
    "in section [ holft ] we consider the uv asymptotics of the holographic flow and identify the non - normalizable and normalizable fields involved .",
    "it turns out that the only non - normalizable field involved is the one that was extensively studied in @xcite and whose holographic field theory may be described , at least in the infra - red , in terms of free fermions in @xmath37-dimensions .",
    "the flow we consider here is rather more complicated and involves modes that break a lot of symmetry and that were not considered in @xcite , however , these extra modes are _ normalizable _ and this strongly suggests that the flow here might represent some exotic supersymmetric state of the fermion droplet model defined in @xcite .    in section [ masses2 ]",
    "we examine the @xmath27 invariant point in more detail , show that it is stable and discuss possible flows to this point . in section  [ newso3point ] , we discuss the analytic properties of a _ novel _ and different @xmath5 symmetric critical point that is unstable .",
    "in section [ otherpts ] we consider all the other non - supersymmetric critical points and discuss their mass spectrum . out of the eighteen known , non - supersymmetric critical points",
    ", it is only the @xmath27-invariant point with @xmath38 that satisfies the bf bound and is thus perturbatively stable .",
    "we also discuss the prospects of finding more critical points and describe why we believe that there are probably many more critical points with very low levels of symmetry .",
    "we also describe why such points are almost certainly outside the reach of analytic algorithms but are likely to be accessible using numerical searches",
    ". finally , in section [ concs ] , we make some remarks about the broader implications of our work .",
    "to examine the new supersymmetric point , we will describe it as part of an @xmath1 supersymmetric truncation of the @xmath0 theory .",
    "we will , however , arrive at this @xmath1 truncation successively by reducing to sectors that are invariant under progressively more symmetry .",
    "indeed , we will first pass to an @xmath34 theory and then show that the @xmath1 theory lies in the common overlap of two different @xmath35 theories .",
    "we anticipate that these intermediate @xmath35 truncations will be useful when one wishes to study more general supergravity flows that involve vector fields and induce chemical potentials in the holographic field theory .      since the critical point we seek is invariant under under the two rotations , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , that generate an @xmath41 subgroup of @xmath42 @xcite , the obvious first step is to consider the sector of the entire @xmath0 theory that is invariant under this symmetry .",
    "these rotations preserve four supersymmetries , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and so the result must be @xmath34 supersymmetric . indeed it is @xmath34 supergravity coupled to two @xmath34 vector multiplets : the six vector fields in the graviton multiplet are @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the two vector multiplets are generated by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    to isolate the scalar manifold , consider the @xmath49 subgroup of @xmath42 where @xmath50 acts on indices @xmath51 and @xmath52 acts on indices @xmath53 . inside @xmath28",
    ", @xmath52 commutes with @xmath54 where the @xmath55 acts on the @xmath51 and the non - compact generators of the @xmath56 can be represented by the self - dual form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a complex number .",
    "this @xmath56 defines the complex scalar of the @xmath34 graviton supermultiplet .",
    "the commutant of the @xmath41 generated by @xmath39 and @xmath59 in @xmath28 is simply @xmath60 where @xmath61 is embedded in the obvious manner .",
    "the non - compact generators of the @xmath62 can be represented by the self - dual forms : @xmath63 this defines the twelve scalars in the two @xmath34 vector multiplets .",
    "one can now use some discrete subgroups of @xmath42 : @xmath64 with the remaining @xmath65 invariant . note that these transformations have determinant one and so",
    "live in @xmath42 .",
    "more importantly , these discrete symmetries leave invariant the scalars that define the new @xmath1 critical point .",
    "the two intermediate @xmath35 theories are defined by requiring invariance under either @xmath66 or @xmath67 separately .",
    "invariance under @xmath66 leaves the two supersymmetries , @xmath68 and @xmath44 and only two vector fields : @xmath69 and @xmath70 . from the supersymmetries",
    "it is evident that @xmath69 must lie in the @xmath35 graviton multiplet while @xmath70 must generate an @xmath35 vector multiplet .",
    "the scalars in the @xmath56 defined by ( [ sl2a ] ) belong to this vector multiplet .",
    "the remaining fields then make up two @xmath35 hypermultiplets and these contain the four complex @xmath66-invariant scalars in ( [ liescalars ] ) parametrized by @xmath71 and @xmath72 in ( [ liescalars ] ) . thus the complete scalar manifold can be described in terms of the coset : @xmath73 invariance under @xmath67 leaves the two supersymmetries , @xmath74 and @xmath75 and three vector fields : @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . from the supersymmetries",
    "it is evident that @xmath79 must lie in the graviton multiplet while @xmath80 and @xmath81 generate two @xmath35 vector multiplets .",
    "again , the scalars in the @xmath56 defined by ( [ sl2a ] ) belong to one of these vector multiplets",
    ". there are three complex @xmath67-invariant scalars that arise from ( [ liescalars ] ) by taking @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 . one of these belongs to a vector multiplet while the remainder constitute an @xmath35 hypermultiplet .",
    "thus the complete scalar manifold can be described in terms of the coset : @xmath85      requiring invariance under both @xmath66 and @xmath67 leaves only one supersymmetry , @xmath75 , and projects out all the vector fields .",
    "the @xmath56 of the @xmath34 graviton multiplet survives while , in ( [ liescalars ] ) , one must set @xmath86 and @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this reduces @xmath62 to @xmath89 and so the scalar coset is now : @xmath90 these simply form three @xmath1 scalar multiplets with the @xmath66-invariant and @xmath67-invariant fermions : @xmath91 we are thus dealing with @xmath1 supergravity coupled to three scalar multiplets .",

    "there are two important aspects to this issue .",
    "first , the numerical method uses the sensitivity back - propagation method to minimize @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the tensor self - duality condition that defines a critical point @xcite .",
    "the algorithm starts from a choice of a random point but even so , it provides a remarkably efficient strategy to numerically obtain a lot of useful information about previously unknown stationary points which may then be utilized as an input to a fully analytic investigation .",
    "however , the size of the basin of attraction seems to vary strongly between different stationary points .",
    "numerical searches can have four different outcomes : ( a ) the calculation fails due to a numerical overflow , ( b ) the calculation ` gets stuck ' as optimization proceeds extremely slowly , ( c ) the calculation produces a stationary point which already was found earlier , and ( d ) the calculation produces a novel solution . with some code tweaking , ( a )",
    "can be avoided almost completely , ( b ) happens rarely , but quite typically in the neighborhood of some ` tricky ' critical points ( the @xmath1 vacuum with @xmath260 being one of them ) , ( c ) is fairly frequent but with a very uneven distribution of results , and ( d ) happens sufficiently often to assume that the total number of solutions is far larger than those described so far .",
    "the second aspect is that typical violations of the stationarity condition , measured by @xmath258 , get larger the further one moves outward from the @xmath0 vacuum on the scalar manifold .",
    "hence , gradients naturally tend to draw the numerical optimization towards the @xmath0 point . in order to counteract this ,",
    "the numerical search strategy which was developed in  @xcite for @xmath24 theory in three dimensions and also employed to find the fourteen new solutions comes with a ` tweaking parameter ' that essentially allows some control over the distance from the @xmath0 point at which optimization will tend to spend most time . in  @xcite , this parameter was chosen to scan at a distance somewhat beyond the @xmath26-invariant critical points . due to the existence of this tweaking parameter , all claims about",
    "how generic the solutions thus found by this approach must be qualified with a statement about the search range .    while a far more detailed analysis of the scalar potentials of all ( highly extended ) supergravity models",
    "is now possible compared to what would have been considered as feasible some years ago , there also are some indications ( considering results for the @xmath24 theory in three dimensions @xcite ) that hardware - supported ieee-754 floating point numbers might be insufficient to find and analyze solutions that lie ` very far out ' . apart from this ,",
    "high - precision numerics also is important for semi - automatically producing analytic conjectures from numerical data , as explained in  @xcite .",
    "this will be explored in more detail in the next sub - sections .",
    "one generally would expect that analytic expressions for the locations and properties of critical points get ever more complicated the more the @xmath42 gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , the large number of solutions suggests using semi - automatic heuristics to obtain analytic expressions from numerical data .",
    "we will now illustrate this approach by proposing some analytic results for critical point # 9 in the list presented in  @xcite .",
    "this solution has residual @xmath261 gauge symmetry but as we will see , the analytic form of the solution is very complicated .",
    "we then discuss critical point # 8 , which has _ no _ residual continuous symmetry , and argue that it is , at present , completely out of reach of analytic methods .      using the sensitivity back - propagation method with enhanced numerical precision",
    "allows the determination of the cosmological constant of critical point  # 9 to high accuracy with reasonable computational effort . to 100  digits , this is : @xmath262 employing the pslq algorithm  @xcite to find integer relations between integer powers of @xmath263 , one finds that about 80 digits of the cosmological constant suffice to automatically derive the conjecture that @xmath264 is a zero of the polynomial @xmath265    specifically , if we define : @xmath266 then we find : @xmath267 it is also interesting to note that there is no natural number @xmath268 for which @xmath269 .",
    "this exact expression then manages to ` predict ' the next 20 digits correctly and hence very likely is the correct one .",
    "the complexity of the analytic expression shown here has to be seen in contrast to those that give the cosmological constant for the long - known critical points # 1  # 7 : there , the fourth power of @xmath270 always is a fairly manageable rational number .",
    "given that @xmath263 is a zero of a @xmath271 order polynomial with coefficients of magnitude @xmath272 , one may optimistically hope that a reasonable number of digits of accuracy should suffice to automatically determine similar analytic conjectures for the entries of the @xmath28 @xmath273bein  @xmath274 .",
    "however , as table ( a.1 ) in  @xcite shows , the coordinates of stationary points generally can be expected to be algebraically somewhat more complicated than their cosmological constants , and this seems to hold as well for the entries of the @xmath275-bein .",
    "so far , 150 digits of accuracy turned out to be insufficient to obtain any analytic conjectures for this critical point by applying the pslq algorithm . still ,",

    "the same claims also hold for other stationary points and for models in other dimensions , however , taking the logarithm of  @xmath274 and also establishing that  @xmath274 is indeed an element of the corresponding exceptional group may sometimes be somewhat tricky ( especially in three dimensions ) . for critical point",
    "# 9 , the @xmath275-bein  @xmath274 contains ( in its real and imaginary part ) 92 different irrational numbers for which analytic expressions yet have to be found .",
    "nevertheless , the observation that the stationarity condition could be satisfied to more than  @xmath277 digits leaves little room for doubt about the existence of this particular solution .",
    "precision data on the location of solution # 9 are listed in appendix  [ numlocations ] .",
    "the hybrid analytic / numerical heuristics based on the pslq algorithm can be applied to all the other critical points but , at present , this algorithm does not appear to be strong enough to obtain any analytic conjecture for properties of the least symmetric points .",
    "for example , at critical point # 8 in @xcite the gauge group is broken completely and this point illustrates the magnitude of the analytic challenge .    among those critical points without residual symmetry",
    ", one would naturally expect the one with smallest @xmath270 to have the simplest analytic expressions .",
    "the value of the cosmological constant ( accurate to 300 digits ) is : @xmath278    this information should be sufficient to obtain a useful analytic conjecture for  @xmath279 if it is the zero of a polynomial with integer coefficients such that @xmath280 so far , we have not managed to obtain such an expression , indicating that the complexity of the corresponding polynomial is beyond reach even of this level of accuracy .",
    "we give precision data on the location of critical point  @xmath281 to 150 digits in appendix  [ numlocations ] and leave it as a challenge to our readers to obtain an analytic result .",
    "this investigation shows that , in all likelihood , analytic expressions for further critical points ( which are very likely to exist ) with no or very little residual symmetry and large  @xmath282 probably are too complicated to be handled conveniently .",
    "hence , using numerical methods may well be the dominant strategy to obtain information about the properties of most as yet unknown critical points .",
    "it is evident that , even many years after its construction , the potential of gauged @xmath0 supergravity in four dimensions still has the capacity to surprise us with new challenges and potentially physically important solutions .    in this paper",
    "we have not only analytically exhibited a new , @xmath1 supersymmetric critical point but we have embedded it in a consistent truncation to an @xmath1 supersymmetric field theory .",
    "we have given the complete superpotential for this theory and have derived the supersymmetric flow equations and used them to construct the flow from the @xmath0 supersymmetric critical point to the new @xmath1 point .",
    "the holographic interpretation of this flow is potentially very interesting because it appears to correspond to a new superconformal state in a broad class of flows whose original infra - red limit corresponds to a free fermion model @xcite .",
    "we have also done some analysis of the new families of solutions that have been found numerically @xcite .",
    "in addition to the discovery of the new @xmath1 supersymmetric point , the numerical search also revealed thirteen new non - supersymmetric critical points .",
    "unfortunately , all of these new points have scalar excitations that violate the bf bound and so are unstable .",
    "on the other hand , our complete stability analysis revealed that the @xmath27-invariant critical point , found long ago , is perturbatively stable .",
    "it is also a critical point that lies in the truncation to the @xmath1 supergravity theory and so it is easily analyzed from within a simple and very interesting supergravity theory .",
    "it is also intriguing to note that this @xmath1 supergravity has the somewhat unusual property that its potential has several critical points and _ all _ of them are stable !",
    "this could possibly be related to its interesting holographic dual .",
    "one of the other things that is clear from the numerical analysis is that there are probably a lot more critical points in the supergravity potential .",
    "moreover , a lot of them have little , or no , residual symmetry .",
    "we have demonstrated how such critical points with low levels of symmetry are going to be very hard , if not impossible , to access analytically . on the other hand ,",
    "the best strategy is probably the one exemplified by this paper : use the numerical algorithms to find the interesting , stable points and then , once one knows where to look , bring the full force of analytic methods to bear on the new solutions .",
    "as regards the future , there is evidently a lot of new critical points to be discovered and one should also look in the five - dimensional maximal supergravity theories as well . from the point of view of @xmath12 , there are also a number of interesting new things to be done .    first ,",
    "as we pointed out in section [ contrunc ] , the @xmath1 supergravity that contains the new , @xmath1 supersymmetric critical point can itself be embedded in slightly larger @xmath35 supergravity theories that contain some vector potentials .",
    "these vector potentials can be used to induce chemical potentials in the theory on the brane and so drive interesting flows to the critical points of the theory , particularly given the stability of all the critical points in the @xmath1 theory",
    ". this would be especially interesting given the well - known holographic interpretation of the massive flows within this model .",
    "it is also important to point out that the massive flows with sixteen supersymmetries in gauged supergravity studied in @xcite represented an extremely simple `` tip of an iceberg '' when the corresponding flows were studied in much greater generality in m - theory and iib supergravity @xcite . since the flows studied here differ from the flows of @xcite by adding perturbations by normalizable modes , it is reasonable to expect that something similar might occur in the far more general flows constructed in @xcite .",
