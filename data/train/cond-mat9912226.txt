    "a stripe is a complicated object .",
    "its degrees of freedom may include charge and spin of the stripe particles , as well as transverse fluctuations of its position .",
    "one potentially promising route to finding the right 1d model is to study simple solvable models of an antiferromagnet in 2d in the presence of a domain wall .",
    "a single domain wall can be created artificially , e.g. , by wrapping a system with an odd number of rows on a cylinder .",
    "one may then study an isolated stripe at any filling @xmath4 by adding or removing the right number of electrons .",
    "a 2d model may look unrealistic , but with universality and a bit of luck the resulting 1d theory may have just the right symmetry of the vacuum and the correct quantum numbers of elementary excitations .",
    "consider a 2d model , a variant of the @xmath0@xmath1 model in the ising limit @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath6,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the usual exclusion of doubly occupied sites .",
    "the dominating @xmath7 term minimizes the number of frustrated ( ferromagnetic ) bonds and thus sets the ground state .",
    "the energy of an af bond @xmath8 controls interactions of charged quasiparticles on the domain wall and in the bulk . making @xmath9 prevents phase separation in the bulk , as well as on a stripe .          for @xmath13 , the stripe will contain @xmath14 quasiparticles with the quantum numbers of electrons , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : electron ] ) .",
    "because of the zigzag geometry of the stripe , the electron quasiparticles feel a strong ( of order @xmath7 ) staggered magnetic field .",
    "it confines electrons with opposite spins to different rows of the stripe . within its row ,",
    "an electron can delocalize to reduce kinetic energy . in the tight - binding model ( [ t - j - ham ] ) , such hopping is a multistage process , which involves pushing a neighbor spin out of the way .          precisely at half - filling ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "the domain wall is bond - centered .",
    "a single doped hole ends up at the domain wall ( fig .",
    "[ fig : holon ] , left ) .",
    "if it starts to move alng the wall , two remarkable things happen .",
    "first , the hole leaves its spin @xmath18 behind in the form of a spinon and then propagates freely as a spinless object ( a holon , fig .",
    "[ fig : holon ] , right ) .",
    "no additional frustrated bonds are produced afterwards .",
    "furthermore , no costly spinons would be left behind had we started with 2 holes .",
    "second , the holon ( as well as the spinon ) resides on a transverse kink of the domain wall .",
    "these elementary excitations are thus maximally strongly coupled to transverse fluctuations of the stripe .",
    "kink direction can be specified by assigning a holon ( or a spinon ) a transverse flavor @xmath19 @xcite ."

    "<S> we argue that effective 1d models of stripes in the cuprate superconductors can be constructed by studying ground states and elementary excitations of domain walls in 2d model antiferromagnets . </S>",

    "<S> some progress has been made . </S>",
    "<S> hartree - fock studies of the hubbard model near half - filling @xcite have revealed that doped charges segregate in the form of narrow stripes . </S>",
    "<S> the stripes are domain walls separating antiferromagnetic ( af ) domains with opposite orientations of the neel vector , in agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> however , the predicted linear density of charge on a stripe , @xmath2 hole per unit cell , indicates that there are no charges able to carry current . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , @xmath3 for non - overlapping stripes @xcite .    in the absence of a microscopic theory , it is reasonable to look for a model description in which a stripe is a 1d object interacting with the surrounding antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> a stripe is characterized by a ground state , by its elementary excitations , and by the interactions of the excitations among themselves and with the environment . </S>"
