    "forecast of various time series has been widely using in many fields of science and practice and many methods have been advanced for prediction of time series .",
    "but common problem of each method is a priori estimate of its accuracy .",
    "common practice is to take a truncated series ( reference series ) ended in the past , investigate its statistical parameters , build prediction and compare it with existing continuation of series under investigation .",
    "using moving shift of reference series one can collect needed statistics and obtain estimate of accuracy of used method depending on length of prediction .",
    "after that obtained accuracy is assigned to real predictions .    in most of predicted time series last observed point ( epoch ) preceding the first predicted one has its final value and is not subject of refinement in future ( e.g. , number of sunspots for some epoch ) .",
    "it is not the case for eop .",
    "all real eop predictions are based on operational solution that may differ substantially from final eop values that comes usually in one - two months .    as an illustration of the foregoing ,",
    "let s consider fig .  1 . in this figure @xmath0  the epoch of beginning of prediction , @xmath1   operational eop series used for computation of prediction , @xmath2   prediction computed in real time ( at date @xmath0 ) , @xmath3   final eop series , @xmath4   prediction that would be computed from the final series if it were available at date @xmath0",
    ". upon this circumstance , accuracy and other statistical parameters of operational eop series may differ substantially from ones for final series that are commonly used for a priori estimate of prediction accuracy .",
    "it means that estimates of prediction accuracy obtained by `` standard '' method may be far from reality and some its modification ( or at least investigation ) is desirable .",
    "evidently , the most simple way to make a priory estimate of accuracy of prediction is a fictive disturbances of one or more last points of reference interval to investigate reaction of given method of prediction on errors at the last observed epoch(s ) .",
    "this test was realized in ( malkin & skurikhina 1996 ) .",
    "two kind of fictive errors was applied to real observed points :    _ test 1 _ :",
    "the value of 1 mas was added to ( or subtract from ) the c04 value corresponding to the last observed epoch .    _",
    "test 2 _ :  the values of 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 mas were added to ( or subtract from ) the c04 value corresponding to the three last observed epoch .",
    "this test was used only for arima method because its influence on the extrapolation of trend - harmonics model ( e.g. , mccarthy & luzum 1991 ) can be easily foreseen without special calculations .",
    "typical differences between predictions of real and distorted c04 series are presented in table  [ tab : pred_xy_dist ] .",
    "one can see that serious degradation of accuracy may occur when arima method is used for erroneous observed eop values .",
    "it should be mentioned that this effect practically linearly depends on the value of error .",
    "analogous results were obtained for prediction of ut ( malkin & skurikhina 1996 ) .",
    ".influence of errors in the last values on prediction results .",

    "in this paper we have attempted to estimate real accuracy of predictions of eop using real - time predictions made at the iaa and the usno has been also made .",
    "although collected statistics is too poor to make more or less final conclusions , we can state that :    * estimate of accuracy of prediction based on use of old data is not adequate to accuracy of real - time prediction , especially for short - time prediction .",
    "a modification of commonly used method of a priori estimate of accuracy , e.g. , proposed in ( malkin & skurikhina 1996 ) can give more realistic estimates .",
    "* accuracy of methods of prediction of eop used at the iaa and the usno is approximately the same .",
    "more detailed conclusion can be made only after collecting supplement statistics .",
    "* estimate of both rms and maximal errors in prediction is very useful for potential users .",
    "it seems reasonable to provide such estimates for iers and other prediction series ."
