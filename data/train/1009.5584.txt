    "the large - scale , ordered nature of magnetic fields detected at the surface of some ap , o and b type stars and the scaling of their strengths ( according to the flux conservation scenario ) favour a fossil hypothesis , whose origin is not yet elucidated . to have survived since the stellar formation",
    ", a field must be stable on a dynamic ( alfvn ) timescale .",
    "it was suggested by prendergast ( 1956 ) that a stellar magnetic field in stable axisymmetric equilibrium must contain both poloidal ( meridional ) and toroidal ( azimuthal ) components , since both are unstable on their own ( tayler 1973 ; wright 1973 ) .",
    "this was confirmed recently by numerical simulations ( braithwaite & spruit 2004 ; braithwaite & nordlund 2006 ) showing that an arbitrary initial field evolves on an alfvn timescale into a stable configuration ; axisymmetric mixed poloidal - toroidal fields were found . on the other hand ,",
    "magnetic equilibria models displaying similar properties have been re - examined analytically by duez & mathis ( 2010 ) .",
    "we here address the question of their stability .",
    "we deal with non force - free magnetic configurations ( _ i.e. _ with a non - zero lorentz force ) in equilibrium inside a conductive fluid in absence of convection .",
    "several reasons inclined us to focus on non force - free equilibria .",
    "first , reisenegger ( 2009 ) reminds us that no configuration can be force - free everywhere .",
    "although there do exist `` force - free '' configurations , they must be confined by some region or boundary layer with non - zero or singular lorentz force .",
    "second , non force - free equilibria have been identified in plasma physics as the result of relaxation ( self - organization process involving magnetic reconnections in resistive mhd ) , _",
    "e.g. _ by montgomery & phillips ( 1988 ) .",
    "third , as shown by duez & mathis ( 2010 ) , this family of equilibria is a generalization of taylor states ( force - free relaxed equilibria ; see taylor 1974 ) in a stellar context , where the stratification of the medium plays a crucial role .",
    "the equilibrium obtained is described in detail in duez & mathis ( 2010 ) as the lowest energy configuration conserving the invariants of the problem ( during the relaxation phase ) which are the magnetic helicity ( preventing the rapid energy decay ) and the mass enclosed in magnetic poloidal flux surfaces ( to account for the non force - free property ) .",
    "we use the stagger code ( nordlund & galsgaard 1995 ) .",
    "we model the star as a self - gravitating ball of ideal gas @xmath0 with radial density and pressure profiles initially obeying the polytropic relation @xmath1 , with index n = 3 , therefore stably stratified .",
    "more details on the numerical model setup can be found in braithwaite & nordlund 2006 .",
    "the configuration is then submitted to white perturbations ( @xmath2 in density ) . the dynamical evolution of the mixed configuration is compared to its purely poloidal and its purely toroidal components , whose behaviour are well known to be unstable due to kink - type instabilities .",
    "the magnetic and velocity amplitudes are plotted on fig . 1 .",
    "as we can see , in contrast to these unstable configurations , the mixed poloidal - toroidal one does not exhibit any sign of instability , even for high azimuthal wavenumbers ( up to about 40 ) .",
    "this is the first time the stability of an analytically - derived stellar magnetic equilibrium has been confirmed numerically .",
    "this result has strong astrophysical implications : the confuiguration provides a good initial condition to magnetohydrodynamic simulations and magneto - rotational transport to be included in next generation stellar evolution codes ; furthermore it could help to appreciate the internal magnetic structure of neutron stars and magnetic white dwarfs ."
