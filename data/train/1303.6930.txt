    "we claim that the density of the hyperbolic metric of @xmath56 on @xmath52 is bounded above and below in terms of @xmath53 . indeed , the hyperbolic length of @xmath52 is a function of @xmath53 so we get such a bound by applying the koebe distortion theorem to a single - valued lift of @xmath61 to the universal cover of @xmath56 .",
    "it follows that @xmath62 is bi - lipschitz , with constants that depend only on @xmath53 .",

    "we can construct an example of this _ cavitation _ behavior as follows . consider a subdomain @xmath196 of @xmath197 obtained by removing countably many complex conjugate pairs of circular arcs , where one arc of the @xmath198 pair is @xmath199 the domain @xmath200 is conformally equivalent via a conformal map that fixes @xmath201 to a slit domain @xmath202 , which may be obtained from @xmath203 by removing finitely many pairs of intervals @xmath204",
    ", @xmath205 contained in the imaginary axis , arranged symmetrically about @xmath29 , together with an interval @xmath206 .",
    "see figure  [ f : cavitation ] for a schematic illustration",
    ". one can show that if the angles @xmath207 are chosen to decrease to @xmath29 sufficiently fast then the domains @xmath202 converge in the carathodory topology to a limit domain @xmath1 in which @xmath29 is a non - isolated singleton complementary component , but every other complementary component is an isolated interval of the imaginary axis .",
    "then @xmath196 is conformally equivalent to @xmath1 and we have an example of cavitation : the singleton complementary component @xmath208 of @xmath1 corresponds to the complementary component @xmath209 of @xmath196 .",
    "the idea is that by making @xmath207 small we can ensure that the extremal length of the family of curves in @xmath196 joining @xmath210 to @xmath211 is as small as we like .",
    "this means we can make the gap between the intervals @xmath204 and @xmath205 as short as we like in comparison to the length of @xmath204 .",
    "in fact to ensure that the end represented in @xmath196 by the unit circle is represented in @xmath1 by a singleton , it suffices to take @xmath212 .",
    "we will now prove lemma  [ l : no cavitation ] , which says that uniform separation prevents cavitation .",
    "suppose each non - singleton connected component @xmath12 of @xmath213 is separated from the remaining complementary components by a ring domain @xmath214 of modulus @xmath194 .",

    "the length of @xmath215 with respect to the hyperbolic metric of @xmath0 is also at most @xmath216 .",
    "consider the simple closed geodesic @xmath217 ( with respect to the hyperbolic metric of @xmath0 ) that lies in the free homotopy class of @xmath215 . since @xmath217 is a length minimizer in its free homotopy class , it is no longer than @xmath215 in the hyperbolic metric of @xmath0 .",

    "our reason for passing from the ring domains @xmath40 to the ring domains @xmath218 is that the closures of the @xmath218 in @xmath108 are pairwise disjoint , which was not necessarily true of the @xmath40 , and moreover the @xmath218 are intrinsically - defined subdomains of @xmath0 .",

    "the rest of this paper concerns the practical numerical approximation of finitely - connected intrinsic circle domains in the sphere .",
    "the idea is roughly to follow the steps of the existence proof , performing each step numerically .",

    "finitely connected circle domains can be approximated using iterated riemann mapping , the individual steps of which can be carried out using a number of different methods for computational conformal mapping . however , we must deal with an infinitely connected circle domain , so it seems at first sight that we must make decisions about which complementary components to ignore at any particular stage of the approximation .",
    "we will see that this truncation can in fact be avoided .",
    "secondly , if we follow the existence proof directly , it seems that we need to compute a quasiconformal extension numerically , find its dilatation and then solve a beltrami equation on a larger domain . in practice ,",
    "these steps can be combined into a single _ conformal welding _ step .",
    "fortunately , circle packing is a numerical approximation method that offers solutions to all of these challenges .",
    "although circle packing is not often used for high - precision conformal mapping problems on account of its relatively slow convergence , it is particularly well suited to the approximation of circle domains , especially those with fuchsian symmetry .",
    "it is also a practical tool for numerical conformal welding .",
    "we were able to carry out all of the steps of an approximation procedure for computing intrinsic circle domains using the ` circlepack ` software @xcite written by ken stephenson et al .",
    "for an introduction to circle packing and its use as a computational tool , we refer the reader to stephenson s monograph  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath264 be a finite graph embedded in the plane .",
    "a circle packing of @xmath264 in the plane is a collection @xmath265 of circular discs @xmath266 with disjoint interiors , one corresponding to each vertex @xmath267 of @xmath264 , such that whenever vertices @xmath267 and @xmath268 are adjacent in @xmath264 the discs @xmath266 and @xmath269 are tangent .",
    "we call @xmath264 the _ nerve _ of @xmath265",
    ". we may also circle pack in the sphere , using discs in the spherical metric , or in the hyperbolic plane , using hyperbolic circles and possibly also horocircles on the boundary .",
    "the _ carrier _ of @xmath265 is the geometric complex formed by connecting the centers of neighboring circles by geodesic segments . according to the koebe - andreev - thurston theorem ,",
    "when @xmath264 is any triangulation of the sphere , there exists a circle packing of @xmath264 , and it is unique up to mbius maps and reflection . in this case , the carrier of @xmath265 is the entire sphere . since we want to use circle packings to approximate conformal structures , we remove the reflection ambiguity by imposing a fixed orientation .",
    "there is a beautiful algorithm due to bill thurston for computing a circle packing from a given nerve .",
    "it works by removing one vertex and packing the remaining triangulation into the unit disc .",
    "this is achieved by computing the _ hyperbolic packing label _ for the packing ; this is the function which assigns a hyperbolic radius to each vertex of the triangulation , in such a way that the boundary circles are given infinite radius , so that they correspond to horocircles , internally tangent to the unit circle , and all interior circles have finite hyperbolic radius .",
    "there is a unique packing label that results in an angle sum of @xmath270 at each interior vertex .",
    "algorithm approximates the correct label as the limit of a pointwise increasing sequence of labels .",
    "once the correct packing label is known , the circles of the given radii can be laid out in the hyperbolic plane iteratively so that each satisfies the appropriate tangency conditions .      here",
    "we outline a numerical method for approximating intrinsic circle domains .",
    "let @xmath0 be a given finitely connected domain in the riemann sphere . begin by taking a circle packing @xmath265 such that the interiors of all the circles of @xmath265 are contained in @xmath0 and the complementary components of @xmath0 are separated by the carrier of @xmath265 .",
    "all subsequent calculations depend only on the nerve of @xmath265 , so it is in this step that we have captured a discrete approximation to the conformal equivalence class of @xmath0 .",

    "we perform a sequence of circle packing computations in order to construct a triangulation of the sphere together with an embedding of the nerve of @xmath265 as a subcomplex .",
    "when we compute the circle packing @xmath272 of the spherical triangulation , the carrier of the embedded sub - packing gives an approximation to the intrinsic circle domain @xmath0 conformally equivalent to @xmath273 .",
    "we can interpolate the mapping of circle centers of @xmath265 to the corresponding circle centers in @xmath272 to give a _ polyhedral _ embedding of the carrier of @xmath265 into the carrier of @xmath272 .",
    "since we are mapping from the plane to the sphere , we can not map in a piecewise affine fashion , so instead we map in a piecewise affine fashion to the polyhedron in @xmath274 whose vertices are the vertices of @xmath272 in @xmath275 , and then project radially outwards to @xmath275 .",
    "this map gives a homeomorphism which approximates the conformal map from @xmath273 to @xmath0 and is locally quasiconformal .",
    "we will explain informally why each step of the computation provides an arbitrarily good approximation to a conformal map occurring at the corresponding step in the constructive proof of theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "note that the computation consists of finitely many circle packing steps . in",
    "each step we are approximating the solution of a problem whose solution depends continuously on its data .",
    "this should suffice to prove local uniform convergence of the approximations to the conformal map from @xmath0 to @xmath16 , but we will not attempt to estimate the rate of convergence .",
    "suppose we are given a bounded finitely connected domain @xmath0 in the complex plane .",
    "we find a sequence of circle packings @xmath276 in @xmath0 whose carriers exhaust @xmath0 .",
    "to construct @xmath276 we _ cut out _ a portion of the regular hexagonal circle packing with circles all of radius @xmath277 .",
    "this means that we keep only those circles whose interiors are entirely contained in @xmath0 .",
    "stephenson @xcite describes this as using @xmath7 as a ` cookie cutter '",
    ". we have to take some care at the boundary : we retain only the largest connected component of the hexagonal packing that remains , discarding any peripheral islands and iteratively removing vertices of degree one until we are left with a connected triangulation .",
    "when we take @xmath278 large enough , the boundary components of this triangulation will be in one - to - one correspondence with the complementary components of @xmath0 .",
    "next , to each cycle of boundary vertices of @xmath276 we adjoin a new ` ideal ' vertex , adjacent to all of the vertices in the cycle , and in this way we obtain a triangulation of the sphere . by the koebe - andreev - thurston theorem there is a circle packing whose nerve is this triangulation , and it is unique up to mbius transformations . consider what happens to this spherical packing as we let @xmath278 tend to @xmath44 .",
    "using quasiconformal distortion estimates for packings of bounded vertex degree , one can show that after a suitable mbius normalization , the circles corresponding to the added ideal vertices converge to limit circles of positive radius , while the maximum radius of the all the other circles tends to zero uniformly .",
    "let @xmath279 be the polyhedral map from the hexagonal cut - out packing @xmath276 to the carrier of the spherical packing , normalized so that three chosen points in @xmath0 are fixed by @xmath279 .",
    "it turns out that as @xmath280 , @xmath279 converges locally uniformly on @xmath0 to a conformal map from @xmath0 to a circle domain . to prove this",
    ", we can use the hex packing lemma of rodin and sullivan @xcite .",
    "this says that the quasiconformal dilatation of @xmath279 converges locally uniformly to @xmath29 on @xmath0 .",
    "the rodin - sullivan bound for the quasiconformal dilation on a given face of the triangulation depends only on the number of layers of hexagonal packing surrounding it , and tends to @xmath29 as the number of layers tends to infinity .",
    "let @xmath63 be any subdomain of @xmath0 bounded by jordan curves in @xmath0 , such that @xmath63 is homeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "the dilatation bound shows that the images of the maps @xmath279 restricted to @xmath63 remain within a compact subset of the teichmller space of multiply connected domains homeomorphic to @xmath0",
    ". any subsequential limit of the sequence @xmath279 must be a conformal homeomorphism , and its image must be a circle domain . given the normalization , there is a unique such homeomorphism .",
    "it follows that the sequence @xmath279 converges locally uniformly as @xmath281 .",
    "we can augment the image packings by inverting across all the ` ideal ' circles , adding circles of degree @xmath282 in the resulting four - sided interstices to maintain a triangulation . by considering moduli of ring domains in the resulting packing it is possible to show that the maximum radius of any non - ideal circle in the image packing also converges to @xmath29 as @xmath281 .",
    "suppose @xmath2 is one of the complementary components of @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath283 be an analytic universal covering map .",
    "to compute an approximation to the circle domain conformally equivalent to @xmath284 , we use the same trick again .",
    "we have a triangulation of @xmath16 , to which we add just one ideal vertex @xmath285 corresponding to the complementary component @xmath2 .",
    "now we apply thurston s algorithm to compute the _ hyperbolic _",
    "packing label for the resulting multiply connected triangulation .",
    "if we lay the circles out according to this packing label , we get a fuchsian monodromy group .",
    "call the resulting packing @xmath286 .",
    "the circle corresponding to @xmath285 and its translates under the monodromy group approximate the bounded components of the required circle domain . for the conformal welding step that follows we will only need to know the hyperbolic radii for the circles corresponding to the vertex @xmath285 and its neighbors .",
    "it is not necessary to perform the layout routine .        given a jordan curve @xmath136 in the riemann sphere , we can compute the riemann mappings of the unit disc onto the interior and the exterior of @xmath136 .",
    "the boundary values of these riemann mappings give two different continuous maps of the unit circle onto @xmath136 , @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "the shape of @xmath136 is encapsulated in the boundary correspondence @xmath289 , which is an orientation - reversing homeomorphism of the unit circle .",
    "conformal welding is the process of recovering @xmath136 ( up to a mbius map ) from the boundary correspondence .",
    "the ` circlepack ` software includes a package for performing approximate conformal welding , following the procedure described by williams @xcite .",
    "the idea is to paste two combinatorial closed discs together along their boundaries , according to a best possible combinatorial approximation of the given boundary correspondence , to produce a triangulation of the sphere .",
    "we then compute the circle packing for this triangulation .",
    "for example , we may start with two maximal packings of the unit disc ( meaning that the boundary circles are internally tangent to the unit circle ) , and use the arc length around the unit circle as a guide for pasting together the two triangulations , introducing new vertices where necessary to keep control of the vertex degrees .    in our application to intrinsic circle domains ,",
    "we weld a combinatorial closed disc to the boundary cycle corresponding to each complementary component @xmath2 of @xmath0 , using the arc length around the circle corresponding to @xmath285 in the packing @xmath286 and the trivial boundary correspondence @xmath290 . a suitable choice of combinatorial closed disc would be a large section of the regular hexagonal packing , for then the hex packing lemma of rodin and sullivan can be applied to show that the desired welding and the computed welding differ by a quasiconformal map which has small dilatation except on an annulus of small modulus and small area covering the cycle of edges along which the welding is performed . after performing a welding for each boundary component , we simply apply thurston s algorithm to compute a circle packing of the resulting spherical triangulation . in the case",
    "where the ambient riemann surface @xmath108 has positive genus , we would compute a packing of the universal cover of the welded complex at this stage to get a circle packing approximation to the riemann surface @xmath1 .",
    "the finished spherical circle packing gives an approximation to the map @xmath23 and to the desired conformal structure on the interior of each complementary component of @xmath28 , and on the interior of the image of @xmath28 .",
    "we sketch a proof that the approximation scheme described above does converge locally uniformly on the domain @xmath16 to the conformal mapping to an intrinsic circle domain , after suitable normalization .",
    "the strategy is to show that every map appearing in figure  [ f : existence proof ] is well approximated by the corresponding polyhedral map between circle packings .",
    "then since each step depends continuously on its input data , we will find that the polyhedral map from @xmath291 to @xmath275 converges locally uniformly on @xmath16 to the desired conformal mapping .    on the subcomplex of the packing representing the intrinsic circle domain ,",
    "the hex - packing distortion estimate of rodin and sullivan shows that the polyhedral mapping is quasiconformal with dilatation that converges locally uniformly to zero .",
    "we can apply a similar estimate on the interior of each complementary component .",
    "it remains to show that the conformal welding step is well approximated by the discrete conformal welding .",
    "to do this we have to control the conformal modulus of the image of a narrow annular neighborhood of each boundary component , where the circles are not deep enough in the hex packing for the rodin - sullivan estimate to give the bound we need .",
    "to do this it suffices to bound the maximum degree of the vertices appearing in the final triangulation .",
    "this is because the rodin - sullivan ring lemma allow the quasiconformal distortion of polyhedral maps between circle packings to be bounded in terms of the maximum degree .",
    "we can arrange that all vertices have degree @xmath292 except those involved in the combinatorial welding . the largest degree arising when we weld using the hyperbolic radii of the neighbors of @xmath285 in the packing @xmath286",
    "can be bounded in terms of the ratio between the radii of the largest and smallest circles adjacent to @xmath285 .",
    "since we began with a hex - packing of @xmath0 with circles all of equal radius , this ratio is controlled in the limit by the maximum and minimum value of the derivative on the boundary @xmath293 of the conformal map @xmath174 .",
    "examining the figures , the reader will note that in our numerical experiments we have not restricted ourselves to using hex packings as our starting point .",
    "instead we have used packings with few layers of degree @xmath294 vertices near the boundary , so that there can are many very small circles on the boundary without needing a very large number of circles in total .",
    "this was done to reduce the errors from the combinatorial welding step .",
    "we pay for this by having larger circles far from the boundary , and losing the rigorous distortion bounds , but this seems a worthwhile trade since we expect the schwarzian derivative of the map that we are approximating to be small on this region . in figures",
    "[ f : circle domain ] and  [ f : intrinsic circle domain ] there is a circle of degree @xmath295 fixed by a rotational symmetry of the packing of order @xmath296 .",
    "the schwarzian derivative of the map we are approximating must certainly vanish at the center of this circle , by symmetry considerations .",
    "apart from two circles of this type , the maximum degree in the packing is @xmath297 . in the packings in figures",
    "[ f : circle domain 2 ] and  [ f : intrinsic 2 ] , the maximum degree is @xmath294 .",
    "finally we comment that it may be more satisfactory from the point of view of computation , and also to simplify the convergence proof , to perform the discrete conformal welding using packings with specified overlap angles rather than restricting ourselves to tangency packings .",

    "<S> moreover the pair @xmath5 is unique up to conformal isomorphisms . </S>",
    "<S> we give a generalization to countably infinite connectivity . </S>",
    "<S> finally we show how one can compute numerical approximations to intrinsic circle domains using circle packings and conformal welding .    _ </S>",
