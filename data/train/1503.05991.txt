    "the target is the final steady state and expected to have peculiar features for quantum computation processing and other applications .",

    ", it is a crucial problem to develop techniques for generating entanglement among stationary qubits , which plays a central role in applications @xcite .",
    "bell states are specific maximally entangled quantum states of two qubits . for many - qubit system , there are two typical multipartite entangled states , greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and w states , which are usually referred to as maximal entanglement .",
    "multipartite entanglement has been recognized as a powerful resource in quantum information processing and communication .",
