    "electromagnetic energy transfer between dielectric bodies at different temperatures is commonly described using the fluctuational electrodynamics ( fed ) approach @xcite developed by rytov @xcite and first applied to condensed matter physics by lifshitz @xcite . according to fed , thermal motion of charged particles in a body creates random currents , which induce electromagnetic fields . outside the body ,",
    "the field is then either radiated to free space or absorbed in the near or far - field regime by another body .",
    "proximity effects involving the evanescent waves in the near - field were first observed by hargreaves @xcite , and fed was consequently applied to theoretically predict strong near - field enhancement of heat transfer in various geometries @xcite .",
    "the predictions have been explored in more detail also experimentally @xcite .",
    "near - field effects are expected to have numerous applications in , e.g. , thermal microscopy @xcite , infrared thermophotovoltaics @xcite and narrow - band infrared antennas @xcite .    as a statistical model , fed",
    "is closely related to langevin dynamics commonly applied to describe the random thermal motion of non - charged bodies @xcite . in langevin dynamics",
    "the particle is assumed to be coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators , whose effect on the particle can effectively be described by a random force and deterministic friction @xcite .",
    "huttner and barnett @xcite essentially applied langevin dynamics to study the quantization of the electromagnetic field in absorbing dielectrics by coupling the polarization field to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the explicit inclusion of the microscopic degrees of freedom responsible for absorption solves the problem of temporally decaying field commutators arising if one blindly applies the standard electromagnetic field quantization methods to dielectrics .",
    "relation of the langevin dynamics to fed was recently highlighted by rosa , dalvit and milonni @xcite , who used langevin dynamics to derive the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite for the fluctuating polarization field from the microscopic motion of the oscillating dipoles .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that the microscopic dipole oscillator model combined with quantum langevin dynamics can be used to transparently and microscopically treat also the problem of electromagnetic heat transfer between dielectric bodies held at different temperatures .",
    "the primary motivation for studying heat transfer using the quantum langevin equation instead of fed is that we can derive heat transfer rates in full analogy with phononic @xcite and electronic @xcite heat transfer and , by following the mathematical manipulations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we are able to arrive at an identical landauer - bttiker - like formula for the energy transmission function .",
    "the theory presented here enables , therefore , a unification of phononic , electronic and photonic heat transfer under the common langevin theory .",
    "when written in terms of particle polarizabilities and the electromagnetic green s function , the transmission function reduces to the form derived earlier from fed @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these works , we ( i ) consistently include the electromagnetic self - interaction produced by the local electromagnetic green s dyadic by following the discrete dipole approximation @xcite , ( ii ) include the inhomogeneous environment enabling , e.g. , accounting for cavity resonance effects , and ( iii ) present an alternative and conceptually simple way to derive electromagnetic energy transfer rates starting from the microscopic equations of motion . for presentational simplicity",
    ", we initially assume the particles to be small enough for the dipole approximation to hold .",
    "however , overcoming this assumption by following the well - established discrete dipole approximation mentioned above is also discussed .    as an application of the formalism",
    ", we study the enhancement of heat transfer rates between sic particles placed in a microcavity and close to a polar surface supporting surface phonon polaritons ( spps ) . in a microcavity",
    ", the heat transfer rate between particles is shown to oscillate as a function of their distance and the cavity enhancement can be several orders of magnitude as compared to the free space heat current with a similar interparticle distance .",
    "enhanced heat current is predicted also for particles close to a sic surface , where the spps transport electromagnetic energy between the particles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we present the formulation to calculate thermal energy transfer between dielectric particles and the environment .",
    "we ( i ) represent the polarization fields inside the particles by their total dipole moments , ( ii ) solve the quantum langevin equations of motion for coupled dipole moment dynamics in terms of the dipole displacement green s function , ( iii ) calculate the thermal averages of heat currents using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for the bath noises and the thermal field of the environment , and ( iv ) express the heat currents in terms of particle polarizabilities and the electromagnetic green s dyadic . in secs .",
    "[ sec : results_cavity ] and [ sec : results_surface ] , we investigate heat transfer between sic nanoparticles in a microcavity and above a sic surface , respectively .",
    "in this section we formulate the many - particle electromagnetic heat transfer problem in terms of the dipole approximation @xcite and langevin dynamics ( ld ) .",
    "our final results for the energy transfer rates are essentially equivalent to those obtained using fluctuational electrodynamics ( fed ) @xcite .",
    "therefore readers only interested in the numerical results regarding the energy transfer rates in inhomogeneous environments are not required to go through the rigorous derivations of this section to understand the results .",
    "however , our derivation based on ld provides an alternative view to the fed approach , offering additional insight to the physics involved .",
    "in contrast to the fed approach , where the electric fields and the induced dipole moments arising from the fluctuating dipole moments are solved to calculate the energy dissipated by the induced currents , ld is based on describing fluctuations by stochastic forces in the microscopic dipole equations of motion @xcite . with the help of poynting s theorem , we show that the locally absorbed power can be calculated in ld simply from the steady - state energy current to the local langevin heat bath .",
