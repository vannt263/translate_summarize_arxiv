    "the fermi momentum @xmath1 is large in the sense that the fs encloses a volume that counts both the number of conduction electrons and local moments  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to a small fermi momentum @xmath2 , whose fs encloses a volume that counts the number of conduction electrons only .",
    "an earlier issue debated on the klm was whether the formation of a large fs is consistent with luttinger s theorem  @xcite .",
    "in other terms , the question was whether the klm can account for a large fs given that the @xmath0 electrons are represented by their spin degrees of freedom only .",
    "investigations of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) klm through numerical  @xcite and analytical  @xcite approaches have yielded rather consistent evidence for a ground state with a large fs in the paramagnetic regions of the model . yet",
    "recent numerical calculations have suggested the existence of a second phase where the fs is small  @xcite .",
    "such a phase will necessary have a broken - symmetry ground state , otherwise it would be inconsistent with luttinger s theorem .",
    "@xcite for reviews on the 1d klm , we refer the reader to refs .   and  .",
    "in the last decade , the question of the size of the fs in the klm has gained renewed interest in connection with quantum criticality and the related non - fermi - liquid phases of heavy fermion materials .",
    "the local picture for the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) in these compounds predicts that the size of the fs would change abruptly at the quantum critical point  @xcite .",
    "the composite quasiparticles forming the large fs are projected to breakdown as the system is driven across the critical point , leaving behind a small fermi volume that counts the number of conduction electrons only .",
    "it is still unclear how such a sudden change of the fs is consistent with a second - order phase transition .",
    "one - dimensional models , for which powerful methods of solution are available , are currently the primary tool for gaining reliable information about qpt in the klm .",
    "however , magnetic orderings that break spin - rotational symmetry are prohibited in 1d .",
    "hence , it is necessary to study the qpt between the paramagnetic phase with a large fs and alternative phases of the ising or spin - peierls type  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0 electrons are in an ising or a dimerized phase , they would remain decoupled from the conduction electrons at low energies also in the presence of a sufficiently small kondo coupling as compared to the gap .",
    "consequently , the fs would be small .",
    "a qpt toward a ground state with a large fs would occur upon increasing the kondo coupling .",
    "this latter phase is presumably a luttinger liquid ( ll ) or a spin - gapped phase .    in this paper",
    ", we study the evolution of the ground state of a 1d klm from a spin - peierls phase with a small fermi momentum @xmath3 to a ll phase with a large fermi momentum @xmath4 . to this end",
    ", we augment the conventional klm with isotropic nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor spin - exchange interactions among the kondo spins , and tune them to the majumdar - ghosh point  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of next - nearest - neighbor coupling is a crucial ingredient of our study , as it supports a broken - symmetry ground state with a small fs for small kondo couplings .",
    "focusing on three - eighths filling and using the density - matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg )  @xcite , we find a zero - temperature transition that is more complex than the predictions of the local critical theory .",
    "in particular , we identify an intermediate spin - gapped phase in between the spin - peierls and ll phases where the fermi momentum can not be defined .",
    "instead , the electron momentum distribution function @xmath5 displays a shallow peak at a new characteristic momentum @xmath6 that lies in between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and which shifts toward @xmath4 on going from the spin - peierls to the ll phase .",
    "concomitantly , there is a maximum at @xmath7 in the magnetic structure factor @xmath8 of the kondo spins .",
    "we show that this behavior can be understood as a consequence of the magnetic frustration induced by competing spin - exchange couplings generated by the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction .",
    "in contrast to @xmath5 and @xmath8 , neither the fourier transform of the local conduction - electron density @xmath9 nor the density - density correlation function @xmath10 show any special signatures related to @xmath6 . rather , the transition from the spin - peierls to the spin - gapped phase is manifest in @xmath10 by the smearing of a cusp at @xmath11 and the emergence of a peak at @xmath12 .",
