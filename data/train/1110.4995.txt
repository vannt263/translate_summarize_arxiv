    "the objective of this paper is to show how intelligent states for some observables in the algebra @xmath0 can be explicitly constructed from coherent states .",
    "intelligent states for the observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 are states for which the strict equality @xmath3",
    "\\rangle \\vert , \\label{robertson}\\ ] ] holds @xcite .",
    "a state @xmath4 that satisfies eqn.([robertson ] ) also satisfies ( -i)= , , [ eigenvalueproblem ] _",
    "i.e.  _ intelligent states are eigenstates of the ( non  hermitian ) operator @xmath5 .",
    "coherent states are examples of intelligent states for appropriately chosen observables .",
    "it is well known for instance that the harmonic oscillator coherent states satisfy @xmath6 , with a similar property also holding for suitably chosen observables evaluated in an angular momentum coherent state .",
    "coherent states are a special case of intelligent states because , in addition to saturating the uncertainty relation of eqn.([robertson ] ) or its angular momentum analogue , the observables also satisfy @xmath7 ( in appropriate units ) .",
    "intelligent states generalize coherent states in the sense that eqn.([robertson ] ) still holds but in general @xmath8 .",
    "intelligent states , like coherent states , are not orthogonal .",
    "they were originally introduced for @xmath9 by aragone and collaborators @xcite .",
    "they were constructed for @xmath9 using a non  unitary transformation by rashid @xcite , and using polynomial states in @xcite . for @xmath10 coherent states",
    ", the construction often includes solving recursion relations @xcite .",
    "properties of @xmath9 and @xmath10 intelligent states have been used in the context of interferometry @xcite .",
    "our work is motivated in part by the resurgence of interest in systems with higher symmetries , such as three - well ( or @xmath11well ) bec , multiple  path interferometers _ etc_.",
    "concurrent with this is the considerable interest by the quantum information community in the study of uncertainty relations and their connection with entanglement @xcite and other non  classical properties of the system .",
    "intelligent states for observables in higher lie algebras thus appear to be a `` natural '' family of states to consider in order to explore such properties .",
    "in addition , the time evolution of angular wave packets associated with diatomic rigid molecules or with a quantum axially - symmetric rigid body has been studied using @xmath12 intelligent states @xcite .",
    "one could thus envisage that @xmath0 and @xmath13 intelligent states could be use to study the time evolution of more general wave packets .",
    "we will show in this paper how @xmath0 intelligent states can be constructed by coupling together three @xmath14 coherent states , in direct generalization of the method proposed in @xcite for @xmath9 and extended to @xmath10 in @xcite .",
    "we illustrate our method by choosing observables that do not transform by an @xmath12 subalgebra of @xmath0 , thus bypassing the restrictions found in @xcite .",
    "although @xmath14 clebsch - gordan technology can be quite formidable , the couplings we will require are of the simplest kind as we will restrict our discussion to states in representations of the type @xmath15 .",
    "the coupling method offers some distinct advantages over other possible constructions as it relies only on known special functions but not on recursion relations @xcite , and does not hinge on finding a suitable non  linear transformation @xcite .",
    "the coupling method is also immediately generalizable to higher groups once the appropriate coherent states have been found .",
    "finally , we note that the literature sometimes refer to intelligent states as `` minimum uncertainty states '' @xcite .",
    "we will stay away from this qualification : strictly speaking , the minimum of @xmath16 is @xmath17 and reached by choosing a normalized eigenstate of @xmath18 , something always possible in a finite  dimensional representation .",
    "by restricting our discussion to @xmath0 irreps of the type @xmath15 , we may consider the @xmath0 algebra to be spanned by the eight operators _ ij & = & a_i^a_j , ij=1,2,3 , + h_1 & = & a_2^a_2-a_1^a_1 , + h_2 & = & a_3^a_3-a_2^a_2 , constructed from harmonic oscillator creation and destruction operators .",
    "the elements in the algebra act in a natural way on three  dimensional harmonic oscillator states @xmath19 .",
    "for instance : c_12n_1n_2n_3 = n_1 + 1,n_2 - 1,n_3 .",
    "a set of basis states for the irrep @xmath15 of dimension @xmath20 is given by those three ",
    "dimensional harmonic oscillator states @xmath21 .",
    "an element @xmath22 of the group @xmath14 , with @xmath23 will be written in the form r()&=&r_12(_1,_1,-_1)r_23(_2,_2,-_2)t(_3,_3,_1,_2 ) , + t(_3,_3,_1,_2)&=&r_12(_3,_3,-_3)^i_1h_1^i_2h_2 .",
    "[ su3finite ] here , @xmath24 is a @xmath9 subgroup transformation mixing modes @xmath25 of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the angles @xmath26 range over @xmath27 . in the fundamental @xmath28 representation ,",
    "the subgroup transformations have the generic forms r_12(_12)= (    ccc * & * & 0 + & * & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1    ) , r_23(_23)= (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & * & * + 0 & * & *    ) .",
    "[ factors ] the @xmath29 are entries that make the blocks into @xmath9 transformations .",
    "the factored form of eqn.([su3finite ] ) can be verified by slightly modifying the factorization algorithm of @xcite .",
    "the lowest weight state of the irrep @xmath15 is @xmath30 .",
    "it is isotropic under transformations of the type @xmath31 given in eqn.([su3finite ] ) .",
    "thus we define an @xmath14 coherent state @xmath32 as the `` translated '' lowest weight state r_12(_1,_1,-_1)r_23(_2,_2,-_2)00 .",
    "intelligent states are tied to the product of fluctuations of some specified observables . for @xmath0 , a completely general pair of observables",
    "would be overly complicated , would hide the simplicity of the procedure and would not allow for a comfortable discussion of some of the results . with this in mind , we consider the following pair : @xmath33 with the commutation relation , @xmath34=\\frac{4\\pi^2}{9\\sqrt{3}}\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc }     0 & 1 & 1 \\\\      1 & 0 & -2 \\\\      1 & -2 & 0 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right).\\label{eq:3by3abcommutetoc}\\ ] ] besides being sufficiently simple yet not trivial , the physical motivation behind this choice is connected with properties of the eigenstates of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote any @xmath39-dimensional eigenvector of @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , then these eigenvectors are said to be mutually unbiased @xcite:@xmath42 in this perspective @xmath35 and @xmath36 are direct generalization of the pauli matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the eigenstates of which satisfy the overlap condition @xmath45    for calculational simplicity , it is convenient to go to a basis where @xmath46 $ ] is diagonal .",
    "this is done through the transformation @xmath47 with the result that our final observables are : = ^-1=- (    ccc 0 & & + & 0 & 0 + & 0 & 0    ) , + = ^-1= (    ccc 0 & & + & 0 & 0 + & 0 & 0    ) , + = ^-1= (    ccc 2 & 0 & 0 + 0 & -1- & 0 + 0 & 0 & -1 +    ) . the equality that defines intelligence , eqn.([robertson ] ) , then reads = || .      in the three  dimensional space carried by the ( fundamental ) @xmath28 representation , the eigenvalue problem of eqn.([eigenvalueproblem ] ) for the operator",
    "@xmath48 can be solved to yield the eigenvectors @xmath49 and eigenvalue @xmath50 given by |^1_1()&= n_1 (    c 0 + ^2 + 1    ) , & _ 1=0 , +     c + ^2 + 1    ) , & _ 2 = - , + ^1_3 ( ) & = n_3 (    c - + ^2 + 1    ) , & _ 3 = , where = [ su3mudef ] and",
    "@xmath51 is a normalization constant .",
    "these eigenvectors can all be identified with coherent states . indeed ,",
    "a generic coherent state in the irrep @xmath28 is of the form & = & r_12(_1,_1,-_1)r_23(_2,_2,-_2)001   + & = & (    c ^-i(_1+_2)_1_2 + -^-i_2_1 _ 2 + _ 2    ) .",
    "thus , we will write ^1_k ( ) = r(_k)001 , [ intelligentcoherent ] where @xmath52 are the angles defined so that eqn.([intelligentcoherent ] ) holds .",
    "simple comparison with the eigenstates @xmath49 produces the correct angles @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath54 , we immediately see that @xmath55 always .",

    "_ 12=-,&_22=- + _",
    "13=,&_23=-    for @xmath56 , the angles are easily determined from the magnitudes and phases of the appropriate ratios of entries .",
    "thus we have , quite generally , ( -i)r(_k)001 = _ kr(_k)001 , with @xmath50 the @xmath57th eigenvalue , which is real when @xmath54 but otherwise @xmath17 or purely imaginary .      now",
    "the eigenvalue problem is _ linear _ in the generators .",
    "thus , if @xmath58 and @xmath59 are intelligent , so is the product @xmath60 of two `` single particle '' intelligent states .",
    "more formally , if we definite the tensor product states _",
    "i^1 ( ) _ 1_j^1 ( ) _ 2_i^1 ( ) _ 1_j^2 ( ) _ 2 and the ( collective ) operators = a_1_2+_1_2 , = b_1_2+_1_2 , , with _ i^1 ( ) _ 1_j^1 ( ) _ 2&=&(a_1_2)(_i^1 ( ) _ 1_j^1 ( ) _ 2 ) + & & + ( _ 1_2)(_i^1 ( ) _ 1_j^1 ( ) _ 2 ) , + & = & ( a_1_i^1 ( ) _ 1)_j^1 ( ) _ 2+_i^1 ( ) _ 1(a_2_j^1 ( ) _ 2 ) , + & = & ( _ i+_j)_i^1 ( ) _ 1_j^1 ( ) _ 2 we see that the product of intelligent states is also intelligent .",
    "we start by noting that the @xmath61-fold product 00q = 001 _ 1001 _ 2  001 _ q is the lowest weight for @xmath62 . by the previous argument it follows that ^q_k ( ) ) & = & r(_k)00q   + & = & ( r(_k)_1001 _ 1)  (r(_k)_q001 _ q ) is also coherent and simultaneously intelligent ( we use the round ket to denote an unnormalized state ) .",
    "let us use this to construct the six intelligent states of @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the irrep @xmath65 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem takes the matrix form @xmath66with @xmath67 and @xmath68    rather than direct diagonalization , we use the coupling property to verify that the product ^2_k ( ) ) = ^1_k ( ) _ 1 ^ 1 _ ( ) _ 2+^1 _ ( ) _ 1 ^ 1_k ( ) _ 2 is contained in the irrep @xmath65 and is intelligent with eigenvalue @xmath69 .",
    "clearly there are six such states , symmetric under permutation of the `` particle index '' ; by construction they will be eigenstates of @xmath70 and thus intelligent",
    ". they must therefore be all the intelligent states of @xmath65 .    more generally , we start with the product _ _ 1_2_3 ( ) ) = .",
    "this state is intelligent by construction but belongs to the decomposable representation @xmath71 .",
    "we can project it to the irreducible space @xmath72 using clebsch - gordan technology .",
    "first , we write r(_k)00_k = _ _ 1_2_1_2_3 d^(_k,0)__1_2_3;00_k(_k ) where @xmath73 is determined by @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the @xmath14 @xmath76-function described in @xcite and given by the overlap _ 1_2_3 r_12(_1k,_1k,-_1k)r_23(_2k,_2k,-_2k)00_k , and @xmath77 is specified via eqn.([intelligentcoherent ] ) .",
    "next , we couple in sequence : & & _ 1_2_3 _ 1_1_2_3 _ 2_1_2_3 _ 3 + & & = _ 1_2_3",

    "note that because all kets ( including those occurring in the intermediate and final coupling ) belong to an irrep of the type @xmath62 that does not have any weight multiplicity , a simple listing of the triple @xmath80 is enough to uniquely identify the state and its weight .",
    "the product does not contain any sum because the weights of the intermediate and final states are completely specified by the weights of the initial states .",
