    "in recent years there has been important progress in understanding the dynamics that led to the formation of galaxies .",

    "one particular candidate for dark energy is a scalar field usually called quintessence @xcite . in this way galaxies",
    "are expected to possess dark components and , in accordance with the rotation curves of stars and gas around the centres of spirals , they might be in the form of halos @xcite and must contribute to at least 3 to 10 times the mass of the visible matter @xcite .    in order to construct numerical galaxies in a consistent way using gravity and particle physics components",
    ", one must find the correct physical scheme . the theoretical framework to explain the existence of dark components finds its origin in theories of elementary particles physics , with the addition of the action of gravity .",
    "there exist many theories ( grand unification schemes , string theories , brane worlds , etc ) that involve such physics , but scalar  tensor theories ( stt ) of gravity are typically found to represent classical effective descriptions of such original theories @xcite . in this way ,",
    "the scalar fields of these theories are the natural candidates to be the quintessence field @xcite , as a remnant of some cosmological function that contributes @xmath2 today .",
    "it has been even suggested that the quintessence field is the scalar field that also acts on local planetary scales @xcite or on galactic scales @xcite .",
    "moreover , massive scalar fields might account to the dark matter components of galaxies in the form of halos",
    ".    motivated by the above arguments , we study in the present report some stt effects in galactic systems .",
    "specifically , we compute potential  density pairs coming from such theories in their newtonian approximation",
    ". the results presented here will be useful in constructing numerical galaxies that are consistent with grand unification schemes .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we present the newtonian approximation of a general scalar ",

    "if one defines the perturbation @xmath9 , the newtonian approximation gives @xcite @xmath10 where we have introduced @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the above expansion",

    "there are stringent constraints on the possible @xmath25@xmath34 values determined by measurements on local scales @xcite .    in the past",
    "the above solutions have been used to solve the missing mass problem in spirals @xcite as an alternative to considering a distribution of dark matter .",
    "this was done assuming that most of the galactic mass is located in the galactic centre , and then considering the centre to be a point source . in our present investigation",
    "we do not avoid dark matter , since our model predicts that bosonic dark matter produces , through a scalar field associated to it , a modification of newtonian gravity theory .",
    "this dark matter is presumably clumped in the form of dark halos .",
    "therefore we will consider in what follows that a dark halo is spherically distributed along an observable spiral and beyond , having some density profile ( section 3 ) .",
