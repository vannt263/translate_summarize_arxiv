    "costly natural catastrophes in the recent past ( hurricane andrew in 1992 , the tsunami in thailand in 2004 , hurricane katrina in 2005 , the earthquake and tsunami in japan 2011 resulting in the nuclear disaster at fukushima , floods in thailand 2011 ) all caused severe stress to the ( re-)insurance industry .",
    "however , these losses are still small relative to losses of the us stock and bond markets .",
    "therefore securitization ( i.e.  transferring part of the risk to the financial market ) is an efficient alternative to reinsuring catastrophe ( cat ) losses , cf .  @xcite .",
    "contracts of this kind are insurance - linked derivatives .",
    "they are usually written on insurance industry catastrophe loss indices , insurer - specific catastrophe losses , or parametric indices based on the physical characteristics of catastrophe events .",
    "we focus on the first kind of products ; they involve more basis risk , but are less exposed to moral hazard than the others , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "derivates written on insurance industry catastrophe loss indices were first issued in 1992 by the chicago board of trade ; these were futures and later also call- and put spread options written on aggregate cat - loss indices , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a call spread option is a combination of a call option long and a call option short with a higher strike .",
    "another popular type of catastrophe derivative is the cat bond .",
    "this is a classical bond combined with an option that is triggered by a ( predefined ) catastrophe event .",
    "note that the buyer of the bond thereby sells the embedded option .",
    "the issuer is typically a ( re-)insurance company that wants to reinsure parts of its risk exposure on the financial market . in return",
    "the investor receives a coupon .",
    "cat derivatives are interesting for investors who seek to diversify their risk , since they are largely uncorrelated to classical financial instruments .",
    "+ the challenges in pricing cat derivatives are that the underlying index is not a traded asset , that they are not liquidly traded themselves and , maybe most of all , the modeling of catastrophe events .",
    "+ in the following we review the existing literature . for a more detailed literature overview",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "@xcite study european vanilla call options written on an insurance loss index , which is modeled by a jump - diffusion .",
    "@xcite model the aggregate loss of an insurance company by a poisson process with constant arrival rate of catastrophe events and derive a pricing formula for cat - puts .",
    "@xcite model the aggregate loss by a compound poisson process to describe the dynamic losses more accurately .",
    "@xcite derives the market price of insurance risk from cat derivative prices in a compound poisson model .",
    "@xcite use the method of utility indifference pricing to price cat derivatives written on an insurance loss index modeled by a compound poisson process .    for catastrophe events ,",
    "the assumption that the resulting claims occur at jump times of a poisson process as adopted by most previous studies is not beyond justifiable critique .",
    "a generalization was proposed by @xcite , who model the arrival of cat events by a doubly stochastic poisson process ( cox process ) , i.e. the arrival rate of claims is a stochastic process itself .",
    "see also @xcite for no - arbitrage pricing of cat bonds in this context .",
    "@xcite study the valuation of cat derivatives by risk neutral valuation , where the underlying is modeled as a cox process with shot noise intensity .",
    "+ in this paper we introduce a novel model for an insurance loss index and for a single insurance portfolio that captures ordinary insurance losses as well as catastrophe losses .",
    "we model the ordinary claims in the loss index by a compound poisson process with constant intensity and we model the arrival of catastrophes by a poisson process with constant intensity , where a jump triggers another stochastic variable that determines the number of claims in case of a catastrophe .",
    "the claims process of a single insurance company holding a fraction of the total number of contracts is then a _ dynamic thinning _ of the process describing the index .",
    "our model has the advantage that the jump height distribution does not need to capture both many small claims and outliers caused by catastrophes , but these outliers are split into many smaller claims . the dynamic thinning is reached in a very convenient way ( by drawing from a uniform distribution on @xmath0 $ ] ) that we believe to be applicable in many other situations .",
    "+ using this model we present a pricing mechanism for cat derivatives ( like cat spread options ) . since the insurance loss index is not a tradable asset , and since the market for cat derivatives is not liquid , we use the method of utility indifference pricing . for this",
    "we need a hedging mechanism , which will be an active management of the risk portfolio .",
    "the pricing method requires solving an associated stochastic optimization problem .",
    "our paper extends @xcite by a more realistic modeling approach for the insurance loss index and also for the thinning . in our paper",
    "a catastrophe event may partly hit the considered insurance company , whereas in @xcite a catastrophe event always only affects one company .",
    "their model for the claims process of a single insurance company is a thinning ( a change of the intensity ) of the poisson process driving the number of claims , while ours is a dynamic thinning of the claims for each event and thus has a different distribution of the jumps .",
    "we further introduce a way to compute the utility indifference price of the derivative by fourier techniques .",
    "this method also allows to compute the residual risk and the profit - loss distribution and therefore to evaluate coherent risk measures .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : modeling ] we model the insurance loss index and the claims process of a single insurance company .",
    "the state process based on which the cat derivative is priced , is identified as a piecewise deterministic markov process ( pdmp ) , see @xcite . in section [ sec : pricing ] we recall the general concept of utility indifference pricing and we solve the associated stochastic optimization problem . in section",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we show how the utility indifference price and also quantities relevant for risk management can be computed efficiently , and we present a numerical study .",
    "let @xmath1 be a probability space carrying all stochastic variables appearing below .",
    "suppose we have a global claims process @xmath2 , which keeps track of all property insurance claims in a given country and we consider an insurance company in the same country , so that the index will contain the losses of that particular insurance company among others .",
    "the portfolio income rate consisting of the premium revenues from the risk portfolio is given by a continuous function @xmath3 of the company s market share @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath3 is not necessarily linear in @xmath5 , since demand for insurance might depend on the premium the company charges .",
    "the wealth process of the insurance company can be controlled by managing the insured portfolio , i.e.  by controlling the market share @xmath5 .",
    "this allows for optimizing the management strategy for maximizing utility from terminal wealth .",
    "therefore , we can apply the method of utility indifference pricing for the valuation of cat - derivatives .",

    "the random variables @xmath12 , @xmath13 , describe the number of claims in case of a catastrophe .",
    "the process @xmath14 describes the occurrence of regular claims whereas a jump of @xmath15 indicates an accumulation of @xmath16 claims due to a catastrophe event .",

    "let @xmath22 be a poisson process with intensity @xmath23 and jump times @xmath24 and let the number of claims per jump of @xmath25 be denoted by @xmath26 with @xmath27 we can write the insurance loss index as @xmath28 both @xmath29 and the distribution of @xmath30 are chosen such that and are equivalent .",

    "in contrast to a model where the claims process is a simple compound poisson process , here assuming the existence of exponential moments of the claim size distribution is not a great restriction , since we model catastrophes as an accumulation of small claims rather than one big claim .",
