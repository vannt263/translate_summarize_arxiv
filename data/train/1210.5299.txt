    "phenotypic plasticity is a common process , whereby phenotypic changes occur during an organism s life cycle . in some cases ,",
    "phenotypic plasticity can emerge as a response to environmental variation .",
    "for example , the desert locust transitions from a solitary to a gregarious phase , depending on population density  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a phenotype can fluctuate randomly , for example , as a result of the stochasticity of gene expression , exemplified by recent studies in microorganisms  @xcite and animal development  @xcite .",
    "such processes are also interpreted as phenotypic plasticity , and are ubiquitous in nature .",
    "given this , the role of random phenotypic plasticity in adaptive evolution warrants further consideration .",
    "do phenotypic changes in individuals have any impacts across generations , and thus , influence their evolution ? at first glance ,",
    "phenotypic plasticity does not seem to affect evolutionary processes because only genotypes , rather than phenotypes , are heritable .",
    "non - heritable phenotypes acquired during the life cycle , however , can affect evolution through natural selection because the natural selection acts on acquired phenotypes .",
    "this does not mean lamarckism  heritability of acquired phenotypes , but indicates that genetically determined plasticity , i.e. , an ability to change phenotypes , can affect the evolutionary process .",
    "this process is referred to as the baldwin effect , which was first introduced by baldwin  @xcite , and later recast by simpson  @xcite .",
    "several studies  @xcite have revealed that this effect is advantageous under a fluctuating environment , as phenotypic plasticity can allow organisms to survive sudden environmental changes , and therefore , facilitate adaptation to new environments",
    ". however , whether phenotypic plasticity is advantageous throughout evolution , even under fixed environments , is still elusive .",
    "can phenotypic plasticity accelerate evolutionary rate ?",
    "this question stems from a recent incarnation of the baldwin effect known as the `` baldwin expediting effect ''",
    "indeed , the seminal work by hinton and nowlan  @xcite showed that phenotypic plasticity accelerates evolutionary rate even in fixed environments , although , the validity of these findings is controversial . for example",
    ", several subsequent studies have shown that phenotypic plasticity can decelerate evolutionary rate  @xcite , whereas others have claimed that it accelerates evolutionary rate  @xcite . however , it is important to note that the studies@xcite in which it was concluded that phenotypic plasticity leads to a deceleration of evolutionary rate dealt with uni - modal gaussian fitness landscapes  @xcite .",
    "recently , some studies pointed out that , under a multi - peaked fitness , phenotypic plasticity can smoothen fitness valleys , and thus , the escape from a local maximum can be enhanced , leading to the acceleration of evolution  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the acceleration of evolution under a multi - peaked fitness landscape has been confirmed numerically  @xcite .",
    "the first analytical result addressing evolution under a multi - peaked fitness landscape in a fixed environment was provided by borenstein et al .",
    "@xcite , in which they showed that phenotypic plasticity accelerates evolution . instead of a mutation - selection process",
    ", they considered a single random walker on a multi - peaked fitness landscape , to mimic evolutionary population dynamics in genotypic space ; therefore , their study did not distinguish between the behaviors of a population and an individual .",
    "thus , in their random walker model the following three points were left unaddressed ; first , average population fitness has not been obtained analytically ; second , behaviors of the distribution of a population can not be discussed in their model ; and third , the relationship between the acceleration of evolution and average population fitness is unclear .",
    "these points should be clarified in order to fully comprehend the role of phenotypic fluctuation ( plasticity ) in evolutionary population dynamics .    in this study , we investigate evolutionary population dynamics , rather than the single random walker model , under multi - peaked landscapes in a fixed environment , and study the role of phenotypic fluctuation on the evolutionary rate .",
    "we provide analytical results for the relationship between phenotypic fluctuation , evolutionary rate , and average population fitness by considering the distribution of genotypes in a population .",
    "first , we assess whether a population located at a fitness peak can remain around the peak over generations to maintain high fitness .",
    "we show that for both large phenotypic fluctuations and high mutation rates , populations fail to keep descendants near the peak over multiple generations , and therefore , they are unable to maintain a high average fitness .",
    "second , we evaluate the rate at which a population moves between fitness peaks and derive an analytical expression representing the dependency of evolutionary rate on phenotypic fluctuation .",
    "the obtained result indicates that phenotypic fluctuation always enhances diffusion in genotypic space , and thus , it accelerates evolution under multi - peaked fitness landscapes .",
    "one consequence of our results is that for a large phenotypic fluctuation , the failure of a population to concentrate near a fitness peak results in a decrease in average fitness . this can be regarded as `` error catastrophe . ''",
    "the concept of error catastrophe refers to the collapse of a population that maintains high fitness because of a high mutation rate  @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that error catastrophe occurs not only because of a high mutation rate , but also because of large phenotypic fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , our results illustrate an apparent relationship between error catastrophe and the baldwin effect , in that error catastrophe is explained as an extreme case of a trade - off between an acceleration of evolutionary rate and a decrease in fitness .",
    "these findings reveal novel aspects of the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution .",

    "our claim of the acceleration of evolution by phenotypic fluctuation is different from fisher s fundamental theorem  @xcite , which claims that genotypic variance is proportional to evolutionary rate . in fisher s theorem , the phenotypic plasticity or fluctuations are not considered , and the effect of mutation is also ignored , whereas in our results , genetic variance , phenotypic effect , and the effect of mutation are incorporated .",
    "a possible relationship between the phenotypic fluctuation and genotypic variance was also discussed in  @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) phenotypic fluctuation exhibits trade - off relationships with the acceleration of evolution and degradation of fitness .",
    "this conclusion is reached by combining the results ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) .",
    "this trade - off relationship is illustrated by both fig .",
    "3 and fig .  6 ,",
    "in which greater phenotypic fluctuation results in a smaller fitness value and a larger evolutionary rate .",
    "in addition , the transition to the extended phase ( the error catastrophe ) for larger phenotypic fluctuation can be interpreted as an extreme situation of this trade - off .",
    "it is well established that an increase in mutation rate leads to the same trade - off relationship between the evolutionary rate and degradation of fitness , and that error catastrophe occurs as an extreme case of the trade - off .",
    "our results indicate that phenotypic fluctuation introduces an additional mutation rate , although the origin of the phenotypic fluctuation is essentially different from that of mutation .",
    "note that this `` additional mutation rate '' effect of phenotypic fluctuation works only in case of multi - peaked fitness landscape , but not in case of a unimodal fitness landscape  @xcite .    throughout the present study ,",
    "we interpret random phenotype fluctuation as a kind of phenotypic plasticity ( i.e. , the phenotypic distribution of a single genotype is independent of environment and fitness ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpmap ] ) ) ) .",
    "several previous studies addressing the baldwin effect also adopted random fluctuation as phenotypic plasticity  @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that even random phenotypic fluctuation accelerates the evolutionary rate under a multi - peaked fitness landscape .",
    "another interpretation of the phenotypic plasticity is that phenotype distribution of a given genotype depends on the fitness landscape , referred to as responsive plasticity  @xcite .",
    "the difference between phenotypic fluctuation and responsive plasticity is only in the modulation of a fitness landscape by phenotypic changes , and therefore , the techniques that we adopted in the present study ( e.g. , the transformation of fokker - planck - like equation into the schr@xmath0dinger equation , wkb approximation ) are applicable after a modulated fitness is obtained ; these techniques are generally useful for investigations of evolutionary dynamics  @xcite .    in our model",
    ", we assume that both genotype and phenotype are represented as a one - dimensional continuous value and the mapping between them is straightforward ( assumptions often employed in quantitative genetics  @xcite ) . because such simplicity could miss potential importance of high dimensionality and complexity in real genotype - phenotype mapping , we give brief remarks here . a high dimensional binary genotype model with a simple fitness landscape",
    "was adopted in some old studies  @xcite , especially the work by hinton and nowlan  @xcite demonstrated the validity of baldwin effect in the model .",
    "recently , relevance of phenotypic fluctuation ( noise in developmental process ) to mutational robustness has been studied by models with high - dimensional genotype space and with non - trivial genotype - phenotype mapping  @xcite .",
    "although these studies did not intend to validate the baldwin effect , some of their results share a mechanism of the acceleration effect of evolution ; their conclusion suggested that smoothening fitness landscape by phenotypic fluctuation prevents from trapping in local maximum of fitness , which is also important for the baldwin effect .",
    "for this reason , it is reasonable to expect that the baldwin effect is valid even for the case with high dimensional genotype space under a rugged fitness landscape . to confirm this statement ,",
    "however , further studies are required .    in this paper",
    "we study an infinite population model in which population is always genetically polymorphic and there is no fixation event of a single genotype",
    ". it will be important for future research to extend our study to include cases with finite populations , in which both the genetic drift and phenotypic fluctuations have to be taken into account seriously .",
    "so far , mounting experimental evidence supports that fitness landscapes in real organisms are multi - peaked  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has also been shown that stochasticity and random fluctuations in phenotypes are common in living systems  @xcite . in the presence of such fluctuation and multi - peaked fitness landscape ,",
    "our analytical study has demonstrated the relationship between phenotypic fluctuation and evolutionary rate , as well as the relationship between the baldwin effect and error catastrophe .",
    "therefore , our findings have broad implications for the study of evolutionary dynamics .",
