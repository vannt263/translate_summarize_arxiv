    "for a beneficial application of pedestrians dynamics , robust and quantitatively verified models are required .",
    "a wide spectrum of models has been designed to simulate pedestrian dynamics .",
    "generally these models can be classified into macroscopic and microscopic models . in macroscopic models",
    "the system is described by mean values of characteristics of pedestrian streams e.g. , density and velocity , whereas microscopic models consider the movement of individual persons separately .",
    "microscopic models can be subdivided into several classes e.g. , rule - based and force - based models . for a detailed discussion , we refer to  @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on spatially continuous force - based models .",
    "force - based models take newton s second law of dynamics as a guiding principle .",
    "given a pedestrian @xmath0 with coordinates @xmath1 we define the set of all pedestrians that influence pedestrian @xmath0 at a certain moment as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a cutoff radius .",
    "we say pedestrian @xmath0 `` feels '' pedestrian @xmath4 if the line joining their centers of mass does not intersect any obstacle . in a similar way we define the set of walls or borders that act on pedestrian @xmath0 as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nearest point on the wall @xmath7 to the pedestrian @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the movement of each pedestrian is defined by the equation of motion @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the repulsive force from pedestrian @xmath4 acting on pedestrian @xmath0 , @xmath10 is the repulsive force emerging from the obstacle @xmath7 and @xmath11 is a driving force . @xmath12 is the mass of pedestrian @xmath0 .",
    "the repulsive forces model the collision - avoidance performed by pedestrians and should guarantee a certain volume exclusion for each pedestrian .",
    "the driving force , on the other hand , models the intention of a pedestrian to move to some destination and walk with a certain desired speed .",
    "the set of equations  ( [ eq : maineq ] ) for all pedestrians results in a high - dimensional system of second order ordinary differential equations .",
    "the time evolution of the positions and velocities of all pedestrians is obtained by numerical integration .",
    "most force - based models describe the movement of pedestrians qualitatively well .",
    "collective phenomena like lane formation  @xcite , oscillations at bottlenecks  @xcite , the `` faster - is - slower '' effect @xcite , clogging at exit doors  @xcite are reproduced .",
    "these achievements indicate that these models are promising candidates for realistic simulations",
    ". however , a qualitative description is not sufficient if reliable statements about critical processes , e.g. , emergency egress , are required .",
    "moreover , implementations of models often require additional elements to guarantee realistic behavior , especially in high density situations . here",
    "strong overlapping of pedestrians @xcite or negative and high velocities @xcite occur which then has to be rectified by replacing the equation of motion ( [ eq : maineq ] ) by other procedures .",
    "force - based models contain free parameters that can be adequately calibrated to achieve a good quantitative description @xcite .",
    "however , depending on the simulated geometry the set of parameters often changes . in most works quantitative investigations of pedestrian dynamics were restricted to a specific scenario or geometry , like one - dimensional motion @xcite , behavior at bottlenecks @xcite , two - dimensional motion @xcite or outflow from a room @xcite .    in this work we restrict ourselves to corridors and address the possibility of describing the movement of pedestrians in wide and narrow corridors reasonably and in a quantitative manner with a unique set of parameters . at the same time",
    ", the modelling approach should be as simple as possible .    in the next section ,",
    "we propose such a model which is solely based on the equation of motion  ( [ eq : maineq ] ) .",
    "furthermore the model incorporates free parameters which allow calibration to fit quantitative data .",
    "the centrifugal force model ( cfm )  @xcite takes into account the distance between pedestrians as well as their relative velocities .",
    "pedestrians are modelled as circular disks with constant radius .",
    "their movement is a direct result of superposition of repulsive and driving forces acting on the center of each pedestrian .",
    "repulsive forces acting on pedestrian @xmath0 from other pedestrians in their neighborhood and eventually from e.g. walls and stairs to prevent collisions and overlapping .",
    "the driving force , however , adds a positive term to the resulting force , to enable movement of pedestrian @xmath0 in a certain direction with a given desired speed  @xmath13 .",
    "the mathematical expression for the driving force is given by @xmath14 with a time constant @xmath15 .",
    "given the direction connecting the positions of pedestrians @xmath0 and @xmath4 : @xmath16        the repulsive force then reads ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : frep - direction ] ) @xmath17 this definition of the repulsive force in the cfm reflects several aspects .",
    "first , the force between two pedestrians decreases with increasing distance . in the cfm it is inversely proportional to their distance @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the repulsive force takes into account the relative velocity @xmath19 between pedestrian @xmath0 and pedestrian @xmath4 .",
    "the following special definition provides that slower pedestrians are not affected by the presence of faster pedestrians in front of them : @xmath20 \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\begin{cases }     ( \\overrightarrow{v_i}-\\overrightarrow{v_j})\\cdot     \\overrightarrow{e_{ij } } & \\quad\\mbox{if}\\;\\ ;     ( \\overrightarrow{v_i}-\\overrightarrow{v_j})\\cdot     \\overrightarrow{e_{ij } } > 0 \\\\ 0 & \\quad\\mbox{otherwise . }   \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as in general pedestrians react only to obstacles and pedestrians that are within their perception , the reaction field of the repulsive force is reduced to the angle of vision ( @xmath21 ) of each pedestrian , by introducing the coefficient @xmath22 the coefficient @xmath23 is maximal when pedestrian @xmath4 is in the direction of movement of pedestrian @xmath0 and minimal when the angle between @xmath4 and @xmath0 is bigger than @xmath24 .",
    "thus the strength of the repulsive force depends on the angle .",
    "as mentioned earlier the cfm is complemented with a `` collision detection technique '' ( cdt ) to manage conflicts and mitigate overlappings between pedestrians .",
    "[ fig : cdt ] depicts schematically the definition of the cdt .",
    "although cdt is relatively simple , it adds an amount of complexity to the initial model defined with eq .",
    "( [ eq : maineq ] ) and masks the main idea behind the repulsive forces . in the following",
    "we systematically modify the expression of the repulsive force to enable a better quantitative description of pedestrian dynamics .",
    "in this work we consider a velocity - dependent volume exclusion of pedestrians .",
    "overlapping between two pedestrians occurs when their geometrical form ( circle , ellipse , ... ) overlaps .",
    "modelling a pedestrian as a circle or ellipse is just an approximation of the human body .",
    "therefore , a certain amount of overlapping could be acceptable and might be interpreted as `` elastic deformation '' . however , for the deformed body the center of mass no longer coincides with the center of the circle or ellipse .",
    "for this reason overlapping is a serious problem that should be dealt with .    in",
    "@xcite it was shown that the introduction of a cdt is necessary to mitigate overlapping among pedestrians .",
    "the cdt keeps pedestrians away from each other with a distance of at least @xmath25 , where @xmath25 represents the radius of the circle modelling the volume exclusion of pedestrians .",
    "our goal is to simplify the model by dispensing with the cdt and improve the repulsive force to compensate for the effects of the missing cdt on the dynamics . to introduce the shape of the modeled pedestrians in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cfmfrep ] ) we transform the singularity of the repulsive force from @xmath26 to @xmath27 : @xmath28 due to the quotient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modcfmfrep1 ] ) when the distance is small , low relative velocities lead to an unacceptably small force .",
    "consequently , partial or total overlapping is not prevented .",
    "introducing the intended speed in the numerator of the repulsive force eliminates this side - effect .",
    "this dependence on the desired speed is motivated by the observation that for faster pedestrians stronger repulsive forces are required to avoid collisions with other pedestrians and obstacles .",
    "thus , the repulsive force is changed to @xmath29 with a free parameter @xmath30 to adjust the strength of the force .",
    "those two changes in the repulsive force cause the emergence of two phenomena : overlapping and oscillations . in the following",
    "we will define quantities to study those phenomena .",
    "avoiding overlapping between pedestrians and oscillations in their trajectories is difficult to accomplish in force - based models .",
    "on one hand , increasing the strength of the repulsive force with the aim of excluding overlapping during simulations leads to oscillations in the trajectories of pedestrians .",
    "consequently backward movements occur , which is not realistic especially in evacuation scenarios .    on the other hand , reducing the strength of the repulsive force ( to avoid oscillations ) leads inevitably to overlapping between pedestrians or between pedestrians and obstacles .    to solve this dilemma one has to find an adequate value of the strength of the repulsive force",
    ": it should neither be too high so that oscillations will appear , nor too low so that overlapping will be observed .    to understand this duality we quantify overlapping and oscillations during simulations .",
    "first , we define an overlapping - proportion during a simulation as : @xmath31 with @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of simulated pedestrians .",
    "@xmath34 is the overlapping area of the circles @xmath0 and @xmath4 with areas @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : oij ] ) .",
    "@xmath37 is the cardinality of the set @xmath38 for @xmath39 , @xmath40 is set to zero .     and",
    "@xmath4 varies between 0 and 1 . ]    for a pedestrian with velocity @xmath41 and desired velocity @xmath42 we define the oscillation - proportion as @xmath43 where @xmath44 quantifies the oscillation - strength of pedestrian @xmath0 and is defined as follows : @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the cardinality of the set @xmath48 here again @xmath49 is set to zero if @xmath50 . the proportions @xmath40 and @xmath49 are normalized to 1 and describe the evolution of the phenomena overlapping and oscillations during a simulation .    in order to exemplify the behavior of these two coupled phenomena we simulate an evacuation of 35 pedestrian from a @xmath51 room with an exit of @xmath52 and determine @xmath40 and @xmath49 for different values of @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modcfmfrep2 ] ) .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : os - ov ] .",
    "@xmath53 is a special case of the model and represents the cfm @xcite .",
    "the high values of the overlapping proportion suggest that simulations using only cfm without the cdt lead to unreasonable results . for further details we refer to  @xcite .     and",
    "overlapping - proportion @xmath40 as function of the interaction strength @xmath30 obtained from 200 simulations with different initial conditions .",
    "oscillations increase with increasing strength of the repulsive force , while overlaps become negligible for larger @xmath30 .",
    "the case @xmath53 is the cfm . in",
    "each run the simulations for different @xmath30 are started with the same initial values . ]",
    "the introduction of the intended velocity in the repulsive force enhances the ability of the repulsive force to guarantee the volume exclusion of pedestrians .",
    "this is reflected by the decreasing of the overlapping - proportion @xmath40 while increasing @xmath30 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : modcfmfrep2 ] ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : os - ov ] .    meanwhile , the oscillation - proportion @xmath49 increases , thus the system tends to become instable .",
    "large values of the oscillation - proportion @xmath49 imply less stability . for @xmath54 one",
    "has @xmath55 , i.e.  a pedestrian moves backwards with desired velocity .",
    "even values of @xmath56 higher than 1 are not excluded and can occur during a simulation .",
    "therefore , a careful calibration of @xmath30 is required to achieve an optimal balance between overlapping and oscillations .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to adjust the strength of the repulsive force by means of @xmath30 in order to get an overlapping - free and meanwhile an oscillation - free simulation . nevertheless , by proper choice of @xmath30 one can reduce the amount of overlapping among pedestrians such that it becomes negligible and can be interpreted as a deformation .",
    "this characteristic of the gcfm is not fulfilled by the cfm @xcite , where total overlapping ( @xmath57 ) can be observed .",
    "furthermore , the quantities @xmath49 and @xmath40 provide a criterion to choose an optimal value for @xmath30 , which is given by the intersection of the curves representing @xmath49 and @xmath40 .",
    "it is suggested that the effective space requirement of a moving pedestrian varies with velocity . usually , the projection of the pedestrian s shape to the two - dimensional plane is modeled as a circle with a radius @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "thompson suggested a three - circle representation for main body and shoulders @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "however , the radius of the circle varies such that the space requirement of pedestrians increases significantly as speed increases . in @xcite",
    "a linear velocity - dependence @xmath58 of the radius with parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 was suggested .",
    "`` space requirement '' encompasses the physical area taken by the torso together with the motion of the legs , lateral swaying and a safety margin .",
    "the repulsive force reads @xmath61 with @xmath62 the effective distance between pedestrian @xmath0 and @xmath4 and @xmath63 the radius of pedestrian @xmath0 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diam ] ) .",
    "one drawback of circles that impact negatively the dynamics is their rotational symmetry with respect to their centers .",
    "therefore , they occupy the same amount of space in all directions . in single file movement",
    "this is irrelevant since the circles are projected to lines and only the required space in movement direction matters .",
    "however , in two dimensional movement the aforementioned symmetry lasts by occupying unnecessary lateral space .    in @xcite fruin",
    "introduced the `` body ellipse '' to describe the plane view of the average adult male human body .",
    "pauls @xcite presented ideas about an extension of fruin s ellipse model to better understand and model pedestrian movement as density increases .",
    "templer @xcite noticed that the so called `` sensory zone '' , which is a bubble of space between pedestrians and other objects in the environment to avoid physical conflicts and for psychocultural reasons , varies in size and takes the shape of an ellipse .",
    "in fact , ellipses are closer to the projection of required space of the human body on the plane , including the extent of the legs during motion and the lateral swaying of the body .    having the ambition to describe with the same set of parameters the dynamics in one- and two - dimensional space we extend our model by introducing an elliptical volume exclusion of pedestrians . given a pedestrian @xmath0 we define an ellipse with center ( @xmath64,@xmath65 ) , major semi - axis @xmath66 and minor semi - axis @xmath67 . @xmath66",
    "models the space requirement in the direction of movement . in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq : diam ] ) we set @xmath68 with two parameters @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "fruin @xcite observed body swaying during both human locomotion and while standing .",
    "pauls @xcite remarks that swaying laterally should be considered while determining the required width of exit stairways . in @xcite characteristics of lateral",
    "swaying are determined experimentally .",
    "observations of experimental trajectories in @xcite indicate that the amplitude of lateral swaying varies from a maximum @xmath71 for slow movement and gradually decreases to a minimum @xmath72 for free movement when pedestrians move with their free velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sway ] ) .",
    "thus we describe with @xmath67 the lateral swaying of pedestrians and set @xmath73 since @xmath66 and @xmath67 are velocity - dependent , the inequality @xmath74 does not always hold for the ellipse @xmath0 . in the rest of this work",
    "we denote the semi - axis in the movement direction by @xmath66 and its orthogonal semi - axis by @xmath67 .",
    "in this section we give some mathematical insights concerning the implementation of the repulsive forces .      in order to calculate the repulsive force emerging from pedestrian @xmath4 acting on pedestrian @xmath0 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : modcfmfrep3 ] ) we require the distance between the borders of the ellipses , along a line connecting the two pedestrians @xmath75 . see app .",
    "[ sec : dist ] for more details on @xmath75 .",
    "another important quantity is the distance of closest approach or contact distance of two ellipses @xmath76 which is the minimum of @xmath75 while @xmath0 and @xmath4 are not overlapping . unlike for circles",
    ", @xmath76 can be non - zero for ellipses and depends on their orientations . in @xcite an analytical expression for the distance of the closest approach of two ellipses with arbitrary orientation",
    "is derived .",
    "[ fig : interp - dir ] shows how @xmath75 and @xmath76 goes in the repulsive force .",
    "the repulsive force between a pedestrian @xmath0 and a wall is zero if @xmath0 performs a parallel motion to the wall . while this behavior of the force is correct , it leads to very small repulsive forces when the pedestrians motion is almost parallel to the wall .",
    "for this reason we characterize in this model walls by three point masses acting on pedestrians within a certain interaction range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fuss ] ) .",
    "the middle point is the point with the shortest distance from the center of the pedestrian to the line segment of the wall .",
    "all three points have to be computed at each step as the pedestrian moves .",
    "the distance between the three wall points is set to the minor semi - axis of an ellipse if one lateral point ( @xmath77 or @xmath77 ) does not lie on the line segment of the wall , then it will not be considered in the computation of the repulsive force .",
    "the number of point masses have been chosen by a process of trial and error .",
    "simulations have shown that three point masses are sufficient to keep pedestrians away from walls .",
    "meanwhile they are computationally cost - effective .",
    "as walls are static objects , the repulsive force emerging from a wall @xmath7 and acting on pedestrian @xmath0 simplifies to @xmath78 with @xmath79 @xmath80 is the component of the velocity normal to the wall , @xmath81 and @xmath82 as defined resp . in eqs .",

    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : modcfmfrepw ] ) , @xmath81 in the force is independent of the chosen lateral wall point @xmath87 .",
    "that means , if a pedestrian is moving parallel to the wall , @xmath88 and thus the points @xmath89 and @xmath90 have no effects .      in this section",
    "we describe a numerical treatment of the repulsive force . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we focus on the case of pedestrian - pedestrian interactions .",
    "the pedestrian - wall case is treated similarly .    the strength of the repulsive force decreases with increasing distance between two pedestrians .",
    "nevertheless the range of the repulsive force is infinite .",
    "this is unrealistic for interactions between pedestrians .",
    "therefore , we introduce a cut - off radius @xmath91 for the force limiting the interactions to adjacent pedestrians solely . to guarantee robust numerical integration a two - sided hermite - interpolation of the repulsive force is implemented .",
