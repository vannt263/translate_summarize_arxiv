    "in order to prove that the state at which polariton condensation takes place is located at the top of the @xmath1 band , as reported in fig .  3 , we show here a detailed power dependence of the emission across the condensation threshold . at low power [ fig .",
    "[ condensationpi](b ) ] , below threshold , all the low energy bands are populated . at the @xmath20",
    "point a brighter point is observed showing efficient relaxation towards that state .",
    "when we approach the threshold for condensation we observe that particles start to accumulate at the top of the @xmath1 band [ fig .",
    "[ condensationpi](c ) ] . above threshold",
    "it is that particular state the one that becomes macroscopically occupied ( fig .",
    "[ condensationpi](d ) ) .",
    "note that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands continuously blueshift when increasing the excitation power due to the repulsive interactions between polaritons populating that band and the highly populated exciton reservoir located at the bare exciton energy ( about 20  mev above in energy ) .",
    "to simulate polariton condensation in the honeycomb structure we have used a 2d gross - pitaevskii equation with additional terms describing the polariton lifetime , spontaneous polariton scattering ( noise ) , stimulated scattering term ( included in the form of a saturated gain , accounting for scattering from the reservoir ) and kinetic energy relaxation that takes the form of an energy - dependent decay term  @xcite :    @xmath41    here @xmath42 is the polariton mass , @xmath43 is the kinetic energy relaxation term , @xmath44 is the polariton - polariton interaction constant ( @xmath45  mev is the exciton binding energy and @xmath46  nm is the exciton bohr radius ) , @xmath47 is the honeycomb lattice potential ( height 20 mev ) , containing an imaginary part accounting for the shorter lifetime induced by the evanescent part of the modes outside of the pillars . @xmath47",
    "eventually gives rise to the honeycomb dispersion , including the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands .",
    "@xmath48 is the potential induced by the reservoir , which we take to be equal to 1  mev for the considered injected polariton density @xmath49 .",
    "the reservoir has a gaussian shape with a width of @xmath50 m given by the size of the excitation spot .",
    "@xmath51 is the polariton lifetime ( 30 ps ) , @xmath52 is the saturated stimulated scattering rate from the reservoir to the condensate , and @xmath53 is the gaussian noise term with amplitude @xmath54 .",
    "for this set of parameters the simulations reproduce condensation at the @xmath20 point on the top of the @xmath1 band , as in the experiment . the condensation mechanism in that negative mass state",
    "can be understood as follows .",
    "first , the reservoir of excitons created by the nonresonant pump creates a repulsive potential for polaritons , which pushes away particles created by spontaneous scattering , preventing the formation of the condensate in the states with positive mass .",
    "however , the states with negative mass are on the contrary trapped in this potential , and serve as a seed for stimulated scattering .",
    "a second reason for the condensation of polaritons on top of the @xmath1 band is that the lifetime of anti - symmetric states is in general longer than that of the symmetric one  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the evanescent fraction of the mode outside the pillars is reduced for these modes due to the presence of the zeroes of the wavefunction at all junctions between the pillars , where there is a larger density of non - radiative centers that contribute to the lifetime reduction .",
    "this aspect favors the @xmath20 point of the @xmath1 band with respect to ( for example ) the @xmath20 points of the non - flat @xmath10 bands , which might also have negative mass , or with respect to the flat band , which possess much shorter lifetimes due to the location of the wavefunction lobes on the junctions between the pillars ( see fig .",
    "4(b ) of the main text ) .",
    "figure  [ figsimulcond](a ) shows the simulated emission from the condensate in the real space and fig .",
    "[ figsimulcond](c ) in the reciprocal space , in the absence of polariton - polariton interactions ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the simulation is in quantitative agreement with the experimental observations ( figs .",
    "3(b ) and  ( a ) , respectively ) , including the absence of emission from the @xmath20 point in the first brillouin zone due to interference effects .",
    "when varying the poition of the pump spot with respect to the center of the lattice , a very similar spatial and momentum space patterns are obtained .",
    "the spatial extension of the condensate coincides with that of the excitation spot that populates the reservoir . when interactions in the condensate become non - negligible compared to the interactions induced by the reservoir ( @xmath56 ) we expect the state to evolve into a gap soliton bound to the reservoir , as a consequence of the same mechanisms that have allowed its observation in a 1d periodic lattice for polaritons  @xcite .",
    "the increase of the polariton - polariton interaction term @xmath57 in the simulation leads to the shrinking of the spatial extension of the emission ( see fig .",
    "[ figsimulcond](b ) ) .",
    "even the smallest interactions within the condensate bring its energy up , further into the gap .",
    "the modification of the simulated transverse profile of the condensate corresponding to fig .",
    "[ figsimulcond](a , b ) ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsimulcond](d ) .",
    "limitation in the highest available excitation density in the experiment prevents us from seeing the expected modification in the spatial profile when the condensate evolves into a gap soliton .",
    "in order to confirm the phenomenological model used to describe the results reported in fig .  4 ,",
    "in which we assume that the tunnelling probability is energy dependent , we have performed a 2d schrdinger equation simulation for polaritons in the low density limit .",
    "since the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands are located close to the bottom of the lower polariton branch , we use the effective mass approximation :      here @xmath42 is the polariton mass , @xmath59ps is the polariton lifetime , and @xmath60 is the external potential describing the etched honeycomb lattice . in our simulation",
    "we use a rectangular sample made out of coupled micropillars of round geometry and same dimension as in the experiment , arranged in a lattice with 16 by 16 unit cells .",
    "the height of the polariton confining potential in the micropillars was taken 20  mev .",
    "the last term of the equation simulates a pulsed probe that will excite the different eigenstates of the schrdinger equation , thus allowing their visualization .",
    "@xmath23 is the amplitude of the probe , arriving at the sample at @xmath61 , @xmath62  ps is the pulse duration , @xmath63 m the spot size . using a short pulse and",
    "a small spot allows exciting several bands of the dispersion at the same time .",
    "@xmath64 is the pump location ( center of the sample , which does not correspond to the center of a particular pillar ) and @xmath65 is the pump central frequency , centered 4  mev above the bottom of the lower polariton branch to mainly excite the @xmath10 band multiplet .",
    "let us note that the probe pulse excites different parts of the dispersion with different efficiency , depending on their symmetry .",
    "the schrdinger equation is then integrated over time for 100  ps with a spatial grid 512x512 ( the size of the grid is @xmath66 m ) using a nvidia graphic card .",
    "the solution of the equation @xmath67 is then fourier - transformed over time and space to obtain the dispersion @xmath68 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ figepaps ] along the same momentum - space direction as in fig .",
    "4(a ) of the main text .",
    "the simulation is in excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental observation : the lowest @xmath10 band is indeed flat , while the upper band is dispersive .",
    "the full 2d model reproduces this behavior correctly , because it automatically takes into account the exponential increase with energy of the tunneling rate of the @xmath10 states of the individual pillars , as explained in the main text and illustrated by the tight - binding model calculations .",

    "<S> [ fig3](d ) ] , certifies that the system remains in the strong coupling regime across the threshold  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the emission spectrum collapses into a single emission line , and extended spatial coherence builds up . by monitoring the energy resolved emitted intensity across the condensation threshold , we observe that condensation takes place at the top of the @xmath1 band [ arrow in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the antibonding mode at the @xmath20 point favors condensation due to two features : ( _ i _ )  its negative effective mass and positive interaction energy , ( _ ii _ )  its longer lifetime , which stems from the antisymmetric character of the state  @xcite , and from the lower nonradiative recombination rate due to the vanishing polariton density at the constrictions between pillars , where the defect density is larger .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the two @xmath9 bands mimic the graphene @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands . </S>",
    "<S> but the honeycomb lattice contains more than those bands if higher orbital modes are available . in our lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between @xmath10 modes of the pillars leads to four energy bands which appear above the two @xmath9 bands , separated by a gap of about 0.7  mev [ see fig .  </S>",
