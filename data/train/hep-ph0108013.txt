    "recently the evidences of neutrino oscillations are strongly supported by both of the atmospheric  @xcite and the solar neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "the former suggests an almost maximal lepton flavor mixing between the 2nd and the 3rd generations , while the favorable solution to the solar neutrino deficits is given by large mixing angle solution between the 1st and the 2nd generations ( lma , low or vo )  @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments indicate that the neutrinos have tiny but finite masses , with two mass squared differences @xmath1 . since the neutrino mass is much smaller than other quarks and leptons , the origin of the neutrino mass is expected to be different from that of others .",
    "the most popular mechanism to induce the small neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite , which needs heavy right - handed neutrinos .",
    "however , it is important to consider also other possible scenarios which can explain the small neutrino masses , especially low - energy extensions of the standard model .",
    "the zee model  @xcite is such an alternative , which induces small neutrino masses by radiative corrections , where the lepton number is violated explicitly .",
    "generally , if there are lepton number violating interactions , care has to be taken for these interactions not to be too strong at the temperatures above the electroweak scale , since the baryon asymmetry generated in the early universe might be washed out by the `` sphaleron '' process  @xcite , which violates a linear combination of baryon ( @xmath2 ) and lepton ( @xmath3 ) number , @xmath4 .",
    "if the rate of the lepton number violating process becomes faster than the hubble expansion rate @xmath5 during the epoch when the sphaleron process is in thermal equilibrium , the baryon asymmetry generated at higher temperature would be washed out , and there would be no matter anti - matter asymmetry in the present universe , which conflicts with the observation .    in this letter , we analyze the cosmological condition in order for the baryon asymmetry generated in the early universe not to be washed out in the zee model .",
    "( we will not discuss the production mechanism of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "instead , we just assume that the desired amount of the baryon asymmetry is generated in the early universe and discuss whether or not this baryon asymmetry can be preserved against the lepton number violating interaction in the zee model together with the sphaleron process . ) in most part of the analysis , we take the low solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "( we shall note on the cases of other solutions in the last section . )",
    "we find that the baryon asymmetry is _ not _ washed out , although it has been said that the zee model can not preserve the baryon asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "this can be easily shown from the view point of a new lepton number @xmath0 .",
    "let us give a brief overview of the zee model  @xcite at first .",

    ", we have omitted the higgs potential @xmath14 which are irrelevant to the following discussion . as for the yukawa interaction , we assume only @xmath15 couples to lepton fields as , @xmath16 where @xmath17 . as can be seen from eqs .",

    "now let us turn to discuss the cosmological constraint on the zee model .",
    "a crucial point is that a linear combination of the lepton flavors , @xmath79 , is approximately conserved in the zee model .",

    "( [ hi-2 ] ) .",
    "( here , we assign the @xmath80 number of the zee singlet @xmath21 to be zero . )",
    "notice that the sphaleron preserves not only the total @xmath81 but each @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "thus , the number @xmath84 is also conserved under the sphaleron process , and is violated only by the tiny coupling @xmath63 .",
    "when the temperature @xmath85 is higher than the mass of @xmath21 , @xmath86 , the relevant interactions which violate @xmath80 are ; @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "we consider the three - body process @xmath90 , since it gives the severest constraint on the coupling @xmath63 . , the four - body process @xmath91 can give a severer constraint on @xmath63 than that of the above three - body process . in this case",
    ", we must take care the possibility that the condition @xmath92 might make the physical higgs masses , @xmath93 , be negative .",
    "if the condition @xmath94 and @xmath95 is satisfied , we can analyze the out - of - equilibrium condition of this four - body process in a similar way to the three - body case . however , the following conclusion does not change , since the coupling @xmath63 is suppressed by @xmath96 for @xmath97 [ see eq .",
    "( [ f_mutau ] ) ] and hence the out - of - equilibrium condition is satisfied more easily than the three - body case . ]",
    "the rate of this process is given by @xmath98 this @xmath80-violating interaction is out of equilibrium if the above rates is slower than the hubble parameter of the expanding universe , @xmath99 .",
    "( @xmath100 gev is the reduced planck scale and @xmath101 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom . )",
    "namely , the out - of - equilibrium condition is given by @xmath102 on the other hand , as discussed in the previous section , the coupling @xmath63 is very small in order to explain the neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "hereafter , we assume @xmath103 for simplicity . in this case",
    ", we could consider @xmath104 .",
    "then , from eqs .",
    "( [ zee_mass]),([mass_atm ] ) , and ( [ mass_sol ] ) , the coupling @xmath63 is given by @xmath105 where we take @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "( [ ooe - condition ] ) and ( [ f_mutau ] ) show that the @xmath80-violating interactions are really out of equilibrium during @xmath111 .",
    "this means that the baryon asymmetry is _ not _ washed out in the case of low solution .",
    "this result is not changed , unless @xmath86 is much heavier than @xmath112 or @xmath41 is extremely small .    at the lower temperature @xmath113",
    ", the rate of the three - body process is reduced because the number density of the @xmath21 particle is suppressed by a boltzmann factor @xmath114 , and the four - body interactions are also suppressed by a factor @xmath115 .    as we have seen in this section ,",
    "the @xmath80-violating interactions have been out of equilibrium since the birth of our universe .",
    "this is because @xmath63 must be small in order to explain the neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "actually , the analysis of chemical potentials in the high - temperature phase gives the following relation between the baryon asymmetry @xmath2 and the number @xmath116 ; @xmath117 therefore the baryon asymmetry in our universe can be preserved , once the asymmetry of @xmath116 is produced in the early universe .",
    "recent neutrino experiments indicate that neutrino masses are tiny and there are two mass squared differences as @xmath118 .",
    "it is well known that the zee model induces small neutrino masses by radiative corrections , where the lepton number is violated explicitly .",
    "if the lepton number violating interaction becomes faster than the hubble parameter before the electroweak phase transition , the baryon asymmetry generated at higher temperature ( in the early universe ) would be washed out .",
    "therefore , in order not to destroy the baryon asymmetry , the lepton number violating interaction must be out - of - equilibrium .",
    "in this letter we have analyzed the cosmological condition in order for the baryon asymmetry generated in the early universe not to be washed out in the zee model , taking the low solution to the solar neutrino problem . in this case",
    ", we find the baryon asymmetry is _ not _ washed out , although it has been said that the zee model can not preserve the baryon asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "this can be easily shown from the view point of the new lepton number @xmath0 .    the lepton number @xmath80 is almost conserved quantity which is violated only by the tiny coupling @xmath76 . from the viewpoint of @xmath80 ,",
    "the sphaleron process preserves @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath80 violating interaction through @xmath63 is out - of - equilibrium in the zee model when the results from neutrino - oscillation experiments and natural mass scales of higgs masses are used for the input parameters .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that once the asymmetry of @xmath119 is produced , the baryon asymmetry is preserved in our universe .",
    "we have shown that the baryon asymmetry is preserved against the lepton - number violating interaction in the zee model . however , it is very difficult to explain the origin of the asymmetry of @xmath84 within the zee model",
    ". therefore , some mechanism which can generate a @xmath84 asymmetry is necessary .",
    "finally , we comment on the cases of other solar neutrino solutions ( lma and vo ) .",
    "first , we consider the lma case .",
    "it has been pointed out  @xcite that the zee model could not explain the lma solution , since the zee model induces a nearly maximal mixing of solar - neutrino oscillation ( @xmath120 ) , which is in poor agreement with the observed data  @xcite .",
    "if one would still apply the present analysis to the lma solution , the out - of - equilibrium condition of @xmath80 violating interaction is marginally satisfied [ see eqs .",
    "( [ ooe - condition ] ) and ( [ f_mutau ] ) ] , although it requires a more detailed analysis including a numerical solution of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the second case is the vo solution . as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ f_mutau ] ) , the coupling @xmath63 which violates @xmath80 is proportional to the @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , in the case of the vo solution , where @xmath59 is much smaller than that of the low solution , the rate of the @xmath80-violating interaction is also small enough , and the baryon asymmetry is preserved as discussed in previous section .",
