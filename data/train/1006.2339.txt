    "in the field of complex plasmas  @xcite , one of the central problems is the problem of plasma shielding of charged objects ( dust grains ) immersed in plasma .",
    "one of the effects that influences the shielding is the effect of absorption of plasma particles by a grain , with the latter acting as a sink for plasma particles , creating a flux of electrons and ions from bulk plasma , via the shielding region , to the grain .",
    "these fluxes affect plasma far from the grain , preventing it from reaching an equilibrium with the grain field , and hence affecting the grain shielding by the plasma in a qualitative way , compared to a non - absorbing ( test ) charged grain .",
    "this qualitative effect of absorption on the screening is important for interaction of dust grains in dust clouds , clusters and crystals  @xcite , and for related phenomena such as phase transitions in complex plasma structures  @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown  @xcite that in an isotropic plasma the shielding of a grain ( that is at rest relative to the plasma ) is changed qualitatively if absorption of ions by the grain is taken into account : instead of debye - like potential at large distances from the grain , an @xmath0 tail appears in the potential , in case of collisionless plasmas .",
    "however , in reality the plasmas in which dust grains are immersed are usually anisotropic , e.g. , due to ion fluxes from bulk plasma to the plasma boundaries ( these can be dust - plasma boundaries such as in dust voids  @xcite ) , or due to the motion of dust grains relative to the plasma ( we note that the latter situation is equally relevant for satellites moving in the plasma environment of upper ionosphere  @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to investigate how absorption of plasma particles by a collecting body ( e.g. , a dust grain ) , either immersed in a flowing plasma , or moving in an isotropic plasma , affects the shielding of the body by the plasma .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the potential of a test ( non - absorbing ) charge , either moving in isotropic plasma or , equivalently , stationary in a flowing plasma , has an attractive part in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the flow ; in other words , two test charges of the same sign , placed sufficiently far from each other so that the line connecting them is perpendicular to the plasma flow direction , will attract each other electrostatically .",
    "this attraction may play a crucial role in formation and sustaining of plasma dust clusters and crystals  ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the attractive part appears due to the @xmath1 tail in the potential of the test charge far from the charge , which has the sign opposite to that of the test charge .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that , as in case of isotropic screening , absorption will lead to a @xmath0 tail in the potential , of the sign opposite to that of the @xmath1 tail of the test charge potential , which will dominate over the @xmath1 tail at large distances from the grain , and hence may either reduce or completely destroy the attractive part of the potential , qualitatively changing the interaction of grains perpendicularly to the flow direction .",
    "the effect of absorption on grain shielding in plasmas with a flow has so far only been studied using a hydrodynamic model in refs .",
    "it was demonstrated that , at least in the case of highly collisional plasmas considered there , the far asymptote of the grain field is dominated by the effect of absorption . however , it is yet not known how the absorption affects the grain shielding in plasmas with arbitrary degree of collisionality , in particular , in weakly collisional or collisionless plasmas . to answer this question , a kinetic model of grain shielding , accounting for the absorption , should be used . however , the kinetic model for shielding of grains in anisotropic plasma developed by ivlev  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , does not account for the absorption of ions by the grain .",
    "it is thus the aim of the present paper to study , using a kinetic model , the effect of absorption on grain shielding in the limiting case of collisionless flowing plasmas , thus covering the opposite limit of collisionality to that studied in  @xcite . in particular",
    ", we study here how the absorption affects the attractive part of the grain potential ( in the direction perpendicular to the anisotropy axis ) in collisionless plasmas .",
    "the answer to the latter question is important , e.g. , for feasibility of the experiment proposed by kompaneets  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite aimed at observing the attractive part of the grain potential in the direction perpendicular to the ion flow .",
    "we consider a small spherical absorbing body ( grain ) of charge @xmath2 , either moving in isotropic homogeneous collisionless plasma with velocity @xmath3 , or immersed in a homogeneous collisionless plasma with a uniform flow @xmath3 .",
    "stationary kinetic equation for ions in the reference frame of the grain is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the ion distribution function , @xmath6 is the self - consistent potential of the grain in plasma .",
    "the term on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of  ( [ eq : general_kinetic ] ) is the point - sink approximation of ion collection by the grain  @xcite , in which @xmath7 is the dirac delta - function , and @xmath8 is the ion collection cross - section of the body , which we assume to be isotropic , i.e. , independent of the direction of ion velocity and only depending on its absolute value , @xmath9 .",
    "the assumption of isotropic ion collection cross - section is valid as long as the field of the grain , in which the ions being collected by the grain move , is approximately central , i.e. , the anisotropy of the grain field in the flowing plasma is small in the region of size @xmath10 around the grain in which the trajectories of the ions being collected by the grain are significantly modified by its field .",
    "the rough criterion of validity of this approximation can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the characteristic length scale at which the anisotropy in shielding of the grain by plasma becomes significant .    in collisionless plasma @xmath8",
    "can be obtained from conservation of ion energy and angular momentum in the central field of the grain , and for small grains it is well approximated by the orbital motion limited ( oml ) theory  @xcite , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the surface potential of the grain , and @xmath15 is the grain radius .",
    "note that @xmath16 does not depend on the distribution of potential in the viccinity of the grain .",
    "this is another reason for using the isotropic approximation @xmath9 for ion absorption by the grain .",
    "plasma electrons are assumed to be boltzmann distributed , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the unperturbed plasma density ( @xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 is the electron temperature in energy units . the electron flux absorbed by the grain is assumed to compensate the absorbed ion flux , so that the grain charge @xmath2 remains constant .",
    "the set is coupled by the poisson s equation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ion number density , and @xmath23 approximates the charge density of the ( small ) grain , which is located at @xmath24 .",
    "this delta - function approximation is well justified when the grain size is small compared to the effective length scale of plasma screening .",
    "we employ the linear response formalism to find the static potential @xmath25 induced in the plasma by the absorbing charged grain . in the absence of the grain , the plasma is assumed homogeneous and quasineutral , with no electric field ( @xmath26 ) , and the ion distribution function @xmath27 .",
    "the grain perturbs the plasma , inducing an electric field @xmath28 in the plasma , and perturbing the distribution functions of ions , @xmath29 . assuming this perturbation to be small , @xmath30 , we linearize  eqs  ( [ eq : general_kinetic])([eq : poisson_general ] ) ,",

    "typical parameters  @xcite relevant to the case of superthermal ion flows considered here ( e.g. , experiments in which dust grains are suspended against gravity in plasma sheath region with superthermal ion flow ) are : @xmath164 ( see appendix  [ app : estimate_z_super ] ) , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 ( here @xmath167 is the bohm velocity of ions in the sheath , which is equal to the ion sound velocity @xmath168 , and thus @xmath169 ) .",

    "we therefore conclude that for typical conditions of earth - based dusty plasma experiments in which dust grains are suspended in the sheath region of the discharge with superthermal ion flow , it is safe to neglect the effect of absorption of ions on the grain when calculating the potential of the grain in plasma , and just to use the expressions ( [ eq : phi_q_super_1])-([eq : phi_q_super_2 ] ) for the potential of the test ( non - absorbing ) charge . only for very large grains , @xmath172 , suspended in a sheath plasma with superthermal ion flow , one should account for the effect of absorption on the grain potential , given by eqs  ( [ eq : phi_abs_super_1])-([eq : phi_abs_super_2 ] ) .",

    "the total grain potential @xmath173 is calculated using the linear perturbation analysis , therefore the validity of the obtained expressions for the potential is limited to the region where the nonlinear effects are negligible , i.e. , to distances sufficiently far away from the grain , such that the absolute value of the potential energy of ions in the grain field @xmath174 is small compared to their characteristic kinetic energy @xmath175 . in the region near the grain where the potential energy of ions in the field of the grain becomes comparable to their characteristic kinetic energy , @xmath176 ,",

    "@xmath8 does not depend on the distribution of the grain potential in the vicinity of the grain , we do not expect a significant effect of the grain field anisotropy on the process of ion absorption on the grain , and hence on the derived absorption - induced term @xmath68 in the grain potential .    in case of superthermal ion flows ,",
    "we use ( [ eq : sigma_criterion_gen ] ) with @xmath222 , @xmath223 , which gives us the following criterion of validity of the isotropic approximation for ion absorption on the grain : @xmath224 for @xmath164 , @xmath225 , and @xmath208 , this condition is well satisfied ( and hence the isotropic approximation is valid ) for all grain sizes from the typical range @xmath226  @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the approximation of isotropic cross - section of ion absorption on the grain is well justified for typical grain sizes relevant to complex plasmas .",
    "the model used in this paper is collisionless , but it can in principle be generalized to include ion - neutral collisions , which are typically the most frequent collisions in complex plasmas  @xcite .",
    "the effect of ion - neutral collisions will most probably modify the results obtained here , as the collisions lead to an @xmath0 tail in the shielding potential of a test ( non - absorbing ) grain in drifting plasmas  @xcite , and to an @xmath227 tail in the shielding potential of an absorbing grain in isotropic plasmas  @xcite or drifting strongly collisional plasmas  @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the kinetic model with absorption used in this work , to include collisions , and the study of the effect of absorption on shielding of dust grains in flowing plasmas with arbitrary degree of ion - neutral collisionality , are left for future work .",
    "in this work we obtained the shielding potential of an absorbing charged grain , which is either moving in a uniform collisionless plasma , or is immersed in a collisionless plasma with a uniform flow , employing linear perturbation analysis of the kinetic equation for ions with point - sink term accounting for the absorption of ions by the grain .",
    "the total potential of the grain in plasma is shown to consist of two independent terms : the term @xmath67 due to the grain charge , and the term @xmath68 due to absorption of plasma ions by the grain .",
    "having obtained the general expression for the absorption - induced term @xmath68 , we analyzed analytically its effect on the grain shielding in the limits of sub- and superthermal ion flows .",
    "it has been shown that , in general , absorption leads to a qualitative change in the far field of the grain from a quadupole - like field of a non - absorbing ( test ) charge to a dipole - like field of the absorbing grain .",
    "the characteristic distance from the grain at which this change occurs is obtained in the limits of subthermal and superthermal ion flow in terms of the plasma parameters and the grain size .",
    "this distance varies depending on the direction relative to the direction of the flow , and so does the effect of absorption - induced correction @xmath68 to the grain shielding potential .",
    "the most important absorption - induced effect on the grain shielding is the effect on the attractive part of the grain potential in the direction perpendicular to the flow , that has been previously demonstrated to appear for a test ( non - absorbing ) charged grain  @xcite , and which is important for the grain interaction in structures ( e.g. , dust clusters and crystals ) in complex plasmas .    in the limit of subthermal flows ,",
    "the absorption of ions by the grain is shown to significantly modify this attractive part of the grain potential .",
    "the character and magnitude of this modification depends on the plasma parameters and the grain size .",
    "the quantitative criterion is derived which defines , for given plasma parameters and grain sizes , how the absorption modifies the attractive part of the grain potential : whether it makes the attractive potential well more shallow , thus making the attraction weaker and reducing the associated melting temperature  of the dust structure in the plane orthogonal to the flow direction , or whether it destroys the attractive part of the grain completely .",
    "our estimates show that in the subthermal limit @xmath46 the effect of absorption on the attractive part of the grain potential is significant for all of the typical grain sizes @xmath228 relevant to complex plasmas .",
    "in particular , we found that in case of subthermal flow the absorption significantly reduces the attractive part of the grain potential for the smallest of the typical grains , @xmath229 , while completely destroying it for grains larger than @xmath230 .",
    "one should thus account for the effect of ion absorption on the grain in plasmas with subthermal ion flow , if one is interested in the effects associated with the asymptotic behavior of the grain potential in the direction perpendicular to the flow , e.g. , interaction of grains and phase transitions in dust crystals and clusters in the plane orthogonal to the ion flow .    in the limit of superthermal flows",
    ", however , the situation is different from that of the limit of subthermal flows : the absorption can only slightly modify the attractive part of the grain potential in the direction perpendicular to the ion flow , but can not destroy it , for any grain size .",
    "moreover , for typical parameters and grain sizes relevant to complex plasma experiments where dust grains are levitated in the sheath region , the minimum distance at which the absorption - induced change from the quadrupole to the dipole field occurs is so large compared to the characteristic screening length @xmath231 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdip_lambda_super ] ) ] , that the grain field at this distance is practically shielded completely , or at least is shielded to the level where it is overwhelmed by random plasma noise fields .",
    "therefore , in case of superthermal ion flows , the effect of absorption on the grain shielding potential can be safely ignored for typical grain sizes @xmath171 occuring in complex plasmas .",
