    "the observations of high - redshift qso s @xcite and large - scale cmb polarization @xcite indicate that the intergalactic medium has been completely ionized by redshift @xmath4 through an extended process .",
    "the most probable cause was the ionizing radiation of the first stars and qso s .",
    "currently these are the two main direct observational constraints on this epoch .",
    "this scarcity of observational data is set to change dramatically in the next few years , however .",
    "a number of large observational projects are currently under way , e.g. observations at the redshifted 21-cm line of hydrogen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , detection of small - scale cmb anisotropies due to the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and surveys of high - redshift ly-@xmath1 emitters and studies of the igm absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the planning and success of these experiments relies critically upon understanding the large - scale geometry of reionization , i.e. the size- and spatial distribution of the ionized and neutral patches .",
    "this is best derived by large - scale simulations , although a number of semi - analytical models exist as well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recently we presented the first large - scale , high - resolution radiative transfer simulations of cosmic reionization @xcite and applied those to derive a range of reionization observables @xcite . here",
    "we summarize recent results on the characteristic scales and topology of reionization and implications of our simulations for the observability of high - redshift ly-@xmath1 sources .",
    "sources at redshift @xmath2 : luminosity function without ( black ) and with absorption included ( red ) . for reference ,",
    "the green , dotted line shows the result suppressing each source by 50% , which would be the case if e.g. all of the blue wing of the emission line , but none of the red wing is absorbed .",
    "[ lum ] ]    the characteristic scales of the ionization and density fluctuations are directly imprinted in the fluctuations of all reionization observables ( fig .  [ pencil ] ) .",
    "it is thus critical to understand what these scales are and their dependences on the ( still not yet well - known ) reionization parameters .",
    "we investigated the dependence of the characteristic sizes of ionized and neutral patches on some basic properties of the sources of reionization and the intergalactic medium , such as the halo mass - to - light ratio , susceptibility of haloes to positive and negative feedback , and the gas clumping at small scales .",
    "we used two independent methods for identifying the size distribution of patches , the friends - of - friends ( fof ) method @xcite , where all topologically - connected ionized regions are considered as one region , and the spherical average method @xcite , where an averaging over a spherical region and an ionization threshold are used to define the size . in the fof method , throughout most of the evolution there is one very large connected region in which most of the volume is contained . for the spherical average method ,",
    "the bubble distribution typically peaks on mpc scales .",
    "suppression of ionizing sources within ionized regions and gas clumping both reduce the size and increase the number of h  ii regions , although the effect is modest , reducing the typical radius of h  ii regions by factors of at most a few ( fig .",
    "[ scales ] ) .",
    "we also found that density and ionized fraction are correlated on large scales , regardless of the degree of clumping and suppression .",
    "the genus of the ionization field proved to be much more sensitive to suppression and clumping than the size distributions or the power spectra and could thus be used for more detailed characterization of the reionization parameters .",
    "we will present these results in detail in an upcoming paper ( alvarez et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "observations of the high - redshift ly-@xmath1 sources have provided us with a wealth of information about the state of the igm and the nature of the galaxies at the end of reionization and hold even more promise for the future .",
    "in addition to probing the igm and the source luminosity function ( and thus , indirectly , the halo mass function and ionization source properties ) , they may also be used to constrain the reionization topology @xcite .",
    "the first rare objects form in the highest peaks of the density field .",
    "the statistics of gaussian fields predicts that such peaks are strongly clustered at high redshift .",
    "hence each high - redshift , massive galaxy was surrounded by numerous smaller ionizing sources .",
    "the self - consistent simulations of such regions require following a large volume while also resolving the low - mass halos driving reionization .    in figure  [ peak_evol ]",
    "we illustrate several stages of the reionization history of a high density peak .",
    "the most massive source in our volume ( at @xmath5 ) is shifted to the centre using the periodicity of the computational box . at redshift",
    "@xmath6 the source is invisible due to the damping wing from the neutral gas outside the small h  ii region . by redshift",
    "@xmath7 many more haloes have formed , most of them in large clustered groups .",
    "the h  ii region surrounding the central peak is among the largest , but the central source emission remains strongly affected by damping . only by redshift",
    "@xmath8 the ionized region is large enough to render the source potentially visible .",
    "the reionization geometry becomes quite complex , most ionized bubbles are interconnected , but large neutral patches remain between them , which is also showing in the topological characteristics of the filed like the genus discussed above . finally , by the nominal overlap @xmath9",
    "all ionized regions have merged into one topologically - connected region , although substantial neutral patches remain interspersed throughout our volume , which is still largely optically - thick to both ly-@xmath1 and ionizing radiation . only by @xmath4",
    "this volume becomes on average optically - thin to ionizing radiation .    in figure  [ spectra2 ]",
    "we show some sample absorption spectra for the same luminous source . the spectra exhibit extended high - transmission ( 10 - 60% transmission ) regions in the highly - ionized proximity zone of the luminous source , within 5  mpc@xmath10",
    "( @xmath11   ) .",
    "the center of the peak itself is optically - thick due to its high density .",
    "the infall around the central peak blue - shifts photons , resulting in some transmission behind the redshift - space position of the source .",
    "away from the proximity region the absorption is largely saturated , but there are a number of transmission gaps with up to a few per cent transmission . in figure  [ lum ]",
    "we show the ly-@xmath1 source luminosity function at the same redshift . for the weaker sources",
    "roughly half of the intrinsic luminosity is transmitted ( the red wing of the line ) , while the most luminous sources suffer from additional absorption due to the gas infall that surrounds them .",
    "future work will quantify the statistics of these features and its evolution ."
