    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the most general superpotential consistent with gauge invariance and renormalizability is given by @xmath9 it is useful to assign a matter parity to the superfields , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , @xmath12 the baryon and lepton number , respectively . under matter parity the quark and lepton superfields have charge @xmath13 and the higgs superfields have charge + 1 .",
    "r - parity is then defined on the spin @xmath14 component fields as @xmath15 , under which all of the sm fields are even and the superpartners are odd .",

    ". such a coupling must be at least larger than @xmath21 to mediate a decay on detector scales . if there are also , _",
    "e.g. , _ @xmath22 couplings @xmath17 present at some level , then squark exchange will mediate the decay of the proton with a lifetime @xmath23 we see that to get interesting modifications to susy collider signatures from @xmath1 , we must require @xmath22 to be extremely suppressed to avoid rapid proton decay .",
    "this is another way of saying that one can have @xmath11 or @xmath12 violation , but not both .",
    "besides proton decay , there are a variety of additional strong constraints on rpv couplings ; for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the problem is even worse than this ",
    "one could imagine for example that sizable rpv couplings exist only amongst the second and third generation .",
    "however , as a result of electroweak symmetry breaking rotations from the gauge to the mass basis will generally induce sizable coupling amongst the first two generations . clearly , it is therefore desirable to have a symmetry explanation for the suppression of dangerous rpv couplings .",
    "minimal flavor violation provides one such symmetry principle to explain the smallness of unwanted rpv couplings .",
    "the mfv hypothesis promotes the yukawa couplings to spurion fields transforming under the nonabelian flavor symmetry @xmath24 .",
    "it is assumed that these spurions are the only source of @xmath25 breaking .",
    "this assumption typically is imposed in any case of the soft breaking squark masses and trilinear scalar couplings to suppress fcncs .",
    "since the rpv couplings in the superpotential contain the quark and lepton fields , it is then natural to ask what constraints mfv places on the size of rpv couplings . this question has been addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite which have shown that mfv suppresses rpv couplings enough to explain the stability of the proton , while generating neutrino masses and being consistent with @xmath26 oscillation and dinucleon decay constraints .",
    "the primary difference in approach between  @xcite and @xcite is that the latter imposes holomorphicity on the yukawa spurions , which is required if one imagines the yukawas to arise from the vacuum expectation values of chiral superfields in a uv completion .",
    "this assumption drastically reduces the number of allowed couplings in the superpotential , thus leading to a more predictive setup . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we follow  @xcite and impose holomorphy on the yukawa spurions .",
    "in fact , in the limit of massless neutrinos , mfv allows only one operator in the superpotential  @xcite : @xmath27 where the effective @xmath1 coupling is given by @xmath28 one clearly observes the strong yukawa and ckm suppression in the effective couplings @xmath18 amongst the first and second generation fields . at the same time , the coupling @xmath29 , though also suppressed , is still large enough to cause the lsp to decay within the lhc detectors .",
    "for example , with an @xmath30 mfv coupling @xmath31 , one obtains @xmath32 .    with massless neutrinos , the baryon number violating operator in eq .",
    "( [ wbaryon ] ) is the only superpotential coupling allowed .",
    "additional lepton number violating couplings could in principle arise from the k@xmath33hler potential which has no constraints from holomorphicity",
    ". however , only @xmath34 operators are in fact allowed due to an accidental @xmath35 symmetry present in the theory .",
    "such operators can only occur at the nonrenormalizable level , and are suppressed .",
    "thus the proton is safely stable in the limit of massless neutrinos .",
    "it is straightforward to incorporate neutrino masses into the theory , which allows for additional sources of lepton number violation , but mfv still can safely suppress proton decay and be consistent with various other rpv constraints  @xcite .",
    "the collider signatures of mfv susy depend primarily on the nature of the lsp .",
    "the third generation squarks , due to their large yukawa couplings , can easily be split from those of the first and second generation .",
    "it is therefore possible that the stop or the sbottom is the lsp .",
    "a stop lsp will decay due to the interaction in eq .",
    "( [ wbaryon ] ) via @xmath36 , while a sbottom lsp can decay similarly via @xmath37 .",
    "these decays are prompt ( except perhaps for the sbottom at low @xmath38 )",
    ". other possible lsps , such as neutralinos , charginos , or gluinos can easily leave displaced vertices , as they will decay , _ e.g. , _ through an offshell stop or sbottom .",
    "such signatures are very distinctive , although presently the limits are not very strong . for",
    "further studies of the collider phenomenology in mfv susy , see refs .",
    "we have seen that mfv susy provides an attractive framework to explain the proton stability in supersymmetric theories with rpv . by design",
    ", the lsp will decay with a very short lifetime such that susy collider events have suppressed missing energy .",
    "therefore , there is no wimp dm candidate amongst the superpartners of the sm particles .",
    "this is of course true of any scenario with rpv couplings large enough to hide susy at the lhc .",
    "therefore , one must look beyond the rpv mssm if one takes the wimp miracle seriously .    despite the fact that mfv susy does not contain a wimp candidate , mfv itself provides a motivation for dm , as we now discuss . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the mfv hypothesis implies absolute stability for certain representations that transform nontrivially under the quark flavor group @xmath39 and are singlets under @xmath40 .",
    "if these states are also electrically neutral , they make excellent dark matter candidates .    in ref .",
    "@xcite dm stability was demonstrated through an operator analysis .",
    "conditions were derived for the existence of the most general operator composed of a single dm multiplet , sm fields and yukawa spurions that would mediate the decay of the would - be dm particle if present . here",
    "we wish to revisit this question from a symmetry perspective .",
    "we will show that dm stability can be traced to the presence of an accidental @xmath4 symmetry , which we call _ flavor triality _",
    ", that is present under the assumption of mfv .",
    "it is in fact very simple to see that an accidental symmetry is present that can stabilize dm .",
    "consider the following discrete @xmath4 transformation which is an element of @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and the subscript indicates the group which contains the corresponding @xmath4 element .",
    "using the representations listed in table  [ tab : reps ] , one can easily check that _ all _ of the sm fields and yukawa spurions transform trivially under ( [ transformationa ] ) .",
    "for example , under ( [ transformationa ] ) @xmath44 , @xmath45 , etc .    .",
    "representations of fields charged under @xmath46 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now consider a new matter multiplet @xmath47 which is to be our dm candidate .",
    "this field is a color singlet ( as dm is both color and electrically neutral ) and transforms under @xmath3 with irreducible representation @xmath48 where we have used tensorial notation with @xmath49 etc . taking possible values @xmath50 . under the @xmath4 transformation ( [ transformationa ] ) ,",
    "@xmath47 transforms as @xmath51 where we have defined @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "thus , @xmath47 will transform nontrivially under ( [ transformationa ] ) provided the following condition is met : @xmath54 since the sm fields and yukawa spurions transform trivially under the @xmath4 transformation , provided the condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) is met , @xmath47 transforms nontrivially and will therefore be absolutely stable .",
    "we will use the term _ flavor triality _ to refer to this @xmath4 symmetry under which dm is charged and the sm is neutral .",
    "examples of @xmath3 representations for which ( [ eq : cond ] ) holds are flavor triplets , ( _ e.g. , _ @xmath55 etc . ) ,",
    "sextets , ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xmath56 etc . ) and certain mixed representations , ( _ e.g. , _ @xmath57 etc . ) . on the other hand flavor singlets , octets and certain mixed representations , ( _ e.g. , _ @xmath58 etc",
    ") do not meet [ eq : cond ] .",
    "we wish to emphasize that flavor triality does not require susy ; it is simply a consequence of mfv .",
    "provided we strictly enforce mfv , the conclusion is that the dark matter candidate @xmath47 is exactly stable if ( [ eq : cond ] ) holds , even in the presence of arbitrary higher dimension operators .",
    "a natural question is whether stability holds in the presence of deviations from mfv . without reference to a concrete uv completion ,",
    "perhaps the most sensible way to parametrize deviations from the mfv hypothesis is to consider additional spurions that break flavor .",
    "provided that these new spurions transform trivially under flavor triality , then dm stability will not be spoiled .",
    "for example , additional spurions transforming like the sm yukawas or , _",
    "e.g. , _ as flavor octets will not cause the decay of the dm .",
    "the sm flavor symmetries are anomalous , so one may worry that flavor triality is broken at the quantum level .",
    "an attractive possibility is that the sm flavor symmetries are gauged in the uv , which ultimately implies the presence of additional matter that would render the theory anomaly free .",
    "flavor triality would then fundamentally be a discrete gauge symmetry and could not be spoiled by quantum gravitational effects  @xcite .",
    "this possibility is similar in spirit to obtaining r - parity from broken gauged",
    "@xmath59  @xcite .",
    "finally , we wish to comment on the possibility of lepton - flavored dark matter .",
    "recall that the stability of quark - flavored dark matter considered above rests on the fact that the quark fields transform trivially under the element ( [ transformationa ] ) of @xmath60 .",
    "this is a consequence of the @xmath40 charge of the quark fields .",
    "however , since the leptons are not colored , there is no transformation analogous to ( [ transformationa ] ) under which the lepton fields transform trivially",
    ". therefore , mfv does not in general imply stability for lepton - flavored dark matter .",
    "with the stability condition ( [ eq : cond ] ) we are now in a position to consider explicit models of flavored dm within the framework of mfv susy . with only the addition of a dm multiplet , interactions between the dm and mssm fields are not possible at the renormalizable level .",
    "one could consider effective theories of flavored dm , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in such theories one can not address important questions relevant for supersymmetric theories such as gauge coupling unification .",
    "renormalizable theories require an additional mediator field that couples dm to the mssm fields .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite for renormalizable fdm models in non - supersymmetric setups .",
    "the basic models of sfdm contain a vector - like dm multiplet @xmath61 , @xmath62 and a vector - like mediator field @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the superpotential is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is one of the quark fields @xmath67 , @xmath68 , or @xmath69 .",
    "for simplicity we will restrict our discussion to models in which @xmath61 is a flavor triplet and sm gauge singlet , while @xmath63 is a flavor singlet and carries sm gauge charges , but of course other possibilities exist .",
    "one of the main differences between non - supersymmetric theories of fdm and sfdm is the constraint that holomorphy places on the superpotential mass and coupling parameters .",
    "no further yukawa insertions are allowed in the superpotential , which naively leads one to expect that the masses and couplings of the individual flavors of @xmath61 are not split .",
    "obviously this constraint is not present in non - supersymmetric theories .",
    "however , as we will see below , non - holomorphic terms in the k@xmath70hler potential can lead to large flavor splittings , which will be important for phenomenology .",
    "[ [ the - mediator - y ] ] * the mediator @xmath63 * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the mediator @xmath63 will generally be charged under the gauge group of the sm , and will therefore typically ruin gauge coupling unification . to avoid this ,",
    "we can embed @xmath63 , @xmath71 in a complete su(5 ) multiplet .",
    "for example , if @xmath72 , then one can embed @xmath63 into a @xmath73 which allows the coupling @xmath74 .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath75 or @xmath76 , we can embed @xmath63 in a @xmath77 , which allows couplings to @xmath67 or @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "thus , our framework is compatible with gauge coupling unification .",
    "[ [ sec : soft ] ] * flavor splittings * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as mentioned above , the masses and couplings of the individual flavors are degenerate at the level of the renormalizable superpotential due to holomorphy of the yukawa spurions .",
    "however , there are several ways by which flavor splittings can be induced as we now discuss .",
    "there is no holomorphy constraint on the k@xmath70hler potential , which may contain additional yukawa insertions that are consistent with the flavor symmetry .",
    "the kinetic term need not be canonical , _ e.g. _ , @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 are matrices in flavor space which contain yukawa insertions .",
    "for example , if @xmath76 , we have @xmath81 where we have written explicitly the leading yukawa insertion .",
    "if the mfv couplings @xmath82 , @xmath83 are @xmath84 , this can lead to a sizable splitting between the masses and physical couplings of the third and first two generations of flavors after canonical normalization of the kinetic term is carried out .",
    "another important effect comes from susy breaking terms in the k@xmath70hler potential , which can generate _ effective _ non - holomorphic mass terms in the superpotential , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a spurion parameterizing susy breaking , with @xmath87 the susy breaking scale and @xmath88 the messenger scale .",
    "since it originates in the k@xmath70hler potential , the coupling @xmath89 need not be holomorphic , _ e.g. _ , for @xmath76 , we have @xmath90 where again we have written explicitly the leading yukawa insertion and @xmath91 , @xmath92 are @xmath84 mfv couplings .",
    "these two effects , eqs .",
    "( [ kinetic ] ) and ( [ effectivesuper ] ) , are enough to generate large splittings in the masses and couplings between the top flavor and up and charm flavors , in the example @xmath76 .",
    "typically , up - type yukawa insertions will lead to a bigger splittings , although this is not necessarily true at large @xmath38 since the bottom yukawa coupling can be @xmath84 .",

    "we will focus here on the case of a stop lsp .",
    "provided the stop is lighter than the dm @xmath121 ( more specifically @xmath189 ) , then it will decay via the baryon number violating vertex ( [ wbaryon ] ) : @xmath190 stops decaying via ( [ stopdecay ] ) are not constrained by existing searches for paired dijet resonances  @xcite .",
    "the dm @xmath121 is of course stable and will lead to @xmath191 if produced .",
    "there are several ways in which @xmath121 can be produced , as we now discuss .",
    "for example , the scalar mediator @xmath124 , being colored , can be pair produced through strong interactions .",
    "once produced , it will decay via @xmath192 resulting in a signature of @xmath193 for @xmath124 pair production .",
    "remarkably , @xmath124 acts as a `` fake stop '' , in that the signature of @xmath124 pair production mimics exactly the signature of stop pair production in standard rpc scenarios when the stop decays to a top and a stable neutralino lsp .",
    "the limits ( and projected reach ) on direct stop pair production from cms @xcite and atlas@xcite can thus be directly applied to the case of @xmath124 production and are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] .",
    "another channel which is important is pair production the fermionic mediator @xmath125 , which will decay via @xmath194 if the lsp is mostly right handed stop , @xmath195 , then @xmath125 will decay primarily to the stop lsp and the dm @xmath121 .",

    "this signature is similar , though not identical , to gluino pair production followed by @xmath197 mediated by a heavy off - shell squark in standard rpc scenarios .",
    "the gluino searches using data from the 7 tev run provide the strongest limits on @xmath125 pair production .",
    "this is because the recent 8 tev analyses are optimized for a high mass gluino , which , being a color octet , has a much larger production cross section then the color triplet @xmath125 in our scenario .",
    "the atlas search  @xcite probes @xmath198 gev for @xmath199 gev , @xmath200 gev . if the dm @xmath121 is lighter , then the sensitivity can be extended up to higher masses ( of order 800 gev for massless @xmath121 ) , although in this range new annihilation channels are required to obtain a viable cosmology .    if the new states in the flavored dark sector lie below the mssm superpartners , particularly the gluino and first and second generation squarks , additional signatures are possible .",

    ", for the case of a thermal relic @xmath121 considered here , the required @xmath84 coupling @xmath160 implies that the new states @xmath121 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 can not be too heavy without a significant tuning of the weak scale .",
    "the level of tuning induced by these states is similar to that of the gluino , which also contributes to the higgs mass at two loops .",
    "however , in comparison to the gluino in the mssm with rpc , the lhc limits on the @xmath124 and @xmath125 are generically much weaker , as discussed above .",
    "supersymmetry with r - parity violation is only weakly constrained by searches at the lhc , particularly if the lsp decays to jets through the @xmath1 operator . however , with rpv one abandons a symmetry rationale for the proton stability and the wimp miracle .",
