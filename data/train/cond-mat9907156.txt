    "the tradition of analyzing material targets from the energy - loss spectroscopy of charged particles scattered through or near a scatter has continued to enrich physics over the past several decades .",
    "applications have been found in nuclear and particle physics , atomic and molecular physics , and in condensed - matter physics .",
    "recently , biological physics has benefited as well , particularly from the use of electron - energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) performed using scanning - transmission - electron microscopes ( stem ) .",
    "using a stem one can obtain information on the size , shape , composition , and location of isolated particulates embedded in a host material ( composite ) and thus obtain three - dimensional chemical maps with high resolution ( chen _ et al _ 1986 ) .    in a typical stem configuration ,",
    "a well - focused 0.5-nm probe of 50 - 100 kev electrons provides a high - resolution transmission scanning image for samples with complex structures .",
    "it also yields from selected regions of the structure , x - ray emission spectra and electron energy - loss spectra .",
    "quantitative theories have been developed to analyze the experimental energy - loss spectra in some simple cases .",
    "solutions , within the classical dielectric theory , have been worked out for a number of cases involving planar interfaces ( echenique and pendry 1975 ) , spheres ( ferrel and echenique 1985 , echenique _ et al _ 1987 ) , cylinders ( walsh 1989 , zabala _ et al _ 1989 ) , spheroids ( illman _ et al _ 1988 ) , and parabolically shaped wedges ( garcia - molina _",
    "et al _ 1985 ) .",
    "for these simple geometries , experimental results show that dielectric excitation theory is capable of predicting energy - loss spectra , allowing a fully consistent dielectric characterization of an interface or a small particle ( walls and howie 1989 , rivacoba _ et al _ 1992 ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on the calculation of excitation probability for point charge particle moving parallel to the sharp - edged dielectric wedge whose boundary is formed by the intersection of two semi - infinite planes making an interior angle of @xmath0 .",
    "our interest is explained by some experiments that were reported in ( marks 1982 , cowley 1982 , wheatley _",
    "et al _ 1983 ) .",
    "the targets ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , etc . ) bombarded in the experiments are of cubic symmetry ( i.e. have sharp - edged form ) , about 20 - 200 nm in size , and the electron beam is oriented along the principal crystallographic directions .",
    "marks ( 1982 ) have measured the spectra of energy - losses of electron beams interacting with small crystallites of @xmath1 .",
    "the calculations for excitation probability were done considering the crystallites as semi - infinite surface related to electron beams . using the classical theory of impact - parameter - dependent energy losses for planar interfaces",
    "wheatley _ et al _ ( 1983 ) applied the planar results for spheres while resolving the force in the track direction .",
    "garcia - molina _",
    "et al _ ( 1985 ) calculated the energy - loss function and the excitation probability of the wedge modes due to a pointlike electron beam moving parallel to the dielectric wedge surface with a parabolic - cylinder boundary .    here",
    "we shall calculate the excitation probability of sharp - edged modes , due to an electron beam passing parallel to the dielectric wedge with a local , but otherwise arbitrary , dielectric function @xmath4 .",
    "we shall limit our calculations to the nonretarded limit .",
    "the limiting cases for the potential and excitation probability are shown .",
    "first , from exact expressions for excitation probability we derive the expressions for planar geometry in the limiting case of @xmath5 .",
    "second , in appendix we also show that in the static limit ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the velocity of particle ) from our results for the potential follows the expression for conducting sharp - edged wedge ( @xmath8 ) ( landau and lifshitz 1982 ) . in sec .",
    "iii we have utilized available bulk optical data ( roessler and walker 1967 ) to calculate the differential energy - loss probability for @xmath1 .",
    "the theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data , and it is shown that the main features of the experiments reported by marks ( 1982 ) can be explained by the theory . also , our results are compared with a parabolically shaped wedge ( garcia - molina _ et al _ 1985 ) . in sec .",
    "iv we present our conclusions and comments on the results and discuss opportunities for possible future work .",
    "take dielectric wedges whose boundaries are formed by the intersection of two semi - infinite planes making an interior angle of @xmath0 infinite in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "let in the cylindrical system of coordinates @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath9 the azymutal angle @xmath12 is measured from one of wedges sides .",
    "we consider two media filling the spaces @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and characterized by an isotropic dielectric functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively ( see figure 1 ) . the incident charged particle with the charge @xmath18 moves with a velocity @xmath7 directed along the @xmath9 axis and has the following coordinates @xmath19 @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 .",
    "the study of the electrostatic edge modes along a sharp - edged wedge is due to dobrzynsky and maradudin ( 1972 ) , who solved laplace s equation in the appropriate coordinate system .",
    "davis ( 1976 ) has considered the electrostatic modes of a hyperbolic cylinder and has concluded that the results in the work of dobrzynsky and maradudin ( 1972 ) are associated with the sharpness of the edge of the wedge . here we shall only give the main steps in the derivation of the electrostatic potential originated as a result of an electron beam traveling along the wedges surfaces .",
    "we solve poisson s equation for the potential    @xmath23    where the charge density associated with an electron beam , which is described classically by a @xmath24 functions , @xmath25 is the operator of dielectric permeability of the medium ( landau and lifshitz 1982 ) .",

    "we seek the dissipative component of the force acting on the beam moving near the wedge surface .",
    "we neglect quantum recoil effects and assume that @xmath7 is constant ( i.e. , the external charge acts as an infinite source of energy and momentum ) .",

    "note that this definition of @xmath53 is valid when charged particle beam is sufficiently fast , i.e. @xmath54cm / sec . as expected , the excitation probability in equation ( 11 ) contains terms corresponding to both the excitation of the bulk ( the term @xmath55 ) and of the surface modes of the wedge . therefore ,",
    "if one wishes to probe the surface excitation field , without interference from the bulk modes , the probe has to be kept external to the wedge , as was done in the experiments ( marks 1982 , cowley 1982 , wheatley _",
    "et al _ 1983 ) .",
    "one can calculate the specific energy loss from equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "the dispersion relation for the surface modes is the result of equating the denominator in equation ( 12 ) to zero . as it follows from the expression ( 12 )",

    "we consider first the case of a beam travelling external to the wedge , in vacuum ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) .",

    "it is instructive to derive from equations ( 16 ) and ( 19 ) the excitation probability quoted by marks ( 1982 ) for an electron beam traveling parallel to a semi - infinite dielectric occuping the region @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) , and at a distance @xmath73 from its surface . substituting @xmath5 in the equations ( 16 ) and ( 19 ) we find    @xmath74 \\int_0^\\infty d\\mu k_{i\\mu } ^2\\left ( \\frac \\omega ua\\right ) { \\rm ch}\\left [ \\mu ( \\pi -2\\gamma ) \\right ] , \\ ] ]    when @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and    @xmath75 \\int_0^\\infty d\\mu k_{i\\mu } ^2\\left ( \\frac \\omega ua\\right ) { \\rm ch}\\left [ \\mu ( \\pi -2\\gamma ) \\right ] \\right\\ } , \\ ] ]    when @xmath56 , @xmath76 . for calculation of integral in equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 )",
    "we have used the following expression for modified bessel function ( bateman and erdelyi 1977 )    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the bessel function of zeroth order . by using equation ( 23 )",

    "consequently , the surface energy - loss function in equations ( 16 ) and ( 19 ) reduces to the surface energy - loss function in equations ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) , @xmath86 $ ] , in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "we have evaluated the excitation probabilities in eqs ( 16)-(19 ) with the complex dielectric function for @xmath1 taken from experimental data ( roessler and walker 1967 ) , and for an 80-kev electron beam as in the experiment ( marks 1982 ) .",
    "we first briefly recall the principal results of the investigations carried out by marks ( 1982 ) and cowley ( 1982 ) .",
    "\\(i ) the overall intensity in the eels spectrum ( and therefore also the intensity of a given peak ) decreases when the electron path goes from a lateral surface to the edge of the crystal ( marks 1982 ) ( see also figures 2 - 8 below ) .",
    "\\(ii ) for electron paths along a lateral surface , the intensity of a given peak first slowly increases and then rapidly decreases exponentially as the beam - surface distance goes from inside to outside the wedge ( marks 1982 ) ( see also figure 9 below ) .",
    "\\(iii ) for electron paths both parallel to the lateral surface and along the edge , a surface plasmon at 18 ev was observed , together with a strong enhancement of the low frequencies ( in comparison with the spectrum for electron paths through the bulk , see figure 8 below ) .",
    "the 18-ev peak was attributed by marks ( 1982 ) to a genuine surface resonance , in contrast to cowley s ( 1982 ) interpretation of it as due to transition radiation .",
    "now we are giving the numerical analyzes of the expressions ( 16 ) and ( 19 ) for the excitation probability for @xmath1 .",
    "we have utilized available bulk optical data ( roessler and walker 1967 ) to calculate the differential energy - loss probability .",
    "2 - 6 show the excitation probability for a beam traveling in vacuum parallel to the surface of the sharp - edged wedge at a various wedge interior and beam orientation angles @xmath87 and @xmath88 , at a distance from edge of @xmath89 nm . in figs . 2 - 4 the angle @xmath90 is obtuse",
    ", meanwhile in figure 5 the angle @xmath91 is acute and in this case the dielectric wedge is well - defined . note that as the angle @xmath0 increases ( the angle @xmath90 decreases ) and the wedge becomes well - defined , the maximum intensity of excitation probability shifts from high value of @xmath92 to low plasmon energy region . also the intensity of given peak increases when the electron beam path approaches from the symmetry plane of the wedge to the wedge lateral surface .",
    "figure 6 shows the excitation probability as a function of wedge interior angle @xmath0 for @xmath89 nm and @xmath93 ev .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the cases when beam position angle @xmath88 is changed with increasing of @xmath0 ( the following four values for angle @xmath88 are considered : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively ) .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines correspond to the case when electron beam position angle is fixed with @xmath98and @xmath99 respectively . from this figure",
    "it follows that excitation probability of a given mode in all curves decreases rapidly after the value of @xmath100 rad .    the resonance at @xmath101 ev in figs . 3 - 5 and in solid curve of figure 7",
    "was clearly observed in the experiments ( marks 1982 , cowley 1982 ) , and is not so distinctly apparent in the predictions for the semi - infinite model of the wedge ( garcia - molina _ et al _ 1985 , marks 1982 ) ( see also dotted curve in figure 7 ) .",
    "also this resonance is absent in the case of very large value of the wedge interior angle @xmath90 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "cowley ( 1982 ) attributed this @xmath102-ev mode to transition radiation , but its origin as a genuine surface resonance is clear from the model calculations for the parabolically shaped wedge ( garcia - molina _ et al _ 1985 ) or from the present calculations for sharp - edged wedge .",
    "figure 7 shows the excitation probability for a beam travelling parallel to the edge of the wedge and in front of it , at a distance of @xmath89 nm .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to a well - defined wedge ( @xmath103 or @xmath104 ) , for an angle @xmath105 , and dotted curve is the prediction for a semi - infinite medium .",
    "this latter case , which has been reduced by a factor of 5 , is very similar to the prediction of nearly flat parabolically shaped wedge ( garcia - molina _",
    "et al _ 1985 ) .",
    "for a wedge boundary defined by @xmath103 , figure 8 shows a comparison between the excitation probabilities of the wedge when the electron beam passes in front of the edge ( @xmath105 ) ( dashed curve , which is the same as solid curve in figure 7 ) or along one of its lateral surfaces ( solid line ) . in the first case @xmath89 nm , in the second one @xmath106 nm ( the beam distance to the edge",
    "is taken to be 20 nm and therefore @xmath107 ) .",
    "also shown in figure 8 is the excitation probability ( reduced by a factor of 40 ) for a beam traveling through the bulk of the wedge ( @xmath108 ) , along its symmetry plane ( dotted line ) , and at a distance 20 nm from its edge .",
    "the results in figure 8 may be compared with the experimental findings in figure 2 of marks ( 1982 ) .",
    "the details of the experiment are reproduced by our calculations .",
    "for instance , in the beam - lateral surface interaction spectrum , the intensity of the @xmath109-ev peak is greater than the intensity of the @xmath110-ev peak .",
    "also , the @xmath102-ev peak in this spectrum shifts to @xmath111 ev in the bulk spectrum . the bulk plasmon for @xmath1 is located at @xmath111 ev ( roessler and walker 1967 ) , as seen in figure 8 .",
    "note that for calculation of bulk energy losses we have used the cutoff wave number @xmath52 ( brandt _ et al _ 1974 ) which is much grater than that of used in other works ( @xmath112 nm@xmath113 ) ( illman _ et al _ 1988 , garcia - molina _ et al _ 1985 , marks 1982 ) .",
    "as mentioned in ( ii ) above , marks ( 1982 ) also investigated the excitation probability of the wedge for electron beam positions ranging from @xmath114 nm with respect to the wedge surface , but inside the wedge , up to @xmath114 nm outside the wedge surface .",
    "the beam path in the experiment was far from the edge of the wedge , and the dimensions of the cubic crystal were @xmath115 nm .",
    "we have evaluated the corresponding expressions , ( 16 ) and ( 19 ) , for the wedge interior angle @xmath116 and for beam distances from edge @xmath117 nm .",
    "the results are shown in figure 9 . in agreement with the experimental results ( figure 3 in the work of marks ( 1982 ) ,",
    "see also point ( ii ) above ) , the excitation probability decays exponentially with distance , the slope being larger with increasing the energy value @xmath92 .",
    "the relative intensities of the different curves are also in agreement with the experimental results , the curve for @xmath118 ev crossing the other curves shown in figure 9 . in the experiment",
    "the transition from inside to outside the wedge is broader than figure 9 shows .",
    "one should note , however , that our calculations was done for a point - like charged particle beam , whereas the experimental value of the beam size was rather large , @xmath119 nm .",
    "we recall also that the spectrometer resolution in marks ( 1982 ) experiment is 3 ev .",
    "one of the most easily controlled variables affecting the excitation probability is the incident - beam energy .",
    "it is clearly of practical interest to determine the optimum incident energy which will elicit the greatest response from a given target . to this end",
    "we have determined the energy which would maximize the excitation probability for a given surface mode and a wedge shape . in figure 10",
    "we show the dependence of excitation probability for given surface mode ( @xmath93 ev ) as a function of beam kinetic energy ( @xmath120 kev@xmath121 kev ) for @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) and for various beam positions ( the dotted , dashed , solid and dot - dashed lines correspond to @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively .",
    "the latter two have been divided by factors of 2 and 6 respectively ) .",
    "the beam travels in vacuum at a distance @xmath89 nm from the edge .",
    "it is evident that the excitation probability first , increases rapidly together with the beam energy and after some value ( which grows together with @xmath88 ) slowly decreases .",
    "the plot is given for a 1 - 100 kev energy range and for @xmath128 kev , however , our presumption of a rectilinear trajectory becomes questionable , and we have not shown calculations below the 1-kev level . also for the beam energy range @xmath129 kev the retardation effects become important and a separate investigation is required .",
    "we have investigated here the case of a beam traveling parallel to the edge of a sharp - edged wedge both in vacuum and through the medium .",
    "other configurations , like beam trajectories at constant @xmath9 , trajectories intersecting the tip of the wedge , or reflecting at the lateral surface , may also be of interest in the analysis of the experiments .",
    "note also that the experiment has been performed with a relatively broad probe , @xmath119 nm in diameter , which is comparable to the distance from the beam to the wedge whereas the calculations developed in this paper assume a point - like stem probe .",
    "we have analyzed the electron - wedge interaction in the electrostatic limit .",
    "the electron beam energy ( @xmath130 kev ) is large enough that one may worry about the effect of retardation on the theoretical predictions .",
