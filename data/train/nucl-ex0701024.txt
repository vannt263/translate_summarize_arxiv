    "experimental confirmation of the presence of non - spherical hadron amplitudes ( i.e. d states in quark models or p wave @xmath2-n states ) is fundamental and has been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical interest ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "this effort has focused on the measurement of the electric and coulomb quadrupole amplitudes ( e2 , c2 ) in the predominantly m1 ( magnetic dipole - quark spin flip ) @xmath0 transition .",
    "since the proton has spin 1/2 , no quadrupole moment can be measured .",
    "however , the @xmath1 has spin 3/2 so the @xmath3 reaction can be studied for quadrupole amplitudes in the nucleon and @xmath1 . due to spin and parity conservation in the @xmath4 reaction , only three multipoles can contribute to the transition : the magnetic dipole ( @xmath5 ) , the electric quadrupole ( @xmath6 ) , and the coulomb quadrupole ( @xmath7 ) photon absorption multipoles .",
    "the corresponding resonant pion production multipoles are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "the relative quadrupole to dipole ratios are emr = re(@xmath11 ) and cmr = re(@xmath12 ) . in the quark model ,",
    "the non - spherical amplitudes in the nucleon and @xmath1 are caused by the non - central , tensor interaction between quarks @xcite .",
    "however , the magnitudes of this effect for the predicted e2 and c2 amplitudes@xcite are at least an order of magnitude too small to explain the experimental results and even the dominant m1 matrix element is @xmath13 30% low @xcite .",
    "a likely cause of these dynamical shortcomings is that the quark model does not respect chiral symmetry , whose spontaneous breaking leads to strong emission of virtual pions ( nambu - goldstone bosons)@xcite .",
    "these couple to nucleons as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nucleon spin , and @xmath16 is the pion momentum .",
    "the coupling is strong in the p wave and mixes in non - zero angular momentum components .",
    "however , the multipoles are not observables and must be extracted from the measured cross sections .",
    "the five - fold differential cross section for the @xmath17 reaction is written as five two - fold differential cross sections with an explicit @xmath18 dependence as @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the transverse polarization of the virtual photon , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the virtual photon flux , @xmath18 is the pion center of mass azimuthal angle with respect to the electron scattering plane , @xmath24 is the electron helicity , and @xmath25 is the magnitude of the electron longitudinal polarization .",
    "the virtual photon differential cross sections ( @xmath26 ) are all functions of the center of mass energy @xmath27 , the four momentum transfer squared @xmath28 , and the pion center of mass polar angle @xmath29 ( measured from the momentum transfer direction ) .",
    "they are bilinear combinations of the multipoles @xcite .",
    "the current experiments @xcite do not have sufficient polarization data to perform a model independent multipole analysis and must rely upon models for the non - resonant ( background ) amplitudes .",
    "the standard procedure to extract the multipoles is to use the models to fit the data .",
    "their background terms are unaltered and the three isospin = 3/2 resonance multipoles @xmath30 are fit to the data .",
    "specifically we introduced multiplicative factors , @xmath31 for the @xmath32 multipoles so that the phase , and hence unitarity , is preserved . for the charge channels with a proton target and an outgoing neutral pion ( e.g. @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents any of the three photo - pion multipoles @xmath36 for the final charge state or in the isospin 1/2 and 3/2 states .",
    "three parameter , resonant multipole fits were performed on data taken at @xmath37 @xcite and @xmath38 ( gev / c)@xmath39 @xcite , one @xmath28 value at a time , using four representative calculations : the phenomenological maid 2003 @xcite and said@xcitemodels , and the dynamical models of sato - lee @xcite and dmt @xcite .",
    "the fits are presented in terms of @xmath8 , emr = e2/m1 = re(@xmath40 , and cmr = c2/m1 = re(@xmath41 .",
    "at least one multipole is expressed in absolute terms rather than as a ratio because some models can give accurate predictions for ratios but not for absolute sizes .",
    "figure [ fig : before_after_fit ] shows our new , low @xmath28 data along with several model predictions before and after the three resonant parameter fitting .",
    "the convergence is rather significant .",
    "only the data points in the top three plots were included in the fits and yet the parallel cross section as a function of the center of mass energy @xmath27 converged nicely . note that since the sato - lee model does not include higher resonances , it was not expected to fit the data well at higher @xmath27 explaining the deviation observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : before_after_fit ] .",
    "also , as expected , the @xmath42 curves did not converge since this time reversal odd observable @xcite is primarily sensitive to background amplitudes and the fit is only for resonant amplitudes .",
    "the bottom half of figure [ fig : before_after_fit ] shows the `` spherical '' calculated curves when the resonant quadrupole amplitudes ( @xmath9 in @xmath43 and @xmath10 in @xmath44 , see appendix for multipole expansions of the observables ) are set equal to zero .",
    "the difference between the spherical and full curves shows the sensitivity of these cross sections to the quadrupole amplitudes and demonstrates the basis of the measurement of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 multipoles .",
    "the small spread in the spherical curves indicates their sensitivity to the model dependence of the background amplitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : emr_cmr ] shows the values for the emr and cmr for the four models before and after fitting .",
    "it is seen that there is a very strong convergence of these values after fitting .",
    "we have quoted the average value of these parameters as the measured value and are using the rms deviation to estimate the model - to - model error@xcite since these four models are sufficiently different to have a reasonable estimate of the present state of model dependence of the multipoles . at the present time",
    "the model - to - model and experimental errors are approximately equal .    [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while looking to improve the fits , an exhausive search was performed of all combinations of the three resonant parameters and any combination of the 13 remaining parameters .",
    "no significant improvement was found for either @xmath37 or @xmath47 ( gev / c)@xmath39 .",
    "it is time , then , to look beyond fitting the multipoles .",
    "it is possible to modify internal model parameters ( form factors , coupling constants ) which affect many multipoles simultaneously but in different ways .",
    "this may allow the models to fit the data better .",
    "however , this fitting most likely needs to be performed by the model authors .",
    "the understanding of the @xmath1 will also be improved with experiments that are closer to complete . with target and",
    "recoil polarization , more observables are accessable and these have different combinations of multipoles .",
    "these new combinations will further constrain the models allowing better fits and smaller uncertainties in the backgrounds . until new data are available , though , fitting the data and improving the models remain the best options .",
    "experimental results using the @xmath48 reaction have advanced the understanding of the shape of the proton and the @xmath1",
    ". however , the analysis process begins with extracting multipoles ( which are not observables ) from cross sections ( which are ) . without complete experiments including target and",
    "recoil polarization , the extraction must rely upon models for the background amplitudes . performing standard three resonant parameter fits",
    "has allowed a good deal of progress to be made . near resonance , fits using various models converge at @xmath37 and 0.126 ( gev / c)@xmath39 despite the differences in the model backgrounds .",
    "however , what has not been fully understood is the effect these differing backgrounds can have on the resonant parameters .    to answer that question ,",
    "we have added thirteen more background amplitudes to our three parameter fits and systematically examined the effect of each one on all three resonant multipoles .",
    "those additional background amplitudes are the four remaining s and p wave amplitudes , three isospin 1/2 amplitudes and six amplitudes we have constructed , the @xmath49s .",
    "the large effect of some of the @xmath49 terms shows how small multipoles which may have been ignored separately , can combine to have a sizable effect on the resonant amplitudes .    as part of the systematic examination of the additional background amplitudes",
    ", correlations were found between them and the resonant amplitudes which led to larger errors and/or shifts in the values of the extracted resonant multipoles .",
    "we also found that while some amplitudes exhibit a large sensitivity in @xmath50 , no universal criteria could be found which would predict a sensitivity in the resonant amplitudes .",
    "some background amplitudes which were sensitive did not affect the fits while others which were not sensitive did .",
    "however , varying the background amplitudes which were highly correlated with the resonant multipoles did affect the extracted resonant multipoles .",
    "previous works have shown that the experimental and model - to - model errors are similar in size @xcite .",
    "what this exercise has shown is that the intrinsic model error is also similar in size to the model - to - model error .",
    "the current data really are challenging the existing models .",
    "so , without improvement in the models or more complete experiments , this is as far as the current data can take us .    in general",
    ", the models agree with the data in a qualitative way but a good quantitative decription will require further refinement of those models .",
    "it is possible that some of the models may be made to fit the data much better with adjustment of the proper parameters .",
    "adjusting a form factor or coupling constant within the model will change many multipoles in ways that are different from how they were varied in this study .",
    "once the models are improved , they can be further tested with experiments that utilize target and recoil polarization .",
    "these introduce new combinations of multipoles which will further constrain the models .",
    "however , until new data are available , improvement of the models is the only option which will allow a better understanding of the @xmath1 .",
    "finally we return to the question that has primarily motivated this field : do we have definitive evidence that the nucleon and @xmath1 have non - spherical components and if so how large ? based on this study we follow reference @xcite and present figure [ fig : m2003_bands ] which indicates the final sensitivity to the quadrupole amplitudes . on the right",
    "is @xmath51 which is sensitive to the @xmath46 quadrupole term . on",
    "the left is a special construction , @xmath52@xcite which cancels out the dominant @xmath53 multipole contribution and shows the effect of the smaller @xmath45 quadrupole contribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2003_bands ] , the range of predictions using all the four parameter fits was found by cycling through all the fits and storing the maximum and minimum . in this way",
    ", a high probability region was identified where the physical multipole would be expected to be . for comparison ,",
    "the same procedure was repeated but with the quadrupole amplitudes set to zero .",
    "on the basis of this study of the uncertainties in the resonance and background amplitudes we agree with the previous conclusion@xcite that a significant contribution of quadrupole amplitudes has been observed .",

    "these plots represent fits using the maid 2003 model .",
