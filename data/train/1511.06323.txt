    "ebola virus is a severe infection affecting currently several african countries , mainly guinea , sierra leone , and liberia . it was first discovered in 1976 in the democratic republic of congo , near the ebola river , where the virus takes its name , but recently was also identified in west africa @xcite .",
    "the latest outbreak of the virus was not only the largest , it is also the deadliest infectious disease outbreak ever known . according to the world health organisation ( who ) , `` it is thought that fruit bats of the pteropodidae family are natural ebola virus hosts '' .",
    "it then spreads through human - to - human transmission , becoming the deadliest pathogen .",
    "the early signs and symptoms of the virus include a sudden onset of fever , intense weakness and headache . over time",
    ", symptoms become increasingly severe and include diarrhea , raised rash , internal and external bleeding , from nose , mouth , eyes and anus . as the virus spreads through the body , it damages the immune system and organs @xcite .",
    "ebola virus is transmitted to an initial human by contact with an infected animal s body fluid . on the other hand",
    ", human - to - human transmission can take place with direct contact ( through broken skin or mucous membranes in , for example , the eyes , nose , or mouth ) with blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from ebola .",
    "it is also transmitted indirectly via exposure to objects or environment contaminated with infected secretions @xcite .",
    "there is yet no licensed treatment proven to neutralise the virus , but a range of blood , immunological and drug therapies are under development .",
    "mathematical models are a powerful tool for investigating human infectious diseases , such as ebola virus , contributing to the understanding of the dynamics of disease and providing useful predictions about the potential transmission of a disease and the effectiveness of possible control measures , which can provide valuable information for public health policy makers @xcite .",
    "cases of success include influenza and small pox , for which epidemic models have provided the foundation for the best vaccination practices @xcite .",
    "epidemic models date back to the early twentieth century , to a set of three articles from 1927 , 1932 , and 1933 by kermack and mckendrick , whose models were used for modelling the plague and cholera epidemics @xcite .",
    "the most commonly implemented models in epidemiology are the sir and seir models .",
    "the sir model consists of three compartments : susceptible individuals @xmath0 , infectious individuals @xmath1 , and recovered individuals @xmath2 . in many infectious diseases",
    "there is an exposed period after the transmission of the infection from susceptible to potentially infective members but before these potential infective can transmit infection .",
    "then an extra compartment is introduced , the so called exposed class @xmath3 , and we use compartments @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 to give a generalization of the basic sir model @xcite .",
    "when analyzing a new outbreak , the researchers usually start with the sir and seir models to fit the available outbreak data , obtaining estimates for the parameters of the model @xcite . in the modelling of the spreading mechanism of the ebola virus currently affecting several african countries , rachah and torres used the sir @xcite and the seir @xcite basic models . in their work , they used parameters identified from recent data of the who to describe the behavior of the virus .",
    "after modelling and simulation steps , they applied optimal control techniques in order to understand how the spread of the virus may be controlled , e.g. , through education campaigns , immunization or isolation @xcite .    here",
    "we discuss the differences between the sir and seir models , previously presented by rachah and torres in their study of the description of the behavior of the ebola virus @xcite . for a non - integer order ( fractional ) seir model see @xcite .",
    "our comparison is based on the numerical resolution of the models . in order to study which model",
    "can better control the propagation of the virus into population , we discuss the comparison between the sir and seir models by studying the optimal control of the ebola virus .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we briefly recall the sir and seir models for ebola infection .",
    "their numerical simulation is carried out in section  [ sec:3 ] , where we emphasise the differences between them .",
    "the best strategies for the control of the propagation of ebola into the populations , accordingly to both models , are investigated in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "we end with section  [ sec : conc ] of conclusion .",
    "sir and seir models provide the foundations of mathematical modelling in epidemiology , being widely used in practice , to describe real world problems in epidemiology . in this section ,",
    "we briefly describe the two mathematical models .    in the modelling of ebola virus , rachah and",
    "torres @xcite used the basic sir ( susceptible  infectious  recovery ) model . in the description of the transmission of ebola virus by the sir model ,",
    "the population is divided into three groups :    * the susceptible compartment @xmath4 denotes individuals who are susceptible to catch the virus , and so might become infectious if exposed ; * the infectious compartment @xmath5 denotes infectious individuals who are suffering the symptoms of ebola and are able to spread the virus through contact with the susceptible class of individuals ; * the `` recovered '' compartment @xmath6 denotes individuals that do not affect the transmission dynamics in any way .",
    "the model is described by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) : @xmath7 \\dfrac{di(t)}{dt } =   \\beta s(t)i(t ) - \\mu i(t),\\\\[0.3 cm ] \\dfrac{dr(t)}{dt } =   \\mu i(t ) , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the infection rate and @xmath9 is the recovered rate .",

    "the exposed compartment @xmath11 denotes the individuals who are infected but the symptoms of the virus are not yet visible .",
    "the transmission of the virus is then described by the following set of nonlinear odes : @xmath12 \\dfrac{d\\hat{e}(t)}{dt } = \\hat{\\beta } \\hat{s}(t)\\hat{i}(t ) - \\hat{\\gamma } \\hat{e}(t),\\\\[0.3 cm ] \\dfrac{d\\hat{i}(t)}{dt } = \\hat{\\gamma } \\hat{e}(t ) - \\hat{\\mu } \\hat{i}(t),\\\\[0.3 cm ] \\dfrac{d\\hat{r}(t)}{dt } = \\hat{\\mu } \\hat{i}(t ) , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the contact rate ( transmission rate ) , @xmath14 is the infection rate , and @xmath15 is the recovered rate .",
    "the initial conditions are given by @xmath16 the particularity of the seir model is in the exposed compartment , which is characterized by infected individuals that can not communicate the virus .",
    "these individuals are in the so called latent period @xcite . for ebola virus",
    ", such stage makes all sense since it takes a certain time for an infected individual to become infectious . during this period of time",
    "such individuals are in the exposed compartment @xmath11 , before they become infectious .",
    "the infectious compartment at time @xmath17 , denoted by @xmath18 , represents the individuals that are infected by the virus and are able to spread it through contact with the susceptible class of individuals .",
    "finally , we have the `` recovered '' compartment @xmath19 , which denotes the individuals that do not affect the transmission dynamics in any way .",

    "the difference in the number of infectious between the two models is explained by the fact that the exposed individuals certainly moved to the infectious class since the ebola virus is characterized by a short latent period , then it spreads very quickly .",

    "one can see that the control is more important in the seir model than in the sir case .",
    "more precisely , figure  [ cntrl_seir_seir ] shows that the optimal control function of the seir model starts at the upper bound 0.9 , while the optimal control of the sir model starts at 0.2 .",
    "this fact is explained by the severity of the spread of the virus , which requires an immediate implementation against the virus , and the superiority of the seir system in modelling ebola : the exposed compartment of the seir model shows the severity of the virus , where individuals can be infected in the beginning , without symptoms , and then transmission blows up during the latent period .",
