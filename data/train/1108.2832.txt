    "spiral ( or helical ) order is a very important phenomenon in condensed matter physics , especially in soft matters .",
    "a typical case is the well - known deoxyribonucleic acid dna . in solid state",
    ", the spiral order can also be found in spin systems with competing exchange interactions .",
    "studies on the spiral order in these systems could be traced back to the later of 1950s@xcite . up to now , many works on the spiral order have been published@xcite . among these studies ,",
    "an interesting example is the one - dimensional xxz spin chain with unparallel boundary fields @xcite .",
    "the model s ground state shows a spiral order .",
    "moreover , it has been solved exactly using the bethe - ansatz method @xcite , hence many physical properties can be well studied without any approximation .",
    "however , as far as we know , no one addressed the critical phenomena occurring in spin systems with spiral order in perspective of quantum information science @xcite .",
    "so the main motivation of the present paper is to study the spiral order transition in terms of the concept of fidelity from the quantum information science . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider a quantum spin chain whose ground state consists of a spiral order phase and a paramagnetic phase . the quantum phase transition occurring between the two phases",
    "is studied in perspectives of quantum information science and spin torsion modulus .",
    "we show that the modes of the ground - state fidelity and its susceptibility can tell the change of the period of the spiral order around the critical point .",
    "we study also the spin torsion modulus , which defines the coefficient of the potential energy stored under a small rotation , around the critical point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce the model and solve it exactly in a standard procedure . the quantum phase transitions from a spiral order phase to a paramagnetic phase is also discussed . in section [ sec : fs ] , we study the quantum phase transition in term of mode fidelity and its susceptibility . we show that the mode fidelity and its susceptibility can not only detect the critical point , but also indicate which mode undergoes a significant change at the critical point . in section [ sec : spinmodulus ] , we study the spin torsion modulus of the model at the zero temperature .",
    "we find away from the critical point , the normalized spin torsion modulus tends to zero as the system size increases ; while at the critical point , it is a constant . finally , a summary is given in section [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we consider a spin chain described by the hamiltonian @xmath0where @xmath1 is the twisted 1/2 spin operators .",
    "they are defined as @xmath2 \\sigma _ { j}^{x}\\exp \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2}j\\phi \\sigma _ { j}^{z}\\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ s_{j}^{y } & \\equiv & \\exp \\left [ \\frac{i}{2}j\\phi \\sigma _ { j}^{z}\\right ] \\sigma _ { j}^{y}\\exp \\left [ -\\frac{i}{2}j\\phi \\sigma _ { j}^{z}\\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\ s_{j}^{z } & \\equiv & \\sigma _ { j}^{z},\\end{aligned}\\]]where",
    "@xmath3 is an angle and @xmath4 are the pauli matrices .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath5 satisfies the su(2 ) lie algebra , i.e. @xmath6 & = & 2is_{j}^{z } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ s_{j}^{y},s_{j}^{z}\\right ] & = & 2is_{j}^{x } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\left [ s_{j}^{z},s_{j}^{x}\\right ] & = & 2is_{j}^{y}.\\end{aligned}\\]]if we introduce @xmath7then the hamiltonian becomes@xmath8 -h\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sigma _ { j}^{z}.\\end{aligned}\\]]the hamiltonian either exchanges the state of a pair of anti - parallel spins , or flip two upward spins to downward or vice versa .",
    ", so if we define a parity operator@xmath9and the hamiltonian can not change the parity of the state , that is .",
    "@xmath10=0.\\]]therefore , we have two subspaces corresponding to parity @xmath11 respectively .    if @xmath12 , the hamiltonian describes the one - dimensional transverse field ising model @xcite with ferromagnetic order@xmath13while if @xmath14 , it describes the same model but with antiferromagnetic order .",
    "mathematically , if we introduce a unitary transformation@xmath15 , \\]]the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian1 ] ) can be transformed to the one - dimensional transverse field ising model , i.e. @xmath16therefore , the energy spectra of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian1 ] ) is the same as the quantum ising model if the corresponding boundary conditions are satisfied .",
    "nevertheless , what we are interested in this paper is the change in the structure of the ground - state wavefunction around the quantum critical point . for this purpose",
    ", we still want to take the standard procedure to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian1 ] ) and get the ground - state wavefunction explicitly .",
    "the procedure consists of three transformations , as shown below .     and period @xmath17 .",
    "right : a spiral order with @xmath18 and period @xmath19 , which actually corresponds to an antiferromagnetic order.,width=302 ]    _ the jordan - wigner transformation : _ the jordan - wigner transformation maps 1/2 spins to spinless fermions , that is@xmath20 c_{n}=\\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}\\sigma _ { j}^{z}c_{n } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma _ { n}^{- } & = & \\exp \\left [ -i\\pi \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}c_{j}^{\\dagger } c_{j}% \\right ] c_{n}^{\\dagger } = \\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}\\sigma _ { j}^{z}c_{n}^{\\dagger } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma _ { n}^{z } & = & 1 - 2c_{n}^{\\dagger } c_{n}.\\end{aligned}\\]]then the hamiltonian becomes@xmath21 -\\sum_{j=1}^{n}h\\left ( 1 - 2c_{j}^{\\dagger } c_{j}\\right ) .",

    "so the ground state locates in the subspace of @xmath23 . under this condition",

    "because of this , one can find the coefficients in the transformation ( eq : bogtran ) should satisfy the following condition    @xmath36    so we can introduce trigonal relation @xmath37inserting the bogoliubov transformation into eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian_isingk ] ) , the hamiltonian can be diagonalized under the conditions@xmath38then the hamiltonian becomes    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the dispersion relation @xmath41from eq .",
    "( [ eq : diagonalizedh ] ) , we can judge that the ground state is a vacuum state of @xmath32 .",
    "then the ground - state energy can be calculated as@xmath42    from the dispersion of quasi particles [ eq . ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) ] , we can see that the system is gapless only at @xmath43 at which a quantum phase transition is expected to occur . if @xmath44 , the system is gapped .",
    "the two phases can be understood from the corresponding limiting cases . if @xmath45 , all spin are oriented along the @xmath26-direction .",
    "it is a paramagnetic phase . if @xmath46 , the spin chain shows a spiral order .",
    "the period of the spiral order is determined by @xmath3 . in fig . 1",
    ", we show a sketch of spiral orders with @xmath47 and @xmath48respectively .",
    "the @xmath14 mode actually corresponds to the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the competition between spiral orders and paramagnetic state leads to the quantum phase transitions at @xmath43 .",
    "since the ground state @xmath49 must satisfy @xmath50 , to obtain the ground state , we need to express the operator @xmath51 in terms of @xmath52 , @xmath53the condition @xmath54 gives @xmath55the ground state takes the form@xmath56    since the parity here is even , the excited states can be obtained by applying @xmath57 @xmath33s with different @xmath28s to the ground state . the number of states which belong to this subspace is not @xmath58 , but @xmath59 . with a similar procedure , we can obtained another @xmath60 in the subspace of @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath62.,width=377 ]    in this section , we are going to study the quantum phase transition occurring at the critical point @xmath43 in terms of a concept called fidelity emerging from quantum information science .",
    "the fidelity measures the similarity between two states .",
    "it has been used to study quantum phase transitions in recent years because it can describe the structure change of the ground - state wavefunction as the system varies across a quantum critical point pzanardi2006,hqzhou0701,wlyou07,schen07,venuti07,sjgu08,hqzhou2008,sjgureview . according to previous publication record",
    ", it is commonly believed that the fidelity can not only detect conventional phase transitions described by landau s symmetry - breaking theorem , but also some unconventional phase transitions , such as topological quantum phase transitions and kosterlitz - thouless phase transitions .    for the present model",
    ", the fidelity between @xmath25 and @xmath63 can be calculated as @xmath64 , which corresponds to the one - dimensional transverse field ising model with ferromagnetic order . around the critical point , @xmath43 , a quantum phase transition from a ferromagnetic phase to a paramagnetic phase occurs .",
    "since the ferromagnetic order refers to @xmath65 mode , we expect the @xmath66 mode in the ground - state wavefunction undergoes a significant change around the critical point , while other irrelevant modes do not show significant changes .",
    "we take a sample of @xmath67 sites as an example , and show the above interpretation in fig .",

    "if @xmath72 , we can obtain @xmath73actually , iff @xmath74 , @xmath75 diverges in order of @xmath76 at the critical point . on the other hand , if we let @xmath77 directly , we find@xmath78around the critical point . therefore , for the mode fidelity susceptibility , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the scaling relation @xmath83 is satisfied .",
    "clearly @xmath75 diverges more quickly than the normalized fidelity susceptibility @xmath84 whose critical exponent is 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath85 is not proportional to@xmath86 , @xmath75 is intensive and independent of the system size @xmath87 .",
    "so @xmath75 shows no singular behavior around the critical point .    as a numerical demonstration",

    ", we can see that the mode fidelity susceptibility shows singular behavior at the mode @xmath47 , and no singular behavior elsewhere . from this point of view , the mode fidelity susceptibility might be more efficient to describe the quantum phase transition occurring in the present model .",
    "now we compare the mode fidelity with another related and well studied concept , i.e. , the fidelity per site @xcite . for the present model , the fidelity per site",
