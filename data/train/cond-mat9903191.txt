    "the approach to equilibrium in isotropic systems which are quenched from a high - temperature homogeneous phase to a low - temperature two - phase region is now relatively well understood@xcite .",
    "the basic feature of such systems is that they typically organize into a coarsening mosaic of single - phase regions , with a characteristic length scale that grows as a power law in time . for driven systems , on the other hand ,",
    "considerably less progress has been made in understanding the coarsening dynamics , although the stationary properties have been thoroughly investigated @xcite . in the presence of driving ,",
    "the physically relevant coarsening mechanisms are those with conserved order - parameter dynamics .",
    "this would be appropriate , for example , for treating the phase separation of binary liquids or binary alloys under the influence of gravity @xcite .    in this spirit , cornell and bray @xcite recently studied the coarsening dynamics of an ising chain which is endowed with conserved spin - exchange kawasaki dynamics and which is also subject to a driving field which favors transport of up spins to the right and down spins to the left .",
    "they argue that in the limit of low temperature and weak field , the spin dynamics is equivalent to domain diffusion ( dd ) @xcite . in this dd process ,",
    "up domains hop rigidly by one lattice spacing to the right , and down domains hop by one lattice spacing to the left . due to this nearest - neighbor hopping ,",
    "small domains are progressively `` squeezed out '' and the adjacent neighboring domains coalesce .",
    "this random walk mechanism leads both to a reduction in the number of domains and an increase in their average length , @xmath0 .",
    "numerical evidence was also presented that the density of domains of length @xmath3 obeys the scaling form @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this further implies a @xmath5 asymptotic decay for the density of domains of fixed length .",
    "the goal of this paper is to show that there is a subtle but crucial difference between the dynamics of individual spins in the driven ising chain with spin conserving dynamics and the dd process .",
    "the fundamental point is that for the shortest domains  dimers  the spin - level dynamics results in _ long - range _ dimer hopping , with the average jump length growing as @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , for the dd process , dimers necessarily jump to the next domain boundary , that is , they jump a distance of order @xmath8 . therefore dimers disappear more slowly than in the dd process , and the overall coarsening rate is dimer controlled ( dc ) .",
    "this dc system is characterized by two independent length scales : ( a ) the average domain length @xmath9 , which is still proportional to @xmath10 , as in the dd process , and ( b ) the average dimer hopping distance , which is proportional to @xmath11 . as a result of the two length scales , the density of domains of fixed length asymptotically decays as @xmath4 , instead of the @xmath5 decay of the dd process .",
    "correspondingly , the domain length distribution in the dc process does not obey conventional scaling in the small - length limit , although the domain length distributions for both the dd and dc processes are visually similar .    in sec .",
    "ii , we define the spin dynamics precisely and describe the correspondences to the dd and dc processes .",
    "we also discuss their essential differences and show how the latter process provides a faithful description of the microscopic spin dynamics .",
    "we then present heuristic arguments which suggest new kinetic behavior for the dc process .",
    "simulation results which support our basic arguments are presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we outline a perturbative approach , based on a matched asymptotic expansion , which accounts for the observed breakdown of scaling in the domain length distribution for vanishingly small minority fraction .",
    "v contains both a summary and a brief discussion of open issues .",
    "the microscopic system is a chain of ising spins with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction @xmath12 .",
    "the chain is subject to spin - exchange dynamics , where the only possible re - arrangement process is the exchange of two anti - parallel nearest - neighbor spins .",
    "thus the magnetization is manifestly conserved ( we use a magnetic terminology , although a system with conserved dynamics naturally applies to an alloy ) .",
    "the exchange occurs at a rate proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the energy difference between the initial and final states , and @xmath15 is the temperature ( with boltzmann constant set to unity ) .",
    "there is also a driving field @xmath16 which favors motion of up spins to the right and down spins to the left .",
    "the spin - flip events are : @xmath17 the first two processes occur on domain boundaries , while the last two account for the motion of a single spin which is inside a domain of the opposite sign .",
    "the `` forward '' processes involve the energy change @xmath14 , while the `` backward '' processes have energy change @xmath18 .",
    "interesting dynamics arises in the limit of low ( but non - zero ) temperature and weak driving field , that is , @xmath19 . to appreciate the nature of the dynamics for this parameter range , notice that in one dimension ( 1d ) the order - disorder transition occurs at @xmath20 . at @xmath21 ,",
    "the spin - exchange dynamics traps the system in a metastable state which consists of domains of lengths @xmath22 @xcite . to avoid this `` freezing '' , the temperature must be non - zero . at low but non - zero temperature , the system will coarsen as long as the mean domain length is smaller than the correlation length @xmath23 .    the limit where the driving field satisfies @xmath24 leads to an _ approximate _ equivalence with the dd process @xcite . to understand this correspondence ,",
    "consider the situation after domains have coarsened to relatively large length . by process @xmath25 ,",
    "an up spin may detach from the right edge of an up domain with rate @xmath26 , or equivalently , a down spin may detach from the left edge of a down domain . similarly , an up spin may also detach from the left edge of an up domain ( or a down spin may detach from the right edge of down domain ) by step @xmath27 . however , this process occurs at a rate which is a factor @xmath28 smaller than @xmath25 . moreover , even if step @xmath29 occurs , the detached spin quickly recombines with the same domain by the reverse process @xmath30 , since the motion of the detached spin away from the domain is energetically unfavorable .",
    "once @xmath31 occurs , the system evolves further either by @xmath32 , which corresponds to the up spin moving to the right and eventually joining the next up domain , or by @xmath33 , where a down spin moves to the left and joins the next down domain .",
    "the former process is illustrated in fig .  1 . as a result of these processes ,",
    "an up domain hops rigidly by one lattice spacing to the right or a down domain hops one spacing to the left .",
    "if we measure the time in units of @xmath34 , then both these hopping steps occur at unit rate , _ independent _ of the domain length .",
    "= 5.6cm=4.0 cm 0.5 in 0.15 in    an essential feature of the low - temperature weak - field limit @xmath24 is that all other processes are asymptotically negligible in the intermediate - time range where coarsening is occurring .",
    "thus in this time range the system consists of the contiguous array of alternating up and down domains , and the dynamics proceeds by taking an up ( down ) domain and moving it one lattice site to the right ( left ) .",
    "whenever a domain shrinks to zero size , its two adjacent neighbors coalesce .",
    "this description is the basis of the correspondence to the dd model .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the absence of a driving field , the dynamics again reduces to a dd process , but with a length - dependent hopping rate that is proportional to the inverse domain length @xcite .",
    "= 3.75cm1.5 cm 0.15 in    a crucial feature of the mapping between the spin and the domain dynamics which is not apparent from the above description is the evolution of dimers ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "consider an up dimer .",
    "if the rightmost spin of the dimer detaches , the dimer is converted into two isolated up spins in a sea of down spins .",
    "according to the spin dynamics , each isolated spin independently and freely hops to the right .",
    "consequently their separation undergoes a simple random walk .",
    "the motion of spins anti - parallel to the field can be neglected , since this motion is inhibited by a factor @xmath28 .",
    "the hopping of this pair of separated spins terminates in one of two ways : ( i ) the rightmost up spin reaches the next domain boundary and subsequently the other up spin hits this same boundary .",
    "this corresponds to the coalescence of the two adjacent down domains and is part of the dd picture .",
    "( ii ) the dimer recombines _ before _ the next domain boundary is reached ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "dimer recombination is the crucial new feature which was not included in the dd process .",
    "this recombination plays an essential asymptotic role because the average dimer jump distance @xmath35 is much smaller than the average domain length @xmath8 in the long - time limit .",
    "consequently , recombination of a dimer is much more probable than domain coalescence . to verify this assertion",
    "let us estimate @xmath35 .",
    "the dimer recombines if the separation between the two spins shrinks to zero before the rightmost spin reaches the next domain boundary .",
    "this is a classic first - passage process , and the probability that this separation first equals zero at @xmath36 steps is given by @xcite @xmath37 for large @xmath38 , this expression simplifies to @xmath39 .",
    "the average dimer jump distance @xmath35 may now be estimated as @xmath40 .",
    "thus asymptotically @xmath41 .",
    "we now use this picture to estimate the overall time dependence of small - length domains .",
    "the crucial feature is that a domain can disappear only if a dimer first dissociates and then does not recombine before its constituent spins reach the next domain boundary . from the analogy with the first - passage process",
    ", the probability @xmath42 that the dissociated dimer does not recombine before the next domain boundary is given by @xmath43 since the disappearance of a dimer leads to domain coalescence , the total number of domains @xmath44 obeys the rate equation @xmath45    on the other hand , the dynamics of large domains should still be governed by the gain and loss of single spins at the boundary , as outlined in fig .",
    "since these gain and loss processes occur at the same rate , the domain length undergoes an isotropic random walk , so that @xmath9 should grow as @xmath10 .",
    "correspondingly , the number of domains @xmath44 decays as @xmath46 , the inverse of the average domain length . substituting these two expectations into eq .",
    "( [ ndot ] ) , we immediately obtain @xmath47 this slower decay of dimers is one of the primary features of the dc process .",
    "it should be compared with the prediction @xmath48 which arises from the dd process .",
    "this latter time dependence would be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ ndot ] ) if the rate of dimer disappearance were unity , rather than proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "this @xmath50 exponent value has fundamental implications for the density of domains of length @xmath3 , @xmath2 .",
    "let us suppose that this density obeys the conventional scaling hypothesis @xmath51 where the prefactor @xmath52 follows from the length normalization condition @xmath53 . if @xmath54 , then either @xmath55 as @xmath56 , or @xmath2 does not obey scaling for small @xmath3 .",
    "we shall present evidence from both simulations and an analytical approach that strongly favors the latter alternative .",
    "in our simulations , we first initialize an array of alternating up and down domains of random lengths . for minority phase density @xmath57 , we choose the average length of minority domains to be @xmath58 , and @xmath59 for the majority phase .",
    "the time evolution involves the following steps : ( i ) pick a domain at random .",
    "( ii ) move an up ( down ) domain of length @xmath60 to the right ( left ) .",
    "( iii ) if the domain is a dimer , choose its jump distance @xmath38 from the probability distribution @xmath61 given by eq .",
    "( [ pl ] ) .",
    "if @xmath38 exceeds the length of the neighboring domain , remove the dimer and merge the surrounding domains .",
    "( iv ) update the time by @xmath62 .",
    "simulations were performed on a chain of @xmath63 domains for times up to @xmath64 , and averaged over @xmath65 samples .",
    "this is of the same order of data as the simulations of cornell and bray@xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ nvst ] , we plot @xmath44 for various minority fractions @xmath57 . also shown",
    "are the corresponding results for the dd process .",
    "the linearity of the data suggests power - law behavior , and visually the asymptotic slopes are very close to the expected value of @xmath66 . the essential difference between dc and dd models",
    "is manifested by the behavior of the dimer density .",
    "[ ctwovst ] shows that the dimer density indeed decays more slowly than in the dd model .",
    "= 7.5cm=7.5 cm 0.0 in 0.15 in    = 7.5cm=7.5 cm 0.0 in 0.15 in    to highlight this difference , we plot the corresponding local exponents in fig .",
    "[ locexp1 ] .",
    "we define the local exponent at time @xmath67 as the best - fit straight line to 10 successive data points ( equally spaced on a logarithmic scale ) up to time @xmath67 in the double logarithmic plot of @xmath68 versus @xmath67 .",
    "this definition significantly smooths statistical fluctuations while still revealing systematic trends in the data . as shown in fig .",
    "[ locexp1 ] , the local exponents of the dd and dc models are clearly different . for the dd model ,",
    "these exponents are close to the expected value @xmath69 and also exhibit weak systematic time dependence .",
    "thus , the natural conclusion is that the dimer density ( as well as the density of domains of any fixed length ) asymptotically decays as @xmath5 .    for the dc model ,",
    "the situation is more subtle .",
    "the local exponents initially are increasing with time , but this time dependence slows when the effective exponent value is close to the anticipated value @xmath50 .",
    "however , the systematic ambiguities in the data make an extrapolation for the asymptotic value of the exponent uncertain . this uncertainty and",
    "the relatively small difference in the dimer exponent for the two models led us to consider @xmath70 rather than @xmath68 . indeed , since both @xmath44 and @xmath68 should be influenced by the same pre - asymptotic corrections , such corrections might cancel when @xmath71 is expressed as a function of @xmath72 . from a scaling perspective ,",
    "it is also natural to express dependences in terms of intrinsic variables , rather than in terms of the extrinsic time variable .",
    "thus in fig .",
    "[ cvsn ] , we plot the local exponents of @xmath70 versus @xmath72 and the results are now relatively straightforward to interpret .",
    "since the variation in the local exponent for the dc model is small over the entire range of @xmath72 , the result @xmath73 is strongly suggested .",
    "similarly , the dd data suggests that @xmath74 , as is anticipated from @xmath75 and @xmath48 . coupled with the basic result @xmath75 which holds for both models , we conclude , now with considerable confidence , that @xmath54 for the dc model .",

    "this ultimately arises from the multi - step dissociation and recombination processes that govern the disappearance of dimers .",
    "we first test the conventional scaling hypothesis for the domain length distribution , namely , @xmath76 , by plotting @xmath77 versus @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ summ2 ] .",
    "= 7.5cm=7.5 cm 0.0 in 0.15 in    at the scale shown , this distribution appears to exhibit data collapse .",
    "in fact , at the resolution of this figure , the domain length distributions for the dd and dc processes are virtually indistinguishable . however , for the scaling form to be compatible with @xmath54 , the scaling function must vary as @xmath79 as @xmath56 , while the length distribution appears to be linear in @xmath3 in the small - length limit .",
    "this linearity implies that the distribution can not obey single - parameter scaling for all lengths .",
    "in fact , a closer examination of the small-@xmath3 tail ( fig .  [ summ3 ] ) reveals that there is that there is a small but systematic deviation from data collapse .",
    "the breakdown of scaling is manifested by the length distribution having a non - zero intercept with the @xmath80 axis , whose value is systematically decreasing with time .",
    "= 7.5cm=7.5 cm 0.0 in 0.15 in",
    "to better understand the nature of the domain length distribution , we focus on the limit where the fraction of minority spins @xmath57 is vanishingly small .",
    "this leads to considerable simplification in the domain dynamics .",
    "generally , the length of a domain can change by @xmath82 due to diffusion of neighboring domains , or the length can change arbitrarily by domain coalescence . in the limit @xmath83 ,",
    "the diffusive `` shrinkage '' governs the disappearance of minority domains , while coalescence governs the disappearance majority domains . to verify this ,",
    "let us estimate the characteristic times for the disappearance of the majority and minority domains by shrinkage .",
    "let @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) denote the average length of minority ( majority ) domains .",
    "a majority domain can shrink to zero in a time @xmath86 of order @xmath87 , while the shrinking and disappearance of a minority domain requires a time @xmath88 .",
    "thus @xmath89 therefore in the minority limit , shrinkage of majority domains , or equivalently , coalescence of minority domains is negligible . consequently the minority domains are effectively non - interacting and they evolve only by the addition or loss of single spins as a result of the hopping of majority domains .",
    "therefore the density of minority domains @xmath2 obeys the discrete diffusion equation @xmath90    the density of dimers @xmath91 obeys a separate , but similar equation . for dimers",

    "( [ bound ] ) suggests the existence of an additional length scale @xmath99 .",
    "the competition between these two scales determines the asymptotic behavior .",
    "we therefore separately consider the `` inner '' region of small domains @xmath100 and the `` outer '' region of large domains @xmath101 , and then match these limiting solutions in the overlap region @xmath102 @xcite .    in the inner region @xmath100",
