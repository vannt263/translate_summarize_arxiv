    "the globular clusters of the milky way consist of two distinctly separated groups , each with approximately gaussian metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) distributions .",
    "this bimodality was first quantified by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] values for the two groups are approximately @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "as detailed by these authors and many others since then , the bimodality is not confined just to the distribution over [ fe / h ] .",
    "the two groups have quite distinct spatial distributions and kinematical properties as well .",
    "the metal - poor group contains classical , population ii halo objects in terms of their location and space motions , in addition to their low metallicities .",
    "clusters in the metal - rich group , on the other hand , are mostly confined to the same volume of space as the galactic bulge .",
    "of the 33 clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath11 ( data from @xcite as updated in 2003 february ) , three - quarters of them lie within 20  of the galactic center , and half lie within 10  of the center .",
    "not surprisingly , these clusters are also heavily reddened ; the average @xmath12 of the sample that lies within 10  of the center is 1.41 , which is equivalent to an average visual extinction ( @xmath13 ) of 4.4 mag .",
    "the problems associated with optical studies of these clusters are further compounded by the fact that many of them lie in very crowded fields and are not themselves of high surface brightness or concentration .    an obvious question to ask concerning the metal - rich globular clusters",
    "is whether they are in some way physically associated with the bulge , sharing a common origin and evolution , as has been argued by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; or is the similarity in spatial distribution of the clusters and bulge stars merely coincidental and due simply to the influence of the same gravitational potential .",
    "if the former is the case , then knowledge of these metal - rich clusters would be particularly relevant in enhancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of the bulge itself .",
    "accurate abundance determinations for these clusters would be of particular importance .",
    "however , because of the difficulties associated with observing these clusters in the optical , spectroscopic abundances based on observations of individual stars are available for only a small fraction of those that lie closer than 15  from the galactic center .",
    "the situation is somewhat better in terms of deriving physical parameters from optical color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) ; of particular note is the program being carried out by ortolani and his collaborators ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in working toward this goal of learning more about these heavily reddened bulge clusters",
    ", we have recently developed a new method for the determination of [ fe / h ] for globular clusters based on the measurement of absorption features due to ca , na , and co in the @xmath0 band spectra of a few of the brightest giants in each cluster ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "the practical advantages of the near - ir technique we have developed are several and important .",
    "the necessary spectroscopic observations are at a resolution of only @xmath14 and need only be obtained for the brightest half - dozen or so giants in a cluster . knowledge of cluster reddening or distance is not needed , although if dereddened colors and absolute @xmath0 band magnitudes are known , the accuracy of the resulting [ fe / h ] value is further improved .",
    "furthermore , because of the close coupling between [ fe / h ] and the location and morphology of a cluster s red giant branch ( rgb ) , our technique is largely insensitive to the choice of stars so long as they are on the upper 3 or 4 mag ( @xmath0 band ) of the rgb .",
    "this advantage was also demonstrated in our study of giants in the field of the galactic bulge @xcite . in the @xmath0 band",
    "the giants near the top of a cluster s rgb are very bright in contrast to their relative faintness in @xmath15 , which is due to severe molecular blanketing . and , finally , a consequence of the previous fact is that the effects of crowding and confusion with field stars are significantly reduced .",
    "for this paper we chose seven poorly studied globular clusters located in or near the galactic bulge , which are believed to have [ fe / h ] @xmath16 and/or are heavily reddened . for five of these clusters ,",
    "our work is the first detailed spectroscopic study of individual cluster stars .",
    "table  [ tab : clusters ] summarizes some of the properties of these clusters .",

    "each spectrum begins as a set of @xmath54 individual spectra taken by stepping the star along the slit to eliminate the effects of uneven slit illumination , bad pixels , and fringing .",
    "the slit is several arc minutes long , which permits simultaneous star and sky measurements .",
    "the array response signature is first removed by dividing each of the individual frames by a dome flat field . the sky frame for each star",
    "is formed by median - combining the individual frames in each set , thus removing all traces of the star itself , and then subtracting it from each spectral frame .",
    "each spectra in a set is then extracted using the iraf apall routine .",
    "the final spectrum for a star is the average of the extracted individual spectra .",
    "the wavelength calibration for each star is determined by fitting to approximately 12 atmospheric oh lines @xcite visible on a sky spectrum , where the sky spectrum is extracted from the sky frame using the program star as an extraction template .",
    "we fit the observed wavelengths to the laboratory ones with a second order legendre polynomial .    to remove telluric absorption features from each final stellar spectrum , we divide them by a normalized standard star spectrum to correct for telluric absorption features and then multiply by a 10,000 k blackbody spectrum to restore the over all shape of the spectrum .",
    "these standard stars are of early a spectral type or hotter , with no significant spectral features in the observed wavelength regime , except for brackett @xmath55 at 2.16 @xmath56 m .",
    "they are observed as close in time and air mass as practical to the observations of each cluster star .",

    "ew(ca ) and ew(na ) have continuum regions on either side of the line absorption region and thus are independent of changes in the spectral slope due to reddening . there is no viable continuum region to the red of the co band head , so instead we extrapolate a linear fit to the continuum blueward of the feature and integrate the depth of the absorption under this extrapolated continuum .",

    "one important consideration is the potential contamination from superposed field stars . with a large sample of spectra it is possible to effectively reject a few non - members if their metallicities are sufficiently different from that of the cluster .",
    "however , with a reduced sample size it becomes impossible to distinguish between members and nonmembers .    a way to test the robustness of our metallicity determinations against small sample sizes is to run monte carlo simulations on some of the clusters that have larger samples , and therefore relatively well - determined metallicities . to simulate the results of only measuring @xmath70 stars in a cluster , we randomly select stars from the observed sample and average their metallicities to determine that of the cluster . by repeating this process @xmath71 times , we accumulate the distribution of errors , and can therefore estimate the accuracy and precision with which one can determine the cluster metallicity using only a sample of @xmath70 stars .",
    "two illustrative examples are the spectra of the clusters terzan  2 and terzan  4 . in terzan  4",
    "we measured seven stars that have a reasonably narrow distribution of metallicities ; therefore , picking even a few stars gives a reasonable result for the cluster . on average ,",
    "only measuring one star will give the correct answer , but the distribution of results has a sigma of 0.19 dex . averaging the results from two stars , the width of the distribution is reduced to 0.12 dex , and with three stars it drops to 0.09 dex .",
    "terzan  2 also has a relatively narrow distribution of metallicities , except that , of the seven measured stars , one appears to be a field star with a much higher metallicity . in our analysis in sec  [ sec : ter2 ] we recognize this fact , and disregard the outlier when determining our `` best '' value for the cluster .",
    "however , with a smaller sample , it would be much more difficult to recognize contaminants .",
    "this is shown in the simulations , where on average , the deviation from the `` best '' value is 0.16 dex . only measuring one star yields a distribution with a sigma of 0.42 dex",
    "; the mean of two stars give a sigma of 0.27 dex , three a width of 0.20 dex , etc .",
    "thus , the appropriate number of spectra for an accurate measure of the cluster metallicity ( where accurate means to within the accuracy of the technique ) appears to be most dependant on the severity of the non - member contamination . if one expects no contaminants , e.g. an isolated cluster , three stars are sufficient to reduce the stochastic noise inherent when using spectra of the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) presented here ( consistent with what was found in paper i ) .",
    "however , in more polluted regions , such as the galactic disk or bulge , more stars are required to be able to effectively reject non - members .",
    "furthermore , the number of stars required increases as the difference between the cluster metallicity and the contaminating population decreases .",
    "the calibration of the current technique used the metallicities listed in the 1999 version of the harris catalog @xcite of galactic globular clusters , which is a continually changing average of parameters taken from literature .",
    "thus , while harris started out on the @xcite scale , the catalog has been evolving as more and more values from high - resolution spectroscopy are incorporated .",
    "however there exist significant discrepancies observed between metallicities obtained with various techniques , and on the absolute calibration of the metallicity scale itself .",
    "the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter zw84 ) metallicity scale was one of the first such metallicity scales .",
    "calibrated primarily from the spectroscopy of cohen ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , it used photometric indices measured from cluster integrated light , and was applied to a total of 121 clusters",
    ". this scale has been updated by @xcite using low - resolution spectroscopic measurements of the red ca  ii triplet in individual giants .",
    "the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cg97 ) [ fe / h ] scale is based on a uniform analysis of high - resolution spectra of more than 160 bright red giants in 24 globular clusters .",
    "figure  5 of cg97 shows a comparison between their system and that of zw84 : a nonlinear relation where the zw84 values are @xmath72 dex too high at the metal - rich end ( [ fe / h]@xmath73 ) , and @xmath74 dex too low for clusters of intermediate metallicity ( @xmath75[fe / h]@xmath76 ) .    the recent work by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ki03 ) , using measurements of fe  ii in high - resolution spectra of giants in 16 clusters , confirms that the zw84 [ fe / h ] scale is nonlinear with respect to the true [ fe / h ] scale .",
    "their figure  3 shows the clearly nonlinear relation between theirs and the zw84 scale , regardless of the model atmosphere they choose .",
    "however , figure  2 of ki03 illustrates the comparison of their scale with that of cg97 , showing that the cg97 values are too high , with an offset of @xmath74 dex at the lowest metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath77 ) , and agreement at the highest ( [ fe / h]@xmath78 ) .",
    "since our calibration is not strictly based on any one of these three different metallicity scales , we have performed a comparison of the metallicities of the 15 clusters used to calibrate our technique .",
    "the results of this comparison are shown in figure  [ fig : calib ] .",
    "this shows that at low metallicities , cg97 gives values that tend to be higher than our calibration , and ki03 gives values that tend to be lower than our calibration . at higher metallicities , we are lower than zw84 , but not as low as ki03 .",
    "table  [ tab : calib ] summarizes the data in figure  [ fig : calib ] ; it includes the metallicity scale , the number of calibrating clusters measured on each system , the mean difference in metallicity , and the dispersion of the difference in columns ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) respectively . in the mean ,",

    "although it is most likely _ not _ due to @xmath62-enhancement , since the stars in @xmath1 cen have normal @xmath62-enhancement compared with other globular clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "looking at the observed relations of the measured equivalent widths in @xmath1  centauri , for example ew(co ) versus ew(na ) , ew(co ) versus ew(na ) , and ew(ca ) versus ew(na ) , we find that they are completely consistent with what was seen in the calibrating clusters of paper  i ( see for example figure  6 in paper  i ) .",
    "this indicates that , at least to within our measurement accuracy , the abundance ratios seen in these @xmath1  cen giants are not vastly different from what we measured for our calibrating galactic clusters .",
    "this is consistent with what has been measured for various elements using high - resolution spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ [ sec : co ] ] co ~~    in paper  i we observed a tight relationship between the spectroscopic co equivalent width and the photometric co index . taking the measurements of the photometric co index from @xcite , we find the same relation also holds true in @xmath1  centauri .",
    "figure  [ fig : wcenco ] shows the spectroscopic ew(co ) as a function of the photometric co index for all the stars measured in paper  i ( dots ) and the stars measured in @xmath1  cen ( open circles ) .",
    "both sets of data clearly follow the same relationship and are well modeled by a simple linear least - squares fit .",
    "the solid line is the fit to only the data from paper  i , while the dashed line is to both data sets , except for the stars with overplotted @xmath178 s , which are greater than @xmath179 outliers and are not included in the fits .",
    "the fit that includes both data sets has slightly smaller errors than what was derived in paper  i , and is given in equation  [ eqn : co ] .",
    "in this paper we present new metallicities for seven heavily reddened bulge globular clusters using medium - resolution infrared spectroscopy .",
    "table  [ tab : bestvalues ] summarizes these results .",
    "these clusters are some of the most difficult to study in the galaxy , and comparing our new measurements with previous values , we find several systematic trends as well as a few significant discrepancies .",
    "figure  [ fig : fehcomparison ] illustrates these differences and trends .",
    "here we plot our new metallicity determinations from table  [ tab : bestvalues ] with those from previous works listed in table  [ tab : clusters ] .",
    "the dots represent our measurements , where the uncertainties are taken to be @xmath84 dex , as discussed in section  [ sec : fehscale ] .",
    "the @xcite measurements are based on the strength of the red ca  ii triplet in the integrated cluster light .",
    "however , since galactic globulars are @xmath62-enhanced ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of @xmath62-enhancement in globular clusters ) , the [ @xmath92values of @xcite , which measure an overall metallicity , will be slightly higher than the iron abundance , [ fe / h ] . indeed , comparing with our final abundances",
    ", we find that in the mean , the @xcite values are systematically higher by @xmath181 dex ( see last row of table  [ tab : clusters ] ) .",
    "the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* az88 ) measurements , also based on the strength of the red ca  ii triplet , also give a large deviation from our final values : @xmath182 dex .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this large discrepancy .",
    "az88 calibrated their summed ca  ii equivalent width ( @xmath183 ) using a linear fit between @xmath183 and [ fe / h ] , as measured by @xcite for seven clusters .",
    "however , it is now known that the strength of the ca  ii lines shows a non - linear relationship with [ fe / h]@xmath184 , especially for [ fe / h]@xmath185 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section [ sec : fehscale ] ) .",
    "this poor calibration could certainly lead to overestimates of the metallicity ; however , the most likely explanation is simply contamination from surrounding metal - rich bulge stars .",
    "the harris catalog @xcite is an average of globular cluster parameters taken from the literature .",
    "it is maintained on the web at http://physun.physics.mcmaster.ca/globular.html . while originally on the @xcite scale , which appears slightly nonlinear and tends to overestimate the metallicities of the most metal - rich clusters , more recent versions of the catalog",
    "have incorporated many values from high - resolution spectroscopy and are thus closer to the @xcite scale ( see section [ sec : fehscale ] for a discussion of the various metallicity scales , and how our technique compares ) .    in general , the comparison of our values with those in the 2003 version of the harris catalog is very close ; the mean difference between the two sets of measurements is @xmath186 dex ( last line of table  [ tab : clusters ] ) , where the harris values are slightly higher than ours .",
    "the explanation behind the higher metallicities found in previous studies seems to be primarily contamination by metal - rich bulge stars ( see figure  [ fig : fehcomparison ] ) .",
    "the combination of very crowded fields , low - concentration clusters , and similar stellar luminosities makes it very difficult to distinguish between cluster members and superposed bulge stars .    the largest discrepancies between our new values and those in the harris catalog are those of ngc  6256 and liller  1 , which are listed with metallicities @xmath187 and @xmath188 dex higher than we measure , respectively .",
    "our lower values for both clusters are in good agreement with other recent studies .",
    "the harris catalog also lists palomar  6 with a metallicity of @xmath26 , taken from the ir spectra of @xcite , which is @xmath189 dex _ lower _ than we measure .",
    "see section [ sec : pal6 ] for a discussion of this cluster .    as a result of this study",
    "we have reduced by three the number of galactic globular clusters that have [ fe / h]@xmath190 according to the harris catalog .",
    "the metallicity of ngc  6256 was lowered to @xmath2 and ngc  6539 was decreased down to @xmath3 .",
    "terzan  2 , which lies within 10  of the galactic center , was reduced to [ fe / h]=@xmath7 .",
    "we have also observed 12 giants in the globular cluster @xmath1  centauri , all except one of which appear to lie in the intermediate- or metal - rich regions of @xmath1  cen s tri - modal metallicity distribution .",
    "we compare our results for the eight stars that have previous metallicity determinations and find general agreement , although some of the most recent optical spectroscopy finds slightly lower metallicities than we predict .",
