    "<S> , the dynamics of the system can be described in terms of incoherent population transfer with an effective transfer rate between the qe and the cavity given by @xcite : @xmath39 within this incoherent regime , we can further define a bad - cavity regime for @xmath40 ( labelled `` 2 '' in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ imap ] ) and a good - cavity regime for @xmath41 ( labelled `` 3 '' in fig .  [ imap ] ) @xcite . in the bad - cavity limit @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> , the cavity can be adiabatically eliminated , and its sole effect is to add a new channel of irreversible radiative emission at a rate @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> reabsorption by the qe is then negligible . </S>",

    "<S> applying eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ itls ] to this effective qe leads to an indistinguishability of @xmath45 within this regime of incoherently - coupled bad cavity , the usual strategy to increase indistinguishability is basically to maximize @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done by increasing @xmath12 and/or minimizing @xmath10 . however , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ibc ] , near - unity indistinguishability requires @xmath46 and consequently @xmath47.it is found that the coupling strength @xmath12 has to exceed @xmath11 by nearly one order of magnitude in order to reach an indistinguishability value of @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> reaching such coupling is technologically extremely challenging for solid - state emitters under ambient temperature . on the other hand , the incoherent good - cavity regime ( labelled `` 3 '' in fig .  [ imap ] ) </S>",
    "<S> occurs for @xmath41 . in this regime , the cavity can store the photons within a time scale comparable to or longer than the qe dephasing time . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity itself then acts as an effective emitter incoherently pumped by the qe @xcite , so that the cavity field correlations read @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the population of the cavity mode and @xmath51 is the linewidth of the cavity - like eigenstate . from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> [ corrgc ] and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ iformula ] , one finds an indistinguishability of @xcite : @xmath53 consequently , large indistinguishability occurs in this regime for @xmath26 and @xmath54 ( i.e. @xmath55 ) , in agreement with the full calculation shown on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ imap](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by noting that two ingredients are involved in the degradation of indistinguishability in this good - cavity regime where the cavity acts as the effective emitter . </S>",
    "<S> the first point is that the initial incoherent feeding of the cavity occurs on a time scale @xmath56 , producing a time uncertainty in the population of the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath10 has to be kept small compared to @xmath4 in order to prevent such time - jittering effect , in analogy to the incoherent pumping of qe via high energy states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second point is that , after the initial filling of the cavity , incoherent exchange processes between the qe and the cavity can still occur . </S>",
    "<S> however , back and forth incoherent hopping between the cavity and the qe leads to the dephasing of the photons emitted by the cavity . to prevent such detrimental hopping , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 is required .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the efficiency of the photon emission from the cavity mode , i.e. the probability to have emission by the cavity mode per initial excitation of the qe . </S>",

    "<S> near - unitary ( i.e. on - demand ) efficiencies are obtained in the upper - right corner . in the weak - coupling regime , we find @xmath58 efficiencies larger than 0.5 are typically obtained for @xmath59 and @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with high indistinguishability in the region of high @xmath12 and high @xmath10 values ( i.e. right - upper corner in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ imap ] ) , but not in the good cavity regime ( i.e. region `` 3 '' in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ imap ] ) . nevertheless , </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in the following , the product of efficiency and indistinguishability @xmath61 in the good cavity regime can still be way above the one obtained by any linear spectral filtering technique . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a linear spectral filter , with a narrow spectral range @xmath62 , through which the spectrum of the broad qe is sent . </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the output efficiency is bounded by @xmath64 . due to the fourier - transform condition , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding indistinguishability is bounded by @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the efficiency - indistinguishability product for spectral filtering can not exceed @xmath66 . in order to compare @xmath67 in the present cavity - qed scheme with the upper limit for spectral filtering </S>",
    "<S> , we define a cavity - funneling factor @xmath68 such that @xmath28 values larger than unity necessarly indicate a spectral cavity - funneling effect . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 indicates the minimum enhancement ratio of @xmath67 with respect to any spectral - filtering effect . in practice </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement will be larger since light emitted from a cavity can be very efficiently collected @xcite , in contrast to free - space spontaneous emission . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ imap](c ) , the funneling @xmath28 is plotted in the same parameter range ( @xmath10,@xmath12 ) as previous plots . only the values satisfying the cavity - funneling condition of @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> are shown . </S>",
    "<S> it appears clearly that almost - perfect indistinguishability in the good cavity regime is compatible with cavity funneling . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ comp ] , @xmath5 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are plotted as a function of @xmath10 for a fixed value of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the full calculation is found to be in good agreement with the above formulae for the incoherent regime . </S>",
    "<S> it illustrates the necessary trade - off between indistinguishability and efficiency in the good - cavity regime , where a clear maximum of the funneling factor occurs . </S>",
