    "mennickent et al . ( 2002 , hereafter m02 ) have reported the existence of a number of bright blue stars in the small magellanic cloud the light curves of which exhibit periodic or quasi - periodic variability in their ogle ( udalski et al .",
    "1997 ) @xmath3-band light curves . in an initial follow up of the investigation , mennickent et al .",
    "( 2006 ;  m06 \" ) noted that some stars exhibit peculiar spectroscopic properties and multiple periods .",
    "they gave initial estimates of spectral classifications based on low dispersion spectra , but they noted conflicting properties . in a companion study to this one , mennickent et al .",
    "( 2010 ; hereafter  m10 \" ) have selected two novel type3 variables - band light curves varying periodically or quasi - periodically . ] with novel properties named   ( @xmath4 smc - sc3 - 63371 , macho i d 213.15560 ; hereafter ) and   ( @xmath4 smc - sc4 - 67145 , macho i d 212.15735.6 ; hereafter ) .",
    "these type3 stars were chosen according to the sole additional arbitrary criterion that they are brighter than @xmath5 = 14.2 . the photometric analysis in m10",
    "was based on new ogle iii light curves and found that   exhibits a double - minimum period with a period of 238.1 days and a second quasi - period that fluctuates between two values each near 15.35 days .",
    "the appearance of the longer period , which exhibits minima at unequal spacings and unequal depths suggests the appearance of an ellipsoidal variable . the high orbital eccentricity implied by these properties",
    "is confirmed by the inference from the sharp and unequal light maxima that reflection effects from a secondary occur during brief periastron passages .",
    "the light curve of   reveals surprising periodic deep eclipses every 184.26 days , modulated over a superperiod of several cycles , and chaotic variability indicative of multiple shorter periods .",
    "m06 and m10 have open a variety of questions that can be pursued with high resolution spectra , which we undertake to pursue now .",
    "we have already remarked as one example that the spectra of   and   spectra are unusual in that they show properties of rather conflicting spectral types ( strong nad and strong h@xmath2 and h@xmath6 emission components ) .",
    "therefore , we obtained three high - dispersion optical spectra of   and   during the period 2002 - 9 . to obtain a better understanding of how the spectra appear at short wavelengths we obtained a _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) spectrum of both stars .",
    "these spectra and the _ fuse _ data form the basis of this investigation . the goal of our study is to elucidate the properties of the circumstellar environment of these objects and to pave the way to understanding the evolutionary state of this potential new subclass of ae stars .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we used the far - uv spectral atlas of b stars near the main sequence ( smith 2010 ) to identify a number of lines in our _ fuse _ spectra to measure radial velocities of the b stars at the time of our observations .",
    "the results for smc - sc3 and smc - sc4 are + 138 @xmath7 kms@xmath8 and + 136 @xmath9 kms@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "_ fuse _ spectra are prone to several systematic sources of errors in their wavelength calibrations ( dixon et al .",
    "2007 ) , and thus the zeropoint differences may easily be as large as @xmath10 kms@xmath8 .",
    "nonetheless , we noticed that the measured wavelengths of the same lines for the same spectra closely coincided in nearly all cases . on the basis of the spatial positions of the two dimensional spectra , we believe the apertures were placed consistently over the stellar images and that the radial velocity difference between the b star spectra is no more than 10 kms@xmath8 .",
    "much of the analysis in this paper relies on spectral line synthesis , so we first describe the methods used for this analysis .",
    "we have adopted the results of the fitting of the wings of the caii k - line and assumed stellar parameters for   and  , namely logg = 2.5 and 3 , which are appropriate for luminosity class i and ii mid - a stars , respectively , and a metallicity of 0.2@xmath11 solar ( e.g. , dolphin et al .",
    "2001 , mighell et al .",
    "1998 , dufton et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using the synspec and circus ( disk ) spectral synthesis programs ( hubeny , lanz , & jeffery 1994 , hubeny & heap 1996 ) .",
    "using circus , we were able to estimate rotational broadenings , vsin@xmath12 , from the absorption lines in both the _ fuse _ and optical spectra of our two program stars .",
    "for smc - sc3 the a primary and b secondary have broadenings of 20 @xmath13 kms@xmath8 and 50 @xmath14 kms@xmath8 . for smc - sc4",
    "the corresponding rotational broadenings for the a and b binary components are 28 @xmath13 kms@xmath8 and 75 @xmath14 kms@xmath8 .",
    "for circus analysis one must assume an input temperature for a putative intervening disk structure , @xmath15 , and several other parameters .",
    "the circus program permits as many as three separate absorbing or emitting regions to be specified , each with its own areal coverage , local temperature , and radial velocity .",
    "we utilized this feature in some cases to specify two distinct temperature regions , since the line identifications indicated that the lines we modeled arise in regions having a temperature range of 5 - 8kk . at these temperatures",
    "the fraction of the ions considered plateaus , and thus the errors in this parameter are not large .",
    "the strengths of disk components of the nad and ki profiles can be most easily modeled by temperatures of 5kk or less , consistent with the picture from the h@xmath2 emission profiles of the disks extending out to at least several stellar radii .",
    "nonetheless , our models show that the column densities required to fit these components decrease monotonically with temperature . thus these values are not well constrained .",
    "the strengths and widths of the feii and siii lines suggest a microturbulence @xmath16 of about 10 kms@xmath17 and we assumed the disk to be approximately keplerian . for lines having both photospheric and circumstellar components , these components exhibit no net shift .",
    "therefore , the latter structure appears to be in a keplerian orbit .",
    "we have also assumed that the foreground disk segment fully covers the star .",
    "however , if our lines of sight toward different portions of the star sample different disk conditions along the way , our column densities will be underestimated .",
    "these assumptions required the matching of the computed equivalent widths to the observations using a one or two parameter fit in disk and column densities .",
    "the columns needed to fit the observed line strengths and the strength ratios of lines arising from the same ion indicate that the strong disk lines we measured are optically thick . in some cases the lines",
    "are observed to have peak equivalent widths ( ews ) as large as we can compute them even from assumed optimal conditions .",
    "we note also that for the optical strong feii lines , we fit _ emission _",
    "profiles in our models with temperatures for a medium with a larger projected area than the star s - that is , as if they are formed in lines of sight that do not intersect the star disk .",
    "we will express the column densities in examples below by using the unit  stellar area . \"",
    "our modeling represents an oversimplification of the true and unknown disk conditions because the disk geometry and velocity fields are poorly known .",
    "in addition , the compututation of line strengths requires a common estimated excitation and ionization temperature .",
    "nonetheless , for exploratory purposes we believe that our models provide insight into the thermal and velocity differentiation within the disks .",
    "generally , departures from lte in the line transitions will result in an underpopulation of the higher levels relative to lower and resonance levels , and therefore an increase in the absorbing column density for lines arising from excited levels .",
    "we have computed our absorption column densities in this scattering approximation in our circus simulations .      in view of the implied complex nature of the structures surrounding both program stars",
    ", we will discuss quantitative fits to several line profiles mainly to get an idea of the column densities , radial velocities , and turbulences in the disk gas .",
    "except for a model fitting to the excited hei line and resonance lines ( which form in cold media which we can not specify accurately ) , we will limit our quantitative analysis to the optical metal lines arising from atomic levels of a few ev .",
    "because of the uncertainties involved , we discourage the reader from not interpreting our numerical results too literally .    nearly all the features in the optical spectra of smc - sc3",
    "are characteristic of absorptions in an extensive and flattened , differentiated disk or envelope .",
    "the high - level balmer and paschen lines can be resolved out to h30 ( fig.1a ) and p24 , but any disk contribution to them can not be well determined because these features are common in a supergiants spectra .",
    "our synspec simulations of these high atomic levels lead to estimates for the characteristic density in the line formation in the atmosphere of 1 - 3@xmath1110@xmath18 @xmath19 .    in our initial modeling",
    "we discovered that the disk temperature and therefore the column density through the disk along the line of sight can not be constrained to a single temperature , particularly for metallic absorption lines in the blue / near - uv region .",
    "for example , given assumed disk gas temperatures values of 6kk and 5kk , we are able to generate good circus fits to weak lines in the 3800 - 3850   region in our spectra with column densities of about 3@xmath1110@xmath20 @xmath21 or 7@xmath1110@xmath22 @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "these values carry uncertainties of at least a factor of three and assume full disk coverage of the star .",
    "we were able to get a better handle on these parameters by finding a region of the spectrum at 5250 - 5280   that contains both fei and feii intermediate strength lines .",
    "our modeling for the region of 5250 - 5280   is depicted in figure7 .",
    "the ionization temperature in the disk is already well constrained by the fei / feii ratio to be @xmath237kk .",
    "however , we found that to reproduce also the observed strengths of the features with a metallicity and column densities obtained for fits of our other line requires that lines of each ion be formed in media that favor each of their ionization states , rather than an intermediate value near 7kk .",
    "we were able to obtain reasonable fits for both disk spectra with a two - component model having t@xmath24 = 6kk and 8kk .",
    "( in reality this means that the disk is described by a continuous distribution warm to cooler temperatures . )",
    "the column densities given in fig.7 are generally a few times 10@xmath20 @xmath21 , consistent with our less refined analyses of the lines in the far blue .",
    "[ 1 ]    [ 1 ] .",
    "wavelengths are in the observed system for the 2002 epoch . , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    a salient attribute of the strongest feii lines of ,   ( which arise from a common multiplet having 2.9ev ) is that they exhibit broad absorption components and even broader emissions . certainly",
    ", the emission components and even much of the absorption does not appear to be photospheric .",
    "for example , among the strongest three lines , 5169 , 5018 , and 4923 the stronger the line , the more pronounced the absorption and overlying emission wings , a point which we now elaborate .    among the strong disk feii lines in this spectrum , we chose to fit the 5018  line , which is depicted in figure8 .",
    "our fit for this feature was achieved by confirming the column density of a disk from the emission component of a few feii lines .",
    "these lines are 4923 , 5018 , 5169 , 5316 .",
    "we estimated from their relative emission strengths that that they are mildly optically thick , @xmath25 @xmath26 3 . for the optical spectrum of smc - sc3",
    "this corresponds to a column density of 3@xmath1110@xmath20 @xmath21 and a temperature of 8kk .",
    "this is the same temperature and nearly the same column density as we found for the lines in fig.7 .",
    "this agreement allowed us to fit the absorption features of these feii lines straightforwardly .",
    "the full profile was fit in circus with a two temperature - component simulation .",
    "we fit the emission using the same column density and temperature as just found for the absorption component .",
    "next we needed to broaden the simulated emission feature by a gaussian macroturbulence of 70 kms@xmath8 .",
    "the amplitude of the emission required adding a free parameter , the emitting gas area , which we found to be 11 stellar areas in this case .",
    "we note here that we actually have no independent handle on the volumetric density of the matter in which the feii lines are formed . using the column lengths of @xmath263r@xmath27 , characteristic of the derived emitting areas ( @xmath2611 stellar areas ) , we can estimate characteristic densities of 3 - 10@xmath28 @xmath19 .",
    "values of this order of magnitude should not result in visible forbidden features , and indeed they are not seen .",
    "the siii and oi triplet in the   spectrum are formed in plasma with temperatures in the range 6 - 9kk as well .",
    "although their cores are sharp , and consistent with being formed in a medium distant from the star , their strong wings suggest a second component formed closer to the star .",
    "the nai d and ki multiplets in this spectrum have the same combination of sharp core and extended wings .",
    "this is also true for several of the feii lines and the sii 6347 , 6371  doublet , which have high optical depths and therefore characteristic mean formation sites in the outer disk where the temperature and column length are low . for the nai and ki lines we could fit the line cores with a column above the photosphere of 5@xmath1110@xmath22 @xmath21 for t@xmath24 = 4kk and 1.5@xmath1110@xmath20 @xmath21 for 5kk .",
    "we address next the remarkable emissions in the hei 5876 ,   6678 ,   and 7265   lines , all of which arise from 21ev levels .",
    "we show the stronger of these lines , 5876   and 7265 ,   in figure9 , corrected for their mean redshift of 32 kms@xmath8 .",
    "these lines are the only ones in the spectra of both stars that differ markedly from the other line system(s ) . the observed 5876/6678   line emission ratio is about 3 to 1 , which suggests that these lines are formed in an optically thin medium .",
    "such emissions are typically produced in a relatively dense plasma by heated gas , such as in shocks , or in much more energetic astrophysical venues ( like winds of be x - ray binaries ) by recombination .",
    "our simulations show varying efficiencies of formation in media of 15 to 23kk , with corresponding emission regions encompassing of 8 - 12 to 3 - 4.5 stellar areas and column densities of no more than 1 - 5@xmath1110@xmath20 @xmath21 for the two respective gas temperatures .",
    "if this heated gas undergoes continuous cooling down to 8kk , it is likely , given the small volume of formation implied by the hei emission widths , that the resulting emission generated in the feii lines would be hidden by the much broader feii emission component formed over the larger disk volume .    [ 1 ] , noted in table5 and is -74 km s@xmath8 from the average velocity of the features in the optical spectrum .",
    "note the near absence of velocity shifts between the two .",
    "the fluxes are 4-point smoothing of the raw data .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]      much of what we found for   is true also for , and we have already pointed out that the inferred temperature distribution for the disk around   is indistinguishable from the   disk . for",
    "the most part the column densities in our fits to the main ( unshifted ) metallic absorption line features run a factor of two to three times lower .",
    "for example , for a 6kk model the 3800 - 3850   lines could be fit with column densities of about 7@xmath1110@xmath22 @xmath21 and the feii lines in the 5250 - 5280   region by some 2@xmath1110@xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "most of the strong lines in this spectrum have profiles different from those of .",
    "the most noticeable difference is the presence of one and sometimes two discrete bacs in the smc - sc4 spectrum .",
    "these  bacs \" are so named because their morphology is reminiscent of the  dacs \" in resonance lines of radiation - driven winds of hot stars .",
    "a primary bac generally occurs at about -50kms@xmath8 to the blue of a redder or  main \" component , which we so name because the latter s velocity are coincident with the rvs of the high level balmer lines .",
    "the double entries in smc - sc4 columns of table5 indicate the commonness of single bacs throughout the optical spectrum .",
    "the yellow optical region is rich in intermediate strength feii lines with @xmath29 @xmath23 3 ev , and these lines show prominent bac strengths . for example , the fitting of bacs in the 5018   line in the uves spectrum required column densities of 3 - 10@xmath1110@xmath20 @xmath21 , or several times that of the main ( static ) components .",
    "this is largely because these components are mildly optically thick .",
    "the pattern of two bacs is common among the strongest of these 3ev feii lines . figs.11a and 11b exhibit double component pattern in the 5018  and 4923  lines , respectively . in both figures",
    "secondary \" bac shifted by about -100 kms@xmath8 relative to the main ( red ) component is conspicuous .",
    "the bac strengths for the feii lines can change over time , and fig.11a shows changes for the 4923  line . as expected , the strengths of bacs among various lines arising from the same ion and comparable excitation levels increase with line strength .",
    "bacs are relatively weak in lines arising from near - ground state atomic levels in low ionization species such as mgi , fei , and tiii .",
    "they are particularly noticeable in lines arising from moderately excited states of abundant metallic ions like feii , mgi , siii and even the oi 7771 - 5   triplet ( 9ev ) - see figure 10",
    ". the excited lines in the ni 8703 - 48 multiplet ( @xmath29=10ev ) exhibit a similar behavior as the oi triplet .",
    "many of the strongest lines , including the high order balmer lines , and the nai d and ki 7699   doublets at first seem to show a shading toward one wing or the other , depending on the epoch . however , as the 2007 mike spectrum makes clear in fig.2 , this tapering is due to the blending of two bacs . in this spectrum",
    "the  tapering \" is fully resolved into two sharp components .",
    "in addition to bacs , absorptions and emission components appear often in the extreme wings of the feii lines . however , their behavior is in some respects stranger than the bacs .",
    "both panels of fig.11 show that the flux in one of the wings can change from absorption to weak emission among members of the same multiplet in the same spectrum .",
    "the difference in the fluxes in the red wings of the 4923  and 5018  lines is particularly surprising because their difference in log@xmath30 is only about 0.1 dex .",
    "these differences can be seen even more dramatically in figure12a , again in the same spectrum .",
    "note in the blue wing the strongest line in a multiplet , 5169 , shows absorption .",
    "as one proceeds to the weaker members in the series , e.g. , 5316 ,   the wing exhibits the _",
    "strongest _ emission .",
    "the increased activity with time for the  weak \" 5316  line is exhibited in figure12b .",
    "this figure also shows weak absorption in the red wing , i.e. , the opposite wing in which emission is seen .",
    "other lines show this same behavior ( e.g. , fig.11b ) .    as one proceeds to higher excitation lines",
    "the secondary bacs disappear , and often so do the main components .",
    "figure13 shows vestigial red wing emissions of the excited siii 6347 , 6371  doublet similar to those just exhibited in the feii 5316   profile in fig.12b .",

    "the 6371   profiles have been shifted by -14.9   with respect to the 6347   for convenience . , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in figure12a we point out the curious difference between the bac and emission strengths of the same 2009 spectrum : whereas the strengths of bacs of lines in the same multiplet or supermultiplet increase as expected with oscillator strength , the strengths of the emissions go in reverse order ,",
    "that is , the strongest line ( @xmath315169 ) shows blue wing _ absorption _ and the weakest line shows the strongest emission .",
    "this is depicted in fig.12a , and the reversal can be seen in spectra from other epochs as well . _",
    "this behavior sets the far wing features apart phenomenologically from the bacs .",
    "_    we end this section by reporting that we encountered difficulties in attempting to fit the feii line emissions strengths of fig.12 with our circus models , even though it was easy to fit a similar emission in the siii profiles shown in fig.13 .",
    "the source of the problem is the combined constraints affecting the formation of the feii lines .",
    "as one increases the gas temperature in the models the feii emissions increase up to a point .",
    "however , above 9kk the flux emitted by a given gas volume decreases rapidly as the ionization of iron shifts to fe@xmath32 .",
    "above this temperature , regardless of the column density ( the lines are optically thick already ) , the emission requires increases in the emitting volume and therefore the area . in practice , an emitting area of at least 10 stellar areas",
    "is required  substantially higher values are needed for gas temperatures greater than 10kk or less than 8kk .",
    "these simulations bring out a contradiction according to our assumptions : _ whereas the blue wing absorption in the strong @xmath315169 line can be formed in columns subtending no more than one stellar area , the emissions of feii lines in the same multiplet must be produced in substantially larger areas and volumes and possibly different temperatures .",
    "_ clearly the formation of various components of the feii lines in this spectrum occurs in separate regions having diverse properties .",
    "we will return to this point in the next section .",
    "the primary attributes that initially drew our attention to the program stars were their multiple periods in the ogle @xmath3-band light curves .",
    "however , it was the complex nature of their optical spectra even at moderate resolution that led to this detailed spectroscopic analysis .",
    "we have already noted the strong double - peaked emission in h@xmath2 and other low members of the balmer series , which is uncharacteristic of an a star , even one of high luminosity .",
    "the acquisition of far - uv spectra has clarified that these objects are a + b luminous binaries , and three optical spectra have confirmed radial velocity variations for smc - sc4 .",
    "the current investigation discloses no new clues to the origin of the 15 day period of smc - sc3 or of the ",
    "chaotic \" photometric activity for smc - sc4 discussed in m10 .",
    "however , we can remark further on spectroscopic activity pertinent to the 184 day  eclipse \" period .",
    "in @xmath333.3.1 we expressed doubts as to how far the rv variations from the optical lines of smc - sc4 can be interpreted .",
    "for example , given the extreme changes in line profiles in the 2009 spectrum , it is not clear that we can trust the cross - correlation among spectra of different epochs to faithfully represent the motion of the a star around its orbit .",
    "we also note that in the only blue balmer line covered in all three observations , h@xmath34 , the wings suggest that the rv variations are larger than 100kms@xmath8 . for this reason we do not trust these few measurements to estimate binary orbit attributes such as eccentricity and inclination reliably . nonetheless , reasonable to infer that the rv variations are due to the same 184 day eclipse period discussed by m10 , even though the eclipses are almost certainly not due to the secondary star .",
    "we will comment on further on this geometry in  4.4 .",
    "if one adopts kepler s third law for the   orbit 18m@xmath35 and a 184 day binary period , one finds a semimajor axis for the binary systm of 1.66au .",
    "considering next the disk , if one assume keplerian orbits and adopts a measured separation between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 emission components in the h@xmath2 profile of 110 kms@xmath8 , the characteristic orbital radius for the disk becomes 4.9 sin@xmath36 au .",
    "furthermore , the well resolved nature of the two emission peaks implies once again that the sin@xmath37 factor is not far from unity . then assuming further only that the disk and orbital planes are at least roughly coincident , the ratio of the size of the disk to distance between the stars is about a factor of 2 - 3 ( 4.9sin@xmath38/1.66 ) .",
    "the conclusion is that in fact the emitting gas arises in a _",
    "circumbinary _ ( cb ) disk around the smc - sc4 system",
    ". confirmation of this picture comes from the fact that the v / r emission ratio of the h@xmath2 profile of   changes from the 2002 to the 2007 epoch even at near - like binary phases .",
    "we would expect the details of the emission profile to be different if the emission came from the environment of one of the binary components .",
    "we use the descriptor  circumbinary \" hereafter to describe the structure causing the disk emission and most of the exophotospheric absorptions in its spectrum .",
    "we have not made the case for rv variability for smc - sc3 , but given the discovery of its b secondary this seems to be a matter of discovery given our poor phase sampling .    as for",
    ",   if one again takes the sum of masses as 18m@xmath35 and a period of 238 days , one derives a semimajor axis of 5.4au of the system .",
    "this is larger than the scale of the   system , but then the h@xmath39 emission is some four times stronger for   ( table3 ) , which implies a more extensive disk outside this radius .    altogether , the high resolution spectra have revealed a number of novel properties that are different for each star and yet reminiscent and of one another .",
    "the two stars , and the overarching question is how the evolutionary state of the binaries and the remarkably slow rotations of the component stars might be responsible .",
    "these novel properties include emission , the unusual excitations implied by the emissions in hei (   only ) , siii , and feii lines , and for   the presence of multiple components , including  bacs \" in the strong resonance and intermediate strength lines , and emission components in permitted feii and siii lines ,    before evaluating the spectra of of our program stars further , we should state our assumptions about the dynamics of the binary - wind system that will facilitate consideration of the simplest possible picture that at the same time is consistent with the complex features we see . because of their presume relatively high space density in the region of the smc first investigated , we assume that both program stars are immediately post - main sequence .",
    "we have also assumed that m@xmath40 @xmath23 m@xmath41 , and this is based on the absence of any evidence of extensive mass transfer , anomalous abundances , or rotational spin up .",
    "the stellar radii we determined particularly from the surface gravities inferred from the caii and ciii lines suggests that the stars radii are much smaller than their roche lobes .",
    "this leads to the simplifying picture that , except for wind - wind or wind - cb disk interactions , the wind kinematics and geometries are not differ radically from those of single stars .",
    "of course , the fate of wind efflux stopped by collisions with the other wind or a disk , as suggested by shock features , suggests a more complex scenario .",
    "we assume that the residual momentum of the b star wind forces some of this stalled matter to the a primary , perhaps in a relatively narrow neck defined by the inner lagrangian point .",
    "if any matter also returns to the b star it would not be observed in our optical spectra .",
    "the h@xmath2 emissions in both program stars are strong but not at the high end of the range among classical and pre - main sequence be stars .",
    "the presence of h@xmath2 emission has long been used to confine the cool limit  be phenomenon \" in the hr diagram .",
    "jaschek et al .",
    "( 1988 ) have surveyed a large number of galactic ae stars , and even the class most resembling our program stars in having a rich optical shell spectrum , their  group ii , \" is confined to types a0-a1 .",
    "the emission profiles of those early a supergiants are weak , transient , and have a p cygni , or inverse p cygni , shape ( e.g. , verdugo 2005 ) , characteristic of activity close to the stars surfaces . for our program objects the continuum fluxes of the b secondaries",
    "are several times smaller in the red than the primaries fluxes",
    ". it strains credibility to imagine that the a stars or for that matter the b stars photospheric uv fluxes can excite such strong emission .",
    "emission in the h@xmath2 line is invariably generated by recombination in dense circum - stellar / binary environments of hot stars .",
    "yet the extended wings of these features hint at the importance of electron scattering , and this implies that the disk extends to low densities and large radii .",
    "the presence of @xmath0 , @xmath1 emissions in strong feii lines of smc - sc3 is a characteristic in a number of well - known classical be stars , these spectroscopic signatures are formed by scattering in dense , high optical - depth disks as well .",
    "an important characteristic of these emission profiles is that they remain almost symmetric in our observations , suggesting a stationary disk .",
    "however , a small persistent excess in the @xmath1 emission may hint at a few kms@xmath8 expansion of this structure . separate from these considerations ,",
    "the superposition of broad absorption profiles of strong feii ( e.g. , fig.8 ) and other excited lines like the siii doublet suggests the presence of a separate absorbing source close to the a star component of smc - sc3 .",
    "a clue to understanding the energetics of the disk of smc - sc3 is the presence of hei lines from the primary s photospheric and circumbinary lines . as with the hydrogen emissions",
    ", these lines can not be excited by the photospheric radiation field .",
    "a ready alternative is the shocks provided between wind - wind collisions between the stars . in the absence of profiles of the uv resonance lines , this is still a speculative idea .",
    "nonetheless , the fact that the velocities of the hei lines are so different from all the absorption line velocities indicates that they are formed in a different physical region that need not even be confined to the disk plane . from our fittings of the strengths of hei ( @xmath333.5 )",
    ", we found that for plasma heated to 18kk , a column length of 3@xmath1110@xmath20 cm @xmath8 is typical . adopting a value of n@xmath42 @xmath26 10@xmath18 @xmath19 , typical of cs disks of be and ae stars , the column length implies a radial extent of 3@xmath1110@xmath43 km ( @xmath262% of the a star s radius ) for the formation region ; if the temperature this extent could be much less .",
    "this is consistent with shock formation and inconsistent with mechanisms that excite helium atoms over a large volume , e.g. , irradiation by x - rays .",
    "the kinematics of the disk surrounding the   system are quite different from the .",
    "for example , the metallic lines do not show a symmetric two ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) component emission that suggests the presence of a stationary disk nor that the optical depths of the circumstellar or circumbinary absorptions have as high optical depths .",
    "in contrast , there are the blue and occasionally red absorption components , as well as emissions in the wings of the main line whose positions seem to be determined by the orbital phase .    although ubiquitous , novel , and likely present at all orbital phases , the bac features are not unique to the   system . in a little noted discovery ,",
    "heydari - malayeri ( 1990 ) reported that many of the metallic absorption lines in the optical spectrum of the smc supergiant n82 consist of double components , the dominant member of which is blueshifted by about -46 kms@xmath8 .",
    "this is almost the same value found for .",
    "the balmer lines also show double - peaked emissions intermediate in strength between those we find smc - sc3 and smc - sc4 .",
    "in addition , heydari - malayeri found that lines of different ions have various red to blue emission component ratios .",
    "this caused the rvs of members of ions exhibiting these components to have a large rv scatter .",
    "this author classified n82 as a  sgb[e ] \" star largely on the basis of the presence of infrared emission and the appearance of [ fe ] emission lines .",
    "however , an important supporting justification for the author s classifying n82 as be rather than ae was the star s strong balmer line emissions . because we now know that this is not necessarily a _",
    "sine qua non _ criterion for be classification , the argument that this object is a b star is weakened .",
    "the presence of [ fe ] emission in the spectrum of n82 but not in our program star spectra suggests that n82 s attributes are phenomenologically distinct . however , its spectrum is similar in including bac components in metallic lines and substantial emission in the lower balmer lines .",
    "overall , the striking attributes of the bac - like components in the   spectrum are :   _ a ) _ their ubiquity among many types of lines , _ b ) _ their consistent blueshifts of -50 to -32 kms@xmath8 in at least three orbital phases , and _",
    "c ) _ their concentration mainly among lines arising from atomic levels of a few ev .",
    "points _ a _ and _ b _ argue that the bacs appear the same around the orbital cycle and are perhaps caused by impacts of an axisymmetric outflow .",
    "we also found , depending on the epoch , that absorptions in either the far blue or red wings of some feii lines show an extraordinary sensitivity to excitation and line strength .",
    "the flux in emission features exhibits a reversed dependence on the line s oscillator strength , with the weaker lines showing the greater emission .",
    "the sensitivity of emissions to line strength fits in with the shock hypothesis because it implies a rapid increase in local temperature , perhaps over only 10@xmath44 km in the case of the 3ev feii lines , in the formation length where the emissions of ( weaker ) lines are formed .",
    "the sensitivity to line strength and excitational information also hints that the energy input into the putative shocks has a small  bandwidth , \" that is , if the outflows were less or more energetic then some other range of excited states would be collisionally populated .",
    "this is consistent with the wind energetics because winds have a characteristic velocity when they impact stationary matter at a fixed distance .",
    "according to these ideas , one expects the excitations of atoms exhibiting emission to depend on the wind velocities , and thus to some degree also the orbital separation between the stars .",
    "perhaps these conditions are  just right \" for smc - sc3 to excite lines at @xmath2320 - 25ev ( hei lines ) .      from the dissimilar nature of the optical and far - uv spectrum ( and the rv variations for ) , we have been obliged to adopt a binary model involving nearly two equal mass a + b components . the strong double - peaked emission in the h@xmath2 line against the continuum of an a bright giant or supergiant implies the presence of a flattened keplerian disk .",
    "the amplitude of the radial velocity variations compared to the almost stationary balmer emission cores shows that at least in   the h@xmath2-emitting structure is a circumbinary structure .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility of rv variations in   on the basis of their apparent consistency in just three observations .",
    "indeed , the requirements to produce blueshifted hei line emission suggest unusual energetics in a region that has a different radial velocity than the a star .",
    "the orbital separation of the binary components , estimated above for to be @xmath231.7sin@xmath45 au , is about @xmath46-@xmath47 of the characteristic cb disk radius .",
    "the absence of forbidden emission or metastable absorption lines argues that most of the disk does not have a low density .",
    "the optical / ir colors imply that reddening from cool dust is negligible .",
    "we envision that each of the binary component stars has a radiative wind , with the a star s wind being weaker , slower , and perhaps denser near its surface .",
    "10@xmath4810@xmath49 m@xmath35 yr@xmath8 and a terminal velocity of 1000 - 2000 kms@xmath8 .",
    "typical values for winds of a supergiants are thought to be @xmath5010@xmath51 m@xmath35 yr@xmath8 and 300 kms@xmath8 ( e.g. , verdugo 2002 ) . ]",
    "these winds will interact along an annulus centered on the line connecting the two stars .",
    "the shock - heating in this wind will show a maximum intensity at velocities in between those of the stars , though not necessarily at the barycenter .",
    "this would explain the displacement of emission of the hei lines for   and feii lines for .",
    "the wind continuously replenishes the cb disk , but we have no direct estimate of the relative amounts of disk or post - shock matter returning to the two stars or of it escaping through the outer edge of the cb disk .",
    "the symmetric emissions in the feii and other lines in the   spectrum have a separate origin , and probably originate in the quasi - stationary cb disk .",
    "apart from the 1 - 2 bac pattern in the spectrum of  , far wing absorptions appear in the opposite wing from far wing emissions ( @xmath333.6 ) .",
    "their juxtaposition suggests a common origin for these two non - bac features . we suspect that their complex morphology arises from their formations along different sight lines to the a star and to flowing cs streams in the sky plane .",
    "this complicated behavior is reminiscent of red- and blueshifted components in time - resolved ultraviolet spectra in algol systems .",
    "peters & polidan ( 1984 , 1998 ) have noted the existence of flows associated with  high temperature accretion regions \" caused by streaming of wind efflux from the cool giant star as it expands and transits through the binary s inner lagrangian point .",
    "this stream collides with a disk around the receiving hot secondary .",
    "this is the reverse of the present context , in which the receiver is the cooler star . in the present case",
    "we envision that the collision points occur behind the orbiting primary and generate shocks .",
    "these are manifested in spectra as doppler shifted emission components .",
    "disk matter cools and eventually falls into the cool ( a - type ) star , rather than only through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "the result is a complex array of relatively high velocity blue- and redshifted emission and absorption components that change their morphology around the orbital cycle .",
    "the high positive velocities compared to the a star in the 2009 spectrum ( fig.11b , 12a ) indeed suggests that matter falls toward the a star as seen from its trailing side , as peters & polidan found for the algols .",
    "one aspect of this picture is that it predicts that the shock geometry can be complex and not necessarily repeatable from the cycle to cycle . even at the same time",
    "the volumes producing emission for lines of different ions are not the same .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the infalling matter inferred from our 2009 spectra of   is associated with the observed eclipses .",
    "actually , any such picture must be complicated because it is the  wrong \" ( 2007 ) spectrum which nearly coincides with the egress from a continuum light eclipse .",
    "this would suggest that the stream spirals nearly a complete circuit ( some 65 - 90% ) around the a star until it settles onto the star ( the 2007 spectrum was obtained beyond the midpoint and during the egress of a photometric eclipse ; see table 1 here and figure6 in m10 ) .",
    "spectroscopically , this may be the cause of the second blueshifted absorption component of the strongest lines ( e.g. , dashed line in fig .",
    "2 , solid line in fig.11b ) . at this binary phase",
    "the blue component might actually be a better measure of the a star s velocity in orbit .",
    "the 2009 spectrum was taken at the opposing phase , an infall phase in this picture , before the matter has piled up and settled to the surface , at this phase the light curve registers only a broad , small - amplitude depression .",
    "we note that our picture has some similarities with that presented by soszynski ( 2007 ) to explain eclipses in interacting binary systems composed of red giants and low mass stars in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "even as luminous variables in the smc , our two program stars exhibit a extraordinary set of photometric and spectroscopic properties .",
    "these include a multiperiodic photometric variability , a @xmath23b3 type spectrum in the fuv , an optical a - type spectrum with balmer emission lines and metallic lines from an intervening disk",
    ". for smc - sc4 the spectral anomalies include the presence of one and sometimes two discrete blue absorption components ( bacs ) in metallic lines and rv variations .",
    "we have remarked that the optical spectrum of the smc supergiant n82 in the smc exhibits bacs and strong h@xmath2 emission .",
    "however , unlike n82 , neither of our stars shows forbidden lines . because uv spectra are not available for n82 , nor an optical rv campaign mounted , its suggested binary nature has not been tested .",
    "we argue that our program stars reflect a comparatively brief stage in the life of intermediate mass @xmath26 9 m@xmath52 binary components . with separations of a few au between the components ,",
    "the winds of the two stars can interact and produce a large array of spectroscopic phenomenology .",
    "this phenomenology can include emissions in lines of intermediate and/or highly excited ions ( e.g. , hei ) and time - variable pattern of sharp absorptions , in addition to the bacs .",
    "it is an open question why as many as two objects have such similarly unusual properties from a sample of only bright eight mennickent type3 variables . in any case",
    "we may dub these objects prototypes of a presumably small group of magellanic cloud wind - interacting a + b binaries .",
    "we speculate that the emission components originate from the interaction of that component of the a and b star winds in the zone near the line that intersects the centers of the two stars .",
    "the double peaked emissions in the balmer lines disclose an emitting keplerian disc , which from the peak separation has a larger extent than the binary separation .",
    "we have suggested , in part because of the hei line emissions in the   spectrum , that wind - wind interactions cause localized heating and ionizing photons capable of exciting the observed level of h@xmath2 model .",
    "the feii line emission strengths are _ anticorrelated _ with the line s oscillator strengths .",
    "we have attributed this extraordinary circumstance to their formation in a geometrically thin but optically thick and two layered column , where emission is formed in the deeper hotter shock and the absorption is just outside this region ( though in the foreground of the observer s sight line ) .",
    "we have also speculated that wind - wind interactions in the zone between the stars collisionally excite hei line emission and also produce balmer emission in the quasi - keplerian circumbinary disc .",
    "we have surmised that the primary bac ( absorption ) feature is caused by the violent impact of the expanding a star wind into this cb disk .",
    "however , although we do not have enough observations to characterize the time - dependent secondary components well , it appears that the strengths of the emission components in either one of the far wings of the 3ev feii lines are physically associated with absorptions in the opposite far wing .",
    "we have speculated that a rich line profile variability , including the so - called secondary bacs and emission components , is a consequence of a matter stream originating from the wind of the b star and settling on the a star .",
    "this is a reverse algol scenario in which matter is not constrained to flow only through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "perhaps this settling processes is responsible for the eclipses in the continuum light curve of smc - sc4 .",
    "a number of observing programs can be suggested to test these ideas and conceivably offer new alternatives :    * a high - resolution monitoring of these objects should be undertaken to construct a radial velocity curve and determine the periods , separations , and inclinations of these systems .",
    "these same data can be used to trace the velocities of the various components in the primaries spectra . for   the features of interest",
    "are the bacs and the pairs of absorptions and emissions in the wings of the feii lines . for   it",
    "is important to determine whether the velocity of the hei lines is constant or shows a small amplitude variation around the system s velocity .",
    "* uv observations of the prominent resonance lines are needed to characterize the wind strength , velocity , and its behavior through the orbital cycle .",
    "we expect that these features are diagnostics of the b star s wind",
    ". it may also be possible to trace velocity changes in signatures of the a star s wind , such as an arguably caii k emission feature ( fig .",
    "4b ) . in general",
    ", we expect the profiles of the uv resonance lines to be highly complex and variable . *",
    "any understanding of these particular objects rests on the expansion and adequate definition of this class , which in term entails finding more members .",
    "so far our small sample is drawn from a group of luminous optical / ir variables in the smc .",
    "one prong of this search would be to find stars whose spectra exhibit bacs .",
    "to date we have obtained moderate resolution spectra of a number of luminous b stars in the ogle surveys of both clouds .",
    "we find that two lmc stars have properties similar to our two prototype objects .",
    "these are ogle05141821 - 6912350 and ogle00552027 - 7237101 .",
    "in addition , mennickent et al .",
    "( 2010 ) noted that the object ogle lmc lpv-41682 ( p = 219.9 days ; soszynski 2010 ) exhibits modulated eclipses similar to those of .",
    "spectra of the two first objects display a range of h@xmath2 emission profile intensities , strong absorptions among high level lines , and variable ( possibly regular ) light curves .",
    "although the resolution of these spectra is sufficient to show at least strong forbidden emission lines , none are visible .",
    "if many of these stars are members of the group exemplified by   and , it will indicate that their properties are not isolated to a particular evolutionary age and/or angular momentum state .",
