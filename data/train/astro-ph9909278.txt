    "x - ray emission lines are powerful diagnostics of the physical conditions and structure in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the picture emerging from many x - ray studies of agns over the last couple of decades is that emission features in the x - ray spectra become scarce in agns with 210 kev intrinsic luminosity exceeding @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "this trend is discussed at length in nandra _",
    "( 1996 , 1997a ) and reeves _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the transition to a featureless x - ray power - law continuum in the vast majority of the high luminosity agns is not fully understood , but may be related to the complete ionization of matter responsible for emission - line features and/or beaming of the x - ray continuum swamping out emission - line features .",
    "any emission features observed in type 1 agn are almost always fe - k lines , although there are a handful of reports of other features ( george , turner , and netzer 1995 ; fiore _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; turner , george and nandra 1998 ) , all in low - luminosity agns . however , yaqoob _ et al . _",

    "the line energy was 1.6 kev in the rest - frame and was interpreted as highly blueshifted ovii .",
    "in this paper we report another x - ray emission - line feature at an unexpected energy , in the radio - loud quasar pks  2149@xmath0306 ( @xmath11 ) . with @xmath10",

    "the _ asca _ ( _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ; tanaka , inoue and holt 1994 ) observation of pks  2149@xmath0306 reported here has also been studied by siebert _",
    "( 1996 ) and cappi _ et al . _",
    "the emission line is visible by eye in their work , but went unnoticed because it is common practice to only search for emission lines at energies one would expect .",
    "_ asca _ observed pks  2149@xmath0306 on 1994 october 2627 for a duration of @xmath12 ks .",
    "the reader is referred to tanaka _",
    "( 1994 ) for details of the instrumentation aboard _",
    "asca_. the two solid state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) , hereafter sis0 and sis1 , with a bandpass of @xmath13 kev , were operated in 1-ccd faint and bright modes .",
    "the two gas imaging scintillators ( gis ) , hereafter gis2 and gis3 , with a bandpass of @xmath14 kev , were operated in standard ph mode .",
    "the data reduction procedures follow exactly those described in yaqoob _",
    "( 1998 ) and the reader is referred to that paper for the details of the data reduction , relevant calibration , other systematic uncertainties , and screening criteria .",
    "screening resulted in net ` good ' exposure times in the range @xmath1519.9 ks for the four instruments .",
    "images were accumulated from the screened data and they were examined for possible nearby contaminating sources .",
    "no such sources were detected .",
    "source events were extracted from circular regions with radii of 4 for the sis and 6 for the gis .",
    "background events were extracted from off - source regions . as a check , background spectra were also made from a 1-ccd mode blank - sky observation which resulted from the non - detection of the quasar iras 15307 + 3252 ( observed 1994 july ) .",
    "these background data were subject to identical selection criteria and used to check the invariance of the spectral results for pks  2149@xmath0306 described below . the count rates in the accumulated background - subtracted spectra for pks  2149@xmath0306 ranged from @xmath160.30 ct / s .",
    "spectra were binned to have a minimum of 20 counts per bin in order to utilize @xmath17 as the fit statistic .",
    "the _ asca _ lightcurves do not show significant variability , the highest excess variance ( e.g. see nandra _",
    "1997b ) we obtain is from sis0 and has the value @xmath18 for 128 s bins .",
    "this is to be compared with @xmath19 we obtain for the highly variable seyfert 1 mcg @xmath06@xmath030@xmath015 from a 4 day _ asca _ observation .",
    "we fitted spectra from the four _ asca _ instruments simultaneously in the range 0.510 kev with a simple power - law plus cold , neutral absorber model .",
    "a total of two interesting parameters were involved ( the photon index , @xmath20 , and column density , @xmath21 ) , plus four independent instrument normalizations .",
    "( the deviation of any of the four normalizations from their mean was less than 7% ) .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "the best - fitting photon index , @xmath22 , is consistent with that reported by siebert _",
    "( 1996 ) and cappi _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) and is rather flat .",
    "the column density , @xmath21 , is at least a factor 3 higher than the galactic value of @xmath23 obtained from dickey and lockman ( 1990 ) .",
    "the instrument - averaged _ observed _ 0.5 - 2 kev and 210 kev fluxes are 3.6 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the 210 kev luminosity in the source frame is @xmath25 ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "although the above simple continuum model provides an adequate fit , inspection of the ratios of data to model ( figure  1 ) reveal a statistically significant ( see below ) ` hump ' at @xmath28 kev ( observed frame ) in both sis0 and sis1 .",
    "we repeated the four - instrument _ asca _ fits with the addition of a simple gaussian to model the apparent emission - line feature .",
    "three extra parameters were involved , namely the line center energy , @xmath29 ; the gaussian intrinsic width , @xmath30 , and the line intensity , @xmath31 . _ note that we will refer to all three parameters , plus the equivalent width ( ew ) , in the quasar frame_. initially we allowed all three parameters to float but the line width was not constrained ( the best fit giving @xmath32 kev with only @xmath33 relative to the case for a narrow line ) . the results for a narrow - line fit with @xmath30 fixed at 0.01 kev are given in table 1 .",
    "note that the decrease in @xmath17 compared to the model without an emission line is @xmath34 for the addition of two free parameters so the line feature is detected at a confidence level greater than 99% .",
    "it is appropriate here to use a @xmath35 criterion to derive 90% confidence errors on the best - fitting line parameters since we want to know the bounds on @xmath29 and ew , independently of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( e.g. see yaqoob 1998 ) .",
    "we obtain , approximately , @xmath36 kev and @xmath37 ev .",
    "we also tried fitting sis0 and sis1 with a narrow line separately and obtained @xmath38 and 6.8 respectively . from figure 1",
    "it appears that @xmath39 should be higher for sis0 , not sis1 .",
    "however , these results are for a _ narrow line_. the sis0 data , which have the better statistical quality , prefer a somewhat broader feature .",
    "we also fitted a narrow line to the gis2 plus gis3 data only , this time with the energy fixed at 17 kev , and obtained a 90% ( @xmath40 ) upper limit on the intensity of @xmath41 , consistent with the intensity in table 1 .",
    "the feature is not obvious in the gis ; this is not surprising and it is quite common for weak fe - k lines in agn to be detected in the sis but not the gis .",
    "the gis count rates are a factor 1.52 lower than the sis ( due to larger off - axis angles ) and the energy resolution is a factor @xmath42 times worse .",
    "we also examined public archive data from a _ bepposax _ observation of pks  2149@xmath0306 performed in october 1997 .",
    "no line was detected but the data do not rule it out . again , the count rates ( in the mecs ) were much lower than sis ( a factor of @xmath43 less ) and the energy resolution worse by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "since an emission - line feature like that reported above has never before been observed in any agn , we sought explanations which did not require the line to be intrinsic to the quasar .",
    "firstly , is it possible that some or all of the x - ray emission is due to another source ?",
    "pks  2149@xmath0306 is in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey bright source catalog but no other x - ray source is found within 11 arcmin .",
    "however , the cambridge apm shows up an extended source only 2 arcmin away , of similar optical magnitude .",
    "this source was not found in either the simbad or ned databases and remains a mystery . in case",
    "this latter source is absorbed but still contributing to the hard x - rays , we compared the psf of the _ asca _ pks  2149@xmath0306 data with the psf for a bright point source ( 3c 273 ) , and also with the psf of an extended source ( the cluster e0657@xmath056 , see yaqoob 1999 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "data are fully consistent with the x - ray emission from a single point source corresponding to pks 2149@xmath0306 .",
    "we also note the bright cluster @xmath44 arcmin away , abell 3814 , can not be responsible for contamination of the _ asca _ data either . besides , its redshift is 0.118 so the fe - k line complex would be observed around 6 kev , whereas we observe the emission line in pks  2149@xmath0306 at @xmath45 kev .    to demonstrate that the sis calibration is not responsible we examined sis data from an observation of the x - ray binary 4u 1957@xmath4611 , performed @xmath42 days after the pks  2149@xmath0306 observation .",
    "figure 3 shows the ratios of data to a simple power - law plus absorber model ( both sis0 and sis1 ) fitted over the 210 kev range .",
    "it can be seen that no emission line feature at 5.1 kev is present in these data .",
    "we also made new sis spectra for pks  2149@xmath0306 artificially changing the gain by @xmath47 .",
    "this did not change the results - the emission line was still present , with insignificant effect on the line parameters .",
    "there is the remaining possibility that some other , unknown instrumental artifact , occurring only during the pks 2149 observation , was responsible for producing or mimicking an emission line .",
    "we consider this highly unlikely , however , particularly as the line is clearly detected in both sis .    the emission line can not be a background feature ( for example from galactic diffuse emission ) because the background from nearby regions in the same field and at the observed energy of the emission line in the sis lies at least a factor 20 below the on - source spectrum . also , we repeated the spectral analysis using the alternative background spectra made from a blank field , as described in  2 , and the results were confirmed to be robust to the background used .",
    "it is unlikely that the emission line is produced in an intervening galaxy since that galaxy would have to be extremely bright for the emission line to be detectable above the quasar continuum , with a redshift of @xmath48 .",
    "such a galaxy would be bright enough that signatures in the optical would have been detected .",
    "finally , we can ask , what is the chance probability that a line - like feature is detected in _ both _ sis0 and sis1 , due to random statistical fluctuations , if we examine a sample of high - redshift quasars ? suppose the quasar spectra have @xmath49 energy bins .",
    "the probability of finding a _ positive _ fluctuation , relative to some continuum model , of more than @xmath50 ( i.e. about the level of detection in _ each _ sis for pks  2149@xmath0306 ) , in one or more energy bins , in sis0 say , is @xmath51^n$ ] where @xmath52 ( assuming a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "then the probability that the same feature is detected at more than @xmath50 in sis1 , in the same energy bin is @xmath53^n)$ ] .",
    "note that the @xmath54 detection in _ each _ sis is consistent with the @xmath55 net detection as indicated by the @xmath39 from the spectral fits ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we examined all quasars with @xmath56 , for which the _ asca _ data were public as of 1998 , december 4 .",
    "this amounted to 87 observations of 86 sources .",
    "of these , only 31 datasets yielded spectra which were of sufficient quality to search for line - emission ( specifically , we defined this so that the sis0 spectrum had to be brighter than 0.05 ct / s ) . assuming the highest value for the number of bins in each sis spectrum ( @xmath57 ) in order to get the most conservative estimate",
    ", we obtain @xmath58 .",
    "thus , of the 31 datasets we expect less than one ( 0.69 ) to yield an emission - line in both sis0 and sis1 from random fluctuations alone . then , for the 31 spectra , we measured the @xmath39 resulting from inserting a narrow gaussian emission line at 100 energies between 0.5 and 8 kev for each dataset , relative to a simple power - law plus galactic absorption continuum model , fitted simultaneously to four instruments .",
    "we found four sources for which @xmath59 ( i.e. a detection significance of @xmath60 for 1 interesting parameter ) .",
    "these were e1821@xmath46143 ( see yamashita _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , pg 1116@xmath46265 ( see nandra _",
    "1996 ) , pks  0637@xmath0752 ( see yaqoob _",
    "_ 1998 ) , and pks 2149@xmath0306 .",
    "the probability of finding four such sources by chance is @xmath61 , or 0.4% . even without the two sources with highly probable bona - fide fe - k lines , the probability is @xmath62 , or 10.9% .",
    "the most likely explanation for the detection of an emission line centered at @xmath3 kev in the rest frame of the radio - loud quasar pks  2149@xmath0306 ( @xmath11 ) is blueshifted fe - k emission ( at a rest - energy in the range 6.46.97 kev ) .",
    "the doppler factor ( ratio of lorentz - boosted energy to rest - energy ) , @xmath63 implies bulk - motion velocities of @xmath64 ( head - on ) . interpreting the emission line in pks  2149@xmath0306",
    "as highly blueshifted fe - k carries with it some strong physical constraints with respect to its origin , in order to account for the large rest - frame equivalent width ( ew ) of ( @xmath65 ev ) .",
    "the main problem is for the line - emitting material to present enough solid angle to the x - ray continuum source to produce sufficient line equivalent width , but not so much that the line becomes too broad .",
    "these conflicting requirements must be overcome by any model .",
    "for example , although a spherical distribution of optically - thick clouds ( e.g. see nandra and george 1994 ) could produce the necessary equivalent width with only a modestly small covering factor of @xmath66 and infall with @xmath67 , the fact that one must integrate over all line - of - sight angles would give a broad line profile stretching from @xmath68 kev in the rest frame .",
    "( infall , as opposed to outflow or a chaotic velocity field gives the largest boost to the equivalent width since the continuum as seen by the fe atoms is maximally lorentz - boosted , as well as the line emission ) .    here",
    "we propose a possible model which overcomes the conflicting solid - angle requirements .",
    "we suppose that an fe - k emission line is produced in an accretion disk , just as thought to be the case for seyfert 1 galaxies and some quasars with redshift lower than that of pks 2149@xmath0306 .",
    "further , the line is assumed to be narrow ( relative to the _ asca _ spectral resolution of @xmath69 ev at fe - k ) , like that observed in the high - luminosity quasar pg 1116@xmath46205 ( i.e. not as broad as the fe - k lines observed in seyfert 1 ) .",
    "then , we invoke a leptonic jet aligned along the disk axis , with the leptons outflowing at @xmath70 .",
    "for the sake of argument , it is assumed that the observer s line of sight is aligned with the jet axis ( it does nt have to be exactly aligned ) .",
    "if the jet is very long compared to the disk radius then the requirement of a small solid angle is satisfied , ( resulting in a line - profile which is not too broad , especially in view of the tightly constrained velocity field of the jet ) , and yet can potentially intercept most of the fe - k line photons from the disk which escape parallel to the disk and jet axis .",
    "the disk photons will be compton - scattered by the leptons in the jet and will be highly collimated along the jet axis since the line photons leaving the disk and intercepting the jet are strongly aligned along the disk / jet axis and the doppler boosting by the jet favours forward scattering , the larger the lorentz factor .",
    "this again ensures that the line does not become too broad .",
    "now , both line and continuum photons will experience the same doppler effects so the only factor contributing to an increase in the equivalent width ( ew ) of the line is the fact that the latter is defined as ratio of line to continuum _ per unit energy _ so the intrinsic ew ( @xmath71 ) will be increased by a factor @xmath72 $ ] where @xmath73 is",
    "the fraction of the disk area blocked by the jet and @xmath74 is the jet thomson optical depth .",
    "actually the optical depth will vary at different points along the jet so @xmath74 represents the value averaged over all the interactions of the disk line - photons with the jet . in principle",
    ", @xmath75 could be as large @xmath76 ev ( as observed in seyfert galaxies ) . this would imply @xmath77 ; on the other hand if @xmath75 is a few tens of ev ( say , 50 ev ) , @xmath78 .",
    "multiple scattering is not a problem because the velocity field is so narrow that multiply - scattered photons will appear as narrow ( weaker ) features at higher energies .",
    "such a fine - tuning of @xmath74 also may explain why the phenomenon is not commonly observed in other quasars .",
    "this model also predicts that nothing unusual would be observed in the optical emission - line spectrum ( and indeed this is the case , e.g. wilkes 1986 ) if the blr is situated much further from the central x - ray source than the disk - jet system .",

    "we also thank an anonymous referee for helping to improve the paper .",
