    "@xcite    the numerical efficiency of the dmrg for 1d quantum and 2d classical systems is due in part to its variational background ,  @xcite in which the trial state is constructed as a product of orthogonal matrices that represent the block - spin ( or the renormalization group ) transformations .",
