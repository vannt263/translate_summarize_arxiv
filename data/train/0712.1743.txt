    "self - gravitating clouds are an essential constituent of the in - homogeneous interstellar medium .",
    "they are either regions of ongoing or , if the clouds become cold enough to be gravitational unstable , future star - formation .",
    "they are important for the chemistry in the ism through the formation of molecules , in particular molecular hydrogen , and they play probably an essential role for the life - cycle of interstellar dust grains since in dense environments grains are thought to grow to larger sizes through a variety of physical processes .",
    "those grain processes not only alter the mean optical grain properties and therefore the extinction curve , most importantly at ultraviolet and far - ultraviolet wavelengths , but will probably also lead to a different integrated grain surface area . because molecules form on dust grains and their formation rate is controlled by the strength of the photo dissociation flux inside the cloud these grain processes will have direct consequences for the formation of molecules .",
    "our knowledge of the dust properties in clouds is furthermore crucial for our understanding of the origin of the interstellar extinction curve as parts of the dense material will be redistributed into the diffuse ism .",
    "this will enrich the gas with large grains with a composition possibly rather different to grains initially formed around cold stars , in planetary nebulae , or in the metal rich part of the ejected material of supernova explosions .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of self - gravitating clouds might have an important contribution to the global sed of galaxies , in particular at far infrared and submm wavelength , thanks to the large population of cool dust which they are expected to contain .",
    "the origin of self - gravitating clouds is likely related to turbulent motion .",
    "a turbulent medium would not only naturally produce a distribution of cloud masses as observed for the ism @xcite but is also possibly directly linked to the initial mass function of the stars @xcite .",
    "an isothermal turbulent medium leads to a multi - fractal structure where large clouds actually consist of distributions of clouds of different sizes .",
    "as shown by simulations @xcite and verified analytically @xcite , the probability distribution of the local density in an isothermal turbulent medium can be well described by a simple log - normal density distribution . in the presence of gravity this distribution is squeezed by increasing the number of higher densities while the number of low density values decreases @xcite .",
    "this happens as clouds become more compact due to gravitational pressure .",
    "if the gravitational forces are strong enough to hold the cloud together against the turbulent motions the density enhancements become stable .",
    "if the gravitational pressure surpasses the maximum thermal and , possibly , magnetic pressure support , then they will collapse and will form stars .    here , we consider stable , isothermal , self - gravitating clouds assumed to be in pressure equilibrium with their surrounding medium . to be able to infer the dust properties from observations of the re - emitted and the scattered light and to minimise any complications by radiative transfer effects we shall limit our attention to simple , idealistically spherical , cloud structures .",
    "we find them in small molecular clouds , the so called bok globules @xcite , and , to somewhat less extend , in translucent clouds , so named as they have attenuation in the range @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we further will consider only those isolated clouds which are illuminated by the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) which is , as first approximation , assumed to be isotropic .",
    "clouds often show a rather elongated structure which might be idealized through self - gravitating infinite cylinders .",
    "the sed of those clouds is analyzed in a following paper ( paper ii in this series ) .",
    "translucent clouds are the interface between the diffuse and the dense molecular phase of the cold neutral medium .",
    "although the clouds are optically thick they are still transparent enough to allow optical and uv absorption line measurements which enable us to analyse the different processes in dense gas in more detail . measurements of the extinction curve for example @xcite give us essential information about the grain properties in clouds important to infer the conditions and the processes responsible for grain growth .",
    "bok globules are highly optically thick at their centres and appear as dark clouds in front of the distant stars and nebula .",
    "these clouds are through their simple , almost spherically shape ideal objects to study the formation of low massive stars and the molecular phase of the ism . that those clouds are indeed regions of star formation as suggested by @xcite has been revealed by an iras survey that showed that @xmath1 of bok globules are associated with a young stellar object with a mass of at least @xmath2 , the detection limit of the survey , in the cloud centre @xcite .    the scattered light from almost spherical globules which are illuminated by an idealised isotropic radiation field has been used not only to infer the properties of the grains as the typical size , the dust albedo and the asymmetry of the scattered light but also to derive the density profile at the rim of the cloud @xcite .",
    "molecular line observations show that bok globules have in general a rather steep density profile at the outskirts approximately described by a power law @xmath3 @xcite . in the centre of stable clouds",
    "the profile becomes rather flat @xcite .",
    "qualitatively the density profile of translucent clouds is similar but less steep at the outskirts .",
    "the questions we seek to address in this paper are    what is the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of stable self - gravitating clouds and how is the scattered light and the thermal re - emission affected by the density structure of these clouds .",
    "although there are several indications that the grain properties in dense clouds are different than in the diffuse interstellar medium we will base our calculations on the mean properties derived for the milky way .",
    "we will address the effect of different grain properties in the discussion .",
    "calculations of the spectral energy distribution from isothermal self - gravitating clouds were presented by @xcite and @xcite but they used a different approach to model the dust emission .",
    "we will discuss their models in more detail in the discussion .",
    "our work may be best compared with the one presented by @xcite .",
    "the model assumptions , however , are different in several respects .",
    "in particular it was not their intention to model the scattered light as it is here .",
    "further , the calculation in this paper is based on a physical , although simple , cloud model while the results by bernard et al .",
    "were based on a simplified density structure with a flat density profile in the cloud centre and a power law profile at the outer cloud region @xmath4 with @xmath5 chosen to be 0 , 1 , and 2 . for a fixed density at the cloud boundary",
    "their seds were derived for several values of the central density , the power @xmath5 , and the total extinction @xmath6 through the cloud centre . in our model of stable clouds",
    "the seds are determined by only two parameters , the pressure outside of the cloud and the critical mass fraction of the cloud mass relative to the critical mass where the cloud becomes gravitational unstable against gravitational collapse .",
    "the calculations of bernard et al . and",
    "ours are based on the mean properties of the dust grains in the ism .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : in section 2 we will discuss the physical properties of the isothermal clouds model . in section 3 we describe the dust model used in all calculations and in section 4 the radiative transfer program . in section 5",
    "we will adopt this model to derive the sed and brightness profiles for a number of different parameters .",
    "we show the effect of the compactness of the clouds on the emission of pah molecules and the dust emission .",
    "the results are discussed in section 6 .",
    "a summary of our results is given in section 7 .",
    "to model the sed of self - gravitating clouds we consider the clouds to be isothermal and to be in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium .",
    "particular interest is given for clouds embedded by the wnm of our galaxy .",
    "the pressure of this medium , which includes the thermal and magnetic pressure , is taken to be @xmath7 based on the work from @xcite .",
    "following @xcite the pressure due to cosmic rays is neglected as they will pervade both the cloud and the ambient medium . for simplicity",
    "the isothermal clouds are taken to be spherical .",
    "in addition we neglected the observed complex substructure likely related to turbulent motion inside the clouds .",
    "the clouds have a radial density profile which is determined by the equilibrium of the isothermal and gravitational pressure which is obtained by solving the lane - emden - equation .",
    "the mathematics structure of such clouds is developed in the appendix to this paper .",
    "we point out that our approach stays valid in the case where the turbulent motion and magnetic pressure inside the cloud can be approximated by an increase of the thermal motion .",
    "the problem of isothermal clouds plays an important role in astrophysics as it gives insights in the inner structure of stars and about the star formation and had therefore been studied in the past @xcite .",
    "isothermal spheres have furthermore been used to analyse extinction measurements @xcite or to model the observed infrared emission of dense clouds @xcite often referred to as pre - stellar cores . in general a very good agreement has been found . in the following",
    "we will describe some properties that are important for the solution of the radiative transfer problem .",

    "clouds with a high critical mass fraction of 0.5 have an optical thickness towards the cloud centre of only @xmath123 in v. therefore , the total heating rate in the centre of those clouds is less than a factor of 2 lower than in the outskirts .    the heating is predominantly caused by the attenuated external light . for clouds with small critical mass fraction",
    "the scattered light does not make a strong contribution and the heating by thermal emission from grains is negligible . the contribution of the scattered light to the total heating increases with critical mass fraction . in the central regions of clouds close to the gravitational collapse",
    "the scattered light is almost as important as the attenuated flux .",
    "clouds in the high pressure region are 7 times more optically thick . as a result",
    "the total heating decreases by more than a factor of 10 towards the cloud centre .",
    "interestingly we found that the scattered light never dominates the heating of the attenuated flux .",
    "the heating by the thermal dust emission is significantly higher but still below the other contributions .",
    "while the heating by thermal re - emission is still unimportant in the centre of clouds with @xmath124 the contribution increases up to @xmath125 in case of critical stable clouds .    the contribution of the thermal emission depends somewhat on the strength of the external radiation field .",
    "if the radiation field is more intense the grains will be warmer , which shifts the radiation of the dust re - emission to shorter wavelengths . because the absorption efficiency of most grains increases towards shorter wavelengths it therefore becomes more likely that emitted photons are once again absorbed by other dust grains .",

    "if the grains are heated by the isrf the temperature decreases rapidly towards larger sizes , shows a minimum at @xmath129 and increases slightly to even larger sizes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the temperature of large iron grains is not necessarily higher than grains of other materials but similar sizes .",
    "the decrease in grain temperature towards the cloud centre reflects firstly the decrease of grain heating .",
    "but we also see in fig .",
    "[ figgraintemp ] that the temperatures of small grains decrease more rapidly than the larger grains .",
    "the strongest radial variation of temperature is seen for the small iron grains .",
    "this effect is caused by the fact that the absorption behaviour decreases for wavelengths typically larger than the grain size ( or for wavelengths @xmath130 ) .",
    "small grains are efficiently heated by uv radiation . due to the high extinction at those wavelengths the uv - radiation is strongly reduced which leads to a strong decrease of the grain heating of small grains .",
    "large grains are less effected as they are also strongly heated by the optical light .    in case of high optical depths both the uv - radiation and the optical radiation",
    "is strongly absorbed at the outskirts of the clouds , so the grains in the central region become predominantly heated by infrared photons .",
    "as the wavelengths dependence of the absorption coefficients at those wavelengths are similar for all grains ( the absorption coefficient decreases for wavelengths larger than the grain size proportional to @xmath131 ) the grain temperatures become equal .",
    "however , in all cases the small iron grains show significantly higher temperatures .",

    "our calculations assume the same probabilities of ionised and non ionised molecules taken to be the value for the cnm .",
    "therefore , the model could be improved by adding an explicit solution of the pah charge state , and this would then enable the pah spectrum to be used as a probe of the uv field within the dark cloud .",
    "the model presented here can be compared with the work of @xcite and of @xcite who were modeling the emission in the fir and submm - regime of highly dense clouds to obtain better estimates for the dust mass . as in our model , the calculations were ( at least partly ) based upon an isothermal self - gravitating sphere .",
    "however , they applied the model also to unstable clouds which show higher overpressures and can be more optically thick relative to the critical stable clouds .",
    "one of the main differences to our calculations , apart from the fact that @xcite did not consider the complication through scattered light , lies in the method used to derive the thermal emission from dust grains .    in their models , the dust emission at different depths inside the cloud",
    "is obtained assuming that the dust emission can be described by an effective grain temperature where the cooling rate is equal to the heating rate , both derived using the mean optical dust properties .",
    "although this assumption fullfills the energy conservation , it does not necessarily reflect the actual dust temperatures and , therefore , the correct shape of the dust emission spectrum .",
    "we have seen that this might only be true in the innermost core region of highly optical thick clouds .",
    "otherwise the simplification will underestimate the dust emission at short wavelengths where it is dominated by the emission from small particles as they cool in general less efficiently and might show strong temperature fluctuations . in the fir or submm - regime a physical model of the grain temperatures might be less important as the emission is dominated by large grains .",
    "however , this aspect should be analyzed more quantitatively to improve the mass estimate for highly compact and dense clouds .",

    "it is possible that these overshadow the uncertainties which arise by using a rather simplified dust model . in both works mentioned above",
    ", the calculations are based on the mean dust opacities provided by @xcite ( oh - model ) , which were derived on theoretical considerations of grain growth in a dense medium and may , therefore , be more appropriate for the dust properties in dense compact clouds .",
    "as the data are given only for wavelengths larger then @xmath190 , extrapolations to the optical and uv light were made , independent on the actual grain properties assumed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite combined the oh - model with the model of @xcite ( mrn - model ) which was originally obtained by fitting the mean extinction curve of the interstellar medium .",
    "the mrn - model predicts an overabundance of small dust particles to explain the rise in the uv and the optical while , as discussed in the previous section , a flat extinction curve is expected .",
    "although it is not mentioned , a flatter curve was probably assumed in the work of @xcite as indicated by the lower effective dust temperature at the outskirts of the clouds ( 14 k instead of 17 k as stated by @xcite ) . for comparison , in our model the equilibrium grain temperatures ( shown in fig .",
    "[ figgraintemp ] ) vary between different sizes and compositions .",
    "if we consider only the silicate and graphite particles the temperatures at the edge of highly optical thick clouds range from 12 to @xmath191 .",
    "the absorption properties in the optical determine not only the effective temperature in the outskirts of the highly optically thick clouds but also how deep the optical emission can penetrate inside the cloud .",
    "the stronger temperature gradient in case of @xcite should produce a steeper brightness profile at fir and submm - wavelengths if compared with @xcite .",
    "it is true that in highly dense clouds most of the optical emission is absorbed at the cloud outskirts so that the dust in the core region is predominantly heated by ir photons .",
    "however , most power of the diffuse isrf lies , even if we take the dirbe measurements of the ir emission over the entire sky into account which has been neglected in our calculations but has been considered in the two other works , in the optical . as consequence , the emission from the outskirts should affect to a certain degree not only the spectral shape but also , as has been discussed in the previous section , the position of the emission peak . on the other hand",
    ", it is indeed expected that the dependence of the sed beyond the emission peak on the optical absorption is less strong and weakens towards more optically thick clouds .    to study the dependence of the optical properties on the dust emission spectrum",
    ", @xcite considered different scattering properties of the dust grains .",
    "the authors found only a weak dependence of 10 to 20% .",
    "the conclusion would be in agreement with our calculations if we had based them also on an effective dust temperature : as we have seen in sect .",
    "[ sectheating ] the dust scattered light makes only a minor contribution to the dust heating at the cloud outskirts .",
    "where it is important the heating by scattered light is less than @xmath192 of the total heating rate . as the effective temperature depends only as @xmath193 on the heating rate @xmath194 the effective temperature would not vary by more than a factor @xmath195 if we would have ignored the scattered light completely .",
    "because in the rayleigh - jeans part the emission spectrum is proportional to the grain temperature , only a weak temperature dependence beyond the emission peak would arize .",
    "the shape of the cloud will have certainly an efffect on the radiative transfer problem .",
    "as mentioned , a following paper will focus on the sed from cylindrical cloud structures where this aspect will , at least to a certain degree , be considered .",
    "apart from the actual overall shape , the sed of interstellar clouds will be affected by the in - homogeneous substructure caused by non - thermal motion which is probably related to magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence inside the cloud @xcite .",
    "the turbulent motion will provide an additional pressure support term , so such clouds might be more stable against gravitational collapse . as discussed for the ism the turbulent motion will create a broad density distribution of the local density which is approximately described by a simple log - normal function .    the effect of the turbulent substructure might be considered by using an idealistic structure of a turbulent medium superimposed on the simple radial structure discussed here . the turbulent motion might even lead to a broadening so that the radial density profile of turbulent clouds might be less steep .",
    "the maximum structure is related to the cloud size and the width of the density distribution of the local density to the strength of the turbulence .",
    "because of the fractal structure of high density clouds the light will penetrate to deeper cloud regions so that grains in those regions become warmer than in clouds without turbulence .",
    "in addition turbulence produces density enhancements which are optically thick where grains show colder temperature",
    ". it will be important to determine how large these effects actually are .",
    "our model still does not explain all the observational properties , particularly those of dense clouds .",
    "in the case of bok globules or also in the case of dense cores in molecular clouds it has been found that the non - thermal contribution to the line width increases for more optically thick lines indicating an increase of the turbulent motion from the cloud centre outwards @xcite .",
    "this observation is generally explained by the strong dissipation of magnetic motion in high density gas .",
    "this leads to a core - envelope structure of the cloud where the core region is mainly supported by thermal pressure while the envelope is supported mainly by magnetic and turbulent pressure .",
    "based on this observation @xcite suggested a model where the the core and the envelope are described by two different polytropes where the in the two regions the pressure is related to the density via @xmath196 with different values for @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the polytrope index .",
    "this model is able to produce the high density contrast observed for a number of clouds which is larger than the maximum value of 14.04 of the bonner - ebert sphere .",
    "@xcite discussed a model for molecular clouds using multipressure polytropes where the different pressure components in the cloud , thermal , turbulent , and magnetic pressure , are described by different polytropes .",
    "it produces arbitrarily large density contrasts for stable clouds .    on the other hand , it has been shown based on extinction measurements in the nir that the profiles of the projected column density of rather spherical globules are well described by the density structure of the isothermal sphere @xcite . the small sample of 10 globules studied by kandori et al .",
    "indicate that most of the globules are at the critical state to gravitational collapse .",
    "the derived external pressure , however , shows strong variation from @xmath199 up to @xmath200 with a mean of @xmath201 which is almost 3 times larger than the value assumed here which should be typical for the ism of our galaxy . it might well be that in certain cases the simplification using an isothermal cloud model has to be compensated by a higher external pressure .",
    "following kandori et al .",
    "the model of an isothermal sphere is also able to mimic in the limit of the observational uncertainties the density profiles of clouds which undergo the gravitational collapse .",
    "we have analysed in some detail the sed from spherical , self gravitating , isothermal stable clouds illuminated by an isotropic isrf .",
    "the radiative transfer through those clouds is , for given radiation field and dust properties inside the cloud , determined by the pressure of the ambient medium and by the critical mass fraction @xmath11 of the cloud mass @xmath12 and the critical mass @xmath202 where the cloud becomes gravitational unstable .",
    "the dust properties in the clouds are assumed to be consistent with the ones in the diffuse ism of our galaxy .",
    "we derived the sed for different assumptions of the critical mass fraction @xmath13 , outer pressure @xmath21 and strength of the external isrf .",
    "our special attention was the sed from clouds embedded in the wnm with a pressure of @xmath28 which were compared with seds from clouds in higher pressure regions .",
    "we find that :    * the grain temperatures in stable isothermal clouds embedded in the wnm are generally higher than 10  k. lower temperatures are expected for collapsing clouds or for clouds in higher pressure regions .",
    "* the ratio of the dust emission relative to the pah - emission rises towards higher critical mass fraction and outer pressure . * as clouds are generally more optically thick in higher pressure regions more light is transferred to thermal emission .",
    "we further analysed the brightness profiles of the scattered emission at 440 and at 900  nm and the thermal emission from dust grains and pah - molecules in the ir / fir and in the submm / mm regime .",
    "we find that :    * for stable isothermal clouds embedded in the wnm the scattered emission at 440  nm developes for increasing mass fraction a broad wing - like profile as seen for bok - globules in our galaxy . at longer wavelength",
    "the scattered emission is brighter towards the cloud centre . in high pressure regions the scattered emission is more concentred to the limb of the clouds . * for stable isothermal clouds in the wnm",
    "the pah brightness profile shows a weak wing - like profile if the clouds are critical to collapse . in high density regions",
    "the profile shows a strong limb - brightening effect . * the brightness profiles of the dust emission is generally broader in respect to the profile of the column density .",
    "the effect increases towards shorter wavelengths and is more prominent in high pressure regions .",
