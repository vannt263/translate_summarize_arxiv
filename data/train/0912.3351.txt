    "an isolated stochastic population ( of molecules , bacteria , animals , parasites inhabiting a community of hosts , _",
    "etc_. ) ultimately goes extinct .",
    "the ultimate extinction is driven , even in the absence of unfavorable environmental variations , by large demographic fluctuations : chains of random events when population losses dominate over gains .",
    "the risk of population extinction is a major issue in viability of small populations in the nature @xcite , whereas extinction of an endemic disease from a community @xcite is a desirable development .",
    "calculating the extinction rate of a stochastic population is a challenging problem .",
    "here one needs to evaluate the ( very low ) probability of a large fluctuation in a stochastic system which is far from equilibrium and therefore defies many standard assumptions and methods of statistical mechanics . in spite of this difficulty",
    "a significant progress has been achieved in this type of problems via the use of a wkb ( wentzel - kramers - brillouin ) approximation borrowed from quantum mechanics ( or , more generally , wave mechanics ) and adapted to the dissipative , non - hermitian stochastic markov processes @xcite .",
    "the wkb approximation employs , as a large parameter , the typical population size in the metastable quasi - stationary state . for a broad class of single - population stochastic systems",
    "this approximation , complemented by additional perturbation techniques , yields accurate and controlled analytical results for the population extinction rate @xcite .",
    "stochastic systems involving multiple populations present a much harder problem .",
    "here one arrives , already in the leading order of the wkb approximation , at a generally non - integrable multi - dimensional problem of classical mechanics .",
    "although the extinction rates and most probable paths of the system to extinction can be found numerically , analytical insight is usually limited .",
    "the situation improves , however , if the multi - population system exhibits time - scale separation .",
    "this may happen in two cases : ( i ) when the multi - population system is close to a bifurcation of the underlying deterministic rate equations @xcite , and ( ii ) when there is a wide difference in individual process rates .",
    "the present paper deals with the second case .",
    "the process rate disparity introduces an additional small parameter @xmath2 which enables one to separate , with controlled accuracy , a two - population system into a fast and slow subsystems .",
    "each of these subsystems is one - dimensional and therefore amenable to analytical solution .",
    "time scale separation was recently employed in ref .",
    "@xcite for calculating the extinction rate of a biologically important component regulated by chemical reactions in a living cell . in that class of systems",
    "the extinction probability flux sets in on the slow time scale , whereas the fast subsystem ( which rapidly adjusts to the slowly varying distribution of the slow subsystem ) modifies the effective production rate of the population on the way to extinction . in the present work we consider a different class of systems which enables us to generalize the standard notion of the quasi - stationary extinction rate by defining and calculating a _ time - resolved _ quasi - stationary extinction rate .",
    "it turns out that this quantity smoothly changes in time from a short - time asymptote @xmath0 to a long - time asymptote @xmath1 .",
    "the short - time quasi - stationary extinction rate @xmath0 sets in already on the fast time scale .",
    "notably , @xmath0 coincides with the extinction rate in the case when the slow processes are absent altogether .",
    "then , as the probability distribution evolves towards the long - time quasi - stationary distribution , the extinction rate undergoes a smooth but exponentially large change and approaches @xmath1 .",
    "this evolution occurs on the time scale of the slow subsystem ( which is much longer than the time scale of the fast subsystem but much shorter than the mean time to extinction @xmath3 ) .",
    "the exponentially large disparity of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is an instance of the recently discovered extinction rate fragility @xcite , where @xmath4 experiences a discontinuity when the rates of the slow processes are taken to zero .",
    "essentially , the present work renders an alternative , time - resolved , description to the phenomenon of extinction rate fragility .",

    "the present work suggests an alternative picture of the extinction rate fragility : in the time domain instead of the @xmath214-domain where it was originally established .",
    "our main results can be expressed in the following way .",
    "we started out by presenting the probability distribution @xmath215 in a factorized form : @xmath216 , where @xmath85 is the probability to have the total population size @xmath103 , when at least one individual is infected , and @xmath86 is the probability to have @xmath217 infected individuals , when the total population size is @xmath103 . at @xmath218 and @xmath219 the @xmath86-distribution is independent of time to the zero order in @xmath192 ; the population turnover only affects @xmath85 . as a result ,",
    "the time - dependent extinction rate @xmath53 is determined by the extinction rate for the total population size @xmath103 , obtained for @xmath220 and averaged over the slow - time - dependent @xmath85-distribution . the short - time quasi - stationary extinction rate @xmath0 corresponds to the initial probability distribution of the total population size @xmath103 , whereas the long - time quasi - stationary extinction rate @xmath1 corresponds to the steady - state @xmath103-distribution . under less restrictive conditions @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath17 our theory accurately predicts the logarithm of the time - dependent extinction rate @xmath197 .",
    "we have shown that the time - resolved quasi - stationary extinction rate encodes a more detailed information about the stochastic dynamics than the average quantities such as the mean time to extinction .",
    "the latter quantity is determined by the late - time asymptote @xmath1 of the time - resolved extinction rate .",
    "our analytical approach can be used in a host of two - population models which exhibit a long - lived quasi - stationary state on the way to extinction , and where a disparity between the process rates enables one to separate the system into two one - dimensional sub - systems : the fast and the slow .",
    "one can envision two different scenarios in such systems . in one scenario",
    ", extinction takes place only in the slow subsystem , whereas the fast subsystem merely modifies the effective process rates , as in ref . @xcite . in another scenario",
    "the problem is reducible ( as in the sis model with a slow population turnover which we have considered here ) to averaging the instantaneous extinction rate , generated by the fast subsystem , over the time - dependent distribution of the slow subsystem . for a sufficiently large population size , the instantaneous extinction rate , generated by the fast subsystem , can be accurately calculated via wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "how can one find the time - dependent population size distribution of the slow sub - system ?",
    "for the sis model the one - dimensional master equation ( [ n106 ] ) for the slow population turnover is decoupled from the fast sub - system , and even exactly solvable . in general",
    "one can not hope for such a dramatic simplification , and the fast subsystem will modify the effective process rates of the slow subsystem , as in ref .",
    "it is important , however , that this effect can be described by a time - dependent wkb theory , once the corresponding large parameter is present .",
