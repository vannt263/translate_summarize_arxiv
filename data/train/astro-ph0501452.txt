    "using a sample of 44 abell clusters @xcite showed that clusters of galaxies are highly eccentric . @xcite",
    "measured the x - ray contours of 49 abell clusters and found that most clusters are clearly flattened . by means of n - body simulations",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) demonstrated that dark matter halos have triaxial shapes and tend to be prolate .",
    "furthermore they showed that the prevailing shape is supported by the anisotropic velocity dispersion ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus the shape of the halo mirrors its dynamical state and is likely to be a long - term feature if no major disruptions take place .",
    "subsequently the _ orientation _ of clusters will be identified with the major axis of its mass distribution .",
    "the _ angular momentum _ of galaxy clusters is easily accessible in numerical simulations .",
    "the orientation of the angular momentum may record information about the mass accretion history and/or tidal interactions with the surrounding large scale structure . according to @xcite , @xcite , and",
    "@xcite the primary angular momentum of bound objects is due to tidal interaction between the elongated proto - structures after decoupling from cosmic expansion and before turn - around .",
    "more recent studies find that the angular momentum of dark matter halos is later modified by the merging history of their building blocks , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the _ alignment _ of galaxy cluster orientations is controversial since @xcite published his inaugural study .",
    "he reported that galaxy clusters are oriented relative to neighbours at least for separations smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , he found anisotropies in the cluster distribution on scales up to @xmath12 .",
    "the first investigations , using x - ray contours , led to no @xcite or only weak @xcite significance of alignment effects .",
    "however , @xcite exploring x - ray position angles of 45 clusters found significant alignment of clusters orientations with the connecting line to the next neighbour for separations of @xmath13 .",
    "analysing a large set of optical data of 637 abell clusters @xcite found highly significant alignment effects on scales below @xmath14 that become weaker but extend up to @xmath15 .    in the literature two slightly",
    "different scenarios are proposed to explain the alignment of the orientation of clusters .",
    "@xcite suggested that tidal interactions of evolving proto - cluster systems may lead to the growth of anisotropies of clusters and to relative orientation effects .",
    "however , @xcite found that clusters grow by accretion and merging of surrounding matter that falls into the deep cluster potential wells along sheet - like and filamentary high density regions . using numerical cdm simulations @xcite",
    "demonstrate that clusters are elongated along the incoming direction of the last major merger .",
    "further @xcite show that virgo s brightest elliptical galaxies have a remarkably collinear arrangement in three dimensions , which is aligned with the filamentary structure connecting virgo and the rich cluster abell 1367 . in a statistical investigation of 303 abell clusters @xcite confirm the alignments of galaxy members with their parent cluster orientation as well as with the large - scale environment within which the clusters are embedded .",
    "therefore , the cluster formation is tightly connected with the super - cluster network that characterises the large - scale matter distribution in the universe .",
    "high - resolution simulations showing this effect were described by the virgo collaboration , @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a significant alignment signal up to scales of @xmath16 for a @xmath0cdm model . @xcite and @xcite using large scale dissipationless n - body simulations of the @xmath0cdm universe report alignment of the orientations of galaxy clusters for separations @xmath17 . improved statistics due to a much larger simulation volume enable @xcite to find correlations ranging up to @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite using the same simulation than we do , but an eight times increased mass resolution , found alignment between cluster sized halos and their hosting super - clusters .",
    "this work aims to link the vector quantities of galaxy clusters ( orientation and angular momentum ) with their recent mass accretion history .",
    "the basic cluster sample comprises the 3000 most massive cdm halos found by a friends - of - friends ( fof ) approach .",
    "further the basic sample is divided into two sub - samples , namely a _ recent major merger _",
    "sample and a _ steady accretion mode _ sample .",
    "the subdivision criterion is based on the mass fraction of the two most massive progenitors at @xmath3 .",
    "the masses and positions of these progenitors hold information about the pattern of infall onto the cluster .",
    "we find a strong correlations between the infall pattern and the cluster vector quantities . finally , since the infall happens along the large scale filaments we analyse long range correlations of these vector quantities between cluster pairs by means of mark correlation functions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . ",
    "[ sec : sample ] describes the simulation and explains the construction of cluster sample and sub - samples . in  [ sec : impact ] the impact of different mass accretion modes ( merger / steady accretion ) on shape and angular momentum of the clusters is investigated . in ",
    "[ sec : mark ] the range of the alignment of the major , the minor , and the angular momentum axes of cluster pairs is measured . ",
    "[ sec : sum ] summaries the results .",
    "in subsection  [ sec : sim ] some information about the simulation is provided and  [ sec : basicsample ] describes the construction of the basic cluster sample . in the last paragraph (  [ sec : accretion ] ) the subdivision of the basic cluster sample into a merger and a steady accretion mode sample is explained .",
    "the simulation is performed using the public available gadget code ( see @xcite ) . according to the presently favoured cosmological model , we assume a flat universe with the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 and a hubble constant of @xmath21 .",
    "the linear power spectrum of the density fluctuations has been normalised to @xmath22 .",
    "the simulation is realized within a cube of @xmath2 edge length .",
    "the cold dark matter and the gaseous component are represented by @xmath23 particles each .",
    "the mean baryonic mass fraction of the universe is assumed to be @xmath24 , consequently the mass of a single cdm particle is @xmath25 and the mass of a single gas particle is @xmath26 .",
    "the gas is simulated using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) with no baryonic cooling or heating processes taken into account .      for the identification of cluster halos",
    "we apply a standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the cdm and the gaseous particle distributions are treated separately . the basic cluster is based on the 3000 most massive cdm halos found with a linking length of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the mean particle distance ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most massive cluster in the basic sample comprises 4201 particles which corresponds to a cdm mass of @xmath29 .",
    "the smallest object in the sample has a cdm mass of @xmath30 containing 209 particles .",
    "subsequently the gaseous halos , identified by an analogous fof approach ( @xmath27 ) applied to the gas particle distribution , are associated with their cdm clusters .",
    "we apply a linking length of @xmath27 also for redshifts @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) show that the formation rate of galaxy clusters in the @xmath0cdm universe peaks at @xmath32 . in the following we want to subdivide the basic cluster sample according to the accretion history into a _ recent major merger _ sample and a _ steady accretion mode _ sample .",
    "therefore we locate for every cluster the two most massive progenitors at @xmath3 , just a short time interval before the accretion rate is maximal .",
    "these two halos at @xmath3 are identified as being the most massive progenitors , which contain the highest numbers of particles also found in the current ( @xmath1 ) cluster .",
    "the basic cluster sample is subdivided based on the mass fraction of the two most massive cdm progenitors @xmath4 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the most and the second most massive progenitor , respectively .",
    "the 3000 clusters are separated into three disjoint sub - samples , each of them comprising 1000 clusters .",
    "the recent major merger sample contains the clusters with the highest values ( @xmath35 ) for the progenitor mass fractions , meaning that the two progenitors have comparable masses .",
    "the steady accretion mode sample contains the 1000 clusters with the lowest values ( @xmath36 ) for the progenitor mass fractions , meaning that the most massive progenitor is by far more massive than the second most massive progenitor .",
    "consequently all additionally accreted mass must approach within even smaller lumps .",
    "the 1000 clusters with intermediate progenitor mass ratios are omitted from any further investigation , which focuses on the impact of the particular accretion mode .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "( [ fig : d3000.00.00 ] ) shows the distribution of mass fractions ( @xmath37 ) versus @xmath4 with the steady accretion mode clusters appearing on the left and the recent major merger clusters appearing on the right .",

    "the intermediate accretion mode clusters , which are not investigated in the following , are located in the middle of this panel ( grey area ) .",
    "the mean values of the fractions @xmath37 indicated by the horizontal lines in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : d3000.00.00 ] are @xmath39 lower in the merger sample compared to the steady accretion sample , whereas @xmath38 is @xmath40 higher in the merger sample compared to the steady accretion sample .",
    "the difference in the relative decrease of @xmath37 and the increase of @xmath38 indicates a sightly higher additional accretion activity in the merger sample .",
    "the increase of @xmath38 indicates that equal mass mergers tend to result in more massive halos .",
    "but they also show slightly enhanced accretion activity as indicated by the larger relative decrease of the mean values of @xmath37 compared to the relative increase of @xmath38 .",
    "in this section we investigate the impact of the pattern of infall on the principal axes and the angular momentum of current clusters .",
    "we show the regularity of the infall of the two most massive progenitors in the merger sample and demonstrate that an approximate picture of the infall pattern can be derived from the information provided by the current cluster position and the two most massive progenitor positions ( at @xmath3 ) .",
    "subsequently the correlation of these positions with the shape and the angular momentum of current clusters is examined .",
    "the following illustration of the infall pattern is based on the recent major merger sample ( see   [ sec : accretion ] ) .",
    "the vectors , which will be later correlated with the shape and the angular momentum of the emerged cluster , are combinations of the position vectors of the two most massive progenitors @xmath41 and @xmath42 at @xmath3 and of the cluster s position @xmath43 at @xmath1 .",
    "the 2000 progenitors span a mass range of @xmath44 which corresponds to a range in particle numbers of @xmath45 .",
    "subsequently we focus on the difference vector @xmath46 and the cross product of the velocities @xmath47 as defined in the following equations .",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath46 is the difference vector of the locations of the two most massive progenitors .",
    "the directions of the mean velocities @xmath51 and @xmath52 are calculated by subtracting the position of the current cluster by the corresponding positions of the progenitors at @xmath3 .",
    "thus @xmath47 is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the merging progenitors . in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] @xmath46 and @xmath47 are sketched along with a schematized merging event .",
    "we only examine the tracks within the recent major merger sample to justify the description of the infall pattern by @xmath46 and @xmath47 . tracking the halos through 33 intermediate snapshots in the steady accretion mode",
    "is unfeasible due to the involvement of low mass ( or sparse number of particle ) halos .",
    "[ fig : example ] aims to explain the projection and the adjustment procedures which need to be applied before all the tracks can be stacked up .",
    "starting at @xmath3 we trace the 2000 most massive progenitors through 33 simulation outputs between @xmath3 and @xmath1 . by definition",
    "all of these tracks have to merge at some point with another track .",
    "the descendant of an actual halo in the subsequent snapshot is in the first instance associated with the halo that contains the most overlapping particles . at the same time we check whether the masses of the descendant and the actual halo are in agreement . for strong deviations ( factor of @xmath53 )",
    "we choose , if present , an alternate descendant showing slightly fewer overlapping particles but better mass agreement .",
    "[ fig : example ] shows the projection of two different merging events onto the _ merging plane _",
    "perpendicular to @xmath47 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : vx ] ) . here",
    "two different representations of the same merging event are depicted in a row .",
    "each dot represents the location of the particular halo at a given snapshot .",
    "the coordinate systems in the right panels are rotated in such a way that the positions of the two progenitors are located on the y - axis ( @xmath54 ) with equal separation from the origin .",
    "the y - coordinate of the most massive progenitor is displayed at positive y - values , consecutively the second massive progenitor has negative y - values . in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] ) the image is stretched in such a manner , that the initial coordinates of the progenitors remain unchanged but the final cluster position is projected to the x - axis ( i.e. the dashed line in the left panels coincides with the x - axis in the right panels ) .",
    "finally the merger point is shifted to the origin .",
    "this adjustments neither change the direction of @xmath46 nor the direction of @xmath47 . after applying these adjustments to all the members of the merging sample the resulting tracks are stacked up . fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] presents face and edge on sight of all the merging events .    as the tracks of particular merging events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] ) show the two progenitors approach each other until they merge in a jump - like manner .",
    "this behaviour is due to the application of the fof algorithm for the identification of the halos .",
    "the jumps of @xmath55 to the merger point reflect roughly the radii of the progenitor halos .",
    "the separation vector connecting the last distinguishable positions of the progenitors is in both cases ( upper and lower panels ) remarkable aligned with @xmath46 .",
    "this feature can also be seen in the stacked up plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) .",
    "the two branches depicting the incoming progenitor halos show enhanced densities slightly left of @xmath54 .",
    "the line joining this two areas is parallel to the y - axis .",
    "thus the @xmath46 gives a good approximation of the main infall direction .",
    "as order of magnitude estimates show the mutual gravitational attraction of two clusters in the considered mass and distance range dominates over the impact of large scale gravitational field .",
    "therefore , the two halos are expected to approach each other in a fairly radial way , along the line joining them .",
    "the tendency of the encounters to be parabolic can be inferred from the average shape of the infall pattern . the flatness of the distribution of tracks in the edge on representation ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : all ] ) indicates that @xmath47 describes the orbital plane in a rather satisfactory manner .",
    "these outcomes confirm that despite the apparent simplifications the vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 are capable of determining the direction of infall and the orbital plane , respectively .      in this paragraph",
    "we investigate the correlations between vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 and the shapes of the current clusters .",
    "the shape of a cluster is determined by the eigenvectors of the second moment of mass tensor @xmath56 as given by the following equation .",
    "@xmath57 here @xmath58 specifies the particle masses .",
    "the position vector @xmath59 of the @xmath60 cdm particles belonging to the halo is given in respect of the centre of mass and the components of the vector belonging to the @xmath61th particle are denoted @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "here we show only the results based on the dark matter component , but the behaviour of the gaseous component is very similar .",
    "subsequently the three eigenvectors of @xmath56 are denoted @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are ordered by magnitude ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "hence @xmath64 indicates the major , @xmath65 the intermediate and @xmath66 the minor axis .",
    "since cluster halos show preferentially prolate shape ( see e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath64 is identified with the orientation of the cluster .",
    "the distributions of the angles between the principal axes and @xmath46 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rd_axes3000 ] .",
    "the diagonal represents the cumulative distribution of the _ cosine _ of the angles between two randomly orientated vectors .",
    "a curve lying below the diagonal indicates an correlation between vectors , i.e. the vectors have a tendency to be parallel more often than a random sample .",
    "a curve lying above the diagonal indicates a anti - correlation between the vectors , i.e. the vectors have a tendency to be more often perpendicular than in a random sample .",
    "the thick solid , dashed and dotted lines depict the cumulative distributions of the angles between @xmath46 and the principal axes @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 as indicated .",
    "the left panel shows the results for the recent major merger sample and the right panel those for the steady accretion mode sample .",
    "the dashed lines that represent the angles between the major principal axis @xmath64 and @xmath46 deviate most significantly from a randomly generated distribution ( diagonal ) .",
    "the major axis ( @xmath64 ) tends to be parallel to @xmath46 .",

    ".[tab : kolmogi ] results of a kolmogorov - smirnov test comparing the angle distributions indicated in the first column derived from the recent major merger sample ( second column ) and the steady accretion mode sample with the random distributions as imaged in fig .",

    "the ks probabilities are enhanced for the merger sample , but the qualitative trend is similar in the steady accretion mode sample .",
    "the most obvious differences between the two samples are seen in @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these distributions show opposite behaviour for the merger and the steady accretion mode sample . in the merger sample",
    "the ks probabilities for @xmath74 are very low , indicating that this distribution is obviously incompatible with a random distribution .",

    "the opposite picture arises in the steady accretion mode sample . here",
    "@xmath75 is clearly not in agreement with a random distribution , whereas @xmath74 ca nt be differentiated from random .",
    "we find the effect of steady accretion on the angular momentum is in line with previous work ( i.e.  @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : d3000.00.00 ] , the most massive progenitor in the steady accretion sample is orders of magnitude larger than all other infalling halos .",
    "this explains the result for @xmath75 .",
    "the small tendency of an alignment between @xmath73 and @xmath47 may have the same origin as the finding by @xcite , that merging dark matter satellites show a weak tendency to have velocities perpendicularly orientated to the angular momentum of the main halo .    in the merger sample",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the two most massive progenitors shows a strong impact on the angular momentum of the descendant . a decided difference between @xmath74 and a random distribution",
    "can be seen .",
    "the ks probability of @xmath76 strongly discounts any random process as being the origin of this distribution .",
    "the tendency for @xmath73 and @xmath47 to be parallel confirms the picture that a large fraction of the descendant s angular momentum was gained from the orbital angular momentum of the two most massive progenitors .",
    "this result is in agreement with the detailed study of the angular momenta of dark matter halos by @xcite . whereas the correlation of @xmath77 and @xmath73 is in agreement with random orientations as can be seen by the rather high value of the ks test .",
    "as shown above orientation and angular momentum of current clusters are tightly connected to the infall pattern . the dominant amount of mass is accreted along filaments .",
    "therefore we employ the technique of _ mark correlation functions _ ( see @xcite ) to investigate the difference in the large scale correlations between the basic sample and the two accretion mode sub - samples ( merger / steady ) .",
    "@xcite used the following equation to study _ filamentary _ alignment .",
    "@xmath78 here @xmath79 is a normalised vector quantity ( @xmath80 ) , @xmath59 is the distance vector between a pair of clusters with absolute value @xmath81 .",
    "the normalised distance vector is denoted by @xmath82 and @xmath83 denotes the average over all pairs with separation @xmath81 .",
    "due to the spatial symmetry the absolute values of these scalar products are used .",
    "@xmath84 quantifies the @xmath85ilamentary alignment of the vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 with the line connecting both clusters .",
    "@xmath84 is proportional to the mean value of the _ cosine _ of the angles between @xmath51 and the vector @xmath86 connecting the pairs .",
    "random orientations imply @xmath87",
    ". since the distribution of angles is not of gaussian shape around a given mean value , it would be wrong to apply gaussian statistics to estimate the the errors .",
    "thus , to investigate the 1@xmath88 confidence intervals we perform a non - parametric monte carlo test @xcite . here",
    "the null hypothesis is `` no deviation from random angles '' .",
    "we simulate this null hypotheses by keeping the positions of the halos fixed and randomly re - assigning the orientations to the halos .",
    "this procedure is repeated 99 times .",
    "the rms - deviation for these realisations gives a measure for the 1@xmath88 confidence interval for the given data set .",
    "these intervals are indicated by the shaded areas around the expected values for random distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig : link054.0.170 ] .",
    "thus , if @xmath84 lies outside of this intrinsic scatter region around @xmath89 the deviation from random orientations is confirmed at a 1@xmath88 confidence level .",
    "in addition to the alignment of the cdm component we present the alignment signals for the gaseous halos .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) pointed out that the elongation of halos is reduced due to radiative cooling and subsequent condensation of baryonic matter at the cluster centre .",
    "since we use non radiative sph simulations this effect is not represented . however according to eq .",
    "[ equ : second ] the second moment of mass tensor @xmath56 and thus the orientations of the principal axes are dominated by the mass distribution on the outskirts of the clusters .",

    "we have shown in [ sec : shape ] that the different accretion modes do not result in a qualitatively different impact on the shape of current cluster . however",
    "the correlation between shapes and infall pattern are reduced in the steady accretion mode sample . here",

    "the signal for the merger and the steady accretion mode samples extends up to @xmath94 .",
    "there is no distinctive difference between the results for the two sub - samples .",
    "the somewhat shorter range seen in both sub - samples appears to be a result of the lower statistics ( only 1000 members per sub - sample ) rather than caused by the different accretion modes .",

    "the signal for the minor axis extends up to @xmath93 ( middle left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : link054.0.170 ] ) .",
    "this result is in good agreement with @xcite , where a strong tendency for the minor axes of halos to lie perpendicular to the large scale filaments is found .",
    "the cdm components of the recent major merger sample ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : link054.0.170 ] ) and the steady accretion mode sample show a tendency to be perpendicular to the connecting line for separations up to @xmath96 . here",
    "again the shorter correlation ranges for the sub - samples are likely be caused by the smaller sample size .",
    "the comparison between the signals for the cdm component ( thick solid line ) to the gaseous component ( thin dotted line ) generally show good agreement",
    ". however , the small differences in the correlation range are likely to mirror the different physical properties of the two components . using x - ray position angles @xcite found that clusters with separations @xmath97 tend to point towards their neighbours .",
    "their sample comprised 45 clusters thus the statistics are fairly low compared to our analysis .",
    "previously we have shown that the infall of halos is correlated with the orientation of the cluster and is independent of accretion mode . in this section",
    "we demonstrate that the orientations of clusters are correlated and independent of accretion mode .",
    "since the steady accretion mode sample shows just as much correlation as the merger mode sample all progenitors must be infalling along the same relative direction . from this , we conclude that the alignment is strongly supported by infall along filamentary structure .",
    "the correlation length ( @xmath17 ) for cluster alignment that we find in our simulation is in agreement with the findings of @xcite .      in ",
    "[ sec : angular ] we have analysed the effects of different accretion modes on the angular momentum of current clusters .",
    "we find a different behaviour in the merger and the steady accretion mode samples .",
    "to see , whether these differences have impact on the large scale correlations , we investigate the correlation of the intrinsic angular momenta of cluster pairs in the whole sample , as well as in the two sub - samples .",
    "therefore the angular momenta is used as vector mark in equation ( [ equ : def - vector - corr ] ) .",

    "similar to the result for the correlation of the minor axes ( middle panels fig .",
    "[ fig : link054.0.170 ] ) the angular momenta of the cdm component show the trend to be perpendicular to the connecting lines .",
    "thus they tend to be perpendicular to the filaments as well .",
    "the signal reaches only out to separations of @xmath101 for the complete sample .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with fig .",
    "7b in @xcite .",
    "the cdm signal in the recent major merger sample is hardly distinguishable from random fluctuations .",
    "furthermore the deviation from random is far smaller than seen in the correlations of the principal axes .",
    "as mentioned in the beginning of  [ sec : angular ] , coherent rotation supports the halo against gravitational collapse only at a 5% level , thus a low deviation from random may be expected . however , notable is the long correlation range of the steady accretion mode sample ( @xmath102 ) compared to the almost disappearing signal for the merger sample .",
    "according to the established picture of halos mass growth they go through a merger phase ( rapid mass growth ) prior to a steady accretion phase ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , on average the merger sample is younger than the steady accretion sample .",
    "the results from the above combined with those from the previous section lead to the conclusion that infall along the filaments tends to torque the halo s angular momentum into a perpendicular orientation with respect to those filaments .",
    "@xcite finds a trend that more massive clusters have more associated filaments .",
    "[ fig : d3000.00.00 ] indicates a relative increase of clusters masses in the major merger sample .",
    "moreover , the mass accretion in addition the two most massive progenitors is maximal in the major merger sample .",
    "the rapid accretion in the merger sample takes place along various filaments which causes violent changes in the the angular momentum . in a later state ,",
    "when the smaller filaments are exhausted , the infall direction is more uniform . according to this scenario",
    "it is expected that the merger sample will settle down in time and reflect the same sort of correlations as the current steady accretion sample .",
    "we plan on addressing this issue in a soon to be forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the slightly different behaviour of the gaseous component indicated by the thin dotted lines in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : link054.0.170 ] is likely to be caused by differences in the underlying dynamics .",
    "the gaseous component mainly deviates for cluster pair separations @xmath103 from the dark matter distribution .",
    "we use large scale sph+n - body simulations within the concordance @xmath0cdm model to measure the mass accretion histories and the correlation of orientation and angular momentum of galaxy clusters .",
    "the two most massive progenitors at @xmath3 are located for the 3000 most massive current clusters .",
    "based on the mass fractions of these two progenitors @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) two sub - samples were constructed , a recent major merger sample containing the 1000 clusters with highest @xmath4 values and a steady accretion mode sample with the 1000 lowest @xmath4 values .",
    "the mean values of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the current mass of the particular cluster , for the recent major merger sample and the steady accretion mode sample are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "the clusters which experienced recent major mergers tend to accrete even more matter in addition to @xmath106 than silently evolving clusters .",
    "major mergers predominantly happen to clusters showing averagely enhanced mass accretion .",
    "moreover these clusters tend to have higher masses than their non merging counterparts .",
    "this outcome can be related to the work by @xcite .",
    "they demonstrate that more massive clusters tend to have more filaments approaching them .",
    "consequently their over - all accretion activity may be enhanced .",
    "also @xcite reports strongly enhanced merging activities for the largest members in his sample of n - body clusters .",
    "the reconstruction of the halo tracks in the merger sample reveals that the infall pattern are not complex .",
    "the merging takes place along the vector @xmath46 joining the two most massive progenitor halos at @xmath3 . despite the relatively high additional mass accretion",
    "the tracks of the two most massive progenitors are reasonably well confined within the plane defined by @xmath47 ( eq .  [ eq : vx ] ) .",
    "the tracks do not twine each other , instead the two most massive progenitors approach each other parallel to the line joining them @xmath3 .",
    "this behaviour is expected since the mutual gravitational attraction of two clusters in the considered mass and distance range dominates over the impact of large scale gravitational field .",
    "we find that the orientation and the angular momentum of current clusters are tightly correlated with the vectors @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath46 tends to be parallel to the major axis and perpendicular to the minor axis of the cluster .",
    "the opposite behaviour is found for @xmath47 .",
    "both accretion mode sub - samples show similar correlations .",
    "this indicates that the current orientation is a result of mass flows along the filaments onto the cluster , independent of accretion mode .",
    "it is likely that the accretion flow determines the velocity structure of the cluster .",
    "if this is the case our results agree with alignment of position and velocity principal axes found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the angular momentum behaves differently in the two sub - samples .",
    "the angular momenta @xmath73 of the clusters in the merger sample show the tendency to be parallel to @xmath47 , whereas the orientation of the intrinsic angular momenta of the most massive progenitors @xmath77 at @xmath3 has a minor influence on the angular momentum at @xmath1 .",
    "the opposite picture arises in the steady accretion mode sample . here",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath77 are correlated , whereas the angle distribution between @xmath73 and @xmath47 is in agreement with random orientations .",
    "the major axes of cluster pairs in the basic sample tend to be parallel to their connecting line for distances up to @xmath9 .",
    "correlations up to @xmath107 are found in the steady accretion and the merger sample .",
    "the reduced extension of the correlation is likely caused by the reduced statistic in the sub - samples .",
    "the minor axes of cluster pairs tend to be perpendicular to their connecting line .",
    "the extension of these correlations is similar to the findings for the major axes .",
    "the appearance of large scale correlations of cluster orientations has also been shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mass accretion along the filaments appears to be responsible for the signal , since the accretion mode shows no impact on the correlation signal .",
    "weak correlations are found for the angular momenta in the complete and the steady accretion mode sample .",
    "the angular momenta tend to be orthogonal to the connecting lines of cluster pairs up to @xmath101 for the complete and up to @xmath102 for the steady accretion mode sample .",
    "the orthogonality between angular momentum and filaments is a result of mass accretion along these filaments ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the signal is stronger for the steady accretion sample because the halos in this sample have already gained major parts of their angular momentum from infall along the filaments .",
    "the merger sample is still in a phase of accretion and it is expected that additional infall along the filaments will bring the merger sample into better agreement with the steady accretion sample .",
    "the correlations in the orientations and the angular momenta for the gas and the dark matter components show very similar behaviour , supporting the search for alignment effects in large x - ray samples of clusters of galaxies .",
