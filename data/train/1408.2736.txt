    "<S> we demonstrate that a nanopillar driven by a spin - transfer torque is equivalent to a rotating magnetic plate , which permits to consider the nanopillar as a macroscopic system under a time modulated injection of energy , that is , a simple parametric resonator . </S>",
    "<S> this equivalence allows us to characterize the phases diagram and to predict magnetic states and dynamical behaviors , such as solitons , stationary textures and oscillatory localized states , among others . </S>",
