    "scale - free networks , i.e.  networks with essentially power - law degree distributions , have recently been widely studied ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "such degree distributions have been found in many different contexts , for example in several technological webs like the internet @xcite , the www @xcite , or electrical power grids , and also in social networks , like the network of sexual contacts @xcite or one of the phone calls @xcite .",
    "the standard model reproducing scale free degree distributions was introduced by barabsi and albert ( ba - model ) @xcite .",
    "it is based on a growth algorithm with preferential attachment .",
    "a second older model which is also widely studied in the context of scale - free networks is the configuration model treated by molloy and reed ( mr - model ) @xcite .",
    "this is to some extent the ` most random ' model possessing a given degree distribution @xmath0 and a given number @xmath1 of nodes .",
    "the building prescription starts with sets of @xmath2 nodes with @xmath3 stubs each .",
    "the stubs are then connected randomly to each other ; two connected stubs form a link .",
    "double bonds and autoconnections can be neglected in the limit of large networks @xmath4 .",
    "mr - networks exhibit an arbitrary degree distribution but no correlations , i.e. the distribution of nodes on one end of a link is independent from that on the other end of the link . for the ba - model",
    "there are non - trivial correlations between neighboring nodes . for both networks",
    "the correlations can not be influenced by the construction algorithm .",
    "in contrast to that , real networks exhibit a wide range of different correlations .",
    "for example , some are assortative @xcite while others are dissortative @xcite ( i.e.  nodes are generally attached to nodes with similar degree or not ) .",
    "it has been noted for some time , that the failure to include into the standard models this wide range of different correlations is a considerable defect of the models .",
    "so , a lot of effort has been put into the solution of this problem ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this publication aims to contribute to this effort .",

    ", it has been examined in considerable detail for correlations between neighboring nodes .",
    "the generalization from correlations between neigboring nodes to those of arbitrary range might be considered only a small advance . however , since there is no full knowledge about the actual correlations in natural networks , correlations of long range should not be neglected a priori . as simple examples can prove , sometimes only correlations of long range have a decisive influence on important topological properties like the percolation threshold .    thus far ,",

    "related work can be found in @xcite . there , newman studies the influence of mixing on the size of the giant component by mimicking percolation with the change of a characteristic degree scale .",

    "this algorithm should be especially useful in the examination , which correlations are important and which correlations can be neglected in real networks .",
    "for example , it will be helpful to answer a question of the following type : how far is the range of correlations that must be considered to determine the percolation threshold of a certain network up to a certain error ?",
    "[ fig : genms2 ] presents the algorithm where the network is randomized regarding all correlations of range longer than one , i.e.  only the correlations between next neighbors are kept :    * choose randomly one motif link - node ( with node - degree @xmath3 ) in the network .",
    "* choose another motif that has the same topology link - node ( with the same degree @xmath3 ) .",
    "* exchange the parts attached to the end of the link .",
    "a motif consists of a small connected neighborhood and possibly dangling edges attaching to some nodes of the neighborhood .",
    "we see that in the process the distribution of paths of length one stays the same",

    "this network has a percolation threshold @xmath113 ( cf .",
    ".  [ eq : percthrs ] ) . replacing links by motifs link - node - link",
    ", we integrate new nodes in the network in a manner that the resulting degree distribution @xmath114 follows a power - law with an exponent @xmath115 .",
    "we consider these two possibilities :    1 .",
    "we integrate the new nodes in a way , that the resulting network corresponds to a mr - model .",
    "we assign a certain number @xmath116 of the new nodes to each existing node i with degree @xmath109 . with those @xmath116 nodes",
    "we build a neighborhood around i that has exactly @xmath109 outgoing links ( cf .  for example fig .",
    "[ fig : nba ] ) .",
    "this yields the following percolation thresholds :    1 .",
    "@xmath117 , because the second moment of the degree distribution @xmath114 diverges .",
    "@xmath118 , because the resulting network with degree distribution @xmath114 has a superstructure : a network with degree distribution @xmath111 where the nodes are finite - size neighborhoods .",
    "this superstructure determines an upper boundary for the percolation threshold .",
    "note that it might well be possible to ensure that both networks also have the same degree correlations .",
    "so , apparently it plays an important role for the value of the percolation threshold , if additional links are only added to a neighborhood or connect distant parts of the network .",
    "consequently , it is an interesting question , how many links of the internet or social networks connect only nodes that already belong to the same neighborhood .",
    "we stress that contrary to the ba- and mr - models real networks seldom exhibit local tree - structure , indicating redundant linking in neighborhoods .",
    "this points to common interests or properties of nodes .",
    "for example in social networks these may be : geographic location , language , age or level of education .",
    "it is an obvious failure of the ba - model , that it does not implement clustering .",
    "the clustering coefficient tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit ( number of triangles divided by number of pairs of adjacent edges , i.e.  edges with at least one identical endpoint ) .",
    "we suggest here a simple extension of the ba - model that allows to influence clustering , while it preserves the degree distribution of the ba - model .",
    "we assume that every new node added to the network brings with it @xmath119 proper links .",
    "these proper links connect the new node with nodes in the network according to different criteria .",
    "for example , in a friendship - network , every individual would have the right to choose two friends . the first friend he chooses from people who do the same job as he .",
    "the second friend he chooses from people who have the same favorite hobby .",
    "both times he preferably chooses those people that already have a lot of friends ( i.e.  preferential attachment ) .    the new feature compared with the ba - model is , that at its introduction we assign to each node @xmath120 two parameters , a job - parameter @xmath121 and a hobby - parameter @xmath122 .",
    "each new node has a job - link and a hobby - link .",
    "now , according to preferential attachment we first determine the degree @xmath8 of node 1 , that the job - link shall attach to . then we search for that node 1 that has the @xmath123 closest to @xmath124 , corresponding to the best matching of common interests .",
    "the same procedure determines node 2 , that the hobby - link of @xmath120 attaches to .",
    "qualitatively , the clustering depends on the correlations between the parameters @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "we choose @xmath124 uniformly at random .",
    "@xmath125 is chosen depending on the value @xmath124 .",
    "there are two limiting cases :    1 .",
    "the choice of @xmath125 is independent from the choice of @xmath124 .",
    "then our model corresponds exactly to the ba - model with @xmath119 and exhibits a vanishing clustering coefficient .",
    "2 .   @xmath126",
    ". then the clustering is maximal .",
    "for the second case , when the degrees @xmath8 and @xmath7 of nodes 1 and 2 are equal a double bond is formed .",
    "if as an additional rule we prohibit double bonds , the second link shall be connected to a node 2 with the parameter closest to @xmath127 but unequal node 1 . in this model",
    "the clustering is maximal , because the probability that nodes 1 and 2 are neighbors is maximal . in the case",
    "that 1 and 2 are neighbors a new triangle is formed in the network .",
    "another important feature of the second limiting case is that the clustering coefficient is independent of the network size .",
    "this is proven in the following way : the probability , that a node @xmath25 of degree @xmath128 has a neighbor of degree @xmath129 , depends only on the degrees of the nodes and not on the network size .",
    "if node @xmath25 has a neighbor @xmath130 of degree @xmath129 , then the distribution for the difference in parameters @xmath131 is independent of the network - size .",
    "this guarantees that the probability , that the two nodes 1 and 2 ( in the growth algorithm presented above ) are connected , is independent of the network size .",
    "thus , the probability , that with a new node also a new triangle is added to the network is independent of the network size . from the fact , that with every node three pairs of adjacent edges are added to the network and with a constant probability sometimes a triangle , it follows , that the clustering coefficient is independent of @xmath1 ( at least for @xmath1 large ) .",
    "a generalization of this model is straightforward .",
    "let @xmath132 be the probability , that two nodes @xmath25 and @xmath130 with degrees @xmath128 and @xmath129 and with difference in parameters @xmath133 are neighbors .",
    "if the parameter @xmath125 for the new nodes is chosen such , that @xmath132 stays constant with growing network size @xmath1 , then the clustering coefficient is approximately independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this should be the case for a scale - invariant probability distribution for the choice of @xmath125 for node i : @xmath134 with some arbitrary function @xmath56 .",
    "let us finally note , that this is a plausible condition for friendship networks , but also for many other networks .",
    "the pool of possible friends , from which a new person can choose , is always independent of the network size .",
    "when somebody comes to a new city to make friends , for his choice , it does not matter , how many people are living on the whole earth .",
    "he will choose his friends from his immediate neighborhood ( mathematically these neighborhoods are characterized by similarity in the parameters @xmath72 ) .",
    "the only difference is that with growing network size , i.e.  population on the earth , the parameter interval is renormalized .",
    "the parameters of people in one city then lie closer together , the differences are simply scaled .",
    "empirically , the network size @xmath1 does not influence the person s choice of friends , though .",
    "the parameters @xmath135 and @xmath136 can of course be identified with two - dimensional coordinates in a geography . a generalization to more than two parameters is straight - forward . in summary",
    "we can say that the clustering in our example network is larger , when people with the same job tend to have the same hobbies .",
    "this very general outline was supposed to show the origin of network - size - invariant clustering and appearance of neighborhoods ( with loops ) in real networks .",
    "we discussed a general model for correlated random networks  where correlations can have arbitrary range .",
    "we presented two algorithms to produce or examine those networks .",
    "one , a generalization of a randomization algorithm by maslov and sneppen , should be helpful in examining the influence of correlations in real networks .",
    "especially the question , which range of correlations is important , can be answered .",
    "we derived a set of equations ( [ final1 ] ) and ( [ final2 ] ) determining the percolation threshold for this model and verified the result by different methods . in the end",
    "we added a few general remarks concerning clustering  a measure of the amount of triangles in a network  and more generally concerning the existence of loops .",
    "for both correlations and loops their influence on topological properties like the percolation threshold of a network is not yet fully understood .",
    "we suggested very shortly a mechanism for the emergence of network - size - invariant clustering in real networks ."
