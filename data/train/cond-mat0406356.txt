    "phosphorus is one of the major causes of embrittlement of nuclear reactor pressure vessel ( rpv ) steels@xcite .",
    "a huge enhancement of the concentration of phosphorus ( p ) atoms at grain boundaries is observed in samples of rpv steels taken from nuclear reactors@xcite .",
    "this leads to a decrease in the grain boundary cohesion and consequently to a shift of the ductile - to - brittle transition temperature .",
    "a theoretical understanding of the problem requires a full understanding of the interaction of millions of these two atoms at the atomic level .",
    "first principles calculations provide the most reliable way to describe interactions , but they are impractical for large scale molecular dynamics . hence there is a need for accurate descriptions of the energy based on interatomic potentials which do not treat the electrons explicitly .    a crucial aspect of atomic - level modelling is proper relaxation of atoms around the defect , for which elegant methods were developed by michael norgett@xcite . with state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ methods it is now possible to treat a few hundred movable atoms : just as with empirical potentials in the seventies this brings problems of finite size effects to the fore and many of the concepts pioneered by michael norgett and encapsulated in his devil@xcite ( defect evaluation in lattices ) code are being revisited today , and indeed many of the applications such as dislocation core structure@xcite and twin boundaries@xcite are still debated .    here",
    "we present the derivation of an interatomic potential for the fe - p which can be evaluated as quickly as a short ranged pairwise potential . for molecular dynamics purposes in studying reactor steels ,",
    "the interesting region is that of small concentrations ( @xmath0 ) of p in fe , in particular , the behaviour of point defects in lattices .",
    "traditionally , data for fitting potentials came from experiment , typically bulk properties , but recently _ ab initio _ total energy calculation enables us to add more specific atomistic level configurations to the fitting dataset . here",
    "we incorporate both ab initio and experimental data to parameterise a potential for the dilute p - fe system .",
    "we choose to write the potential in the form :    @xmath1 + \\sum_{ij } v(r_{ij})\\ ] ]    for @xmath2=\\sqrt{x}$ ] this is the second - moment tight - binding form of cyrot@xcite and finnis and sinclair@xcite .",
    "this is transferable between environments where the local band structure is primarily changed by scaling@xcite .",
    "we will need to fit seven functions for the two - component system : three pair potentials @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , three pairwise functions @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and two embedding energy functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    a previous parameterization in this form for general properties of iron@xcite gave good qualitative results but was not tailored specifically to defect properties .",
    "recent ab initio work@xcite shows that at high densities the resistance to compression arises from a many - body effect ( electronic kinetic energy ) rather than a pairwise repulsion .",
    "fitting compression data using the short range part of @xmath11 typically leads to an overestimate of interstitial formation energies and volumes@xcite .",
    "these quantities have recently come into the realm of what can be calculated by ab initio means , and can be used to fit short range repulsion in regions where the density is close to its bulk value .",
    "we have shown that including different things in the fit leads to very different potentials : to describe point defect interactions , one must fit point defect properties .",
    "and so we use an iron potential optimised for point defects as the basis of the present work@xcite .",
    "this incorporates the kinetic energy effect by writing @xmath12 , with increasing @xmath13 taking us smoothly between hopping and free - electron dominated regimes .",
    "hence isotropic compression is dealt with by the many - body term ( high @xmath13 ) , while short atom - atom distances can be addressed with the pair potential @xmath11 .",
    "this modest change to the second - moment formalism gives greater fitting flexibility and no additional computing cost , since @xmath14 is implemented as a look up table .",
    "pure p is covalently bonded and can not be described by this type of potential .",
    "we therefore do not attempt to fit properties of pure phosphorus , or phosphorus - rich compounds , concentrating instead on point defects in @xmath15iron , their interactions with phosphorus atoms and fictitious iron - rich compounds .",
    "to parameterise the potential we use data generated from _ ab initio _ plane wave pseudopotential calculations using density functional theory@xcite , ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite , the spin - dependent generalised gradient approximation for exchange and correlation@xcite and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "calculations on pure iron@xcite suggest that this is a reliable approach , it has been deployed widely and the calculations can be routinely done using standardised software@xcite .    there is an additional caveat for ferromagnetic materials : the magnetism ( and hence fermi level ) is affected by defects and this leads to a much slower convergence of the energy with system size ( and k - point sampling ) than is typically observed for non - magnetic elements@xcite .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the fermi energy moves relative to the spin - bands in the supercell calculation , whereas for a truly infinite crystal the bands are fixed . despite this slow convergence of defect energy , the energy differences between e.g. different interstitial configurations converge much more rapidly@xcite .",
    "thus we are justified in fitting energy differences from calculations using relatively small unit cells , while obtaining the absolute formation energy from larger calculations .",
    "ferromagnetism also means that the band structure changes dramatically at the fcc - bcc phase transition iron . for this reason@xcite",
    "we do not expect the potential to describe paramagnetic iron correctly : high - t fcc - bcc transitions have been observed with other iron potentials but the driving force is vibrational ( entropic ) not magnetic @xcite .",
    "the fitting strategy assumes that phosphorus interacts with point defects via short - ranged , pairwise interactions and long - range strain fields .",
    "thus we include configurations representing point defects , single substitutional impurity ( ssi ) phosphorus atoms , and combinations thereof .",
    "since the major problem associated with phosphorus is segregation to grain boundaries , we include fe with a 2d layer of p in our fitting database . by fitting relaxation volumes ,",
    "we capture long - range strain effects .",
    "we also include liquid configurations to ensure that the functions are sampled at all separations@xcite .",
    "the ab initio calculations and configurations included in the fitting are given in tables[tab : crystal],[tab : int],[tab : v ] .",
    "our ab initio calculations use small unit cells which introduces problems of images and relaxation@xcite for considering isolated defects .",
    "however , by fitting _ the same _ small cells described by the potential , we alleviate this problem .    the most crucial aspect for radiation damage is the geometry of the defects and barriers ( which governs diffusion mechanisms ) and the energy differences between them ( which governs diffusion rates ) .",
    "`` geometry '' here includes the symmetry of the defects and their p - composition , but not detailed interatomic separations .",
    "similarly important are the interaction strengths between phosphorus and point defects , which determine whether pinning of defects occurs . of secondary importance",
    "are the actual values of the formation energies : this affects production rates in cascade simulations , but in a molecular dynamics run defects are very unlikely to be generated thermally .",
    "our _ ab initio _ calculations are done using standard codes@xcite , implementing the pseudopotential plane wave method using density functional theory@xcite , ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite , the spin - dependent generalised gradient approximation for exchange and correlation@xcite and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the plane wave cutoff of 300ev has been used throughout with @xmath16-point convergence to 0.01ev , force convergence to 0.001ev / a and strees to 0.01 kb .",
    "previous ab initio calculations on iron - phosphorus@xcite using the similarly - reliable full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method have downplayed total energy and concentrated on the role of increased electron density as indicating strengthening of the bonds at the surface relative to the grain boundary .",
    "this qualitative picture is not specific to fep and follows from the tight - binding formalism@xcite .",
    "we observe similar increased electron densities in our calculations of a single layer of p in fe , but do not use them in fitting .",
    "the actual energies calculated by dft relative to the free atom are known to be unreliable .",
    "likewise , the finnis sinclair formalism can not be expected to be transferrable to free atoms .",
    "thus we do not at any stage fit the ab initio energies directly , rather , we fit relative energies between different configurations of the same number and type of atoms .",
    "we take the experimental cohesive energy for @xmath17-iron ( 4.316ev / atom ) , but the cohesive energy for phosphorus is not fitted ( and nor is the crystal structure of pure phosphorus ) .",
    "all fits are to energy differences with phosphorus in various locations , with the single substitutional impurity taken as the reference state .",
    "several crystal structures were examined and used in the fitting . at the fe@xmath18p composition we looked at fictitious l1@xmath19 ( fcc equivalent ) , do@xmath18 and do@xmath20 ( bcc equivalents ) and a bcc - based structure with every fourth ( 001 ) layer replaced by phosphorus .",
    "do@xmath18 was noticably lower in energy .",
    "we also calculated fe@xmath19p , a complex structure which does exist experimentally , finding excellent agreement a=5.836 ( expt 5.865 ) , c=3.436 ( expt 3.456 ) , u=0.257 ( expt 0.256 ) , v=0.591 ( expt 0.594 ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that the ab initio calculations are reliable for the system .",
    "results are given in table.[tab : crystal ] .",
    "to include fracture - relevant data , we evaluated surface energies for pure fe , fe with a monolayer of p at the surface , and fe with a monolayer of p one layer below the surface ( there is evidence that p - rich grain boundary fracture occurs by breaking of fe - fe bonds adjacent to the boundary , rather than fe - p bonds at the boundary . )",
    "the results show that phosphorus does not segregate into a monolayer , either in bulk or on the surface , and that a free ( 001 ) surface with p on it has a higher energy than without ( taking substitutional phosphorus as the reference state ) . assuming replacement of iron by p",
    ", the segregation to grain boundaries must result from the different crystalline environment there rather than an intrinsic tendency of p to form layers ( by extension , some grain boundaries will be more susceptible than others ) .",
    "moreover , the fracture embrittlement probably arises from a stress concentration effect rather than a simple griffith - criterion energy balance .",
    "we note however that some experimental evidence@xcite suggests that p sits in hollow sites on fe(001 ) - investigating all such possible reconstructions by _ ab initio _ calculation would be impractical , hence the need for reliable potentials .",
    "phosphorus has a small range of solid solubility in fe , and is believed to be located substitutionally .",
    "several configurations were calculated : a single p atom in a 16(54 ) ( @xmath21(@xmath22 ) bcc ) supercell and a pair of p atoms on neighbouring sites in similar cells . in each case",
    "all ions were relaxed and we took the calculations to k - point convergence ( 729/216 k - points ) .",
    "we compared the effects of fixing the lattice parameter at the pure fe value , or relaxing it to minimise energy ( see table .",
    "[ tab : int ] ) .",
    "the finite size effects going from 16 to 54 atoms were only about 0.1ev , within the fitting errors . in practice",
    "the fe@xmath23p - ssi value is used as the p reference state .",
    "the addition of p impurities causes a striking reduction of 10 - 15% in the stiffness of iron .",
    "we calculate elastic constants by applying finite strains and measuring resultant stress .",
    "our calculations for pure iron give elastic constants of c@xmath24=225gpa , c@xmath25=124gpa , c@xmath26=101gpa , some 10% lower than experiment ( and therefore not included in the fitting ) .",
    "calculations on the fe@xmath23p substitutional impurity supercell ( 6.25% p ) give c@xmath24=196gpa , c@xmath25=109gpa , c@xmath26=91gpa .      with a 31-atom fe unit cell",
    ", we find a vacancy formation energy of 1.94ev compared to the fully converged value of 1.95ev@xcite . with 30 + 1 atoms , the energy required to create a vacancy adjacent to a substitutional phosphorus is 1.64ev for the near neighbour site and 1.72ev for the second neighbour site .    for 15-atom supercells ,",
    "the energies are 1.71ev for the near - neighbour site and 2.18ev for the second neighbour site , this latter suggests a p - vacancy repulsion , but the cell is so small that the calculation actually represents an alternating chain p - vacancy - p - vacancy , so we neglect it .    we estimate the migration barrier by replacing two atoms in pure fe with one located at their midpoint@xcite and relaxing the remaining atoms while constraining the mirror plane symmetry .",
    "as we shall see , in bcc this is not necessarily the barrier for a ( @xmath27 ) hop but it does represent a useful configuration to include in the fitting .",
    "the energy for p to hop from the near neighbour site into the vacancy is much lower than for the direct second neighbour [ 001 ] hop : in the fitting we ensure that the latter barrier is high enough not to be surmountable in md .",
    "in common with experiment@xcite and previous work@xcite we find the [ 011]fe - fe dumbbell configuration to be the stable interstitial .",
    "geometrically , the migration mechanism for an [ 011 ] interstitial could go via the [ 111 ] , tetrahedral , octahedral or [ 001 ] configuration - our calculations suggest the tetrahedral and [ 111 ] configurations are similar in energy .",
    "dynamically , it is also possible that a process of excitation to ( 111 ) followed by fast 1d migration may be favoured@xcite .",
    "although we use smaller supercells without relaxation , the difference in energies from larger calculations can be approximated by elasticity@xcite , and the differences between various conformations ( which is what we fit ) are converged to within the accuracy with which we can fit them . when one or two phosphorus atoms form part of the interstitial the energy is lowered compared with an iron interstitial and substitutional phosphorus , and the stable configuration remains the [ 011 ] dumbbell .",
    "we use a self - consistent process to model liquids , starting with pair potentials@xcite and md to create a `` typical '' atomic - level model of liquid fe - p alloy ( 84 fe atoms , 12 p ) .",
    "then the total forces acting on each atom in this model are obtained from static first principles calculations .",
    "we then use dynamical refitting@xcite via force matching@xcite to produce a new trial potential and generate a new `` typical '' liquid configuration with classical md .",
    "the process is then iterated to self - consistency .",
    "liquid configurations provide data across the range of possible fe - p separations , including small separations which are absent in equilibrium crystal data at t=0 , and ensure there are no anomalous wiggles in the potential at separations for which there is no data .",
    "in addition to the _ ab initio _ calculations above , other properties of pure iron fitted to experiment are c@xmath24=1.517ev / @xmath28 , c@xmath25=0.861ev / @xmath28 , c@xmath26=0.761ev / @xmath28 , and cohesive energy of 4.316ev .",
    "we choose to parameterise the potential using a polynomial spline functional form .",
    "this choice is arbitrary , but does not constrain the physical behaviour - we have shown@xcite that a liquid simulation using a cubic spline fit can be used to fit a reciprocal power series potential , and the resulting @xmath29 and @xmath30 are indistinguishable .",
    "thus    @xmath31    @xmath32    for the extreme short range repulsion , which is sampled only by the primary knock - on atom in a cascade simulation and not by any of our fitting data , we adopt the screened electrostatic form of biersack and ziegler@xcite .    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the nuclear charges and where @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37    in these equations , @xmath38 is the heaviside function and @xmath39 the bohr radius .",
    "the @xmath40 coefficients are determined by continuity of the potential and its derivative , and so the parameters available for fitting are the @xmath41 , @xmath42 and c.    we take @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath9 from our previous paper@xcite .",
    "the @xmath45s are taken by scaling the pure iron values .",
    "the implicit assumption is that in the rigid band picture , the tight binding energy goes parabolically with number of valence d - electrons : ( 10-n)n .",
    "we assume that in the dilute alloy the 3 phosphorus @xmath46-electrons end up in an unchanged d - band .",
    "this suggests that the bond strength is e.g. @xmath47 the squaring coming from the assumption that the embedding function is a square root .",
    "obviously , this means that the potential is invalid for high phosphorus concentration .    to fit the remaining parameters , we use a weighted least squares fit to the lattice parameter and formation energy for several fe@xmath18p compounds ( d0@xmath18 , l1@xmath19 , stripe ) , the relative energies of defect structures ( including the @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 mixed interstitial configurations ) , vacancy -substitutional interaction and vacancy migration energies from the first principles calculations .    in the weighting ,",
    "prime importance was placed on those configurations expected to be seen in simulation , the stable [ 110 ] interstitial , the substitutional phosphorus and the migration barriers . while other configurations were less",
    "strongly weighted , we ensured that they remained sufficiently high in energy that they would not subsequently participate spuriously in dynamics .",
    "for the defects , as with the liquid , the fitting process is a self - consistent one - we fit to unrelaxed defect configurations to obtain a trial potential , relax the configuration using this potential , then refit the potential to the new configuration .",
    "after several iterations , a self - consistent set of defect and liquid configurations , energies and potential parameters is obtained .",
    "this process means that the interatomic distances found in the _ ab initio _ are not fitted .",
    "once a fit had been obtained , the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 were tested _",
    "ab oculo _ for overfitting and md simulations for thermal expansion , elastic moduli ( fig.[fig : therm ] ) , vacancy and interstitial migrations and liquid state diffusion were done as a check for pathologies .",
    "the parameters for the final potential are given in table [ tab : para ] .",
    "the models of p atom segregation proposed so far@xcite are developed for the case when the binding energy of a phosphorus - interstitial complex is small . specifically that the mean free path until thermally - activated dissociation is much shorter than the mean distance between sinks of point defects .",
    "this condition is needed to justify the detailed balance approximation , required for the concentration of p - interstitial complexes to be a function of the local concentration of p atoms .",
    "our _ ab initio _ calculations show that the binding energy of a fe - p mixed dumbbell is not small , and hence this approximation is not valid .",
    "indeed , the large binding energy and small migration energy of an fe - p interstitial complex implies that during the lifetime of this complex the probability that it will dissociate thermally is small . for",
    "a typical value of phosphorus concentration in rpv steels , @xmath0 , the mean free path of an irradiation - produced fe - fe dumbbell before encountering a p atom is several nanometres .",
    "hence , the majority of interstitials arriving at a gb ( or any other sink of point defects ) will contain phosphorus atoms . as a consequence of the phosphorus - interstitial complex",
    "should be treated as a single migrating entity in methods such as kinetic monte carlo .",
    "our results also show significant vacancy - p atom interaction energy : the binding energy of this complex to be @xmath51ev .",
    "this was not expected previously and in the model by lidiard@xcite this interaction was totally neglected .",
    "even more importantly the interaction is long - ranged , at least up to the second neighbour atoms , which invalidates the simple models@xcite for diffusion coefficients in fe - p alloy .",
    "their conclusion , that in bcc alloys solute atoms always drift up the vacancy concentration gradient@xcite , must be re - examined allowing for longer ranged interactions and complex formation .",
    "the long - range vacancy - phosphorus interaction in bcc iron makes it possible for a vacancy to move around the p atom , while remaining bound as a complex . as a consequence",
    "the situation may become similar to fcc alloys , where the diffusion coefficient of a solute atom can be positive ( indicating drag of solute atoms ) or negative ( simple exchange ) depending on the relative frequencies of vacancy jumps between two neighbour sites of the solute atom and away from the solute atom .",
    "hence , it is possible that vacancies would drag p atoms to sinks of point defects .",
    "the small energy for the vacancy p atom exchange jump ( relative to that of vacancy iron atom ) implies that the diffusion coefficient of phosphorus atoms via a vacancy mechanism would be independent of this energy .",
    "the potential shows that the barrier for first - to - second neighbour jumps is similar to barriers in pure fe .",
    "finally , the conclusion@xcite that the migration of phosphorus atoms to grain boundaries is predominantly via the interstitials has to be verified in the view of strong long ranged interaction of vacancy p atom complexes , and smaller production rates of single interstitials than single vacancies in high - energy displacement cascades in @xmath17-iron due to higher intra - cascade clustering of interstitial atoms .",
    "we have performed simulations of diffusion for point defects in fep using the potential defined in table.[tab : para ] .",
    "we find that vacancies diffuse freely in iron , but are attracted to and form complexes with the p atoms .",
    "although the phosphorus atom can move into the vacant site , in isolation this would simply produce a thermally activated oscillation , and no net diffusion - the vacancy has to hop out to second neighbour sites and back again for comigration to occur . using static relaxation",
    ", we calculated the various barriers to vacancy jumps in the vicinity of a p atom ( fig.[fig : vhop ] ) .",
    "a near - neighbour hop in bcc crosses two intermediate ( 111 ) planes , so the barriers tend to be bimodal .",
    "although the p - v migration barrier is only half that of the fe - v barrier , to obtain long range p migration the vacancy has to hop around the p via second neighbours .",
    "energetics ( both ab initio and with the potential ) show the p to be bound to the vacancy in both first and second neighbour sites , however from the second neighbour site the barriers are similar for hopping back or further away from the p. thus p acts as a strong vacancy trap , and comigration is likely .",
    "we performed some preliminary md simulations using the potential with 2000 atoms to check the mechanism and ensure against pathological behaviour .",
    "for 1200k , with a single p interstitial , a series of 1d migration steps were observed for about 80ps , after which the interstitial dissociated from the p atom and standard 3d migration in pure fe continued . at 920k and 600k , however , the mixed interstitial did not separate and migration was more three dimensional ( fig.[bara : mig ] ) .",
    "interstitials diffuse freely in pure iron , and are strongly attracted to substitutional p. the p - fe mixed dumbbell is also highly mobile , and the p diffuses rapidly . thus p - diffusion occurs primarily via interstitials in radiation damage conditions where fe - fe interstitials are commonplace . under thermal conditions however , interstitial mediated segregation to boundaries will not occur since there is no source for interstitials in the bulk , and mixed interstitials formed at sinks can not transport further p - atoms to the sink",
    ".    the stability of small complexes suggests , however , that still larger complexes may be important .",
    "for example mixed interstitials may be pinned by other p atoms , forming sessile pp interstitials .",
    "future molecular dynamics can incorporate features neglected by this model , such as clustering , recombination , segregation and the specific defect distributions associated with thermal , electron or neutron radiation .",
    "we have developed an interatomic potential for the @xmath17-fe - p system in the limit of low - p concentration with particular importance attached to configurations observed under radiation damage .",
    "this potential gives a good description of point defect properties and conformations , in particular vacancy and interstitial complexes with a p atom and hence can be used in larger scale molecular dynamics or monte carlo simulations to study diffusion properties and segregation of p during both ageing and irradiation conditions .",
    "pure phosphorus can not be described by this type of potential .",
    "the potential predicts that phosphorus is strongly bound to both vacancy and interstitial defects , in accordance with _ ab initio _ results .",
    "this fact has not been expected previously , and conclusions of theoretical studies that ignore strong p - defect binding should be reexamined .",
    "we have presented prelimnary molecular dynamics studies of p diffusion in iron which show the potential to be free from pathologies , but a quantative study of these processes ( which should include larger complexes ) in beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it appears that in the temperature region of interest for rpv steels p would migrate rapidly via both interstitial and vacancy complex mechanisms , although we have not studied large complexes which may further complicate the process .",
