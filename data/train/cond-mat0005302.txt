    "bose - einstein condensation of an ideal gas is typically presented in introductory textbooks solely in terms of particle numbers . and",
    "quantum mechanically enhanced number densities were the ` smoking gun ' observed in the first experiments on dilute gas condensates .",
    "but many phenomena of interacting condensates depend critically on the conjugate quantity to particle number , namely the quantum mechanical phase @xcite .",
    "one can have highly occupied states with or without phase coherence between them , and the presence or absence of phase coherence can make a dramatic difference in the physical properties of an ultra - cold gas . as in the case of a gas held in an optical lattice , which can be a superfluid or a mott insulator depending on the strength of the lattice , the onset or loss of phase coherence can even be a phase transition @xcite .    since the global phase of a condensate is unobservable , the simplest system in which phase coherence can be manifested consists of two states , occupied by a large number of bosons .",
    "as such a system can realistically be approximated by a condensate in a double well , it has recently attracted attention @xcite . in these works , josephson oscillations and the phase coherence between two coupled condensate",
    "were studied considering time independent coupling parameters . in @xcite the disappearance of the phase coherence between the two wells due to a change in time of the tunneling coupling has been studied .",
    "the coupling parameters and the related phase coherence properties depend on the potential barrier between the two wells , since in the limit where the barrier is very low we have a single condensate and in the limit where the barrier is very high we have two completely separated condensates . even if , at least in the high barrier limit , it has often been pointed out how to relate the coupling parameters ( on - site energy and tunneling coupling ) to the overlap of the wavefunctions localised in the two wells , this has never really been taken explicitly into account . introducing the spatial degrees of freedom , as we did ,",
    "allows us to relate all that to the potential barrier in a more than phenomenological way and becomes expecially important in the study of the dynamics of the process , because the wavefunctions change drastically in time and collective modes are excited .    in this paper",
    "we examine this problem and develop a method which can be extended to the case of many wells , in order to encompass the turning on of an optical lattice in a condensate , allowing to go beyond a gross - pitaevkii treatment , as the one done for example in @xcite .",
    "the physical situation is similar to the ones already realized experimentally , where a double well potential was created by shining a far - off resonant laser beam in the center of the magnetic trap ( see e.g. @xcite ) or where an array of traps was created by on optical standing wave @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the full dynamics of the process : in addition to the phase coherence properties , we want to study the excitation of the collective modes by taking the spatial dependence of the condensate wavefunction explicitly into account .",
    "the price of including all these effects without assuming mean field theory is that we must use a time - dependent variational approach , choosing variational ansatz to describe both the `` internal '' and `` external '' dynamics ( that is , the distribution of particles between two motional states treated as given , and the evolution of the spatial wave functions of these states ) .",
    "this allows us to reduce the intractable full problem to a set of coupled differential equation for our few variational parameters .",
    "although the time - dependent variational approach is not guaranteed to be quantitatively accurate , it allows qualitatively important processes to be investigated , and it has proven surprisingly reliable in previous applications to condensate physics @xcite .",
    "here we use it to derive the coupling between the internal and external dynamics , investigate which are the conditions under which the two can be decoupled , and identify the typical time scales for both .    in sec .",
    "[ model ] we briefly present our two - state model and discuss qualitatively the behaviour of the system that our model can explain . in sec .",
    "[ ansatz ] , we introduce explicitly the variational ansatz we choose to describe the phase dynamics and the collective modes . after introducing the time ",
    "dependent variational principle and deriving the lagrangian , we write the equations of motion for the variational parameters . then in sec .",
    "[ decouple ] we discuss the conditions under which it is an accurate approximation to neglect the coupling between internal and external degrees of freedom .",
    "this decoupling allows us to model both internal and external evolution in a still simpler way .",
    "the external dynamics is studied in sec .",
    "[ finexc ] , comparing simple analytic models with numerical results .",
    "[ numres ] is devoted to the internal dynamics , where the statics is studied and analytic estimates obtained . with these decoupled studies to guide expectations , the full variational equations of motion , with coupled internal and external degrees of freedom , will be studied numerically in sec .  [ results ] .",
    "the results are compared with those of the phase model describing the relative phase of two weakly coupled superfluids @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a general discussion of our results and their implications .",
    "two appendices define the number difference and relative phase operators , derive the phase model hamiltonian , and show that our variational ansatz adequately represents the evolution generated by it .",
    "let us consider the situation in which we have @xmath0 bosons confined in a harmonic trap at zero temperature .",
    "we slowly deform the trap symmetrically around its center raising a potential barrier , until it becomes a double  well potential .",
    "we want to study the dynamics of the process as well as the final state of the bosons .",
    "we will treat the problem in one dimension .",
    "this describes the situation in which we have a cigar - shaped condensate , and we deform it along the most elongated direction .",
    "nevertheless , our model could be extendend in a straightforward way to @xmath1 and @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "this would just lead to more complicated equations , but would not affect the main results .",
    "the second quantization hamiltonian describing the situation we have in mind and in which particles interact via a @xmath3-pseudopotential is    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the bosonic field operator and @xmath6 is the time ",
    "dependent potential which describes the deformed trap .",
    "here , @xmath7 is an effective coupling constant which depends both on the @xmath8-wave scattering length and on the atomic distribution in the transverse directions .",
    "we assume that at time @xmath9 the atoms are in the ground state of this hamiltonian , and we want to determine the state after the potential is deformed",
    ". this problem can not be solved even numerically ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , we need to consider a simplified model which describes the main features of the process . if the process is completely adiabatic , the final state will be a ` fragmented condensate ' with half of the particles in each of the potential wells : when the two condensates do not interact this is a much lower energy state than the one with phase coherence , because minimizing fluctuations in the relative particle number lowers the energy due to interparticle repulsion .",
    "such a fragmented condensate can be regarded as having two entirely independent condensates .",
    "if we changed the potential very fast , then we would obtain a single condensate that oscillates in each of the potential wells .",
    "we would also expect to see collapses and revivals in the `` condensate phase '' @xcite , provided the losses are not important @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the gross  pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) will not give a good description of the splitting process , in principle .",
    "this equation describes the evolution of a single mode of the condensate @xmath10 , and , therefore , is not valid for fragmented condensates . in order to interpolate between the gross - pitaevskii limit of phase coherence and the limit of two independent condensates",
    ", one needs to consider at least two modes @xmath11 .",
    "then , one can write the state of the atoms as ( we assume @xmath0 to be even )    @xmath12    and @xmath13 are the mode annihilation operators defined as    @xmath14    we have to consider the evolution of the wavefunctions @xmath15 as well as of the coefficients @xmath16 , which will be coupled and governed by the hamiltonian    @xmath17    we will refer to the evolution of those wavefunctions as `` external dynamics '' and to the one of the coefficients as `` internal dynamics '' .    in order to find the mode  functions @xmath15 we can use the variational principle ( in the same way as one derives the gpe from a hartree - fock ansatz ) .",
    "however , this also turns out to be very complicated .",
    "a way around that problem is to express @xmath15 in terms of some few variational parameters : we will use quasi  gaussian functions to describe those mode - functions . on the other hand",
    ", we could also use a variational principle to determine the evolution of the coefficients @xmath16 .",
    "this again turns out to be very complicated , so that we will also use a gaussian ansatz for them .",
    "once they are known , in order to estimate when the condensate is fragmented , we can look at the eigenvalues of the single particle density operator corresponding to the internal dynamics only , that is , the matrix    @xmath18    where @xmath19 mean the expectation value on the state @xmath20",
    ". the eigenvalues @xmath21 indicate whether we have a single condensate ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , or a fragmented one ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "as already extensively discussed in the literature @xcite , the two - mode model has a limited validity in the case of low barrier , when in principle one is not allowed to neglect higher excited modes .",
    "however , it becomes more and more accurate the higher the barrier gets , since in this case the two lower lying modes move closer together in energy compared to the higher ones .",
    "hence it should allow a good description of the splitting process .      before presenting the numerical and analytical result coming from our analysis",
    ", we will briefly discuss the qualitative behavior that we expect from the model under study .",
    "we will show that the equations we will derive for the external and internal dynamics can be decoupled to a very good approximation .",
    "that is , we can first solve the equations for the external dynamics basically taking constant values for the variational parameters describing the coefficients @xmath16 . once these equations are solved , we can use the corresponding wavefunctions @xmath15 to calculate the time ",
    "dependent coefficients for the equations that describe the internal variational parameters . in summary",
    ", once we have solved the equations for the external parameters , we are left with a two  mode model with time  dependent coefficients which contain all information about the external dynamics : they will define the hopping and on - site interaction , whose competition determines the phase relation between the two modes .",
    "regarding the external dynamics , one can see two kinds of behaviors depending on the time scale @xmath25 at which the barrier is raised .",
    "the important time scale with which one has to compare is the oscillation period @xmath26 in the trapping potentials at each time .",
    "these periods change by roughly a factor of two between the initial harmonic potential and the final double well ( with our specific choice of the trapping potential ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath27 the process will be adiabatic with respect to the external dynamics , which means that @xmath11 will basically correspond to the two ground states of the right and left wells at the final time . if @xmath28 we will have collective excitations , in which @xmath11 oscillate strongly . in this case , we will have that the energy of the condensate @xmath29 ( with respect to the ground state energy ) has increased , so that it may be destroyed .",
    "although we can not account for the disappearance of the condensate within our model , we can estimate when this will happen just by considering the fact that under normal circumstances thermalization will occur , and , therefore , the condensate will be destroyed for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the boltzman constant , @xmath33 indicates the critical temperature and @xmath29 is the extra energy in the final state .",
    "we find that the condensate disappears for @xmath34 .",
    "regarding the internal dynamics , there is also a time scale in the problem which determines the dynamics ; this is the revival time @xmath35 . given two condensates with an initial well defined relative phase , it is well  known that the relative phase first disappears ( collapse ) and then is restored at time @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath37 the process will be adiabatic with respect to the internal dynamics , the phase coherence will be lost during the process and therefore we will end up with two independent condensates in each well , with no phase coherence at all ( note that it makes no sense to talk about collapses or revivals in this situation ) . if @xmath38 at the end of the process we will have two condensates with a good phase coherence . in that case , after the splitting , collapses and revivals could be observed provided the particle losses are practically absent .    in summary , we have two important time scales in the problem , namely @xmath26 and @xmath39 .",
    "typically , in experiments @xmath40 , so that it will be harder to be adiabatic with respect to the internal dynamics than to the external one . on the other hand , since @xmath39 is very long in practise , it will be hard to achieve @xmath41 within the validity of our model , in which particle losses and other imperfections are not included .",
    "finally we notice that the external and internal dynamics depend in a very different way on the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath0 . very similar to what happens in the gpe ,",
    "the equations of motion for the parameters describing the external dynamics depend almost only on the product @xmath42 . on the contrary , the on - site energy splitting scales like @xmath7 and the tunneling coupling like @xmath0 giving rise to very different internal dynamics .",
    "for increasing @xmath0 and decreasing @xmath7 the relative phase becomes better defined and the time @xmath39 required to destroy the phase coherence is longer .",
    "in particular in the limit @xmath43 , unless the tunneling coupling exactly vanishes , the gpe case of phase coherent condensate is recovered .",
    "in this section we introduce a variational ansatz to describe the internal and external dynamics . to describe the ground state of the system , which we will call equivalently static or equilibrium solution , two parameters are sufficient : @xmath44 which corresponds roughly to the center of the mode functions , and @xmath45 which is related to the width of the number distribution . to allow dynamic evolution we have to introduce also the variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which will vanish in the static case .",
    "for simplicity in the following we present the variational ansatz for the symmetric case , describing a spatially symmetric double  well potential and a symmetric atomic distribution among the two modes .",
    "starting from symmetric initial conditions ( no unbalance in the population of the two modes and symmetric mode functions @xmath48 ) , the symmetry will be preserved under the time evolution .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to generalize our ansatz to describe asymmetric situations .",
    "we will briefly discuss the corresponding results in the conclusions .",
    "for a single condensate in a harmonic trap , a gaussian ansatz for the wavefunction has proved to be very useful and able to predict the excitation frequencies within a very high precision @xcite . in our case",
    "we make a similar choice . for a very high barrier we expect to find two separate condensates for each of which",
    "a gaussian ansatz should be good .",
    "we then define the two functions for the left and right side :    @xmath49     \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{\\sigma_i}{2}z^2 \\right ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of low barrier ( small @xmath44 ) , these two functions have to be orthogonalized to satisfy the orthonormality property required for the two mode functions .",
    "hence we define    @xmath50    which are different from @xmath51 because of the two different normalization constants for @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the variational parameters describing the mode functions @xmath15 are @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",
    "physically , the excitation modes that these parameters can describe depend on whether the two gaussians significantly overlap in space or not .",
    "if they do , as in the case of low barrier , then the excitation mode ( changes in @xmath44 ) corresponds to a breathing mode .",
    "if they do not overlap , as for high barrier , then it corresponds to an oscillation mode in each of the potential wells . allowing also @xmath54 to vary ( and adding an extra variable for the dynamics ) one can describe more excitation modes",
    ". instead we fix it to a constant value , since the curvature of the potential wells will be chosen to be always of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the value of @xmath54 is not obvious since the overlap integrals depend strongly on it .",
    "for instance the hopping terms can be overestimated due to the long gaussian tales . to fix @xmath54",
    ", we identified a range of values for which the dynamic behaviour of the system was qualitatively the same and choose one of the values within this interval , which turned out to be lower than the one corresponding to the static solution .",
    "since the mode wavefunctions are linear combinations of gaussians , if we choose a trapping potential of the form    @xmath55 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the integrals in eq.([overlapint ] ) can be performed analytically .    in the following , we will use dimensionless units : @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "so , all lengths will be measured in units of harmonic oscillator length , all energy in units of the trap frequency and all times in units of @xmath59 .",
    "we also take for the coefficients @xmath60 a gaussian distribution centered at @xmath61 , @xmath62 , \\label{coeff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is a normalization constant that depends on @xmath45 only .",
    "the variational parameters are @xmath45 and its conjugate one @xmath47 .",
    "the parameter @xmath45 is directly related to the width of the distribution @xmath64 , whereas @xmath47 contributes to the width of the fourier transform of such a distribution ( i.e. , to the width of the phase distribution , see app .",
    "[ varanephmod ] ) .",
    "we study the dynamics using the time dependent variational principle .",
    "to derive the equations of motion one starts by writing the action @xmath65",
    "@xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 have been defined in ( [ 2modeh ] ) and ( [ sumc_m ] ) , respectively . in evaluating the term @xmath69",
    ", one should remember that the state @xmath68 depends on time both through the coefficients and the mode functions contained in @xmath70 :    @xmath71    the lagrangian which follows takes the form    @xmath72 \\nonumber - { \\cal h } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath73 is given by    @xmath74    from the lagrangian ( [ lagr1 ] ) , in general one derives the equations of motion , carrying out the variation with respect to the discrete variables @xmath16 and the fields @xmath75 . in our case , all the integrals and expectation values are functions of the variational parameters which can be calculate analytically .",
    "the only important overlap integrals containing time derivatives are    @xmath76    if one defines    @xmath77    and    @xmath78    the lagrangian becomes    @xmath79    and the corresponding equations of motion are    @xmath80    these equations describe the internal and external coupled dynamics of the splitting of the condensate . in what follows ,",
    "we have solved them numerically in different regimes . before presenting the results",
    "we will show that one can decouple the evolution of the external and internal variables , which helps to understand the dynamics .",
    "for that , we will introduce in the next subsection some analytical approximations to derive explicit formulae for the quantities @xmath81 and @xmath82 by replacing the discrete distribution @xmath16 by a continuous one , and treating the index @xmath83 as a continuous variable running from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .      in order to calculate @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    "we have to evaluate expectation values of the form @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    ". we can do that if we replace the sums in @xmath83 by integrals extended from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "when this replacement is valid , we can even calculate the width of the number distribution @xmath64 , @xmath88 , as well as the one corresponding to the phase distribution , @xmath89 ( see app.[varanephmod ] ) .",

    "the coupling among the @xmath44 dynamics and the @xmath45 dynamics appears in the off - diagonal blocks in eq.([eqmotion ] ) and in the dependence of @xmath81 on all variational parameters . in the following",
    "we will analyze under which condition it is possible to decouple the internal ( @xmath104 ) and external ( @xmath105 ) dynamics , so that one can study them independently one from the other .",

    "this happens either for very few particles , a case in which our model does not hold , since @xmath117 is a fundamental assumption in our model , or for very weakly interacting particles , in which @xmath118 , because the phase coherence is very difficult to be destroyed .",
    "\\(ii ) in the high barrier limit , normally @xmath119 ( see fig .",
    "[ posc ] , small @xmath45 limit ) and @xmath109 might vary abruptly , since this is when the phase coherence is supposed to desappear . anyway , since @xmath120 , the off - diagonal block can be neglected .",

    "this dependence is of order @xmath121 and can be therefore safely neglected ( eqs.([expaaaan1],[expaaaan2 ] ) ) . in the hopping terms",
    ", it scales like @xmath122 ( @xmath123 , see eqs.([expvalaa],[expvalaa2 ] ) ) : it is strong only when the hopping terms are already small and negligible in comparison with the on - site terms , so it can also be neglected .",
    "after these considerations , we conclude that the @xmath44-dynamics is , in a good approximation and in reasonable regimes , independent of the @xmath45-dynamics .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical simulations .",
    "the off - diagonal blocks can be neglected in the @xmath45-dynamics if @xmath124 or @xmath125 .",
    "if the barrier is raised starting from a condensate in the ground state , @xmath44 evolves almost adiabatically in the low barrier limit ( @xmath124 ) ; when it reaches the high barrier limit , then @xmath125 .",

    "one can solve the complete coupled dynamics or substitute in @xmath81 the adiabatic solution for @xmath44 and compare the results .",
    "we will show some examples in the following and see that the difference is small .",
    "in the previous section , we have written the equations of motion describing the full coupled dynamics and demonstrated that if one splits a condensate starting from a ground state configuration , it is possible to decouple the internal and the external dynamics . in this section , we will use this result and study the external dynamics decoupling it from the internal one . making use of the external static solution , in sec .",
    "[ numres ] we will discuss the static solution for the internal degrees of freedom . finally in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we show the results for the internal dynamics , which are also useful as a check of the decoupling assumption .    the fact that the internal and external dynamics decouple under the condition discussed above , allows us to estimate the excitation of the collective modes using a very simple model .",
    "we point out that in this case , similarly to the gross - pitaesvkii equation , the external dynamics is governed by the product @xmath42 and not by the two quantities separately .",
    "we choose to raise the potential barrier with the following time dependence    @xmath127    from the static solution , obtained by minimizing @xmath128 with respect to all variational parameters simultaneously at fixed @xmath129 , we know the equilibrium position of @xmath44 at any value of the barrier .",
    "the @xmath44 dynamics can be approximated very well by the dynamics in a harmonic potential whose center moves from @xmath130 to @xmath131 following the adiabatic solution and whose frequency changes corresponding to the frequency of the small oscillations .    to get analytic estimations , we model this dynamics by fixing the frequency and shifting the center of the potential along a trajectory @xmath132 for which an analytic solution exists .",
    "when the center follows an hyperbolic tangent trajectory with time constant @xmath25 , the semi - amplitude of the oscillation is given by    @xmath133    otherwise , if the center moves according to a linear ramp with time constant @xmath25 , the average semi - amplitude of the oscillation is    @xmath134    we compare in fig.[z0osc ] these expressions with the numerical results . for fast raising of the barrier the hyperbolic tangent shift gives a good estimate . for slower",
    "raising , instead , the amplitude of the oscillations is largely underestimated . in this case , the linear shift of the center is useful to give an upper bound .",
    "we have checked numerically ( by changing the frequency of the harmonic potential in time according to the adiabatic solution ) that the small discrepancy between the actual shift of the center and the hyperbolic tangent dependence is enough to produce such a big change in the amplitude of the final oscillations .",
    "the reason for this might be better understood comparing the time derivative of @xmath132 in the two cases ( see inset in fig.[z0osc](a ) ) .",
    "our estimations are qualitative , but allow us to set some lower and upper bounds and deduce an adiabaticity condition @xmath135 for the external degrees of freedom . in the same way we can estimate the extra energy per particle due to the excitation of collective modes . using the relation @xmath136 ( the trapping frequency at the end of the process is @xmath111 and not @xmath112 ) , we can estimate which is the fastest time scale which does not destroy the condensate .",

    "we have shown that in the classical limit the expectation values @xmath234 and @xmath278 of number and phase ( variational parameters indicating the centers of the respective gaussian distributions ) are governed by the classical phase model hamiltonian .",
    "moreover in the quantum description the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath47 , related to the widths @xmath88 and @xmath97 , are able to reproduce the same features of the time evolution predicted by the phase model , whose limit of validity of the phase model ( derived in app",

    "we discussed the limit of fragmented condensate ( @xmath151 ) and the limit of single phase coherent condensate ( @xmath317 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , for fixed @xmath42 , the limit @xmath43 corresponds to the gross - pitaevkii limit .",
    "infact , unless @xmath318 , if @xmath43 the condensate is always phase coherent . for finite @xmath0 , the above discussion allows to judge whether the gross - pitaevskii description is still valid or not .",

    "this conclusion is similar to the result in @xcite .",
