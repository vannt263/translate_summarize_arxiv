    "magnetic reconnection is a process in which magnetic energy is converted into kinetic and thermal energy of a plasma .",
    "its importance lies in the fact that magnetic reconnection is believed to be one of the underlying mechanisms responsible for many phenomena occurring in astrophysical plasmas , such as solar flares and geomagnetic substorms @xcite .",
    "after the early works of parker @xcite , sweet @xcite and petschek @xcite considerable effort has been made to improve the theory of magnetic reconnection with the help of exact analytical models for reconnective annihilation in cartesian coordinates @xcite .",
    "more recently exact solutions for magnetic reconnection in curvilinear coordinates have been presented @xcite .",
    "some features of these solutions make them particularly interesting for modeling a large class of solar flares . in this paper",
    "we present analytical two - dimensional solutions for reconnective annihilation in polar coordinates which extend the model derived in @xcite to the case of current density distributions depending on both the radial and the azimuthal variable .",
    "we consider the system of magnetohydrodynamics equations in polar coordinates for a two - dimensional steady and incompressible plasma with uniform density and resistivity discussed in @xcite .",
    "this system consists of the equation of motion @xmath0=[a,{\\nabla}^2 a],\\ ] ] and the ohm s law @xmath1=-\\eta{\\nabla}^2 a.\\ ] ] the flux function @xmath2 and the stream function @xmath3 are related to the radial and azimuthal components of the magnetic and velocity field , respectively , in the following way : @xmath4 in ( [ e : ohm2 ] ) @xmath5 represents the normalized electric field which is uniform and perpendicular to the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane while @xmath8 is the dimensionless resistivity corresponding to the inverse magnetic reynolds number .",
    "the poisson brackets are here defined as @xmath9={\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r}}{\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta}}-{\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial r}}{\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta}}.\\ ] ] as shown in @xcite the ansatz @xmath10 @xmath11 is compatible with the system of equations ( [ e : mot2 ] ) and ( [ e : ohm2 ] ) .",
    "in fact the substitution of ( [ e : ansa ] ) and ( [ e : ansp ] ) into ( [ e : mot2 ] ) and ( [ e : ohm2 ] ) yields the following set of four ordinary differential equations for four unknown functions : @xmath12}^{'}= { \\frac{{a_1}'}{r}}{\\left({r{a_1}'}\\right)}^{'}-a_1{\\left[{\\frac{1}{r}}{(r{a_1}')}^{'}\\right]}^{'},\\ ] ] @xmath13}^{'}={\\frac{{a_0}'}{r}}{\\left({r{a_1}'}\\right)}^{'}-a_1{\\left[\\frac{1}{r}{(r{a_0}')}^{'}\\right]}^{'},\\ ] ] @xmath14 @xmath15=0.\\ ] ] where the dash indicates the derivative with respect to @xmath6 . in the limit of ideal mhd , corresponding to @xmath16 , equation ( [ e : i3 ] ) implies @xmath17 with @xmath18 being an arbitrary constant . combining this proportionality relation with eq .",
    "( [ e : i1 ] ) yields @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a parameter related to the variation of the current density with respect to the variable @xmath7 .",
    "for @xmath21 the current density depends only on @xmath6 and the solution of ( [ e : eqa1 ] ) is given by @xmath22 for this particular case approximate and exact solutions of the system ( [ e : i1])-([e : i4 ] ) have been derived ( see @xcite and @xcite respectively ) . for @xmath23 the solutions of ( [ e : eqa1 ] )",
    "depend on the sign of @xmath24 and they are given by @xmath25 @xmath26 where the superscripts of the arbitrary constant @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to the sign of @xmath24 .",
    "these solutions have an analogous counterpart in the trigonometric and hyperbolic sinus solutions derived in @xcite for the corresponding problem in cartesian system of coordinates .",
    "the ideal solutions for @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be derived from ( [ e : i2 ] ) and ( [ e : i4 ] ) setting @xmath16 which yields @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 arbitrary constants .",
    "these solutions are singular in correspondence to the zeros of @xmath34 , therefore they have an infinite number of singularities if the solution @xmath35 is considered and only one singularity if @xmath36 .",
    "it should be mentioned that in absence of an electric field the system possesses regular solutions describing field - aligned flows with one or an infinite number of null and stagnation points depending on the sign of @xmath24 .",
    "singularities in the ideal solutions ( [ e : ida0f0 ] ) can be resolved by means of a finite resistivity . here",
    "we derive solutions for @xmath23 , characterized by current density distributions depending on both @xmath6 and @xmath7 , unlike the case @xmath21 where the current density is purely radially dependent .",
    "for the functions @xmath34 and @xmath37 we assume the following boundary conditions : @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 represent constant values of the radial component of the magnetic and velocity field imposed at the radius @xmath42 , while @xmath43 indicates the radius at which @xmath44 and @xmath45 have a zero .",
    "the ideal solutions ( [ e : br+ ] ) and ( [ e : br- ] ) , as in the case of the logarithmic solution ( [ e : br0 ] ) , can satisfy all of the four boundary conditions ( [ e : obc ] ) and ( [ e : ibc1 ] ) taking the form @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , together with @xmath48 a fundamental difference between the cases @xmath21 and @xmath23 is that for the former the ideal solutions for @xmath34 and @xmath37 provided by ( [ e : prop ] ) and ( [ e : br0 ] ) are also exact solutions of the complete resistive equations ( [ e : i1 ] ) and ( [ e : i4 ] ) . for @xmath23 , however , this is not the case .",
    "in fact , comparing the taylor expansion about @xmath49 of the exact solutions of ( [ e : i1 ] ) and ( [ e : i3 ] ) with the one of the ideal solutions it transpires that a mismatch occurs between @xmath50 and the third derivative of the exact solution for @xmath34 at @xmath49 . due to the high complexity of the nonlinear equations ( [ e : i1 ] ) and",
    "( [ e : i3 ] ) we limit ourselves to solve them in an approximated way .",
    "in particular we seek solutions satisfying the imposed boundary conditions and whose taylor expansions about @xmath49 are compatible with the ones of the exact solutions at least up to the third derivative , in order to resolve the lowest order mismatch between ideal and exact solutions .",
    "since the typical value of the dimensionless resistivity @xmath8 for many astrophysical and laboratory plasmas is between @xmath51 and @xmath52 we can consider @xmath8 as a small parameter and use the method of matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "we separate the problem in two domains , an inner region consisting of a narrow layer containing @xmath49 , where the ideal solution breaks down , and an outer region , complementary to the inner region , where ( [ e : a1pbc ] ) and ( [ e : a1mbc ] ) are approximate solutions .",
    "asymptotic expansions for @xmath34 and @xmath37 are found in the inner region and then matched with the outer zeroth order expansion ( [ e : a1pbc ] ) , ( [ e : a1mbc ] ) and ( [ e : f1pmbc ] ) . in order to derive inner solutions of the nonlinear equations ( [ e : i1 ] ) and",

    "the solutions derived in sec . [ sec : a1f1 ] and [ sec : a0f0 ] describe stationary magnetic and velocity fields whose topologies are nontrivial due to the presence of a magnetic null point at @xmath71 and of a stagnation point at @xmath72(a r_{\\mathrm{c}}+{b}/{r_{\\mathrm{c}}})$ ] .",
    "each of these singular points is located at the intersection of two separatrix lines , one of which , corresponding to the arc @xmath73 , is in common to both points .",

    "[ fig : magvel ] one can also notice that for the branch of solutions matching @xmath87 and @xmath88 the resulting magnetic configuration can be considered as generated by an odd number of sources with alternating polarities lying on the plane @xmath89 .",

    "the latter can not be chosen arbitrarily large because it would then include additional zeros of ( [ e : br+ ] ) where the solutions become singular .",
    "however this is not an additional restriction . indeed ,",
    "as already mentioned above , the exact magnetohydrodynamic solutions for incompressible plasma are usually valid only in a finite size region anyway because of the lower limitation on the pressure . on the other hand ,",

    "this feature has interesting applications to solar physics because the presence of three alternating polarities on the photospheric plane is a feature common to a large class of solar flares @xcite . for one branch of solutions , in general , on the plane",
    "@xmath89 an odd number of sources is present , three of which interacting with each other .",
    "this number depends on the value of the parameter @xmath90 and on the size of the domain of validity of the solutions .",
