    "advanced lattice qcd calculations often require the evaluation of diagrams with disconnected quark lines .",
    "important examples are properties of flavour singlet mesons  @xcite , qcd spectroscopy including multiquark and scattering states  @xcite , the determination of hadronic scattering lengths  @xcite , and of isosinglet contributions to hadronic form factors and structure functions  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "statistical errors of some standard observables like meson masses and electroweak decay constants can be reduced by averaging the sources over the lattice volume . in all these cases",
    "the standard point - to - all propagators that are obtained by calculating twelve ( colour times spin ) columns of the inverse lattice dirac operator are not sufficient .",
    "instead , all - to - all or timeslice - to - all propagators need to be computed .",
    "lattices typically contain a number of sites ranging from @xmath2 up to @xmath3 .",
    "inverting a lattice dirac operator by conventional means would increase the effort in terms of computer memory and operations spent by this factor , relative to the cost of obtaining a single point - to - all propagator .",
    "an alternative approach to the problem consists of calculating an unbiased stochastic estimate of the propagator , replacing a factor @xmath4 in effort by a number @xmath5 of random sources , where in certain situations @xmath5 can be as small as @xmath6 .",
    "such estimation is permissible since , provided it is unbiased , it will only add to the statistical errors .",
    "these are present in any case , due to the path integral evaluation of expectation values of observables by means of a markov monte carlo simulation ( for an introduction into lattice qcd simulations see e.g.@xcite ) .    in general , the additional error introduced by this procedure will , for sufficiently large numbers of estimates @xmath5 , decrease in proportion to @xmath7 .",
    "ideally , @xmath5 should be chosen such that this additional error is smaller than the statistical error induced by the monte carlo time series .",
    "the optimal number will depend on the observable in question and on the prescription employed to calculate the stochastic estimate .",
    "in this article we discuss different improvement methods aimed at decreasing the prefactor of the asymptotic @xmath7 behaviour .",
    "in particular , we will introduce a new such method which we call the truncated solver method ( tsm ) .",
    "we then test combinations of different improved stochastic estimator methods in a realistic lattice qcd simulation . as our benchmark examples we choose to calculate the strangeness contribution to the spin of the nucleon @xmath1 as well as the scalar strangeness content @xmath0 .",
    "the spin of the nucleon can be factorized into a quark spin contribution @xmath8 , a quark angular momentum contribution @xmath9 and a gluonic contribution ( spin and angular momentum ) @xmath10 : @xmath11 in the nave nonrelativistic @xmath12 quark model , @xmath13 , with vanishing angular momentum and gluon contributions . in this case",
    "sea quark contributions will be absent too and therefore there will be no strangeness contribution @xmath1 in the factorization , @xmath14 where in our notation @xmath15 contains both , the spin of the quarks @xmath16 and of the antiquarks @xmath17 .",
    "experimentally , @xmath1 is usually obtained by integrating the strangeness contribution to the spin structure function @xmath18 over the momentum fraction @xmath19 .",
    "the integral over the range in which data exists ( @xmath20 ) usually agrees with zero .",
    "for instance a recent hermes measurement in the region @xmath21 yields  @xcite @xmath22 .",
    "this means that non - zero results rely on extrapolations into the experimentally unprobed region of very small @xmath19 and are model dependent  @xcite . the standard hermes analysis  @xcite yields @xmath23 at a renormalization scale @xmath24gev@xmath25 in the @xmath26 scheme .",
    "our results below suggest , @xmath27 , unless there are large effects in the chiral extrapolation from a pseudoscalar mass @xmath28  mev to the physical point .    the scalar strangeness density is not directly accessible in experiment but plays a rle in models of nuclear structure .",
    "it is also of phenomenological interest since , assuming that heavy flavours are strongly suppressed , the dominant coupling of the higgs particle to the nucleon will be accompanied by this scalar matrix element .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : red ] we introduce our notation and explain the stochastic estimator and noise reduction methods applied . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discon ] we detail our lattice setup and employ these techniques to calculate disconnected quark loop contributions . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] we present our results on the axial and scalar nucleon strangeness matrix elements , before we conclude .",
    "the systematic tuning of the parameters used in the truncated solver method is described in detail in [ sec : app1 ] .",
    "the tsm is quite generally applicable .",
    "this is also demonstrated in the appendix where the conjugate gradient ( cg ) solver is replaced by the popular stabilized biconjugate gradient ( bicgstab2 ) solver  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results appeared in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "as outlined above we require propagators @xmath29 connecting arbitrary pairs of lattice points , where @xmath30 denotes a lattice dirac operator . in our specific case we employ the wilson quark action  @xcite .",
    "since the propagators have @xmath31 components , where @xmath32 denotes the number of lattice points , direct evaluation would be prohibitively expensive , both in terms of computer time and of memory .",
    "however , we encounter statistical errors anyway from the importance sampling of path integral expectation values .",
    "hence it is sufficient to aim at an ( unbiased ) estimate , which can be obtained by stochastic methods  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "we introduce the following notation , @xmath33 @xmath5 denotes the number of `` stochastic estimates '' .",
    "let @xmath34 , @xmath35 be random vectors with the properties , @xmath36 these requirements are for instance met by complex @xmath37 noise where the @xmath4 components are numbers @xmath38 , with the uncorrelated random phases @xmath39 . in @xcite",
    "it has been demonstrated that real and complex @xmath40 noise reduces the variance , relative to other choices such as gaussian or double hump noise . in our experience , similarly small variances can also be obtained with @xmath41 , @xmath42 or even with @xmath43 noisy sources  @xcite , indicating that the only important property is an equal modulus of the components . in the present study",
    "we employ complex @xmath40 noise , where the components of the random vectors @xmath34 run over the spacetime volume , spin and colour .",
    "we define the hermitian lattice dirac operator @xmath44 .",
    "if we solve the linear systems , @xmath45 for @xmath46 , then we can substitute , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : cancel ] ) , @xmath47 the difference between the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : set ] ) above and the exact result is unbiased and reduces like @xmath7 . the sparse linear system of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lin ] ) can for example be solved by means of the conjugate gradient ( cg ) or the stabilized biconjugate gradient ( bicgstab2 ) algorithms .",
    "note that in the cg case we can actually use even / odd preconditioning by employing the operator @xmath48 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath49 by multiplying the result with @xmath50 .",
    "the stochastic estimate approach reduces the problem from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , in terms of memory and computer time .",
    "the stochastic error will remain roughly constant if @xmath5 is scaled like @xmath53 with the lattice volume , where @xmath54 denotes the lattice spacing . in order to limit the computational effort ,",
    "@xmath5 should not be chosen overly large . however , in the end the stochastic noise should not be the dominant source of statistical error .",
    "in general , the optimal balance between the stochastic sampling on single configurations and the monte carlo importance sampling of gauge configurations will depend on the observable in question and on the methods used .    due to the difference between @xmath55 and @xmath56 above",
    ", any fermionic observable @xmath57 can only be estimated up to a stochastic error @xmath58 on a given configuration .",
    "we define the configuration average @xmath59 over @xmath60 uncorrelated configurations and normalize this appropriately : @xmath61 for large @xmath5 and @xmath60 this will scale like @xmath62 .",
    "we also define the total error @xmath63 as the variation of the obtained estimates of @xmath57 over gauge configurations . at fixed @xmath5",
    "this will be proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "obviously , this total error is limited by the stochastic error ( @xmath65 ) , a monte carlo error @xmath66 can be introduced . in the limit of large @xmath5 and @xmath60 ,",
    "the factorization @xmath67 holds , see e.g.  @xcite . for our considerations",
    "there is no need to introduce this quantity . ] : @xmath68 if @xmath69 then it is worthwhile to improve the quality of the estimates while if @xmath70 then precision can only be gained by increasing the number of configurations @xmath60 , possibly reducing @xmath5 to save computer time since the @xmath71 scaling cancels from the above inequality .    to minimize the stochastic noise at a given computational effort",
    ", we combine a multitude of techniques :    1 .   partitioning ( also known as the spin explicit method or as dilution )  @xcite , 2 .   the hopping parameter expansion ( hpe ) technique  @xcite , 3 .   the truncated solver method ( tsm )  @xcite and 4 .   the truncated eigenmode acceleration ( tea )  @xcite .",
    "these methods are explained below .",
    "we decompose @xmath72 into @xmath73 subspaces @xmath74 : @xmath75 . one can then set the source vectors @xmath76 to zero , outside of the subspace @xmath77 .",
    "we label the corresponding solutions as @xmath78 .",
    "the solution for the all - to - all propagator is then given by the sum , @xmath79 this procedure results in an @xmath73-fold increase in the total number of solver applications . the term @xmath80 multiplying @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : set ] ) only has off - diagonal entries , all of similar sizes .",
    "therefore the off - diagonal entries of @xmath56 will determine the stochastic error of the particular observables in question .",
    "@xmath56 will exponentially decay with the spacetime distance between source and sink : spacetime components in the neighbourhood of the sink position will yield the leading contributions to the stochastic variance .",
    "likewise the noise for spin components that are strongly coupled to each other by @xmath56 , multiplied by the relevant @xmath81 and derivative structures , will dominate .",
    "ideally , partitioning will black out the largest contributions to the stochastic noise .",
    "if the achieved reduction exceeds the @xmath82 factor , then the computational overhead is justified .",
    "this overhead can be somewhat reduced at the expense of memory by sophisticated preconditioning techniques and/or aggressive deflation  @xcite : the constant set - up costs of such techniques become more affordable with a larger number of right hand sides .",
    "we experimented with various patterns and combinations of colour , spin and time partitioning , see e.g.  @xcite . partitioning as a stand - alone solution works very well in many situations  @xcite .",
    "however , such gains are mostly eliminated once partitioning is combined with the other tricks .",
    "time partitioning is a notable exception : in situations where only timeslice - to - all propagators are required there is no increase in the number of solves but the variance is still reduced . in the calculation of disconnected contributions to the nucleon structure",
    "it also turns out to be useful to generate the current insertion at more than one timeslice , e.g.  to average the correlation with a nucleon propagating from a given source in the forward direction and the backward propagating one ( which comes for free ) . in this case",
    "one can seed the random sources at two ( or more ) well separated timeslices and still gain from partitioning , without any associated overhead .      the stochastic noise from terms that are close to the diagonal",
    "is accompanied by larger amplitudes than terms that are far off the diagonal , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : set ] ) and the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : part ] above",
    ". hence the cancellation of near - diagonal noise requires a comparatively larger number of estimates .",
    "the hpe aims at eliminating some of the near - diagonal noise contributions by exploiting the ultra - locality of the action .",
    "thus it can not be generalized for instance to the neuberger action  @xcite .",
    "we rewrite the fermionic matrix as , @xmath83 the hpe is based on the observation that one can expand , @xmath84 where @xmath85 . for distances between source and sink consisting of more than @xmath86 links , the first term on the right hand side does not contribute since @xmath87 only connects nearest spacetime neighbours .",
    "therefore , @xmath88_{xy}$ ] for sufficiently large source and sink separations .",
    "however , at finite @xmath5 , @xmath89\\}_{xy}\\neq \\{\\mathrm{e}[(\\kappa d)^km^{-1}]\\}_{xy } ( = \\{(\\kappa d)^k\\mathrm{e}[m^{-1}])\\}_{xy})$ ] , where the variance of the latter estimate of @xmath90 is reduced .",
    "this was for instance exploited in  @xcite . in some cases",
    "additional powers of @xmath87 can be gained due to the @xmath81 structure of the creation and annihilation operators .    here",
    "we study closed loops , i.e.  @xmath91 .",
    "obviously , only even powers of @xmath87 contribute to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 .",
    "we can write , @xmath94 , where the first term can be computed trivially . in the other cases , @xmath95 . for the wilson action , @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 otherwise .",
    "for the sheikholeslami - wohlert action  @xcite , @xmath99 .",
    "the lowest non - vanishing terms have been calculated analytically  @xcite and can be computed and corrected for exactly ( unbiased noise subtraction )  @xcite .",
    "we limit ourselves to the highest vanishing order ( @xmath98 or @xmath96 for the wilson action ) , where such subtraction is not necessary . in this case",
    "the computational overhead of the hpe is small , such that this substitution can easily be combined with the tsm that we explain below .",
    "it has been noticed long ago  @xcite that solvers typically converge to the correct result within an accuracy of the size of the stochastic error after a relatively small number of iterations .",
    "practitioners have therefore sometimes relaxed the requirement on the residual when solving for stochastic sources .",
    "this is not unproblematic since it introduces a systematic bias that will be invisible on one configuration but might very well affect the result obtained on a sample of , say , 200 configurations .",
    "we label the result obtained after @xmath100 solver iterations by @xmath101 , where omitting the subscript means convergence within numerical accuracy .",
    "we can now factorize : @xmath102 the above equation is an exact linear decomposition of @xmath56 and the algorithm used to calculate both parts is well defined . due to these properties and the fact that the @xmath34 with @xmath103 are uncorrelated with those for @xmath104 ,",
    "the resulting estimate is unbiased .",
    "ideally , one will generate a large number @xmath105 of relatively cheap estimates at small @xmath100 and then remove the bias by correcting with a small number @xmath106 of expensive solutions to machine precision .",
    "this method can easily be combined with all the other methods described here .",
    "it is possible to tune the two parameters @xmath107 and @xmath100 that enter the algorithm to the point of minimal variance at fixed computer time in a relatively inexpensive and straightforward way .",
    "this is discussed in [ sec : app1 ] .    in some sense",
    "the underlying philosophy of tsm is similar to estimating the cheap first term within the hpe eq .",
    "( [ eq : hpe2 ] ) with many random sources and the expensive second term with only a few sources .",
    "however , iterative solvers like the cg converge faster than the hpe . moreover , tsm is applicable to any fermion action , not only to ultra - local ones , and efficient for any quark mass .",
    "tsm can be combined with hpe , see sec .",
    "[ sec : combine ] below .    to check our implementation of the method we compared the exact result for @xmath108 , where @xmath109 denotes the spin and colour indices , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 , with an estimate obtained from eq .",
    "( [ trunc ] ) .",
    "we indeed find consistency within errors for different @xmath100 , @xmath113 and @xmath106 .",
    "for example , for @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120=(0.0300(7),-0.0014(7))$ ] , compared to the exact result of @xmath121 .",
    "in [ sec : app1 ] we also demonstrate that the tsm can be generalized to other solvers , by employing bicgstab2 .",
    "however , the smooth convergence of cg , that is relatively independent of the random source and gauge configuration , is a clear advantage when it comes to deciding on a tsm parameter set .",
    "moreover , in the cg case the combination with the truncated eigenmode acceleration bears less computational overhead and is compatible with even - odd preconditioning ( see below ) .",
    "we emphasize however that the converged solutions @xmath46 within eq .",
    "( [ trunc ] ) can be obtained by using any efficient solver . in particular , there is no need to employ the same solver as that used for obtaining the truncated solutions @xmath122 .",
    "the truncated solver of course needs to be the same for @xmath104 as that used for @xmath103 .",
    "we define the @xmath123 smallest ( real ) eigenvalues @xmath124 of @xmath50 and the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath125 , @xmath126 : @xmath127 these can for instance be calculated by means of the parallel implicitly restarted arnoldi method ( iram ) with chebychev acceleration  @xcite or by ritz methods  @xcite .",
    "we can now approximate  @xcite , @xmath128 however , this estimate is biased .",
    "we define the projection operator @xmath129 , onto the complement of the space spanned by these @xmath123 eigenvectors , @xmath130 projecting the stochastic sources onto the orthogonal complement , @xmath131 yields the new unbiased estimate  @xcite , @xmath132 where a left projection of @xmath133 is not necessary since @xmath134=0 $ ] and thus @xmath135 .",
    "the above estimate will usually have a reduced variance .",
    "note that in the literature exact point - to - all propagators have also been combined with a truncated low eigenmode all - to - all calculation to achieve smaller gauge errors ( low mode averaging )  @xcite .    a nice side effect of tea lies in the acceleration of the solver , by deflation  @xcite .",
    "the condition number of the projected operator @xmath136 and therefore the number of solver iterations are reduced . within some algorithms like the cg",
    "the fact that the projector commutes with the operator @xmath50 guarantees that the krylov subspace remains confined within the orthogonal complement . so in these cases",
    "no further intermediate projections are necessary to fully exploit the potential of deflation .",
    "note that while the number of undeflated solver iterations increases like @xmath137 at small quark masses , the efficiency of the eigenvalue calculation remains the same .",
    "unfortunately , at small @xmath138 , one would like to increase the linear lattice extent @xmath139 . in this case",
    ", the rank of the deflation space in the worst case will increase like @xmath140 . depending on the volume required this may or may not become a serious problem .",
    "the volume scaling of stochastic methods is somewhat more favourable : the number of estimates needs to be adjusted at most like @xmath53 ( this can be somewhat reduced by partitioning ) . from these considerations",
    "it becomes evident that the optimal choices of @xmath123 and @xmath5 strongly depend on the volume , the quark mass and the lattice spacing .",
    "the same holds for the algorithm where a deflated cg can outperform a ( deflated ) bicgstab2 , in particular when combined with the truncated solver method .",
    "obviously , it is also possible to decompose @xmath30 , rather than the hermitian operator @xmath44 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tea1 ] ) , into eigenmodes  @xcite : @xmath141 . however , in this case we end up with a biorthonormal system @xmath142 , where the left eigenvectors @xmath143 will differ from the right eigenvectors : @xmath144 .",
    "one can now decompose , @xmath145 it can easily be seen that due to the property @xmath146 , @xmath147 is an eigenvalue whenever @xmath148 is an eigenvalue , with a left eigenvector @xmath149 and a right eigenvector @xmath150 .",
    "the advantage of this decomposition is that the eigenvectors are independent of the quark mass and the eigenvalues at different @xmath151 values are trivially related to each other .",
    "this follows from the structure eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappad ] ) . in this article",
    "we will not pursue this alternative eigenmode decomposition any further .",
    "however , the decomposition of @xmath29 might converge better in some channels than that of @xmath56 and vice versa . while this biorthogonal approach is incompatible with deflating the cg solver , it would be the natural starting point for bicg solvers .",
    "partitioning can trivially be combined with the other three methods .",
    "however some notes are in place with respect to combinations of hpe , tsm and tea . within the hpe",
    "a left - multiplication of the estimate @xmath152 $ ] with @xmath153 is essential since we have defined @xmath154 .",
    "a right - multiplication would involve @xmath155 .",
    "the easiest way of implementing hpe is to multiply the solution vectors with @xmath156 , prior to any application of smearing functions or contractions but after tea and tsm .    within eq .",
    "( [ eq : tea ] ) only the projected source vectors appear .",
    "hence after the projection , eq .  ( [ eq : pro ] ) , @xmath157 the original noise vectors @xmath34 can be discarded .",
    "the overhead from the projection can be significant when combined with the tsm , eq .",
    "( [ trunc ] ) , where the large number of estimates @xmath113 implies a large number of projections and the small number of solver iterations @xmath100 indicates that not much computer time will be spent between these projections .",
    "the projection overhead can be reduced by restricting the computation of the inner products to the partitioning subspace : many components of @xmath34 might have been set to zero if the partitioning method was used .",
    "this saving can not be obtained at the sink .",

    "obviously the residual will not be small for the truncated solutions , which therefore one would wish to project back into the orthogonal complement ( before application of the @xmath87 operator within the hpe ) .",
    "fortunately , the ( even - odd preconditioned ) cg algorithm never leaves the orthogonal subspace : in this case , such an additional projection is never necessary , even if the solver is not run to convergence .",
    "neither is such a left projection strictly required for solvers without this property , as long as the precision of the part that is run to convergence is sufficiently large . in this case",
    ", the @xmath113 biased estimates will pick up some unwanted low mode contributions that will however be corrected for by the @xmath106 estimates of the bias .",

    "for completeness we mention that domain decomposition techniques have been suggested in the literature  @xcite .",
    "these can easily be combined with tsm and tea too , as can the so - called one - end - trick  @xcite .",
