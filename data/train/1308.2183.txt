    "we study a model of mass redistribution on a finite graph .",
    "a  vertex @xmath0 of the graph holds mass @xmath1 at time @xmath2 . when a `` meteor hits '' @xmath0 at time @xmath2 , the mass @xmath3 of the soil present at @xmath0 is distributed equally among all neighbors of @xmath0 ( added to their masses ) .",
    "there is no soil ( mass ) left at @xmath0 just after a meteor hit .",
    "meteor hits are modeled as independent poisson processes , one for each vertex of the graph .",
    "we will address the following questions about the meteor model .",
    "does the process converge to equilibrium ?",
    "if so , at what rate ? assuming that the mass distribution process is in equilibrium , what is the distribution of `` meteor craters '' ( sites with zero mass ) at a fixed time ? in equilibrium , at a fixed time and vertex , what is the distribution of soil mass ?",
    "we will answer some of these questions in the asymptotic sense , for some families of growing graphs .",
    "we will also study an `` earthworm model '' in which the soil redistribution events do not occur according to the poisson arrival process but along the trajectory of a symmetric random walk on the graph .",
    "see section  [ earth ] for the motivation of the `` earthworm '' model .",
    "we will now present sources of inspiration , motivation and possible applications for our main model .",
    "similar models of mass redistribution appeared in @xcite , but that paper went in a completely different direction .",
    "it was mostly focused on the limit model when the graph approximates the real line .",
    "continuous mass redistribution also appeared in a version of the chip - firing model in @xcite , but the updating mechanism in that paper is different from ours .",
    "mass redistribution is a part of every sandpile model , including a `` continuous '' version studied in @xcite .",
    "sandpile models have considerably different structures and associated questions from ours .",
    "our model is one of the simplest models for mass redistribution .",
    "therefore , its analysis is likely to be most complete on the mathematical side  a program that we only start in this paper .",
    "the elementary character of our model makes it amenable to a variety of mathematical techniques  something that we demonstrate in this article .",
    "our model can be easily modified and generalized to accommodate the needs of applied science .",
    "more on the theoretical side , our model is related to products of random matrices .",
    "let @xmath4 be a finite graph with a set of vertices @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the transpose of the transition probability matrix of the nearest neighbor simple random walk on this graph , and let @xmath7 be the diagonal ( identity ) matrix .",
    "for every @xmath8 , let @xmath9 be the matrix obtained from @xmath10 by zeroing out all but the @xmath11th column , and let @xmath12 .",
    "consider this collection of matrices @xmath13 .",
    "suppose we generate a sequence of i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath14 with the uniform distribution in @xmath15 and consider the sequence of products of i.i.d .",
    "matrices @xmath16 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath17 is the @xmath0th coordinate of the product of a finite sequence of matrices @xmath18 right - multiplied with the column vector @xmath19 .",
    "does the product @xmath16 have a limit in some sense as @xmath20 tends to infinity ? products of i.i.d .",
    "random matrices have been an old and fascinating subject ( see @xcite ) , and several conditions are known for convergence of distributions of the products .",
    "there are also a number of theorems on the limit distribution . however , the particular class of products considered here is just beyond the assumptions under which general results are known to hold .",
    "most of the entries in any @xmath21 are zero , violating assumptions in @xcite , equation  ( 3.1 ) , and these matrices are not strong contractions in the sense of @xcite , theorem  1.1 . however , as we will show , the additional graph structure in the background determines the limit and the rate of convergence of the products @xmath16 .",
    "a more recent line of investigation related to our work is on markov chains on the space of partitions ; see @xcite .",
    "one of the important considerations in this regard is the product of i.i.d .",
    "picks from a probability measure on the space of finite probability transition matrices .",
    "that is , @xmath22 are i.i.d .",
    "stochastic matrices , and one is interested in the _ backward _ product @xmath23 .",
    "the knowledge of this limit determines the behavior of a corresponding markov chain on the space of finite partitions of @xmath24 ; see @xcite , equation ( 5 ) and theorem  1.2 .",
    "the transpose of each @xmath21 is a stochastic matrix .",
    "if we define @xmath25 , then @xmath26 is the transpose of @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the limits described in this work give explicit information about certain markov chains on the space of partitions .",
    "in the title of this paper , wimps stands for `` weakly interacting mathematical particles . ''",
    "it turns out that one of the main technical tools in this paper is a pair of `` weakly interacting '' continuous time symmetric random walks on the graph .",
    "if the two random walks are at different vertices , they move independently .",
    "however , if they are at the same vertex , their next jumps occur at the same time , after an exponential waiting time , common to both processes .",
    "the dependence ends here  the two processes jump to vertices chosen independently , even though they jump at the same time .",
    "heuristically , one expects wimps to behave very much like independent continuous time random walks . showing this is the heart of a number of arguments but it proves to be harder than one would expect . in other cases ,",
    "the slight dependence manifests itself clearly and generates phenomena that otherwise would be trivial .",
    "wimps played an important role in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ secpre ] contains rigorous definitions of the meteor process and wimps .",
    "section  [ secconv ] is devoted to basic properties of the meteor process and convergence to equilibrium .",
    "we present three theorems on convergence .",
    "the first one is very abstract and does not provide any useful information on the rate of convergence .",
    "the second one provides a rate of convergence , but since it applies to all meteor processes , it is not optimal in specific examples .",
    "the third theorem is limited to tori and gives a sharp estimate for the convergence rate .",
    "section  [ craters ] is devoted to the distribution of craters in circular graphs and is the most combinatorial of all the sections  it is partly based on results from @xcite .",
    "we address several questions about craters .",
    "the first one is concerned with the probability of a given pattern of craters .",
    "the second question is about fluctuations of the numbers of patterns around the mean .",
    "we do not provide a standard large deviations result , but we prove a theorem on the most likely configuration of craters assuming that there are very few of them .",
    "section  [ secmass ] presents results on the mass distribution at a single vertex or a family of vertices , in case of circular graphs .",
    "section  [ secnonc ] contains theorems on the mass distribution for noncircular graphs .",
    "the first result is a bound for the variance for a large class of graphs .",
    "the second result is a completely explicit limiting distribution at a vertex , for the complete graphs , when the size of the graph grows to infinity .",
    "finally , section  [ earth ] contains the proof of the claim that the earthworm distributes mass in a torus more or less evenly , on a large scale .",
    "the following setup and notation will be used in most of the paper .",
    "all constants will be assumed to be strictly positive , finite , real numbers , unless stated otherwise .",

    "we assume that processes @xmath43 are jointly independent .",
    "a vertex @xmath33 holds some `` soil '' with mass equal to @xmath44 at time @xmath45 .",

    "this behavior is the same as that of two independent random walks .",
