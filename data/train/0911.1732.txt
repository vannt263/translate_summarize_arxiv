    "ngc604 is a giant hii region ( ghr ) located in an outer spiral arm of m33 , at a distance of 840 kpc .",
    "it is the second most luminous hii region in the local group , after 30 doradus in the lmc .",
    "both are nearby examples of giant star - forming regions whose individual objects can be spatially resolve for further study .",
    "ngc604 has been the target of many studies during the past few decades .",
    "a brief summary of known facts about ngc604 includes the following .",
    "this ghr is ionized by a massive , young cluster , with at least 200 o stars ( some as early as o3-o4 ) .",
    "the cluster does not exhibit a central core distribution .",
    "instead , the stars are widely spread over its projected area in a structure called scaled ob association ( soba ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "wolf - rayet stars , a confirmed and many candidate red supergiant stars , a luminous blue variable and a supernova remnant are all part of ngc604 s stellar population ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the age of the central ionizing cluster has been determined by different authors as between 3 and 5 myr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . + the interestellar medium reveals a complex structure with a high - excitation central region ( made up of multiple two - dimensional structures ) , asymmetrically surrounded by a low - excitation halo .",
    "the whole region shows a very complex geometry of cavities , expanding shells and filaments , as well as dense molecular regions .",
    "all of these structures show different kinematic behaviour ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "+ aiming to characterize the youngest stellar population and its environment , we performed near - infrared ( nir ) photometry ( _ jhk _ ) and analysed narrow - band images in pa@xmath0 , br@xmath1 and h@xmath2(2 - 1 ) .",
    "taking into account that nir observations are less affected by dust extinction characteristic in star - fomation environments , we can take a deep dive into ngc604 to study those very young objects which are still immersed in their parental clouds at the sites of current star formation .",
    "the images were obtained with the near infrared imager and spectrometer ( niri ) at _ gemini north_. the resulting plate scale is 0.117 arcsecpixel@xmath3 , with a field of view of 120 @xmath4 120 arcsec@xmath5 . the filters used and their main characteristics are listed in table 1 .",
    ".main characteristics of broad - band and narrow - band filters used in our gemini / niri observations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the images were taken under excellent seeing conditions , on average @xmath6 in the j , h , and k@xmath7 images .",
    "a set of approximately 10 individual exposures was taken in each band to combine into the final image .",
    "data reduction and processing were performed with specific tasks using the gemini - niri iraf package .",
    "images were sky subtracted and flat fielded and short darks exposures were used to identify bad pixels .",
    "stellar magnitudes were obtained by point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting in crowded fields using daophot software ( stetson 1987 ) in iraf .",
    "although a standard procedure , psf construction and fitting involves an iterative and careful process in which several tries were made to get the best results .",
    "the effective area covered by our photometry is @xmath8 107 @xmath4 107 arcsec@xmath5 ( @xmath8 430 @xmath4 430 pc@xmath5 at the distance of m33 ) .",
    "the average photometric errors are 0.09 , 0.11 and 0.21 mags in the h , j and k@xmath7 filters , respectivelly , and the completeness limits are 22 mags in j and 21 mags in h and k@xmath7 .",
    "magnitudes in the individual filters were matched in a unique list containing 5566 objects in the field in which all three j , h and k@xmath7 magnitudes were measured .",
    "astrometry was derived using 35 objects in common in our field of ngc604 and the gsc - ii catalog , version 2.3.2 ( 2006 ) in the icrs , equinox j2000.0 .",

    "we have included @xmath8 2000 selected objects , located within a radius of 48 arcsec ( @xmath8 200 pc ) and centered on ngc604 , meeting a certain photometric quality level ( magnitude error @xmath10 median(error)+ 1.0 @xmath4 standard deviation(error ) ) .",
    "red symbols in both plots are objects that lie on the right side of the reddening line for a o6-o8 v star.for each of these objects , the error in ( h - k@xmath7 ) color is smaller than its distance to the reddening line , so that we can ensure that they undoubtedly show an ir excess . + among the objects with intrinsic ir excesses in ghrs we expect to find wolf - rayet stars , early supergiants and of stars , and massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) .",
    "many of these types of objects ( or candidates ) have already been found in ngc604 . based on our deep _",
    "photometry we found a total of 164 objects that show ir excesses .",
    "as can be expected , @xmath8 70% of these lie in a small area near the region s center and a large proportion are tightly grouped in regions coincident with the radio - continuum peaks at 8.4 ghz from @xcite , as shown in figure 3 ( left panel ) .",
    "these results are in complete agreement with the analysis of @xcite based on hst / nicmos nir images , where myso candidates also appeared aligned with the radio peak structures .",
    "+ what we found supports the idea mentioned by many authors , that those areas may be embedded star - forming regions , also taking into account that regions coincident with the radio knots show conditions of high temperature and density ( @xcite ) , and in two of them @xcite identified compact hii regions .",
    "most objects with ir excesses will be the targets for further observing programs ( making use of the integral - field spectroscopic facilities at _ gemini north _ ) to elucidate their nature and derive accurate properties by means of spectroscopic study . also , those objects that are located at the bright , massive end on the cm diagram deserve further observation and study .",
    "+ on the basis of our narrow - band images we generated an extinction map , derived from the observed variations of the br@xmath1 to h@xmath9 ratio ( with the h@xmath9 image taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the color scale used in the map shows regions with higher extinction in red / white .",
    "the present and future results of our nir study will be placed in the context of previous studies of ngc604 to complete the picture of the overall formation and evolution scenario of this ghr . + * acknowledgements * + rb acknowledges partial support from the universidad de la serena , project diuls cd08102 ."
