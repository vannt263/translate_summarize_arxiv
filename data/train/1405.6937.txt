    "neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath2 ) decay is a crucial process in particle physics since it provides the only experimentally viable method to ascertain the majorana nature of neutrino , performing in the meantime a sensitive test of the lepton number conservation .",
    "in addition , it has the potential to establish the absolute neutrino mass scale and to give information about the hierarchy of the neutrino masses  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "one of the main objectives of next - generation @xmath3 decay experiments is to explore the inverted hierarchy region of the neutrino mass pattern .",
    "this implies reaching a lifetime sensitivity of the order of @xmath4 years , which requires a background level close to zero in the ton@xmath5year exposure range .    a powerful technology to achieve this outstanding performance is represented by scintillating bolometers , used to study isotopes with a @xmath2 q - value definitely higher than 2.6  mev , and therefore free from the @xmath6 background induced by natural radioactivity .",
    "in these devices , the dominant background is expected to be given by energy - degraded @xmath7 particles , which however can be rejected thanks to the different scintillation - to - heat ratio between @xmath7 and @xmath8 particles  @xcite .",
    "the lumineu project  @xcite ( luminescent underground molybdenum investigation for neutrino mass and nature ) aims at developing scintillating bolometers based on zinc molybdate ( znmoo@xmath1 ) crystals to study the isotope @xmath0mo ( q - value=3034  kev @xcite ) , capable reaching the performance required to explore the inverted hierarchy region , as shown for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite and susbsequently confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite . a crytical step in the lumineu path",
    "is represented by the growth of high - quality radio - pure large - mass ( 300  500 g ) znmoo@xmath1 monocrystals .",
    "as far as non - isotopically enriched material is concerned , the required crystallization technology for a sensitive @xmath3 decay experiment has been established , and individual detectors  prefiguring the single modules of future large arrays  have already shown to be able to reach the desired bolometric performance and intrinsic radiopurity levels  @xcite .    however , the crucial step of reproducing these excellent preliminary results with enriched molybdenum ( highly desirable operation for a future large - scale experiment , the @xmath0mo natural abundance being only 9.7% @xcite ) is not trivial for two main reasons .",
    "on one hand , the initial chemical and radioactive purity levels of enriched samples , normally poorer than those characterizing natural material , may conflict with the construction of well performing bolometric detectors .",
    "this problem was observed for instance in teo@xmath9 bolometers  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "enriched material is very expensive and its procurement represents the highest cost factor in future searches .",
    "therefore , the purification / crystallization chain must imply negligible irrecoverable losses of the @xmath2 decay candidate isotope .",
    "this strong requirement is not a priori compatible with all the purification and crystal - growth technologies . in this letter",
    ", we show for the first time that both potential obstacles are actually overcome in the znmoo@xmath1 case , adding a further essential element in favor of the use of the lumineu technology for future @xmath2 decay searches .",
    "molybdenum enriched in the isotope @xmath0mo up to 99.5% was used to develop zinc molybdate crystals .",
    "the enriched molybdenum was produced at the kurchatov institute in the eighties of the last century ( former soviet union ) .",
    "approximately one kilogram of the material in form of metal , belonging to the insitute for nuclear research ( kyiv , ukraine ) and now available for the lumineu program , was utilized in an experiment at the modane underground laboratory ( france ) to search for double beta decay of @xmath0mo to excited states of @xmath0ru @xcite . afterwards , in order to improve its purity level , the metallic sample of enriched @xmath0mo was dissolved in 20% ultrapure nitric acid and transformed into molybdenum acid ( @xmath0moo@xmath10h@xmath9o ) . after rinsing the compound by nitric acid solution and annealing , a sample of 1199 g of purified molybdenum oxide ( @xmath0moo@xmath11 ) was obtained and used in the armonia experiment @xcite .",
    "the purification procedure has effectively removed the pollution in @xmath12k and @xmath13cs by one order of magnitude .",
    "the concentrations of thorium and radium were also decreased by factors 2 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the following radioactive contamination of the @xmath0moo@xmath11 sample can be derived from the data of the experiment ( in mbq / kg ) : 2.0(2 ) for @xmath14ra ( @xmath15u chain ) , 0.8(1 ) for @xmath16th ( @xmath17th chain ) , 5.9(1 ) for @xmath13cs , and 36(2 ) for @xmath12k @xcite .",
    "the level of impurities in the @xmath0moo@xmath11 was also measured by inductively coupled plasma mass - spectrometry ( icp - ms ) and atomic absorption spectroscopy ( aas ) methods .",
    "the results of these measurements , presented in table [ 100mo - cont ] , as well as radioactive contamination of the sample , suggest that the material should be additionally purified to be used for crystal scintillator production .",
    "for example , the concentration of the isotope @xmath16th in znmoo@xmath1 crystals to be used in future @xmath3 decay searches must not be higher than 10  @xmath18bq / kg in order to approach the requested zero background conditions mentioned in the introduction  @xcite .",
    ".contamination of @xmath0moo@xmath11 measured by inductively coupled plasma mass - spectrometry ( icp - ms ) and atomic absorption spectroscopy ( aas ) methods .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : perf ]    the optimum filter procedure  @xcite , typically used for the analysis of bolometric data , was applied to extract the amplitudes of each recorded signal .",
    "the calibration of the ld was performed by using a weak @xmath19fe source .",
    "the energy resolution ( fwhm ) of the ld at 5.9 kev of @xmath19fe was 0.42(2 ) kev at 13.7 mk and 0.57(4 ) kev at 19 mk .",
    "the energy scale of the zn@xmath0moo@xmath1 bolometers was determined by means of a low - activity @xmath17th source and @xmath6 quanta from natural radioactivity ( mainly @xmath14ra daughters ) .",
    "the energy spectra accumulated by the zn@xmath0moo@xmath1 detectors operated at 13.7 mk are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] . the energy resolution for the detectors at 2614.5 kev of @xmath20tl was fwhm = 11(3 ) kev for the zn@xmath0moo@xmath1-top and fwhm = 15(3 ) kev for the zn@xmath0moo@xmath1-bottom in the measurements at 13.7 mk .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : bg ] , the 2614.5 kev peaks have quite low statistics due to the small mass of the crystals and the short duration of the measurements .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to estimate the resolution of the detectors for the more intensive @xmath6 lines presented in the spectra below 1 mev .",
    "for example , the fwhm at 609.3 kev peak of @xmath21bi was measured as 5.0(5 ) kev and 10(1 ) kev for the zn@xmath0moo@xmath1 top and bottom , respectively . experience with large - mass slow bolometric detectors shows that the energy resolution on the @xmath6 lines is significantly worsened by pulse pile - up .",
    "we expect therefore that the energy resolution in an underground set - up is much closer to the fwhm baseline width and definitely better than 10  kev , as already observed in underground - operated natural znmoo@xmath1 bolometers  @xcite .",
    "moo@xmath1 scintillating bolometers ( top and bottom ) mounted in one holder .",
    "the detector was operated at 13.7 mk and irradiated by low - active @xmath17th source and environmental @xmath6s .",
    "the energy of @xmath6 peaks are in kev.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    moo@xmath1-top during 18.3 h of calibration measurements .",
    "the band populated by @xmath22 events ( below 2.6 mev ) and cosmic muons is clearly visible.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    plots reporting the light - to - heat signal amplitude ratio as a function of the heat signal amplitude for the data accumulated over 18.3 h in the aboveground set - up with the enriched zn@xmath0moo@xmath1 detectors are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] .    the data allow estimating the light yield ( the amount of detected light energy per particle energy measured by the deposited heat ) related to @xmath22 events ( ly@xmath23 ) .",
    "for instance , the distribution of the ly@xmath23 versus the detected heat accumulated by the zn@xmath0moo@xmath1-top scintillating bolometer is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ly ] .",
    "the ly@xmath23 was estimated by fitting the data in a 6002700 kev interval .",
    "the fit gives similar values for all working temperatures : e.g. 1.01(11 ) kev / mev ( at 13.7 mk ) and 1.02(11 ) kev / mev ( at 19 mk ) for the crystal zn@xmath0moo@xmath1-top , and 0.93(11 ) kev / mev ( at 13.7 mk ) and 0.99(12 ) kev / mev ( at 19 mk ) for the crystal zn@xmath0moo@xmath1-bottom .",
    "moo@xmath1-top ( a ) and zn@xmath0moo@xmath1-bottom ( b ) crystals . the data were accumulated at 13.7 mk .",
    "the events above 2.6 mev in the @xmath22 region are caused by cosmic muons .",
    "the position of the @xmath7 events related to @xmath24po is slightly shifted from the nominal value of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 5.4 mev ) due to a different heat response for @xmath7 particles , already observed in this type of detectors  @xcite . the mean value and three @xmath27 intervals for ly@xmath23 are shown by solid red lines.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in spite of the short duration of the measurements and the aboveground conditions , the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ly ] demonstrate an encouraging internal radiopurity level of the tested zn@xmath0moo@xmath1 crystals .",
    "there are no remarkable accumulation of counts in the region where events caused by @xmath7 radionuclides from the u / th chains are expected .",
    "particles ( @xmath26 0.120.18 ) derived in measurements with znmoo@xmath1-based bolometers  @xcite , we consider all the events with energy in the range 49 mev and light yield below 0.2 kev / mev as related to potential @xmath7 contaminants . ]",
    "a weak event cluster probably related to @xmath24po is used to determine the activity of this radionuclide , considering a 200 kev interval around its centroid .",
    "the analysis of the data accumulated at 13.7 mk and 19 mk with the zn@xmath0moo@xmath1-top and zn@xmath0moo@xmath1-bottom bolometers gives an activity of @xmath24po in the crystals at the level of 1.1(3 ) mbq / kg and 1.2(3 ) mbq / kg , respectively .",
    "these activities are similar to those measured precisely in natural znmoo@xmath1 bolometers  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the current statistics of the @xmath24po counts ( 46 events depending on the set of measurements ) is not enough to get precise value of the activities and to distinguish a bulk contamination of @xmath24po ( or of the progenitor @xmath24pb ) from surface pollution .",
    "the radiopurity of the zn@xmath0moo@xmath1 crystals will be precisely determined in next measurements in underground conditions , but the absence of significant @xmath7 peaks at this level indicates that the contamination of the harmful nuclides @xmath16th and @xmath21bi  @xcite does not exceed a level of a few mbq / kg .",
    "another important consideration regards the good reproducibility of the behaviour of the two detectors .",
    "the slight differences in the operational parameters of the two devices are well within the typical spread observed in this type of detectors . both detectors , despite some difference in the optical quality , have shown practically identical bolometric and scintillation characteristics .",
    "a zinc molybdate crystal with a mass of 171 g was produced from molybdenum enriched in @xmath0mo to 99.5% in the framework of the lumineu program , after a complex and effective purification method .",
    "the output of the crystal boule is 84% , which demonstrates an important advantage of the low - thermal - gradient czochralski technique for crystal growing .",
    "the irrecoverable losses of enriched molybdenum were found to be of the order of a few % .",
    "the results on the scintillating bolometers fabricated with two enriched crystals obtained from the boule show that the response of these devices meets the requirements of a high - sensitivity double beta decay search and is not distinguishable from the one observed in recent measurements performed with non - enriched detectors @xcite .",
    "encouraging , although preliminary , results were also obtained in terms of radiopurity .",
    "one can therefore expect a successful operation of scintillating bolometers based on enriched zn@xmath0moo@xmath1 crystals in an underground environment .",
    "this measurement is presently under preparation .",
    "recently , significant improvements in the growth technology developed at niic ( novosibirsk , russia ) have enabled the synthesis of large regular - shape cylindrical ( @xmath285@xmath54  cm ) natural znmoo@xmath1 crystals . by using an amount of enriched material larger than that employed in the experiment here described , moo@xmath1 scintillating bolometers . ]",
    "we foresee to develop zn@xmath0moo@xmath1 single detectors with masses in the 300  500 g range in the near future .",
    "the size of these devices corresponds to the one envisaged for the single module of large arrays of zn@xmath0moo@xmath1 detectors to search for @xmath3 decay of @xmath0mo  @xcite .",
    "the currently available enriched material will allow developing an array with a total mass of @xmath29  kg , corresponding to a sensitivity to the effective majorana mass in the range 0.05  0.15 ev  @xcite and capable therefore to approach the inverted hierarchy region of the neutrino mass pattern .",
    "the development of zn@xmath0moo@xmath1 scintillating bolometers is an essential part of the lumineu program , receiving funds from the agence nationale de la recherche ( france ) .",
    "the work was supported partly by the project `` cryogenic detectors to search for neutrinoless double beta decay of molybdenum '' in the framework of the programme `` dnipro '' based on ukraine - france agreement on cultural , scientific and technological cooperation .",
