    "a configuration is denoted as @xmath10 which means @xmath11 , where",
    "@xmath12 stands for the set of lattice points and the cardinality of @xmath12 is @xmath13 .",

    "the first line of eq . follows the usual convention in the field theoretical study of boson systems and the second line is introduced to save memories in actual simulations . for a later purpose , we introduce a model dependent function @xmath29 , where @xmath30 takes 1 ( 0 ) if @xmath31 is nonzero ( zero ) .",
    "the meaning of @xmath30 is straightforward ; we have only to consider the dynamics with nonzero transition rate .",
    "the algorithm starts by selecting one of @xmath21-tuples at any site , randomly .",
    "the simplest way to implement the selection is as follows : first a site @xmath9 is picked up with probability @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of accessible states ( nas ) at site @xmath9 and @xmath34 is the total number of accessible states ( tnas ) .",
    "then , @xmath21 is chosen with probability @xmath35 . in this procedure , the array of the number of particles at all sites , say @xmath36 $ ] ( @xmath37 = \\rho_{{\\bf{x}}}$ ] ) , is necessary .",
    "however , it is not efficient as there are too many floating number calculations . for a faster performance",
    "we introduce two more arrays , say list [  ] and act [  ] [  ] . the array list",
    "[  ] refers to the location of any @xmath21-tuple .",

    "this value is compatible with the numerical estimation in ref .",
    "@xcite .    by the same token",

    "can be derived in case each reaction involves at most two particles .",
    "since the reaction of boson annihilation model requires two particles , one can write down langevin equation which reads ( it interpretation is employed ) @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a complex stochastic random variable whose average is the mean number of particles at site @xmath108 , @xmath109 is the lattice laplacian defined as @xmath110 , @xmath111 is the imaginary number , and @xmath112 is a wiener process with @xmath113 .",

    "[ fig : aa_mc_l ] , numerical integration results for @xmath95 are shown with comparison to mc simulations . within statistical error , these two approaches yield the same results .",
    "since the deviation from the mean field solution is evident , langevin equation in the observation time properly appreciates the effect of noise .",
    "hence , we believe that fig . [ fig : aa_mc_l ] shows the equivalence of two approaches for the annihilation model .",
    "needless to say , the numerical integration of langevin equation is a much harder job than the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the absorbing phase transition has been extensively studied as a prototype of the nonequilibrium critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the rg based on the boson systems has been applied successfully especially to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class .",
    "recently , the particle number probability distribution for boson models belonging to the dp class was studied numerically and the rg prediction was confirmed again @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) defies any numerical and analytical conclusions to date @xcite .",
    "although the driven pcpd ( dpcpd ) studied in ref .",
    "@xcite seems to conclude that the pcpd forms a different universality class from the dp , recent extensive numerical study @xcite revives the scenario that the pcpd will eventually be found to belong to the dp class with a huge corrections to scaling .",
    "still , the universality classification for the one dimensional pcpd is yet to be settled unambiguously .    to make matters worse",
    ", the recent rg study shows that the field theory starting from the single species master equation is not viable @xcite , which was also anticipated independently in ref . @xcite .",
    "as both works conclude , the field theory should account for the multispecies nature of the pcpd properly .",
    "following this instruction , multi component langevin equations with real random variables are introduced and studied in ref .",
    "@xcite to find a viable field theory for the pcpd .",
    "we will take a slightly different path and ask whether we can find a viable field theory for the pcpd , in this section .",
    "since the pcpd involves two independent `` excitations '' such as particles and pairs , it is natural to generalize to a two species model which captures the main physics of the pcpd .",
    "this type of two species model with hard core particles was introduced and studied in ref .",
    "this section introduces a bosonic variant and studies it using both mc simulations and langevin equations .    the model which will be called the cyclically coupled ( cc ) model",
    "is defined as follows : there are two species , say @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "each species diffuses with rate @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "each @xmath118 particle is annihilated ( @xmath121 ) with rate @xmath122 , branches another @xmath118 particle ( @xmath123 ) with rate @xmath124 , and mutates into two @xmath117 particles ( @xmath125 ) with rate @xmath126 .",
    "every pair of @xmath118 particles at the same site can be coagulated ( @xmath127 ) with rate @xmath86 .",
    "every pair of @xmath117 particles produces a @xmath118 particle and is removed ( @xmath128 ) with rate @xmath129 .",
    "the @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) particles have a connection , if not a exact mapping , to the isolated particles ( pairs ) in the pcpd .    since the pcpd as well as the cc suffers from the strong corrections to scaling , it is nontrivial to show directly by mc simulations that the cc and the pcpd should belong to the same universality class .",
    "fortunately , we have an alternative to check the equivalence of the cc and the pcpd in the sense of the universality .",
    "if the relative bias between two species in the cc in one dimension triggers the mean field scaling with logarithmic corrections as happens in the dpcpd @xcite , it is reasonable to conclude that the cc and the pcpd share the critical behavior .",
    "the transition events of the cc with a relative bias in one dimension are almost same as those of the cc above except that @xmath117 particles hop only to the right with rate @xmath130 . for a numerical study , we set @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 with a tuning parameter @xmath74 .",
    "since only @xmath117 particles diffuse in a biased manner , the relative bias between different species can not be gauged away by the galilean transformation .",
    "figure [ fig : cc_bias ] shows that @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) which is a ratio of two densities at time @xmath17 behaves logarithmically at criticality . combining with the observation that @xmath138 at criticality with possible logarithmic corrections ( not shown ) , the cc with the bias shows the same critical behavior as the dpcpd , which confirms the equivalence of the cc to the pcpd in the sense of the universality .",

    "the system size for the numerical integration is @xmath116 and around 50 samples are independently generated with @xmath115 .",

    "are equivalent to the cc with / without bias .",
    "although we compared two approaches just for one set of parameter values , the full equivalence for all parameter values is still expected .    in summary",

    "then , we found langevin equations which are equivalent to the cc . from these two observation , we can say that langevin equations with complex random variables @xmath154 and @xmath155 show the same critical behavior as the pcpd .",
    "although we found the representative langevin equations for the pcpd , it is not obvious whether these equations with naive continuum limit can serve as a properly coarse - grained field theory for the pcpd . besides , we are not sure whether eqs .",
    "contain all relevant ( or sometimes dangerously irrelevant ) terms .",
    "for example , the reaction @xmath156 which is absent in our model can be generated by a chain of reactions .",
