    "the development of quantum information theory and technologies has stimulated and motivated the scientific efforts toward the full characterization of the geometry of the set of states of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "for both fundamental and technological reasons , the interest has been focused on the characterization of entangled states , that is , those states of a composite system exhibiting nonclassical correlations among their parties . while the case of bipartite systems has been extensively studied and  at least for pure states",
    " is nowadays well understood @xcite , the case of genuinely multipartite entanglement is still not fully mastered .",
    "the present contribution deals with the problem of multipartite - entanglement characterization by focusing on the phenomenon of _ entanglement frustration _ @xcite .",
    "in particular , we will explore gaussian states of continuous variable ( cv ) systems , that is , systems of ( quasi - free ) quantum harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "specifically , we consider a suitable cost function , the _ potential of multipartite entanglement _",
    ", introduced in @xcite and extended to the gaussian framework in @xcite , as a quantifier of frustration .",
    "the fact that this cost function can not saturate its minimum value is a symptom of a sort of frustration of entanglement , induced by the geometry of the quantum phase space , which prevents the states to be maximally bipartite - entangled among all the possible system bipartitions .",
    "here we consider a family of entanglement cost - functions , generalizing the one introduced in @xcite .",
    "we hence derive new results on their minima in the low and high energy limits .",
    "our analysis focuses on a system of @xmath0 quantum harmonic oscillators , namely a set of @xmath0 bosonic modes , described by the canonical variables @xmath1 . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we assume all oscillators to be identical , although distinguishable , with unit frequency , and set @xmath2 . we follow @xcite and consider the manifold of gaussian states of the @xmath0-mode system .",
    "let us recall that a gaussian state @xmath3 is characterized by the first and second moments of the canonical variables , that is , the mean @xmath4 , and the covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath5 , with elements @xmath6 .",
    "we assume , without loss of generality , @xmath7 , and restrict our attention to pure states .",
    "the cm of a pure state can be written in the form @xmath8 with @xmath9 where @xmath10 is diagonal and nonsingular , @xmath11 denotes the null matrix , and @xmath12 is a symplectic orthogonal matrix , characterized by the property that @xmath13 is unitary .",
    "finally , we impose a bound on the mean energy per mode , that is , @xmath14 with @xmath15 the number of mean excitations per mode .",
    "this is one of a number of physical constraints that must be imposed on the system in order to make the problem mathematically ( and physically ) well posed .",
    "a different approach to entanglement frustration , that makes no use of energy constraints , has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we consider _ purity _ as an estimator of bipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "given a bipartition into two subsystems @xmath16 , associated with two subsets of respectively @xmath17 and @xmath18 bosonic modes ( @xmath19 ) , the purity of the subsystems reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the sub - matrix of the cm identified by the indices belonging to subsystem @xmath22 .",
    "here we have assumed without loss of generality @xmath23 .",
    "it can be easily proven that under the constraint ( [ energy ] ) the minimum value of the purity is @xcite @xmath24 the range of the purity is @xmath25 $ ] , where the value @xmath26 characterizes _ factorized states _ , and the value @xmath27 characterizes those states which are _ maximally bipartite - entangled _ across the bipartition considered .      in order to study multipartite entanglement",
    "we introduce the _ normalized potential of multipartite entanglement _",
    ", a cost function defined for any pair @xmath28 by the ( normalized ) expectation value @xmath29 of the purity over all possible bipartition of given size : @xmath30 \\nonumber \\\\ & = { n \\choose n_a}^{-1 } \\sum_{|a|=n_a } \\frac{\\pi_a}{\\pi^\\mathrm{min}_{n_a}(n ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & = ( n+1/2)^{n_a } \\mathbb{e}\\left[\\det(\\mathbb{v}_a)^{-1/2}\\right ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the range of the cost function is contained in the interval @xmath31 $ ] , where the lower bound characterizes the so - called _ perfect mmes _ ( maximally multipartite - entangled states ) @xcite , which are maximally bipartite - entangled across all bipartitions of size @xmath32",
    ". however , as shown in @xcite , the geometry of the manifold of cv gaussian states prevents the minimum of the cost function to saturate the lower bound , that is , @xmath33 a feature that is interpreted as _ frustration of entanglement_.    numerical results for the case of balanced bipartitions ( @xmath34 $ ] ) were presented in @xcite .",

    "two limiting regimes are identified , corresponding to @xmath38 and @xmath39 : in the former case we notice a linear regime for increasing values of @xmath15 ; in the latter , @xmath35 saturates to a constant that depends on the value of @xmath0 .",
