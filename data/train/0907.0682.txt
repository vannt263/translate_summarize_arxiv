    "recent measurements of high energy cosmic rays reported by different collaborations have attracted a great deal of attention as , in contrast to what is expected from spallation of primary cosmic rays on the interstellar medium , the electron / positron flux exhibits intriguing features . the pamela collaboration saw a rise in the ratio of positron to electron - plus - positron fluxes at energies 10 - 100 gev @xcite .",
    "the atic experiment reported the discovery of a peak in the total electron - plus - positron flux at energies 600 - 700 gev @xcite and more recently the fermi  lat @xcite collaboration reported an excess on the total electron - plus - positron flux in the same energy range as atic but less pronounced @xcite .",
    "these findings in addition to those published by the hess @xcite , heat @xcite , and ppb - bets @xcite experiments might be indicating the presence of a nearby source of electrons and positrons .",
    "possible sources can have an astrophysical origin e.g. nearby pulsars @xcite but more interesting they can be related with either dark matter ( dm ) annihilation @xcite or decay @xcite . in particular , decaying dm scenarios are quite appealing as , in contrast to models relying on dm annihilation , they are readily reconcilable with the observed electron - positron excess @xcite .    in r - parity breaking models the lsp is unstable and its lifetime is determined by supersymmetric parameters and r - parity breaking couplings . depending on their values ,",
    "the phenomenological implications of a decaying lsp can range from collider physics up to cosmology and astrophysics . in the later case",
    "the possibility of a long  lived , but not absolutely stable lsp , leads to decaying dm scenarios as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and indeed they have been recently reconsidered as a pathway to explain the observed anomalies in cosmic  ray electron / positron fluxes @xcite .",
    "so far , most of the analyses have been carried out by _ ad hoc _ selections of particular sets of r - parity violating couplings and/or by assuming tiny couplings .",
    "thus , it will be desirable to build a general framework for supersymmetric decaying dm in which the allowed couplings and their relative sizes arise from generic considerations rather than from _ ad hoc _ choices as was done in @xcite .",
    "this is the purpose of this work .    in supersymmetric models extended to include an anomalous horizontal @xmath0 symmetry _",
    " la _ froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) @xcite , the standard model particles and their superpartners do not carry a r - parity quantum number and instead carry a horizontal charge ( @xmath1charge ) . for a review see @xcite .",
    "in addition , these kinds of models involve new heavy fn fields and , in the simplest realizations , an electroweak singlet superfield @xmath2 of @xmath1charge @xmath3 .",
    "r - parity conserving as well as r - parity violating @xmath4 invariant effective terms arise once below the fn fields scale ( @xmath5 ) the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "these terms involve factors of the type @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is fixed by the horizontal charges of the fields involved and determines whether a particular term can or can not be present in the superpotential .",
    "the holomorphy of the superpotential forbids all the terms for which @xmath8 and although they will be generated after @xmath0 symmetry breaking ( triggered by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar component of @xmath2 , @xmath9 ) via the khler potential @xcite these terms are in general much more suppressed than those for which @xmath10 .",
    "terms with fractional @xmath7 are also forbidden and in contrast to those with @xmath8 there is no mechanism through which they can be generated .",
    "finally , once @xmath0 is broken the terms with positive @xmath7 yield yukawa couplings determined  up to order one factors  by @xmath11 .",
    "the standard model fermion yukawa couplings typically arise from terms of this kind .",
    "correspondingly , supersymmetric models based on an @xmath0 abelian factor are completely specified in terms of the @xmath1charges .    in the case of supersymmetric models based on an anomalous @xmath0 flavor symmetry the quark masses , the quark mixing angles , the charged lepton masses , and the conditions of anomaly cancellation",
    "constrain the possible @xmath1charge assignments @xcite .",
    "since the number of constraints is always smaller than the number of @xmath1charges some of them are necessarily unconstrained and apart from theoretical upper bounds on their values @xcite they can be regarded as free parameters that should be determined by additional phenomenological input . for this purpose",
    "neutrino experimental data has been used resulting in models in which neutrino masses are explained @xcite .",
    "here we adopt another approach by assuming a decaying neutralino as a dark matter candidate .",
    "we will show that astrophysical and cosmological observations exclude the possibility of having neutralino decays induced by bilinear r - parity violating couplings and that this in turn lead to a variety of purely trilinear r - parity breaking scenarios among which we found models that feature a single trilinear r - parity breaking coupling ( minimal trilinear r - parity violating models ) and that turn out to be suitable to explain the reported anomalies in cosmic - ray electron / positron fluxes in either models with tev - ish supersymmetric mass spectra or split supersymmetry .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : charges ] we will describe the possible models that arise as a consequence of the constraints imposed by astrophysical and cosmological observations on a decaying neutralino as dark matter .",
    "we will focus on the resulting minimal trilinear r - parity violating models and discuss some realizations coming from specific @xmath1charge assignments . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pamela - fermi - atic ] we will show that current data on cosmic - ray electron / positron fluxes are well described by these type of models . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we will summarize and present our conclusions .",
    "the most general supersymmetric version of the standard model has a renormalizable superpotential given by @xmath12 where latin indices @xmath13 run over the fermion generations whereas greek indices @xmath14 run from 0 up to 3 . in the notation",
    "we are using @xmath15 and the fermion yukawa couplings are given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "bilinear couplings @xmath18 as well as the trilinear parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 break lepton number whereas baryon number is broken by the couplings @xmath21 .",
    "when extending a supersymmetric model with a @xmath0 abelian factor , the size of all the parameters entering in the superpotential arises as a consequence of @xmath0 breaking .",
    "in particular , the lepton and baryon number couplings are well suppressed or can even be absent without the need of @xmath22parity @xcite    these kinds of frameworks are string inspired in the sense that the anomalous @xmath0 symmetry may be a remnant of a string model @xcite implying that the _ natural _ scale of the fn fields @xmath5 can be identified with @xmath23 and that anomaly cancellations can proceed through the green - schwarz mechanism @xcite . below the string scale , the terms in the superpotential [ eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) ] as well as the khler potential are generated after @xmath0 breaking induced by @xmath9 and as we already discussed may be vanishing or suppressed depending on the @xmath1charge assignments of the different fields involved which in string models are always constrained to be not too large .",
    "accordingly , in what follows we will constrain the @xmath1charges to satisfy the condition @xmath24 that as highlighted in refs . @xcite",
    "leads to a complete consistent supersymmetric flavor model .    before proceeding we will fix our notation : following ref .",
    "@xcite we will denote a field and its @xmath1charge with the same symbol , i.e. @xmath25 , @xmath1charge differences as @xmath26 @xcite , bilinear @xmath1charges as @xmath27 , and trilinear @xmath1charges according to @xmath28 with the index determined by the corresponding trilinear coupling , that is to say the index can be given by @xmath19 , @xmath20 , or @xmath21 .",
    "we fix @xmath29 @xcite and @xmath30 without loss of generality .",
    "furthermore we parametrize @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) such that it ranges from 90 to 1 for @xmath33 running from 0 to 3 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .    as already stressed any coupling in the superpotential",
    "is determined up to order 1 factors by its @xmath1charge .",
    "thus , any bilinear or trilinear couplings @xmath34 and @xmath35 must be given by @xcite @xmath36 the individual @xmath1charges in turn are determined by a set of phenomenological and theoretical conditions which can be listed as follows :    * eight phenomenological constraints arising from six quark and lepton mass ratios plus two quark mixing angles : @xmath37 once imposed they give rise to the constraints ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) @xmath38 and those given in table [ tab:1 ] . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the negative values in eq .",

    "some words are in order concerning the minimal trilinear @xmath22parity violating models with superheavy sleptons . in split",
    "supersymmetry the scalar masses , apart from the higgs boson , are well above the electroweak scale , @xmath40 gev . assuming @xmath41 gev it can be seen from fig .  [ fig : lambda ] that the correct neutralino lifetime requires couplings of order @xmath42 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:667 ] ) couplings of this size will lead to @xmath43 in sharp disagreement with the bounds from astrophysical and cosmological data @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to previous analysis of neutralino decaying dm within split supersymmetry @xcite , in this context the rge running of the trilinear @xmath22parity breaking parameters do not induce any @xmath22parity breaking bilinear coupling .",

    "moreover , the effect of @xmath46 on dark matter relic density is completely negligible for @xmath57gev @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the results in fig . [ fig : pamela ] also hold in the case of superheavy sleptons and _ large _ couplings .",
    "we have studied decaying neutralinos as dm candidates in the context of supersymmetric models extended with an anomalous @xmath0 flavor symmetry . we have shown that theoretical motivated limits on the standard model field @xmath1charges in addition to astrophysical and cosmological constraints on neutralino decaying dm forbid the decays induced by bilinear @xmath22parity breaking couplings and allow one to define a set of purely trilinear @xmath22parity violating models in which the neutralino can be stable on cosmological scales . among all these scenarios",
    "we have found a class of models ( minimal @xmath22parity violating models ) in which a single @xmath22parity and lepton number breaking coupling @xmath19 ( @xmath58 ) give rise to leptonic neutralino decays . in these schemes , for a few tev neutralino mass , a decaying lifetime of @xmath59 sec can be readily achieved for a variety of @xmath1charge assignments and slepton masses ranging from few tev up to the typical scales of split supersymmetry .",
    "moreover , we have shown that these minimal @xmath22parity violating models ( depending on the trilinear @xmath22parity breaking parameter defining the model itself ) provide an explanation to the observed anomalies in the electron - positron fluxes reported by pamela , atic , and fermi  lat .",
