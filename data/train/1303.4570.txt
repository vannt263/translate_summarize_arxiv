    "since the creation of the first bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , ultracold atoms have proven to be a versatile tool for many applications like precision measurement , quantum simulation , and quantum information processing .",
    "two of the main techniques that made these achievements possible are the creation of various trapping potentials , like optical lattices ( ols ) or wave guides and the precise control of the interatomic interaction by means of feshbach resonances ( frs ) @xcite .",
    "an important tool for describing ultracold atoms in ols is the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model .",
    "the model uses in its basic form a basis of single - particle wannier states from the first bloch band to formulate the many - body hamiltonian . while for weak interactions",
    "the model is very accurate , it usually breaks down for larger scattering lengths .",
    "a way to extend its applicability at a broad fr is to introduce effective bh parameters especially for the onsite interaction strength @xmath0 .",
    "these parameters can be obtained by using a corrected harmonic approximation of the lattice sites @xcite or by full numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "the usual bh model allows via the onsite - interaction strength @xmath0 either for repulsively interacting atoms ( @xmath1 ) or attractively interacting atoms ( @xmath2 ) . at a narrow fr , however , a relatively narrow avoided crossing with the resonant bound state leads to the appearance of both repulsively and attractively interacting states @xcite .",
    "in this situation the resonant bound state must be explicitly included into the bh model .",
    "several different kinds of these extended models have been introduced and debated @xcite and applied to map out the phase diagramm @xcite or to investigate lattice solitons @xcite .",
    "the above investigations consider the extended hubbard model within a single - band approximation that is only applicable in the rare situation that the coupling energy to the resonant bound state is small compared to the band gap . in order to generalize the applicability",
    "one can introduce the notion of dressed molecules with effective bound - state energies and coupling strengths obtained from more elaborate calculations @xcite .",
    "a convenient approach to generalize hubbard models to describe broader frs or systems with a large scattering length is to simply include more bloch bands .",
    "for example , l .- m .",
    "duan has derived an effective single - band hubbard model for the case of interacting fermions at a broad fr starting from a multi - band hubbard model in the wannier basis and a zero - range coupling between atoms and molecules @xcite .",
    "however , as will be discussed in this work , severe numerical problems arise for the description of a system with a zero - range coupling , e.g. , by expanding the solution in products of single - particle basis functions . especially for large scattering lengths",
    "all of these basis functions behave completely differently for @xmath3 compared with the correct solution .",
    "this poses a problem especially for positive scattering lengths where the open channel supports a bound state .",
    "in fact , the obtained energies are lower than the correct ones so that an increase of the basis leads to an even larger disagreement .",
    "a similar problem also appears when replacing the interaction potential by the delta - like fermi - huang pseudo - potential  @xcite . also within analytical treatments of frs in harmonic traps that use non - interacting basis states",
    "the eigenenergies do not converge  @xcite . in this case , after an infinite summation , the diverging terms can be absorbed by introducing a renormalized bound - state energy . in many numerical approaches",
    "the problem is circumvented by replacing the delta - like potential by a regularized short range potential @xcite . in order to resolve the potential",
    "usually a large basis is necessary .",
    "for example , for an interaction with the range @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lattice spacing more than @xmath6 bloch bands have to be included to converge the energies @xcite . since for two atoms in a one dimensional lattice the number of basis functions scales quadratically with the number of bloch bands and the number of sites",
    "the solution can quickly become numerically very demanding .",
    "based on this corrected numerical approach , m.l .",
    "wall and l.d .",
    "carr were able to calculated the effective parameters of a fermi hubbard model that takes the coupling to a bosonic molecule explicitly into account @xcite .",
    "in this work we introduce an extended bh model that avoids the numerical problems in the presence of a delta - like coupling without the need of regularization and inclusion of many bloch bands .",
    "the model is derived from first principles on the basis of the analytic microscopic theory of frs in a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "this allows for defining dressed bound - state energies and couplings that correct for the problems due to the deficiency of the basis states .",
    "given the number of different proposals to describe frs within a bh model one has to compare the predictions of the introduced bh model with non - perturbative calculations . in the standard description of frs",
    "this requires to solve a two - channel problem of two interacting atoms in an optical lattice coupled at short distance to a molecular bound state .",
    "this problem is numerically very demanding .",
    "however , we show that one can largely simplify the problem by introducing a square - well interaction potential that realistically mimics the behavior at a fr . using this single - channel interaction potential",
    "we apply an approach introduced in @xcite in order to obtain the correct energies and wave functions of two atoms in a small ol at a fr .",
    "the correct stationary and dynamic behavior of two atoms in a double - well potential is compared with the results of the introduced bh model .",
    "it is shown that with only a small number of bloch bands included the bh model is able to accurately describe frs of small and medium width with coupling energies up to the depth of the ol .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
