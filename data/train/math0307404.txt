    "in other words our definition of the metric @xmath133 is invariant under conformal transformations on @xmath9 . to see this",

    "thus the norm ( denoted by @xmath145 ) on @xmath68 computed using metrics of the form @xmath146 also gives the norm for metrics @xmath128 conformally equivalent to those of the form ( [ e : form ] ) .",
    "in fact in dimension 2 every riemannian metric is locally diffeomorphic to one which is conformally equivalent to a metric of constant curvature ( see @xcite section 3.3 ) .",
    "this shows that all metrics on @xmath4 are conformally equivalent to a metric of constant curvature , one of the three listed in ( [ d : constcurv ] ) , for which the norm ( [ e : norm ] ) may be computed as in ( [ e : components ] ) .",

    "the volume of the moduli space defined using reidemeister - ray - singer torsion is independent of the choice of metric on the 2-manifold either orientable or nonorientable . the riemannian volume , however , is a different story . for an orientable 2-manifold ,",
    "the moduli space of flat connections is a khler manifold , so the riemannian volume equals the symplectic volume , and is thus independent of the choice of metric . for a nonorientable surface , witten remarks in @xcite ( p. 163 ) that the riemannian volume does depends on the metric . according to @xcite ( 2.38 )",
    "the torsion volume and the riemannian volume differ ( in this case ) by a ratio of determinants of elliptic operators ( generalized laplacians on lie algebra - valued differential forms ) .",
    "our results are consistent with this observation , and at the same time provide an evaluation of this ratio of determinants .",
    "we explore the hyperbolic case first .",
    "note that if @xmath7 has genus @xmath147 then by the uniformization theorem it is equipped with a unique metric of constant scalar curvature @xmath23 ( in other words a hyperbolic metric ) .",
    "this is one motivation for choosing a hyperbolic metric on @xmath4 , although such a metric will be singular at one point .    a riemann surface with one boundary component and genus @xmath148 always has a hyperbolic metric with constant curvature @xmath149 @xcite . for this reason we construct a metric on @xmath4 for which the boundary is a geodesic and which is hyperbolic with constant curvature @xmath23 at all but one point .",
    "we do this by gluing the edges of an isosceles geodesic hyperbolic triangle using an orientation reversing map : this process identifies all three vertices of the triangle , and the vertex becomes the point where the metric does not have constant curvature @xmath23 ( indeed , the metric is singular at this point ) .",
    "[ singular ] the reason why this procedure gives a natural metric on the",
    "2-manifold formed by taking the connected sum of a riemann surface of genus @xmath150 with @xmath2 is that a riemann surface of genus @xmath151 with one or two boundary components always has a hyperbolic metric with constant curvature for which the boundary components are geodesics .",
    "this metric can be obtained from a pants decomposition of the riemann surface , where each pair of pants is equipped with a hyperbolic metric for which the boundary components are geodesics .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "hence the connected sum of a riemann surface with @xmath2 has a metric which is hyperbolic at all but one point , and the connected sum of a riemann surface with two copies of @xmath2 has a metric which is hyperbolic at all but 2 points . to form @xmath2 with one disc removed , we recall that the two edges of the triangle are identified using an orientation reversing map . in figure 1",
    "this corresponds to identifying @xmath26 with @xmath27 using an orientation reversing map which maps @xmath152 to @xmath153 and maps @xmath154 to @xmath155 .",

    ", the geodesic triangle has one distinguished vertex @xmath25 ( which serves as the origin for geodesic polar coordinates ) .",
    "the sides @xmath33 are geodesics .",
    "we introduce geodesic polar coordinates @xmath156 ( using the hyperbolic metric on the upper half plane , which is assumed to contain the triangle ) with @xmath25 as the origin : here @xmath11 is the distance from a chosen point @xmath25 and @xmath18 is the polar angle .",

    "the only smooth constant curvature metric on @xmath4 for which the boundary is a geodesic is the euclidean metric . for the geodesic triangle @xmath9 equipped with the euclidean metric , we get @xmath199 so @xmath200 and @xmath201 the geodesic @xmath28 is given by @xmath202 so we have @xmath203 and from ( [ e : components ] ) and ( [ tangamdef ] ) @xmath204 @xmath205 thus the norm @xmath206 is given by @xmath207 for an appropriate function @xmath208 which depends on the angle @xmath100 and on the choice of euclidean metric .",

    "a pair @xmath365 gives a conformal structure on the triangle .",

    "in this section , we will consider witten s volume formula for the moduli space of flat connections on a 2-manifold , and give a new proof of these formulas using haar measure .",
    "notice that witten did not give a proof exclusively using haar measure to compute the volume of the moduli space .",
    "witten gave three arguments for the formula in @xcite :    * in section 2 , witten used results of migdal @xcite involving lattice gauge theories to compute the yang - mills partition function in two dimensions .",
    "migdal s result only makes sense when the yang - mills partition function has been regularized , giving a result which reduces to the volume of the moduli space when the regularization parameter tends to @xmath21 . * in section 3 ,",
    "witten deduced the result from the verlinde formula , which is a formula for the riemann - roch number of the prequantum line bundle of the moduli space @xmath366 of flat connections on a 2-manifold , @xmath367 .",
    "since the cohomology class of the symplectic form @xmath368 is the first chern class of @xmath179 , we may expect that the leading order term in the riemann - roch number ( as a polynomial in @xmath369 ) is @xmath370 . * in section 4 ,",
    "witten characterized the volume of the moduli space using reidemeister - ray - singer torsion .",
    "he used the fact that reidemeister torsion is multiplicative : if @xmath366 is the union of two submanifolds @xmath371 and @xmath372 with boundary @xmath373 , glued along the boundary , then @xmath374 where the torsion is viewed as a ratio of determinants of elliptic operators and the above quotient makes sense in terms of the mayer - vietoris sequence which computes the cohomology groups of @xmath366 from those of @xmath375 @xmath372 and @xmath373 .",
    "since the moduli space can be identified with the space of representations of a surface group ( in other words @xmath376 ) and a compact lie group has a natural riemannian measure , the haar measure , we can try to understand witten s formula for the moduli space by pushing forward the haar measure on @xmath40 .",

    "thus we have@xmath380    recall that @xmath381 is the volume of the conjugacy class containing @xmath283 as defined for example in @xcite(4.53 ) : @xmath382 where @xmath46 represents the measure on @xmath298 obtained by pushing down the haar measure on @xmath40 ( under the natural map from a group element to its conjugacy class ) and @xmath299 represents the measure on @xmath298 obtained by restricting the metric on @xmath57 to lie(@xmath294 ) ( which determines a haar measure on @xmath294 ) and then identifying lie(@xmath294 ) with the tangent space to @xmath298 .",

    "the induction hypothesis is valid for @xmath409 because by @xcite ( 2.43 ) we have @xmath410 and the space @xmath411 is one point if @xmath412 and empty otherwise , so its volume is @xmath413 .    consider a torus @xmath414 with one boundary component .",
