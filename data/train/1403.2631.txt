    "the emergence of superconductivity in strongly - correlated electron systems has become quite a common phenomenon , observed by now in a wealth of different materials that include also so - called heavy - fermion compounds , where unconventional superconductivity was first reported in cecu@xmath5si@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite the characteristic properties of heavy fermions derive from the coexistence of itinerant electrons and localized moments residing on partly filled @xmath6-shells of rare earth or actinide ions .",
    "the pairing mechanism in heavy fermions has been the subject of an intense debate , also in connection with high - temperature superconductors ,  @xcite with which heavy fermions share unconventional pairing symmetry .",
    "for instance , recent scanning tunnelling spectroscopy on cecoln@xmath7 unveiled the presence of nodal points in the superconducting gap compatible with a @xmath8 symmetry ,  @xcite just like in cuprates .",
    "the widely accepted picture is that pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations of a nearby antiferromagnetic phase , as suggested for cepd@xmath5si@xmath5 and cein@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite this view is supported by the evidence that superconductivity in heavy fermions almost always appears in the vicinity of the quantum critical point that separates a paramagnetic metal phase from a magnetically - ordered one .",
    "@xcite even more remarkably , some compounds show a coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity , as observed in cerhsi@xmath5 ,  @xcite cerhin@xmath7 ,  @xcite and ceco(in@xmath10cd@xmath11)@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite    from the theoretical side , the kondo lattice model ( klm ) , which has been introduced by doniach in 1977 ,  @xcite is believed to capture the basic properties of heavy fermions . while in one spatial dimension its physical behavior is well understood ,  @xcite the more relevant two- and three - dimensional cases are much less known , especially concerning ( possible ) superconducting properties .",
    "most of the analytical understanding is based upon slave bosons and large-@xmath12 approaches ,  @xcite which find that @xmath3-wave superconductivity can be indeed stabilized in two dimensions through the resonating - valence bond ( rvb ) mechanism , similarly to what has been suggested long ago by anderson for high - temperature superconductors .",
    "@xcite as far as numerical calculations are concerned , unfortunately quantum monte carlo methods suffer from sign problems away from the compensated regime ( where the number of itinerant electrons equals the number of localized spin-1/2 moments ) , while exact diagonalization and density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) are limited to small clusters . nonetheless , dmrg calculations suggest that the standard klm does not support superconductivity .",
    "@xcite this is also the conclusion of variational monte carlo calculations , which show that @xmath3-wave pairing is indeed present in the paramagnetic sector of the klm , but it is easily defeated by magnetism .",
    "@xcite instead , recent dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) results obtained some evidence for an unexpected @xmath13-wave superconductivity close to the compensated regime and relatively large kondo coupling .",
    "@xcite    in general , the weakness of superconductivity seems the consequence of the strength of magnetism , reinforced in the model calculation by the bipartite square lattice and by the unfrustrated hopping .",
    "since lack of magnetic frustration is rather exceptional in real materials , it is worth and legitimate to investigate how frustration modifies the phase diagram of the klm .",
    "@xcite frustration in real heavy - fermion materials may take various forms .",
    "in certain cases , it can appear as a direct geometric frustration , as in the pyrochlore material pr@xmath5ir@xmath5o@xmath14  @xcite and in the shastry - sutherland lattice compound yb@xmath5pt@xmath5pb ,  @xcite in others by competing interactions of various kinds .",
    "the role of frustration in the klm has been investigated in different works , especially focusing on magnetic properties .",
    "@xcite more recently , dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) calculations on the periodic anderson model also suggested that frustration may lead to @xmath3-wave superconductivity in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point .",
    "@xcite    there is another ingredient worth to be included to better reproduce the phase diagram of heavy fermions .",
    "realistically , one expects that @xmath6-electrons are mutually coupled mostly through the conduction electrons , i.e. , via the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) exchange .",
    "however , most of the approximate methods used to study the klm are unable to account for the rkky interaction , unless long - range magnetic order is explicitly assumed .",
    "this inserts a bias in the calculations , since magnetic solutions can profit from the rkky interaction , while non - magnetic ones can not even exploit short - range magnetic correlations , e.g. , to stabilize superconductivity .",
    "a way to mitigate this flaw is to add a direct @xmath15 exchange @xmath4 mimicking the actual rkky interaction .",
    "the role of @xmath4 for reproducing the magnetic properties of heavy fermions has been highlighted several times .",
    "@xcite moreover , there are also suggestions that @xmath4 may be important to understand superconductivity in upd@xmath5al@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we show that the underlying superconducting properties of the kondo lattice model naturally emerge whenever magnetism is frustrated and/or local cooper pairs are reinforced by a direct @xmath15 exchange . here",
    ", the mechanism leading to superconductivity can be captured by the standard approach where spin fluctuations mediate pairing ; however , without these extra ingredients , pairing is not strong enough to overcome magnetic long - range order .",
    "one of the main signatures of this mechanism is the @xmath8 symmetry of the order parameter , which arises from the indirect coupling of conducting electrons through localized moments .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the klm and describe the numerical method , in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present the results , and finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "we explore the phase diagram of an extended klm on a square lattice described by the hamiltonian : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 imply that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are nearest neighbors and next - nearest neighbors , respectively ; @xmath21 is the spin 1/2-operator of the local moment at site @xmath19 , and @xmath22 that of the conduction electrons .",
    "hereafter , we shall refer to the frustrated kondo lattice model ( fklm ) when @xmath23 but @xmath24 , and to the kondo - heisenberg lattice model ( khlm ) in the opposite case of @xmath25 but @xmath26 .",

    "let us now consider magnetic states .",
    "we recall that , in the absence of frustration , the magnetic solution has always lower energy than the superconducting one , when the latter is stable , hence the actual phase diagram does not include superconductivity at all .",

    "[ fig : phase - diagram ] .",
