    "predictions are made by standard stellar models ( e.g. , @xcite ) about the surface abundances of elements in stars . however , there are indications that such models are incomplete .",
    "a case in point is the surface abundance of the element lithium ( li ) in low mass stars , which is observed to decrease with time .",
    "the solar meteoritic value for the li abundance is 3.31@xmath00.04 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a study of li abundances in young , pre - main - sequence ( pms ) t tauri stars ( tts ) suggests a value of log n(li ) = 3.2@xmath00.3 ( @xcite ) , consistent with the meteoritic value .",
    "while this is one indicator of the initial li abundance , tts abundance determinations are beset by complications due to their youth , such as uncertain @xmath1 estimates and the presence of a circumstellar accretion disk .",
    "the study of stars in open clusters of different ages , like @xmath2 persei ( 50 myr ) and the pleiades ( 70100 myr ) , shows that there is nearly a uniform li abundance of 3.2 for high mass stars ( @xmath3 k ) .",
    "it is known that surface li depletion takes place during the pms evolution of low mass stars due to li burning via ( @xmath4 , @xmath2 ) reactions at low temperatures of @xmath5 k. surface depletion can occur in standard models through convective mixing if the base of the convection zone is hot enough to burn li ( @xcite , @xcite ) . because pms stars have deep convection zones , they burn li during the pms . as the depth of the convection zone",
    "is a function of mass ( increasing with lower mass ) li is depleted on the main sequence only in lower mass stars ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) .",
    "however , the pleiades evinces a large dispersion in surface li abundance at a given color for @xmath8 k ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "standard stellar models are unable to reproduce this dispersion .",
    "furthermore , open cluster observations indicate some depletion is observed on the main sequence as well , which is in conflict with standard standard models .    because these models can not fully explain the observed depletion patterns , additional mixing mechanisms seem necessary .",
    "rotation provides one driving mechanism for such non - convective mixing , through meridional circulation ( @xcite , @xcite ) and instabilities caused by differential rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , rotation in stars has received much scrutiny as a possible agent of li depletion and of the observed scatter in open cluster li abundances at a given mass .",
    "models which include rotational mixing ( @xcite ) are able to predict the dispersion seen in older systems , but not at young ages like that of the pleiades ( @xcite ) .",
    "the study of li abundances is a rich and vast field , and there have been several efforts to study the correlation of surface li abundances with rotation using stars in open clusters . here",
    ", we concentrate on the connection between surface li abundance and rotation using data in the young pleiades cluster .    because the pleiades li scatter is such a difficult obstacle in our understanding of early stellar evolution",
    ", a historical summary seems in order .",
    "butler et al .",
    "( 1987 ) studied a sample of 11 k - stars in the pleiades and determined that four rapid rotators had higher li abundances than four slow rotators .",
    "they believed this consistent with the evolutionary picture that on arrival on the main sequence , stars had high rotation rates and high li abundances ( i.e. , they arrived on the main sequence before there was time for rotational braking or li depletion ) .",
    "as the star spun down , the li abundance decreased as well .",
    "hence , they concluded that the faster rotators were younger than the slower , hence less depleted .    a study of the distribution of rotational velocities of low - mass stars in the pleiades by stauffer & hartmann ( 1987 ) revealed that there was a wide range of rotation velocities in the pleiades k and m dwarfs .",
    "they showed that the distribution of rotation velocities in the pleiades could be reproduced quite well invoking angular momentum loss , without having to resort to a large age spread which is also in conflict with the narrow main - sequence seen among the low - mass pleiades stars .",
    "soderblom et al .  ( 1993b ) carried out an extensive study of li abundances in the pleiades .",
    "they considered several possible explanations for the dispersion in the observed abundances , including observational errors and the effect of starspots .",
    "they concluded that the spread in li abundances seen was real and not an artifact of other physical conditions .",
    "they found that the li abundance was correlated well with both rotation and chromospheric activity , and speculated that rapid rotation was somehow able to preserve li in stars . while they found some low @xmath9 systems with high li abundances , it was possible that these stars are faster rotators simply seen at low inclination .",
    "balachandran et al .  (",
    "1988 ) studied a sample of stars in the younger @xmath2 persei cluster ( 50 myr ) and concurred with the picture of li - poor stars as slow rotators .",
    "however , a comparison of the pleiades to @xmath2 per by soderblom et al .",
    "( 1993b ) showed that while most stars had similar abundances , a significant number of stars in @xmath2 per had abundances that were less than that in the pleiades by 1 dex or more .",
    "this was difficult to understand until balachandran et al .",
    "( 1996 ) published a corrected list of li abundances that culled all non - members from the sample , bringing consistency to the pleiades and @xmath2 per abundances .",
    "garcia lopez et al .",
    "( 1991a , b ) added seven stars to the butler et al .  sample in the range @xmath10 k and asserted a clear connection between li abundance and @xmath9 .",
    "they also found that the correlation breaks down for temperatures cooler than 4500 k. in a subsequent paper in 1994 , they enlarged their sample and further studied the correlation , concluding that their earlier assertion was correct",
    " there were no rapid rotators with low li abundances and there was a clear relationship between log n(li ) and @xmath9 .",
    "they did note three stars ( 320 , 380 and 1124 ) having low @xmath9 values and li abundances comparable to those of the rapid rotators as counterexamples , but speculated these objects were rapid rotators seen at low inclination angles .",
    "it is to be noted that , when determining mean abundances for their rapid and slow rotator populations , they included the 3 stars with low @xmath9 and high li abundances in their rapid rotator sample .",
    "while this does not change the qualitative result they obtained , it does affect the magnitude of the difference in abundance between the two populations .",
    "it also demonstrates that there is a range of abundances for slow rotators .",
    "jones et al .",
    "( 1996a ) derived li abundances and rotation velocities for 15 late - k pleiades dwarfs , and also found that the correlation between li abundance and rapid rotation breaks down for cooler stars ( @xmath11 k ) .",
    "jones et al .  ( 1997 ) determined rotational velocities and li abundances in the 250 myr old cluster m34 , intermediate in age between the young pleiades ( 70100 myr ) and the hyades ( 500 myr ) .",
    "they concluded that the li depletion and rotation velocities were in between the pleiades and hyades values , and that the pattern seen in these clusters suggested an evolutionary sequence for angular momentum loss and li depletion .",
    "one could speculate that some of the li dispersion in the pleiades and @xmath2 per may be due to nlte effects and unknown effects of stellar activity on the line formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; but see soderblom et al .",
    "the structural effects of rotation might also be responsible for the li depletion pattern .",
    "martin & claret ( 1996 ) included this ingredient in their models for masses of 0.7 and 0.8 m@xmath7 and were able to produce enhanced li abundances for stars with high initial angular momenta as a result of less effective pms li destruction in rapid rotators ( i.e. , their models imply initially rapid rotators will have high li abundances relative to the other stars at the same @xmath12 at young ages ) .",
    "angular momentum loss as well as rotationally - induced mixing could affect these models .",
    "the questions we consider here are if there truly is a correlation between li abundance and rotation rate in the pleiades , what the nature of the correlation is , and if not , what might explain the abundance scatter .",
    "we start with a careful sample selection for our analysis , and examine various possible causes that might contribute to the dispersion ( including errors in abundance determination ) .",
    "we then proceed to an analysis of the li - rotation correlation and explore other possible correlations that might be masquerading as a li - rotation correlation .",
    "lithium abundances were derived from the datasets in the studies of soderblom _ et al . _",
    "( 1993a ; s93a ) and jones _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the two studies were merged to form our starting sample with the latter data preferred in cases of overlap .",
    "secondary stellar companions can affect photometric colors from which @xmath12 values are derived , activity levels , measured line strengths , and activity levels deduced spectroscopically .",
    "thus , in order to look at the intrinsic pleiades li abundance dispersion unrelated ( directly or indirectly ) to the presence of a stellar companion , binary systems were excised from our sample . cluster and interloping field binaries identified by mermilliod _",
    "et al . _  ( 1992 ) and bouvier _ et al . _  ( 1997 ) were removed from the starting sample .",
    "two spectroscopic binaries not in these lists , but identified as such by s93a , were also removed .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram of this refined sample was then inspected to photometrically identify binaries using the dereddened @xmath13 photometry described by pinsonneault _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) .",
    "we found 739 to be an obviously overluminous ( or overly red ) outliar in the @xmath14 vs.  @xmath15 , @xmath14 vs.  @xmath16 , and @xmath17 vs.  @xmath16 diagrams , and eliminated it from the refined sample .",
    "finally , all stars with upper limits on the @xmath18 line s equivalent width were eliminated .",
    "these upper limits , as censored data , complicate the ensuing statistical analysis .",
    "these stars are also the very hottest and very coolest in the sample",
    ". their photometrically - inferred @xmath12 values and model atmospheres may be slightly more uncertain than the other objects in the sample .",
    "their elimination simplifies the analysis and reduces possible additional sources of uncertainty .",
    "this final sample of 76 pleiades stars is listed in the first column of table 1 .",
    "the extinction - corrected @xmath14 magnitude and reddening - corrected @xmath19 and @xmath20 colors are given in the second , third , and fourth columns .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram of these stars evinces a tight main sequence , and is shown in figure 1 ( open circles ) with a 100 myr isochrone described in pinsonneault _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) and assuming a distance modulus of 5.63 ( pinsonneault _ et al . _",

    "there is no convincing evidence that these slight discrepancies are related to binarity .",
    "rather , they may be due to relatively large photometric errors in one passband or to physical effects ( _ e.g.,_increased red flux from spots ) unrelated to binarity .",
    "stars rejected as binaries are plotted as filled triangles ; their general propensity to reside above the main sequence is evident .",
    "s93a and jones _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1996 ) provide photometric @xmath12 estimates for all of the stars in table 1 .",
    "we re - examine these for comparison and because of concern that chromospheric activity or starspots might affect the colors of young stars .",
    "we calculated @xmath1 using our @xmath21 values and the relation from soderblom et al .",
    "( 1993b , equation 3 ) : @xmath22 .",
    "temperatures were also derived from our @xmath23 colors using the relation from randich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : @xmath24 .",
    "both of these relations are based on the data from bessell ( 1979 ) , and should provide self - consistent temperatures given self - consistent photospheric colors .",
    "columns 5 , 6 and 9 give the @xmath12 values of s93a , and those derived here from @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt the h@xmath25- and infrared triplet - based chromospheric emission measurements from s93a as stellar activity indicators .",
    "these are the ratio of the flux ( relative to an inactive star of similar color ) in the h@xmath25 and lines relative to the total stellar bolometric flux . given canonical views of a relation between stellar mass and chromospheric emission on the main sequence , it is also of interest to measure the residual h@xmath2 and flux ratios .",
    "that is , we wish to detrend the general relation between stellar mass and activity such that activity differences unrelated to large - scale mass differences can be quantified .",
    "this was done by fitting the h@xmath2 and flux ratios as a function of @xmath20 color temperature with a linear relation values indicated that fits with higher order functions did not yield statistically improved descriptions of the flux ratio - color relations . ] , and subtracting this fitted flux ratio ( computed at a given @xmath16 ) from the measured flux ratio of each star .",
    "the relation for the fitted h@xmath2 flux ratio ( used below ) was found to be @xmath26 .",
    "the relation for the flux ratio was found to be @xmath27 .",
    "we find strong evidence that our @xmath12 values ( hence , assuming self - consistency of the color-@xmath12 relations , the photometric colors ) are affected by activity level .",
    "figure 2 shows the difference between the @xmath19- and @xmath20-based @xmath12 values versus the h@xmath2 flux ratios ( top panel ) and the mass - independent residual h@xmath2 flux ratios ( bottom panel ) .",
    "a relation is seen in both panels , such that the lowest @xmath12 differences are seen predominantly for the lowest flux ratios while the largest @xmath12 differences are seen predominantly for stars having the largest flux ratios . the ordinary linear correlation coefficients are significant above the 99.9% confidence levels for both panels",
    ".    the binary stars ( filled triangles ) behave similarly to the single stars in both panels ; on average , though , the binaries exhibit larger @xmath1 residuals than the single stars . this systematic offset",
    "likely reflects the additional influence of fainter ( hence cooler and redder ) companions on the photometric colors .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , it could suggest that the handful of inactive single stars with significant @xmath12 residuals in the upper left portion of both panels are unrecognized binaries .",
    "significant differences between the @xmath19- and @xmath20-based @xmath1 estimates , the slight propensity for @xmath19 to yield larger temperatures , and the association of these properties with stellar activity seems to be a common property of young stars noted and discussed by others ( _ e.g. ,  _ garcia lopez _ et al . _  1994",
    "; randich _ et al . _  1997",
    "; king 1998 ; soderblom _ et al . _",
    "explanations for these observed properties in young stars are at least twofold :  a ) increased @xmath28-band flux due to boundary layer emission associated with a circumstellar disk ( presumably not applicable for our near - zams pleiads ) , and  b ) increased @xmath17-band flux due to the presence of cool spots .",
    "it is straightforward to associate increased prevalence and surface coverage of spots with increasing activity , and h@xmath2 emission ( used here to quantify activity ) has been associated with accretion of circumstellar material in young stars .",
    "given that the pleiades age ( @xmath29 myr ) is an order of magnitude larger than inferred disk lifetimes for solar - type stars ( skrutskie _ et al . _",
    "1990 ) , spots are the more likely cause of the temperature difference - activity relation in our pleiades sample .    in their recent study of the effects of activity on pleiades",

    "_  ( 1997 ) find that activity specifically the presence of spots and plages may significantly alter photospheric colors .",
    "indeed , they suggest that the resulting changes in color may be a more dominant contributor to the pleiades li spread than line strength differences . additionally , they find that such color variations are both surprising and complex . their empirical solar - based activity models indicated that _ both  _ spots and plages lead to increased @xmath19 colors ; in contrast , their `` best - effort '' theoretical stellar models indicate a decrease in @xmath19 .",
    "sorting out which ( if either ) set of models are appropriate for specific pleiads ( in addition to other empirical details such as specific spot / plage coverage and ratio ) might be further illuminating . because the direction of changes in @xmath20 also flips in their models , stuik et al .",

    "1993 ) .",
    "li abundances for all our pleiads were determined from the measured @xmath18 line strengths and our preferred @xmath12 value . a blending complex lies some 0.4  blueward of the li doublet . in our stars ,",
    "the typical contribution of these blending features is @xmath30 m , which is significantly smaller than typical li line strength of @xmath29 m .",
    "the blending contribution was subtracted following the approach of s93a , who parameterized the contaminating line strength as a function of @xmath19 color . here",
    ", we recast this parameterization as a function of @xmath12 so that differences in our @xmath19- and @xmath20-based temperatures were consistently accounted for in the analysis .",
    "given the @xmath12 values and the corrected li line strengths , abundances were calculated using table 2 from s93a .",
    "this was done by fitting a surface map of the equivalent width - temperature - abundance grid of s93a using high order polynomials .",

    "extrapolation to these temperatures with high order polynomials leads to errantly low abundances by a few tenths of a dex .",
    "to the extent that we are mainly interested in the cooler pleiads and that we are only interested in the differential star - to - star li abundances ( i.e. , large scale abundance morphology with @xmath12 is removed later ) , these known errors are unimportant for the present analysis . in the case of these two stars ( 133 and 470 ) , we simply caution those who would use our absolute abundances , and also note that the few much smaller extrapolations to lower @xmath12 outside the s93a grid are not believed to be affected by any substantial amount . ] .",

    "fourth order fits were also conducted for the data based on the s93a temperatures and our @xmath19-based values .",
    "these fits provide a mean fiducial li abundance at any given @xmath1 to which observed abundances ( calculated assuming the same source of @xmath12 ) can be compared to infer and measure a relative li `` enhancement '' or `` depletion '' for each star as shown in figure 4 .",

    "for @xmath19-based temperatures , the approximation to the fit shown in figure 3 is given by : @xmath34      uncertainties in the li abundances were estimated from those in @xmath1 and equivalent width . here , we are only interested in the internal errors which affect the star - to - star li abundances .",
    "a measure of the internal uncertainties in the @xmath12 estimates is provided by the estimates from the @xmath19 and @xmath20 colors . for the single stars , the difference in the two color - temperatures exhibits a per star standard deviation of 108 k. assuming equal contributions from both @xmath19 and @xmath20",

    "the other significant source of uncertainty is in the li line measurements . for s93a line strengths ( the majority of our sample ) , uncertainties come from their own quality measures : a ( @xmath36 m ) , b ( @xmath37 m ) , c ( @xmath38 m ) , and d ( @xmath39 m ) .",
    "et al . _  ( 1996 ) state that their uncertainties range from 5 - 20 m and depend largely on projected rotational velocity .",

    "we emphasize that for the purpose of looking at the star - to - star li abundance differences in cool pleiads , the effects of @xmath12 errors are minimized .",
    "this is because the movement of a star in the @xmath12-li plane due to @xmath12 errors is very nearly along the cool star depletion trend for @xmath43 k. to take into account this correlation in looking at the _ differential  _ li abundances ( i.e. , the actual values versus an expected value from a fitted trend to the data ) , the abundance errors due to departures in @xmath12 were combined with the slope of the fitted li versus @xmath12 trend at the @xmath12 of each star .",

    "when rotational _ periods _ are considered rather than @xmath9 measurements , a true range of li abundances with rotation is seen in the mass range 0.7 - 0.9 m@xmath7 there are genuine slow rotators with abundances similar to the fast rotators .",
    "thus , there appears to be a range of rotation at all abundances .",
    "hence , p@xmath58 is essential to study the true correlation .",
    "rapid rotation affects the structure of a star and hence the derived mass at a given @xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the structural effects of rotation would alter a star s color such that rapidly rotating objects would be redder , hence perceived as cooler , and thus be assigned a lower mass .",
    "we therefore examined the abundances as a function of mass rather than effective temperature .    to investigate this issue , it was necessary to construct stellar models for different disk lifetimes ( @xcite ) .",
    "we ran models for @xmath59 = 5@xmath60 and 10@xmath60 to represent fast rotators and the slow rotators .",
    "the rotation - corrected masses were derived by interpolation in the models across effective temperature and rotation velocity for different disk lifetimes .",
    "we found that the percent change in mass is small ( 5% ) even for the most rapidly rotating star in the pleiades ( 1883 , @xmath54=140 km s@xmath52 ) .",
    "the change is between 1% and 2% for stars with @xmath9 in the 50 - 100 km s@xmath52 , and @xmath61% for @xmath62 50 km s@xmath52 .",
    "these small alterations fail to eliminate the li dispersion , which sets in at m@xmath630.9 m@xmath7 in the li - mass plane .",
    "thus , the structural effects of rotation on the derived mass - temperature relation are not large enough to account for the pleiades li abundance dispersion .",
    "these results differ with those of martin & claret ( 1996 ) , who also explored the structural effects of rotation and found enhanced li abundances for stars with high initial angular momentum .",
    "this is not seen in our models , which predict small rotational structure effects on the pleiades li abundances , similar to the models of pinsonneault et al .",
    "mendes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have noted the conflict between the results of martin & claret ( 1996 ) and pinsonneault et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , and considered the hydrostatic effects of rotation on stellar structure and li depletion using their own stellar models .",
    "their results are in agreement with pinsonneault et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , and they too find that hydrostatic effects are too small to explain the observed li abundance spread in the pleiades .",
    "since the large pleiades li spread is in such a young cluster , one may wonder if its long - sought explanation is related to stellar activity . additionally , since rotation and activity are well - correlated , a li - activity relation may be masquerading as a li - rotation relation instead .",
    "here , we discuss if magnetic activity indicators such as chromospheric emission ( ce ) are correlated with the li abundance .",
    "several studies have pointed out that activity is correlated with the li abundance ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there have also been some studies speculating that ce affects the _ apparent _ abundance of li ( e.g. , @xcite ) and hence may be at least partly responsible for the dispersion .",
    "figure 8 contains our results , and shows the @xmath16-based differential li abundances versus the infrared triplet fluxes ( top panel ) and residual fluxes ( bottom panel ) .",
    "a relation is seen in both panels , such that the lowest log n(li ) differences are seen predominantly for the lowest flux ratios while the largest log n(li ) differences are seen predominantly for stars having the largest flux ratios . the ordinary correlation coefficients are significant at the 99.7% and @xmath64% confidence levels for the chromospheric ca fluxes and residual fluxes , suggesting a significant relation between chromospheric activity differences and li abundance differences ( though not necessarily causal ) .",
    "important clues to the cause of the pleiades li abundance scatter can be found from examination of other elements not destroyed in stellar interiors like @xmath65li .",
    "variations in such abundances may signal effects other than differential li processing , and perhaps point to an illusory difference caused by inadequate treatment of line formation .",
    "one of the most useful features for this purpose is the @xmath66 line .",
    "the usefulness of this feature is two - fold .",
    "first , there is the similarity in electronic configuration with the atom and the fact that this particular k transition and the @xmath18 are both neutral resonance features .",
    "second , the interplay of abundance and ionization effects leads to the happy circumstance that the line strengths of these two features are comparable in pleiades dwarfs .",
    "thus , line formation for both features should be similar in many respects .",
    "the line strengths were taken from s93a and jones _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) .",
    "these were then plotted versus @xmath12 as derived from both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the relation was well fit by a 4th order legendre polynomial approximated by the relation : @xmath67 for the @xmath15 colors and by the relation : @xmath68 for the @xmath16 colors .",
    "these fits showed considerable scatter ",
    "the line strength dispersion was @xmath69 m , which is considerably larger ( and statistically significant ) than even the maximum equivalent width errors estimated by s93a .",
    "so scatter is present in the potassium data as well .",
    "differential equivalent widths ( [ observed@xmath70fitted]/fitted ) are plotted against the differential li abundances in figure 9 .",
    "a correlation between the values is present , though with considerable scatter . the one - sided correlation coefficients are significant at the 99.0 and 98.3% confidence levels for the @xmath19 and @xmath20-based results .",
    "such a correlation ( of whatever magnitude ) , however , may arise not from some physical mechanism ; instead , it may simply reflect correlated measurement errors .    like the differential li abundances , the differential line strengths are correlated with activity measure .",
    "figure 10 shows the differential equivalent width versus the fluxes ( top panel ) and residual fluxes ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the correlations are analogous to those seen for the differential li abundances in figure 8 , and are significant at the @xmath71% ( top panel ) and @xmath72% ( bottom panel ) confidence levels .      to examine the possibility of correlated measurement errors , we considered the line strengths of the @xmath736717 feature taken from s93a .",
    "these were fitted against @xmath12 in the same manner as the equivalent widths .",
    "the relations are given by : @xmath74 for the @xmath15 colors and by @xmath75 for the @xmath16 colors .",
    "the scatter associated with these fits is @xmath76 m , which is consistent with the s93a uncertainties .",
    "interestingly , unlike li and k , there is no evidence for scatter in the calcium data above the measurement uncertainties .",
    "differential equivalent widths are plotted against the differential li abundances in figure 11 .",
    "the relation is flat . unlike k",
    ", there is no significant correlation the ordinary correlation coefficients are significant at only the @xmath77% confidence level .",
    "this indicates to us that the correlated scatter in li and k line strengths is not due to measurement errors .",
    "rather , we suggest that some physical mechanism affecting the details of line formation not included in standard lte model photosphere analyses is the cause . such a mechanism , if having star - to - star differences , may be the dominant source of the li abundance scatter in pleiades dwarfs . since activity evinces such differences , it may naturally provide such a mechanism .    in an important theoretical study , stuik _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1997 ) have urged similar caution in regarding pleiades li scatter as solely due to genuine abundance differences .",
    "these authors consider the photospheric effects of activity on pleiades and line strengths by modeling surface spots and plages .",
    "they can neither exclude nor confirm these particular manifestations of magnetic activity as the cause of the problematic and important variations in cool pleiads .",
    "their extensive efforts , though , do open the door for future improvement .",
    "first , it seems important to establish whether their empirical solar - based spot / plage models or their `` best - effort '' theoretical stellar models are more nearly correct , and if one or the other model set is indeed applicable to all pleiads since the two model sets produce color and line strength changes opposite in sign .",
    "second , stuik _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1997 ) note that their radiative equilibrium and mixed activity calculations depart from observations with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "as they acknowledge , such disparities may signal other effects not yet considered : uv `` line haze '' , which may depend on the presence and structure of an overlying chromosphere , impacting the details of line formation ; unknown properties and effects of pleiads granulation patterns ; and the influence of so - called solar - like `` abnormal granulation '' within plages .",
    "third , other sources of non - thermal heating of the photosphere by chromospheric ` activity ' may need to be considered . finally , simply relating colors or effective temperatures ( from color-@xmath12 conversions ) of pleaids having different activity levels may be more problematic than realized .",
    "houdebine & doyle ( 1995 ; hd95 ) demonstrate that formation of the @xmath736707 line is sensitive to activity in m dwarfs .",
    "the extent of these effects depends on the relative coverage of plages and spots .",
    "note the particular importance of the role of ionization in reducing the resonance line s optical depth . in late g and",
    "k dwarfs like those showing scatter in the pleiades , star - to - star variations in departures of both photoionisation and collisional ionization from that predicted by model photospheres might introduce significant star - to - star variations in the derived li abundance .",
    "interestingly , king et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find element - to - element abundance differences in two cool ( @xmath78 k ) pleiades dwarfs and a similarly cool ngc 2264 pms member which are ionization potential dependent .",
    "we suggest that current evidence may implicate non - photospheric ionization differences as a likely source of star - to - star li variations in the pleiades .",
    "variations in abundances of other elements can affect stellar li depletion via the effects of stellar structure on pms li burning .",
    "for example , figure 3 of chaboyer , demarque , & pinsonneault ( 1995 ) , indicates that very small metal abundance differences of , say , 0.03 dex lead to substantial ( @xmath79 dex ) differences in pms li burning for @xmath80 k.    extant studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) of pleiades f- and g - star _ iron  _ abundances ( which can not simply be equated with `` metallicity '' when it comes to pms li depletion ; @xcite ) suggest no intrinsic scatter larger than 0.06 - 0.10 dex .",
    "the photometric scatter of the single stars in the color - magnitude diagram might allow a metallicity ( or , perhaps more properly , those elements which are dominant electron donors in the stellar photospheres ) spread of 0.05 dex .",
    "while small , these constraints would still permit substantial li abundance spreads for _ cool  _ pleiads .",
    "additionally , abundances of elements which may have a large impact on pms li depletion but little effect on atmospheric opacity ( e.g. , oxygen ) have yet to be determined in cool pleiades dwarfs .",
    "however , the li spread in the pleiades extends to @xmath12 values substantially hotter than @xmath81 k. at hotter @xmath12 values , model pms li - burning is less sensitive to metallicity .",
    "for example , in the range 5000 - 5200 k , the observed li abundance spread would require `` metallicity '' differences approaching a factor of two .",
    "such spreads would be surprising indeed , and not expected based on the limited results of extant fe analyses of hotter cluster dwarfs .",
    "abundance differences ( of a large number of elements ) of this size would not be difficult to exclude with good quality spectra as part of future studies .",
    "ventura et al .  (",
    "1998 ) have recently investigated the effects of magnetic fields in stellar models and pms li depletion .",
    "they find that even small fields are able to inhibit convection , and thus pms li depletion .",
    "they suggest that a dynamo generated magnetic field linked to rotational velocity ( thus , presumably yielding an association between activity and rotation given conventional wisdom ) would result in zams star - to - star li variations that mirror differences in star - to - star rotational ( and presumably activity ) differences . as these authors admit , the fits of their magnetic models to the li-@xmath12 morphology and significant scatter of the pleiades observations are not `` perfect '' or `` definitive '' ; however , the qualitative agreement and ability to produce star - to - star scatter and general relations between li abundance and rotation and activity are encouraging . continued observations ( especially detailed spectroscopic abundance determinations of various elements in numerous pleiads ) and theoretical work will be needed to establish the degree to which the pleiades li spread is illusory or real and , if the latter , its cause(s ) .",
    "the very large dispersion in li abundances at fixed @xmath12 in cool ( @xmath82 k ) pleiads is a fundamental challenge for stellar evolution because standard stellar models of uniform age and abundance are unable to reproduce it . a variety of mechanisms ( rotation , activity , magnetic fields , and incomplete knowledge of line formation ) have been proposed to account for this scatter . here",
    ", we construct a sample of likely single pleiads and consider this problem with :  a ) differential li abundances relative to a mean @xmath12 trend  b ) rotational periods instead of projected rotational velocities  c ) chromospheric emission indicators , and  d ) line strengths of other elements .",
    "we calculated @xmath12 values from both @xmath19 and @xmath20 on a self - consistent scale based on the calibrations of bessell ( 1979 ) .",
    "we find differences in the two @xmath12 values and these are significantly correlated with both general activity level and with differences in activity , suggesting that surface inhomogeneities may noticeably affect stellar colors .",
    "our results are consistent with a growing body of evidence of significant differences between @xmath19- and @xmath20-based @xmath12 values , a propensity for @xmath19 to yield larger @xmath12 values , and a relation of these characteristics with activity in young stars from 5 myr old pms stars in ngc 2264 ( soderblom et al .",
    "1999 ) to pms stars in the 30 myr old ic 2602 ( randich et al .",
    "1997 ) to zams stars in the @xmath29 myr old pleiades .",
    "however , the similarity between the sensitivity of the derived li abundance to @xmath12 and the clusters physical li-@xmath12 morphology means that even substantial @xmath12 errors are not a significant source of star - to - star li scatter . nor are observational errors .",
    "comparison of the scatter in the differential li abundances with errors from @xmath12 and line strength uncertainties indicates an infinitesimal probability that the observed scatter occurs by chance .",
    "we find significant scatter in the li abundances below @xmath83 k ; it is significantly larger , though , below @xmath84 k. statistical analysis fails to support previous claims of smaller scatter in the late k dwarfs relative to the late g and early - mid k dwarfs .    there is a spread of li abundance at low @xmath9 , whereas the rapid _ projected  _ rotators tend to have larger differential li abundances in the range @xmath50 .",
    "however , use of photometric rotation periods ( free from uncertainties in the inclination angle @xmath49 ) indicates there is _ not  _ a one - to - one mapping between differential li abundance and rotation .",
    "the stars 263 , 320 , and 1124 are examples of stars with li excesses but slow rotation ( p@xmath85 d ) .",
    "in contrast to previous claims based on @xmath9 , the rotation periods indicate a true range of li abundance with rotation in the mass bin 0.7 - 0.9 m@xmath7 .    using the theoretical framework of krishnamurthi",
    "( 1997 ) , we constructed stellar models to investigate the hydrostatic effects of rotation on stellar structure and pms li burning .",
    "as shown in figure 8 , these models fail to account for the pleiades li dispersion , which is in agreement with the independent conclusions of mendes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we find that the star - to - star differences in pleiades li abundances are correlated with activity differences , as measured from infrared triplet flux ratios , at a statistically significant level .",
    "moreover , the li differences are significantly correlated with differences in the strengths of the @xmath737699 resonance feature .",
    "this seems to not be due to correlated measurement errors since the li differences show no correlation with the @xmath736717 line strength residuals .",
    "this is a significant result given similarities in the li and k feature s atomic properties and line strengths .",
    "we suggest that incomplete treatment of line formation , related to activity differences , plays a significant role in the li dispersion i.e. , that part of the dispersion is illusory .",
    "as emphasized by houdebine & doyle ( 1995 ) , the formation of the feature is sensitive to ionization conditions .",
    "if chromospheric activity variations can produce significant variations in photo- and collisional - ionization in the line formation region not accounted for by lte analyses using model photospheres , this may lead to errors in the inferred abundance .",
    "relatedly , we note the results of king _ et al . _  ( 1999 ) who found ionization potential - dependent effects in the elemental abundances of two cool ( @xmath12 ) pleiads and a similarly cool ngc 2264 pms star .",
    "if such conjecture is correct , we expect that somewhat older ( less active ) cluster stars will exhibit less li dispersion .",
    "this seems to be the case for the @xmath86 myr old hyades cluster ( thorburn et al .",
    "1993 ) and perhaps also for the mid - g to mid - k stars in m34 ( jones et al .",
    "these clusters still exhibit scatter , and this may be real and due to differences in depletion from structural effects of rotation ( mendes et al .",
    "1999 ) , magnetic fields ( ventura et al .",
    "1998 ) , small metallicity variations (  5.1 ) , main sequence depletion due to angular momentum transport from spin - down ( pinsonneault et al .  1990 ; charbonnel et al .  1992 ) or a planetary companion ( cochran et al .  1997 ) , and photospheric accretion of circumstellar / planetary material ( alexander 1967 ; gonzalez 1998 ) .",
    "the amount of scatter expected in even older clusters is less clear . if , e.g. , rotationally - induced mixing acts over longer timescales then the scatter may well increase again",
    "; indeed , the substantial li scatter in m67 solar - type stars observed by jones et al .",
    "( 1999 ) could indicate that this is the case .",
    "these authors called attention to the possible pattern of very large li scatter in young clusters , considerably reduced scatter in intermediate - age clusters , and increased scatter in older clusters . in the scenario we envision , variations in activity - regulated ionization of the atom may be responsible for the majority of ( mostly illusory ) star - to - star li differences in near - zams and younger stars ; of course , this does not exclude a ( lesser ) role from other variable mechanisms influencing pms li burning .",
    "if the decline in the activity level of intermediate - age stars reduces the importance of variable ionization , then the ( smaller ) li scatter in these stars could arise from variations in pms li burning due to , e.g. , the hydrostatic effects of rotation on stellar structure , inhibition of convection by magnetic fields , and small metallicity variations ; additional contributions may come from processes just beginning to become effective for zams stars such as rotationally - induced mixing and planetary / circumstellar accretion . in older stars such as m67 ,",
    "the increase in scatter ( and overall li depletion ) is then a product of processes efficiently acting on the main - sequence proper such as rotationally - induced mixing and/or photospheric accretion .",
    "distinguishing specific mechanisms and their relative importance for li depletion and scatter at a given age will require continuing observational and theoretical efforts .",
    "important advances on the theoretical front are at least three - fold :  continued investigation of the role of magnetic fields in pms li depletion , realistic model atmospheres which include chromospheres , and detailed nlte abundance calculations which employ these to extend extant sophisticated modeling attempts ( e.g. , stuik _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) . on the observational front ,",
    "continued observations of li in a variety of clusters spanning a range in age and metallicity are needed .",
    "we believe that particularly important observational work to be accomplished includes the determination of photometric periods in more cluster stars , detailed abundances of numerous elements ( in particular , using both ionization sensitive and ionization insensitive features and elements ) in cluster stars , quantification of even small `` metal '' ( not just fe ) abundance spreads in cluster stars , and the association between planetary systems and parent star li and light metal abundances .",
