    "modern human societies are supported by various functional networks , such as power grids , the internet , road systems , and corporate transaction networks @xcite .",
    "since the function of a network is guaranteed by its global connectivity , a decomposition of the network into disconnected components by failures on network elements ( nodes or links ) might induce the breakdown of the function , which causes a fatal damage to our daily life .",
    "it is thus crucial to elucidate what type of network topology is resilient to failures . in this context",
    ", the vulnerability of complex networks against random failures and targeted attacks has been extensively studied @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "failed nodes are removed from a network at the same time .",
    "in addition to such simultaneous failures , many of actual breakdowns are driven by a chain of failures triggered by initial failures of a single or a few nodes .",
    "initial failures and subsequent avalanche of failures in functional networks are often induced by loads exceeding node capacities .",
    "for instance , a bankruptcy of an insolvent company and subsequent chain bankruptcies due to redistributed debts of the bankrupt company can be regarded as a process of such _ cascading overload failures _ in a corporate transaction network .    in order to describe how networks lose their global connectivity by cascading overload failures , motter and lai proposed a model in which the load at a node is given by the betweenness centrality of the node @xcite .",
    "their model predicts that the initial removal of the highest degree ( or highest load ) node leads a large scale cascade and scale - free networks are more fragile against cascading overload failures than homogeneous networks . the vulnerability of scale - free networks has also been found in other models of cascading failures @xcite . in these models ,",
    "overload failures are caused by _ non - fluctuating _ loads determined uniquely by the network structure that exceed the capacity of each node .",
    "it is , however , quite general that the load on a node fluctuates temporally @xcite .",
    "an overload failure takes place when an instantaneous value of fluctuating load exceeds the capacity , as in the cases of river flooding or financial collapse in a country @xcite .",
    "the property of cascading overload failures induced by _ extreme events _ might be largely different from that by non - fluctuating loads .",

    "they calculated the overload probability that the number of random walkers on a node exceeds the predetermined node capacity .",
    "moreover , applying this theory , the network robustness against non - cascading overload failures has been studied , in which nodes are simultaneously removed once according to the overload probability @xcite . although these theories take into account the temporal fluctuations of loads , cascade processes triggered by the initial overload failures have not been considered . in this paper",

    "in a functional network , some sort of  flow \" is often required to realize its functionality , and at the same time the flow plays a role of a  load \" in the network , such as electric current in a power grid or packet transfer on the internet .",
    "the relation between the average and fluctuation of flow in such networks has been investigated empirically and theoretically @xcite .",
    "these studies elucidated that the flux fluctuations at a node have the same scaling behavior with the fluctuations of the number of random walkers on the node .",

    "modeled fluctuating loads by random walkers moving on a network @xcite , where the number of walkers indicates the amount of loads . the stationary probability to find a random walker on a node of degree @xmath1 in a connected and undirected network with @xmath3 links",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath4 using this relation , the probability @xmath5 that @xmath6 walkers are observed on a node of degree @xmath1 is presented by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total number of walkers in the network .",
    "this leads a natural definition of the node capacity @xmath9 of a node of degree @xmath1 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the average and the standard deviation of the binomial distribution @xmath5 , which are given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , and @xmath15 is a real positive parameter which characterizes the node tolerance to load . since the overload probability @xmath16 of a node of degree @xmath1 is the probability of @xmath6 to exceed @xmath9 , @xmath16 is given by summing up the distribution function eq .",
    "( [ eq : binom ] ) over @xmath6 larger than @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we have @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the regularized incomplete beta function @xcite and @xmath19 is the greatest integer not greater than @xmath20 .",
    "it is important to pay attention to the fact that the overload probability is a decreasing function of degree @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "based on the above overload probability , we model the cascade process of overload failures as follows :    \\(i ) prepare an initial connected , uncorrelated , and undirected network @xmath21 with @xmath22 nodes and @xmath3 links , in which @xmath8 random walkers exist , and determine the capacity @xmath9 of each node according to eq .",

    "\\(iv ) repeat ( ii ) and ( iii ) until no node is removed in the procedure ( iii ) .    in the procedure ( ii ) , the total load @xmath23 is reduced in accordance with the reduction of the network size . in actual cases of cascading failures ,",
    "the total load is often reduced to some extent during a cascade process to prevent the breakdown of the network function . for instance , when a problem arises in a power supply system due to a natural disaster , the temporary restriction of electricity use is sometimes introduced to avoid a large - scale breakdown of the power grid , as in the case of the tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011 @xcite . in addition , when a company goes bankrupt , a large - scale chain bankruptcy could be prevented by the reduction of the total debt ( loads ) on the transaction network by means of , for example , a special low - interest lending facilities for companies having business relationships with the bankrupt company or the injection of taxpayers money . the quantity @xmath23 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtau ] ) represents such a reduction of the total load during the cascade process .",
    "the exponent @xmath27 characterizes how quickly the total load decreases with decreasing the network size , which we call hereafter the load reduction parameter .",
    "although the initial network @xmath21 is connected , the network @xmath24 at cascade step @xmath2 is not necessarily connected . for an unconnected network @xmath24",
    ", we assume that @xmath23 random walkers are distributed to components in proportion to the numbers of links in these components .",
    "namely , the load allocated to the @xmath28-th component is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of links in the @xmath28-th component .",
    "in the procedure ( iii ) , the overload probability during the cascade process can not be calculated straightforwardly by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fwk ] ) .",
    "first , the degree @xmath1 of a node in the network @xmath24 at step @xmath2 is not the same as its initial degree @xmath0 .",
    "since the probability to find a random walker on a node in @xmath24 is a function of the present degree @xmath1 of the node while the node capacity is determined by its initial degree @xmath0 , the overload probability is presented by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fwk ] ) with replacing @xmath9 by @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , when the network @xmath24 is unconnected , the overload probability must be calculated in each component , because random walkers in a component can not move beyond the component .",
    "therefore , the overload probability of a node of degree @xmath1 , whose initial degree is @xmath0 , in the @xmath28-th component is given by @xmath32 where @xmath30 and @xmath33 are again the total number of links and the number of random walkers in the @xmath28-th component of @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the robustness of a network against cascading overload failures described above is evaluated by the relative size of the giant component @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of nodes in the largest component of the network @xmath36 at the final stage of the cascade process .",
    "more specifically , the robustness of the network is measured by the load reduction parameter @xmath37 above which the relative size @xmath38 becomes finite .",
    "a network providing a smaller @xmath37 can be regarded to be more robust in the sense that there exists a giant component even if the total load is slowly reduced in accordance with the reduction of the network size during the cascade process .",
    "in order to assess the robustness of a network , we calculate the relative size @xmath39 of the giant component in the network @xmath24 at cascade step @xmath2 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath39 requires information on the load @xmath33 to obtain the overload probability @xmath40 for each component .",
    "it is , however , difficult to find an analytical expression of @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we assume that random walkers can jump to other components with a small probability , which enables us to estimate the stationary probability to find a walker on a node of degree @xmath1 by @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 , and the overload probability by @xmath43 instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftaualpha ] ) .",
    "this simplification does not largely change the overload probability if the number of links in a component is large enough .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the probability that @xmath6 walkers are found on a degree-@xmath1 node in the @xmath28-th component containing @xmath33 walkers is written as @xmath44 if random walkers are confined in the component .",
    "the average and the standard deviation of this binomial distribution function of @xmath6 are @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , where we used eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtaualpha ] ) and the relation @xmath42 . in the case that random walkers are allowed to jump between components , on the other hand , the probability to find @xmath6 walkers on a degree-@xmath1 node is given by @xmath47 .",
    "the average @xmath48 of this distribution function coincides with the average @xmath11 of @xmath49 .",
    "although the standard deviation @xmath50 of @xmath47 is larger than @xmath12 of @xmath49 , @xmath51 is not very different from @xmath12 if @xmath30 ( thus @xmath26 ) is large enough .",
    "therefore , both distribution functions @xmath49 and @xmath47 with the same average and similar widths are close to each other . because of this similarity , @xmath52 that leads eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftaualpha ] ) can be approximated by @xmath53 giving eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftau ] ) .",
    "we calculate the relative size @xmath39 of the giant component by using the generating function method @xcite . to this end , here we slightly modify the rule of the procedure ( ii ) described in sec .",
    "ii so that overloaded nodes are not removed but left in the system as zero - degree nodes for which random walkers never visit",
    ". this does not influence any results in this work , except that the total number of nodes in @xmath24 remains constant at @xmath22 , which makes the theoretical treatment easier . in spite of this modification",
    ", we will continue to use the expression  remove a node \" for simplicity , but this actually means ",
    "remove all links from a node \" .",
    "the generating function method then enables us to calculate @xmath39 if the network @xmath24 is uncorrelated and the degree distribution function @xmath54 of @xmath24 is given . in order to estimate @xmath54",
    ", we introduce the probability @xmath55 that a randomly chosen node has the degree @xmath1 and the initial degree @xmath0 .",

    "therefore , the conditional probability is presented by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the average degree of @xmath24 , and @xmath66 is written as @xmath67 which is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the probability @xmath55 is equal to the probability that a randomly chosen node from @xmath68 has the initial degree @xmath0 and the degree of this node becomes @xmath1 during the cascade from @xmath68 to @xmath24 .",

    "according to this work , we newly define the load @xmath152 of the node @xmath153 by @xmath154 where @xmath144 is a set of @xmath72 node pairs that are randomly selected from @xmath155 node pairs in @xmath21 excluding the node @xmath153 , @xmath156 is the total number of shortest paths between the pair @xmath157 in @xmath144 , and @xmath158 is the number of those paths that pass through @xmath153 . since the quantity represented by the right - hand side of eq .",

    "is strongly correlated to the degree @xmath163 in an uncorrelated network @xcite , the partial betweenness centrality of a node is also expected to have a correlation with the degree of the node .",
    "in fact , we have confirmed numerically that two distribution functions @xmath162 and @xmath164 of load on the nodes @xmath153 and @xmath165 which have the same degree are close to each other .",
    "therefore , we can define the degree - dependent load distribution @xmath146 for the partial betweenness centrality model , which corresponds to the load distribution @xmath5 given by eq .",

    ", the overload probability is defined as the probability that the load of a node of degree @xmath1 exceeds its capacity @xmath9 , which is calculated by @xmath167 .",
    "since @xmath146 depends on @xmath72 , we denote this overload probability by @xmath147 instead of @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows the degree dependence of @xmath147 for several values of the node tolerance parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we see that the overload probability @xmath147 is a decreasing function of @xmath1 for any @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that sf networks are robust also against cascading overload failures induced by fluctuating shortest - path flow .",
    "it is not surprising that the degree dependences of @xmath16 and @xmath147 show a similar tendency , because it has been reported that the couplings between the fluctuations and the average of the number of random walkers and the partial betweenness centrality on individual nodes obeys the same scaling law @xcite .",
    "we can also consider a situation that cascading failures are caused by _ non - fluctuating _",
    "loads by random walkers . in this case , an overload failure occurs when the average number of walkers @xmath168 on a node of degree @xmath1 exceeds the node capacity depending on @xmath166 , where @xmath8 is the total number of walkers and @xmath3 is the number of links in the initial network . since @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath1 and the degree of a node correlates closely with the betweenness centrality of the node @xcite , the property of cascading failures induced by non - fluctuating random walking loads is essentially the same as that by loads of the betweenness centrality @xcite",
    ". therefore , sf networks are fragile to such cascading failures .",
    "all the above arguments can be summarized as shown in table [ table:1 ] . from this table",
    ", we can conclude that the robustness of sf networks in our model is a consequence of the property that failures are caused by extreme values of fluctuating loads , but not concerned with the random walk behavior of loads .",

    "we have studied the robustness of scale - free ( sf ) networks against cascading overload failures induced by extreme values of fluctuating loads that exceed the node capacities . in our model , temporally fluctuating loads are treated as random walkers on a network , for which the stationary overload probability has been studied by kishore _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . at the first stage of the cascade",
    ", nodes are removed from the initial network with this overload probability , and the redistribution of loads in the damaged network causes iteratively subsequent failures according to the updated overload probability until no node is expected to be removed . during the cascade process",
    ", the total load is reduced in response to the decrease of the number of links in the network under the cascade .",
    "how quickly the total load is reduced is characterized by the load reduction parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the robustness of a network is measured by the critical load reduction parameter @xmath37 above which the relative size @xmath38 of the giant component at the final cascade stage is finite .",
    "we present a formulation to calculate @xmath38 by using the master equation for the probability @xmath55 of a node in the network @xmath24 at cascade step @xmath2 to have the present degree @xmath1 and the initial degree @xmath0 and by applying the generating function method .",
    "our results for sf networks with degree distribution @xmath169 at large @xmath1 show that @xmath37 increases with the exponent @xmath89 , which implies that sf networks are robust against cascading overload failures in our model as opposed to previous works @xcite .",
    "the robustness of sf networks is explained by the property of the overload probability of being a decreasing function of the degree , which is a consequence of the load fluctuations but not concerned with the random walk behavior of loads .    in our model , the total load does not fluctuate throughout the cascade process though the local load on a node fluctuates .",
    "if the total load also fluctuates temporally and the time scale of the fluctuation is faster than that of the cascade process , the overload probability must be different from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fwk ] ) or ( [ eq : ftau ] ) .",
    "however , we can expect that the overload probability remains to be a decreasing function of the degree if the magnitude of the total load fluctuation @xmath170 is much smaller than the average total load @xmath171 , which guarantees the robustness of sf networks to cascading overload failures . this is because the standard deviation @xmath12 of the fluctuating load @xmath6 on a node of degree @xmath1 is proportional to the square root of the average load @xmath11 if @xmath172 , as in the case of the present work .",
    "it has , however , been reported that @xmath12 becomes proportional to @xmath166 when @xmath173 approaches to @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "the change in the property of the load fluctuations may alter drastically the degree dependence of the overload probability and hence the robustness of networks .",
    "it is thus important to study how robust sf networks are against cascading failures under large fluctuations of the total load .",
    "furthermore , although we present the formulation to calculate the relative size of the giant component @xmath38 in this work , an analytical expression for the critical load reduction parameter @xmath37 is not found .",
    "in addition to solving this problem , the identification of the universality class of the present model is also a subject for future work .",
