    "in order to simplify the calculations and  without loss of generality  to make the renormalization procedure more transparent , we suppress the complicated spin and chiral structure of baryon chiral perturbation theory and restrict ourselves to the toy model lagrangian @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are scalar particles with masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
