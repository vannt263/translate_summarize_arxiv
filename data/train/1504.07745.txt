    "we seek explicit integral expressions for real - valued solutions of the neumann / dirichlet problem for the following two conductivity equations , considered in a bounded simply connected domain @xmath3 of the right half - plane @xmath4 , @xmath5 for the particular case of conductivity @xmath0 , @xmath6 . for a general conductivity @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the two equations are conjugate in the following sense .",
    "if the function @xmath9 satisfies the first equation in ( [ cond - eq ] ) then the differential form @xmath10 is closed , so by applying poincar theorem in the simply connected @xmath3 , there exists a function @xmath11 such that @xmath12 then , @xmath11 solves the second equation in ( [ cond - eq ] ) .",
    "conversely , for such a @xmath11 , the differential form @xmath13 is closed and there exists a function @xmath9 that satisfies ( [ cr ] ) and the first equation in ( [ cond - eq ] ) . moreover ,",
    "letting @xmath14 we have that ( [ cr ] ) is equivalent to the so - called conjugate beltrami equation , @xmath15 for the complex - valued function @xmath16 in @xmath3 .",
    "this equation differs substantially from the classical and extensively studied beltrami equation @xmath17 .",
    "the link between the conductivity equations ( [ cond - eq ] ) and ( [ belt - conj ] ) was used in @xcite to investigate the dirichlet to neumann map . for a detailed study of the conjugate beltrami equation ( [ belt - conj ] )",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "when @xmath18 , the equations in ( [ cond - eq ] ) reduce to the laplace equation and ( [ cr ] ) to the cauchy - riemann equations . when @xmath19 differs from 1 , we may speak , by analogy , of a @xmath19-harmonic function @xmath9 and a @xmath20-holomorphic function @xmath21 . for",
    "the conductivity @xmath0 , @xmath22 , the equations in ( [ cond - eq ] ) rewrite as @xmath23\\label{grad - s } \\delta v-\\frac{p}{x}\\partial_{x } v=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these equations are particular case of the general elliptic equation @xmath24 which is the topic of the so - called generalized axially symmetric potential theory ( gaspt ) , see @xcite .",
    "the name comes from the relation with the laplacian in spaces of higher dimensions .",
    "for instance , let @xmath25 denotes the usual cylindrical coordinates in @xmath26 , @xmath3 be a domain in the @xmath27-plane , and @xmath28 be the domain obtained by rotation of @xmath3 about the @xmath29-axis .",
    "then , @xmath30 is a solution of @xmath31 in @xmath3 if and only if @xmath30 is harmonic in @xmath32 .",
    "actually , a similar relation holds for the more general equation ( [ ernst ] ) when @xmath22 . indeed , if @xmath33 and @xmath34 then one checks easily that @xmath35 when considering a domain @xmath3 with some simple geometry , this link with the laplacian allows one to get explicit bases of solutions via the method of separation of variables .",
    "for instance , toroidal harmonics ( i.e. legendre functions with half - integer degrees , see e.g. @xcite ) give a complete set of solutions to ( [ gaspt ] ) when @xmath36 , cf .",
    "the fact that generalized legendre functions can be used to solve ( [ gaspt ] ) for complex values of @xmath37 appears in @xcite .",
    "the gaspt theory has been investigated by many authors , among whom weinstein @xcite , vekua @xcite , gilbert @xcite , henrici @xcite , mackie @xcite , ranger @xcite . equation ( [ gaspt ] ) is related to a variety of problems in physics . in particular , when @xmath38 , equation ( [ ernst ] ) can be interpreted as the linearized version of the ernst equation in the case of a static spacetime . in @xcite ,",
    "this equation was studied in the unbounded domain consisting of the exterior of the real segment @xmath39 in the right half - plane @xmath40 and was related to the relativistic gravitational field produced by a rotating disk of matter .",
    "equation ( [ grad - s ] ) with @xmath38 is related to the behavior of plasma in a tokamak .",
    "the goal of this device , which has a toroidal geometry , is to control location of the plasma in its chamber by applying magnetic fields on the boundary . from an assumption of axial symmetry",
    ", the problem is reduced to a plane section .",
    "then , it follows from the grad - shafranov equation , a second - order elliptic nonlinear partial differential equation , see @xcite , that the magnetic flux in the vacuum between the plasma and the circular boundary of the chamber satisfies the homogeneous equation ( [ grad - s ] ) .",
    "note , that in this instance , the conductivity equation ( [ grad - s ] ) takes place in an annular domain , that is a doubly connected domain .",
    "another interesting feature of equation ( [ gaspt ] ) is that it satisfies recurrence and symmetry relations with respect to the coefficient @xmath37 .",
    "namely , denoting by ( @xmath41 ) the equation ( [ gaspt ] ) , the following holds : @xmath42 @xmath43 see e.g. @xcite .",
    "finally , note that , since equation ( [ gaspt ] ) is elliptic , we know , by general results , see e.g. @xcite , that the dirichlet problem with datas on the boundary @xmath44 of the domain has a unique solution , which is @xmath45 in @xmath3 .    in the present paper , we will stick , for simplicity , to the case of a domain @xmath3 being the open disk @xmath46 , lying in the right half - plane @xmath40 , with @xmath47 a point on the positive real axis .",
    "as briefly explained at the end of section [ rh ] , the approach used to derive our integral representations could be adapted to a general jordan domain @xmath3 in @xmath40 bounded by a smooth curve .",
    "the first results of our study are the following theorems [ expl - even ] and [ expl - odd ] , which give explicit integral representations for the solutions of equation ( [ gaspt ] ) when @xmath37 is an even and odd negative integer respectively .",
    "the method of proof follows the general scheme of the so - called unified transform method , see @xcite .",
    "it uses a lax pair , from which one may define a function @xmath48 depending on a spectral parameter @xmath49 , and which can be characterized as the solution of a specific singular riemann - hilbert problem in the @xmath49-plane .",
    "solving this riemann - hilbert problem leads to the seeked integral representations .",
    "in the sequel , for @xmath29 inside the disk @xmath50 , we denote by @xmath51 the point on the circle @xmath52 which has the same imaginary part as @xmath29 and lies to its right .

    "the square root in the denominator has a branch cut along the segment @xmath73 .",
    "integration starts at @xmath51 where the square root is taken to be positive , and its determination is chosen so that it remains continuous along the path of integration .",
    "the function @xmath61 is explicitly given in terms of the tangential and normal derivatives @xmath54 and @xmath55 and their derivatives of order up to @xmath60 along the boundary @xmath56 .",
    "it can be written as a sum , @xmath74 see ( [ def - j0])([d23 ] ) for a precise definition of @xmath61 .",
    "the path of integration in the above integral is the subarc from @xmath51 to @xmath49 on @xmath56 .",

    "the definitions of @xmath79 and the differential form @xmath80 involve the square root @xmath81 with a branch cut along the segment @xmath82 .",
    "we choose the determination of @xmath83 that behaves like @xmath49 ( resp .",
    "@xmath84 ) at infinity when @xmath76 ( resp .",
    "@xmath78 ) and then keep a continuous determination of @xmath85 when @xmath86 moves along the path of integration .    making use of the symmetry principles ( [ recur - eq ] ) and ( [ sym - eq ] ) ,",
    "one deduces easily from theorems [ expl - even ] and [ expl - odd ] similar integral representations for the solutions of ( [ ernst ] ) , that is in the case of a positive integer coefficient @xmath37 .",
    "the second result concerns the correspondance between the dirichlet and neumann data @xmath54 and @xmath55 . having a lax pair is equivalent to the existence of a closed differential form . by poincar lemma",
    ", this leads to the vanishing of an integral on a closed contour , the so - called global relation . in the present case",

    "a similar statement holds when @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "in that case , ( [ rel - glob1 ] ) does not allow the reconstruction of @xmath55 .",
    "a relation that works is obtained by integrating another differential form , see ( [ defw2 ] ) .",
    "making use of the equation conjugate to ( [ gaspt ] ) , that is changing @xmath37 into @xmath93 , we derive the converse reconstruction of the dirichlet data @xmath54 from the neumann data @xmath55 , still when @xmath94 is an even coefficient . in theorem",
    "[ corresp ] , it is actually not necessary to assume smoothness of the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 on the boundary circle @xmath56 .",

    "apparently , the reconstruction of @xmath55 from ( [ rel - glob1 ] ) , or a similar relation , is not completely straightforward .",
    "it may be conjectured that the reconstruction of @xmath55 should be possible by an integral transform , like one of the abel type , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we were not able to find such an integral transform in the present case .",
    "our method uses rather the symmetry involved in the problem and the property of a particular linear differential equation stemming from the computation of a contour integral by cauchy formula . in section [ lax - pair ]",
    "we recall the notion of lax pairs and compute such pairs for the equation ( [ gaspt ] ) .",
    "we also briefly discuss the use of a lax pair , or the related global relation , in deriving an explicit correspondance between dirichlet and neumann data in the simple case of the laplace equation .",
    "the study of two specific riemann - hilbert problems , leading to the proofs of theorems [ expl - even ] and [ expl - odd ] , is performed in sections [ rh ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ corresp ] is displayed in section [ global ] .",

    "indeed , writing ( [ gaspt ] ) with respect to the complex variables @xmath29 and @xmath98 , we get @xmath99 and a possible way to find a lax pair is by rewriting ( [ ccgs ] ) in the form @xmath100 where the functions @xmath21 and @xmath101 have to be determined . expanding ( [ lp1 ] ) and comparing with ( [ ccgs ] ) , we get @xmath102 differentiating the first equation with respect to @xmath103 , the second one with respect to @xmath29 , and adding , we obtain @xmath104 so that @xmath105 satisfies the adjoint equation of ( [ ccgs ] ) ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "we end this section with a brief discussion on the possible use of a lax pair for the derivation of an explicit correspondance between different types of boundary data .",

    "the jumps on the left half of @xmath138 on @xmath191 and on @xmath135 on @xmath192 can be computed in the same way .",
    "the jumps on @xmath226 and @xmath227 can be derived from the symmetry relation satisfied by @xmath48 , @xmath228the result is as follows . for @xmath206 , where the path of integration @xmath229 in each of the above integrals is the subarc of @xmath138 from @xmath230 to @xmath231 , in the positive direction .",
    "for @xmath208 , we have where @xmath229 in each of the integrals denotes the subarc of @xmath135 from @xmath230 to @xmath231 , in the negative direction .",
