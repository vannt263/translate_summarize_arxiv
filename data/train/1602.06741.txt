    "[ coro3 ] we have @xmath255 as @xmath256 .",
    "now we will calculate the value of the constant @xmath6 defined in @xcite for regular @xmath9-gonal norms .",
    "let us recall the definition .",
    "given a pair @xmath34 of mutually birkhoff orthogonal unit vectors ( i.e. , a conjugate pair ) , we define @xmath257 then the constant @xmath258 is defined to be the supremum of @xmath259 taken over all conjugate pairs of @xmath2 .",
    "[ teocepoly ] let @xmath218 be a plane endowed with a norm whose unit circle is an affine regular @xmath9-gon , with @xmath217 .",
    "then @xmath260    let the unit circle @xmath261 be the polygon @xmath262 , and denote by @xmath263 the midpoint of the segment @xmath264 $ ] , identifying @xmath265 with @xmath188 .",
    "then it is clear that any conjugate pair must be @xmath266 or @xmath267 , for some @xmath268 .",
    "assume first that @xmath261 is the regular @xmath9-gon in the standard euclidean plane @xmath269 for which the midpoints @xmath270 and @xmath271 are precisely the vectors @xmath224 and @xmath223 .",
    "hence for any @xmath272 , the value of @xmath273 is precisely the squared euclidean norm of @xmath59 ( see @xcite , section 2 ) .",
    "notice that the unit circle of @xmath238 is the euclidean circle inscribed to the polygon @xmath261 , and therefore it is easy to see that @xmath274 , attained whenever @xmath59 is the midpoint of a side of @xmath261 .",
    "also we have @xmath275 , attained when @xmath59 is a vertex of @xmath261 .",
    "thus , @xmath276 now , let @xmath261 be the regular @xmath9-gon in the standard euclidean plane such that the vertices @xmath188 and @xmath189 are @xmath204 and @xmath203 , respectively . again , the value of @xmath277 is the squared euclidean norm of @xmath59 , but now the unit circle of @xmath238 is the euclidean circle circumscribed about @xmath261 .",
    "hence we have @xmath278 and @xmath279 , both attained for the same cases as before .",
    "it follows that @xmath280 and this concludes the proof , once @xmath281 for every @xmath217 .",
    "we have @xmath282 when @xmath256 .    in some sense , the pairs of conjugate directions for which @xmath259 attains its supremum and its infimum are  natural choices \" of pairs of axes .",
    "namely , they are the bi - orthogonal pairs of directions for which the pythagorean theorem has the largest and the smallest distortion , respectively , when compared with euclidean geometry .",
    "we finish this section by calculating the constant @xmath29 for regular @xmath9-gonal norms , as mentioned before proposition [ cdbounds ] .",
    "[ cd4n ] let @xmath217 and denote by @xmath283 a norm whose unit circle is an affine regular @xmath9-gon . then @xmath284    theorem 5.2 in @xcite states that @xmath285 and in the proof it is clarified that this value is attained for a pair @xmath34 such that @xmath18 .",
    "then the result follows immediately from lemma [ ineqcdcr ] .",
    "we have @xmath286 as @xmath256 .",
    "in @xcite , remark 13 , the authors conjectured the existence of a normed space @xmath2 for which there are no @xmath34 with @xmath287 such that @xmath288 .",
    "we use the sine function approach to prove that such a finite dimensional space does not exist .",
    "[ prop1 ] let @xmath2 be a minkowski space .",
    "then there exist @xmath34 with @xmath206 such that @xmath289 .    the set @xmath290 given by @xmath291 is compact . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that the sine function @xmath292 is continuous in planes , but the proof can obviously be extended to higher dimensional spaces .",
    "it follows that @xmath219 is the infimum of the compact image @xmath293 , and the proof is finished .",
    "we devote this section to the calculation of some trigonometric constants for @xmath8 planes . here , as usual , the @xmath8 plane is the usual @xmath294 endowed with the norm @xmath295 defined as @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the usual coordinate representation in the basis @xmath207 , and @xmath298 $ ] . also , denote the unit circle of @xmath299 by @xmath300 .",
    "we start by calculating the constant @xmath6 for an @xmath8 plane .",
    "assume that @xmath305 , and @xmath306 .",
    "the case @xmath307 is the euclidean plane , and the norms @xmath308 and @xmath309 are the rectilinear norms , for which @xmath6 was already calculated in section [ secdpolygon ] .",
    "we begin with the calculation of @xmath310 . to perform the calculations ,",
    "assume that the symplectic bilinear form @xmath13 $ ] is the usual determinant in @xmath294 .",
    "thus , the associated antinorm is precisely the conjugate norm @xmath311 .",
    "it is easy to see that the only pairs of conjugate directions of @xmath8 and @xmath312 are @xmath207 and @xmath313 .",
    "therefore , @xmath314 where we introduce the notation @xmath315 to avoid confusion when performing the calculations for the @xmath312 norm .",
    "let @xmath316 be given by @xmath317 .",
    "then @xmath318 , and @xmath319 hence , in order to determine @xmath320 , we just have to study the behavior of the function @xmath321 when @xmath232 ranges from @xmath322 to @xmath160 ( the symmetry guarantees that we do not need to consider negative values for @xmath232 ) .",
    "geometrically , this is the squared euclidean norm of the point @xmath323 .",
    "standard calculus gives immediately that the maximum and minimum values attained by this function are @xmath324 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath325 on the other hand , we use the formula @xmath326|}{||x||.||y||_a}$ ] to calculate @xmath327 thus , @xmath328 since @xmath329 , we have that @xmath330 now , we calculate @xmath331 .",
    "the argument is basically the same , but the maximum and minimum values attained by @xmath332 , when @xmath232 ranges from @xmath322 to @xmath160 , are @xmath160 and @xmath333 , respectively .",
    "hence @xmath334 we calculate @xmath335 relative to the other pair of conjugate directions in the same way as before , to obtain @xmath336 and since @xmath337 , we have @xmath338 in particular , @xmath339 .",
    "this means , in some sense , that if @xmath77 and @xmath165 are conjugate , then the spaces @xmath8 and @xmath312 are equally far from being euclidean .",
    "[ calccd ] let @xmath340 be numbers such that @xmath304 , and consider the norms @xmath295 and @xmath311 in @xmath294 defined as usual .",
    "we have @xmath341\\right.}\\left(\\alpha(1-\\alpha)^{q-1 } + ( 1-\\alpha)\\alpha^{q-1}\\right)^{-1/q}\\left(\\alpha(1-\\alpha)^{p-1}+(1-\\alpha)\\alpha^{p-1}\\right)^{-1/p } .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by symmetry it is enough to consider the points of @xmath300 of the form @xmath342 with @xmath343 $ ] . by simple differentiation",
    "we see that the supporting direction to @xmath344 at such a point is @xmath345 .",
