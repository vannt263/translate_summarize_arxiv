    "the quantum walk ( qw ) as a generalization of the random walk ( rw ) is important in quantum algorithm research  @xcite because of the exponentially speed up the hitting time in glued tree graphs  @xcite .",
    "qws have been demonstrated using nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , single photons in bulk  @xcite and fibre optics  @xcite and the scattering of light in waveguide arrays  @xcite .",
    "with decoherence the spreading of the qw is transited from a ballistic to diffusive scaling  @xcite and with quantumness losing the qw is transited to rw  @xcite .",
    "an open quantum system loses its quantumness when information of the quantum state leaks into the environment around it .",
    "the unidirectional flow of information in which the decoherence and noise act consistently characterizes a markovian process  @xcite .",
    "however , there are some systems such as soft- and condensed - matter systems strongly coupling to the environment and the coupling leads to a different regime where information also flows back into the system from the surroundings , which characterizes a non - markovian process  @xcite . during a markovian process , the distinguishability tends to monotonically decrease for pair of states , here in this paper , the quantum walker+coin states  @xcite .",
    "memory effects caused by the information flowing back to the system during a non - markovian process can temporarily increase it for the walker+coin states .",
    "in this paper , we use quantum correlation between quantum walker and his coin as a distinguishability to present the behavior of a qw on a line with a non - markovian dephasing coin .",
    "the quantum correlation between quantum walker and his coin decays quickly but is interrupted by revivals .",
    "correspondingly , in the short time regime , the position variance of a non - markovian decoherent qw deviates from both those of the ideal qw and rw . in the long time",
    "limit , the quantum correlation tends to be zero and the position variance shows a diffusive spread .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we introduce an idea qw on a line . in sec .",
    "iii , the non - markovian dephasing on the coin state  two - level system is shown .",
    "we study the effects from the non - markovian dephasing on coin .",
    "compared to both idea qws and rws , non - markovian decoherent qws show different behavior in the short time regime . in sec .",
    "iv , the quantum correlation between quantum walker and his non - markovian dephasing coin is studied via the quantum discord ( qd ) and measurement - induced disturbance ( mid ) .",
    "it is observed that both of qd and mid show oscillating behavior in the short time regime and tend to zero in the long time limit . in sec .",
    "v , we analyze the behavior of non - markovian decoherent qws in the long time limit and observe that because of disappearance of the quantum correlation between quantum walker and his coin , a non - markovian decoherent qw in the long time regime shows a diffusive behavior .",
    "finally we summarize the paper briefly .",
    "for an ideal qw on a line  @xcite , the hilbert space is @xmath0 with the walker hilbert space  @xmath1 spanned by the position vectors  @xmath2 and @xmath3 the coin space spanned by two orthogonal vectors which we denote  @xmath4 .",
    "each step by the walker is effected by two subsequent unitary operators : the coin - flip operator @xmath5 for  @xmath6 the hadamard matrix and the conditional - translation operator @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the resultant step operator is @xmath10 with  @xmath11 the identity operator on  @xmath1 .",
    "the choice of initial state  @xmath12 is important in studies of qws because the interference features sensitively depend on the choice of state .",
    "this sensitivity is persistent because the dynamics are unitary hence do not die out . on the other hand the general properties of qws do not depend on the choice of initial state so the choice of initial state is not crucial provided that the focus is on such characterization .",
    "as we are interested in general properties , the initial state is not important so we choose the initial state with the walker at the origin of a line and holding a coin in an equal superposition of the  @xmath13 and  @xmath14 states : @xmath15    after  @xmath16 steps , the final state of the walker+coin system is @xmath17 we now follow the evolution by performing a fourier transform of the evolution operator to the `` momentum ''  @xmath18 space .    the eigenvectors @xmath19 of  @xmath20 and @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) have the eigenrelations @xmath22 for  @xmath18 a continuous real quantity .",
    "the inverse transformation is @xmath23 the walker is initialized at the origin of a line so the walker s initial state is @xmath24 in the  @xmath25 basis for the walker , the evolution operator becomes @xmath26 with  @xmath27 the coin state and @xmath28    the general density operator for the initial state of the system in the @xmath18 basis can be expressed as @xmath29 the final state after @xmath16 steps is @xmath30 in terms of the superoperator @xmath31 , @xmath32    the walker s position is on a line labeled  @xmath33 with the initial position localized at  @xmath34 .",
    "measurement of the walker s position corresponds to the projection - valued measure  @xmath35 on the walker reduced state ( after tracing out the coin ) .",
    "the probability @xmath36 that the walker will be found at the position  @xmath33 is @xmath37 which is obtained by tracing over the coin of the walker+coin state and then measuring the walker s position .",
    "we can characterize @xmath36 by the moments of this position distribution  @xmath38 .",
    "the mean  @xmath39 and variance @xmath40 can be used as the measure of qws and show the signature of qws compared to rws . instead of variance",
    "we can also use its square root , namely dispersion @xmath41 for a rw ,  @xmath42 , which is characteristic of diffusive motion , whereas , for a qw , a quadratic enhancement is achieved :  @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "as a function of time @xmath16 with @xmath44 and different @xmath45 : @xmath46 in red , @xmath47 in green , @xmath48 in blue presenting non - markovian dephasing and @xmath49 in black presenting markovian dephasing.,width=340 ]    we now generalize to allow for decoherence .",

    "suppose that before each unitary flip of the coin , a completely positive map is performed on the coin .",
    "we consider a pure dephasing quantum process for which the density matrix @xmath50 of the open system evolves according to the master equation @xmath51 + \\frac{\\gamma(t)}{2}\\left[\\sigma_z\\rho_\\text{c}(t)\\sigma_z,\\rho_\\text{c}(t)\\right ] .",

    "<S> quantum walk acts obviously different from its classical counterpart , but decoherence will lessen and close the gap between them . to understand this process </S>",
    "<S> , it is necessary to investigate the evolution of quantum walk under different situation of decoherence . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we study a non - markovian decoherent quantum walk on a line . in the short time regime , </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the walk deviates from both idea quantum walks and classical random walks . </S>",
    "<S> the position variance as a measure of quantum walk starts oscillating from the first several steps and tends to be linear on time and showing a diffusive spread in the long time limit , which is caused by the non - markovian dephasing affecting on quantum correlations between quantum walker and his coin . </S>",
    "<S> we also study both quantum discord and measurement - induced disturbance as measures of quantum correlations and observe that both of them oscillate in the short time regime and tend to be zero in the long time limit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore quantum walk with non - markovian decoherence tends to diffusive spreading behavior in the long time limit , while in the short time regime it oscillates between a ballistic and diffusive spreading behavior , and the quantum correlation collapses and revivals due to the memory effect . </S>"
