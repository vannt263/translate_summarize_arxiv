    "since bohr formulated his correspondence principle @xcite it is arguably agreed that classical physics can be used to explain quantum phenomena in the classical limit , i.e. , in the case of high quantum numbers .",
    "for example , electron wavefunctions reduce to bohr orbits in the limit of high principal and orbital quantum numbers , and laser amplitudes display vanishing fluctuations in the limit of an infinite mean photon flux . by contrast , it is less anticipated that quantum mechanical predictions , i.e. , implications considered to be purely quantum mechanical , can be fruitfully applied for a better understanding of classical systems . in this context",
    "it was recently proposed that a violation of bell s inequalities , so far considered to be a typical quantum mechanical phenomenon displayed only by quantum systems , may be used to quantify correlations between coupled degrees of freedom of classical systems @xcite .",
    "such strong correlations of classical systems , called _ classical entanglement _ or _ nonquantum entanglement _ in the literature @xcite , have been used to describe the specific coherence properties of classical light beams , either for discrete or continuous variables @xcite . however , classical entanglement has been demonstrated so far only for coupled degrees of freedom of the _ same particle _ , e.g. , amplitude and polarization of a photon in a classical light beam , and was expected to reach its limits if true nonlocal multiparticle entanglement is considered .",
    "it has thus been conjectured that nonlocal _",
    "entanglement is of exclusive quantum nature @xcite . in this letter",
    "we demonstrate that bell s inequalities can be equally violated with spatially separated particles produced by classical systems , i.e. , photons emitted by classical light sources recorded in spatially separated modes .",
    "we thus show that nonlocal multiparticle entanglement is not restricted to the quantum world but may be observed also with classical systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .  2 we present the system under investigation and introduce the normalized first and second order spatial intensity correlation functions employed for bell s inequalities involving spatial degrees of freedom . in sect .",
    "3 we expand the analysis and introduce intensity correlation functions of higher order which we use , with a new interpretation , to violate the bell inequalities . in sect .  4",
    "we present our experimental results and in sect .",
    "5 we finally conclude .",
    "recently , we demonstrated that photons emitted by statistically independent quantum sources , e.g. , single photon emitters ( spe ) , may be path - entangled if the photons are recorded in the far field such that the individual photon source remains unknown @xcite .",
    "the entanglement was proven by a violation of bell s inequalities @xcite formulated for spatial degrees of freedom . the question remains whether such nonlocal correlations among photons recorded in spatially separated modes can be produced with classical light , i.e. , photons emitted by classical sources . to investigate this question we generalize in what follows the system of two spe discussed in @xcite to classical light sources .",
    "we thus consider a system of two statistically independent identical classical light sources , e.g. , thermal light sourcess ( tls ) , located at @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and two detectors placed in the far - field of the sources at @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : detectionscheme ] ) . due to the far field condition and the indistinguishability of the emitted photons",
    "the electric field operator @xmath6 is written in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the amplitude of the total electric field at @xmath4 and @xmath9 describes the relative optical phase accumulated by a photon emitted from the source at @xmath10 with respect to a photon emitted from the source at @xmath11 , both reaching the @xmath12-th detector at @xmath4 ( cf .",

    "( [ eq : ch74 ] ) .",
    "hitherto the spatial intensity correlation functions of first and second order at equal times , defined as @xcite @xmath27 have to be cast into a form as to be interpreted as detection probabilities of single photon detection events @xmath28 and joint two - photon detection events @xmath29 , respectively @xcite .",
    "if both light sources are incoherent and statistically independent the emitted intensity is distributed isotropically in space .",
    "the first order correlation function @xmath30 is thus a constant , independent of @xmath19 .",

    "the detection of the first @xmath0 photons can be interpreted as a projection of the two tls sources onto a state which emits the subsequent photon not uniformly but in a strongly correlated manner , such that the bell inequalities are violated .",
    "this projection of the sources can be seen as similar to einstein podolsky rosen steering by photon subtraction as recently discussed in @xcite . from this point of view",
    "the entanglement and violation of bell s inequalities is a consequence of the nonvanishing cross correlations between noncommuting quadrature phase components of the two spatially separated fields of the type @xmath105 , with @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the density matrix of the field after @xmath0 photons have been recorded .",
    "indeed , for the cross correlation coefficient @xmath108 @xcite we obtain @xmath109 , which approaches unity in the limit @xmath110 .",
    "to measure @xmath103 with two statistically independent tls we used a mask with two identical slits of width @xmath111 m and separation @xmath112 m .",
    "the mask is located a few centimeters behind a rotating ground glass disk which is illuminated by a linearly polarized frequency - doubled nd : yag laser at @xmath113 nm ( see fig .  3 ) . within each slit a large number of time - dependent speckles is produced , generated by the stochastically interfering waves scattered from the granular surface of the ground glass disk , representing many independent point - like sub - sources equivalent to an ordinary spatially incoherent thermal source .",
    "the coherence time of the pseudothermal sources depends on the rotational speed of the disk @xcite and was chosen in the experiment to @xmath114 ms . to ensure that the two tls radiate with equal intensity we enlarged the incident laser beam by a microscope objective to 1  cm providing a homogeneous illumination of the mask . to determine @xmath103 we measured the intensity of the light scattered by the two tls at different positions using a conventional digital camera placed in the focal point ( fourier plane ) of a lens behind the mask ( @xmath115 ) thus fulfilling the far field condition ( see fig .",
    "hereby , each pixel of the camera serves as a detector to register the intensity at position @xmath116 , and we correlated @xmath117 pixels at @xmath118 , each separated by one pixel along the @xmath119-direction to use @xmath117 different pixels with identical @xmath120-values , with another pixel at @xmath121 . with more than a million of pixels",
    "the digital camera has the advantage that the amount of data accumulated in one frame to correlate the intensities at @xmath0 different pixels is exceedingly larger than using @xmath0 single photon detectors @xcite . in order to obtain interference signals of high visibility ,",
    "the integration time of the camera @xmath122 was chosen much shorter than the coherence time of the tls , in our case @xmath123  ms @xmath124 .",
