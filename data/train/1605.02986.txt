    "the dynamical and static structure functions are of paramount importance in describing the dynamics and the structure of many - body systems .",
    "these quantities can be measured in scattering experiments ( involving electrons , neutrons and x - ray radiation ) on substances like liquids @xcite , glasses @xcite and dense plasmas @xcite .",
    "the conventional dynamical structure function @xmath4 , is defined as the fourier transform of the 2-point dynamical density correlation @xmath5 whereas its static ( equal - time ) counterpart is given by @xmath6    it is not difficult to realize , though , that the 2-point structure function is in fact the lowest rank member of a hierarchy of more general @xmath7-point structure functions , the fourier transforms of @xmath7-point density correlations @xcite : @xmath8 note that we use a slightly changed notation here compared to that used in @xcite , to maintain the convention used in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the higher rank structure functions have enjoyed less of a popularity , but it has been recognized that they may provide important additional information beyond @xmath9 , on the dynamics of many body systems @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath4 is linked via the centrally important fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite with the linear response of many - body systems . in a similar fashion",
    ", it is expected that the higher rank structure functions are linked via the higher - order fdt - s with the nonlinear response of these systems @xcite .",
    "the explicit relationships have been recently worked out to the fourth order , where the quartic fdt establishes a , rather complex , connection between quartic response functions and 5-point structure functions @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we are concerned with the static ( equal - time ) limit of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the corresponding static ( zero - frequency ) quadratic response function @xmath12 .",
    "there is also a well known intimate relationship between the 2-point static structure function and the equilibrium 2-particle distribution function @xmath13 with its companion 2-particle correlation function @xmath14 ; similarly linked are the 3-point static structure function and the 3-particle distribution and correlation functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 . to see this , we recall the conventionally defined 2-particle and 3-particle distribution functions , and define the respective pair and triplet correlation functions by @xmath17 and @xmath18 the fourier transforms of the correlation functions are linked to the respective structure functions by the linear @xmath19 and quadratic @xcite @xmath20 + n_{0}^2 h^{(3)}({\\bf k}_1,{\\bf k}_2 ) & \\\\ \\textbf{k}_{0}+\\textbf{k}_{1}+\\textbf{k}_{2}=0 \\nonumber \\label{s2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] relationships , where @xmath21 is the macroscopic density .",
    "the question whether the structure functions of higher ranks can be reduced ( at least approximately ) to appropriately defined clusters of structure functions of lower rank has been attracting considerable attention over the past decades . in particular , the possibility of the `` factorization '' of the 3-point structure function , @xmath22 , in terms of 2-point structure functions , has been studied by several authors @xcite .    the purpose of this work is to investigate the factorization properties of the 3-point structure functions by focusing on a particular system of great current interest , the ( three - dimensional ) yukawa - liquid . in this system the potential between the particles has the form of an exponentially screened coulomb potential , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the charge of the particles and @xmath25 is the screening ( debye ) length .",
    "apart from its applicability to actual physical systems , the yukawa potential as a theoretical model has the convenient feature that by adopting limits of the screening parameter one can investigate both the properties of a system with long range interaction @xmath26 and short range interaction @xmath27 .",
    "the interest in yukawa systems is also motivated by ongoing studies of dusty ( complex ) plasmas @xcite . in the standard model for dusty plasmas",
    "one considers explicitly only one type of charged species ( the dust particles ) , the presence of the additional plasma species and their effects on the main component are accounted for via the screening of the interaction potential between the dust particles .",
    "when all effects that lead to an anisotropy of the interaction ( e.g. streaming ions ) are neglected , the potential between the particles acquires the exponentially screened coulomb form , becoming a debye - hckel , or yukawa potential , where the debye length that expresses the screening property of the plasma medium that embeds the system of dust particles .",
    "( the system so defined is sometimes referred to as the `` yukawa one - component plasma '' , yocp , based on its similarities to the classical coulomb ",
    "one - component plasma , ocp , model ) .",
    "the ratio of the unscreened inter - particle potential energy to the thermal energy is expressed by the nominal coupling parameter @xmath28 where @xmath29 is temperature and @xmath30 is the wigner - seitz radius .",
    "the normalization of the length by @xmath31 leads to the dimensionless screening parameter @xmath32 .",
    "we investigate the system in the strongly coupled liquid phase ( @xmath33 ) , where the interparticle potential energy dominates over the thermal energy and a prominent liquid structure builds up .",
    "it is not the subject of our studies , but we note that the system turns into a crystal when the coupling parameter reaches a certain critical value that depends on the screening parameter @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the quantities of interest and in section 3 we describe our computational approach . section 4 presents the results and a short summary is given in section 5 .",
    "exact relationships between the 2- and 3-point static structure functions ( or equivalently the respective particle correlation functions ) exist .",
    "in particular , the second equation of the bgy hierarchy can be expressed in terms of the 2-point and 3-point static structure functions @xcite .",
    "however , this is not immediately useful , because it merely expresses one unknown function , the 2-point structure function ( or 2-particle correlation function ) , in terms of another , 3-point structure function ( or 3-particle correlation function ) , and it requires an approximate closure relation to become solvable .",
    "a further exact relationship is based on the density functional formalism @xcite , where in addition to the conventional ( binary ) direct correlation function @xmath34 the ternary direct correlation function @xmath35 can be introduced .",
    "then , @xmath36 , \\label{oz}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 can be obtained from the free energy functional @xcite .",
    "this expression , however , does not provide any calculational guidance either without further approximation . provided , however , that if @xmath38 is small , the 3-point static structure function @xmath0 can , at least approximately , be factorized in terms of 2-point static structure functions : @xmath39    we note that the factorization ( [ factorization ] ) leads to an approximate relation between the 2-particle and 3-particle correlation functions . in view of the relations ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) the relationship ( [ factorization ] ) can be expressed as @xmath40 , \\label{hk1k2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or in configuration space as @xmath41 .",
    "\\label{hrr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the approximation ( [ factorization ] ) was originally introduced in @xcite and was called the `` convolution approximation '' . oneil and rostoker @xcite , lie and ichikawa @xcite showed that the expression ( [ hk1k2 ] ) is formally exact to lowest order of the plasma parameter and small @xmath42 values .",
    "ichimaru @xcite used the approximation ( [ hrr ] ) as an ansatz to solve the second equation of the bbgky hierarchy and so to calculate the dielectric response function for a strongly correlated electron liquid .",
    "golden and kalman @xcite pointed out that in the framework of the quadratic fdt ( [ hrr ] ) is a trivial consequence of the application of the rpa and is valid for arbitrary @xmath42-values .",
    "remarkably though , as discussed by iyetomi and ichimaru @xcite , while not exact , ( [ hk1k2 ] ) still represents a reasonably good approximation for the ocp up to a fairly large value of the coupling parameter @xmath43 . in the language of the mayer cluster expansion , the approximation amounts to the neglect of the irreducible bridge - functions , i.e. to invoking the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) approximation .",
    "this latter has been shown to provide a good description of the equilibrium properties of a strongly coupled ocp .",
    "iyetomi and ichimaru @xcite also identified the group of bridge functions that can be generated by a systematic expansion in order to go beyond the hnc and have shown that the first correction to the convolution approximation is : @xmath44 based on this expression , barrat , hansen and pastore @xcite proposed the following factorization approximation for the triplet direct correlation function in dense , classical fluids ( referred to as the `` bhp model '' in the following ) : @xmath45 where the @xmath46 function originates from the solution of the integral equation : @xmath47 the predictions of this theory were tested by computing the 2-point and 3-point structure functions via molecular dynamics simulations for the soft sphere model near freezing and by using these in the relation ( [ oz ] ) .",
    "the bhp model was successfully applied in , e.g. , @xcite for a binary mixture of hard spheres , quantum hard - sphere yukawa fluids , and liquid water .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine in some detail the accuracy of the approximation ( [ factorization ] ) and the performance of the bhp model in yukawa - liquids .",
    "the simplest configuration of the three @xmath42-vectors involved in the approximation is when all of them are collinear : this scenario was studied in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "here we consider some special geometries when the vector - arguments of @xmath48 are not collinear .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have been indispensable in the studies of static properties , transport coefficients , collective excitations , as well as instabilities in strongly coupled yukawa liquids . here we use a standard md method to describe our 3-dimensional yukawa liquid : we simulate the motion of @xmath49=10  000 particles , within a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions , via the integration of their newtonian equations of motion .",
    "the exponential decay of the yukawa potential makes it possible to use a cutoff radius in the calculation of the forces acting on the particles , beyond which the interaction of particle pairs can be neglected .",
    "setting @xmath50 provides good accuracy at the relatively high value of the screening parameter considered in this work , @xmath51 .",
    "time integration is performed via the velocity - verlet scheme . at the initialization of the simulations",
    "the particles are positioned randomly within the simulation box , while their initial velocities are sampled from a maxwellian distribution corresponding to the prescribed system temperature ( defined by @xmath43 ) .",
    "the simulations start with a thermalization phase , during which the particle velocities are rescaled in each time step , in order to reach the desired temperature .",
    "this procedure is stopped before the data collection takes place , where the stability of the simulation is confirmed by monitoring the temperature as a function of time .",
    "the static structure functions @xmath52 and @xmath48 are computed in equilibrium md simulations , via definitions ( [ linsk ] ) and ( [ quadsk ] ) , for a series of wave number values matching the simulation box . the minimum accessible wave number defined by the edge length @xmath53 of the simulation box is @xmath54 .",
    "the computations give direct access to wave number vectors that obey the periodic boundary conditions , i.e. to a `` grid '' of wave numbers with @xmath55 , where @xmath56 are integers ( with the @xmath57 combination being excluded ) . in some of the cases",
    "the structure functions have to be computed for @xmath58 values different from the above , in these circumstances we use an interpolation of the values from the four neighboring points that are on the grid .    to address the question : `` how accurate is the approximate factorization relation for our system ? ''",

    "to describe the accuracy of the factorization approximation we compute the following quantities : @xmath62    both of these give a relation between the `` exact '' characteristics and their approximate values obtained with the assumption that the direct factorization relation ( [ factorization ] ) holds , i.e. @xmath63 ; evidently the @xmath64 indicator is a more sensitive measure than @xmath65 .",
