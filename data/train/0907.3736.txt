    "the magnetocaloric effect , _",
    "i.e. _ , a temperature change induced by an adiabatic change of an external magnetic field was discovered in iron by warburg in 1881 @xcite .",
    "this effect also has a long history in cooling applications .",
    "for example , adiabatic demagnetization of paramagnetic salts was the first method to reach temperatures below 1k @xcite . among the many experimental but also theoretical investigations to follow , we would like to mention in particular the computation of the field variation of the entropy in a quantum spin-1/2 @xmath2 chain @xcite .",
    "this investigation is remarkable in so far as it is one of the very first numerical computations for an interacting quantum many - body system .",
    "the relation of the entropy of quantum spin chains in a magnetic field to magnetic cooling was also noted @xcite and even one exact computation was performed , albeit for a chain with a strong easy - axis anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the magnetocaloric effect in quantum spin systems has recently attracted renewed attention .",
    "the reason for this is two - fold . on the one hand ,",
    "field - induced quantum phase transitions lead to universal responses when the applied field is varied adiabatically @xcite . on the other hand , it was observed that the magnetocaloric effect is enhanced by geometric frustration @xcite , promising improved efficiency in low - temperature cooling applications . in this context , the isotropic spin-1/2 heisenberg chain , the isotropic and anisotropic @xmath3 chain in a transverse field @xcite , and the quantum ising chain in a transverse field @xcite were also revisited .",
    "one further example of a non - frustrated quantum spin chain where the magnetocaloric effect was computed is the ferrimagnetic spin-@xmath4-@xmath5 chain @xcite .",
    "finally , the adiabatic cooling rate has recently been measured on the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain compound [ cu(@xmath6-c@xmath7o@xmath8)(4-aminopyridine)@xmath7(h@xmath7o)]@xmath9 @xcite and relatedly the magnetocaloric effect of the spin-1/2 isotropic heisenberg and @xmath2 chains was computed exactly @xcite .    in this paper we will investigate magnetocaloric properties of quantum spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chains given by the hamiltonians @xmath10 @xmath11 is the antiferromagnetic exchange constant , @xmath12 an external magnetic field , @xmath13 the length of the chain , and @xmath14 are quantum spin-@xmath0 operators at site @xmath15",
    ". we will use periodic boundary conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath16 .    in section  [ sec : methods ] we will first summarize the methods which we are going to use , namely exact diagonalization ( ed ) and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations using the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) framework .",
    "then we will apply these methods to the @xmath1 chain in section  [ sec : s1chain ] .",
    "the spin @xmath1 heisenberg chain is famous for the presence of the so - called ` haldane ' gap at @xmath17 @xcite . in particular",
    ", we will illustrate with the @xmath1 chain that one can exploit the presence of a spin gap for cooling by adiabatic magnetization at low magnetic fields .",
    "next , we discuss the scaling with spin quantum number @xmath0 in section [ sec : sscal ] .",
    "in particular , we will show that there is a quantum scaling regime at low temperatures close to the saturation field where one has _ linear _ scaling with @xmath0 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : summary ] we will conclude with a summary .",
    "thermodynamic quantities can be computed using spectral representations . for example , the entropy can be written as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the partition function and @xmath20 are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian .    in order to evaluate spectral representations like ( [ eq : specs ] ) , one needs to diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "if this is done numerically exactly , this is called exact diagonalization ( ed ) .",
    "first , one should perform a symmetry reduction .",
    "we have used translations and @xmath21-conservation as well as reflections and spin inversion where appropriate .",
    "one can then use a library routine to perform a full diagonalization .",
    "such an approach is very much in the spirit of classic work @xcite .",
    "the main technical differences of our computations and @xcite are : ( i ) we have exploited @xmath22-symmetry to reconstruct the @xmath23 sector from the @xmath24 sectors and the spin - inversion resolved @xmath25 sector , ( ii ) we have used improved implementations of the diagonalization routines @xcite , ( iii ) and we have substantially more powerful computers at our disposal . the combination of these factors enables us to compute full spectra for bigger systems than in the 1960s .",
    "if we are interested only in low - energy properties , we can use iterative diagonalization algorithms like the lanczos method @xcite .",
    "the basic lanczos algorithm @xcite for a hermitian matrix @xmath26 proceeds as follows . for a given normalized start vector @xmath27",
    ", one defines a sequence of normalized lanczos vectors @xmath28 via the recurrence relations @xmath29 with the initial conditions @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the real coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 define the so - called lanczos matrices @xmath34 the crucial point of the lanczos algorithm is that the eigenvalues of @xmath35 yield a good approximation of the extremal eigenvalues of @xmath26 already for @xmath36 much smaller than the total hilbert space dimension .",
    "the lanczos algorithm suffers from one practical problem : the recursion relations ( [ eq : lancrec ] ) are supposed to guarantee mutual orthogonality of the vectors @xmath37 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath38 for @xmath39 . however , this fails to be correct when the computations are carried out numerically , leading to undesired spurious states , called ghost states @xcite .",
    "several strategies have been proposed @xcite in order to deal with the ghost problem during the computation of excited eigenvalues .    here",
    "we suggest another method to compute excited states with controlled accuracy and correct multiplicity .",
    "we start by performing a fixed number @xmath36 of lanczos iterations with a given start vector @xmath27 .",
    "next we compute the orthogonal transformation @xmath40 , @xmath41 diagonalizing the lanczos matrix ( [ eq : lancmat ] ) .",
    "then we fix a number @xmath42 and repeat the lanczos procedure with the same start vector @xmath27 . during this second lanczos",
    "pass we construct @xmath43 vectors @xmath44 the second lanczos pass is needed in order to avoid storing the @xmath45 lanczos vectors @xmath28 .",
    "the vectors @xmath46 given by ( [ eq : lancapproxev ] ) yield approximations to the eigenvectors of @xmath26 .",
    "however , due to the ghost problem , there are spurious vectors which need to be eliminated .",
    "we perform this in two steps . first",
    ", using the observation that the vectors @xmath46 are supposed to be mutually orthogonal , we can eliminate those @xmath46 which have big projections on the @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "second , we reorthogonalize the remaining vectors yielding @xmath49 orthonormal vectors @xmath50 . finally , we project the matrix @xmath26 onto this subspace via @xmath51 a full diagonalization of the @xmath52 matrix @xmath53 and application of the resulting basis transformation to the vectors @xmath50 yields @xmath54 _ orthogonal _ vectors @xmath55 which approximate the eigenvectors of @xmath26 . the eigenvalues @xmath56 associated to the vectors @xmath55 and",
    "their accuracy can be estimated according to @xmath57    according to our experience , there are neither any missing nor any spurious eigenvalues among the converged ones .",
    "it should be mentioned that there is no guarantee that the lanczos procedure yields the complete spectrum for a given start vector @xmath27 , in particular if one has not performed a complete symmetry decomposition .",
    "nevertheless , numerical noise seems to prevent this from happening , at least for sufficiently generic start vectors @xmath27 .",
    "for our procedure one needs to choose the number of lanczos iterations @xmath36 and the dimension of the subspace @xmath58 in advance and the whole procedure needs to be repeated if it turns out that less than the desired number of converged eigenvalues have been obtained . in practice , however , one obtains results of a comparable quality for a class of problems where the choice of @xmath36 and @xmath43 has been adjusted for one representative case . in the examples to be reported below ,",
    "we have been able to obtain about 100 eigenvalues in a given symmetry sector with a relative accuracy of @xmath59 or better using @xmath60 lanczos iterations and @xmath61 vectors @xmath46 .      since the system sizes accessible by either full diagonalization or lanczos diagonalization",
    "are limited , it is desirable to have other methods at our disposal .",
    "for non - frustrated spin models like the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chain ( [ eq : ham ] ) , one can in principle use quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations",
    ". there is , however , one problem : we are particularly interested in the entropy which is usually obtained with large statistical errors from integrating a monte - carlo result for the specific heat . in this subsection",
    "we will summarize how one can circumvent this problem .    in order to obtain a qmc estimate of the temperature dependence of the entropy , we employed an extended ensemble , broad - histogram method  @xcite within the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) framework  @xcite .",
    "based on this approach , thermodynamic quantities can be obtained over a broad range of temperatures from a single qmc simulation that provides estimates of the expansion coefficients @xmath62 of the system s partition function @xmath63 in a high - temperature series expansion : @xmath64 here , @xmath65 is the inverse temperature . in terms of the expansion coefficients @xmath62 ,",
    "the internal energy is obtained using @xmath66 and the free energy from @xmath67 finally , the entropy can be calculated using @xmath68 .    in the qmc simulation , estimates of the first @xmath69 coefficients",
    "@xmath70 are obtained by performing a random walk in the expansion order @xmath36 , such as to sample efficiently all expansion orders from @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 for a spin-@xmath0 chain of @xmath13 sites is known exactly ) to @xmath73 .",
    "this is accomplished using an extension of the wang - landau flat - histogram sampling algorithm  @xcite to the quantum case , as detailed previously in refs .",
    "knowledge of the first @xmath69 coefficients @xmath62 allows for the calculation of thermodynamic quantities from @xmath74 down to a temperature @xmath75 for a system of @xmath13 sites , where @xmath69 scales proportional to @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the spin @xmath1 heisenberg chain , we were able to treat systems with up to @xmath77 sites , accessing temperatures down to @xmath78 , which required an already large value of @xmath79 .",
    "the data shown in this contribution ( and also those in @xcite ) were obtained based on the original version of the algorithm  @xcite , while recently an improved sampling strategy was proposed , based on optimizing the broad histogram quantum monte carlo ensemble  @xcite .       of the @xmath1 heisenberg chain as a function of temperature @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "lines are obtained by ed for @xmath82 and @xmath83 sites , symbols show qmc results for @xmath77 sites . ]",
    "we test and compare the aforementioned numerical methods using the example of the @xmath1 heisenberg chain ( [ eq : ham ] ) with a finite magnetization .",

    "we have performed a full diagonalization .",
    "the corresponding ed curve can therefore be considered as the exact result for @xmath82 .",
    "a full determination of the spectrum is clearly out of reach already for @xmath85 . in this case",
    ", we therefore had to perform a severe truncation to low energies .",
    "thus , the @xmath85 ed curve is only a low - temperature approximation . in this paper ,",
    "the precise temperature range is fixed as follows : let @xmath86 be the highest energy until which the spectrum is definitely complete",
    ". then we restrict to temperatures @xmath87 .",
    "this choice ensures that missing states are suppressed by a boltzmann factor @xmath88 .",
    "this may seem a small number , but since we are discarding many states , extending truncated data to higher temperatures would yield artifacts which are clearly visible on the figure(s ) .",
    "qmc ( denoted by sse in fig .  [ figs1enth3 ] ) is able to treat the larger system size @xmath77 .",
    "this method , however , is best suited for high temperatures .",

    "many previous investigations ( e.g. , @xcite ) have focused on the saturation field .",
