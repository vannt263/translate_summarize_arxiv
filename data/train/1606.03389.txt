    "weyl fermions are chiral massless fermions @xcite . they can appear as quasiparticles in condensed - matter systems with strong spin - orbit coupling , where accidental band crossings cause a dirac - like dispersion around discrete points in the brillouin zone @xcite . in combination with a broken inversion or time - reversal symmetry , dirac points split into pairs of weyl points with opposite chirality .",

[ longitudinal_mr ] ) .",
    "this observation is a direct hint at an inhomogeneous current distribution inside the sample induced by the magnetic field . upon increasing the field @xmath40 corresponding to the contact pair far away from the current electrodes first increases slightly , before the voltage drops to a very small value above 1 t . on the other hand , for the voltage pair @xmath32 , which is almost in line with the current contacts , the voltage initially increases much stronger than @xmath40 until it reaches a maximum at around 0.5  t , indicating a high current flow in this region of the sample at small fields . upon further increasing @xmath10",

    "the sample has the same dimensions as the one studied experimentally , but the point - like current contacts have been attached in the middle of the front and end surfaces , close to the top of the sample for a better illustration .",
    "the magnetic field producing the resistance anisotropy is assumed to be parallel to the line connecting the current electrodes .",
    "@xmath42 corresponds to the initial potential distribution for @xmath43 in zero magnetic field .",
    "the equipotential planes , except for a region close to the current contacts , are parallel indicating a homogeneous current distribution in most parts of the sample .",
    "upon increasing the resistance anisotropy @xmath9 by increasing @xmath7 and keeping @xmath8 constant , we observe a dramatic effect on the potential distribution .",
    "even for a small anisotropy of @xmath44 , we find a pronounced distortion of the equipotential planes inside the sample leading to a strongly reduced region of a quasi - homogeneous potential distribution . for higher anisotropies , e.g.  @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the equipotential planes are highly distorted as predicted for the current jetting effect @xcite .",
    "in order to extract the magnetic field dependence of the voltage from the simulations , we assume a field independent longitudinal resistance @xmath47 . in that case the anisotropy is defined as @xmath48 as given in fig .",
    "[ mr ] . note that for a magnetic field along the crystallographic @xmath34 axis , the transverse components of the resistance are generally not the same due to an anisotropy in the transverse mr in the crystallographic @xmath49 plane . for our simulations",

    "[ longitudinal_mr ] .",
    "it reflects purely the effect of a field induced transverse resistance on the longitudinal measurements .",
    "the agreement between the simulations and the experiment is astonishing .",
    "based on the results of our simulations , we argue that the pronounced voltage drop taking place upon increasing the magnetic field is caused by the intense increase of the transverse @xmath1 ( and correspondingly of the anisotropy @xmath9 ) , which forces the current to concentrate along a straight line connecting the current electrodes .",
    "voltage electrodes on the edge of the sample far away from this line , such as @xmath30 , detect a reduced voltage already for very small magnetic fields ( small anisotropies ) . in our geometry",
    "even an anisotropy of only @xmath54 ( @xmath57  t ) is enough to reduce the voltage to 65  % of the zero - field value . at the same time , the effective cross section of the sample is reduced , leading to higher currents and voltages close to the current jet .",
    "this is reflected in the pronounced increase of @xmath32 below 1  t. for higher fields ( higher anisotropy @xmath9 ) , the dilution even reaches the position of @xmath32 .",
    "we point out that our simulations , based on a simple current conservation model , reproduce quantitatively all the main experimental features , namely the hump at low magnetic fields and the apparent negative longitudinal @xmath26 .",
    "this suggests that the current jetting effect is the dominant cause of the experimentally observed _ negative _ longitudinal @xmath26 .       between the magnetic field and the electrical current for the two contact pairs @xmath30 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the inset in ( b ) displays the region where a negative voltage is observed for the contact pair @xmath32 . ]    in the following , we will focus on the effect of a misalignment between the magnetic field and the current directions . in our experimental setup ,",

    "figure  [ neg_volt ] illustrates the effect of a small misalignment on @xmath38 and @xmath39 for angles up to @xmath63 .",
    "we point out the existence of strong characteristic differences in the field dependence of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the small angle region . for @xmath38",
    "a very small angular misalignment of @xmath64 is enough to obtain an increase in the voltage upon increasing the magnetic field ( see fig .  [",
    "neg_volt]a ) .",
    "this is due to the projection of the transverse mr to the current direction .",
    "moreover , for angles above @xmath65 the initial voltage drop present in the longitudinal configuration ( @xmath66 ) starts to disappear . in the case of @xmath32",
    "a misalignment leads to a characteristically different field dependence .",
    "most strikingly , negative voltages are probed for misalignments between 0.5@xmath67 and 3@xmath67 in magnetic fields above 1 t .",

    "the dip and hump are most pronounced for voltage contacts lying in that plane ( such as @xmath32 ) and disappear for voltage contacts far away ( such as @xmath30 , not shown here ) @xcite .",

    "for large resistance anisotropies , their position is only determined by the geometry of the sample and the position of the electrodes .",
    "this is a further evidence that the increase of the transverse resistance upon increasing field strongly influences any @xmath26 measurements in nbp and in similar materials . in general , for the longitudinal mr , the requirements on the alignment between the magnetic field and the current directions are extremely stringent ( misalignment < 0.25 @xmath67 in our setup ) .",

    "two voltage contact pairs @xmath30 ( red lines ) and @xmath32 ( blue lines ) at different positions on the sample show a different field dependence due to an inhomogeneous current distribution . in the first case ( solid lines )",
    "point - like current electrodes were spot - welded to the samples and in the second case ( dashed lines ) the current electrodes were attached with silver paste covering the whole front and end surfaces of the samples . ]",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] displays the `` longitudinal @xmath87 '' for the four members of the taas family measured with two different voltage contact pairs and two differently prepared pairs of current electrodes .",
    "signatures of an inhomogeneous current distribution are present in all samples .",
    "the experimental setups with the spot - welded current contacts ( solid lines ) follow the schematic configuration illustrated in fig .",
    "the corresponding @xmath88 curves for the different voltage contact configurations @xmath30 and @xmath32 show a qualitative different field dependence .",
    "here , @xmath30 is situated far from the line connecting the current electrodes and @xmath32 close to it .",
    "none of these curves reflects the intrinsic longitudinal @xmath26 .",
    "note that , in the case of taas , the increase of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in high fields points at a small misalignment between the current and the magnetic field directions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig6]c ) .",
    "however , the question remains , how the intrinsic longitudinal @xmath26 can be probed in order to extract the information if the chiral magnetic effect is present in these materials .",
    "there are two obvious experimental approaches improving the homogeneity of the current distribution , and a combination of both might give the best results .",
    "the first is to inject the current homogeneously over the whole cross section of the sample .",
    "it turnes out that this is non - trivial .",
    "soldering contacts is not possible in these materials and neither silver paste nor silver epoxy resulted in a satisfying outcome . the dashed lines in fig .  [ fig6 ]",
    "mark the longitudinal voltages obtained with same voltage pairs as before , but using current electrodes made by silver paste applied over the whole front and end surfaces of the samples .",
    "there is still a significant difference between @xmath38 and @xmath39 for all materials .",
    "this is caused by a local variation of the contact resistance of the silver paint contacts leading to an injection of the current into the sample where the contact resistance is smallest .",
    "since these positions are not necessarily the same on the front and end of the sample , the current direction is likely to be misaligned with respect to the direction of the magnetic field applied parallel to the sample .",
    "this might have been the case for experiments on nbp and taas ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]a and c ) where a negative voltage was detected ( see also sec .",
    "[ angdep ] ) .",
    "the second approach is to make the sample longer and/or thinner , so that the current has enough length to spread homogenously into the whole cross section of the sample .",
    "the critical parameter here is the aspect ratio @xmath89 of the sample length @xmath90 and width @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "it is well known that the resistance anisotropy can be viewed as an effective shortening of the sample in the direction of the magnetic field by a factor of @xmath93 ( or an increase of @xmath91 by a factor of @xmath94 ) @xcite .",
    "given a certain anisotropy of the resistivity @xmath9 , a suitable ratio of @xmath89 for a homogeneous current distribution without resistance anisotropy ( @xmath42 ) has to be be multiplied by a factor of @xmath94 in order to still ensure a homogeneous current distribution .",
    "this is difficult to achieve for high @xmath9 , which is determined in first approximation by the transverse mr .",
    "for example , in the investigated nbp sample with @xmath68 , the required @xmath89 ratio would be higher than 50 .",
    "additionally , our simulations show that these long thin samples are much more sensitive to a misalignment of the magnetic field and electrical current directions . on the other hand ,",
    "our experimental data and simulations show that an inhomogeneous current distribution appears already at very low fields ( very small anisotropy @xmath9 ) .",
    "hence , for small ratios of @xmath89 ( @xmath95 for our sample of nbp ) even a resistance anisotropy below 10 can be large enough to reduce significantly the region in the sample where the current is evenly distributed . as a result",
    ", an inhomogeneous current distribution can appear already at high temperatures , very low magnetic fields , and also in materials with low mobilities .",
    "we have studied the magnetoresistance of the putative weyl semimetals of the taas family , where the chiral anomaly is expected to induce a negative longitudinal @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , an apparent negative @xmath26 is present in all investigated samples , nbp , nbas , tap , and taas .",
    "however , the field dependence of the _ measured _ longitudinal @xmath26 is highly sensitive to the sample geometry and the position of the electrical contacts , in particular of the voltage contacts .",
    "furthermore , it is extremely susceptible to the alignment between magnetic field and current directions .",
    "small deviations from a parallel alignment even lead to an apparent _ negative _ resistance .",
    "our experimental findings provide strong evidence for an inhomogeneous current distribution as the origin of the observed phenomena and seem to exclude the chiral magnetic effect as predominant cause .",
    "this inhomogeneous current distribution emanates from the field - induced resistance anisotropy in these high mobility materials and is known as current - jetting effect .",
    "our conclusion is further supported by finite - element simulations based on a simple current - conservation model with the resistance anisotropy as only free parameter , which agree exceptionally well with the experimental results .",
    "an important implication of the simulations is that the intrinsic longitudinal magnetoresistance is almost constant in changing magnetic fields .",
    "we point out that the inhomogeneous current distribution already appears for very small resistance anisotropies below 10 , which corresponds to small applied magnetic fields in our experiments .",
    "moreover , our simulations expose that for high anisotropies it is very difficult to avoid signatures of the current - jetting effect even in samples with optimized geometry and ideal electrical contacts .",
    "to conclude , our study demonstrates that measurement of the longitudinal @xmath26 in materials with field - induced resistance anisotropy is not straightforward and careful checking is required before intrinsic physical properties of the material , such as the chiral anomaly in weyl semimetals , are extracted .",

    "<S> recently , the existence of massless chiral ( weyl ) fermions has been postulated in a class of semi - metals with a non - trivial energy dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> these materials are now commonly dubbed weyl semi - metals . </S>",
    "<S> one predicted property of weyl fermions is the chiral or adler - bell - jackiw anomaly , a chirality imbalance in the presence of parallel magnetic and electric fields . in weyl semimetals , it is expected to induce a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance , the chiral magnetic effect . here , we present experimental evidence that the observation of the chiral magnetic effect can be hindered by an effect called `` current jetting '' . </S>",
    "<S> this effect also leads to a strong apparent negative longitudinal magnetoresistance , but it is characterized by a highly non - uniform current distribution inside the sample . </S>",
    "<S> it appears in materials possessing a large field - induced anisotropy of the resistivity tensor , such as almost compensated high - mobility semimetals due to the orbital effect . in case of a non - homogeneous current injection , </S>",
    "<S> the potential distribution is strongly distorted in the sample . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> an experimentally measured potential difference is not proportional to the intrinsic resistance . </S>",
    "<S> our results on the magnetoresistance of the weyl semimetal candidate materials nbp , nbas , taas , and tap exhibit distinct signatures of an inhomogeneous current distribution , such as a field - induced `` zero resistance '' and a strong dependence of the `` measured resistance '' on the position , shape , and type of the voltage and current contacts on the sample . </S>",
    "<S> a misalignment between the current and the magnetic - field directions can even induce a `` negative resistance '' . </S>",
    "<S> finite - element simulations of the potential distribution inside the sample , using typical resistance anisotropies , are in good agreement with the experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> our study demonstrates that great care must be taken before interpreting measurements of a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance as evidence for the chiral anomaly in putative weyl semimetals . </S>"
