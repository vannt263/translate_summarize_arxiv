    "mostly , reasons for the undetected progression may be the lack of early symptoms . other reasons are missing awareness of patients and physicians , lack of practical diagnostic tests or incoherent definitions for a diagnosis of the disease . in some cases , the progressing condition may be completely unknown .",

    "we describe the disease dynamics of a population by differential equations involving the transition rates between the compartments @xcite .",
    "the model described here is able to cope with secular trends , i.e. involves calendar time @xmath0 , and the different ages @xmath1 of the subjects in the population .",
    "sometimes these models are called _ age - structured_.    although considering a pre - clinical state preceding a diagnosis is at least going back to 1969 @xcite and a considerable amount of work has been devoted to compartment models since then , to our knowledge a description using differential equations in calendar time @xmath0 and age @xmath1 is new .",
    "furthermore , other models distinguish between disease - specific mortalities and other causes of death ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , we consider this approach critical , because there might be cases where the cause of death is not clearly attributable",
    ". is a death by an infection ( say pneumonia ) due to the disease ( e.g. the immunosuppressive treatment in cancer ) or is it independent from the disease ?",
    "in practical cases this is difficult to judge .    in the third section the compartment model",
    "is used in an example of an partly unobserved disease .",
    "we mimic the situation that a hypothetical population suffers from a fictional ncd that is detected at a certain point in time . from that time on , the medical community is aware , starts to diagnose and treat the newly discovered condition .",
    "in modelling chronic ( irreversible ) diseases , often the three - state model ( compartment model ) in figure [ fig : compmodel ] is used .",
    "the numbers of persons in the states _ normal , undiagnosed _ and _ diagnosed _ are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "although the inclusion of the disease duration @xmath8 is also possible @xcite , hereinafter it is assumed that @xmath9 does not depend on @xmath10 analogously to @xcite , we look for the numbers @xmath11 and @xmath12 of healthy , undiagnosed and diagnosed persons in terms of differential equations , which can be derived from the disease model in figure [ fig : compmodel ] . for the healthy persons we get the following initial value problem of cauchy type : @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the number of ( healthy ) newborns at calendar time @xmath15 the notation @xmath16 denotes the partial derivative with respect to @xmath17 .    the numbers @xmath18 and @xmath3 of diseased persons without and with diagnosis are described similarly : @xmath19    after defining @xmath20 and @xmath21 the overall mortality ( general mortality ) @xmath22 in the population may be written as @xmath23    by using @xmath24 the partial differential equations and read as    @xmath25    together with the initial conditions @xmath26 for all @xmath27 the system - completely describes the dynamics of the disease in the considered population .",

    "the remaining rates ( @xmath31 ) are either accessible by ( specially designed ) epidemiological studies or by official vital statistics ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we use system - to describe a hypothetical irreversible disease , which is undiagnosed until a specific point in time @xmath32 at @xmath33 the disease is detected and diagnosed henceforth . as a consequence , after @xmath33 the prevalence @xmath34 of undetected cases decreases whereas the prevalence @xmath35 of detected cases increases .",
