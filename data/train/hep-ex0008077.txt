    "the unprecedented sensitivities of rare kaon decay experiments and the recent observation of have opened doors to the measurement of the unitarity triangle completely within the kaon system .",
    "the decay is one of the ` golden modes ' for measuring ckm parameters .",
    "measurement of the branching ratio b ( ) provides a clean and unambiguous determination of the ckm matrix element , in particular of the quantity @xmath1    the theoretical uncertainty in is quite small ( @xmath27% ) as the hadronic matrix element is extracted from the branching ratio b(@xmath3 ) .",
    "the branching ratio has been calculated to next - to - leading - log approximation  @xcite , with isospin violation corrections  @xcite and two - loop - electroweak effects  @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath4 \\\\ \\nonumber & = & 3.6\\times10^{-4}([re(\\lambda_t)-1.4\\times10^{-4}]^2 + [ im(\\lambda_t)]^2 ) \\\\ \\nonumber           & = & ( 8.2\\pm3.2)\\times10^{-11},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the error determined by the present uncertainty of @xmath5 .",
    "the current limit on @xmath6@xmath7 mixing , combined with the measured frequency of @xmath8@xmath9 mixing , implies a limit on that has very small theoretical uncertainty  @xcite : b ( ) @xmath10 .",
    "the e787 experiment at bnl  @xcite was designed to search for and collected data in 198991@xcite and then again in 199598 after an upgrade to the detector and beamline  @xcite .",
    "the first observation of was reported in the analysis of the 1995 data set  @xcite .",
    "a new and improved analysis of the 199597 data set has reduced the background levels by almost a factor of three .",
    "a plot of range vs. energy for events passing all other criteria is shown in figure  [ fig : r_e](a ) .",
    "a )    b )    one event is observed in the signal region ( the same one as observed in the 1995 data : see ref .",
    "[ ref : pnn95 ] ) .",
    "a reconstruction of the event is shown in figure  [ fig : r_e](b ) .",
    "the background is measured to be @xmath11 events .",
    "based on this one event , the branching ratio is b ( ) = @xmath12  @xcite . from this measurement , a limit of @xmath13",
    "is determined ; in addition , the following limits on @xmath14 can be set : @xmath15 the final sensitivity of the e787 experiment , based on data from 199598 , should reach a factor of two further to the standard - model ( sm ) expectation for .",
    "the 90% cl upper limit on is b ( ) @xmath16 and a model - independent limit  @xcite on the neutral mode , , can be derived from this result : @xmath17    the decays , such as , can also , in principle , provide a clean determination of ckm matrix parameters ; however , due to the small sm branching ratios , e.g. b ( ) = ( 12)@xmath18 , their usefulness is limited .",
    "e787 has recently set the first limit on any of these modes  @xcite , with b ( ) @xmath19 .",
    "additional new results from e787 include a measurement of the direct emission ( de ) radiation in decay ( k@xmath20 ) and the first observation of structure - dependent radiation ( sd ) in decays ( k@xmath21 ) . with eight times higher statistical sensitivity than previous experiments and better kinematic constraints",
    "e787 has measured a branching ratio for direct emission b(k@xmath20:de ) that is four times smaller than previous results  @xcite , b(k@xmath20:de , 55 mev @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath22 90 mev ) = @xmath24 ( @xmath23 is the kinetic energy of the @xmath25 ) .",
    "e787 has also measured the branching ratio for structure - dependent k@xmath21  @xcite to be b(k@xmath26 ) = @xmath27 .",
    "the vector and axial - vector form factors are @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath30 cl .",
    "significant progress in the determination of the fundamental ckm parameters from the system will be made in the generation of experiments that is now starting : e949 and kopio at bnl , ckm and kami at fnal and e391 at kek .",
    "these measurements can unambiguously determine sm _ cp _ violation parameters .",
    "comparison with the b - system will then over - constrain the triangle and test the sm explanation of _ cp _ violation .",
    "the two most important tests are expected to be :    * comparison of the angle @xmath31 from the ratio b()/b ( ) and the _ cp _ asymmetry in the decay  @xcite .",
    "* comparison of the magnitude @xmath32 from and the ratio of the mixing frequencies of @xmath6 and @xmath8 mesons  @xcite .",
    "improvement in the charged mode will come in two steps : e949 and ckm .",
    "the e787 experiment has already demonstrated sufficient background rejection for a very precise measurement of b ( ) . a new experiment under construction , e949 ,",
    "is expected to run in 200103 .",
    "taking advantage of the very large ags proton flux and the experience gained with the e787 detector , e949 with modest upgrades should observe @xmath33(10 ) sm events in a two year run .",
    "the background is well - understood and is @xmath210% of the sm signal .",
    "a proposal for a further factor of 10 improvement has been initiated at fnal .",
    "the ckm experiment ( e905 ) plans to collect @xmath34(100 ) sm events , with @xmath34(10 ) background events , in a two year run starting after 2005 .",
    "this experiment will use a new technique , with k@xmath35 decay - in - flight and independent momentum ( si and straw - tube trackers ) and velocity ( kaon and pion rich ) spectrometers .",
