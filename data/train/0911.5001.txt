    "in recent years , the two - photon exchange ( tpe ) effect on the electron - nucleon scattering process attracts many interests again after its success in recoiling the discrepancy of the form factor ratio caused by different experimental extraction techniques @xcite .",
    "the newly estimate results showed that the tpe correction is rather important in extracting the proton s form factors from rosenbluth separation because of its explicit angle dependence .",
    "in addition to explaining the form factor ratio discrepancy , further calculations have emphasized the direct connection between the tpe process and the single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) , @xmath7 . for the elastic scattering process",
    ", this asymmetry is expected to be vanishing in the one photon exchange approximation due to time - reversal invariance .",
    "however , it can receive non - zero contributions from the interference between the one - photon exchange amplitude and the imaginary part of the tpe amplitude .",
    "that means a nonzero @xmath8 should be a strong evidence for the exist of the tpe contributions . since the born contribution is not present , the measurements of @xmath8 would provide a unique opportunity to access the information on nucleon structure through the dynamics of the tpe . recently , in the jefferson lab , an experiment was designed to measure the single spin asymmetry of neutron using a vertically polarized @xmath0he target@xcite . since free neutron targets do not exist in nature , one has to consider nucleon bound systems , such as deuteron @xcite or @xmath0he@xcite . for the latter case , within a naive model and with only a symmetric s - wave component in the bound state , the two protons",
    "have opposite spins and therefore one should expect that the electromagnetic polarized response of the @xmath0he essentially is the neutron one .",
    "theoretically , some calculations about the tpe corrections to the ssas for nucleon target have been performed in both the simple hadronic model @xcite and the parton model @xcite . in the latter approach",
    ", the results showed that at @xmath9 the tpe contributions to the ssa for the proton is of order @xmath10 , and for the neutron , at @xmath11 , the ssa is somewhat larger than those for the proton @xcite .",
    "in large momentum transfer region , the electron - nucleon scattering can be considered through the scattering off partons in the nucleon , and well described by the generalized parton distribution functions .",
    "however , the experiment designed in the jefferson lab was concerned to the single spin asymmetry for the neutron under @xmath12 .",
    "in such low @xmath13 range , we believe the simple hadronic model should be more efficient to consider the tpe contributions . in this model ,",
    "the ssa for the proton target has been evaluated @xcite and in present work we further estimate the tpe corrections to the ssas for the neutron and the @xmath0he targets .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present some analytical representations of the tpe contributions to the ssas for the nucleon and the @xmath0he within the simple hadronic model in the following section . in section [ chap - num ] , some numerical results and discussions about the tpe contributions to the ssas for the nucleon and",
    "the @xmath0he targets are presented .",
    "the @xmath0he is also spin@xmath14 particle , thus one can discuss the tpe contributions to the @xmath0he in the same way as the one has been done for the nucleon . here",
    "taking electron - nucleon scattering process @xmath15 for example , as one knows , after considering the tpe contributions , an extra term is introduced in the effective electromagnetic vertex of the nucleon and the vertex becomes : @xmath16 with @xmath17 is the nucleon mass and the three independent momenta are @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "the form factors @xmath24 are usually recombined as @xmath25 and @xmath26 is expressed by @xmath27 . moreover ,",
    "the tpe contributions are separated from those based on one photon approximation , and one have , @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the electromagnetic form factors under one - photon approximation . with the contributions of the tpe process , the reduced differential cross section and the ssa can be expressed as : @xmath31 a_{y } & = & \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon(1+\\epsilon)}{\\tau } } \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{r } } \\big\\ { -g_{m } \\mathcal{i } \\big ( \\delta g_{e } + g_{m } y_{2 \\gamma}\\big ) + g_{e } \\mathcal{i } \\big ( \\delta g_{m } + \\big ( \\frac{2\\epsilon}{1+\\epsilon}\\big ) g_{m } y_{2 \\gamma } \\big ) \\big\\}. \\label{eq - dcs - ay}\\ ] ]    in this work , we restrict ourself to low energy transfer region with @xmath32 .",
    "then in the calculations of the tpe corrections we only include the nucleon as the intermediate state .",

    "the numerical results about tpe corrections to the ssas are displayed in the following sections .",

    "the ir divergences in the tpe loop integral are canceled out by the standard mt corrections , which were introduced by l. m. mo and y. s. tsai @xcite and had been included in the experiment .",
