    "as @xmath25 is polyhedral , each face lies in the relative boundary of a facet of @xmath25 . by condition @xmath275",

    "the above mentioned condition can always be satisfied for @xmath95 large enough .",
    "if @xmath275 was not satisfied , we could land in facets that do not have @xmath29 in their relative boundary .",

    "+ similarly we get @xmath279    so we have shown that @xmath280 for all @xmath163 pointwise . as we assume @xmath199 to be proper and because all elements of @xmath281 are 1-lipschitz with respect to @xmath199 , pointwise convergence of @xmath268 is equivalent to uniform convergence on bounded sets , which again is equivalent to uniform convergence on compact sets in @xmath196 .",
    "see for example @xcite for a reference .",
    "therefore @xmath282 .    for the other direction we have to show that every converging sequence @xmath261 with @xmath282 for some proper face @xmath22 and @xmath150 satisfies the conditions of the theorem .",
    "the proof is based on lemma [ lem : subsequence ] , where we have shown that every sequence ",

    "we have to show that this subsequence is the whole sequence . if it was not the whole sequence , we could find a subsequence @xmath288 satisfying the conditions for some face @xmath289 . then by the first part of the proof we would have @xmath290 as @xmath291 ( see lemma [ lem : he1_neq_he2 ] ) which is a contradiction .",

    "this fits with our conditions above as @xmath315 and so @xmath316 .",
    "the convergence of @xmath317 is independent of the value of @xmath318 , all sequences of this type converge to the same horofunction @xmath319 .",

    "if we take @xmath305 instead , this is not a problem any more .",

    "this also turns out when doing the calculation directly .",
    "one could guess that an easier condition for finding the appropriate face @xmath29 is to look at the limiting direction @xmath327 and to require it to be in @xmath29 .",

    "if we take @xmath322 instead this guaranties us unbounded distance to the relative boundary and because the projection is just the identity , all other requirements are also fulfilled , so @xmath333 , independent of @xmath15 as explained before .",

    "the easiest examples are sequences following straight lines and they are important enough to show the general behavior of the sequences . all sequences in a regular direction , that is , within the interior of the cone of a facet , collapse and converge to the horofunction associated to the dual vertex , independent of any translation or direction . for a sequence in a singular direction associated to a lower dimensional face @xmath29",
    ", we have the same collapsing behavior for the @xmath334-part and a blowing - up in the orthogonal direction @xmath40 , which is encoded by the point @xmath162 in the definition of @xmath11 .",
    "in the last part of this section we prove theorem [ thm : homeo ] . to do so , we need the map @xmath4 , which maps a finite - dimensional vector space to the interior of a convex polytope @xmath7 of the same dimension .",
    "the structure of the map is motivated by the moment map known from the theory of toric varieties .",
    "see for example @xcite for a description of it .",
    "although we do not have a lie group acting on a toric variety here , the map is the same . up to some signs which come from the definition of the dual unit ball , the same result as theorem [ thm : mc ]",

    "@xmath338 later we want to use @xmath46 as the unit ball of our vector space .",
    "as @xmath7 not necessarily contains the origin , @xmath339 is not @xmath7 any more , so to ensure that @xmath46 can be a unit ball , we consider a translated convex set properly lying around the origin and then take the dual of this set .",
    "the map @xmath4 behaves well under shifting as the following lemma shows .",
    "let @xmath342 be an arbitrary point . as no summand @xmath346 in the numerator can be zero",

    "it is obvious that the map is continuous . to show injectivity ,",
    "define the function @xmath348 then @xmath349 is the gradient of @xmath124 . to prove injectivity of @xmath4 on @xmath10",
