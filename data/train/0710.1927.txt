    "the weak decays of @xmath2 provide valuable information of the ckm parameter @xmath3 and serve as an ideal laboratory to study non - perturbative qcd effects in the heavy baryon system .",
    "recently the delphi collaboration reported their measurement on the slope parameter @xmath4 in the isgur - wise function and the the braching ratio of the exclusive semi - leptonic process @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this experimental measurement re - excites great theoretical interests in semi - leptonic decays of @xmath2 @xcite . from pdg06 @xcite , signals of several non - leptonic processes , such as @xmath6 have been observed .",
    "these processes are a good probe to test the factorization hypothesis which has been extensively explored in the b meson case @xcite .",
    "the forthcoming lhcb project is expected to accumulate large samples of the b - flavor hadrons and offer an opportunity to study in detail the @xmath2 decays . thus it probably is the time to investigate the @xmath2 weak decays more systematically . in this work ,",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath7 semi - leptonic and non - leptonic decays .    as in the b",
    "meson decays , the key for correctly evaluation on the rate of the semi - leptonic decays is how to properly derive the hadronic matrix element which is parameterized by the @xmath8 transition form factors .",
    "there are various approaches in the market to evaluate these form factors : the qcd sum rules @xcite , quark models @xcite , perturbative qcd approach @xcite _ etc._. in this work , we will study the heavy baryon form factors in the light - front quark model .",
    "the light - front quark model is a relativistic quark model based on the light - front qcd @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredient is the hadron light - front wave function which is explicitly lorentz - invariant .",
    "the hadron spin is constructed using the melosh rotation .",
    "the light - front approach has been widely applied to calculate various decay constants and form factors for the meson cases @xcite .",
    "different from the case discussed in @xcite where the light - front quark model was also employed , we adopt the diquark picture for baryons .",
    "it has been known for a long time that two quarks in a color - antitriplet state attract each other and may form a correlated diquark @xcite . indeed , the diquark picture of baryons is considered to be appropriate for the low momentum transfer processes @xcite . in the conventional quark model , the heavy baryon is composed of one heavy quark and two light quarks .",
    "the light spectator quarks participate only in the soft interactions as @xmath9 transits into @xmath10 , hence it is reasonable to employ the diquark picture for heavy baryons where the diquark serves as a whole spectator . concretely , under the diquark approximation , @xmath2 and @xmath10 are of the one - heavy - quark - one - light - diquark(ud ) structure which is analogous to the meson case and a considerable simplification in the calculations is expected .",
    "in fact , some non - perturbative interactions between the two light quarks can be effectively absorbed into the constituent diquark mass . in this phenomenological study",
    ", we use the rate of the semi - leptonic process @xmath11 which will be accurately measured at lhcb and future ilc , to constrain the light scalar diquark mass .    for the non - leptonic two - body decays @xmath12 where @xmath13 denote light mesons ,",
    "the amplitude is factorized to a product of the meson decay constant and @xmath7 transition form factors by the factorization assumption .",
    "because there only a color - allowed diagram is involved , the factorization assumption is believed to be reliable in the b meson case @xcite",
    ". however , the theoretical predictions on the non - leptonic two - body decays vary by a factor of 2 - 3 for various models .",
    "the main theoretical uncertainties arise from the model evaluations of the form factors . in order to reduce model dependence and obtain a more reliable prediction , we study the semi - leptonic decays and non - leptonic processes simultaneously .",
    "the present experimental data of the semi - leptonic decays ( although the errors are still quite sizable ) set constraints on the phenomenological parameters in the light - front approach . with these parameters , even though not very accurate yet , we evaluate the @xmath7 form factors and make predictions on the widths of the semi - leptonic decay @xmath14 and non - leptonic two - body decay @xmath15 where @xmath13 is a meson .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . in section",
    "ii , we formulate the form factors for the transition @xmath7 in the light - front approach .",
    "we will show that in the heavy quark limit , the resultant form factors are related to one universal isgur - wise function . in section iii ,",
    "the formulations of the decay ratios and the polarizations for the semi - leptonic and non - leptonic two - body decays are given . in section iv , we present our numerical results and all relevant input parameters are given explicitly .",

    "the semi - leptonic to non - leptonic @xmath208 decay ratio is well in accord with the experimental measurements .",
    "the non - leptonic decays , so far have not been accurately measured , and there are only upper bounds for some channels , so that it is still hard to judge the closeness of the present models to the physical reality yet .",
