    "in recent work @xcite we have introduced a model of fractal growth processes that interpolates between diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) @xcite and laplacian growth patterns @xcite , and employed this model to show that these processes are not in the same universality classes . the aim of this paper is to study the fractal properties of the resulting clusters . in particular we will be led to conjecture that laplacian growth is asymptotically of dimension 2 , and in this sense is not a fractal at all .",
    "this is in contradistinction to dla for which the dimension had been computed to be 1.713 ... @xcite .",
    "laplacian growth patterns are obtained when the boundary @xmath11 of a 2-dimensional domain is grown at a rate proportional to the gradient of a laplacian field @xmath12 . outside the domain @xmath13 , and each point of @xmath11 is advanced at a rate proportional to @xmath14 @xcite . in diffusion limited aggregation ( dla )",
    "@xcite a 2-dimensional cluster is grown by releasing fixed size random walkers from infinity , allowing them to walk around until they hit any particle belonging to the cluster . since the particles are released one by one and may take arbitrarily long time to hit the cluster , the probability field is quasi - stationary and in the complement of the cluster we have again @xmath13 .",
    "the boundary condition at infinity is the same for the two problems ; in radial geometry as @xmath15 the flux is @xmath16 .",
    "since the probability for a random walker to hit the boundary is again proportional to @xmath17 , one could think that in the asymptotic limit when the size of the particle is much smaller than the radius of the cluster , repeated growth events lead to a growth process which is similar to laplacian growth .",
    "of course , the ultraviolet regularizations in the two processes were taken different ; in studying laplacian growth one usually solves the problem with the boundary condition @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the surface tension and @xmath20 the local curvature of @xmath11 @xcite . without this ( or some other ) ultraviolet regularization laplacian growth reaches a singularity ( cusps ) in finite time @xcite . in dla",
    "the ultraviolet regularization is provided by the finite size of the random walkers . however , many researchers believed @xcite that this difference , which for very large clusters controls only the smallest scales of the fractal patterns , were not relevant , expecting the two models to lead to the clusters with the same asymptotic dimensions . while we argued recently that the difference in ultraviolet regularization is indeed not crucial @xcite , the two problems are nevertheless in two different universality classes . to establish this",
    "we have constructed a family of growth processes that includes dla and a discrete version of laplacian growth as extreme members , using the same ultraviolet regularization ( and see sect . 2 for a further discussion of the regularization ) .",
    "we thus exposed the essential difference between dla and laplacian growth .",
    "dla is grown serially , with the field being updated after each particle growth . on the other hand",
    "all boundary points of a laplacian pattern are advanced in parallel at once ( proportional to @xmath14 ) .",
    "we showed that this difference is fundamental to the asymptotic dimension , putting the two problems in different universality classes @xcite . here",
    "we wish to go further and suggest that laplacian growth patterns are 2-dimensional .",
    "in sect.2 we review briefly the two parameter model that had been introduced to establish these results .",
    "we discuss there the two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 that are used to interpolate between dla and laplacian growth . in sect.3 we analyze the generalized dimensions @xmath21 and relate them to the scaling of moments of objects which are natural to the theory . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss first a family of growth models which is a 1-parameter generalization of dla , ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and show that the fractality of dla is lost for some @xmath24 in favor of 2-dimensional growth patterns .",
    "it is not impossible that @xmath25 . for growth patterns in this family",
    "we derive a scaling relation @xmath7 . under some plausible assumptions we propose that for @xmath26 there exists another scaling relation , i.e. @xmath27 , which implies immediatly that @xmath8 .",
    "secondly we discuss the 1-parameter family of models that generalizes laplacian growth ( @xmath28 , @xmath23 and show that the above relation is not obtained here , leading to the existence of fractal patterns also for high values of @xmath1 . finally in sect .",
    "5 we reach the main conjecture of this paper , i.e. that laplacian growth patterns are 2-dimensional . in sect .",
    "6 we offer a discussion and some open questions that are left for future research .",
    "the method of iterated conformal maps for dla was introduced in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we have presented a generalization to parallel growth processes . we were interested in @xmath29 which conformally maps the exterior of the unit circle @xmath30 in the mathematical @xmath31plane onto the complement of the ( simply - connected ) cluster of @xmath32 particles in the physical @xmath33plane .",
    "the unit circle is mapped onto the boundary of the cluster . in what follows we use the fact that the gradient of the laplacian field @xmath34 is @xmath35 here",
    "@xmath36 is an arc - length parametrization of the boundary .",
    "the map @xmath29 is constructed recursively .",
    "suppose that we have already @xmath29 which maps to the exterior of a cluster of @xmath32 particles in the physical plane and we want to find the map @xmath37 after @xmath38 additional particles were added to its boundary _ at once _",
    ", each proportional in size to the local value of @xmath39 . to grow _ one _ such particle",
    "we employ the elementary map @xmath40 which transforms the unit circle to a circle with a semi - spherical  bump \" of linear size @xmath41 around the point @xmath42 : @xmath43 -1 \\right \\ } ^{1/2 } \\\\     & & \\phi_{\\lambda,\\theta } ( w ) = e^{i \\theta } \\phi_{\\lambda,0}(e^{-i     \\theta }     w ) \\ , ,     \\label{eq - f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "if we update the field after the addition of this single particle , then @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the point on which the @xmath46-th particle is grown and @xmath47 is the size of the grown particle divided by the jacobian of the map , @xmath48 , at that point .",
    "the map @xmath49 adds on a new semi - circular bump to the image of the unit circle under @xmath29 . the bumps in the @xmath33-plane",
    "simulate the accreted particles in the physical space formulation of the growth process .",
    "for the height of the bump to be proportional to @xmath50 we need to choose its area proportional to @xmath51 ( see eq .",
    "( [ gradient ] ) ) , or @xmath52 with @xmath53 these rules produce a dla cluster , for which the particles are of constant area . with @xmath28",
    "we grow bumps in the physical space whose linear scale is proportional the gradient of the field @xmath54 , as is appropriate for laplacian growth .",
    "next , to grow @xmath38 ( non - overlapping ) particles in parallel , we accrete them without updating the conformal map .",
    "in other words , to add a new layer of @xmath38 particles when the cluster contains @xmath55 particles , we need to choose @xmath38 angles on the unit circle @xmath56 . at these angles",
    "we grow bumps which in the physical space have the wanted linear scale ( ranging from constant to proportional to the gradient of the field ) : @xmath57 after the @xmath38 particles were added , the conformal map and thus the field should be updated . in updating , we will use @xmath38 compositions of the elementary map @xmath58 .",
    "of course , every composition effects a reparametrization of the unit circle , which has to be taken into account . to do this",
    ", we define a series @xmath59 according to @xmath60 next we define the conformal map used in the next layer growth according to @xmath61 in this way we achieve the growth at the images under @xmath62 of the points @xmath56 .",
    "to compute the @xmath63 series from a given @xmath64 series we use eq.([compose ] ) to rewrite eq.([tilde ] ) in the form @xmath65 the inverse map @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 with @xmath68[\\omega^2-(1+\\lambda ) ] } } { 1-(1+\\lambda)\\omega^2 } \\ , \\label{inverse - map}\\ ] ] where the positive root is taken for re @xmath69 and the negative root for re @xmath70 .",
    "evidently , laplacian growth calls for choosing the series @xmath56 such as to have full coverage of the unit circle ( implying the same for the boundary @xmath11 ) . on the other hand dla",
    "calls for growing a single particle before updating the field .",
    "since it was shown @xcite that in dla growth @xmath71 decreases on the average when @xmath32 increases , in the limit of large clusters dla is consistent with vanishingly small coverage of the unit circle . to interpolate between these two cases",
    "we introduce a parameter that serves to distinguish one growth model from the other , giving us a 2-parameter control ( the other parameter is @xmath0 ) .",
    "this parameter is the _ degree of coverage_. since the area covered by the pre - image of the @xmath32-th particle on the unit circle is approximately @xmath72 , we introduce the parameter @xmath73 ( in @xcite we showed how to measure the coverage exactly ) . since this is the fraction of the unit circle which is covered in each layer , the limit of laplacian growth is obtained with @xmath74 .",
    "dla is asymptotically consistent with @xmath75 .",
    "of course , the two models differ also in the size of the growing bumps , with dla having fixed size particles , ( @xmath22 in eq.([lambdanew ] ) ) , and laplacian growth having particles proportional to @xmath14 ( @xmath28 in eq.([layer ] ) ) .",
    "together with @xmath76 we have a two parameter control on the parallel growth dynamics , with dla and laplacian growth occupying two corners of the @xmath77 plane , at the points ( 0,0 ) and ( 2,1 ) respectively .",
    "obviously , the partially serial growth within the layer introduces an additional freedom which is the _ order _ of placement of the bumps on the unit circle . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that the order is in fact immaterial as far as the asymptotic fractal properties of the clusters are concerned .",
    "accordingly , we will take random choices of @xmath78 with a rule of skipping overlaps .",
    "we should note that in our approach the regularization of putative singularities is not achieved with surface tension , but by having a minimal size bump , similarly to the regularization of dla .",
    "our rules of growth with @xmath28 and @xmath79 chosen once and for all , guarantee that every layer of growth has exactly the same area .",
    "this in the continuous time laplacian growth model translates to a particular choice of the time step @xmath80 .",
    "clearly , one has freedom in choosing @xmath80 , or of the size @xmath79 in each layer , as long as this does not affect the nature of the growth . in particular we can have @xmath79 chosen such that the maximal physical bump is of constant area .",
    "once @xmath79 is chosen , the sharpest feature that can be achieved is a bump of size @xmath79 , and the worst possible  singularity \" is a line of such bumps , exactly as in dla .",
    "thus the putative cusp singularity of laplacian growth is avoided in a manner that is identical for all the growth models in our 2-parameter family .",
    "the conformal map @xmath81 admits a laurent expansion @xmath82 the coefficient of the linear term is the laplace radius , and was shown to scale like @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the area of the cluster , @xmath85 note that for @xmath22 this and equation ( [ lambdanew ] ) imply that @xmath86 . indeed for @xmath22",
    "this estimate had been carefully analyzed and substantiated ( up to a factor ) in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand @xmath87 is given analytically by @xmath88 and therefore can be determined very accurately .",
    "the conclusion from the calculations presented in @xcite is that for @xmath89 the fractal dimension of the growth patterns depends continuously on the parameters , growing monotonically upon decreasing @xmath0 or increasing @xmath76 .",
    "it is quite obvious why increasing @xmath76 should increase the dimension . by forbidding particles to overlap",
    "we simply force them into the fjords , not allowing them to hit the tips only ( as is highly probable ) . also decreasing @xmath0 increases the dimension , since we grow larger particles into the fjords , whereas increasing @xmath0 reduces the size of particles added to fjords and increases the size of particles that accrete onto tips .",
    "in particular we argued that dla and our discretized laplacian growth can not have the same dimensions , putting them in different universality classes . in the rest of this paper",
    "we make these observations more quantitative and precise .",
    "the fractal dimension in the @xmath90 family of models , @xmath91 , is introduced as the exponent relating the area of the cluster @xmath92 to its linear scale ( which is measured by the ( dimensionless ) laplace radius @xmath87 ) : @xmath93 in this equation @xmath94 . the multifractal exponents @xcite are defined in analogy to those for dla in terms of the moments of the ( dimensionless ) electric field @xmath95 on the boundary of the cluster @xcite , @xmath96 where @xmath97 represents the harmonic average for the @xmath98 clusters in question .",
    "note that these exponents are for a fixed size partition with boxes of length @xmath99 , with asymptotics for an infinitely large cluster .",
    "a supremum over arbitrary partitions may lead to different exponents , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this result translates immediately @xcite to the multifractal fluctuations of the bump areas @xmath71 added in the mathematical plane . as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the field computed at @xmath102 .",
    "we therefore write @xmath103 specifically we can derive the following important moments @xmath104 where naturally all the dimensions are functions of @xmath105 . we can also estimate the way in which the maximal bump areas scale @xmath106    consider now the addition of one layer of @xmath38 particles to the growing cluster . we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ defc ] ) as @xmath107 where we have introduced the notation @xmath108 to represent the average over a layer of @xmath38 particles : @xmath109 for our considerations below it is important to relate the layer averages @xmath108 to harmonic averages @xmath110 .",
    "this relationship may very well depend on the value of @xmath0 .",

    "nevertheless , even for the case @xmath117 , if we perform a running average on the layer average data , we converge very well onto the harmonic average .",

    "[ clusters0 ] , [ clusters-1]-[clusters2 ] are grown with a fixed size @xmath79 .",
    "consequently , for @xmath164 the actual mean size of the bumps in the physical space decreases as the cluster grows , while it increases for @xmath165 .",
    "this may lead to worries , i.e. that for @xmath164 the growth arrests and that for @xmath165 the increase in the size of the bumps leads to coverage of fjords , such that the 2-dimensional patterns shown in fig .",
    "[ clusters-1 ] would be an artifact . to disperse these worries",
    "we have considered alternative growth algorithms with varying the size of @xmath79 .",
    "the first such algorithm is obtained by requiring that the total area covered in each layer of growth is constant , i.e. @xmath166 note that for constant coverage @xmath1 this rule coincides with fixed values of @xmath79 for @xmath28 ( cf .",
    "eq.([defc ] ) ) . in the second algorithm",
    "we choose the maximal size of the bump in the physical plane to be constant from layer to layer : @xmath167 this rule coincides with fixed values of @xmath79 for @xmath22 .",
    "we found that in all cases the patterns shown above remain invariant to the change of the algorithms .",
    "thus we submit that the figures shown can be fully trusted .    to find the line that separates fractal from 2-dimensional patterns we estimate the dimensions directly from log - log plots of @xmath168 vs. @xmath84 .",
    "we have seen above that such estimates are _ lower _ bounds to the actual asymptotic dimension .",
    "as these logarithmic plots are invariably concave , we can use the slope at the largest values of area available as a measure for the lower bound on the dimension . in fig .",
    "[ phasedi ] we show the three lines obtained by searching , for a given value of @xmath1 , the value of @xmath0 for which for the first time the dimension estimated from @xmath168 vs. @xmath84 crosses the value @xmath169 ( upper curve ) , @xmath170 ( middle line ) and @xmath171 ( lower curve ) .",
    "we propose that the last two lines may very well be already beyond the true line that separates fractal from @xmath8 asymptotic dimension . from the discussion of sect .",
    "iv a we can not even exclude the possibility that the transition line obfuscates the @xmath22 line .",
    "all the region below the lower line is almost surely representing patterns of @xmath8 , but we strongly believe that this is the case also for the middle line .",
    "the lines were obtained by finding , as explained , the values of @xmath0 yielding d=1.90 , 1.95 and 1.99 respectively , and then fitting to the points a quadratic function .",
    "next we extrapolated the three fits to values of @xmath1 that are not readily available in our algorithm .",
    "the three fit lines intersect the @xmath28 line at @xmath172 , 0.78 and @xmath173 respectively .",
    "we thus propose that the value @xmath158 for @xmath28 is comfortably within the region of 2-dimensional patterns in this phase diagram .     plane .",
    "the data points in crosses , triangles and circles represent values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for which the radius - area relationship predicts @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 respectively .",
    "the lines are quadratic fits .",
    "we propose that the region below the lines represents 2-dimensional growth patterns , and see text for details . ]",
    "we have presented a careful numerical study of a 2-parameter model of growth patterns that generalizes and interpolates between diffusion limited aggregation and laplacian growth patterns .",
    "the model gives rise to a rich plethora of growth patterns , with fractal dimensions that depend on the values of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath22 and @xmath143 we obtain dla .",
    "laplacian growth patterns have @xmath28 and @xmath158 , but we can not probe the value @xmath158 within our algorithm . since our aim , in part , is to demonstrate that laplacian growth patterns are not fractal , we resorted to examining the phase diagram @xmath4 .",
    "we established , on the basis of scaling arguments , simulations and visual observations , that this phase diagram contains a line of transition between fractal and 2-dimensional growth patterns .",
    "we have estimated the position of this line , and demonstrated that laplacian growth patterns belong safely in the region of 2-dimensional growth patterns .",
    "one should point out that the statement that laplacian growth are 2-dimensional does not mean that it is a growing disk . to the eye",
    "the patterns can look fractal , and in fact radius - area log - log plots might initially even indicate that the dimension is low , and maybe of the order of the dimension of dla .",
    "deep fjords may exist in the structure .",
    "the relevant question is whether the growing branches of the structure contain substance ( area ) and whether this area is growing relatively with the growth of the pattern .",
    "the growth pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ clustersbeta1 ] panel d is a case in point .",
    "it looks fractal to the naked eye , but careful examination shows that the branches have area .",
    "thus one needs to decide whether this area is due to some ultraviolet cutoff length , or does it grow systematically beyond what is expected on the basis of the existence of such a cutoff .    before closing",
    "we reiterate that our demonstration that laplacian growth patterns are 2-dimensional is not direct .",
    "we can not , within our algorithm , grow @xmath158 patterns .",
    "we therefore leave this at the moment as a conjecture .",
    "it remains a theoretical challenge to show that this conjecture is indeed provable by direct mathematical analysis .",
    "we also leave for future work the question whether the @xmath22 line represents 2-dimensional growth patterns for all @xmath89 .",
    "finally we propose that future work may make use of the fractal patterns along the line @xmath143 , @xmath164 for further fundamental studies of dla and related phenomena .",
