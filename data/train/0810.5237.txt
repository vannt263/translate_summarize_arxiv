    "neutron star which is highly compact stellar objects is a result of supernova explosion .",
    "the structure properties of this object , especially its maximum mass , is of a great interest for astrophysicists .",
    "since the compactness parameter for a neutron star is about @xmath0 , its structure should be studied using the general theory of relativity .",
    "in fact , the computation of the structure properties of a neutron star can be derived using the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation @xcite .    just after the supernova collapse , a newly - born neutron star called protoneutron star is formed . at these stages ,",
    "the neutron stars are rich in leptons .",
    "this is due to the fact that the neutrinos are trapped in the protoneutron star matter .",
    "the temperature of protoneutron star is greater than @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the high temperature of these stages can not be neglected with respect to the fermi temperature throughout the calculation of its structure .",
    "depending on the total number of nucleons , a protoneutron star evolves either to black hole or to stable neutron star @xcite .",
    "therefore , computation of the maximum mass of protoneutron star is of crucial importance .    in recent years , we have investigated the properties of neutron star matter @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we intend to compute the structure properties of protoneutron star at different stages employing the lowest order constrained variational approach using the modern @xmath2 potential @xcite .",
    "in this section , we give the formalism of calculation for the protoneutron star matter equation of state .",
    "we write the total energy per baryon ( @xmath3 ) as the sum of contributions from leptons and nucleons , @xmath4 the contribution from the energy of leptons is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total number density of nucleons and @xmath7 is the fermi - dirac distribution function , where @xmath8 defined , @xmath9 we calculate the contribution from the energy of nucleons using the lowest order constrained variational method .",
    "we consider up to the two - body term in the cluster expansion for the energy functional , @xmath10 the one - body energy @xmath11 is @xmath12 the two - body energy @xmath13 is @xmath14\\right ] + f(12)v(12)f(12)\\}\\mid ij>_a,\\ ] ] where f(12 ) and v(12 ) are the two - body correlation function and nucleon - nucleon potential , respectively .",
    "v(12 ) has the following general form @xcite , @xmath15 finally , we minimize the two - body energy , @xmath13 , with respect to the variation in the two - body correlation function subjected to the normalization constraint . from this minimization",
    ", we get a set of euler - lagrange differential equations .",
    "the correlation functions are calculated by solving these differential equations and then , the two - body energy , @xmath13 , is computed @xcite .",
    "this leads to the equations of state used in our present work .",
    "in this section , we calculate the structure properties of neutron star in the different stages just after its formation by numerically integrating the tov equation .",
    "the structure properties of neutron star in these stages such as maximum mass , radius and temperature profile are calculated using the modern microscopic equations of state derived from constrained variational method employing the argonne @xmath16 potential @xcite as the inter - nucleonic interaction . at low densities",
    ", we also consider a hot dense matter model and use the equations of state obtained by gondek et al .",
    "@xcite and strobel et al .",
    "@xcite . here is our results for different stages .",
    "since a neutron star , at the beginning of its lifetime ( protoneutron star ) , is opaque with respect to neutrinos therefore , it contains a high lepton fraction ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , at this stage of neutron star , the entropy per baryon ( @xmath19 ) is nearly constant throughout the star , @xmath20 .",
    "since , we are also dealing with uncharged neutron star matter , the lepton and proton fractions should be equal @xcite .",
    "our results for the pressure of protoneutron star matter as a function of mass density are presented in fig . 1 at entropies @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is seen that for a fixed value of entropy , the pressure of protoneutron star matter increases by decreasing the lepton fraction .",
    "we see that for a given value of lepton fraction , the equation of state for @xmath25 is stiffer than for @xmath26 . in fig . 1",
    ", we have compared our results with those of gondek et al .",
    "@xcite and strobel et al .",
    "we have seen that the results of gondek et al .",
    "@xcite are nearly in agreement with our results for @xmath27 and @xmath24 .",
    "but , the equations of state calculated by strobel et al .",
    "@xcite are stiffer than those of ours .    in fig .",
    "2 , we have presented the gravitational mass of protoneutron star as a function of central mass density for different values of entropy and lepton fraction . from fig .",
    "2 , we can see that the gravitational mass increases by increasing the central mass density .",
    "it is shown that for different cases of entropy and lepton fraction , the gravitational mass exhibits different mass limits ( maximum mass ) as given in table 1 . from this table , the decreasing of maximum mass by decreasing the entropy and increasing the lepton fraction is seen . in fig . 2 and table 1 , the results of gondek et al .",
    "@xcite and strobel et al .",
    "@xcite are also given for comparison .",
    "it is seen that these results are different from our calculations .    the radius of protoneutron star as a function of central mass density is shown in fig . 3 for different entropies and lepton fractions .",
    "it is seen that as the central mass density increases , the radius decreases very rapidly and then reaches a nearly constant value .",
    "the radius of protoneutron star corresponding to the maximum mass for different entropies and lepton fractions is given in table 2 .",
    "it can be seen that the stiffer equation of state leads to the relatively higher radius .",
    "the variations of temperature throughout the protoneutron star matter with respect to the radial coordinate ( @xmath28 ) are presented in figs . 4 and 5 for @xmath29 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we can see from the figs . 4 and 5 that the temperature is decreasing slowly by increasing @xmath28 , but it drops rapidly near the protoneutron star crust .",
    "after complete deleptonization , neutrino trapped within the hot interior matter of neutron star do not affect the beta stability condition and therefore the lepton fraction is determined from the beta - equilibrium criteria @xcite . in this stage , we have calculated the structure properties of protoneutron star for both isentropic and isothermal paths .      for different values of entropy ,",

    "the increasing of gravitational mass by increasing both central mass density and entropy is seen . as it is shown in fig .",

    "we see that the radius decreases very rapidly by increasing the central mass density and then exhibits a nearly constant value .",
    "the radius corresponding to the maximum mass of beta stable protoneutron star for @xmath26 and @xmath25 are also given in table 3 .",
    "this shows the decreasing of radius with respect to decreasing entropy .",
    "the temperature of beta - stable protoneutron star matter as a function of radial coordinate ( @xmath28 ) is shown in fig . 9 for different entropies . the same as fig.s 4 and 5",
    ", we see that the temperature decreases slowly by increasing @xmath28 , but drops rapidly near the beta - stable protoneutron star crust .",
    "we are now able to do the above calculations for the protoneutron star in the beta - equilibrium case at different isothermal paths .",
