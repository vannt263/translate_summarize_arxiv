    "our main results theorem  [ mainthm ] ( section  [ dynamicsp ] ) then collects the findings of sections  [ ss1]-[dynamicsp ] in one statement about the limit cycles of the switched system ( [ fg])-([rl ] ) .",
    "applications were a significant driving force towards this paper . a toy mechanical model that illustrates theorem  [ mainthm ] is considered in section  [ appl1 ] , where following @xcite we just incorporated a relay ( hysteresis ) switching of the external force in the standard mass - spring oscillator , thus making the dynamics switching between two globally attracting equilibria . in section  [ appl2 ]",
    "we apply theorem  [ mainthm ] to establish the existence of a limit cycle in an anti - lock braking system ( abs ) with a two - phase controller of the pressure valves .",

    "indeed , spotting a suitable expansion and a suitable domain for the poincar map @xmath46 of the switched system ( [ fg])-([rl ] ) ( so that @xmath46 does nt contain square - root terms ) was the main difficulty in this paper .",
    "we stress that the approach of this paper does nt permit us to analyze the dynamics outside the suitable domain mentioned above , where the effect of a square - root singularity may come into play ( the interested reader can consult @xcite for the role of square - root maps and square - root singularities in the analysis of nonsmooth systems ) .",
