    "in recent years substantial progress has been made in understanding non - perturbative string dynamics .",
    "in particular , in ten dimensions there are five consistent superstring theories .",
    "the first four , type iia , type iib , @xmath3 heterotic and @xmath4 heterotic , are theories of oriented closed strings .",
    "type i superstring is a theory of both unoriented closed plus open strings .",
    "perturbatively , these five theories are distinct .",
    "nonetheless , these theories exhibit a web of ( conjectured ) dualities which all seem to point to an underlying unified description .",
    "most of these dualities are intrinsically non - perturbative and often allow to map non - perturbative phenomena in one theory to perturbative phenomena in another theory .",
    "the four oriented closed string theories and their compactifications are relatively well understood as far as perturbative formulation is concerned .",
    "conformal field theory and modular invariance serve as guiding principles for perturbative model building in closed string theories .",
    "type i , however , lacks modular invariance .",
    "moreover , conformal field theories on world - sheets with boundaries ( invariably present in open string theories ) are still poorly understood .",
    "these have been some of the main reasons for lack of as deep understanding of perturbative type i compactifications as in closed string theories .    in the past years",
    "various unoriented closed plus open string vacua have been constructed using orientifold techniques .",
    "type iib orientifolds are generalized orbifolds that involve world - sheet parity reversal along with geometric symmetries of the theory @xcite . orientifolding procedure results in an unoriented closed string theory .",
    "consistency then generically requires introducing open strings that can be viewed as starting and ending on d - branes @xcite . in particular , type i compactifications on toroidal orbifolds can be viewed as type iib orientifolds with a certain choice of the orientifold projection .",
    "global chan - paton charges associated with d - branes manifest themselves as a gauge symmetry in space - time .",
    "the orientifold techniques have been successfully applied to the construction of six dimensional @xmath0 space - time supersymmetric orientifolds of type iib compactified on orbifold limits of k3 ( that is , toroidal orbifolds @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "these orientifold models generically contain more than one tensor multiplet and/or enhanced gauge symmetries from d5-branes in their massless spectra , and , therefore , describe six dimensional vacua which are non - perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint .",
    "the orientifold construction has subsequently been generalized to four dimensional @xmath0 space - time supersymmetric compactifications @xcite .",
    "several such orientifolds have been constructed . some of these models , namely , the @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite orbifold models have perturbative heterotic duals @xcite .",
    "others , such as the @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite orbifold models are non - perturbative from the heterotic viewpoint @xcite as they contain d5-branes .",
    "in particular , the @xmath11 orbifold model of @xcite and the @xmath12 model of @xcite are the first known examples of consistent chiral @xmath0 string vacua in four dimensions that are non - perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint .    despite the above developments at some point it became clear that our understanding of orientifolds was incomplete .",
    "in particular , in some of the models discussed in @xcite the tadpole cancellation conditions ( derived using the perturbative orientifold approach , namely , via a straightforward generalization of the six dimensional tadpole cancellation conditions to four dimensions ) allowed for no solutions .",
    "this appeared to be a distress signal indicating that a better understanding of the orientifold construction was called for .",
    "recently , some progress has been made in this direction @xcite .",
    "in particular , in @xcite conditions necessary for world - sheet consistency of six and four dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric type iib orientifolds were studied . it was argued that in most cases orientifolds contain sectors which are non - perturbative ( _ i.e. _ , these sectors have no world - sheet description ) .",
    "these sectors can be thought of as arising from d - branes wrapping various collapsed 2-cycles in the orbifold .",
    "in particular , such non - perturbative states are present in the `` anomalous '' models of ref @xcite ( as well as in other examples of this type recently discussed in ref @xcite ) .",
    "this resolves the corresponding `` puzzles '' .",
    "certain world - sheet consistency conditions in four dimensional cases ( which are automatically satisfied in the six dimensions ) were pointed out in @xcite which indicate that the only four dimensional ( abelian ) orientifolds that have perturbative description are those of type iib compactified on the @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 and @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "( in this paper we will add one more orbifold group to this list .",
    "this is the only non - abelian orbifold group for which the corresponding orientifold has a world - sheet description . )",
    "in particular , none of the other models considered in @xcite have perturbative orientifold description , and even in the models with all tadpoles cancelled the massless spectra given in @xcite miss certain non - perturbative states .",
    "these conclusions of @xcite are supported by various checks performed in @xcite and @xcite . in particular , using type i - heterotic duality @xcite in the spirit of @xcite as well as f - theory @xcite picture , it was possible to determine the world - sheet consistency conditions , that is , the conditions under which the non - perturbative states from wrapped d - branes are either absent or become massive and decouple from the massless spectrum .",
    "this gave rise to the list of orbifolds mentioned above .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite utilized the fact that the world - sheet consistency conditions are local statements about orientifold planes and d - branes near orbifold singularities ( as far as geometry is concerned ) to perform independent checks of the conclusions in @xcite .",
    "these _ a priori _ independent checks appear to be rather convincing as they are in one - to - one correspondence with each other .",
    "although the number of perturbative type iib orientifolds in four dimensions appears to be rather constrained , it is important to understand all the cases at hand .",
    "the cases of most interest are those with d5-branes as they correspond to non - perturbative heterotic vacua .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 orientifolds have mostly been studied in the context of zero ns - ns @xmath14-field background . in this paper",
    "we study all perturbative @xmath0 orientifolds with and without the @xmath14-field backgrounds .",
    "we systematically classify these models which includes the derivation of their complete massless spectra .",
    "we also compute the renormalizable couplings in the superpotentials of these models .",
    "this paper therefore completes the program of constructing and understanding such compactifications .    in fig.1",
    "we have drawn a schematic picture of the space of four dimensional @xmath0 type i and heterotic vacua .",
    "the region @xmath15 corresponds to perturbative type i vacua .",
    "the region @xmath16 corresponds to perturbative heterotic vacua .",
    "the vacua in the region @xmath17 are perturbative from both the type i and heterotic viewpoints .",
    "the region @xmath18 contains both non - perturbative type i and heterotic vacua . in this paper",
    "we are concentrating on the region @xmath15 .",
    "the region @xmath16 is relatively well understood .",
    "the ultimate challenge is to understand compactifications which are non - perturbative from both the type i and heterotic viewpoints , that is , the region @xmath18 .",
    "it should contain the bulk of interesting type i / heterotic vacua .",
    "understanding such compactifications would certainly shed some light on the underlying unifying structure of string theory .",
    "in this section we briefly review some useful facts about orientifolds . in particular , we discuss the effect of non - zero ns - ns @xmath14-field .    consider type iib string theory compactified on @xmath19 where the orbifold group @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is a finite discrete subgroup of @xmath22 that acts crystallographically on @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath24 is an orbifold calabi - yau three - fold with @xmath22 holonomy .",
    "the resulting four dimensional theory has @xmath25 supersymmetry .",
    "consider the @xmath26 orientifold of this theory , where @xmath26 is the world - sheet parity reversal .",
    "the orientifold group is then @xmath27 .",
    "the orientifold theory has @xmath0 supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "the unoriented closed string sector contains @xmath28 chiral supermultiplets s ( if any ) but are neutral with respect to other subgroups of the chan - paton gauge group - see below for more details . ] , where @xmath29 are the corresponding hodge numbers of the calabi - yau three - fold @xmath24 .",
    "let us first discuss the cases with zero ns - ns @xmath14-field ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "note that we have an orientifold 9-plane corresponding to the element @xmath26 of the orientifold group . to cancel the corresponding r - r charge",
    "we must introduce 32 d9-branes .",
    "( the number 32 of d9-branes is required by the corresponding _ untwisted _ tadpole cancellation conditions . )",
    "if @xmath32 has a @xmath33 subgroup , then we also have an orientifold 5-plane .",
    "this corresponds to the element @xmath34 of the orientifold group , where @xmath35 is the generator of this @xmath33 subgroup .",
    "there is a different set of d5-branes corresponding to each @xmath33 subgroup of @xmath32 .",
    "each set consists of 32 d5-branes .",
    "( the number 32 of d5-branes is required by the corresponding tadpole cancellation conditions .",
    "this also follows from t - duality between d9- and d5-branes . )",
    "we need to specify the action of the orbifold group @xmath32 on the chan - paton factors corresponding to the d9- and d5-branes .",
    "this action is given by the corresponding chan - paton matrices which we collectively refer to as @xmath36 , where the superscript @xmath37 refers to the corresponding d9- or d5-branes .",
    "note that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of d - branes labelled by @xmath37 .",
    "the world - sheet consistency of an orientifold theory requires that all massless tadpoles cancel .",
    "these tadpoles arise at one - loop level from the following three sources : the klein bottle , annulus , and mbius strip amplitudes .",
    "the factorization property of string theory implies that the tadpole cancellation conditions read ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) : @xmath40 here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are ( model dependent ) numerical coefficients of order 1 . in the following",
    "we will explicitly give the solutions of these tadpole cancellation conditions for each model .",
    "( a detailed discussion of the tadpole cancellation conditions used in this paper can be found in @xcite . )",
    "naively , it might seem that the @xmath26 orientifolds of type iib on @xmath1 should have a world - sheet description for any choice of @xmath43 which acts crystallographically on @xmath23 .",
    "this is , however , not the case .",
    "as discussed at length in @xcite , in most cases orientifolds contain sectors which are non - perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint , that is , such sectors have no world - sheet description .",
    "these sectors arise from d - branes wrapping various ( collapsed ) two - cycles in the orbifold .",
    "however , using type i - heterotic duality @xcite along the lines of @xcite together with f - theory @xcite considerations , it is possible to determine for which orbifold groups the corresponding orientifold is perturbative @xcite .",
    "the arguments of @xcite are supported by various independent checks performed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the number of such orbifold groups turns out rather limited .",
    "in particular , there are only six abelian subgroups of @xmath22 for which the corresponding orientifolds have perturbative description .",
    "these are the @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 and @xmath11 @xcite , and @xmath12 @xcite cases .",
    "there is one other such case which has not been discussed previously : this is a non - abelian orientifold model considered in section [ na ] of this paper .",
    "these seven cases exhaust the list of orbifold groups for which the corresponding orientifolds can be described perturbatively as world - sheet theories .",
    "in the remainder of this paper we will confine our attention to these orbifolds .",
    "the above perturbative orientifolds have been mostly discussed in the context of zero ns - ns @xmath14-field case with non - zero @xmath14-field backgrounds has been briefly discussed in @xcite .",
    "also , the @xmath11 model of @xcite with a certain non - zero @xmath14-field configuration has been recently discussed in @xcite in a phenomenological context . ] .",
    "the goal of this paper is to systematically study all perturbative orientifolds with @xmath0 supersymmetry in four dimensions orientifolds with and without the @xmath14-field has been performed in @xcite . ] .",
    "thus , we will also consider the above orientifolds in the presence of non - zero ns - ns @xmath14-field .",
    "before we turn to the construction of the corresponding models , let us briefly review the effect of the @xmath14-field on the orientifold spectrum .",
    "note that the untwisted ns - ns two - form @xmath44 is odd under the orientifold projection @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that the corresponding states are projected out of the closed string massless spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , certain quantized vacuum expectation values of @xmath44 are allowed .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "let @xmath44 be normalized such that it is defined up to a unit shift : @xmath45 . with this normalization ,",
    "the only two values of @xmath44 invariant under @xmath26 are 0 and @xmath46 , hence quantization of @xmath44 .    the effect of quantized @xmath14-field in toroidal compactifications of type i string theory has been studied in @xcite ( and also more recently in @xcite ) .",
    "this discussion has been recently generalized to six - dimensional orbifold compactifications in @xcite - field have been studied in @xcite . ] .",
    "the results of @xcite can be generalized to four dimensional orbifold compactifications .",
    "here we briefly state the key facts relevant for the subsequent discussions , and refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "thus , let @xmath47 denote the rank of the @xmath48 matrix @xmath44 .",
    "( note that due to antisymmetry of @xmath44 , its rank @xmath49 . ) as discussed in @xcite , the numbers of d9- and d5-branes ( of each type ) are @xmath50 .",
    "( for @xmath51 we have the usual number 32 of each type of branes . ) for @xmath52 the untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions for the d9-branes _ a priori _ allow the orientifold projection @xmath26 to be of either @xmath53 or @xmath54 type , that is , before taking into account the orbifold projections ( and the corresponding twisted tadpole cancellation conditions ) the resulting @xmath55 toroidal compactification of type i has the gauge group @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "( here we are using the convention where the rank of @xmath58 is @xmath2 . ) note that for @xmath51 only the @xmath53 type projection is allowed for d9-branes",
    ". as to the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions , the following modifications occur for @xmath52 .",
    "suppose @xmath59 is an element of the orbifold group @xmath32 such that the fixed point locus of the corresponding twist is of real dimension two .",
    "then , if the components of @xmath44 corresponding to this locus form a non - zero @xmath60 matrix ( that is , an antisymmetric matrix of rank 2 ) , the coefficient @xmath41 in ( [ bc ] ) is _ reduced _ by a factor of 2 ( compared with the case @xmath51 ) .",
    "none of the other twisted tadpoles get modified .",
    "( however , the type of the orientifold projection ( _ i.e. _ , whether it is of the @xmath53 or @xmath54 type ) is fixed by the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions . )",
    "another important point is multiplicity of states in sectors corresponding to open strings stretched between different species of d - branes .",
    "thus , consider a model with d9- plus d@xmath61-branes .",
    "( as we will see in the subsequent sections , there can be only one , two or three different types of d5-branes . )",
    "the states in the @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) sectors transform in the bi - fundamental irreps of the corresponding gauge groups .",
    "these bi - fundamental irreps appear with the multiplicity @xmath65 .",
    "( thus , for @xmath51 this multiplicity is one . )",
    "this multiplicity of states in these sectors is due to ( see below for more details ) the @xmath66 discrete symmetry ( which is trivial in the @xmath51 case ) present in these models .",
    "this discrete symmetry will be important in determining the superpotential in the models with @xmath52 .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the four dimensional orientifolds with non - zero @xmath14-field .",
    "in this section we will discuss the @xmath26 orientifolds of type iib compactified on @xmath1 , where @xmath32 is one of the six abelian orbifolds mentioned in the previous section , namely , @xmath10 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "for completeness we will discuss all the models including those with zero @xmath14-field .",
    "this should make the discussion of the cases with @xmath52 easier to follow .",
    "for each of these models we will give the _ renormalizable _",
    "( if any ) terms in the superpotential .",
    "( higher dimensional terms are not difficult to reproduce . )    in all the cases except @xmath8 we can for simplicity assume that the six - torus @xmath23 factorizes into a product of three two - tori : @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 , @xmath69 be the complex coordinates parametrizing these two - tori .",
    "then the orbifold group elements @xmath59 are @xmath70 @xmath22 matrices acting on @xmath68 : @xmath71 . moreover , for our purposes here it will suffice can be studied similarly and are not difficult to work out .",
    "the corresponding open string sectors are the same as in the block - diagonal cases .",
    "the closed string sectors are generically different as the hodge numbers of the corresponding orbifold calabi - yau three - fold depend on the precise form of the @xmath44 matrix . ] to assume that the matrix @xmath44 is block - diagonal : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is an antisymmetric @xmath60 matrix with @xmath74 . here",
    "we assume that the internal directions @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 correspond to the complex coordinates @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively . note that there is no restriction on @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 other than that they take values 0 or @xmath46 .    in the @xmath8 case",
    "the requirement that the orbifold group act crystallographically on @xmath23 implies that @xmath23 can not be factorized . also , the rank of the @xmath14-field can only be either @xmath51 or @xmath84 .",
