    "the quest towards experimental studies of quantum behavior in nanomechanical systems @xcite has progressed fast in recent years .",
    "a breakthrough took place last year , when the quantum ground state was demonstrated by the cleland group @xcite , using a 6 ghz piezoelectric mode in resonance with an electrical quantum system made out of josephson junctions .",
    "in general , the difficulty of bringing mechanical degrees of freedom to the quantum limit is due to the challenges posed by several issues . as usual , for quantum - mechanical phenomena to become observable , the thermal energy @xmath0 has to be much lower than the characteristic oscillation energy @xmath1 .",
    "the flexural mode frequencies rarely exceed one ghz , and there are no such strongly nonlinear mechanical phenomena analogous to the josephson tunneling .",
    "hence , nonlinearity which helps to isolate quantum behavior becomes prominent only by the means of reducing the linear energy , with an accompanying reduction in frequency and stringent requirements for temperature . also , the mechanical zero - point vibrations are orders of magnitude smaller than the typical length scales encountered in solid - state physics .",
    "macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) refers to quantum tunneling in a degree of freedom involving a macroscopic number of particles .",
    "this is how josephson junctions were shown to portray quantum behavior more than 20 years ago , namely , by observing the phase to escape from the metastable minimum via mqt @xcite .",
    "josephson junctions display strong nonlinearity at the zero - point energy scale , and the frequencies typically reside in the range of tens of ghz , and thus the quantum limit is encountered at relatively easily attainable temperatures below one kelvin .    a possibility to induce nonlinearity into the mechanical potential energy",
    "was suggested in refs .  .",
    "in their setup , a mechanically induced longitudinal compression in a clamped beam would induce a double - well potential , and hence a possibility for macroscopic quantum tunneling of displacement of the beam buckling either left or right . while measurably high tunneling rates were predicted , the compression would have to be adjusted with extreme accuracy , and the crossover temperatures between thermal activation and mqt would fall in the microkelvin regime for beams longer than @xmath2 nm .    in the present work , we discuss an alternative way of inducing nonlinearity into the _ _ electro__mechanical potential at the scale of zero - point energy .",
    "we suggest to use a dc voltage to displace a conductive , clamped beam or membrane into a deflection close to the critical value where it gets pulled in to the electrode . near this pull - in voltage ,",
    "a metastable minimum appears in the electromechanical potential .",
    "the pull - in event can thus occur via a very fundamental physical process , that is , escape by quantum tunneling from a metastable state .",
    "we see that while the control of the deformation requires a high precision in the applied gate voltage , the crossover temperature becomes of the order of mk , and hence is within experimental reach .    in sec .",
    "[ meta ] we first study the behavior of the flexural mode eigenfrequency when the beam is influenced by a dc electric field from a nearby voltage gate . in sec .",
    "[ pmqt ] we calculate in detail the possibility of escaping from the metastable minimum via mqt , and consider in particular structures based on graphene , or carbon nanotubes . starting from a simplified model , we derive analytical expressions for the quantities of interest in the limits of very thin or thick beam or sheet .",
    "numerics are used to verify the results in a more general setting .",
    "we consider an electromechanical system modeled by a doubly clamped beam or sheet , having a length @xmath3 , width @xmath4 , thickness @xmath5 , density @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 .",
    "it is attached to the clamps by rigid boundary conditions .",

    "( b ) a metastable minimum in the potential energy near the pull - in point is introduced due to the nonlinearities in both electrical and mechanical energies .",
    "the system can escape from the minimum via thermal activation ( rate @xmath11 ) , or by macroscopic quantum tunneling ( rate @xmath12 ) . ]",
    "let us write the potential energy of the system . for small displacements from the un - stretched position ,",
    "the mechanical energy is quadratic with displacement . here",
    ", however , we consider large displacements nearly of the order @xmath9 , and take into account the nonlinearity due to the elongation of the beam @xcite .",
    "this affects the results substantially for thin membranes which stretch easily .",
    "we also include a built - in tension force @xmath13 which exists without the gate voltage and can be due to fabrication .",
    "in addition to the mechanical energy , the total potential energy has also an electrical contribution due to the voltage bias , given as @xmath14 v_g^2 $ ] , where @xmath15 is the capacitance between the beam and the gate .",
    "the sum of all these is @xmath16 ^ 2dy+\\frac{t_0}{2}\\int_0^l\\left[\\frac{du(y)}{dy}\\right]^2dy\\\\ & + \\frac{es}{8l}\\left(\\int_0^l\\left[\\frac{du(y)}{dy}\\right]^2dy\\right)^2+v_{{\\mathrm}{el } } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the young modulus , @xmath18 the bending moment , @xmath19 the cross section of the beam .",
    "we now write the deformation of the beam as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the amplitude and @xmath22 the mode shape of the deformation . henceforth , we consider the lowest flexural eigenmode , whose resonant frequency without the gate voltage is @xmath23 , and the mode shape is given by a combination of trigonometric and hyberbolic functions @xcite ( see eq .   for definition of @xmath24 ) .",

    "when using the approximation@xcite for the lowest flexural mode shape @xmath31 we get @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    the pull - in phenomenon can be understood as follows . the gate capacitance @xmath34 , in general , increases towards an increasing deflection @xmath35 of the membrane .",
    "this causes an attractive force @xmath36 to appear between the membrane and the gate .",
    "the effective spring constant @xmath37 thus contains a positive ( three first terms in eq .  ) and a negative part ( last term of eq .   ) .",
    "therefore it changes sign at a specific voltage @xmath38 dependent on the geometry , which corresponds to the membrane getting pulled in to contact with the gate .",

    "this approximation is relaxed in the numerical analysis , which takes into account the true shape of the deformation ( see appendix ) .",
    "apart from the thick parallel plate model ( section [ sec : thickplate ] ) , @xmath21 needs to be computed numerically from the force balance equation @xmath41 .      using the parallel plate capacitance model @xmath42 , the energy becomes @xmath43 expanding eq .",

    "the gate voltage would be reset to zero , and another gate on the opposite side could be used to pull the membrane from the van der waals attraction .",
    "a possible experimental verification is challenged by the fact that reaching a small number of states requires a high precision on the applied gate voltage , and a small change in the applied gate voltage leads to a large variation in the frequency in this regime .",
    "the wire parallel to a plate model shows that the variation close to the pull - in point is smoother than for the parallel plate model , and in this respect , carbon nanotubes seem to be good candidates for observing mqt .",
    "macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) is a fascinating topic which allows one to investigate the quantum - classical transition regime , where frequencies of collective degrees of freedom become comparable to temperature .",
    "we have introduced a model system of a mechanical degree of freedom trapped into a metastable state formed by a conductive beam or membrane suspended on a voltage biased back gate . via mqt",
    ", the fictitious particle can escape from the metastable state and thereby be pulled into contact with the gate .",
    "the setup might serve as a means of observing mechanical mqt , in a fashion analogous to how quantum behavior in josephson systems was first observed @xcite .    here",
    "we discuss the possibility of observing mqt in nanomechanical resonators for two capacitance models , those of a parallel plate capacitor , and the wire parallel to a plate , corresponding , for example , to suspended graphene or carbon nanotube .",
    "one should have the number of states in the metastable minimum close to one in order to obtain a sufficient quantum tunneling rate , and at the same time , maintain a high frequency to maximize the crossover temperature .",
    "the highest crossover temperatures are obtained in a system with low mass , low density , high young s modulus , and a high ratio @xmath135 which allows to increase the frequency by increased strain . these criteria point towards carbon - based realizations .",
    "we conclude that while the predicted crossover temperatures in the mk - range are several orders of magnitude higher than for the buckled beam studied previously , they are still experimentally demanding , and barely within reach of standard dilution refrigerator techniques .",
    "however , one may use electrical cooling techniques where the nanoresonator is coupled to higher - frequency electrical resonator in order to cool the lowest mode in question down to temperatures much lower than the environment @xcite .",

    "<S> here we investigate how to access quantum phenomena in flexural nanomechanical systems which are strongly deflected by a voltage . near a metastable point , one can achieve a significant nonlinearity in the electromechanical potential at the scale of zero point energy . the system can then escape from the metastable state via macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two model systems suspended atop a voltage gate , namely , a graphene sheet , and a carbon nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the experimental demonstration of the phenomenon is currently possible but demanding , since the mqt crossover temperatures fall in the millikelvin range . </S>",
    "<S> a carbon nanotube is suggested as the most promising system . </S>"
