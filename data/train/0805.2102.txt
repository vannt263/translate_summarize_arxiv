    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) play the important roles in astrophysics as a standard candle to measure cosmological distances as well as the production site of a large part of iron group elements .",
    "however , the nature of sn ia progenitors has not been clarified yet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been commonly agreed that the exploding star is a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( c+o wd ) and the observed features of sne ia are better explained by the chandrasekhar mass model than the sub - chandrasekhar mass model .",
    "however , there has been no clear observational indication as to how the wd mass gets close enough to the chandrasekhar mass for carbon ignition ; i.e. , whether the wd accretes h / he - rich matter from its binary companion [ single degenerate ( sd ) scenario ] or two c+o wds merge [ double degenerate ( dd ) scenario ] .",
    "it has been suggested that sne ia have a wide range of delay time from @xmath6 gyr to @xmath7 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the delay time , @xmath8 , is defined as the age at the explosion of the sn ia progenitor from its birth . according to @xcite , the present observational data of sne ia are best matched by a bimodal population of the progenitors , in which about 50 percent of sne ia explode soon after their stellar birth at the delay time of @xmath9 gyr , while the remaining 50 percent have a much wider distribution of the delay time around @xmath2 3 gyr . if the delay time distribution ( dtd ) of sne ia is observationally obtained , we are able to preclude some models that are inconsistent with the dtd .",
    "recently , the direct measurement of the dtd has been reported by @xcite .",
    "their dtd shows a featureless power law ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) between @xmath9 and @xmath10 gyr . on the basis of their results",
    ", they argued that the dtd strongly supports the dd scenario of sn ia progenitors mainly because the featureless power law distribution is in good agreement with the prediction of the dd scenario .",
    "they also concluded that the sd scenario is not well supported mainly because some `` detailed '' binary population synthesis codes predict prominent peaks in the dtd at characteristic time scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although some `` simple '' sd models with simplified treatments of binary evolution have broad dtd shapes similar to the observed dtd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the sd scenario ,",
    "the dtd is closely related to the main - sequence ( ms ) lifetime of the companion star and thus the initial mass of the companion ( secondary ) , @xmath11 .",
    "this is because the mass transfer from the companion to the wd starts when the companion evolves off the ms and expands to fill its roche lobe .",
    "the mass - accreting wd quickly grows to the chandrasekhar mass limit in @xmath12 yr ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is much shorter than the age of the binary system @xmath13 yr . the featureless power law ( @xmath0 ) of the dtd between @xmath9 and @xmath10 gyr requires a very broad mass distribution of the companion from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .    in the `` detailed '' sd models",
    ", they follow each binary evolution including many binary evolutionary processes and , as a result , the mass of the companion that can produce an sn ia is constrained to a certain range , e.g. , @xmath16 in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the delay time is also constrained to a narrow range of @xmath17 gyr , which is inconsistent with the observed dtd .    in some `` simple '' sd models , a mass range of the companion",
    "is assumed _ a priori _ to be @xmath18 simply from the condition of @xmath19 without taking into account the constraints on the mass accretion rate onto the wd and thus on the separation between the wd and the companion @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we show that the sd model with taking into account the `` detailed '' binary evolution is viable against the observed dtd . actually , the required broad distribution of the companion mass , @xmath20 has already been predicted by a recent `` detailed '' progenitor model of sne ia @xcite",
    ". however , hachisu et al . did not present any dtds mainly because at that time there were no observational data to compare with the theoretical results . here",
    "we present dtds on the basis of the new `` detailed '' sd models @xcite in   2 and 3 and compare with the observation @xcite in  4 .",
    "we start the binary evolution from the zero - age ms .",
    "unless the initial separation of the binary components is too close , the more massive ( primary with the mass of @xmath21 ) component evolves to a red giant star ( with a helium core ) or an agb star ( with a c+o core ) and fills its roche lobe .",
    "subsequent mass transfer from the primary to the secondary is rapid enough to form a common envelope .",
    "the binary separation shrinks greatly owing to the mass and angular momentum losses from the binary system during the first common envelope evolution .",
    "the hydrogen - rich envelope of the primary component is stripped away and the primary becomes a helium star or a c+o wd .",
    "the helium star further evolves to a c+o wd after a large part of helium is exhausted by core - helium - burning .",
    "thus we have a binary pair of the c+o wd and the secondary star that is an ms star ; the mass of the secondary star , @xmath22 , is still close to @xmath11 , because the accreted mass during the common envelope phase is negligibly small .    after the secondary evolves to fill its roche lobe ,",
    "the wd accretes mass from the secondary and grows to the critical mass ( @xmath23 ) and explodes as an sn ia if the initial binary orbital period ( @xmath24 ) and the initial mass of the secondary ( @xmath11 ) are inside the regions ( labeled `` initial '' ) shown in figure [ zregevl10_strip_ms_rg ] .",
    "there are two separate regions ; one is for binaries consisting of a white dwarf and a main - sequence star ( wd + ms ) and the other is binaries consisting of a white dwarf and a red giant ( wd + rg ) . here",
    "the metallicity and the initial white dwarf mass are assumed to be @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "note that the wd with @xmath26 for @xmath25 forms from the primary star of @xmath27 @xcite .    here",
    "we emphasize the effects of two important processes in the binary evolutions .",
    "the first one is the accretion wind evolution .",
    "mass - accreting wds blow strong winds when the mass transfer rate onto the wd exceeds the critical rate of @xmath28  yr@xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum taken away by this fast wind is much smaller than the orbital angular momentum , so that the separation of the binary does not shrink @xcite .",
    "if we ignore this wind effect , almost all the binaries would undergo a common envelope phase and merge ( the wd + ms systems ) or form a double degenerate system ( the wd + rg systems ) due to a large amount of angular momentum loss .",
    "none of them becomes an sn ia through the sd channel ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the second one is the mass - stripping from the secondary surface by the wd winds .",
    "this attenuates the mass transfer rate from the secondary to the wd , so that the binary can avoid the formation of a common envelope even for a rather massive secondary @xcite . in our results in figure [ zregevl10_strip_ms_rg ] , this mass - stripping effect is critically important .",
    "our results showed that the `` initial '' region of wd + ms systems extends up to such a massive ( @xmath30 ) secondary , which consists of a very young population of sne ia with such a short delay time as @xmath31  gyr . on the other hand , the wd + rg systems with a less massive rg ( @xmath32 ) consist of a very old population of sne ia of @xmath33 gyr .",
    "the birth rate of sne ia in our galaxy is expressed as @xmath34 along equation ( 1 ) of @xcite , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath21 are the mass ratio , the separation , and the primary mass in solar mass units , respectively , at the birth of a binary and @xmath37 is the sn ia region in the @xmath38-space . dividing the three - dimensional space of @xmath38 into grids of @xmath39 , we follow the binary evolution starting from the initial state of @xmath39 and obtain @xmath40 for the binaries which finally explode as sne ia . at the same time , we record the delay time of @xmath8 for each @xmath39 . in our calculation , the sn ia region of @xmath37 consists of these sn ia grid points .",
    "this procedure can easily be done when we know the `` initial '' sn ia regions for both the wd + ms and wd + rg systems as shown in figure [ zregevl10_strip_ms_rg ] .    in our previous works as seen in figure 4 of @xcite for the wd + ms system and figure 12 of @xcite for the wd + rg system , we have obtained such sn ia regions for different initial wd masses , @xmath41 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 1.0 , and @xmath42 , which formed from the primary star of masses @xmath43 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and @xmath44 at the birth , respectively , for @xmath45 @xcite . using these results ,",
    "we have estimated the sn ia birth rate in our galaxy as @xmath46  yr@xmath29 and @xmath47  yr@xmath29 , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for more detail ) .",
    "here we assume @xmath48 along @xcite .",
    "therefore , the relative ratio of the sne from the wd + ms progenitors to those from the wd + rg progenitors is @xmath49 .",
    "now we estimate the dtd of sne ia forming from the wd + ms and wd + rg systems , by integrating only the initial sets of @xmath39 having the delay time between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as @xmath52 where we adopt @xmath48 and 10 bins of the delay time at @xmath53 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.8 , 1.6 , 3.2 , 6.4 , 12.8 , and 25.6 gyr .",
    "the resultant dtd as summarized in table [ sn1a_delay_time_z02_const ] , is not normalized , thus being scale - free .",
    "we normalize our dtd by fitting the value to the observation at 11 gyr as shown in figure [ delay_time_4figures]a .",
    "our dtd shows a featureless power law ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) from 0.1 to 12 gyr , which is in good agreement with totani et al.s ( 2008 ) dtd and the data at 11 gyr by @xcite . here , we assume @xmath54  km  s@xmath29mpc@xmath29 for the hubble constant .",
    "thus the dtd on the basis of our  detailed  sd model of sn ia progenitors is consistent with the observation .",
    "it should be noticed that we plotted the number ratio of sne ia against the delay time in figure 12 of @xcite , which clearly shows a bimodality of sn ia progenitors , but the number ratio itself is not equal to the dtd of sne ia because the dtd is time - derivative of the number ratio .    here ,",
    "for instructive purposes , we derive an approximate power law of our dtd .",
    "the main - sequence lifetime of the secondary , @xmath55 , can be estimated as @xmath56 , where the mass - luminosity relation at the zero - age main - sequence is approximately written as @xmath57 with @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "the appropriate range of initial separation ( @xmath60 ) is roughly proportional to the range of orbital period , i.e. , @xmath61 , so the area of @xmath62 is calculated approximately from the sn ia region in the @xmath63 plane for a given @xmath21 like in figure [ zregevl10_strip_ms_rg ] .",
    "this area becomes narrower as the initial wd mass , @xmath64 , decreases like figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "the initial wd mass is closely related to the initial primary mass , @xmath21 , so that we numerically obtain the approximate relation of @xmath65 for the fixed @xmath21 between @xmath66 .",
    "we also numerically obtain a similar relation of @xmath67 for the fixed @xmath11 between @xmath68 .",
    "then the dtd can be approximated as @xmath69 for @xmath70 . here , we assume @xmath48 and @xmath71 .",
    "strictly speaking , the power of @xmath11 in equation ( [ m20_power ] ) is somewhere between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "if we adopt the power of @xmath73 , the final power of the delay time , @xmath8 , in equation ( [ delay_time_simple_estimate_ms ] ) changes from @xmath72 to @xmath74    for the wd + rg system , we use @xmath75 for the mass - luminosity relation of the zero - age main - sequence stars with @xmath76 and @xmath77 . applying the area of the sn ia regions that have been already calculated as shown in figure 12 of @xcite , we numerically obtain the same approximate relation as given by equation ( [ m10_power ] ) for @xmath78 and equation ( [ m20_power ] ) for @xmath79 .",
    "then we have the same power law index as in equation ( [ delay_time_simple_estimate_ms ] ) , i.e. , @xmath80 for the wd + rg channel .    in both the wd + ms and wd + rg channels , the dtd has the power law index ( @xmath0 ) close to @xmath81 regardless of the mass - lifetime dependence of @xmath71 for the wd + ms or @xmath77 for the wd + rg system .",
    "the important `` details '' to realize such dtds is how the sn ia region shrinks or expands as the initial secondary mass , @xmath11 , decreases . here",
    ", the approximate relation given by equation([m20_power ] ) holds for both the wd + ms and wd + rg systems , which leads to the logarithmic form of the dtd@xmath82 regardless of the mass - lifetime dependence , as seen in equation ( [ delay_time_simple_estimate_ms ] ) .",
    "@xcite argued that the  detailed  sd models on the basis of the population synthesis should have prominent peaks in the dtd at characteristic time scales of the secondary mass , thus being inconsistent with the observation .",
    "as already shown in figure [ delay_time_4figures]a , however , our dtd on the basis of the `` detailed '' binary evolution models has a featureless power law , being in good agreement with the observation .",
    "this is because the mass of the secondary star of the sn ia system ranges from @xmath83 to @xmath84 ( fig .",
    "[ zregevl10_strip_ms_rg ] ) due to the effects of the wd winds and the mass stripping . in our model ,",
    "moreover , the number ratio of sne ia between the wd + ms component and the wd + rg component is @xmath85 .",
    "such almost equal contributions of the two components help to yield a featureless power law as discussed below .    as for the metallicity effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assume that the metallicity had already increased to @xmath25 ( or more ) at the birth of progenitor stars mainly because the galaxies studied by @xcite consist of old galaxies , the metallicity of which had already increased to @xmath25 or more",
    ". therefore , totani et al.s ( 2008 ) data should not show any metallicity effect even if the metallicity effect really exists .    in order to see the effect of different initial distributions of the binary mass ratio @xmath86",
    ", we calculate the dtds for two cases of @xmath87 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". figure [ delay_time_4figures]b shows that the dtd for @xmath88 is in good agreement with the observation .",
    "the other dtd for @xmath89 shown in figure [ delay_time_4figures]c is marginally consistent with the observation .",
    "such a weak dependence stems from the fact that the ratio of the two sn ia components , @xmath90 , depends slightly on @xmath87 .",
    "the wd + ms component has a relatively short delay time , and tends to have a large @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast , the wd + rg component has a long delay time , having a small @xmath11 . in figure [ zregevl10_strip_ms_rg ] , for example ,",
    "@xmath27 for @xmath91 , while @xmath92 for the wd + rg system , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath86 distribution of @xmath89 has a peak at @xmath94 and takes smaller values at smaller @xmath86 . as a result , @xmath95 for this @xmath96 is slightly larger than @xmath97 for @xmath88 .",
    "thus the dtds of our `` detailed '' sd models is not so sensitive to the mass ratio distribution @xmath87 , suggesting that almost a featureless power law shape ( @xmath98 , @xmath1 ) from @xmath9 to 10 gyr is common among our `` detailed '' sd models as long as the mass range of the secondary is @xmath99 .",
    "we also calculate a dtd with a different power law index of imf , i.e. , @xmath100 instead of @xmath101 in equations ( [ realization_frequency ] ) and ( [ delay_time_distribution ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ delay_time_4figures]d , the results are hardly affected by changing @xmath102 of the imf as long as @xmath103 .",
