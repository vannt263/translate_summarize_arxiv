    "one of the intriguing questions about the cuprate superconductors - to many possibly the key to understanding superconductivity - is the role played by spin correlations in these materials . by",
    "now it is well established that the insulating parent compound of the copper oxide superconductors is well described as a two dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet in the temperature regime above the three dimensional neel ordering temperature ( @xmath2 ) . between @xmath3 and a temperature of about 600",
    "k the materials seem to follow the renormalized classical results of chakravarty , halperin and nelson @xcite . at higher temperatures",
    "the system appears to cross over to quantum scaling behavior with a dynamical exponent @xmath4 @xcite . on doping with holes , away from stoichiometry ,",
    "these insulating compounds develop into high @xmath5 superconductors even for very low hole concentration of order 5% . for such low doping the low energy hilbert space should still be dominated by spin fluctuations - as a memory effect of the undoped parent compound .",
    "the question that needs to be addressed is the peculiar interplay of short range antiferromagnetic correlations as a remnant of the ordered neel state at zero doping competing with spin singlet formation present in the superconducting state .",
    "depending on the importance attached to those two spin correlations we can distinguish two schools of thought that have strongly influenced the high @xmath5 research .",
    "the first takes the _ _",
    "s__trong antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin fluctuations seriously as providing the `` mechanism '' for superconductivity .",
    "assuming the normal state is a fermi liquid , the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations were shown to lead to a @xmath6-wave superconducting state.@xcite the spin fluctuations can be modeled phenomenologically a la millis , monien and pines @xcite in the context of a nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( nafl ) .",
    "the main degrees of freedom are spin and charge carrying quasiparticles coupled to their own spin fluctuations .",
    "the strength of the spin fluctuations is modeled by a susceptibility which is strongly peaked near the commensurate antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath7 .",
    "this strong enhancement is achieved via an rpa in the form @xmath8 as proposed by monthoux and pines ( @xmath9 is calculated by taking spin fluctuations mediated interactions between the quasiparticles into account ) . in a series of papers@xcite monthoux and pines",
    "have given what they call a `` proof of concept '' for spin - fluctuation driven pairing for the cuprates near optimal doping .",
    "they study the competition of spin - density wave ( sdw ) order with superconducting pairing by solving two - dimensional eliashberg equations for spin - fluctuation induced interactions between the quasiparticles .",
    "these approaches could account for both the d - wave pairing symmetry and the high @xmath5 s seen in the cuprates .",
    "one interesting question is of course the interplay of sdw and superconductivity as instabilities of the nafl .",
    "monthoux and pines concluded that superconductivity always prevails as the dominant instability . with the realization that the quasiparticles are not too close to a sdw instability they however needed a strong fine tuning of their stoner enhancement factor @xmath10 as a function of both momentum dependence ( strongly peaked at @xmath11 ) and strength ( @xmath12 ) to account in a `` self - consistent '' manner for their empirical input spin spectrum .    the discussion so far was centered on the optimally doped case , in this paper we shall however be concerned with the underdoped cuprates where the spin behavior shows the peculiar competition of antiferromagnetic order and singlet formation in a particularly striking way as is evidenced by various spin - pseudo - gaps seen in nmr and neutron scattering .",
    "let us briefly mention the approaches to this regime which have emphasized the antiferromagnetic order and the concomitant spin wave excitations as the dominant degrees of freedom . in an extensive study of the @xmath13 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model chubukov , sachdev and ye @xcite have identified the spin correlations in the quantum critical regime at the transition from neel order to paramagnetism . in their paper",
    "they also argue for the appearance of quantum critical scaling away from zero doping by incorporating the effect of the doped charge degrees of freedom into a reduction of the spin stiffness ( finite in the ordered neel state of the 2d heisenberg model ) sokol and pines@xcite have similarly argued for quantum critical behavior and its cross over to a quantum disordered regime driven by the frustration of antiferromagnetism via the hole motion as the physics behind the strange spin correlations in the pseudo - gap regime .",
    "they postulate a susceptibility which is dominated by the effect of a finite coherence length in the quantum disordered regime and the appearance of the corresponding _ full _ energy gap for spin excitations .",
    "as we shall argue below this phenomenology qualitatively agrees with what we obtain within the slave boson approach to the @xmath14-model , where however in contrast to the above , spin singlet formation ( or more precisely , the formation of the d - wave / staggered - flux phase  a state with a particular quantum order u1cn01n@xcite ) is the driving force behind all of the strange phenomenology in the underdoped samples .",
    "the slave boson approach is a microscopic theory for high @xmath0 superconductors which takes the on - site repulsion @xmath15 and the resulting charge gap ( @xmath16ev ) as the largest scale in the theory .",
    "it naturally reproduces the mott insulator phase at half filling and low charge carrier density at low doping .",
    "furthermore this framework allows us to calculate various line - shapes when the af - correlation is short ranged .",
    "the line - shapes can be quite different from those obtained from phenomenological models . the slave boson approach is strongly tied to the strong coupling phenomenology incorporated in the hubbard or @xmath14-model and was guided by anderson s @xcite exciting proposal of a spin liquid as a realization of the strongly correlated mott insulator in the parent compound of the high @xmath0 superconductors . more specifically , anderson proposed that the cuprate physics could be understood in terms of doping holes into a state which consists of preformed spin singlet dimers on nearest neighbor bonds whose quantum fluctuations lead to uniform strength af - correlations on all nearest neighbor bonds ( termed resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state ) .",
    "the rvb state also has short range antiferromagnetic spin correlations ( no true long range order ) due to the singlet formation and hence comprises a spin liquid phase .",
    "however , due to the success of the two dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet in describing the insulating parent compound of the cuprates this idea of a spin liquid ground state was partly rejected .",
    "nevertheless the rvb picture has a lot of appeal .",
    "let us mention briefly the rational behind the opinion that the spin singlet formation dominates antiferromagnetic correlations in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "the slave boson approach treats the underdoped cuprates as doped mott insulators - the key experimental fact of high @xmath0 superconductors .",
    "it also naturally incorporates the spin singlet formation and predicted , ahead of experiments , the pseudo - gap metallic phase@xcite in the underdoped cuprates and the superconducting d - wave order ( preferred over s - wave by strong coulomb correlations present in the mott insulator).@xcite the pseudo - gap metallic phase is a new state of matter and it is very rare in the history of condensed matter physics that a new state of matter was predicted _ before _ its experimental observation .",
    "an important effect of the preformed spin singlets , present in the rvb picture , is the fact that the spin on the doped holes can become an excitation on top of the rvb collective state whereas the charge remains tied to the empty site .",
    "this led to the notion of _ separate _ spin and charge carrying excitations called spinons and holons respectively .",
    "superconductivity then appears as a consequence of establishing coherence among the doped holes which naturally incorporates a low ( proportional to @xmath17 the hole doping concentration ) superfluid density present in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "this picture of the spin fluctuations is quite different from the nafl where ( 1 ) a metallic state with no pseudo - gap is assumed ( which does not apply to the underdoped regime ) and ( 2 ) strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations couple to spin and charge carrying quasiparticles .",
    "it is the exchange of those antiferromagnetic fluctuations which gives rise to the pairing necessary for superconductivity . however ,",
    "underdoped cuprates have a very puzzling property which seems hard to explain using the spin liquid approach ( or other approaches ) .",
    "as the doping is lowered , both the pseudo - gap and the af correlation in the normal state increase . naively , one expects the pseudo - gap and the af correlations to work against each other .",
    "that is the larger the pseudo - gap , the stronger the spin - singlet formation and the weaker the af correlations .",
    "one result coming out of the research reported here is a connection of the quantum scaling regime of the undoped compounds at high temperature with anderson s rvb picture via the algebraic spin liquid ( asl ) phase .",
    "we find that the asl can explain both the pseudo - gap and the strong af correlations in the underdoped high @xmath0 superconductors .",
    "due to the @xmath1 gauge fluctuations in the asl phase , the af spin fluctuations in the asl are as strong as those of a nested fermi surface , despite the pseudo - gap .",
    "the doped holes suppress the @xmath1 gauge fluctuations which explains the decrease of the af spin fluctuations with increasing doping even though the pseudo - gap is smaller at higher doping .",
    "we would like to stress that the asl approach to the af fluctuations is distinct from rpa - like approaches . due to the small density of states in the pseudo - gap phase",
    ", one needs to fine tune a large coupling constant within the rpa to fit the experimental data for underdoped samples .",
    "such a fine tuning is not necessary in the asl approach .",
    "thus the @xmath1 gauge structure ( and the associated spin - charge separation ) in the asl lie at the heart of the strange phenomenology of the underdoped cuprates in the so called pseudo - gap phase @xcite .",
    "the starting point of the slave boson approach is a microscopic lattice model . among the popular models , the @xmath14-@xmath18 ( _ _ g__eneralized-@xmath14 ) model seems particularly promising as a description for the low doping regime where the competition between delocalization energy @xmath19 and the spin fluctuations @xmath20 becomes manifest .",
    "@xmath21 + ... \\ ] ] the form of the @xmath14 hamiltonian can be justified starting from the hubbard model in the limit of strong on - site coulomb repulsion energy which in the cuprates leads to an insulating charge transfer gap of @xmath22 .",
    "as the coulomb energy is the largest energy scale in the problem it is natural to treat the kinetic energy as a perturbation which to lowest order in @xmath23 leads to the @xmath14 hamiltonian with the single site hilbert space restricted to the three states spin up / down and empty . for zero doping",
    "the @xmath14 hamiltonian reduces to the heisenberg model with antiferromagnetic exchange coupling ( virtual hopping on top of strong onsite coulomb repulsion naturally leads to antiferromagnetic exchange ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows ; in the next two sections ( [ asl],[susceptibility ] ) we review the ideas underlying the asl and discuss the spin correlations in this phase sketching the calculations involved ( details can be found in the appendix ) . following this",
    "we give a brief discussion on how the recently introduced concept of quantum order @xcite affects the current results ( [ aslpsg ] ) .",
    "section ( [ fate ] ) addresses the problem of what happens to the asl physics at low energies where the interactions between spinons and holons become strong .",
    "this will be followed up by a discussion of possible implications for the cuprates and a short comparison with other approaches to the same region of the phase diagram ( [ discussion ] ) .",
    "the final section ( [ conclusion ] ) will summarize the main results and discuss open problems for further study .",
    "taking the charge gap as the largest energy scale , we have argued that the natural starting point to the description of underdoped cuprates is a strongly correlated model .",
    "the question of spin correlations in the cuprates ties into the question of how to reconcile local moment magnetism with itinerant electron spin density fluctuations which is a longstanding problem in condensed matter physics",
    ". there seems to be consensus in the community on how best to describe the two extreme limits of the cuprate phase diagram - the mott insulator at zero doping as a heisenberg antiferromagnet and the heavily doped regime in terms of itinerant electron magnetism .",
    "of course as always the most interesting regime is the one lying in between the two limits which shows the antiferromagnetic - singlet dichotomy described above .",
    "for the lightly doped regime one could argue that clearly a perturbation about the neel ordered state with frustration due to holes , a la sokol and pines@xcite , makes the most sense .",
    "however , this approach does not specify the nature of the quantum spin liquid in the disordered phase .",
    "understanding the properties of the quantum spin liquid is very important since it is the quantum spin liquid that controls the pseudo - gap metallic state in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "another drawback with the nafl approach to the spin and charge fluctuations is the fact that it can not explain naturally the small charge carrier density without breaking translation symmetry .",
    "the picture of spin fluctuations followed here is the one of preformed singlets ( rvb ) which incorporates the spin correlations in the spin disordered phase ( such as the superconducting state and the pseudo - gap normal state ) in a natural way by paying the prize of throwing away a lot of antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the aim of the current paper is to show a way of reconciling the singlet formation with the strong dynamic antiferromagnetic correlations seen in nmr and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) with the help of a gauge theory based on a slave boson decoupling of the @xmath14-model .",
    "as we discussed briefly above , the ( generalized ) @xmath14-model can be shown to be an excellent description of the low energy physics embodied in the hubbard model under the condition that the single site hilbert space is constraint such that double occupation is forbidden . on an operative level this problem can be attacked by introducing slave particles that change the constraint @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the physical electron destruction operator of spin @xmath27 on site @xmath28 ) into @xmath29 where the @xmath30 is a bosonic operator - the holon - that keeps track of the empty sites and carries the charge of the physical hole , whereas the spin of the hole is carried by @xmath31 - the fermionic spinon .",
    "this is achieved by writing @xmath32 and should be read as an equality in the constraint hilbert space . with the introduction of the slave bosons",
    "we have however introduced a redundancy in the description of our physical problem which is a @xmath1 phase rotation of @xmath33 and @xmath34 that leaves the physical electron operator invariant .",
    "as the system evolves under the @xmath14 hamiltonian ( [ gtj ] ) this phase will strongly fluctuate as a function of space and time .",
    "it is this phase degree of freedom that corresponds to @xmath1 gauge fluctuations and makes the description of the constraint problem of spin + hopping in terms of fermionic and bosonic operators possible .",
    "the above program can be summarized under the name of @xmath1 slave boson theory and was implemented widely in the early days of high @xmath5 research@xcite .",
    "early on it was also realized@xcite that the heisenberg model in the fermionic representation has an extra @xmath24 invariance organizing the spinons into doublets @xmath35 in the usual @xmath1 slave boson approach this invariance was lost on introducing holes . more recently wen and lee introduced a slave boson formulation@xcite which maintains this @xmath24 structure away from half filling .",
    "this was achieved via the introduction of slave boson doublets and representing the physical electron operator as @xmath36 with @xmath37 the doublet of bosonic fields keeping track of the doped holes .",
    "the slave boson approach to the @xmath14 hamiltonian then is to use this decoupling and perform a mean - field analysis @xcite .",
    "this has led to a mean - field phase diagram as a function of hole doping @xmath17 and temperature @xmath38 which is in qualitative agreement with the phase diagram of the cuprates . within the mean - field description",
    "however the gauge freedom is treated only on the average - i.e. replaced by a static configuration of phases which in turn determine the band - structure of the spinons and holons .",
    "however as is usually the case with the identification of phases via a mean - field decoupling we need to consider fluctuations about the mean - fields to determine their stability . in particular the gauge field - unconstrained by any dynamics - will affect the physical properties in each phase drastically .    in the present paper we are concerned with the pseudo - gap regime of the cuprates which - within the @xmath1 formulation - was identified as the d - wave paired state for the spinons .",
    "within the @xmath24 approach this phase can also be described as the so called staggered - flux ( sf ) phase without explicit fermion pairing .",
    "as it turns out ( see @xcite for more details ) the @xmath24 formulation allows for a more straightforward identification of low - lying ( massless ) gauge modes and it was shown that the sf phase breaks the @xmath24 gauge structure down to @xmath1 .",
    "this massless @xmath1 mode was missed in the early discussions ( within the @xmath1 slave boson approach ) on the pseudo - gap phase and plays a crucial role in the pseudo - gap phase of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "it is responsible for the emergence of the asl . in the next section",
    "we shall discuss the physical spin correlations in the asl .    before closing this section",
    ", we would like to remark that the asl ( the sf phase ) is only one of many possible symmetric spin liquids .",
    "all symmetric spin liquids have the same symmetry , and hencewe can not distinguish different symmetric spin liquids by their symmetries .",
    "the concept of quantum order was introduced@xcite to distinguish the different internal structures present in the symmetric spin liquids .",
    "for the symmetric spin liquids constructed within the @xmath24 slave boson approach , one can use the projective symmetry group ( psg ) to characterize their different quantum orders .",
    "one finds that the sf phase is described by the particular psg with the name u1cn01n and it is one of an infinite number of possible symmetric @xmath1 spin liquids .",
    "thus the sf phase can be more accurately called u1cn01n phase . quantum order and",
    "its psg characterization is a very important concept for our discussion ( see section [ aslpsg ] ) .",
    "our starting point is the sf ( or u1cn01n ) state in the @xmath24 mean - field phase diagram where the effective degrees of freedom are spinons and holons coupled to a massless @xmath1 gauge field . in order to analyze this problem",
    "we have mapped the lattice effective theory for the sf state ( at zero doping ) onto a continuum theory of massless dirac spinors coupled to a gauge field,@xcite whose euclidean action reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , but in the following we will treat @xmath42 as an arbitrary integer . in general @xmath43 . however , for simplicity we will assume @xmath44 here .",
    "the fermi field @xmath45 is a @xmath46 spinor which describes lattice spinons with momenta near @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 @xmath49 matrices form a representation of the dirac algebra @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and are taken to be @xmath52 with @xmath53 the pauli matrices .",
    "finally note that @xmath54 .",
    "the dynamics for the @xmath1 gauge field arises solely due to the screening by bosons and fermions , both of which carry gauge charge . in the low doping limit , however , we will only include the screening by the fermion fields,@xcite which yields @xmath55 by simple power counting we can see that the above polarization makes the gauge field a marginal perturbation at the free spinon fixed point .",
    "importantly however we should note that since the conserved current ( that couples to @xmath56 ) can not have any anomalous dimension , this interaction is an _ exact _",
    "marginal perturbation protected by current conservation .",
    "let us now discuss how the gauge fluctuations affect spin correlations near momentum transfer @xmath57 .",
    "the expression for the uniform spin correlation reads ( see appendix [ appa ] ) @xmath58\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes the expectation value with respect to theory ( [ qed3a ] ) . from this expression",
    "we see that the uniform spin correlation is proportional to @xmath60 , the polarization operator of the spinons .",
    "hence it can not be strongly affected by the massless gauge field as we argued above via current conservation .",
    "this was shown in an explicit calculation by chen , fisher and wu in the context of the fqh effect @xcite .",
    "contrasting to this as was suggested by kim and lee @xcite we would expect the gauge fluctuations to strongly affect the staggered spin correlations which are not protected by current conservation and restore antiferromagnetic correlations@xcite which have been largely lost in the mean - field singlet state as we shall see next .      in the following we will present fluctuation corrections to the antiferromagnetic spin - spin correlations at order @xmath61 .",

    "the reason for this can be traced back to the spin singlet formation in the mean - field sf ( u1cn01n ) phase .",
    "this motivates the inclusion of gauge fluctuations . at order @xmath61",
    "we have the three non - vanishing diagrams depicted in fig.[[pol1n ] ] .",
    "in order to calculate the contribution of these diagrams we note that unlike the single spinon spectral function the density density correlation is gauge invariant and hence we can choose to work in the landau gauge where the gauge propagator reads @xmath71 and we have the following expressions for the diagrams shown    @xmath72 + [ \\ref{pol1n}(b ) ] = -\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d }   \\int \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d } { { \\rm tr}}\\left [ \\openone \\frac{1}{i(p+k)_{\\epsilon}\\gamma^{\\epsilon } } \\openone \\frac{1}{ik_{\\delta}\\gamma^{\\delta}}i\\gamma^\\mu d_{\\mu\\nu}(\\vec{q})\\frac{1}{i(k+q)_\\beta \\gamma^\\beta}i\\gamma^\\nu \\frac{1}{ik_\\alpha \\gamma^\\alpha } \\right ] \\ ] ]    @xmath73 = -\\frac{1}{4}\\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d }   \\int \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d } { { \\rm tr}}\\left [ \\openone \\frac{1}{i(p+k)_{\\epsilon}\\gamma^{\\epsilon}}i\\gamma^{\\mu } \\frac{1}{i(p+k+q)_{\\delta}\\gamma^{\\delta}}\\openone \\frac{1}{i(k+q)_{\\beta}\\gamma^{\\beta}}i\\gamma^{\\nu } \\frac{1}{ik_{\\alpha}\\gamma^{\\alpha}}d_{\\mu\\nu}(\\vec{q } ) \\right]\\ ] ]    after performing the trace and integrating over @xmath74 in @xmath75 , where the integrals are convergent ( see appendix [ appb ] ) , we arrive at @xmath72 + [ \\ref{pol1n}(b ) ] = \\frac{1}{n}\\int \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d } \\bigg [ \\frac{2\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{q } + \\vec{p}^2}{|\\vec{q}|^3 |\\vec{p } + \\vec{q}| } - \\frac{\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{q}}{|\\vec{p}|\\vec{q}^2|\\vec{p}+\\vec{q}| } - \\frac{|\\vec{p}|}{|\\vec{q}|^3}\\bigg]\\ ] ] @xmath76 = \\\\   \\frac{1}{n}\\int \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d}\\bigg [ \\frac{2}{\\vec{q}^2 } + \\frac{|\\vec{p}|}{|\\vec{q}|^3 } - \\frac{\\vec{p}^2 + 2\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{q}}{|\\vec{q}|^3|\\vec{p}+\\vec{q}| } -\\frac{4    \\vec{p}^4}{\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{q}\\vec{q}^2|\\vec{p}||\\vec{p}+\\vec{q}| } \\bigg ] \\ ] ]    in order to proceed we need to regularize the above integrals . because of the dot - product appearing in the denominator of the last term in ( [ pol1nc ] ) it is hard to use dimensional regularization .",
    "hence we have set @xmath75 and introduced an upper momentum cutoff @xmath77 . thus performing the final integrals over @xmath78 we can extract the @xmath79-divergent term in the form @xmath80 + [ \\ref{pol1n}(b)]+[\\ref{pol1n}(c ) ] = -\\frac{8}{12 \\pi^2 n}|\\vec{p}| ln\\bigg(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\vec{p}^2}\\bigg)\\ ] ]    after combining this with the mean - field result ( [ meanfield ] ) and continuing to real frequencies ( see appendix [ appb ] )",

    "[ chi_q_asl ]    this result is quite natural in the light of what has been said so far .",
    "the gauge fluctuations arise from the constraint of no double occupancy .",
    "the dynamics for the gauge field - in the very low doping limit assumed here - is solely due to virtual spinons .",
    "it is the low energy spinon - antispinon pairs having a nesting condition for scattering between the nodes ( separated by @xmath87 ) in the sf ( u1cn01n ) phase mean - field spectrum which are responsible for the antiferromagnetic enhancement in the asl phase .",
    "let us emphasize again that this enhancement of spin correlations at @xmath88 over the uniform component is protected , just like the gapless @xmath1 gauge fluctuations and the gapless spinons , by the u1cn01n quantum order    we have thus established algebraic behavior for the staggered spin correlations .",
    "it is such an algebraic correlation that leads to the name asl that we assigned to the phase .      for this momentum transfer the spinons get scattered between the two different types of nodes in the sf spectrum which yields the following expression for the corresponding correlations @xmath90 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    having worked hard to obtain the anomalous dimension of the staggered spin operator by brute force we will here resort to standard field theory renormalization apparatus which allows for a more economical derivation of the anomalous dimensions of composite operators . in order to obtain the anomalous dimension of the spin operator which is a fermion bilinear we need to obtain its wavefunction renormalization in the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the relevant vertex and as we have seen above depends on the momentum transfer ( @xmath93 near @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively ) .",
    "the spinon wavefunction renormalization is obtained from the self energy in the usual way and evaluates in the landau gauge to @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the renormalization scale and we have used dimensional regularization .        to obtain the vertex renormalization we need to evaluate the divergent part of the 1-loop diagram depicted in fig.[[vertex ] ] which reads @xmath98 where @xmath92 is the relevant vertex and @xmath99",
    "is given by ( [ landau_gauge ] ) .",
    "since the vertex correction diverges only logarithmically we can simply evaluate the divergent part by setting all the incoming momenta equal to @xmath100 .",
    "hence the above simplifies to @xmath101\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we now concentrate on the @xmath89 vertex .",
    "this can be easily evaluated with the help of @xmath102 and results in @xmath103 which together with equations ( [ zs ] ) and ( [ wavefunction_psi ] ) gives @xmath104 hence the spin operator at @xmath89 does nt pick up any anomalous dimension from the gauge field interactions .",
    "it is not hard to check within the above outlined calculation that for the other two vertices corresponding to the uniform and staggered spin operator , we recover the results discussed in the previous sections which gives a nice check on the brute force calculation .",
    "an important technical detail was hidden in the above calculation . in this section , we will expose this issue .",
    "the sf phase contains 2 families of 4-component massless dirac fermions , which couple to massless @xmath1 gauge fluctuations . at the perturbative level",
    ", the interaction can generate many possible counter terms ( in this case the self - energy terms ) which can + ( a ) generate a mass for the dirac fermions , + ( b ) generate a finite chemical potential for the dirac fermions and change the fermi points into fermi pockets , + ( c ) shift the crystal momenta of the dirac fermions from @xmath107 to some other values .",
    "+ in our perturbative calculation in the last section , we have assumed that non of the above counter terms are generated by the interaction .    in a generic interacting theory , we used to believe that all the counter terms that are consistent with symmetries will be generated .",
    "all of the above three types of counter terms are consistent with the underlying lattice symmetries and are hence allowed by the symmetries . in fact they do appear in our calculation of the continuum theory as cut - off dependent terms .",
    "it appears that the results in the last section are incorrect since the important counter terms are ignored .",
    "those counter terms , if present , will drastically alter our previous results .    as was stressed in this paper and in ref . and ref .",
    ", the sf phase , as a quantum spin liquid , is not only characterized by its symmetry but also by its quantum order .",
    "the quantum order in the sf phase is characterized by a particular psg ",
    "the mean - field ansatz of the sf phase is invariant under the transformations of the u1cn01n psg . as pointed out in ref . and ref .",
    ", the perturbative fluctuations around the mean - field ground state may deform the mean - field ansatz .",
    "those deformations correspond to the counter terms .",
    "however , in our case , it is incorrect to use symmetries to determine which counter terms are allowed .",
    "one should use the psg to determine the allowed counter terms .",
    "this is because perturbative fluctuations can only deform the ansatz in such a way that the deformed ansatz remains invariant under the same psg .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the above three counter terms are forbidden by the u1cn01n psg .",
    "this is why we can drop them in our calculation .",
    "when we calculate the effects of interactions in a continuum theory , we introduce a high energy / short distance cut - off .",
    "this cut - off destroys the structure of the underlying quantum order .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the counter terms forbidden by the quantum order show up in continuum theory as cut - off dependent terms . to restore the quantum order that existed in the underlying lattice theory , we can simply drop all the forbidden counter terms in our calculation within the continuum theory .",
    "we see that the psg and the concept of quantum order play an important role even in calculations within continuum theories .",
    "it is the understanding of the psg and quantum order that makes sensible calculations in the continuum limit possible .",
    "in fact , the theory of quantum order is partly motivated by the above issue of the counter terms .    in summary , the perturbative fluctuations around the mean - field sf ( u1cn01n )",
    "state can not change the quantum order and can not generate energy gaps for the @xmath1 gauge field and the spinons@xcite .",
    "thus the gapless @xmath1 gauge fluctuations and the gapless spinons are protected by the u1cn01n quantum order present in the sf ( u1cn01n ) phase .",
    "they remain gapless even when the interaction is finite all the way down to zero energy .",
    "the interacting gapless excitations lead to many unusual properties of underdoped cuprates , such as the non - fermi liquid behavior of the normal metallic state , the broad electron spectral function@xcite , and the diverging af spin fluctuations in the presence of the pseudo - gap .",
    "the u1cn01n quantum order in the sf phase not only protects the gapless excitations , it also protects the momentum of the gapless excitations .",
    "for example the spin-1 gapless excitations can only appear near @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "we would like to point out that although the asl can be a stable quantum phase in the large @xmath42 limit,@xcite for the real @xmath41 case , non - perturbative instanton effects cause an instability .",
    "thus at low energies the asl will change into some other state , such as the @xmath6-wave superconducting state , the af state , stripe states , or even a @xmath112 spin liquid state . since the u1cn01n quantum order in the sf phase requires the spin-1 gapless excitations to appear at @xmath113 , the shift of the low frequency neutron scattering peak observed in experiments @xcite indicates a transition from the asl to some other state at low temperatures .",
    "studying how the momentum of spin-1 gapless excitations shifts away from @xmath70 , @xmath89 and @xmath114 will allow us to experimentally identify the low temperature phase . in the last section ,",
    "we have studied the spin fluctuations in the asl . in the following section",
    ", we will study the spin fluctuations in the low temperature phase .",
    "in section [ susceptibility ] , we showed how the asl physics reconciles the pseudo - gap formation ( _ ie _ the condensation into spin singlets within the rvb picture ) with enhanced dynamical antiferromagnetic fluctuations . at lower energies",
    "the asl is unstable - and an important question is how the asl evolves in the underdoped regime into the superconducting state as we reduce temperature .    in the following we are going to address this question via first analyzing the effect of the opening of a gap in the gauge fluctuations on the staggered spin correlations .",
    "intuitively we should expect that for energies below the mass gap the spin correlations should be given by mean - field correlations - which is indeed the case .",
    "having established the profound effects of this gap formation we take a more careful look at the change of the mean - field correlations on going from the sf ( u1cn01n ) phase into the fermion pairing state which will allow us to address the question of incommensurate spin fluctuations seen at low frequencies and temperatures in the cuprates .",
    "let us now proceed to consider the effect of giving a mass to the gauge fluctuations . in the context of the spin correlations considered here , we would thus expect the destruction of the antiferromagnetic enhancement below the mass gap and a resurfacing of the singlet character of the correlations in the mean - field sf ( u1cn01n ) phase .    to implement",
    "the mass gap formation we take the following phenomenological form for the gauge propagator@xcite @xmath115 the calculation then goes through as above ( with one subtlety in the analytic continuation discussed in the appendix [ appb ] ) resulting in the following expression for the staggered correlation    @xmath116   c_m \\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega^2-\\mathbf{q}^2}}{m^{2\\nu } }   \\nonumber   \\\\ & + & \\theta\\left [ \\omega^2 - \\mathbf{q}^2-m^2\\right ] c_m\\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega^2-\\mathbf{q}^2}}{\\left(\\sqrt{\\omega^2-\\mathbf{q}^2 }   + \\sqrt{\\omega^2 -\\mathbf{q}^2-m^2}\\right)^{2\\nu } }   \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath117    in fig.[[chi_oq_scan ] ] we show the resulting spectra with @xmath118 .",

    "we have assumed that the only effect of the destruction of the massless @xmath1 gauge structure in the sf phase is the formation of the @xmath1 mass gap which leaves the underlying mean - field correlations in tact at low energies . on a more profound level",
    "however the massless nature of the @xmath1 gauge structure in the sf state is a manifestation of the u1cn01n quantum order@xcite present in this state ( see introduction and section [ aslpsg ] ) .",
    "thus it is not possible to simply break the gauge structure without affecting the underlying mean - field ansatz as we have assumed above .",
    "if we reverse the above logic , this implies that the low frequency spin correlations which reflect the underlying mean - field ansatz can be used as an experimental probe into the corresponding quantum order / gauge structure accompanying the mean - field correlations .",

    "it should be noted here that our asl shows qualitative similarities with the quantum critical point scenario of refs . .",
    "however as was stressed in the paper,@xcite the appearance of the pseudo - gap which they associate with the suppression of the spectral weight of spin waves characteristic of the quantum disordered ( qd ) regime should affect the low frequency dynamics for _ both _ @xmath173 and @xmath225 . within this framework it then seems hard to account for the qualitative different behaviors seen at the @xmath159 and @xmath160 sites in nmr experiments .",
    "as we have stressed many times within the asl this difference is protected by the @xmath1 gauge structure . also , in our asl approach , we do not assume , in contrast to the quantum - critical - point approach , any nearby symmetry breaking phase and we do not require any strongly fluctuating order parameters to give us critical behavior .",
    "the asl can by itself appear as a stable quantum phase , or as a phase transition point between two states with new kinds of order - quantum order",
    ". the two states can have the _ same symmetry _ and no order parameters.@xcite hence the asl associated with the transition between quantum orders can show scaling properties divorced from any critical point studied so far .    from this perspective",
    "the asl is just one of a whole slew of possible quantum orders characterized by a massless @xmath1 gauge field coupled to massless dirac fermions .",
    "it is also clear that the destruction of the asl via the transition into a phase with a massive @xmath1 gauge field ( phenomenologically described above via the introduction of the mass - scale @xmath207 ) demands a much more careful analysis and highlights the main difficulty with the slave boson approach to the @xmath14-model . within this scheme",
    "it currently seems to be impossible or at least very challenging to describe this energy / temperature regime around @xmath226 theoretically .",
    "the reason for that is related to the need of introducing a scale which is not tied to boson condensation and hence divorced from the mean - field energies and the corresponding degrees of freedom .    through our examination of the experimental data , we find that the asl , plus spin - charge recombination at lower energies , provides a consistent and natural ( with no fine tuning ) description of underdoped cuprate superconductors .",

    "the correlation near @xmath246 is obtained in a similar fashion the only difference here is that for this momentum transfer the two types of nodes get mixed and hence when we split up the sum over momentum space we need to consider all four nodes simultaneously . under this proviso",

    "<S> we propose that underdoped high @xmath0 superconductors are described by an algebraic spin liquid ( asl ) at high energies , which undergoes a spin - charge recombination transition at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> the spin correlation in the asl is calculated via its effective theory - a system of massless dirac fermions coupled to a @xmath1 gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> we find that without fine tuning any parameters the gauge interaction strongly enhances the staggered spin correlation even in the presence of a large single particle pseudo - gap . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to show that the asl plus spin - charge recombination picture can explain many highly unusual properties of underdoped high @xmath0 superconductors . </S>"
