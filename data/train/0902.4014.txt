    "transition state theory has long been and continues to be a cornerstone of the theory of chemical reaction rates @xcite . in a number of papers in recent years",
    "it has been shown that index one saddles @xcite of the potential energy surface give rise to a variety of geometrical structures in _ phase space _ , enabling the realization of wigner s vision of a transition state theory constructed in _ phase space _ @xcite .    following these studies , it is natural to investigate the phase space structure associated with saddles of index greater than one , and to elucidate their possible dynamical significance . in this note",
    "we describe the phase space structures and their influence on transport in phase space associated with _",
    "index two saddles _ of the potential energy surface for @xmath0 degree - of - freedom ( dof ) deterministic , time - independent hamiltonian systems .",
    "the phase space manifestation of an index one saddle of the potential energy surface is an equilibrium point of the associated hamilton s equations of saddle - center-@xmath1-center stability type .",
    "this means that the matrix associated with the linearization of hamilton s equations about the equilibrium point has one pair of real eigenvalues of equal magnitude , but opposite in sign ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 pairs of purely imaginary eigenvalues , @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the phase space manifestation of an index two saddle of the potential energy surface is an equilibrium point of the associated hamilton s equations of saddle - saddle - center-@xmath1-center stability type .",
    "the matrix associated with the linearization of hamilton s equations about the equilibrium point then has two pairs of real eigenvalues of equal magnitude , but opposite in sign ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 pairs of purely imaginary eigenvalues , @xmath4 , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "informally , an index two saddle on a potential surface corresponds to a maximum or `` hilltop '' in the potential @xcite .",
    "a variety of algorithms exist for determining critical points on potential surfaces @xcite",
    ". the number of higher index critical points on a potential surface must be consistent with the morse inequalities ( provided the critical points are non - degenerate ) @xcite , and this constraint is often useful in ensuring that all critical points have been located .",
    "it has however been argued that critical points of index @xmath9 and higher are of no direct chemical significance @xcite . according to the murrell - laidler theorem ,",
    "if two minima on a potential surface are connected by an index two saddle , then there must be a lower energy path between them involving only ordinary transition states ( index one saddles ) @xcite .",
    "( there are certain well - understood limitations to the murrell - laidler theorem @xcite . )",
    "it is therefore true that , provided the reaction coordinate is defined as a minimum energy path ( mep ) @xcite , it can not pass through an index two saddle on a potential surface @xcite . if however the reaction coordinate is instead associated with a gradient path ( steepest descent / ascent ) @xcite , then it is possible for an index two saddle to lie directly on the reaction path @xcite .",
    "index two saddles ( sp 2 ) were studied in some detail by heidrich and quapp @xcite , who identifed two ( extreme ) classes of sp 2 critical points . the first class , `` virtual '' saddles of index two ( v - sp 2 ) ,",
    "are associated with two essentially independent index one transition states in different parts of a large molecule , and so can be thought of simply as the direct product of two index one saddles ; an example of a v - sp 2 saddle occurs in the effectively independent internal rotation of the methyl groups in dimethyl ether @xcite . in the second class of saddles ,",
    "`` proper '' saddles of index two ( p - sp 2 ) , the motions associated with the two imaginary vibrational frequencies at the saddle ( `` downhill '' motions ) involve the same sets of atoms , and so represent inherently two dimensional dynamical processes .",
    "examples of proper index two potential saddles abound .",
    "heidrich and quapp discuss the case of face protonated aromatic compounds , where high energy saddle points of index two prevent proton transfer across the aromatic ring , so that proton shifts must occur at the ring periphery @xcite .",
    "index two saddles are found on potential surfaces located between pairs of minima and index one saddles , as in the case of internal rotation / inversion in the h@xmath10bnh@xmath10 molecule @xcite , or connected to index one saddles connecting four symmetry related minima , as for isomerization pathways in b@xmath10ch@xmath11 @xcite . in general , index two saddles are found separating symmetry related transition states in so - called `` narcissistic '' transformations @xcite .",
    "it is quite plausible that , for low enough potential barriers @xcite or at high enough energies @xcite , saddles with index @xmath12 might well play a significant role in determining system properties and dynamics .",
    "there is for example a continuing debate concerning the role of higher index saddles in determining the behavior of supercooled liquids and glasses @xcite .",
    "computations on 256 atom lj binary mixtures @xcite show that a significant fraction of saddles with index @xmath13 in high - dimensional systems are however `` virtual '' saddles in the sense of heidrich and quapp @xcite .",
    "the general relation between configuration space topology ( distribution of saddles ) and phase transitions is also of great current interest @xcite .",
    "several examples of non - mep or non - irc reactions @xcite and `` roaming '' mechanisms @xcite have been identified in recent years ; the dynamics of these reactions is not mediated by a single conventional transition state associated with an index one saddle .",
    "earnshaw s theorem @xcite suggests that higher index saddles are likely to be ubiquitous in classical models of atoms and molecules , where all particles interact via the coulomb potential .",
    "the role of index two saddles in the ( classical ) ionization dynamics of the helium atom has in fact recently been studied from a phase space perspective by haller et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "phase space structures and their influence on phase space transport were developed in some detail for the case of an index one saddle of the potential energy surface ( henceforth , `` index one saddles '' ) corresponding to an equilibrium point of saddle - center-@xmath1-center stability type for the corresponding hamilton s equations @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we follow a similar path for index two saddles .",
    "( a generalization of phase space transition state theory from index one to higher index saddles has independently been given by haller et al .",

    "the outline for this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : inverted_ho ] by discussing the phase space structure of the inverted parabolic barrier , an index one saddle .",
    "this elementary example provides the foundation for our treatment of higher index saddles . in section [ sec:3dof ]",
    "we consider geometry and transport associated with a 3 dof quadratic hamiltonian for a saddle - saddle - center .",
    "this simple model contains the essential features of the problem we are considering .",
    "the quadratic hamiltonian is separable ( and integrable ) , and we can therefore consider the saddle - saddle dynamics and center dynamics separately .",
    "the saddle - saddle dynamics is considered in detail in section [ sec : sad_sad ] where we show that the two integrals associated with the saddle - saddle dynamics serve to classify the geometry of trajectories that pass through a neighborhood of the saddle - saddle .",
    "this `` reduced dimensionality '' analysis of the saddle - saddle dynamics associated with separability of the quadratic hamiltonian is central to our analysis .",
    "we introduce a symbolic representation of the qualitatively distinct classes of trajectory behavior in the vicinity of the saddle - saddle equilibrium , and show that this symbolic representation can be placed into direct correspondence with the different classes of trajectory in the vicinity of the potential hilltop .    for completeness , and in analogy with the 3 dof case , we consider a quadratic @xmath0 dof model of a hamiltonian having an equilibrium point of saddle - saddle - center-@xmath1-center equilibrium type in appendix [ sec : ndof_quad ] , and show that separability of the quadratic hamiltonian implies that the 3 dof analysis easily goes though for the @xmath0 dof case , with obvious modifications . in section [ sec : ndof ] we consider the general case of a @xmath0 dof fully nonlinear hamiltonian having an equilibrium point of saddle - saddle - center-@xmath1-center stability type . in a neighborhood of the equilibrium point the poincar - birkhoff normal form theory can be applied to construct a set of new coordinates in which the hamiltonian assumes a simple form ( which we describe ) .",
    "in fact , for generic non - resonance conditions on the eigenvalues of the matrix associated with the linearization of hamilton s equations about the equilibrium point , the normal form hamiltonian is integrable .",
    "we show that integrability provides all of the advantages that separability provided for the quadratic hamiltonians : the saddle - saddle dynamics can be described separately and the two integrals associated with the saddle dofs can be used to characterize completely the geometry of trajectories passing through a neighborhood of the saddle - saddle - center-@xmath1-center equlibrium point .",
    "as for the case of index one saddles , normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds ( nhims ) @xcite associated with index two saddles are an important phase space structure and we describe the nature of their existence and the role they play in phase space transport in the vicinity of index two saddles in sec .  [ sec : compare ] .    in section [ sec : isomerization ]",
    "we discuss two examples where phase space structure in the vicinity of an index two saddle is potentially of importance in a problem of chemical dynamics .",
    "the first example involves isomerization on a potential energy surface with multiple ( four ) symmetry equivalent minima ; the dynamics in the vicinity of the index two saddle enables a rigorous distinction to be made between stepwise ( sequential ) and concerted ( `` hilltop crossing '' ) isomerization pathways @xcite . in the second example , two potential minima are connected by two distinct transition states associated with conventional index one saddles , and an index two saddle sits between the two index one saddles .",
    "( the transition states do not have to be symmetry equivalent @xcite . ) for high enough energies , analysis of the phase space geometry in the vicinity of the index two saddle enables different classes of reactive trajectories to be distinguished .",
    "in particular , for the case of non - equivalent index one saddles , we can rigorously define `` non - mep '' or `` roaming '' events .",
    "section [ sec : fin_top ] concludes with a discussion of some outstanding problems for future investigation .",
    "in this section we give a quantitative description of trajectories passing through a neighborhood of an equilibrium point of saddle stability type ( in brief , a `` saddle '' ) for 1 dof hamiltonian systems .",
    "while the basic material is of course well known , our discussion will illustrate the distinction between physical coordinates and normal form coordinates , show how an integral is used to distinguish qualitatively different trajectories that pass through a neighborhood of the saddle , and develop a symbolic description that describes the qualitatively distinct trajectories that pass through a neighborhood of the saddle . establishing these ideas in this simple case",
    "will allow for a straightforward generalization to more dof , beginning in section [ sec:3dof ] .",
    "we consider the problem of a 1-dimensional inverted harmonic oscillator ( negative parabolic potential ) , which in suitably scaled physical coordinates @xmath14 corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath15 with @xmath16 . in general",
    ", a hamiltonian of this form provides an approximate description of motion in the vicinity of the top of a ( generic , nondegenerate ) 1-dimensional barrier . the canonical transformation @xmath17 , where    [ ho_2 ] @xmath18    transforms the inverted harmonic oscillator hamiltonian into the normal form @xmath19 the associated equations of motion in normal form coordinates are    [ hameq_s_1 ] @xmath20    with solutions    [ hameq_s_2 ] @xmath21    the phase space origin @xmath22 is therefore an equilibrium point of saddle type .",
    "phase space portraits for the inverted harmonic oscillator in terms of the physical variables @xmath14 and the normal form variables @xmath23 are shown in figure [ fig : saddle_1 ] .",
    "we remark that the canonical ( or symplectic ) transformation to normal form coordinates , and the hamiltonian expressed in these coordinates ( known as the `` normal form hamiltonian '' ) are trivial in this 1 dof case .",
    "the real power of the normal form approach becomes clear for 2 and more dof where it is a simple matter to describe trajectories near a higher dimensional `` saddle '' and the phase space structures near the saddle can be easily described in terms of ( approximate ) integrals and the normal form coordinates ( see @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written in terms of the action variable @xmath24 which is obviously a conserved quantity ( proportional to the hamiltonian @xmath25 ) .",
    "the action @xmath26 can be positive , negative or zero .",
    "the condition @xmath27 defines 2 co - dimension one @xcite invariant manifolds ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) that intersect at the saddle equilibrium point , which is the most basic example of a nhim .",
    "more importantly , these invariant manifolds divide the phase plane into 4 regions ( quadrants ) corresponding to qualitatively different types of trajectory .    in terms of the _ physical _ variables @xmath14 , the two quadrants with @xmath30",
    "are associated with motions where the particle has enough energy to surmount the top of the parabolic barrier , so that there is no turning point in the coordinate @xmath31 ( classical barrier transmission ) , whereas the two quadrants for which the action @xmath32 are associated with motions for which the particle has insufficient energy to surmount the barrier , so that the coordinate @xmath31 exhibits a turning point ( classical reflection from barrier ) .    to obtain a more precise classification of the possible motions in the vicinity of the equilibrium point ,",
    "we define a phase space neighborhood @xmath33 of the equilibrium point as follows : @xmath34 for some suitably chosen @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "a trajectory enters @xmath33 if at some time it crosses the boundary of @xmath33 with the velocity vector pointing into @xmath33 .",
    "similarly for trajectories that exit @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to see from that , with the exception of the ( zero lebesgue measure ) set of trajectories that enter @xmath33 with @xmath36 , all trajectories that enter @xmath33 , exit @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , we can characterize the condition for entry and exit of trajectories to and from @xmath33 as follows :    condition for entry into @xmath37 : : :    @xmath38 .",
    "condition for exit from @xmath37 : : :    @xmath39 .",
    "trajectories that exit and enter @xmath33 remain in the same quadrant in the @xmath23 plane , and either pass over or are reflected by the potential barrier ( this latter interpretation is based on the hamiltonian expressed in terms of the physical coordinates ) .",
    "corresponding to the four distinct quadrants , we define four classes of trajectory :    * @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) * @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , @xmath42 ) * @xmath45 ( @xmath41 , @xmath46 ) * @xmath47 ( @xmath44 , @xmath46 )    this description uses both the physical and normal form coordinates , and the notation indicates the net result of passage through region @xmath33 in terms of the action of an associated `` scattering map '' .",
    "considering the first item , reading from right to left @xcite , @xmath48 refers to a trajectory in the physical coordinates that enters the neighborhood of the saddle with @xmath49 and exits the neighborhood of the saddle with @xmath49 , i.e. it is reflected from the barrier on the @xmath49 side . in the normal form",
    "coordinates this trajectory corresponds to a trajectory in the fourth quadrant , ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "similarly , trajectories of type @xmath43 enter a neighborhood of the saddle with @xmath50 , pass over the saddle , and exit the neighborhood of the saddle with @xmath51 . in normal form",
    "coordinates these correspond to trajectories in the third quadrant , ( @xmath44 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "the remaining two cases are understood similarly .",
    "in this section we describe the nature of trajectories as they pass through a neighborhood of an index 2 saddle for a 3 dof quadratic hamiltonian",
    ". we will express the hamiltonian in normal form coordinates .",
    "however , the symbolic representation of the trajectories will be based on dynamics described in terms of the physical coordinates , as in the previous section .",
    "we now consider a 3 dof quadratic hamiltonian that describes the dynamics near a saddle - saddle - center stability type equilibrium point located at the origin : @xmath52 note that the variables @xmath53 in hamiltonian are not physical coordinates , but rather normal form coordinates as defined in eq .  .",
    "the hamiltonian can be used to describe dynamics in the vicinity of a hill - top ( nondegenerate index two saddle ) in a 3 dimensional potential energy surface .",
    "hamiltonian is completely integrable , with ( independent ) integrals : @xmath54 and can be expressed as a function of the integrals : @xmath55 these integrals play a crucial role in our understanding of the underlying phase space geometry and transport .",
    "an important consequence of the separability of the 3 dof quadratic hamiltonian is that an understanding of the nature of the trajectories passing through a neighborhood of the saddle - saddle - center equilibrium point can be obtained through a study of the 2 dof subsystem corresponding to the saddle - saddle , since motion in the center dof is bounded , and the action @xmath56 is conserved .",
    "the hamiltonian for this 2 dof subsystem is : @xmath57 with integrals @xmath26 and @xmath58 as given in .",
    "hamilton s equations for the 2 dof saddle - saddle subsystem are given by :    [ hameq_ss_1 ] @xmath59    the phase flow in the vicinity of the saddle - saddle equilibrium is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : saddle_saddle ] . in this figure",
    "we show the phase flow in both the physical coordinates defined in and the normal form coordinates . the transformation between these two sets of coordinates is given in .",
    "since our hamiltonian is separable , it is a trivial matter to use this coordinate transformation on both saddles to express the hamiltonian in physical coordinates .",
    "however , the separability also means that we can immediately adapt the discussion of the previous section for physical coordinates to the saddle - saddle case , and it is this approach that we will follow .",
    "as before , we define a neighborhood @xmath33 of the equilibrium point in phase space as follows : @xmath60 for some suitably chosen @xmath35 and @xmath61 @xcite . as for the 1 dof case , with the exception of the ( zero lebesgue measure ) set of trajectories that enter @xmath37 with @xmath62 , all trajectories that enter @xmath37 , exit @xmath37 .",
    "we characterize the condition for entry and exit of trajectories to and from @xmath37 as follows :    condition for entry into @xmath37 : : :    @xmath63 .",
    "condition for exit from @xmath37 : : :    @xmath64 .",
    "as for the 1 dof unstable equilibrium , we can define different classes of trajectory characterized by their behavior under the scattering map corresponding to passage through the region @xmath33 .",
    "for the 2 dof case , there are @xmath65 combinations of quadrants , and @xmath66 types of trajectory .",
    "the symbolic description of the behavior of a trajectory as it passes through a neighborhood of the saddle - saddle with respect to the physical coordinates @xmath67 , is expressed by the following four symbols , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 . here",
    "@xmath73 refer to the `` initial '' sign of @xmath74 as it enters the neighborhood of the saddle - saddle and @xmath75 refer to the `` final '' sign of @xmath74 , as it leaves the neighborhood of the saddle .",
    "for example , trajectories of class @xmath76 pass over the barrier from @xmath49 to @xmath77 , but remain on the side of the barrier with @xmath78 .",
    "of the 16 qualitatively distinct classes of trajectory , the 4 types @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the only trajectories that undergo a change of sign of both coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath83 , and so they are the trajectories that pass `` over the hilltop '' in the vicinity of the saddle - saddle equilibrium .    as in the 1 dof case ,",
    "co - dimension one surfaces separate the different types of trajectory .",
    "these are the four co - dimension one invariant manifolds given by @xmath84 ( i.e. @xmath85 ) .",
    "for example , the co - dimension one surface @xmath86 forms the boundary between trajectories of type @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and so on .",
    "the dynamical significance of this symbolic classification is disussed in section [ sec : isomerization ] in the context of isomerization reactions .      because the system is separable , including the additional center dof has no effect on our discussion above on the nature of trajectories in the 2 dof saddle - saddle subsystem as they pass through a neighborhood of the saddle .    to see this , note that equations of motion for hamiltonian are given by :    [ hameq_ss ] @xmath89    as previously",
    ", we define a neighborhood of the saddle - saddle - center equilibrium point in phase space as follows : @xmath90 for suitably chosen @xmath35 , @xmath61 and @xmath91 .",
    "we want to describe the geometry associated with trajectories that enter and leave @xmath37 .",
    "first , note again the fact that hamilton s equations are separable , and that the ( simple harmonic ) motion of @xmath92 and @xmath93 is bounded .",
    "it then follows that if @xmath92 and @xmath93 are initially chosen to satisfy the condition for being in @xmath37 , then they satisfy this condition for all time .",
    "hence , the issue of trajectories entering @xmath37 and exiting @xmath37 depends entirely on the behavior of the @xmath53 components of a trajectory and , as a consequence of separability , this behavior is exactly as described in section [ sec : sad_sad ] .",
    "we now examine some further aspects of the geometry for the 3 dof quadratic hamiltonian model of a saddle - saddle - center .",
    "the equilibrium point is located at the origin and has zero energy .",
    "we consider geometric structures in the energy surface for positive energies : @xmath94 it is clear from that @xmath95 is a two dimensional invariant manifold in the 6 dimensional phase space .",
    "using , its intersection with the 5 dimensional energy surface is given by : @xmath96 this is a periodic orbit in the energy surface but , more generally , it is an example of a nhim .",
    "the coordinates @xmath97 can be viewed as coordinates for the normal directions of the nhim , and it follows from the nature of the asymptotic ( in time ) behavior of these coordinates ( see ) that this nhim has a 3 dimensional stable manifold and a 3 dimensional unstable manifold in the 5 dimensional energy surface .",
    "further discussion of the role of nhims is given in section [ sec : nhim ] .",
    "the examples we have considered so far have been exceptional ",
    "quadratic , separable  hamiltonians ( which implies that they are completely integrable ) .",
    "now we will show that for a general time - independent hamiltonian , in a neighborhood of an equilibrium point of saddle - saddle - center-@xmath1-center stability type , a `` good set of coordinates '' can be found in terms of which the hamiltonian assumes a simple form for which the results described above hold .",
    "moreover , these coordinates are obtained via a constructive algorithm .    for completeness , in appendix [ sec : ndof_quad ]",
    "we consider in detail the nature of trajectories associated with a quadratic @xmath0 dof hamiltonian model that describes the dynamics near a saddle - saddle - center-@xmath1-center stability type equilibrium point , and then we consider the case where higher order terms are included in this model .",
    "specifically , in a neighborhood of an equilibrium point of saddle - saddle - center-@xmath1-center stability type , poincar - birkhoff normal form theory can be used to ( formally ) construct a symplectic change of coordinates so that in the new coordinates the hamiltonian has the form : @xmath98 where @xmath99 assumes a particularly simple form that is amenable to analysis .",
    "this is discussed in some detail , with particular relevance to reaction dynamics , in ref .",
    "@xcite . for our purposes , if we assume that the purely imaginary eigenvalues satisfy the non - resonance condition @xmath100 for any @xmath7 vector of integers @xmath101 with _ not all _ the @xmath102 ( that is , @xmath103 ) and the real eigenvalues satisfy the ( independent ) non - resonance condition @xmath104 for any @xmath9 vector of integers @xmath105 with _ not all _ the @xmath102 , @xmath106 , then @xmath99 can be represented as an even order polynomial in the variables @xmath107    in other words , we can express the normal form hamiltonian in this situation as @xcite : @xmath108 with the associated hamilton s equations given by :    [ nf_hameq ] @xmath109    and it can be verified by a direct calculation that the @xmath110 , @xmath111 are integrals of the motion for @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath110 , @xmath111 are constant on trajectories , it follows that the partial derivatives @xmath112 are also constant on trajectories .",
    "hence , it follows that the structure of eqs is extremely simple , and this is a consequence of the integrability of the normal form .",
    "we can define a neighborhood of the equilibrium point exactly as in eq .   in appendix",
    "[ sec : ndof_quad ] and consider the geometry associated with trajectories that enter and leave @xmath113 .",
    "even though the nonlinear hamilton s equations are _ not _ separable , it follows from integrability and the structure of that the motion of @xmath114 and @xmath115 is bounded , @xmath116 ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 just undergo periodic motion , individually for each @xmath117 , although the frequency of motion can vary from trajectory to trajectory ) .",
    "it then follows that if @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath118 , are initially chosen in @xmath113 , then they remain in @xmath113 for all time .",
    "hence , exactly as in the quadratic case , the issue of trajectories entering @xmath113 and exiting @xmath113 depends entirely on the behavior of the @xmath53 components of a trajectory and , as a consequence of integrability , this behavior is exactly as described in section [ sec : sad_sad ] and we have the integrals @xmath26 and @xmath58 as parameters for describing the geometry of the trajectories during their passage though @xmath113 .",

    "an important property of nhims is that they , as well as their stable and unstable manifolds , persist under perturbation .",
    "if we consider a small @xmath113 , then the terms @xmath124 can be considered as a perturbation of the quadratic hamiltonian , for which the nhim had the geometrical structure of @xmath125 .",
    "if the perturbation is `` sufficiently small '' then this spherical structure is preserved .",
    "the normalization proceeds via formal power series manipulations whose input is a taylor expansion of the original hamiltonian , @xmath126 , necessarily up to some finite order , @xmath127 , in homogeneous polynomials . for a particular application ,",
    "this procedure naturally necessitates a suitable choice of the order , @xmath127 , for the normalization , after which one must make a restriction to some local region , @xmath113 , about the equilibrium point in which the resulting computations achieve some desired accuracy .",
    "hence , the accuracy of the normal form as a power series expansion truncated at order @xmath127 in a neighborhood @xmath113 is determined by comparing the dynamics associated with the normal form with the dynamics of the original system .",
    "there are several independent tests that can be carried out to verify accuracy of the normal form .",
    "straightforward tests that we have used are the following @xcite :    * examine how the integrals associated with the normal form change on trajectories of the full hamiltonian ( the integrals will be constant on trajectories of the normal form ) .",
    "* check invariance of the different invariant manifolds ( i.e. the nhim and its stable and unstable manifolds ) with respect to trajectories of the full hamiltonian .    both of these tests require us to use the transformations between the original coordinates and the normal form coordinates .",
    "specific examples where @xmath127 , @xmath113 and accuracy of the normal forms and the constancy of integrals of the truncated normal form are considered can be found in @xcite .",
    "a general discussion of accuracy of the normal form can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss a number of issues that arise from the above results and discussions . for comparative purposes",
    "it is helpful first to summarize the nature of trajectories that pass near an index one saddle and trajectories that pass near an index two saddle .      for index one",
    "saddles it was shown in previous work that for energies above that of the saddle - center-@xmath1-center there exists a @xmath123 dimensional normally hyperbolic invariant manifold ( nhim ) in the @xmath121 dimensional energy surface @xcite .",
    "the nhim is of saddle stability type and has @xmath128 dimensional stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "since these are one less dimension than the energy surface , they act as higher dimensional separatrices and serve to partition phase space into regions corresponding to qualitatively different types of trajectories :    * forward reactive trajectories @xmath129 * forward non - reactive trajectories @xmath130 * backward reactive trajectories @xmath131 * backward non - reactive trajectories @xmath132    where we have indicated the correspondence with the trajectory classification introduced in sec.[sec : inverted_ho ] .",

    "forward reacting trajectories pass through one hemisphere and backward reacting trajectories pass through the other hemisphere .",
    "these `` dividing hemispheres '' have the _ no - recrossing property _ in the sense that the vector field defined by hamilton s equations is strictly transverse to each hemisphere .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the flux is minimal ( and equal ) for each hemisphere .",
    "the language used for the description of trajectories for the case of an index one saddle is that of reaction .",
    "trajectories evolve from reactants to products by passing through a dividing surface that locally `` divides '' the energy surface into two disjoint pieces  reactants and products .    here",
    ", we have classified trajectories in the vicinity of an index one saddle in a slightly less general but more explicit fashion in terms of their behavior with respect to crossing a potential barrier ; this classification is useful in the treatment of reactive dynamics in the vicinity of higher index saddles on potential energy surfaces , as discussed below .",
    "the geometrical structures associated with index one saddles provide a rigorous way of partitioning the phase space into regions that describe the evolution of a system from reactants to products by passing through a dividing surface having the no - recrossing and minimal flux properties .",
    "this partitioning is made possible by the existence of invariant manifolds that have the proper dimension and stability type .",
    "moreover , their geometric character is such that the partitioning that they provide has the natural interpretation of regions of reactants and products of the energy surface , and the stable and unstable manifolds of the nhim provide natural boundaries between these regions",
    ".    for index two saddles the same types of invariant manifolds still exist  a nhim and co - dimension one ( in the energy surface ) invariant manifolds .",
    "these co - dimension one invariant manifolds ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath106 ) were introduced above and are discussed further below .",
    "it was shown that the passage of trajectories through the neighborhood of the equilibrium could be understood in terms of a 2 dof saddle - saddle subsystem and values of the two associated action integrals .",
    "for index one saddles not all trajectories could pass through the dividing surface ( by definition , the forward and backward non - reactive trajectories do not do so ) .",
    "however , for index two saddles all trajectories ( except for the set of lebesgue measure zero discussed above ) that enter the neighborhood of the equilibrium point exit the neighborhood of the equilibrium point , and there are sixteen qualitatively different types of trajectory that enter and exit this neighborhood .",
    "these sixteen classes are characterized by their crossing behavior with respect to the `` hilltop '' in the potential surface associated with the index two saddle .",
    "two examples involving isomerization reactions where this classification of trajectories is of chemical relevance are discussed in section [ sec : isomerization ] .",
    "it has been previously been argued @xcite that the invariant manifold structure associated with index one saddles is a natural generalization to 3 or more dof of the pods , and their associated invariant manifolds , where the latter have provided a fundamental understanding of transition state theory for systems with 2 dof @xcite . the necessary ingredient to make the leap from 2 dof to higher",
    "dof is the realization that a nhim of saddle stability type is the natural generalization to higher dof of the periodic orbit of saddle stability type familiar from 2 dof @xcite .",
    "the resulting geometric picture of reaction for @xmath135 dof is essentially that of the 2 dof case , the key feature of the generalization being the availablity of the necessary invariant manifolds to partition the energy surface in the multidimensional case in a manner that is meaningful for reaction .",
    "the situation with index two saddles is fundamentally different . on energy surfaces above that of the saddle , a nhim still exists , but it is co - dimension 4 in the energy surface with co - dimension 2 stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "nevertheless , as shown above , it is still possible to construct co - dimension one invariant manifolds ( in the energy surface ) that locally partition the energy surface into regions associated with qualitatively different types of trajectory passing through a neighborhood of the equilibrium point : the surfaces defined by the conditions @xmath136 , @xmath137 @xmath138 , and @xmath139 are each co - dimension one invariant manifolds in the @xmath120 dimensional phase space , and they are also co - dimension one invariant manifolds when intersected with the energy surface .",
    "they do not have the property of being compact and boundaryless like the nhims we have discussed above .",
    "we would not expect this since ( almost ) all trajectories that enter @xmath113 leave @xmath113 .",
    "these co - dimension one invariant manifolds intersect the boundary of @xmath113 , and their projection into the @xmath140 space gives the coordinate axes shown in fig [ fig : saddle_saddle ] .",
    "this is consistent with our description of trajectories that enter and exit @xmath113 through the use of the integrals @xmath26 and @xmath58 .",
    "while the existence of co - dimension one invariant manifolds in phase space associated with index one or index two saddles is conceptually appealing , practically , their main use derives from the integrable structure of the normal form and the expression of hamilton s equation using this integrability ( e.g. ) .",
    "this expression allows for a decoupling of the dynamics into unbounded motion ( the `` reactive modes '' described by @xmath26 and @xmath58 ) and bounded motion ( the `` bath modes '' described by @xmath141 ) .",
    "the `` reactive dynamics '' is described by a reduced dimensional system and the dynamics in this system is integrable and characterized by the level sets of these integrals .",
    "the relevant co - dimension one invariant manifolds drop out of this description naturally .    in the earlier work related to index",
    "one saddles in @xcite the integrable structure was not emphasized and the uses of the integrals was not developed . rather , the emphasis was on the use of the normal form in discovering the phase space structures .",
    "it was hoped that a by - product of the normal form computations might be useful and intuitive visualization methods of the kind that have proved extremely useful and insightful for 2 dof systems .",
    "however , visualization schemes for the invariant manifolds governing reaction in systems with three and more dof have thus far been of limited value . in @xcite attempts",
    "were made to visualize the phase space invariant manifolds governing ( planar ) hcn isomerization in three dimensions by projecting the manifolds into the three dimensional configuration space . in this case , the dividing surface ( in a fixed energy surface ) was four dimensional with its equator , the nhim , three dimensional .",
    "it was difficult to interpret their projections into the three dimensional configuration space ( visually , they did not appear significantly different ) .",
    "moreover , reversibility of hamilton s equations in this case implies that the projections of the four dimensional stable and unstable manifolds into configuration space are identical . while the visualization of high dimensional phase space structures is an appealing concept , we believe that the dimensional reduction afforded by integrability of the normal form in a neighborhood of the equilibrium point is a much more powerful tool for understanding reactive phenomena .",
    "it provides a precise notion of dimensional reduction to the number of dofs undergoing `` reactive behaviour '' ( i.e. the dof for which there is the possibility of leaving a neighborhood of the equilibrium point ) .",
    "the significance of integrability was emphasized in @xcite where it was also shown how the phase space structures can be expressed in terms of the integrals ( which is what we have essentially done here ) . while their utility for higher dimensional visualization remains to be demonstrated , for index one saddles the dividing surface plays an important role for a certain types of sampling @xcite and the nhim plays a role in determining the flux through the dividing surface .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in section [ sec : fin_top ] .",
    "once the generalization from index one to index two saddles has been made , generalization to higher index saddles is straightforward . for an @xmath0 dof deterministic , time - independent hamiltonian system ,",
    "an index @xmath117 saddle ( @xmath142 ) of the potential energy surface corresponds to an equilibrium point of hamilton s equations where the matrix associated with the linearization of hamilton s equations about the equilibrium point has @xmath117 pairs of real eigenvalues and @xmath143 pure imaginary pairs of eigenvalues . assuming that appropriate generic non - resonance assumptions on the real and imaginary eigenvalues hold , then a transformation to an integrable poincar - birkhoff normal form in a neighborhood of the equilibrium point as described above can be carried out . for energies above the equilibrium point , the system has @xmath117 integrals describing `` reactive '' dynamics ( i.e. , trajectories that can enter and leave a neighborhood of the equilibrium point ) and @xmath143 integrals describing `` bath modes '' ( i.e. , bounded motions in a neighborhood of the equilibrium point ) .",
    "hence integrability allows the reactive dynamics to be studied with a @xmath144 dimensional reduced system with the @xmath117 reactive integrals providing precise information about the nature of trajectories that pass through a neighborhood of the equilibrium point .",
    "moreover , for energies above the saddle , the system has a nhim of dimension @xmath145 having @xmath146 dimensional stable and unstable unstable manifolds in the @xmath121 dimensional energy surface . in the neighborhood of the equilibrium point , there are @xmath147 qualitatively distinct trajectory classes .      applying the formalism for higher index saddles to realistic molecular systems requires software that computes the normal form hamiltonian , extracts the integrals of the motion , and computes the coordinate transformation ( and its inverse ) from the original physical coordinates to the normal form coordinates ,",
    "all to sufficiently high order to yield the desired accuracy ( and accuracy must be assessed by a battery of tests at all points of the calculation ) .",
    "software to carry out this program for index one saddles is available at http://lacms.maths.bris.ac.uk/publications/software/index.html . in principle",
    "it is possible to modify this software to carry out the analysis described above for index two , and higher , saddles .",
    "a number of possible contexts in which index two saddles might be important have already been discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "it is however useful to specify the possible dynamical role of index two saddles more precisely .",
    "we consider two examples : first , the dynamical definition of stepwise ( sequential ) versus concerted isomerization mechanisms on a multi - well potential surface ; second , the classification of reactive trajectories in a system in which there are two distinct transition states . in the latter case",
    "our analysis of dynamics in the vicinity of the index two saddle suggests a rigorous identification of so - called `` non - mep '' @xcite or `` roaming '' trajectories @xcite based on phase space structures .",
    "it should be noted that the partitioning of phase space we discuss is local , that is , restricted to the vicinity of the index two saddle .",
    "index two saddles are of dynamical significance in the identification of sequential versus concerted isomerization mechanisms in the case of multiple well isomerizations .",
    "consider a system with two coordinates @xmath148 , having a multiwell potential surface @xmath149 of the kind shown schematically in figure [ plot_4_well ] @xcite .",
    "such a surface can describe , for example , conformational energies as a function of internal angles @xcite or internal rotation / inversion potentials @xcite .",
    "( see , for example , figure 1 in ref .  .",
    ")    the model potential shown has 4 minima .",
    "each potential minimum is given a symbolic label according to the quadrant of the @xmath148 plane in which it is located .",

    "the minima are connected by index one saddles , each denoted by the symbol @xmath151 . at higher energy , in the middle of the potential surface , sits an index two saddle , denoted @xmath152 ( the `` hilltop '' ) .",
    "( we locate the index two saddle at the coordinate origin , @xmath153 , and take the value of the potential at the hilltop to be zero , @xmath154 . )    for total energies @xmath155 , the system can only make transitions between minima by passing through the phase space dividing surfaces ( transition states ) associated with the index one saddles ( nhims ) . for such energies , we can define the distinct bound ( reactant ) regions of phase space in the usual way , and describe the isomerization kinetics in terms of the associated phase space volumes and flux through phase space dividing surfaces associated with the index one saddles .",
    "classes of isomerizing trajectories associated with particular transitions between wells can be denoted symbolically : for example , trajectories of type @xmath156 start in the well @xmath47 and pass to the well @xmath43 through the appropriate dividing surface .",
    "it is clear that , for @xmath155 , the only way the system can pass from well @xmath47 to well @xmath40 , say , is by a _",
    "stepwise _ mechanism : a sequence of isomerizations such as @xmath157 followed by @xmath158 is required .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath159 , trajectories are in principle able to `` roam '' around on the potential surface .",
    "in addition to the sequential mechanism just described , there is another possibility , namely , a hilltop crossing or _",
    "concerted _ mechanism , where , for the example just discussed , a trajectory simply passes `` directly '' from well @xmath47 to well @xmath40 without undergoing the stepwise isomerization process which is necessary for @xmath155 .",
    "it is then natural to ask : how can we distinguish between these mechanisms in a dynamically rigorous way ?",
    "it is not sufficient to analyze trajectories in configuration space , as both sequentially isomerizing and hilltop crossing trajectories will pass close to the index two saddle .",
    "the key to dynamical analysis of isomerizing trajectories is the symbolic trajectory classification introduced previously .",
    "we imagine that the saddle - saddle normal form has been obtained in the vicinity of the index two saddle .",
    "this means , in particular , that a ( nonlinear , in general ) invertible symplectic transformation @xmath160 has been obtained relating physical coordinates @xmath161 and normal form coordinates @xmath53 @xcite @xmath162 in a phase space neighborhood of the saddle - saddle equilibrium , it is therefore possible to use the inverse transformation @xmath163 to determine the normal form coordinates along a given trajectory .",
    "given these normal form coordinates and the approximate integrability of the motion in the vicinity of the index two saddle , a trajectory with energy @xmath159 can be classified according to the symbolic scheme developed previously .",
    "for the particular kind of potential surface considered here , the symbolic classification scheme of trajectories using the normal form is precisely the desired classification scheme for isomerization behavior .",
    "for example , a trajectory of type @xmath157 passes from well @xmath47 to well @xmath45 , and so is part of a sequential isomerization process , while a trajectory of type @xmath79 is a hilltop crossing trajectory that , as determined by a rigorous phase space criterion in the vicinity of the saddle - saddle equilibrium , passes directly from well @xmath47 to well @xmath40 .      we now introduce a third mode : for simplicity , we first consider an uncoupled harmonic oscillator dof . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sad_sad_cent ] , there is now a saddle - saddle - center equilibrium . for given total energy @xmath164",
    ", there will be distinct regimes , depending on the partitioning of energy between mode 3 and the 2 dof isomerizing subsystem .    if the total energy @xmath164 is above that of the index two saddle , but there is sufficient energy in mode 3 , then hilltop crossing isomerization is not possible in the 2 dof subsystem .",
    "if on the other hand the amount of energy in mode 3 is small , then the 2 dof subsystem can undergo both sequential and hilltop crossing isomerization .",
    "isomerizing trajectories in the 3 dof system can then be classified using the normal form including the center dof as developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sad_sad_cent ] .",
    "suppose that mode 3 and the 2 dof subsystem are now coupled .",
    "if we consider the behavior of trajectories initialized in a region of phase space with a large amount of energy in mode 3 a relevant question is : what is the mechanism by which the system will pass from one potential minimum to another , given that the minima in question are separated by more than one saddle at low energies ?    intuitively , there are two possibilities : if significant energy transfer between mode 3 and the 2 dof subsystem does not occur , then the system simply passes from one well to the other in a sequential fashion .",
    "if however energy transfer occurs between mode 3 and the 2 dof isomerizing subsystem , it is possible that sufficient energy can pass into the 2 dof subsystem so that trajectories can isomerize via the hilltop crossing mechanism . in this case ,",
    "hilltop isomerization is mediated by the additional mode .",
    "these dynamical alternatives can in principle be distinguished using the transformation to normal form coordinates in the vicinity of the saddle - saddle - center equilibrium ( cf .",
    "[ sec : sad_sad_cent ] ) .",
    "we now discuss a second example where analysis of the phase space structure in the vicinity of an index two saddle is potentially useful for obtaining deeper mechanistic understanding of an isomerization reaction .",
    "consider the model 2 dof potential shown in figure [ plot_2_well ] .",
    "this potential has two minima , two index one saddles ( having different energies ) and one index two saddle ( energy @xmath165 ) .",
    "the index two saddle sits between the two index one saddles ( as per murrell - laidler @xcite ) .",
    "( see , for example , the double proton transfer reaction in napthazarin , scheme 14 in ref .  .",
    ")    at total energies @xmath155 , the system can pass from one well to another through either of two transition states ; in the example shown , the transition state associated with the index one saddle at @xmath78 has lower energy , and hence is associated with the `` minimum energy path '' mechanism .    at energies above that of the higher energy ts ( denoted channel 2 ) , there may exist some kind of dynamical competition between transition states : the lower energy ts ( channel 1 ) might be narrow ( small flux ) , while the higher energy ts ( channel 2 ) might be broader ( larger flux ) .    for energies above the hilltop , @xmath159 , there are in principle three possibilities : trajectories can isomerize via channel 1 , via channel 2 , or they can isomerize by `` passsage over the hilltop '' .",
    "once again , the symbolic classification of trajectories in the vicinity of the saddle - saddle equilibrium enables the three classes of trajectory to be rigorously identified .",
    "trajectories of class @xmath157 correspond to the first mechanism ( channel 1 ) , class @xmath166 the second mechanism ( channel 2 ) , while trajectories of class @xmath81 or @xmath79 are associated with the hilltop crossing isomerization .",
    "all isomerizing trajectories except those of class @xmath157 can therefore be labelled `` non - mep '' trajectories @xcite .",
    "all such non - mep trajectories can be regarded as `` roaming '' trajectories @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the phase space structure in the vicinity of an equilibrium point associated with an index two saddle or `` hilltop '' on a potential energy surface ( `` index two saddle '' ) .",
    "for the case of model quadratic hamiltonians we have shown that the behavior of trajectories passing through a phase space neighborhood of the equilibrium is fully characterized by the value of associated integrals of the motion .",
    "we have introduced a symbolic classification of trajectories in the vicinity of the saddle - saddle equilibrium , where the symbolic representation of trajectory classes is directly related to the nature of the associated hilltop crossing dynamics . for the general case where nonlinear terms are present in the hamiltonian ,",
    "poincar - birkhoff normal form theory provides a constructive procedure for obtaining an integrable approximation to the full hamiltonian in the vicinity of the equilibrium , allowing a corresponding classification of trajectories to be made in the general case .    as for the case of index one",
    "saddles , normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds ( nhims ) associated with index two saddles are an important phase space structure , and we have described the role they play in phase space transport in the vicinity of index two saddles . in particular , we have shown that the normal form transformation enables co - dimension one surfaces to be defined in phase space ; these surfaces serve to partition phase space in the vicinity of the saddle - saddle equilibrium into regions corresponding to distinct trajectory types .",

    "we suggest that classification of different classes of reactive trajectories in the vicinity of the index two saddle enables a rigorous definition of non - mep trajectories to be given in terms of local phase space structure .",
    "to conclude , we list several topics that we believe merit further investigation for the case of index two saddles .",
    "reaction coordinates . : :    for the case of index one saddles a natural definition of a phase    space reaction coordinate is obtained by putting all of the energy    into the reactive mode @xcite , i.e. , for energy    @xmath167 , and the hamiltonian expressed as a function of the    integrals , we set @xmath168 this    condition defines a path in the `` reactive plane '' defined by    @xmath169 and @xmath170 in normal form coordinates ,    which can then be mapped back into the original physical coordinates    by the normal form transformation .",
    "+    for the case of an index two saddle we have two reactive modes ,    described by the integrals @xmath26 and @xmath58 ,    and a four dimensional `` reactive space '' defined by the coordinates    @xmath140 .",

    "+    for energies @xmath159 , do conditions    @xmath171    define dynamically significant paths in the reactive space ?",
    "an    analogous question can be posed for index @xmath117 saddles ,    @xmath172 .",

    ": :    for the case of index one saddles the nhim is the `` boundary '' of the    forward and backward dividing surfaces .",
    "the magnitudes of the fluxes    across each of these dividing surfaces are equal and , using stokes    theorem , are expressed as the integral of an appropriate quantity over    the nhim , equal to the volume in the space of `` bath modes '' enclosed    by the contour defined by @xmath174    @xcite .",
    "+    for index two ( and higher ) saddles it is natural to ask whether or not    there is any chemical significance to the volume in the space of    `` bath modes '' enclosed by the contour defined by    @xmath175 .",
    "gap times and sampling .",
    ": :    can one develop a useful gap time formalism @xcite to    characterize rates of passage in and out of phase space regions    defined by the co - dimension one surfaces associated with index two    saddles ( and higher ) ?",
    "+    related to the gap time formalism , it has been shown that the dividing    surface provided by the normal form provides a natural surface on    which to sample initial conditions for trajectory calculations that    yield quanities of physical interest such as the reactant volume or    dissociation rate @xcite .",
    "does the normal form associated with    index two saddles yield manifolds on which a similar trajectory    sampling strategy can be implemented ? the manifolds @xmath136 , @xmath137 @xmath138 , and @xmath139 , a new type of nhim ? : :    we have been careful _ not _ to refer to the co - dimension one invariant    manifolds defined by @xmath136 , @xmath137    @xmath138 , and @xmath139 as `` nhims '' .",
    "there are    two reasons for this .",
    "the first is that they are not of the character    of the nhims associated with index one saddles , i.e. , compact and    boundaryless ( diffeomorphic to spheres ) , having ( invariant ) stable and    unstable manifolds ( locally ) partitioning the energy surface into    reactants and products , and `` persistent under perturbations ''    ( practically , this means that the manifolds maintain their character    for a range of energy above that of the saddle ) .",
    "the second is that    they do _ not _ immediately satisfy the hypotheses of the existing    normally hyperbolic invariant manifold theorems @xcite .",
    "this latter    point deserves more discussion . roughly speaking",
    ", the property of    `` normal hyperbolicity '' means that , under linearized dynamics , the    magnitude of the growth and decay of vectors normal to the manifolds    dominate the magnitude of the growth and decay of vectors tangent to    the manifold .",
    "the manifolds under consideration are obtained by    setting one coordinate to zero .",
    "therefore , the growth of vectors under    the linearized dynamics in the direction of the coordinate set to zero    describes the normal dynamics , and it is a simple matter to verify    that in this direction vectors are either exponentially growing or    decaying ( depending on the manifold under consideration ) .",
    "the problem    is that there will also be directions tangent to the manifold that are    exponentially growing or decaying .",
    "additionally , these manifolds are    _ not _ compact and boundaryless .",
    "sometimes this difficulty can be dealt    with through a consideration of `` overflowing '' or `` inflowing ''    invariance ( see @xcite for examples and related references ) .    nevertheless , the manifolds do exist for the normal form truncated at    _ any _ order , and this is sufficient for our purposes . using this    property , and",
    "the ideas and setting just described , it may be possible    to prove something like a `` persistence theorem for normally    hyperbolic invariant manifolds '' for this setting , but we do not    pursue that problem here .",
    "addressing several of these issues will require globalizing the invariant manifolds obtained in the vicinity of the saddle - saddle equilibribrium .",
