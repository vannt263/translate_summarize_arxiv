    "the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) has been found to be a powerful method for describing many - body systems . due to its simplicity , the proton - neutron qrpa is the nuclear structure method which has been most frequently used to interpret some nuclear structure aspects of the beta ( @xmath0 ) and double beta ( @xmath1 ) decay for open shell systems @xcite .",
    "the qrpa provides a description of excited states by including some nucleon - nucleon correlations in the ground state .",
    "the qrpa equations are derived directly from the equation of motion . in deriving the qrpa equations two basic approximations",
    "are adopted : ( i ) the operator , which determines the excited state , is taken as linear superposition of two creation and two annihilation quasiparticle operators by considering the bcs basis as reference .",
    "( ii ) the commutator of bifermion operators is replaced by its expectation value in the bcs ground state .",
    "this is usually called the `` quasiboson approximation '' ( qba ) .",
    "the qba violates the pauli exclusion principle ( pep ) and this affects severely the theory .",
    "the terms which are left out by the qba become more and more important when the ground state correlations are increased which results in a collapse of the qrpa solution .",
    "the approach based on the two approximations mentioned above will be conventionally called `` the standard qrpa approach '' .",
    "recently , the instability of the qrpa solution , caused by the pep violation received much attention from the experts in the field . in order to improve the reliability of the standard qrpa description of the nuclear transitions , the renormalized version of the qrpa ( rqrpa ) , which take into account",
    "the pep in an approximate way , has been formulated @xcite and applied to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay problems @xcite .",
    "indeed , the rqrpa does not collapse within the physical range of the interaction strength parameters .",
    "however , avoiding the collapse in the rqrpa a price had to be paid , namely the violation of the ikeda sum rule @xcite .",
    "there is a constant interest in studying the physical consequences of violating the pep by the qrpa solutions .",
    "some definite conclusions can be drawn by using solvable models , like , for example , the extensions @xcite to proton - neutron systems of lipkin or moszkowski models @xcite , as they simulate the realistic cases either by analytical solutions or by a minimal computational effort .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that the study of different many - body approximations within schematic models was always of great interest and moreover it is currently considered of a major importance @xcite .",
    "the improvement of the pep obedience , within the qrpa , can be achieved in two ways : ( i ) by a mapping technique the whole theory can be formulated in a boson picture . such an approach has been outlined for the proton - neutron monopole lipkin model in ref .",
    "( ii ) one can remain within the fermionic space and derive the elements of the qrpa equation , at least , perturbatively .",
    "usually approximations violating the pep are tested for fermi transition since for this case the schematic models are simple and solvable @xcite .",
    "recently a more general solvable model appeared @xcite that exploits the so(8 ) symmetry to include simultaneously the fermi and gamow - teller transitions .",
    "such a model is devoted to an extensive treatment of the proton - neutron pairing interaction .",
    "the goal of this work is to discuss some limitations of the standard qrpa approach , concerning the pep violation .",
    "we shall follow the second possibility mentioned above and introduce new extensions of the standard qrpa approach within the proton - neutron monopole lipkin model and point out some implications for realistic calculations .",
    "the newly introduced approximations will be compared with the exact results , revealing , in this way , the limits of the approximations .",
    "our work completes the discussion of the refs .",

    "this non - linear eigenvalue problem could be solved only numerically by an iteration process .",
    "the functional dependence of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 on @xmath55 and @xmath56 is specific to the approximation scheme and influences crucially the final results .",
    "below , we shall discuss , separately , several approaches .",
    "the simplest approximation scheme to calculate of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the quasiboson approximation ( qba ) , which assumes @xmath57 \\approx < |[a , a^\\dagger ] |>=1 $ ] , i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath59 are considered to be boson operators . here",
    "@xmath60 denotes the uncorrelated bcs ground state . in this case , one finds the expressions : @xmath61 which determine the excited state eigenenergy and wavefunction with normalization @xmath62 .",
    "the drawback of this approximation scheme is the collapse of the standard qrpa solution within the physically acceptable interval for the nucleon - nucleon interaction strength .",
    "the renormalized qrpa ( rqrpa ) approach avoids the collapse of the qrpa solution for physical parameters of the nuclear hamiltonian . within the rqrpa the commutator , @xmath63 $ ]",
    "is replaced with its expectation value in the ground state @xmath64|rpa>$ ] ( renormalized qba ) .",
    "this modifies the matrices @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 in the following way @xcite : @xmath65 note that the fermionic structure of the @xmath58 , @xmath66 operators is taken into account only in an approximate way . in the limit of @xmath67 ,",
    "i.e. the @xmath41 ground state is replaced by the bcs one @xmath60 , one gets the standard qrpa approach .",
    "it is worth to remark that in both the standard qrpa and the rqrpa , the elements @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are evaluated by using some approximate schemes for the commutator @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "if , i.e. the pep is fulfilled , the matrices @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 take the form : @xmath68 @xmath69 the calculation of the involved matrix elements requires the knowledge of the @xmath41 ground state , determined by the condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) . the analytical form for @xmath41",
    "is known within qba and renormalized qba . for the phonon operator given by the eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) , one obtains : @xmath70 where @xmath71 stands for the normalization factor .    in general , it is not possible to find an explicit expression for @xmath41 unless some additional approximation is adopted . fortunately , this can be achieved in the case of the solvable model considered in the present paper . by solving the eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) , one obtains @xmath72 with @xmath73    we note that if the ground state correlations are neglected in the calculation of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:20])([eq:22 ] ) , i.e. the rpa vacuum @xmath41 is replaced with bcs vacuum @xmath60 , one gets : @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "obviously , the standard qrpa equation is recovered in the limit @xmath77 , i.e. the bifermion operators @xmath78 and @xmath58 behave like bosons .    by using the approximate @xmath79 ( [ eq:23 ] ) and exact @xmath80 ( [ eq:24 ] ) solutions for the qrpa ground state , one achieves , in fact , new extensions of the standard qrpa approach , namely the and the , respectively .",
    "both methods go beyond the renormalized qrpa approach and require to evaluate ground state expectations values of the @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 operators entering the expression for @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:20])([eq:22 ] ) .",
    "this is performed free of any approximation .",
    "there is an important difference between this method and the rqrpa one , although both methods use the same ground state wave functions [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:22 ] ) ] .",
    "indeed , within the rqrpa , the commutator of the two bifermion operators @xmath58 and @xmath66 is considered in approximate way while the pp qrpa takes it exactly .",
    "indeed , the operators of interest have the expectation values : @xmath85 where the following notations have been used : @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 we hope that this approach can be applied also for realistic calculations and within a large model space . note that knowing @xmath79 , the qrpa matrices can be evaluated without the pep violation , at least perturbatively with respect to the factor @xmath89 .",
    "if the pertubative series is truncated to the quadratic terms in d , the resulting approach will be hereafter labeled by the abbreviation pp2 qrpa .",
    "this method can be formulated only for a solvable model for which the exact qrpa ground state can be analytically found . within the epp qrpa",
    "there is no violation of the pep .",
    "however , one can not expect that the epp qrpa solution coincides with the exact solution for the first excited state of the nuclear hamiltonian ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "the difference is caused by the approximations incorporated in the construction of the operator @xmath40 determining the excited state [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , from the direct comparison with the exact solution one may conclude how far the approximate description , with the phonon operator of a simple structure , is from the exact picture ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "the following expressions are used in elaborating the above defined procedure : @xmath90",
    "in what follow we shall present the numerical results for the qrpa approaches described in the previous section and compare them with the values provided by diagonalizing @xmath32 ( [ eq:5 ] ) . in order to continue and complete the discussion of this hamiltonian given in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have chosen the same set of parameters as there : @xmath91 which determine the bcs amplitudes entering the @xmath92 parameters of the model hamiltonian @xmath32 .",
    "also we redefine the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 as in refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath93    the values @xmath94 and @xmath95 were adopted while the particle - particle strength @xmath96 was allowed to vary in the interval @xmath97 . comparing the schematic calculations with the realistic ones , a value for @xmath96 close to unity is expected .      in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] we plotted the dependence of the qrpa excitation energy and the first excitation energy obtained by diagonalizing @xmath32 ( bold solid line ) on @xmath96 , for @xmath98 ( upper figure ) and @xmath95 ( lower figure ) , respectively .",
    "note that the standard qrpa breaks down for @xmath99 the rqrpa excitation energy remains real within the whole interval of @xmath96 , although it deviates significantly from the exact solution beyond the breaking down point of the standard qrpa .",
    "the effect is more evident for @xmath95 .",
    "the pp2 qrpa and , especially , the pp qrpa energies reproduce quite well those of @xmath32 , except for the values of @xmath96 approaching their minimum .",
    "the epp qrpa , which take into account the pep exactly , systematically overestimates the results obtained through the diagonalization of @xmath32 .",
    "this difference might be attributed to the simple form of the phonon operator @xmath40 ( [ eq:12 ] ) . from this figure one",
    "remarks that the collapse is shifted to a large value of @xmath96 when the pep is satisfied to a larger extent .",
    "for example for the pp2 qrpa , pp qrpa and epp qrpa , the collapse appear at about @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( @xmath95 ) , respectively .",
    "this indicates that a real phase transition could take place in the region beyond @xmath103 .      in order to get additional information about the quality of different approximations ,",
    "we calculate the expectation values of the quasiparticle number operator in the ground and first excited states .",
    "these are defined as follows : @xmath104 for the situations defined before , the results are : @xmath105    @xmath106    the expressions corresponding to the standard qrpa and rqrpa have been obtained by replacing the operator @xmath107 with its boson image , respectively . as for the remaining case we stay in the fermionic space and use the commutation algebra given by the eq .",

    "[ fig.2 ] and [ fig.3 ] , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , given by the above listed approximation schemes as well as the exact calculation are presented .",
    "one sees that the standard qrpa overestimates the ground state correlations near the collapse point , which reflects itself in a sudden increase of the average quasiparticle number .",
    "the rqrpa does not collapse at all and overestimates the exact result both for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "a distinct situation is produced by the qrpa approaches with pep .",
    "there occurs an underestimation of the ground state correlations and the values of @xmath108 are smaller than those corresponding to the exact solution . practically , there is no difference between the pp2 qrpa and the pp qrpa up to the point where the former one collapses .",
    "the epp qrpa , with an exact treatment of the pep , provides the best agreement with the exact results obtained by diagonalizing @xmath32 .",
    "we notice that none of the considered qrpa methods is able to reproduce the exact result for @xmath109 which , after a certain point in the region @xmath110 , is falling down , contrary to the behavior of other curves@xcite .",
    "this is an indication that a more complex form for the phonon operator might be necessary .",
    "we turn our attention now to transitions induced by the fermi @xmath111 operators .",

    "[ fig.4 ] and [ fig.5 ] we examine the behavior of the @xmath113 and @xmath115 amplitudes respectively as functions of @xmath96 for two values for @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "one notes a rapid increase of @xmath113 and decrease of @xmath115 transition strengths for the standard qrpa and the pp2 qrpa , close to their collapse point . in general , the pp2 qrpa , the pp qrpa and the epp qrpa methods reproduce better the trends of the exact results comparing them with the rqrpa .",
    "the best agreement with the exact values is achieved for the pp qrpa .",
    "obviously these analysis demonstrate how important it is to have a correct treatment of the pep , in describing the nuclear @xmath0 transitions .",
    "it is worth noting the sensitivity of the @xmath115 amplitude to the details of nuclear structure wave functions . indeed , by increasing the the particle - particle interaction strength @xmath120 , the matrix element of the @xmath115 transition operator reaches a vanishing value and therefore is no longer predictable .      from the @xmath111 amplitudes one obtains , straightforwardly , the @xmath111 strengths : @xmath121 for a ground state preserving the proton and neutron numbers in average",
    ", the two strengths are satisfying the ikeda sum rule @xmath122 where n and z are the numbers of neutrons and protons , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the ikeda sum rule is automatically fullfiled in the standard qrpa and violated in the rqrpa @xcite . according to the fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] , this is also true for the solvable model of this work .",
    "this figure shows also numerical results for the ikeda sum rule predicted by the methods described so far , and compare them with the exact results .",
    "one notices that the exact results for @xmath32 , do not fulfill the ikeda sum rule and show a large deviation from the value of ( n - z ) for @xmath123 for @xmath124 .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is expected to due to neglecting the scattering terms in the derivation of the assumed hamiltonian @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we hope that discrepancies concerning the ikeda sum rule are substantially diminished by adding the contributions due to the quasiparticle operators @xmath125 , @xmath126 involved in the particle number operators . indeed these contributions have been omitted so far , although their average on the ground state is not vanishing .",
    "one may conclude that the standard qrpa fails to reproduce the exact results for the chosen hamiltonian .",
    "all other modifications of the qrpa ( rqrpa , pp2 qrpa , pp qrpa , epp qrpa ) reproduce the trend of the exact solution , albeit the agreement with the exact results , for large value of @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) is rather poor . for non - vanishing @xmath123 the results lying closest to the exact ones are those produced by pp qrpa and fpp qrpa .",
    "a reason might be the influence of higher excited states on the ground state induced by the diagonalization procedure .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that improving the treatment of the pep in the qrpa , a better agreement of the ikeda sum rule with the ( n - z ) value is achieved .      in this section",
    "we shall focus our attention on the two - neutrino double beta decay mode , @xmath127 .",
    "consequences of the previously presented approaches on the @xmath127-decay matrix element will be discussed . within the solvable model considered here",
    "there is only one qrpa excited state and the corresponding nuclear @xmath127-decay matrix element takes the form @xmath128 here , the states with subscripts `` i '' and `` f '' are describing to the initial ( a , z ) and final ( a , z+2 ) nuclei , respectively .",
    "we considered @xmath129 to be equal to 0.5 mev and performed the calculations for the following set of parameters @xcite : @xmath130    results corresponding to the matrix element @xmath131 , calculated with different approximations , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.7 ] , as function of @xmath123 .",
    "in addition we present also the exact results of @xmath32 , considering only the contribution coming from the lowest intermediate state .",
    "one notices that the behaviors of the qrpa and the rqrpa curves are qualitatively similar to those found in the realistic calculations .",
    "the transition amplitude @xmath131 vanishes within the range @xmath132 for all calculations , including the exact ones .",
    "the values of @xmath131 obtained by a better consideration of the pauli exclusion principle ( pp qrpa and epp qrpa ) are significantly less sensitive to the particle - particle interaction strength @xmath123 .",
    "our studies show that the behavior of @xmath131 , as function of @xmath123 , is strongly influenced by the @xmath115 strength characterizing final nucleus .",
    "we have analyzed some limitations of the qrpa formalism in an solvable proton - neutron monopole lipkin model .",
    "in addition to the standard qrpa and rqrpa , we introduced new extensions of the standard qrpa approach by improving ( pp qrpa ) and exactly ( epp qrpa ) considering the pauli exclusion principle these approaches have been used to study the behavior of different observables as function of the particle - particle interaction strength @xmath123 .    due to the collapse of its solution for @xmath133 , the standard qrpa reproduces worse the exact results of the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "our studies show that the real collapse of the qrpa , usually associated to a phase transition , appears for a large value of @xmath123 ( @xmath134 ) . for the pp2 qrpa , which is obtained from the pp qrpa by cutting the series in d at second order",
    ", the solution breakdown appears around @xmath135 .",
    "this suggests that a better consideration of the pep , within the qrpa , shifts the instability strength to a larger value .    to shed more light on this problem we commented on the corrections induced by the ground state correlations , by plotting the average quasiparticle number versus @xmath123 .",
    "our analysis of the @xmath111 transitions shows the sensitivity of the @xmath115 transition to correlations , included in the ground state , which violate the pep . concerning the ikeda sum rule we have found that this is conserved neither by the exact solution of the quasiparticle nuclear hamiltonian nor by the qrpa methods including the pep .",
    "this discrepancy is very likely due to the structure of the model hamiltonian . also one expects , that including the contribution coming from the two quasiparticle and quasiparticle scattering operators entering the expressions of the particle number operators , the discrepancies are decreased .",
    "the @xmath127-decay matrix element , calculated within the solvable model , is changing the sign when @xmath123 is increased , similar to what happens in realistic calculations .",
    "it was pointed out that @xmath131 calculated by the pp qrpa and epp qrpa , is less sensitive to the details of nuclear structure than that predicted by the standard qrpa and rqrpa approaches .    in discussing the results of the pp2 qrpa , pp qrpa and epp qrpa we should keep in mind that the first two methods are just approximations of the last method . as expected ,",
    "the pp qrpa reproduces the epp qrpa solution better than the pp2 qrpa since it uses a complete pertubative expansion .",
    "the difference between the epp qrpa and exact solution originates in the simple form of the phonon operator which ignores nonlinear terms like for example those proportional to the @xmath136 and @xmath137 operators . to our knowledge",
    ", we are the first showing the inaccuracy coming exclusively from a simple form of the widely used phonon operator in the qrpa . an interesting point is the connection of the epp qrpa and the pp qrpa to the exact solution .",
    "we note that there is no principle reason which would determine that the epp qrpa results should reproduce the exact ones better than the pp qrpa .",
    "it turns out that the combined effect coming from the simple form of the phonon operator and the simple rpa wave functions , derived within quasiboson approximations , leads to a better agreement with exact solution for pp qrpa in some cases , e.g. for the lowest excitation energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) and @xmath115 transition amplitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] ) and worse for other observables .",
    "for example the epp qrpa reproduces the exact results better than pp qrpa when the expectation values of the quasiparticle number operators ( figs .",
    "[ fig.2 ] and [ fig.3 ] ) and ikeda sum rule ( fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] ) are calculated .",
    "new extensions of the standard qrpa with approximate ( pp qrpa ) and exact ( epp qrpa ) consideration of the pep were presented .",
    "these formalisms yield a better agreement with the exact results , obtained by diagonalizing the model hamiltonian , than the standard qrpa and the renormalized qrpa approaches .",
    "the epp qrpa results show that the collapse of the first excited states is far from the place where the standard qrpa breaks down , i.e. , is achieved for larger values of the particle - particle interaction strength .    the comparison of the epp qrpa results with those obtained with the exact eigenstates of @xmath32 , points out the drawbacks coming from the simple structure of the qrpa phonon operator and suggests a range of applicability for this theory .",
    "clearly , this analysis shows some limitations for the qrpa and rqrpa approaches .",
    "the results of the present paper support our hope that the pp qrpa approximations might work equally well in the case of realistic calculations for large model space , which are expected to offer more reliable results for the double beta decay transitions than the standard qrpa and the rqrpa ones .",
