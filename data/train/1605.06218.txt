    "the hydrodynamic motion of nanoparticles near elastic membranes plays an essential role in a variety of biological processes and medical applications .",
    "examples include the potential use of nanoparticles as drug delivery agents @xcite or possible adverse health effects due to nanoparticles generated , e.g. , from combustion processes and chemical industries @xcite .",
    "one of the strongest biological side effects is expected when nanoparticles are taken up by living cells through endocytosis @xcite for which the hydrodynamically governed approach towards the cell membrane is the essential first step .",
    "several theoretical and experimental studies have investigated particle dynamics near a single boundary such as a rigid wall @xcite or cylinder @xcite , a fluid - fluid interface @xcite , a partial - slip interface @xcite and an elastic membrane @xcite .",
    "the latter stands apart from both rigid and fluid interfaces as the stretching of the elastic membrane by the moving particle introduces a memory effect in the system .",
    "the influence of a second boundary on particle dynamics has so far been studied only for hard walls .",
    "the most simple approach is due to oseen @xcite who suggested that the hydrodynamic mobility of a sphere confined between two rigid walls could be approximated by superposition of the leading - order terms from each single wall .",
    "a more rigorous attempt goes back to faxn @xcite who computed in his dissertation the particle mobility parallel to the walls for the special cases when the particle is in the mid - plane or the quarter - plane between the two hard walls @xcite . for an arbitrary location between the two walls ,",
    "exact solutions for a point particle can be obtained in terms of convergent series using the image technique @xcite . for a truly extended particle , multipole expansions @xcite as well as",
    "joint analytical - numerical solutions have been presented @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the brownian dynamics of a spherical particle confined between two parallel rigid walls has been studied using direct imaging measurements in the parallel direction @xcite who found good agreement with oseen s superposition approximation .",
    "dynamic - light - scattering @xcite and video microscopy combined with optical traps @xcite also found good agreement with theoretical predictions . despite the significant progress in this field , the particle motion between two confining elastic interfaces has not been studied so far .",
    "an understanding of how the particle motion is affected by two adjacent elastic walls can be useful to model the diffusion of medical drugs across the extracellular space between neighboring cells @xcite or the transport of macromolecules across endothelial cells that line the surface of blood vessels @xcite .    in this paper , we derive an analytical theory for the translational motion of a small solid particle confined between two parallel elastic membranes with both shear and bending resistance .",
    "the theoretical predictions are confirmed by boundary integral simulations .",
    "we find that shearing and bending contributions are intrinsically coupled which is in strong contrast to the single - membrane case where shearing and bending parts are independent and add up linearly to produce the full particle mobility @xcite .",
    "we show that oseen s often used superposition approximation leads to a reasonably good prediction of the particle mobility only for the parallel , but not for the perpendicular motion , with errors in the mobility correction as high as @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the membrane deformation induced by the moving particle and show that the presence of the second membrane significantly reduces deformation compared to the single membrane case .",
    "finally , the subdiffusive nature of the brownian motion , which has recently been observed near a single membrane @xcite is shown to be further enhanced by the presence of the second membrane .",

    "the dirac delta function imposes the discontinuity of the second derivative at @xmath72 whereas the third derivative is continuous .",
    "afterward , the velocity component @xmath51 is immediately recovered thanks to the incompressibility equation  , giving access to the longitudinal - longitudinal component  @xmath82 .    what remains for the determination of the particle mobility is to apply the spatial inverse fourier transform by integrating over @xmath83 and the wavenumber @xmath84 . in the point particle approximation ,",
    "the mobility correction can readily be calculated by subtracting the bulk term and taking the limit when @xmath85 tends to @xmath12 , as described by eq .  .    for convenience ,",

    "these expressions are the basis for the computation of the brownian motion and therefore constitute one of the central results of our work .",
    "we proceed to investigate the limiting case of eq .",
    "in which both shearing and bending modulus tend to infinity and therefore @xmath97 and @xmath98 both tend to zero . in this case , which physically represents a hard wall , the general expression for @xmath99 as it appears in eq .",
    "reduces to    @xmath100    [ muhardwall ]    where we defined    @xmath101     expressions are valid for arbitrary positions of the upper wall given by @xmath102 . for specific values of @xmath8",
    "we recover three results obtained earlier : first , the single hard wall limits @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xcite are obtained for @xmath105 .",
    "second , the two wall case for @xmath106 and @xmath107 lead to the first order correction terms for the parallel motion as computed by faxn @xcite , namely @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "third , we find the result by felderhof @xcite for the perpendicular motion , @xmath110 .      in this subsection",
    "we address one particular aspect of the boundary conditions for the two membranes . in our recent work",
    "@xcite we found that the particle mobility near a single elastic membrane could be expressed as the linear combination of the two independent shear and bending contributions .",
    "for the two membrane case as discussed in the present work , however , the solution of eq .   requires to simultaneously consider the boundary conditions stated by eqs .   and .",
    "this is a qualitative difference compared to the one membrane case .    to see this ,",
    "consider two different setups , one with only bending resistance ( @xmath111 ) and one with only shear resistance ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "furthermore , let the corresponding perpendicular velocities be denoted by @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "if the expression @xmath115 should be the solution of two membranes with shear and bending resistance , it would have to fulfill the boundary conditions   and  .",
    "this is true if and only if @xmath116 which is in general satisfied only in the one membrane limit . as a result",
    ", the contributions from shearing and bending can not be added independently on top of each other in the resulting mobility corrections , defined by eq .  .",
    "a force acting on a particle will induce a motion in the fluid . as a result",
    ", the imbalance in the stress tensor across the membranes leads to their deformation . in this subsection",
    "we compute the deformation resulting from a time dependent point force located at @xmath72 , whereas the force is oriented perpendicularly or parallel to the membranes .",
    "once the fluid velocity field is computed in the whole domain , the displacement field for each membrane can be obtained via eq .  .",
    "for each membrane we define a frequency and wavevector dependent reaction tensor @xmath117 as @xmath118    for the perpendicular motion , the radial symmetry suggests that the displacement vector will have a normal component @xmath119 and a radial component @xmath120 . by performing the spatial inverse fourier",

    "we first note that from the transformation equations   @xmath124 since @xmath125 in virtue of the decoupled nature of eqs .   and  .",
    "thus , the spatial inverse fourier transform applied to the non - radially symmetric function @xmath126 leads to @xmath127 using the fact that @xmath128 and @xmath129 where @xmath130 .",
    "let us consider next the deformation due to a time dependent point force parallel to the membranes . due to the symmetry it suffices to consider a force applied along the @xmath28-direction .",
    "furthermore , this force can be decomposed into a longitudinal component @xmath131 and a transverse component @xmath132 . for the normal - tangential component @xmath133",
    ", it follows from the transformation equations   that @xmath134 since @xmath135 for the same reason as @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , the inverse fourier transform back into real space gives @xmath137 meaning that the vertical deformation is maximal in the plane @xmath138 containing the support of the vector force , and vanishes in the plane @xmath139 perpendicular to it .    to compute the lateral stretching of the membrane due to a parallel force on the particle",
    ", we require the components @xmath140 and @xmath141 giving access to the two in - plane displacements @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively .",
    "it follows immediately from applying the transformation equations   together with the definition of the reaction tensor eq .   that @xmath144 leading after spatial inverse fourier transform to @xmath145 similar , for @xmath141 we have @xmath146 whose inverse fourier transform is @xmath147    although not transparent from eq .",
    ", the deformation in the @xmath28-direction is maximal in the plane @xmath138 and minimal in the plane @xmath139 . on the other hand ,",
    "deformation is maximal for the @xmath29-direction in the bisector planes @xmath148 , and vanishes in the planes @xmath139 and @xmath138 . under the action of an arbitrary time dependent point force @xmath33 , the membrane deformation can subsequently be obtained by applying the temporal inverse fourier transform .",
    "for the simulations we use the boundary integral method ( bim ) @xcite whose foundation is the steady stokes equations .",
    "the core idea is to write them as an integral equation , made possible by the fact that we deal with a linear equation .",
    "however , treating rigid objects in the direct formulation is difficult and inefficient since it would lead to a fredholm equation of the first kind .",
    "instead , we employ an extension called the completed double layer boundary integral equation method ( cdlbiem ) @xcite . for the system with the two membranes the equations read    [ eq : cdl ] @xmath149    here , @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the surfaces of the two elastic membranes , and",

    "continuing , the function @xmath158 with @xmath159 is given by @xmath160 with @xmath161 being the particle centroid .",
    "we defined the single layer integral via @xmath162 where integration over both membrane surfaces @xmath150 needs to be performed .",

    "we discretize all surfaces with flat triangles . for the rigid particle , this",
    "is done by consecutively refining an icosahedron @xcite while gmsh @xcite was used for the membranes : the quadratic planes were meshed with triangles , with increasing resolution towards their center .",
    "we perform the integration numerically by a gaussian quadrature with seven points per triangle @xcite together with linear interpolation of nodal values across each triangle @xcite .",
    "the singularities appearing in the single layer integral are treated via the polar integration rule @xcite , while the singularities of the double layer integral are eliminated by the standard singularity subtraction scheme @xcite . with this the integral equation",
    "can be evaluated at all nodes , forming a dense and asymmetric linear system of equations which is then subsequently solved by gmres @xcite .",
    "the residuum of the solver was fixed to @xmath168 .",
    "this provides us with the velocity @xmath22 at each node of the two membranes and , after application of equation  , also of the rigid particle .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the system is hence obtained by solving the kinematic condition @xcite @xmath169 with the explicit euler scheme .",
    "we chose a step size that is dependent on the wiggling frequency of the force ( cf .",
    "the next section ) .      in order to obtain the frequency dependent particle mobility from the bim simulations , an oscillating force @xmath170 of amplitude @xmath171 and frequency @xmath172",
    "is exerted on the particle , in the direction perpendicular or parallel to the membranes .",
    "after an initial transitory evolution , the particle begins to oscillate with the same frequency as @xmath173 .",
    "the velocity amplitude @xmath11 and the phase shift @xmath35 can be accurately obtained by fitting the numerically recorded velocity .",
    "for that , we use a nonlinear least - squares solver based on the trust region method @xcite .",
    "the complex frequency dependent particle mobility can then be evaluated from @xmath174    for each applied frequency , the force is exerted during three periods in order to ensure that the steady state has been reached properly .",
    "therefore , lower frequencies require larger computation times . for instance , for @xmath175 , which is the",
    "lowest scaled frequency that we use in our simulations , each period requires around 30 hours using 40 cpus .",
    "we consider a spherical particle equally distant from both membranes @xmath176 and located at @xmath177 .",
    "the membrane reduced bending modulus , defined as @xmath178 , is taken to be @xmath179 .",
    "we examine the case where @xmath180 , for which the skalak model is equivalent to the common neo - hookean model @xcite for small deformations @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ cdl_twomem ] , the analytical and numerical results are in very good agreement for the whole range of the applied frequencies , similar as in earlier work for a single membrane @xcite .    for a frequency of zero ,",
    "the imaginary part vanishes . on the other hand ,",
    "the real part reaches its minimal value which corresponds to the two - hard - walls limit , namely @xmath181 and @xmath182 for the perpendicular and parallel motions , respectively .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier works @xcite .    by taking the frequency to infinity ,",
    "both the real and imaginary parts of the particle mobility correction vanish and one recovers the bulk behavior in which the particle motion is no longer affected by the presence of the membranes . in between , the imaginary part peaks around @xmath183 and @xmath184 for the perpendicular motion , and around @xmath183 for the parallel motion .",
    "the peak around @xmath183 , which is observed in both directions , is a shearing signature in the mobility correction , whereas the frequency peak around @xmath184 is a signature of bending .",
    "the latter is found to be insignificant in the parallel motion .",
    "physically , the peak frequencies correspond to the situation where the particle - membranes system naturally vibrates to absorb more energy .",
    "as already remarked , a commonly used approximation to compute mobilities between two walls is oseen s approach @xcite which assumes that the mobility corrections can be approximated by superposing the contributions from each membrane independently as @xmath185 which reduces in the two - hard - wall limit to @xmath186    the superposition approximation as given by eq .",
    "is compared in fig .",
    "[ cdl_twomem ] against our analytical predictions from eq .",
    "( see also the supporting material ) and numerical simulations in order to assess its accuracy .",
    "for the perpendicular motion , we observe that it only agrees well with the analytical predictions and the bim simulations for frequencies @xmath187 . at lower frequencies substantial disagreement is observed which , in the limit of a vanishing frequency ( hard - walls ) , amounts to @xmath0 .",
    "this deviation is due to the fact that the superposition approximation allows the fluid to drain away , as the no - slip boundary condition is no longer satisfied at both membranes simultaneously .",
    "as expected , it is therefore more pronounced the more the membrane deforms , i.e.  for smaller frequencies . on the other hand , for the motion parallel to the membranes ,",
    "the agreement is reasonable down to a dimensionless frequency @xmath97 of order unity .",
    "below that , however , a significant mismatch between the two curves is observed . in the limit for a vanishing frequency , a relative deviation of @xmath188 from faxn s value",
    "is obtained .",
    "all in all , the superposition approximation consistently underestimates the particle mobility .",
    "we now consider the membrane deformation induced by the moving particle .",
    "for this , we set the complex driving force to be harmonic with components @xmath189 , whose temporal fourier transform is @xmath190 . in this case , the membrane displacement is expressed as @xmath191 the physical displacement of the membrane is obtained by simply taking the real part of the right hand side in eq .  .",
    "[ shapemodulusall_cdl ] depicts a comparison of the membrane displacements between analytical predictions and bim simulations .",
    "here we use the same set of parameters as in fig .",
    "[ cdl_twomem ] .",
    "as the particle is equally distant from both membranes , the displacement fields of each membrane are equal in magnitude , but may differ in sign .",
    "for instance , for a particle moving perpendicularly to the membranes , the normal displacements of each membrane have the same sign whereas the radial displacements have opposite signs .",
    "however , the vertical displacements in the parallel motion have different signs from each other whereas the in - plane displacements have similar signs .",
    "hereafter , all the components are evaluated in their plane of maximal displacement : @xmath119 and @xmath142 in the plane @xmath138 and @xmath143 in the plane @xmath192 .",
    "the theoretical predictions are found to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations for both the perpendicular and parallel motions .",
    "the reason behind the small discrepancy between theory and simulation is most likely the fact that the analytical theory treats truly infinite membranes whereas the corresponding bim simulations necessarily only account for finite sized membranes .    in the perpendicular motion ,",
    "the deformation is more pronounced in the normal than in the @xmath28-direction .",
    "the maximum displacement for the first occurs at the center .",
    "far away , the membrane deformation decays rapidly with distance and vanishes as @xmath28 tends to infinity . on the other hand",
    ", radial symmetry implies that the displacement @xmath120 should vanish at the origin , suggesting the existence of an extremum at some intermediate radial position .",
    "the latter is found to be in magnitude around 40 times smaller than that obtained for the normal displacement .",
    "accordingly , the in - plane deformation does not play a significant role for the motion perpendicular to the membranes .    considering the translational motion parallel to the membranes , we observe that the displaced membranes exhibit a fundamentally different shape .",
    "not surprisingly , it turns out that the in - plane deformation @xmath142 along the direction parallel to the applied force is the most significant .",
    "the maximum displacements reached in @xmath119 and @xmath143 are respectively found to be about twice and 10 times smaller in comparison with that reached in @xmath142 .",
    "membrane deformability is largely determined by shearing and bending properties .",
    "henceforth , we shall consider a typical case for which both effects have the same relevance .",
    "thus , before we can continue , we define the characteristic time scale for shearing as @xmath193 and the characteristic time scale for bending as @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "both time scales are equal for a distance @xmath195 .",
    "we adapt this value for the remainder of this section .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath196 .",
    "it is also of interest to compute the maximum displacement ( amplitude ) of the membrane during the particle oscillation .",
    "the maximum is not necessarily reached for @xmath197 , as taken in fig .",
    "[ shapemodulusall_cdl ] . in fig .",
    "[ omega_effect ] , we show the effect of frequency on the oscillation amplitude .",
    "higher frequencies induce smaller deformation , because the membrane does not have enough time to respond to the fast particle wiggling . by comparing the reaction tensor amplitudes with and without a second membrane , we see that the presence of a second membrane reduces @xmath198 less strongly than @xmath199 .",
    "this is similar to the observations for the msd in the next section ( see fig .",
    "[ cdl_twomemdiffusion ] ) .    in order to examine the effect of the disposition of the upper membrane relative to the lower one",
    ", we define the following ratios of the reaction tensor amplitudes between the upper and lower membranes : @xmath200 these are two quantities that vanish for @xmath201 and are equal to one for @xmath106 . in fig .",
    "[ sigma_effect ] , we plot the variations of @xmath202 and @xmath203 as functions of the scaled distance from the membrane center for different values of @xmath8 . here",
    "the calculations are carried out in the plane of maximal displacement @xmath138 , for a scaled frequency of @xmath204 .",
    "we remark that the upper membrane shows significantly less vertical displacement as @xmath8 increases ( ratio less than unity . )",
    "further apart from the center , where less deformation occurs , the two membranes have an essentially comparable deformation behavior , and both ratios approach the upper limit one as @xmath28 increases .",
    "the computation of the particle mean - square displacement ( msd ) requires as an intermediate step the determination of the velocity autocorrelation function @xmath205 .",
    "the latter is related to the temporal inverse fourier transform of the particle mobility via kubo s fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) such that @xcite @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath208 the absolute temperature of the system .",
    "the bar denotes complex conjugate .",
    "the particle msd is computed as @xmath209 for convenience , we define the excess msd as @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the bulk diffusion coefficient given by the einstein relation @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ cdl_twomemdiffusion ] the variations of the perpendicular and parallel excess msds as computed from eq .   versus the scaled time .",
    "for short times , the particle does not yet perceive the membranes and thus experiences a bulk diffusion . by increasing the time up to @xmath212 ,",
    "the effect of the confining membranes becomes noticeable . by comparing the total excess msds for @xmath213 and @xmath106 we find that diffusion in the long - time limit",
    "is slowed down by a factor 1.78 for the parallel direction , but only a factor 1.29 in the perpendicular direction , due to the introduction of the second membrane .    as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : coupling ] , the particle mobility and , consequently , also the msd can not be split up directly into a shear and bending contribution for the two membrane case .",
    "we therefore consider the two cases separately , taking one membrane with @xmath111 and one with @xmath112 .",
    "we find that for the shear - only membrane ( @xmath112 , blue curve in fig .",
    "[ cdl_twomemdiffusion ] ) the time needed to reach the steady state is about @xmath214 for the perpendicular motion , and about @xmath215 for the parallel motion . on the other hand , the bending - only membrane ( @xmath111 , red curve in fig .  [ cdl_twomemdiffusion ] ) takes for both directions a significantly longer time of about @xmath216 before the steady state is attained .",
    "another way to quantify the slowing down of the particle is to investigate the time - dependent scaling exponent of the msd , which can be defined as @xmath217 fig .",
    "[ scalingexpo ] shows the temporal evolution of the scaling exponent which strongly depends on the distance separating the particle from the membranes .",
    "we first remark that the scaling exponent is @xmath218 at @xmath219 and for @xmath220 .",
    "the particle thus experiences normal diffusion in these cases . this is similar to the single - membrane case @xcite . for @xmath212 ,",
    "we observe a bending down of the scaling exponent , resulting in a subdiffusive regime that extends up to 10@xmath221 in the parallel and even further in the perpendicular direction . in fig .",
    "[ minimalscalingexpo ] we present the variation of the minimal scaling exponent for @xmath106 and @xmath222 upon varying the particle - membrane distance . for @xmath223 , the exponent is found to be as low as 0.75 for the perpendicular motion , and 0.86 for the parallel motion .",
    "these values are significantly smaller than the ones previously found in the one - membrane limit ( @xmath213 ) @xcite , where the scaling exponent is around 0.89 and 0.92 for the perpendicular and parallel motions , respectively .",
    "we therefore conclude that the second membrane leads to a notable slow - down of the dynamics .",
    "we have investigated the translational motion of a spherical particle confined between two parallel elastic membranes and determined the frequency dependent mobility for the motion perpendicular and parallel to the membranes in the point particle limit .",
    "contrary to the single wall , shear and bending are intrinsically coupled and their contributions can not be added linearly .",
    "our analytical predictions have been compared to boundary integral simulations for a finite - sized particle and very good agreement has been observed .",
    "the frequently used superposition approximation , originally suggested by oseen @xcite for two hard walls , has been tested for elastic membranes . reasonably good agreement with the analytically exact predictions is observed for the parallel , but not for the perpendicular motion , especially in the low frequency regime .",
    "subsequently , we have provided analytical predictions validated by numerical simulations of the membrane deformation due to a particle upon which an oscillating force is exerted perpendicular or parallel to the membranes .",
    "we have observed that the deformation is most pronounced in the direction along which the force acts , and that the presence of the second membrane significantly reduces the membrane deformations .",
    "finally , we have shown that the elastic membranes induce a memory effect in the system , leading to a subdiffusive brownian motion at intermediate time scales .",
    "this is qualitatively similar , yet more pronounced , as in the single membrane situation @xcite . to provide typical physical values ,",
    "consider a red blood cell with a shear modulus of @xmath224 and a bending modulus of @xmath225 that flows in a fluid with dynamic viscosity @xmath226 @xcite .",
    "a typical nanoparticle of radius @xmath227 that is located at a distance of @xmath228 from both red blood cells will undergo a long - lived subdiffusive motion that can last up to @xmath229 .",
    "the corresponding scaling exponent of the msd can go as low as 0.77 in the perpendicular and as low as 0.87 in the parallel direction .    in the future",
    ", it will be interesting to carry out similar calculations in more severe confinements such as cylindrical elastic channels where even stronger effects are expected .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the volkswagen foundation and the konwihr network as well as computing time granted by the leibniz - rechenzentrum on supermuc .",
    "in this appendix , we provide some technical details regarding the computation of the traction jump @xmath164 across the membranes , as required for eq .  .",
    "the membranes are endowed with shear and area elasticity together with some bending rigidity .",
    "the strain invariants @xmath231 and @xmath232 are related to the principal in - plane stretch ratios via @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "hence , the total energy of a membrane @xmath235 is given by @xmath236 where the integration is performed over the surface in the reference state @xmath237 . in our case",
    "this is a simple flat sheet . to obtain the force at each node",
    ", we assume that the deformation is a linear function of position in each triangle .",
    "after discretization of the integral the energy @xmath238 depends explicitly on the node positions @xmath239 .",
    "therefore , according to the principle of virtual work , the total force is then given by the gradient @xmath240 this derivative can be computed analytically as detailed in references  @xcite .",
    "the traction jump is thus obtained by @xmath241 whereas @xmath242 is the area associated with node @xmath239 and is taken as one third of the total area of the triangles containing the node @xcite .",
    "the bending forces are modeled according to the constitutive law proposed by canham @xcite and helfrich @xcite , which for a flat reference state becomes @xmath243 @xmath244 denotes the mean curvature and @xmath245 the bending modulus .",
    "applying the principle of virtual work is possible _ before _ the discretization , leading to the following contribution to the traction jump @xcite : @xmath246 the mean curvature @xmath244 is calculated according to the relation @xmath247 .",
    "we use the algorithms presented by meyer _",
