    "several new physics models suggest large enhancement up to a few orders of magnitude in the branching ratio , and @xmath0 is a powerful tool for searching for new physics  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this decay has not yet been observed and its upper limit of @xmath4 ( 90% cl ) was given so far ( kek - e391a  @xcite ) .",
    "the koto experiment  @xcite is an experiment dedicated to observing the @xmath0 decay for the first time , using an intense kaon beam at japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc )  @xcite .",
    "we use an upgraded detector from the kek - e391a which was the pilot experiment for the koto experiment .",
    "the koto experiment was designed to achieve the single event sensitivity of @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : kotodetector ] shows a schematic view of the koto detector .",
    "the signature of the @xmath0 consists of two photons from a @xmath6 decay with no other particles detected .",
    "the position and energy of each of the two photons are measured by a csi electromagnetic calorimeter . the decay - vertex position and the transverse momentum of @xmath6",
    "are reconstructed to identify the decay .",
    "hermetic neutral and charged particle detectors ( veto detectors ) surround the decay region in order to ensure that no extra particles exist .",
    "the hermetic detector system plays an essential role to achieve a background rejection factor of @xmath7 required for the experiment .",
    "the charged veto ( cv ) is located in front of the csi electromagnetic calorimeter , and detects charged particles entering the calorimeter .",
    "almost all the charged decay modes of @xmath8 have two charged particles ; if two charged particles fly toward the csi calorimeter and are misidentified as two gammas , such an event can be a background .",
    "decay , if @xmath9 and @xmath10 have a charge exchange interaction ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) before @xmath9 or @xmath10 are detected by the cv , and particles at final states are not detected by any veto counters , @xmath13 can be backgrounds .",
    "] there are about @xmath14 times more @xmath8 decays that include charged particles than the expected signal .",
    "the cv is required to reject such background events by more than a factor of @xmath15 , after other detectors are used to suppress the background . to achieve this goal",
    ", we installed two layers of plastic scintillators as the cv to cover the upstream surface of the calorimeter .",
    "the two charged particles from the @xmath8 mainly make four hits on the two layers of the cv .",
    "because the total reduction is expected to be the fourth power of the inefficiency of each layer , we can achieve the required background reduction if the charged particle inefficiency is less than 10@xmath16 for each layer .",
    "we developed and evaluated a new detector for the cv to achieve the requirement .",
    "we used plastic scintillator strips with wavelength - shifting ( wls ) fibers embedded for the cv .",
    "strips of these scintillators are arranged to cover the whole region of the calorimeter .",
    "the segmentation is necessary to reduce the counting rate per readout channel .",
    "it was designed with three functionalities : minimal interaction , small inefficiency , and good timing resolution .",
    "first , the low mass feature is required to minimize neutron interaction at the cv because of the following reason . at the neutral beam line for the koto experiment ( kl beam line ) ,",
    "a small fraction of neutrons remains in the halo region of the beam .",
    "if a neutron interacts with the cv and generates a @xmath17 or @xmath18 , two photons from the @xmath17 or @xmath18 decay can fake a signal . to reduce such events",
    ", the mass of the cv must be as low as possible .",
    "second , small inefficiency is essential to achieve the koto goal . in other words , high light yield should be maintained , and there should be no gaps between the scintillator strips . the cv needs to have more than 10  photoelectrons ( p.e . ) per @xmath19 energy deposit to achieve an inefficiency level of less than 10@xmath16 at a 100 kev threshold threshold enables the cv to detect charged pions which pass through the scintillator by more than 0.5 mm before a charge exchange interaction , with the inefficiency less than @xmath20@xcite .",
    "a counting loss occurs when a charged pion makes the charge exchange interaction ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) and gives a small energy deposit in the scintillator .",
    "this threshold is small enough to suppress the background from the @xmath23 decay . ] , according to our simulation study .",
    "if we reduce the thickness of the scintillator to suppress the interaction of the neutrons , the light yield decreases because the number of reflections increases and the light is attenuated at every reflection . this would increase the inefficiency .",
    "using wls fibers embedded in the plastic scintillators enabled the cv to reduce the effects of attenuation .",
    "the fibers absorb blue light ( @xmath24 ) from the scintillator and emit green light ( @xmath25 ) , which is expected to have a longer attenuation length .",
    "the light from the fibers are read at both ends by multi pixel photon counters ( mppcs ) .",
    "mppcs have an approximately 2.5 times higher detection efficiency for green light ( @xmath26 at @xmath27  @xcite ) than ordinary photomultipliers .",
    "the arrangement of the scintillator strips without gaps is important to minimize the inefficiency , which will be discussed later .",
    "third , the cv is required to have a good timing resolution .",
    "a poor timing resolution requires a wider timing window to keep a sufficient efficiency , and causes event loss due to accidental hits .",
    "the timing resolution is required to be less than @xmath28 to suppress the event loss to lower than 5% .",
    "the cv consists of two layers of plastic scintillators .",

    "the histogram labeled `` non - penetrating '' shows the events in which an uncharged particle hit the corresponding cv strip , according to the true information obtained from the simulation .",
    "the histogram for the simulation was normalized to the number of measured ' ' near \" tracks for ( a ) , and inefficient events for ( b ) , in each plot.,width=453 ]    [ [ results - of - inefficiency - measurements ] ] results of inefficiency measurements + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the raw inefficiency was corrected by the equation @xmath99 the results were @xmath100 and @xmath101 , for the front and rear layers , respectively , where the first errors are statistical and the second errors are systematic .",
    "the source of the systematic errors is dominated by those from @xmath83 and @xmath95 ; other sources , such as the stability of energy deposit , deviation of each cut were small and were thus neglected .",
    "we investigated the hit position of the inefficient tracks on the cv .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ineffposi ] , the majority of the inefficient points were found to be located near the cutouts or on the edges of the scintillator strips , and not in the central region .",
    "this may be regarded as evidence that the cv was built as designed .",
    "finally , we set the upper limit of the inefficiency from @xmath102 . assuming poisson statistics , the upper limit was found to be 1.5 @xmath103(90%c.l . ) and 1.5 @xmath103(90% c.l . ) for the front and rear layers , respectively . we conclude that cv achieved high efficiency(@xmath104 of inefficiency ) and satisfied the requirements for the koto experiment .",
    "we developed a low - mass and high - efficiency charged particle detector for the koto experiment at j - parc .",
    "two layers of 3-mm - thick plastic scintillators with embedded wavelength - shifting fibers , each of which was read by mppcs , were manufactured .",
    "the mppc , which has 3 mm @xmath77 3  mm sensitive area and is equipped with a thermoelectric cooler , was newly developed for this purpose . after completing the construction ,",
    "performance studies were conducted at the neutral kaon beam line for the koto experiment in the j - parc hadron experimental facility .",
    "we measured the light yield , the timing resolution , and the inefficiency against penetrating charged particles .",
    "the resultant light yield per 100  kev energy deposit was 18.6  p.e .",
    "on average , and the timing resolution of the scintillator strips was measured to be 1.2  ns . in particular , the detection inefficiency against the particles which penetrated the cv , per layer , was less than @xmath2 over the area within a radius of 850 mm .",
