    "the reprocessing of external x - rays by accreting material has been observed from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) for over a decade ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these objects ,",
    "the origin and location of the illuminating x - ray power - law is largely unknown , although it is widely believed to be either within a magnetic accretion disc corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a centrally located geometrically thick flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , many models of x - ray reflection from black hole accretion discs have been computed @xcite , and , in some cases , successfully applied to data @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered an fe  k@xmath0  line and edge in the x - ray spectra of the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) 4u  182030  as it was undergoing a superburst  a powerful thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the neutron star that can last many hours @xcite .",
    "based on the strength of the fe  k@xmath0  line , these authors suggested that the features were caused by reflection of the burst blackbody spectrum from the surrounding accretion disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . this hypothesis was supported by spectral fitting with detailed reflection models @xcite .",
    "the unique aspect of reflection during a burst from a lmxb is that there is no uncertainty in the location of the x - ray source , as it is located on the surface of the neutron star and outshines the persistent x - ray emission from the disc .",
    "this fact allows for far less ambiguity when analyzing changes to the reflection features , as they are more likely to trace the evolution in the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission lines have also been observed in the persistent emission from lmxbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and these are also thought to be caused by reprocessing by matter in the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the spectral shape of the persistent emission is consistent with bremsstrahlung with a temperature of 510  kev  @xcite , most likely arising from the boundary layer between the disc and the neutron star .",
    "detailed models of the photoionized layer on the disc have been performed and predict a wealth of emission lines in the soft x - ray band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that can be compared against observations made with the grating spectrometers onboard _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , a x - ray burst emits a blackbody spectrum @xcite , and can reach the eddington luminosity ( @xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 ) , well over an order of magnitude greater than the persistent luminosity of many lmxbs @xcite .",
    "thus , disc reflection will be dominated by the blackbody component during the burst .",
    "this paper presents reflection spectra from a uniform accretion disc illuminated by a blackbody , as in a lmxb during a type  i x - ray ( super)burst . these spectra were used to fit the superburst data of 4u  182030  @xcite , but , as shown below , they contain much more information than what was actually needed for those _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) data . observations of reflection features from type  i bursts or superbursts with sensitive , large bandwidth instruments such as the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on _ swift _ could provide a wealth of new information on the structure and behaviour of accretion discs .    in the next section we outline the reflection calculations , and present the resulting spectra in section  [ sect : res ] .",
    "we conclude by discussing the results in section  [ sect : discuss ] .",
    "the reflection spectra were computed using the code of @xcite .",
    "details of the computational techniques can be found in that paper and in references therein ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , and so only a brief overview will be presented here .    a one - dimensional slab of material with a constant hydrogen number density @xmath4 is illuminated by a blackbody spectrum with temperature @xmath1 and flux ( defined between 1  ev and 100  kev ) @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we define the ionization parameter @xmath6 the input radiation is transferred into the layer using the two - stream approximation @xcite while the outgoing radiation is treated using the modified fokker - planck / diffusion method of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the output spectrum is averaged over all viewing angles .",
    "the ionization and thermal structure of the illuminated gas is iterated until each zone reaches ionization and thermal balance , and at this point the final reflection spectrum is computed .",
    "the illuminated slab always has a large enough thomson depth ( @xmath7620 , depending on @xmath8 ) so that the highest energy photons will interact many times with the gas .",
    "the cosmic abundances of @xcite were assumed , but hydrogen and helium are taken to be completely ionized at all times ( i.e. , @xmath9 ) .",
    "the following ionization stages of the most important astrophysical metals are treated in the calculation : c  v  vii , n  vi  viii , o  v  ix , mg  ix  xiii , si  xi  xv and fe  xvi  xxvii .",
    "models were calculated for @xmath10  kev , as this spans the range most often observed during x - ray bursts @xcite , and for @xmath11 . to change @xmath8 , @xmath4",
    "was fixed at 10@xmath12  @xmath13 , and @xmath5 was varied .",
    "we begin by considering the evolution of the reflection spectra as a function of @xmath8 ( cf .",
    "fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows a series of spectra for four different values of @xmath1 .",
    "each panel shows reflection spectra with @xmath14 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 3.5 ( from bottom to top ) , thereby spanning the range from very weakly ionized reflectors to highly ionized ones . for the @xmath15 model ,",
    "we have also plotted the incident blackbody spectrum .    unlike the power - law continua of agn and gbhcs where the radiant energy per frequency decade reaches a maximum at energies @xmath16  kev(for photon - indices @xmath17 ) where atomic absorption is minimal , the blackbody spectra peak at energies where the photoelectric absorption by metals is very important . as a result",
    ", only a small fraction of the photons incident on the slab are scattered back without first being absorbed by an ion .",
    "the reflection spectra therefore only mimics a blackbody at energies @xmath18  kev , with the agreement increasing as @xmath19 grows and the metals are ionized .",
    "the energy absorbed by the metals in the gas is thermalized and reemerges as a strong soft free - free continuum with a variety of recombination lines superimposed . as this thermal emission includes the power absorbed at higher energies , it outshines the incident blackbody at @xmath20  kev  for all values of @xmath8 considered .",
    "the rich emission line spectrum is reminiscent of those predicted from models of reprocessing of the persistent emission @xcite .",
    "however , in the most luminous stage of an x - ray burst , the disc may be severely ionized @xcite , and will leave a compton broadened o  viii ly@xmath0 line as the only emission feature in the soft x - ray region of the spectrum .",
    "it is instructive to look at the most important heating and cooling processes within the illuminated layer .",
    "a plot of the heating and cooling rates as a function of thomson depth into the slab for the @xmath21 , @xmath22  kev  model is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : rates ] .",
    ", @xmath22  kev  reflection calculation as a function of thomson depth into a slab with @xmath23  @xmath13 .",
    "the upper panel plots the iron ionization structure . moving from the surface down into the slab ,",
    "the iron ions encountered are fe  xxvii ( long - dashed line ) , hydrogenic fe  xxvi ( solid line ) , fe  xxv ( short - dashed line ) , fe  xvii  xxiv ( dotted lines ) and fe  xvi ( solid line ; the most neutral iron ion treated ) .",
    "the lower panel plots the ( h)eating ( red curves ) and ( c)ooling ( blue curves ) rates and the gas temperature ( right - hand axis ; black solid line ) .",
    "the line types distinguish the various physical processes : compton heating / cooling ( dotted lines ) , free - free heating / cooling ( short - dashed lines ) , recombination heating / cooling ( long - dashed lines ) , photoelectric heating / line cooling ( dot - short - dashed lines ) , and three - body interactions ( dot - long - dashed lines).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this figure , the heating and cooling processes are shown by red and blue lines respectively , while the different line styles separate the physical process ( for example , compton heating is denoted by the red dotted line , but compton cooling is shown with the blue dotted line ) . the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] shows the final iron ionization structure in the slab .",
    "hydrogenic iron dominates between the surface and the first thomson depth , but recombines to he - like fe before reaching @xmath24 .",
    "the iron recombines rapidly just beyond this point and reaches the lowest ionization stage treated ( fe  xvi ) at @xmath25 .",
    "turning to the heating and cooling rates , we see that free - free emission is the dominant cooling mechanism over the entire depth of the slab . at the surface , where the gas temperature reaches @xmath26  k ( the black line in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] ) , the bremsstrahlung cooling is balanced by compton and photoelectric heating .",
    "however , the compton heating rate falls rapidly with @xmath27 because there are very few high energy photons in the incident blackbody spectra .",
    "in contrast , the photoelectric heating rate increases with @xmath27 until it reaches a maximum at @xmath28 , where iron is rapidly recombining ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] ) and the photoionization rates jumps .",
    "the line cooling rate also increases rapidly here , but can not overcome the free - free cooling .",
    "after the iron has almost fully recombined at @xmath29 , the photoelectric heating rate falls ( very few ionizing photons can penetrate to such depths ) and the dominant heating process becomes free - free absorption .",
    "the line - cooling rate jumps one more time at @xmath30 where oxygen is recombining ( note the corresponding fall in the gas temperature ) . the dominance of free - free cooling and photoelectric heating in the thermal structure of the illuminated slab emphasizes the dominance of the absorption - thermalization process in these models .",
    "the observational outcome is the rich x - ray line spectrum seen below 1  kev  in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "similar to the reflection spectra predicted for the environment of accreting black holes , the fe  k@xmath0  line is the most important spectral feature above @xmath31  kev  in the blackbody models , and is an important indicator of the ionization parameter of the reflecting medium .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] shows that in each panel the fe  k@xmath0  line evolves from a strong 6.4  kev  line to a weak , auger - destroyed line , and then to a broad 6.7  kev  feature before disappearing entirely due to the complete ionization of iron .",
    "this is the same sequence as that presented by @xcite for illumination by a power - law .",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe  k@xmath0  line as a function of @xmath19 is shown in figure  [ fig : ews ] .",
    "equivalent width ( ew ) as a function of @xmath19 for the four values of @xmath1 shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the upper panel plots the ew measured from the pure reflection spectrum ( i.e. , there is no contribution from the blackbody ) .",
    "the lower panel plots the ew measured from the sum of the reflected and incident spectra . in both panels the different line types separate the values of @xmath1 : 1.5  kev  ( solid line ) , 2  kev  ( dotted line ) , 2.5  kev  ( short - dashed line ) , and 3  kev  ( long - dashed line).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the top panel shows the ews measured from the reflection spectra themselves , while the lower panel includes the diluting effect of adding in the incident blackbody that will also be observed along with the reflection spectrum .",
    "the measurements were made for the four values of @xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , but for 75 values of @xmath19 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 . there are two peaks in the ew evolution : one when @xmath34 and fe  k@xmath0  is at 6.4  kev , and the other when @xmath35 and the line is at 6.7  kev .",
    "the ew of the cold line is much stronger than the ionized one in the case of pure reflection , but is switched when the incident blackbody is included .",
    "this is because at larger values of @xmath8 there is less metal absorption in the illuminated slab and the reflection spectrum is not as diluted by the blackbody as in the low @xmath8 models .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0  ew is a strong linear function of the temperature of the blackbody ; for example , when @xmath36 and the incident blackbody is included , the ew increases from @xmath37  ev ( at @xmath38  kev ) to @xmath39  ev ( at @xmath40  kev ) .",
    "this is a result of the increase in photons above the iron k edge ( at @xmath41@xmath42  kev ) as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "this has important implications for the study of x - ray bursts , because the blackbody emission is at its hottest when the burst is brightest . therefore , unless iron is fully ionized by the burst ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , the fe  k@xmath0  line should be most prominent at the point where the burst is most easily observable",
    ". however , a superburst may cause changes in the accretion geometry close to the neutron star which would reduce the reflection amplitude and the ew of the fe  k@xmath0  line @xcite .",
    "searches for spectral features during x - ray bursts from neutron stars have been ongoing for many years .",
    "since the explosion is occurring on the surface of the star , the spectral features would be expected to be redshifted and would therefore be a measure of the mass - to - radius ratio of the star ( via @xmath44 ) , a number needed to constrain the many possible equations of state of nuclear matter . during the 1980s",
    "there were a few reports of x - ray absorption lines at 4.1  kev  during type  i x - ray bursts @xcite , which were interpreted as redshifted ly@xmath0 absorption from he - like iron .",
    "however , the equivalent width of these absorption lines were on the order of hundreds of ev , which theoretical models of spectral formation in burst atmospheres could not reproduce @xcite .",
    "observations by more sensitive instruments on _ rxte _ and _ bepposax _ have been unable to discover any other examples of a 4.1  kev  absorption line . recently , the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) on _ xmm - newton _ has uncovered evidence for redshifted absorption lines during the x - ray bursts of exo  0748 - 676 @xcite , although data from 28 bursts were needed in order to obtain the minimum signal - to - noise necessary to find the lines .",
    "as first suggested by @xcite , x - rays from an explosion on a neutron star can be reprocessed by the surrounding accretion disc , leading to features such as an fe  k@xmath0  line and edge .",
    "the analysis of these features can lead to many new insights about the structure and evolution of the accretion disc @xcite , as well as basic information about the neutron star itself .",
    "for example , if the emission lines are relativistically broadened then modeling can reveal the inclination angle of the system to the line of sight @xcite , a parameter often needed to obtain masses of the neutron star and its binary companion .",
    "modeling of relativistic lines also produce a radius where the reflection originates ( assuming some emissivity profile ) .",
    "this radius is measured in gravitational units ( @xmath45 ) , so if the mass of the neutron star is known , the radius can be converted to physical units , allowing a determination of a mass - to - radius ratio .",
    "since the reflection may occur very close to the surface of the neutron star ( @xmath46@xmath47  @xmath45 in 4u  1820 - 30 ; @xcite ) , the measurement may provide a useful lower - limit to the @xmath48 ratio for the neutron star .",
    "_ rxte _ has so far been the most successful telescope to obtain time - resolved spectroscopy of x - ray bursts , especially of the more energetic superbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the telescope produces data for energies greater than 3  kev  which allows a good determination of the blackbody spectrum and , if detected , the fe  k@xmath0line . yet",
    ", the reflection models predict a wealth of information at energies less than 3  kev  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) that can provide further constraints on the abundances , ionization state and dynamics of the accretion disc .",
    "these features will also strongly depend on the density of the disc because of the importance of collisional effects and free - free emission / absorption .",
    "the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] were calculated assuming a density of @xmath23  @xmath13 , appropriate for the outer regions of the disc .",
    "the density at a distance of a few gravitational radii from the neutron star is expected to be @xmath49  @xmath13 , even for a radiation - pressure dominated disc @xcite , which is beyond the range of validity for the reflection code .",
    "to illustrate the effects of higher density on the soft x - ray spectrum , figure  [ fig : densitycompare ] compares three reflection spectra computed with @xmath23  @xmath13 with ones computed at @xmath50  @xmath13 , where the code remains valid .",
    "@xmath13 , while the dotted lines denote models with identical @xmath8 but with @xmath23  @xmath13 .",
    "a @xmath22  kev  blackbody was the illuminating continuum for all cases .",
    "the increase in density results in only minor differences in the spectra at energies @xmath51  kev , but there are significant changes at lower energies.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the figure shows very little difference in the spectra in the _ rxte _ band including the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "this implies that the fe  k@xmath0ews computed from the @xmath23  @xmath13 models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ews ] ) should still be useful guidelines for future observations .",
    "on the other hand , the three order of magnitude increase in density significantly alters the soft x - ray features predicted by the reflection spectra",
    ". the differences mainly lie at energies @xmath52  kev , where the continuum level is raised due to the increase in free - free emission and absorption . as a result",
    ", the ews of many of the emission lines have been substantially decreased .",
    "the expectation is that increasing the density further will continue to raise the continuum level at soft energies , as more line emission is absorbed by the continuum , and decrease the ew of the remaining emission lines . clearly , the soft x - ray emission features are a strong diagnostic for the accretion disc density",
    ". it would be therefore be very interesting to obtain rapid , time - resolved broad - band spectra of x - ray bursts to exploit the information in those spectral features . in the near future",
    "only the xrt onboard the _ swift _ satellite will have these features , plus the necessary rapid response capability . unfortunately",
    ", soft x - ray spectroscopy of burst sources will be challenging .",
    "lmxbs are old systems and many of them lie toward to the galactic center , thus suffering from significant absorption due to neutral hydrogen along the line of sight . however , there are a number of lmxbs which reside in globular clusters that may provide lower extinction columns and allow sensitive soft x - ray observations .",
    "rapid follow - up of x - ray bursts from lmxbs globular clusters therefore provide the best chance of utilizing the full information obtained in the reflection spectra .",

    "<S> the lines slowly vanish as the ionization parameter of the slab is increased , but the free - free continuum remains dominant at energies less than 1  kev . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection spectrum has a quasi - blackbody shape only at energies greater than 3  kev . </S>",
    "<S> if the incident blackbody is added to the reflection spectrum , the fe  k@xmath0  equivalent width varies between 100 and 300  ev depending on the ionization parameter and the temperature , @xmath1 , of the blackbody . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent width is correlated with @xmath1 , and therefore we predict a strong fe  k@xmath0  line when an x - ray burst is at its brightest ( if iron is not too ionized or the reflection amplitude too small ) . extending the study of reflection features in the spectra of superbursts to lower energies would provide further constraints on the accretion flow . if the fe  k@xmath0  line or other features are relativistically broadened then they can determine the system inclination angle ( which leads to the neutron star mass ) , and , if the mass is known , a lower - limit to the mass / radius ratio of the star .    </S>",
