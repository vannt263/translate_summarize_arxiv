    "it is inherent to the lattice approach to quantum field theory , that one has to extrapolate from finite lattices , finite statistics and non - critical coupling parameters to infinite lattices , infinite statistics and critical points . since the result supposedly is a non - trivial , non - perturbatively defined quantum field theory , this process is plagued by uncertainties .",
    "a typical example of such a situation , where all these aspects combine , is the study of the thermal transition in qcd for small quark masses .",
    "one is interested in the continuum limit ( gauge coupling @xmath1 ) , small or vanishing fermion masses ( @xmath2 ) , close to critical temperature ( @xmath3 ) in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath4 )  a formidable problem .",
    "the extrapolations are always based on assumptions on the asymptotic behavior .",
    "well known examples are scaling functions based on renormalization group and chiral perturbation theory  an expansion around a ground state with goldstone bosons . here",
    "we will examine another such approach , which should allow the extrapolation to infinite volume and vanishing fermion mass : chiral random matrix theory ( chrmt ) .",
    "rmt attempts to identify universal features of ensembles of ( random ) matrices with common symmetry properties . its chiral version , if successful , allows to separate two aspects of a theory like qcd : the general universal properties shared with other theories from the model - specific `` dynamical '' content of the theory .",
    "microscopic eigenvalue distribution shapes are an example for the first aspect , expectation values of the fermion condensate for the second .",
    "the limitations for validity of the chrmtconsiderations ( for a given @xmath5 in the phase of broken chiral symmetry ) are set by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the linear size of the system and @xmath8 is the mass of the lightest ( pseudo-)goldstone boson .",
    "the second restriction imposes that the pion does not fit into the space - time volume and it therefore appears to be unphysical .",
    "however , various correlators in the dirac operator spectrum can be computed precisely in this limit .    chrmthas been proven to give exact analytical predictions for the spectrum of the dirac operator in the microscopic limit @xcite .",
    "the microscopic scaling region is simply a blowup of the origin in the spectrum . to be specific",
    ", one considers eigenvalues @xmath9 on the scale @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the chiral condensate , related to the spectral density per unit volume @xmath12 via the banks - casher @xcite relation , @xmath13 .",
    "this regime is , by definition , only well defined in the spontaneously broken phase where @xmath14 . in the phase with restored symmetry the scale of interest is set by the density of states in the vicinity of the onset of @xmath12 .    here",
    "we present a study of the microscopic correlators in the spectrum of the staggered dirac operator in su(3 ) gauge theory with dynamical fermions at finite temperature .",
    "specifically we examine the low lying eigenvalue statistics at temperatures below , near , and above the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition .",
    "our analysis is based on the evaluation of the milc collaboration s gauge configurations @xcite .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the new aspects connected to rmt ideas for the spectral correlators of the dirac operator .",
    "in particular for @xmath15 we study the singularity at the inner endpoint of the spectral density .",
    "strictly speaking , in the continuum limit @xmath16 , non - zero temperature is realized for lattices @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in that limit , for vanishing quark mass @xmath20",
    ", one expects a phase transition at @xmath0 . in @xcite",
    "the critical temperature was estimated to lie between 143 and 154 mev .",
    "for @xmath21 chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously , with massless pseudoscalars and @xmath22 ; above @xmath0 we expect restoration of this symmetry .",
    "whereas for pure yang - mills theory the deconfinement transition is associated with a breaking of the center - symmetry with the polyakov loop as order parameter , this symmetry is explicitly broken by the fermion action .",
    "nevertheless , remnants of the original breaking feature of the polyakov loop persist even for small fermion masses .",
    "the nature of the chiral phase transition depends on the number of flavors @xmath23 .",
    "an argument based on a 3d @xmath24-models analysis @xcite predicts a first order phase transition for @xmath25 . for @xmath26",
    "one expects a second order phase transition with @xmath27 scaling behavior . however , even first order behavior may be arguable @xcite . for staggered fermions at non - vanishing lattice spacing the correct counting of flavors",
    "is unclear since flavor symmetry is restored only in the continuum limit .",
    "staggered fermions ( as simulated by milc with the hybrid r - algorithm @xcite ) correspond to the case @xmath26 in the continuum limit . on coarse lattices",
    "the so defined fermions should show at least @xmath28 scaling behavior . for a discussion of the various scenarios cf .",
    "@xcite .    it is unclear whether the phase transition at @xmath0 extends towards @xmath29 or whether , when moving from lower to higher temperature , one just observes crossover - like behavior .",
    "some evidence points towards this second scenario @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we denote the crossover ( phase transition ) position by @xmath30 or simply @xmath0 .",
    "according to the nature of the elements in the random matrix , chrmtappears in three universality classes . in this paper",
    "we consider the su(3 ) gauge theory with quarks in the fundamental representation , which belongs to the universality class of the chiral unitary ensemble ( chue ) .",
    "the partition function under study is @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a @xmath33 block hermitian matrix ( the elements of @xmath34 being random complex numbers ) , and @xmath5 is a deterministic , i.e. not - random , off - diagonal block matrix @xmath35 here d@xmath32 denotes the haar measure , @xmath36 is an analytic function .    the predictions from chrmtconcern the correlations between the eigenvalues @xmath9 of @xmath37 on the scale of individual eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit @xmath38 .",
    "the matrix @xmath39 is the analogue of the massless dirac operator in qcd .",
    "the chiral phase transition within chrmtis identified through the value of the spectral density of the eigenvalues of @xmath39 near zero , i.e. using the banks - casher relation .",
    "modeling the chiral phase transition in chrmtamounts to driving a depletion of eigenvalues of @xmath39 near the origin by means of some temperature parameter .",
    "two separate approaches have been examined in the literature .",
    "first , the unitary invariant chrmt@xcite , corresponding to ( [ z ] ) with @xmath40 , in which the chiral phase transition is driven by tuning @xmath41 .",
    "second , the non - unitary invariant chrmt@xcite , corresponding to ( [ z ] ) with @xmath42 , where the deterministic block matrix @xmath5 mimics the effect of the temperature . in this paper",
    "we do not need to distinguish between the two approaches as they are consistent for the quantities measured here .",
    "below @xmath0 , i.e. when @xmath14 , chrmtpredicts @xcite the probability distribution for the smallest eigenvalue ( for the trivial topological sector ) @xmath43 with @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spectral density at the origin for the _ massless _ situation ( i.e. when @xmath46 in ( [ z ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath47 denotes the @xmath48th modified bessel function .",
    "this result is universal in the chrmtcontext , that is , the analytic form of @xmath49 does not change under deformations of @xmath41 provided that @xmath14 . after the identification @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the physical volume in lattice units ) , ( [ pmin ] ) allows to extract @xmath52 ( the fermion condensate in the chiral limit ) from finite - volume dirac spectra",
    "of course , in this the mild condition ( [ qcdrange ] ) must be satisfied .    above @xmath0 , when there is a finite gap in the spectral density , the repulsion between the eigenvalue pair @xmath53 becomes negligible ; chrmthence predicts a _ soft _ inner edge , known as the airy - solution @xcite .    at @xmath0",
    " signaled in chrmtby a power - like behavior of the spectral density at small @xmath9  @xmath54 , the prediction from chrmtis not unique .",
    "it turns out that the spectral correlators depend on the value of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue is a spectral one - point correlation function and is quite sensitive to statistical fluctuations ( see below ) . as an additional measure we also study a two - point correlator : the level spacing distribution @xmath56 .",
    "note that the level spacings , @xmath57 , are determined in the unfolded spectrum @xmath58 .",
    "unfolding separates the fluctuation properties of the spectrum from the supposedly smooth background behavior .",
    "the unfolded variable is defined in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum and the local average spectral density by @xmath59 the rmt prediction for the level spacing distribution is well approximated by the unitary wigner surmise @xmath60 the level spacing distribution is not expected to be affected by temperature and masses in chrmt , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "chrmtmakes predictions for average spectral correlators in sectors with definite topological charge @xmath61 , i.e. derived assuming exact zero modes ( these are not included in the predicted distributions ; cf .",
    "@xcite for the result of the weighted summation of all topological sectors ) . for ginsparg - wilson fermions @xcite , which realize chiral symmetry on the lattice , one may identify exact zero modes as resulting from topological excitations according to the atiyah - singer index theorem ( for wilson fermions one can hypothesize that zero modes are replaced by real modes ) .",
    "this is not the case for staggered fermions , where exact zero modes are absent away from the continuum limit @xcite and even gauge configurations with non - vanishing topological charge do not give zero eigenvalues .",
    "exact zero modes are here replaced by `` almost '' zero modes which accumulate to the origin in the continuum limit . in the strong coupling region",
    "the microscopic staggered dirac spectra summed over all topological sectors show @xcite good agreement with the analytical prediction for the topologically neutral , @xmath62 , sector from chrmt .",
    "however , approaching weaker coupling observations contradicting this scenario have been found in a two - dimensional context @xcite .    before turning to the numerical studies ,",
    "let us comment on the validity of the chrmtpredictions .",
    "the condition for application of chrmtin lattice analyses is well established when @xmath63 : the range in the unfolded spectrum over which the chrmtcorrelations dominate is @xmath64 @xcite , where @xmath65 is the pion decay constant .",
    "an equivalent statement for @xmath66 is not known and no stringent tests of the low - lying eigenvalue statistics have been carried out so far .",
    "let us emphasize that even though the larger part of the studies of chrmthave been focused on the situation where @xmath14 , there is nothing wrong from first principles in using chrmtwhen @xmath67 .",
    "by courtesy of the milc collaboration @xcite there are sets of gauge configurations @xcite available to the lattice community .",
    "these were generated with two species of dynamical staggered fermions , at various lattice sizes , temperatures , values of the gauge coupling and small values of the bare fermion mass . in table",
    "[ tabconf ] the samples used in the present study are listed . for further details on the method of determination of the gauge configurations and the physical parameters",
    "we refer to @xcite .    .",
    "summary of the milc configurations used in our analysis ( for ft01 we only considered a subset of the total of 149 configurations available ) .",
    "the suggestions in the rightmost column are based on milc s results .",
    "the transition is near @xmath68=5.26 for @xmath69 and @xmath68=5.725 for @xmath70 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : fit ]    in order to further investigate this feature , we studied ( for the set with @xmath71 ) the influence of the configurations where the eigenvectors @xmath72 of the lowest eigenvalues exhibit a large contribution to the total chirality , i.e. @xmath73 . according to the index theorem , these configurations with large chirality , which make up roughly one half of the ensemble , tend to carry non - vanishing topological charge and therefore zero modes .",
    "indeed we find that a substantial part ( 75% ) of the first peak may be explained from these contributions .",
    "these findings suggest that indeed topological modes are responsible for a low - lying peak in the distributions .",
    "below @xmath0 all topological sectors are present and the low - lying eigenvalues have comparable magnitudes ( their average position being roughly proportional to @xmath61 ) .",
    "when the temperature approaches @xmath0 the theoretical expectation is that the topological fluctuations begin to be suppressed , although still present in the ensemble , quasi superimposed on the background distribution , which starts to broaden significantly with increasing temperature . sufficiently far above @xmath0 only the topologically trivial sector survives and there may be no small eigenvalues at all .",
    "this is indeed what we actually observe for the lattice @xmath74 .    in a recent study of quenched configurations @xcite",
    "there have been indications for a dilute gas of instanton  anti - instanton pairs producing a poissonian distribution of small eigenvalues above @xmath0 .",
    "these may be suppressed or absent when considering dynamical fermions . in our context",
    "this seems to be the case for the finest lattices ( @xmath75 with @xmath76 ) at our disposal .",
    "[ secondevs ] gives the histograms for the 2nd smallest eigenvalues .",
    "again we notice a dramatic change of the distribution shape around @xmath30 .",
    "we interpret the sudden flatness of the distribution of the smallest eigenvalues as being ( i ) due to the vanishing spectral density and ( ii ) due to increasing statistical fluctuations near the chiral phase transition .",
    "the latter effect is not reproduced in chrmtsince this is a zero dimensional and non - dynamical theory .",
    "furthermore , the mutual overlap of @xmath77 and @xmath78 increases for @xmath79 .",
    "this is also inconsistent with chrmt . in order to study this effect",
    "further we now turn to the level spacing distributions .",
    "another observable with definite predictions from rmt ( cf .",
    "[ secrmt ] ) is the distribution of level spacings .",
    "the advantage here is , that the level spacing should not be influenced by possible distortions of the smallest eigenvalues due to the unknown topological charge of the configurations ( if the smallest eigenvalues are removed from the data ) .",
    "the studies of the level spacing statistics in lattice data so far have shown a uniform picture consistent with the rmt prediction ( [ wue ] ) .",
    "the agreement extends on both sides of the confinement - deconfinement phase transition @xcite .",
    "however , to the authors knowledge there is no analytical prediction from chrmtfor the level spacing distribution when focusing on the soft edge or at @xmath0 .",
    "so one might worry that the standard prediction , eq .",
    "( [ wue ] ) , is not appropriate when @xmath67 . within the t - model of @xcite for @xmath80 and @xmath81 ,",
    "we have performed a numerical high statistics simulation to eliminate such doubt , and we there confirmed the distribution ( [ wue ] ) .",
    "( the t - model is defined by ( [ z ] ) with @xmath42 and @xmath82 in ( [ tmodel ] ) chosen proportional to the unit matrix . )",
    "usually it is possible to get high statistics on the level spacing distributions since each configuration provides a large number of eigenvalue spacings .",
    "however , already the lowest 10 ( or 8) eigenvalues allow for a crude estimate of the distribution shape .",
    "recall that the level spacing distribution is measured in the unfolded spectrum , see ( [ defunf ] ) .",
    "here we use the average spacings @xmath83 between contiguous eigenvalues to define the unfolded level spacings @xmath84    in fig .",
    "[ levelspc ] we compare the data with the parameter - free theoretical expectation .",
    "whereas below and above @xmath0 we find reasonable agreement with the theoretical expectation , there are clear discrepancies near @xmath0 .",
    "we observe unexpected high histogram entries .",
    "since the average value by definition is 1 this then leads to a shift of the central peak to the left .    in order to further check our unfolding procedure ,",
    "we also considered other approaches , e.g. using a average density as in ( [ defunf ] ) by smoothing our distribution in various ways .",
    "we furthermore tried to discard the higher lying eigenvalues , e.g. using only the lowest 5 level spacings or introducing a cutoff near the peak of the distributions in fig .",
    "[ firstevs ] . in all those checks we found essentially the same behavior with discrepancies near @xmath0 .    in conclusion of this section",
    ", we observe at @xmath85 a breakdown of the otherwise universal microscopic spectral correlations .",
    "the dynamics of qcd plays an essential rle in the phase transition . a rmt model where such dynamics is not there fails to account for the increased fluctuations in the eigenvalue level spacings .",
    "we now turn to the results for @xmath15 . in our results for @xmath75 at @xmath76 ( fig .",
    "[ all - dist](c ) ) a gap in the spectral distributions is obvious .",
    "however even at @xmath86 we may speculate , that a clear signal of a gap is only prevented by the ( topological ) quasi - zero modes responsible for the small bump at small eigenvalues .",
    "recall , that chrmt@xcite predicts the presence of a gap in the spectral density @xmath12 of the dirac operator centered around @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , the inner edge of this gap is predicted to show a singularity , at a point @xmath88 , in the macroscopic spectral density @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a known constant .",
    "the constant @xmath91 takes the value @xmath92 in the generic chrmt , i. e. without fine - tuning the matrix potential in ( [ z ] ) ( which would be necessary in order to obtain higher values of @xmath91 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a square - root - like eigenvalue density near @xmath88 .",
    "one concern here is to measure @xmath91 . with the limited amount of data available",
    "it is not possible to do this based on the spectral density only .",
    "instead we propose to study the average distance between the smallest and the sequel eigenvalues @xmath93 ; the extraction of @xmath91 is carried out by noting the following scaling relation in the index @xmath94 , ordering by size the eigenvalues which follow the smallest , @xmath95 this proportionality follows by integration in ( [ aisingularity ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ and ] we display the seven average distances , @xmath96 , from the ensemble of 146 configurations on a @xmath97 lattice for @xmath98 .",
    "we also exhibit the best fit to ( [ qi ] ) with respect to @xmath91 , giving @xmath99 . also shown",
    "are the corresponding curves for @xmath92 and @xmath100 .",
    "the value @xmath92 is clearly favored .",
    "since the two - point correlations behave as expected from rmt , we now turn to the one - point distribution .",
    "the microscopic behavior of the spectral density in the vicinity of this singularity is universal in the chrmtsense , but depends on the value of @xmath91 @xcite . for @xmath92",
    "the exact analytical prediction for the microscopic spectral density in the vicinity of the inner edge is @xcite @xmath101 here the origin has been moved to the inner spectral endpoint @xmath88 by means of the rescaled eigenvalue @xmath102 , which is defined through @xmath103 \\ .\\ ] ]    the consistency with the prediction ( [ qi ] ) for @xmath92 and the approximate validity of chrmtcorrelations in the level spacing statistics above @xmath0 suggest that the airy - density ( [ aidens ] ) corresponding to the value @xmath92 should fit the spectral density .",
    "if it does , then we can extract the inner - endpoint @xmath88 of the spectrum in the thermodynamic limit , by fitting @xmath104 with respect to @xmath88 to the lowest part of the spectral density , see fig .",
    "[ airyfig ] .",
    "this fit does not convincingly confirm airy density .",
    "however , the statistical fluctuations at this @xmath68-value affect the _ one - point distribution _ substantially and prevent a decisive comparison .",
    "we have examined the manifestations of the chiral phase transition in the microscopic spectral correlators for the dirac operator . for the level spacing distribution",
    ", we find agreement with rmtbelow and above @xmath0 . below @xmath0",
    "the chrmtdistributions allow us to determine condensate values with implicit consideration of lattice volume and quark mass dependence .",
    "this could in principle serve to improve the scaling analysis of the condensate near the chiral transition .    near @xmath0 , however , the microscopic spectral statistics differs from the chrmtprediction . by measuring the monte carlo time evolution of the chiral condensate , aoki et al .",
    "@xcite have shown , that there are mixed phase signals , which , however , vanish towards larger volumes .",
    "the existence of a mixed phase would offer an explanation for the observed deviations from chrmtnear @xmath0 . in that case",
    "the level spacing distribution near @xmath0 would be a mixture of those from the two phases .",
    "such a mixture would lead to large spacings : the spacings are unfolded according to the average spacings of the total ensemble and not according to that of the separate phases .",
    "the observed discrepancy from the rmt level spacing statistics may also be interpreted as an inclination towards poissonian statistics ; distribution shapes interpolating between wigner and poissonian statistics have been suggested by brody @xcite .    as may be seen from the @xmath75 ensembles at @xmath86 and @xmath105",
    ", a gap develops the spectral density for @xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed suppression of topological fluctuations in the latter ensemble @xcite . for the @xmath76 ensemble",
    "we have measured the critical exponent characterizing the steepness of the density at the inner edge .",
    "the value is found to be compatible with 1/2 .",
    "this is exactly as predicted by chrmtwhere the chiral phase transition is manifested by the crossover from the bessel hard edge to the airy soft edge .",
    "the indications of the bessel to airy scenario are suggestive but simulations with extended statistics are needed in order to quantify the observation .",
    "however , even with low statistics the @xmath68-dependence of the distance between e.g. 8th and 1st eigenvalue provides an excellent means to identify the change of the phase .    at low @xmath68 , on coarse lattices ,",
    "staggered fermions appear to be blind with regard to the topological charge of the gauge configurations , and the smallest eigenvalue distribution agrees with the chrmtdistribution for the @xmath62 sector . as the lattice becomes finer , topology becomes more relevant .",
    "although this is maybe `` good '' for the continuum limit of staggered fermions , it affects unfavorably the agreement with chrmtsince the want - to - be - zero modes and the non - zero modes have similar eigenvalues , and begin to separate only when the non - zero modes are pushed to larger values when increasing the temperature .",
    "we want to thank the milc collaboration for making available the gauge configurations , that we used in our analysis .",
    "special thanks go to jim hetrick and doug toussaint for their help in accessing those and for the support in making additional ensembles public .",
