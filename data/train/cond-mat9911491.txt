    "in recent years the investigation of two - dimensional frustrated heisenberg model is of great interest .",
    "this is mainly caused by studies of magnetic properties of superconducting cuprates .",
    "the so called @xmath1 model was studied by different methods in the case of completely antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath2 [ 1 - 8 ] .",
    "an existence of disordered phases at the @xmath3 and nontrivial ground states in this papers is generally assumed .",
    "the model with ferromagnetic interactions of nearest neighbors and antiferromagnetic interactions of next nearest neighbor spins has been investigated much less .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model has a form : @xmath4 where vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 connects nearest sites and nearest sites along the diagonal line respectively , @xmath7 - a site number and @xmath8 .",
    "the model ( 1 ) is a special case of the @xmath1 model with @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 - is the exchange integral of the next nearest neighbors along x and y axes ) .",
    "this model is the simplest example of the 2d frustrated system .",
    "the ground state of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is ferromagnetic at small @xmath12 and the energy @xmath13 .",
    "but this state becomes unstable at some critical point @xmath14 . in the classical approximation",
    "@xmath15 is equal to @xmath16 and the ground state at @xmath17 corresponds to two independent sublattices with neel order .",
    "however , quantum fluctuations can change this situation .",
    "this question will be discussed in this paper .",
    "to clarify the situation let us compare the 2d model ( 1 ) with its 1d version which has been studied in detail previously [ 9 - 11 ] .",
    "in the 1d model the transition from the ferromagnetic ground state to the spiral one takes place at @xmath18 . in a recent work by two of present authors",
    "[ 11 ] the character of this transition has been investigated by the perturbation theory in the small parameter @xmath19 and the classical state has been used as zeroth - order approximation .",
    "the ground state in all cases turned out to be either with @xmath20 or with @xmath21 , and the transition from the ferromagnetic state to the state with @xmath20 occurs by passing the states with intermediate spins .",
    "quantum fluctuations do not change the critical point @xmath15 , which coincides with its classical value .",
    "( 11,7 )    this method has been applied also to the study of the 2d model with @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the vicinity of the phase boundary @xmath24 ( fig.1 ) , which determines the region of stability of the ferromagnetic state in the classical approximation . at @xmath25",
    "the situation is similar to the 1d case [ 12 ] .",
    "however , at @xmath26 the second order of the perturbation theory in the small parameter describing a deviation from the phase boundary diverges .",
    "it proves that quantum fluctuations change the classical phase diagram itself .",
    "the energies of one- and two - magnon states are shown in fig.2 as functions of the parameter @xmath12 for model ( 1 ) ( @xmath27 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "the critical values @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the instability of the ferromagnetic state with respect to a creation of one and two magnons are equal to @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively ( two - magnon state energy was found by the numerical solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation ) . the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath29 shows that the classical approach is inapplicable to the study of the stability of the ferromagnetic state . in this respect",
    "the situation is essentially different from those in the 1d or in the 2d cases at @xmath25 , when the critical point @xmath15 is independent on the number of magnons and coincides with its classical value .",
    "it is natural to assume , that the critical value @xmath32 for model ( 1 ) is less than @xmath29 , and the critical value @xmath33 corresponding to the state with @xmath20 is a true point of the phase transition .",
    "so , the classical approximation has proved to be unsuitable for the study of the phase transition in the model ( 1 ) and for the determination of the critical value @xmath15 and , therefore , another approach is needed .",
    "( 11,7 )    one can obtain a crude estimate of the energy and the critical point @xmath33 by using a product of the ground state wave functions of two independent antiferromagnetic sublattices as a variational wave function ( vwf ) .",
    "this vwf gives for the critical point @xmath33 a value : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the ground state energy per site of the 2d antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , and we use the most accurate numerical estimations of @xmath36 [ 13,14 ] .",
    "of course , this approach is too poor , and the obtained value @xmath33 is greater than @xmath29 .    in the present work we propose a new type of vwf , which allows us to get more accurate estimations of @xmath15 and to study the character of the phase transition .",
    "this approach is based on a boson representation of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) which is different from the holstein - primakoff one .",
    "in contrast with the spin wave theory ( swt )  the proposed method is variational .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate the method by the application it to the 2d heisenberg antiferromagnetic model . in section 3",
    "the stability of the ferromagnetic phase of the frustrated model is studied and the data are discussed .",
    "to illustrate the main features of our approach , let us consider the 2d haf model : @xmath37 where @xmath7 is a site number of the 2d lattice and a vector @xmath5 connects nearest sites .",
    "it is convenient to rotate the local coordinate system of one of sublattices by the angle @xmath38 in xz plane : @xmath39    the transformation from spin - operators to bose - ones is defined by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 are bose - operators , @xmath42 , and the operator function @xmath43 is : @xmath44    it is evident that this transformation preserves all commutation relations for the spin operators .",
    "the states with different numbers of bosons on each site are effectively separated into equivalent unconnected pairs : @xmath45    as a result of the transformation ( 5 ) the hamiltonian ( 4 ) takes the form : @xmath46    this hamiltonian , as well as the original one , can not be solved exactly . as a trial wave function for hamiltonian ( 8)",
    "we choose : @xmath47 where the function @xmath48 will be found by the minimization of the total energy .",
    "the vacuum state in eq.(9 ) corresponds to the state of the hamiltonian ( 4 ) with all spins pointing down ( or corresponds to a ",
    "chess  arrangement of spins for the hamiltonian ( 3 ) ) .    to calculate the ground state energy we need to calculate expectation values of all terms in the hamiltonian ( 8) with respect to vwf ( 9 ) .",
    "at first we calculate the terms corresponding to the spin interactions along the horizontal line ( x axe ) .",
    "owing to the translational symmetry of vwf ( 9 ) , all of these terms give equal contributions to the energy , and , therefore , it is sufficient to calculate terms corresponding to the interaction @xmath49 in the original hamiltonian ( 3 ) , where 1 and 2 are nearest neighbors along the horizontal line .    at first",
    "we represent all factors @xmath50 in the hamiltonian ( 8) in the form : @xmath51    then the expectation value of the second term of the hamiltonian ( 8) , corresponding to the term @xmath52 in the hamiltonian ( 4 ) , takes the form : @xmath53   \\label{11}\\ ] ]    thus , we need to calculate expectation values of the type : @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be : @xmath58    in order to decompose the boson quadratic form in eq.(9 ) we use the hubbard - stratanovich transformation .",
    "now , the vwf ( 9 ) takes the form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a number of lattice sites .",
    "now we can calculate the expectation values ( 12,13 ) : @xmath61 @xmath62 where we use the notations : @xmath63 @xmath64    using the identity : @xmath65 _ { p_3=0}\\ ] ] eqs.(16,17 ) can be written as : @xmath66 @xmath67 _ { p_3=0 } , \\label{21}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69    it is convenient to use hubbard - stratanovich transformation for ( 23 ) : @xmath70 where @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73    so , there are only linear terms on @xmath74 and @xmath75 in exponent of eq.(25 ) , and , therefore , we can compute the expectation value @xmath76 by diagonalizing @xmath77 .",

    "can be written as : @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98    we note , that the expectation value @xmath99 can be obtained from eq.(30 ) by setting @xmath100 and @xmath101 . hence , we obtain : @xmath102    the contribution to the energy of the terms corresponding to nearest neighbors along the horizontal line in the hamiltonian ( 8) is : @xmath103    one can verify by rotating the local coordinate systems and repeating the calculations ( 5 - 30 ) for the transformed hamiltonian , that the values @xmath104 and @xmath105 correspond to expectation values : @xmath106    the calculation of the expectation values of the terms of the hamiltonian ( 8) corresponding to the nearest neighbor interactions along the vertical line ( y axe ) @xmath107 can be carried out in the analogy with ( 9 - 30 ) . in this case",
    ", we must only substitute the functions @xmath108 for @xmath109 into eqs.(36 - 38 ) .",
    "then we obtain the contribution to energy of the vertical neighbor terms : @xmath110    the total energy of hamiltonian ( 8) can be written as : @xmath111    thus , we find energy as a function of parameters @xmath112 .",
    "these parameters are functions of @xmath113 [ or of @xmath114 in vwf ( 9 ) ] .",
    "now we need to minimize the energy with respect to @xmath115 : @xmath116 where @xmath117    we can define the functional form of @xmath115 from eq.(43 ) : @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 @xmath121 are variational parameters .",
    "thus , we reduce the problem of the energy minimization over the variational function @xmath115 to the energy minimization with respect to five variational parameters @xmath120 . this procedure has been performed numerically .",
    "it gives the final result for 2d haf : @xmath122    besides , both terms in eq.(42 ) give equal contributions to the energy : @xmath123    obtained ground state energy for the 2d haf ( 3 ) is 4 - 4,5% higher than the most accurate results obtained by various numerical techniques [ 13,14 ] and is in a good agreement with energies obtained by different vwf methods [ 15 - 17 ] .",
    "now we apply the proposed approach to the frustrated model ( 1 ) .",
    "the ground state of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is ferromagnetic at small @xmath12 . in the classical approximation two - sublattice neel state",
    "is realized at @xmath124 .",
    "the energy of this state is : @xmath125    a spiral state ( the incommensurate phase with the momentum @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) has higher energy at @xmath124 : @xmath128 although it tends to zero at @xmath129 as well .",
    "energies of other phases are considerably higher . the energy of the dimer phase , for example , equals to @xmath130 at @xmath131 .",
    "hence , it is natural to consider neel two - sublattice and the spiral states as main candidates for the ground state at @xmath17 .",
    "we will calculate quantum corrections to the classical energy for these states using the vwf ( 9 ) . before that",
    ", we make the following remark .",
    "the vwf ( 9 ) has no rotational symmetry ( it is not the eigenfunction of @xmath132 ) , and , therefore , the ground state energy calculated in this approximation depends on the choice of the local coordinate system for the hamiltonian ( 1 ) . in other words , if we rotate spin operators @xmath133 and perform a transformation to bose - operators according to eq.(5 ) , then , generally speaking , obtained energies will be different in spite of the equivalence of the hamiltonians @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "hence , parameters of the rotation can be considered as variational ones .    for",
    "the consideration of the two - sublattice neel phase let us rotate the coordinate system so that there are the angle @xmath38 in @xmath136 plane between two nearest neighbors on each sublattice ( as in the 2d  haf case ) and the angle @xmath137 between sublattices in @xmath136 plane .",
    "we will keep the angle @xmath138 as a variational parameter ( we note , that the energy is infinitely degenerated with respect to @xmath139 in the classical approximation ) . in this case , the hamiltonian ( 1 ) takes the form : @xmath140 \\nonumber \\\\   & + & j \\sum_{\\bf",

    "the vwf ( 9 ) contains only terms that involve even numbers of boson operators and , therefore , all expectation values such as @xmath146 in ( 49 ) are equal to zero : @xmath147    in this case there are nine variational parameters in eq.(45 ) : @xmath148    ( 11,8 )    the critical value @xmath15 is defined by the condition that the ground state energy is negative for @xmath17 . to find @xmath15 we minimize the following ratio : @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the contributions to the energy from the first and the second terms in the hamiltonian ( 49 ) : @xmath152    the dependence of @xmath15 on @xmath137 obtained by a minimization with respect to parameters @xmath120 is shown on fig.3 .",
    "as it can be seen from fig.3 , the minima of @xmath15 are reached at @xmath153 or @xmath154 .",
    "the corresponding states belong to the so called collinear phase . at @xmath155",
    "we have : @xmath156    the calculation of the energy with use of the vwf ( 9 )  for the spiral phase can be carried out in a similar way .",
    "it turns out that quantum fluctuations do not shift the transition point and change the coefficient in the quadratic dependence in ( 48 ) only .",
    "the dependences of the energies of the collinear and spiral states are shown on fig.4 .",
    "for comparison , we show the spin wave theory results as well .",
    "the swt energy is not a variational one and is defined up to @xmath157 , where the sublattice magnetization vanishes in the swt approximation .",
    "( 11,8 )    thus , the singlet collinear phase is the ground state of the model ( 1 ) for @xmath158 .",
    "a characteristic feature of the considered model ( 1 ) is the fact , that the critical value @xmath15 , ( the point of the instability of the ferromagnetic state ) , depends on @xmath159 and @xmath160 . in this respect",
    "this model differs from the 1d case where @xmath15 does not depend on @xmath159 .",
    "such 1d behaviour takes place also in a more general 2d @xmath161 model in the vicinity of the classical phase boundary and at @xmath25 . in this case ,",
    "quantum effects do not change the classical boundary of the instability of the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the region near the boundary can be considered in the framework of the perturbation theory , and the transition from the ferromagnetic state to the spiral one occurs in this case .",
    "the character of the transition changes at @xmath162 , and the critical parameter @xmath15 , corresponding to @xmath163 , depends on @xmath159 . in this case the transition from the ferromagnetic to the collinear state is realized .",

    ", we have studied the transition from the ferromagnetic to the singlet state in the 2d frustrated spin model .",
    "the transition region is characterized by strong quantum fluctuations and can not be described by the classical approximation . to study the behaviour of the system close to the ferromagnetic boundary we have proposed new approach based on the bozonization of the spin operators .",
