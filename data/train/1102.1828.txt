    "nano - electromechanical systems  @xcite ( nems ) represent an intriguing class of devices composed of a nano - mechanical resonator coupled to an electronic nanodevice .",
    "several examples of nems have been realized , ranging from single oscillating molecules ,  @xcite to suspended carbon nanotubes  @xcite and suspended nano - cantilevers or nano - beams .",
    "@xcite    in all these devices , the coupling between mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom gives rise to peculiar transport phenomena like franck - condon blockade ,  @xcite negative differential conductance  @xcite and remarkable noise characteristics .",
    "@xcite along with their outstanding electronic properties , also mechanical ones are of extreme interest . indeed , owing to the extreme sensitivity of the vibrating part to the spatial motion ,",
    "nems have been proposed as novel detectors in scanning microscopes  @xcite or as ultra - sensitive nano - scales , being able to detect the mass of even few molecules adhering to them .",
    "@xcite in order to successfully employ a nems as a precision position detector it is important to reduce its thermal fluctuations , eventually attaining the ultimate goal of cooling it down to its quantum ground state .",
    "@xcite also , ultra - sensitive nems position detectors based on peculiar quantum states such as position - squeezed states  @xcite have been proposed and experimentally realized .",
    "@xcite    a great variety of nems setups have been investigated theoretically .",
    "typically , the electronic part is composed of a semiconducting ,  @xcite normal  @xcite or superconducting  @xcite single quantum dot .",
    "@xcite double - dot setups have been studied as well .",
    "@xcite different models for the coupling between electrons and vibrons have been considered , ranging from the simple anderson - holstein ( ah ) model  @xcite to microscopic models tailored for specific systems , such as suspended carbon nanotubes .",
    "@xcite also the influence of external dissipative baths  @xcite or radiation fields  @xcite has been analyzed . in the most complex configurations , interesting physical effects have been predicted .",
    "for instance , for a nano - mechanical resonator coupled to a microwave cavity ,  @xcite to field driven quantum dot  @xcite or in configurations with double quantum dots ,  @xcite phonon cooling has been found . with radio frequency quantum dots  @xcite and a electromagnetic cavity  @xcite squeezing of the vibron position and momentum quadratures has been theoretically predicted .",
    "+ even the simple ah model for a single electronic level coupled to an undamped vibrational mode exhibits a rich physics , part of which is still unexplored .",
    "roughly speaking , two regimes have been considered so far , according to the ratio @xmath2 between the vibron frequency , @xmath3 , and the average dot - leads electron tunneling rate , @xmath4 .    for _ fast _ vibrations , @xmath5 , every electron tunneling event occurs over many oscillator periods .",
    "then the electrons are not sensitive to the position of the oscillator , but only to its energy .",
    "@xcite consequently , the oscillator density matrix becomes close to diagonal in the basis of the energy eigenstates .",
    "@xcite many groups focused their attention on this regime , employing rate equations to study transport phenomena as the franck - condon blockade , super - poissonian shot noise  @xcite and even peculiar effects such as sub - poissonian out of equilibrium vibron distributions .",
    "@xcite    in the opposite regime of _ slow _ vibrations @xmath6 , electrons are extremely sensitive to the position of the oscillator , which can be treated in a _ semi - classical _ approximation .",
    "@xcite indeed , mozyrsky _ et al .",
    "_ have shown  @xcite that it is the onset of a semi - classical langevin dynamics . in this regime",
    "the electronic properties of the system have been especially investigated , in particular the current and shot noise  @xcite in both limits of weak  @xcite and strong electron - vibron coupling .",
    "@xcite in the latter case , bi - stability and switching have been addressed .",
    "@xcite recently , the classical phase space of the vibron has also been studied .",
    "@xcite + less attention has been devoted so far to the _ coherent _ regime , where the _ off - diagonal _ elements of the system density matrix in the energy representation play a relevant role . in this regime , which starts around @xmath7 ( for a more precise discussion , see sec .",
    "[ sec : regimes ] ) , the competition between the vibron and the electron time scales gives rise to a tough theoretical problem .",
    "most of the results obtained so far , concerning bi - stability and phase space analysis , have been obtained stretching somehow the validity range of semi - classical approaches ,  @xcite in the limit of very low temperatures , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath11 the environment temperature .",
    "the interplay of electron and vibron time scales is expected to strongly influence the dynamics of the vibron .",
    "for instance , for a nems based on a metallic dot in the weak coupling regime , the damping effect of tunneling electrons on the vibron dynamics is maximal when @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite similar mechanisms could play a role also in the simpler model of a single level quantum dot .",
    "+ motivated by these considerations , in this article we investigate the vibronic properties in the _ coherent _ regime @xmath7 . here ,",
    "because of the off - diagonal structure of the system density matrix , a simple rate equation is no longer justified .",
    "@xcite we derive a _ generalized master equation _",
    "@xcite in the sequential tunneling regime , in which all off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix in the energy eigenbasis are retained . in the limit of high temperatures considered here , @xmath13 , a fairly large number of basis states have to be included .",
    "this fact leads to a serious numerical challenge .",
    "our calculation extends up to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "we remark that , as a difference with previous studies ,  @xcite our approach is not restricted to small electron - vibron coupling .",
    "+ here is a summary of our findings . with the exception of a region @xmath16 , in the stationary regime",
    "the vibron state can be approximately described in terms of an _ effective thermal distribution_. in the coherent regime , the effective temperature is _ lower _ than the environmental temperature . here , the role of coherences is crucial despite subtle .",
    "non - vanishing off - diagonal elements of the vibron density matrix in the eigenbasis , despite being very small compared with diagonal elements , originate the peculiar effective thermal re - distributions of the vibron occupation probabilities .",
    "+ when @xmath17 , the system exhibits deviations from the above effective thermal state .",
    "the off - diagonal elements are larger , leading to a marked suppression of the vibron fluctuations even below the poissonian value .",
    "the main results of our paper concern the stationary vibron properties in the coherent regime and can be summarized as follows : + ( @xmath0 ) a _ cooling _ of the vibrational mode with respect to the temperature of the electronic environment ; + ( @xmath1 ) a strong _ suppression _ of the vibron fano factor eventually reaching _ sub - poissonian _ values ; + ( @xmath18 ) a reduction of the variances of the vibron position and momentum quadratures .",
    "+ we remark that the reported _ cooling _ phenomenon is a direct consequence of the nems entering the _ coherent _ regime .",
    "it is _ not _ `` induced '' by any external drive or dynamics , like connecting the system to several reservoirs at different temperatures .",
    "@xcite + all the above effects are more pronounced when the electron - vibron coupling strength is increased and none of them comes out treating the system with a simple rate equation involving the diagonal matrix elements only . + the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",

    "<S> we study the properties of a nano - electromechanical system in the coherent regime , where the electronic and vibrational time scales are of the same order . employing a master equation approach </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the stationary reduced density matrix retaining the coherences between vibrational states . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the system parameters , two regimes are identified , characterized by either ( @xmath0 ) an _ effective _ thermal state with a temperature _ lower _ than that of the environment or ( @xmath1 ) strong coherent effects . </S>",
    "<S> a marked cooling of the vibrational degree of freedom is observed with a suppression of the vibron fano factor down to sub - poissonian values and a reduction of the position and momentum quadratures . </S>"
