    "the e3 giant elliptical galaxy ic  1459 ( @xmath13 [ leda , see @xcite ] , @xmath14 mpc [ @xcite ] , @xmath15 [ @xcite ] ) is a member of a loose group consisting mainly of spirals .",
    "it shows clear signs of past interaction , evidenced by stellar `` spiral arms '' detected on deep photographs @xcite and shells at large radii @xcite .",
    "the nuclear region harbors a fast counterrotating stellar component @xcite , which can not be identified as a separate structure in photometric observations .",
    "a blue liner source ( unresolved at hst resolution ) , surrounded by patchy dust absorption and by a gaseous disk , is found at the very center ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter vk00 ) .",
    "vk00 measured the mass of the central supermassive black hole in ic  1459 by analyzing kinematical observations of the nuclear gas disk , obtained with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on board the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "they found a central black hole mass of @xmath16 ( scaling their values to our adopted distance does not influence our conclusions but sets the scale of our models in physical units .",
    "specifically , lengths and masses scale as @xmath17 , while mass - to - light ratios scale as @xmath18 . ] ) .",
    "they also calculated isotropic two - integral axisymmetric dynamical models for ground - based major - axis stellar kinematics , resulting in a significantly larger mass estimate ( @xmath19\\times10 ^ 9 m_\\odot$ ] ) . for comparison , the @xmath5-@xmath11 relation @xcite as given by tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) predicts a black hole mass of @xmath20 .    in this paper",
    ", we construct axisymmetric three - integral models for ic  1459 , using schwarzschild s orbit - superposition method @xcite .",
    "the models are constrained by hst / stis stellar kinematics measurements along the major axis and deep , ground - based spectroscopic observations along five different position angles of the slit .",
    "we show that this data - set allows us to derive information on the nature of the kinematically decoupled component ( kdc ) .",
    "we also re - address the value for the mass of the nuclear bh in this galaxy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the spectroscopic and photometric data in section  2 and present the adopted dynamical model in section  3 .",
    "we discuss our results in section  4 and summarize our conclusions in section  5 .",
    "an hst spectrum of ic  1459 was obtained with stis ( go 7352 , pi : c.m .",
    "carollo ) along the galaxy major axis ( as determined from the hst central isophotes ) , using the g430l grating with the 52@xmath2101 slit . four exposures , slightly shifted in the spatial direction , were obtained for a total of 9812 seconds . the availability of four shifted images allowed for a good removal of the numerous hot and bad pixels , together with cosmic rays , during the coaddition .",
    "the extraction of the stellar kinematics was performed using the pixel - space line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) fitting method of @xcite . in pixel space",
    ", the masking of the prominent gas emission lines during the fit becomes straightforward .",
    "specifically , a k3 iii template star , observed with the 02 stis slit ( go 7388 , pi : d. richstone ; no acceptable stellar template was available for the 01 slit ) , was convolved with a parametrized losvd .",
    "the parameters of the losvd were optimized to the lowest @xmath22 by direct comparison with the observed spectrum .",
    "the galaxy spectrum was rebinned spatially before fitting , to an average s / n@xmath2320 per  .",
    "the error images produced by the stsci pipeline were used to weight the measurements and estimate the errors in the fit .",
    "our idl fitting procedure differs from that of @xcite in the following aspects :    1 .   we used the elegant direct deterministic global optimization algorithm @xcite to perform the @xmath22 optimization for the nonlinear variables @xmath24 and @xmath11 .",
    "this method is _ guaranteed _ to find the global minimum of a ( possibly non - smooth ) nonlinear function inside a finite box , even in the presence of multiple minima .",
    "it can be effectively used in many non - smooth real - world optimization problems with a small number of variables ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we performed a @xmath7 clipped fit to make the fit stable against outliers ( e.g. residual bad pixels , unmasked gas emission lines or template mismatch ) . in practice ,",
    "once the global minimum is found , the galaxy pixels which deviate more than @xmath7 from the best fitting template spectrum are added to the list of masked pixels .",
    "the global optimization is repeated from scratch on the new set of pixels .",
    "this process is iterated until the set of bad pixels does not change anymore .",
    "the errors on the @xmath24 and @xmath11 fitting parameters are determined from the confidence levels for a @xmath22 distribution with two degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting dispersion measurements @xmath26 were corrected by approximating the line - spread - function ( lsf ) by a gaussian , for both the galaxy and the template star .",
    "the template was observed with an effective instrumental dispersion @xmath27  @xcite , while the galaxy was observed with @xmath28 .",
    "the effective instrumental dispersion for the template star is _ smaller _ than that of the galaxy , even though the star was observed with a _",
    "larger _ slit .",
    "the reason for this is that the stis psf falls completely within the 02 slit that was used to observe the template , so that the template lsf is determined essentially by the psf size .",
    "the corrected dispersion @xmath11 was obtained from @xmath29 this correction is of the same order of magnitude as the measurement errors .",
    "no kinematic measurements could be extracted from the two central rows ( 005 from the galaxy center ) of the stis spectrum due to the sharp decrease of the absorption line s / n of the stellar component , caused by the rise of a featureless non - thermal continuum from the central source .",
    "the non - thermal nature of the continuum is indicated by the sharp decrease of the line - strength parameter @xmath30 towards the center .",
    "the measured kinematical profiles are presented in table  [ tab : stis_kin ] and in figure  [ fig : plot_fit_stis ] .",

    "to include a representative set of orbits in the orbit library , we sample them on a grid that covers the full extent of the integral space @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the energy , @xmath58 is the angular momentum along the @xmath59 symmetry axis and @xmath60 is a non - classical integral .",
    "this is achieved by sampling the energy logarithmically in the radius of the circular orbit with the given energy @xmath61 , from 005 to 300 .",

    "inclinations smaller than @xmath71 can be excluded based on the observed axial ratio of ic  1459 , since these values correspond to intrinsic stellar densities that are too flat for an elliptical galaxy .",

    "a smoother and better ( see cretton et al . 1999 ; verolme & de zeeuw 2002 ) solution can be obtained by using regularization .",

    "the regularized solution contains a well - separated group of nearly circular orbits ( @xmath84 ) , which counterrotates with respect to the main galaxy body .",

    "the contribution of the counterrotating component seems to decrease inside @xmath85 .",
    "this is probably not a real effect : there is not enough data inside this radius to constrain the phase space in detail and its appearance is dictated by the smoothness constraint .",

    "this latter model is still able to produce a reasonable fit to all constraints ( see dashed line in figure  [ fig : plot_fit_major ] , [ fig : plot_fit_stis ] ) .",

    "detailed comparison with independent results obtained by gebhardt with a maximum entropy technique ( which starts at the opposite end with a fully smooth distribution function , and then makes it less and less so ) shows that again an amount of smoothing equivalent to our @xmath88 is optimal .    both the best fit values and the details of the internal kinematic structure",
    "are in excellent agreement with our previous results @xcite , which started from a triple power - law parametrization of the stellar surface density instead of the mge expansion and were constrained by ground - based data only .",
    "this comparison shows that the best - fitting parameters do not depend on the details of the adopted stellar density parametrization .",

    "the contribution of a dark halo becomes evident in the observed stellar kinematics only well beyond an effective radius , and hence can be safely ignored ( carollo et al .",
    "1995 ; gerhard et al .",
    "furthermore , we follow standard practice and assume that the stellar mass - to - light ratio does not vary with radius . to determine whether our results depend on this assumption , we also ran models in which @xmath55 follows the change of the @xmath34 color presented in fig .",

    ", the color variation can be translated into a fractional decrease of @xmath55 by @xmath90 per cent per decade in radius , more or less independent of whether the color gradient is due to age or to metallicity variations .",

    "given that the counterrotating component appears so well isolated from the rest of the orbital distribution ( see also figure  [ fig : two_components ] ) , we can make a quantitative estimate of the mass involved .",
    "this is not possible by any other means , due to the fact that the counterrotating component is not apparent from the photometry and does not appear as a double component in the losvd . by summing the solution weights of the orbits that contribute to the counterrotation",
    ", we find that this component carries @xmath3% of the luminous galaxy mass which is @xmath4 ( determined from the gaussian components of table  [ tab : ic1459_mge ] , using the best fitting mass - to - light ratio ) .",

    "we see the nuclear kinematics shows mild tangential anisotropy , which compares well with the corresponding measurements obtained for other galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",

    "@xcite showed that the gauss - hermite ( gh ) parametrization for the losvd , which is used to constrain the kinematics , can produce artificial counterrotations in some special cases .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the model is trying to reproduce a small number of gh moments and not the actual observed losvd and when two functions coincide on a small set of gh moments this does not guarantee that they are the same function .",
    "this phenomenon can be easily recognized after the fit , however , by comparing the losvds predicted by the model and the observed ones . before interpreting the internal dynamics of ic  1459",

    "this @xmath55 equals the one used by vk00 ( taking into account the differences in assumed distance ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gas_modeling ] , we compare the gas velocities with models with several different bh masses . the main result is that none of the models properly fits the gas kinematics .",
    "this is not entirely surprising , given the somewhat disturbed nature of the gas kinematics , as discussed above .",
    "nonetheless , it is striking to note that the model with @xmath103 , the best - fit value inferred from the stellar kinematics , does not even come close to fitting the gas kinematics .",
    "it predicts a central rotation curve gradient that is steeper than what is observed and a a rotation curve amplitude that is larger than what is observed .",
    "the bh mass must be lowered by a factor of @xmath104 to provide a reasonable fit in the central region @xmath105 .",
    "the combined stis , fos and ctio data in this region are best fit by a model with @xmath106 .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the value inferred by vk00 , but is otherwise in reasonable agreement .",
    "a model with no bh predicts a rotation curve gradient that is considerably more shallow than what is observed .",
    "discussions of bh demography have recently focused on the scatter in the relation between bh mass and velocity dispersion .",
    "stellar and gas kinematical bh mass determinations are consistent with the same relation and suggest a scatter of @xmath12 dex ( see e.g. the compilation by * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore surprising that our analyses of the stellar and gaseous kinematics in one and the same galaxy have yielded bh masses that differ by a factor @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath107 dex . to understand the origin of this discrepancy we proceed by discussing the potential systematic problems that may have plagued our analysis .",
    "there are several possible reasons why our analysis of the gas kinematics may have yielded an incorrect estimate of the bh mass .",
    "first , it is possible that the underlying assumptions of our model are correct , but that we have used an incorrect value for the inclination of the inner gas disk ( @xmath72 ) or the angle between its projected major axis and the slit ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "these angles are derived from images of the emission - line gas disk at arcsec scales and larger ( see vk00 for discussion ) . however , the ellipticity of the gas disk isophotes in the range 02510 is @xmath1090.170.37 .",
    "vk00 interpreted this as thickening of the gas disk .",
    "alternatively , by allowing the disk to be actually more face - on , the ellipticity is consistent with inclinations between @xmath110 and @xmath111 . by constructing models for various @xmath112 , we find that a model with @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath103 indeed provides a reasonable and much better fit to the stis mean gas velocities at @xmath115 than a model with @xmath116 ( figure  [ fig : gas_modeling ] ) .",
    "however , this interpretation implies that the gas disk is warped ( e.g.  statler 2001 ) and that it can not reside in the equatorial plane of the galaxy for @xmath117 ( the galaxy inclination can not be lower than @xmath71 : see section 4.1 ) .",
    "although the spherical bh potential dominates the galaxy potential for @xmath118 , the severe warping likely invalidates the assumption of a thin circular gas disk in equilibrium .",
    "second , it is possible that the underlying assumptions of our model are incorrect , and that the gas does not move on circular orbits in an infinitely thin disk . in our models",
    "we have assumed that the observed velocity dispersion of the gas is ` turbulent ' and does not contribute to its hydrostatic support .",
    "however , it may be that the gas is better modeled as individual clouds that move ballistically . in this case",
    "the velocity dispersion would contribute to the hydrostatic support and the gas would rotate slower than the circular velocity ( asymmetric drift ) .",
    "this would have caused our models to underpredict the bh mass .",
    "if @xmath119 is small , then the upward correction to the bh mass is small and it can be estimated using approximate equations for asymmetric drift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , for ic  1459 the value of @xmath119 of order unity , and to properly estimate the bh mass one would have to construct axisymmetric collisionless models for the gas kinematics .",
    "this is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , one limiting case that can be calculated fairly easily is to assume that the gas can be modeled through the jeans equations as an isotropic spherical distribution of collisionless cloudlets .",
    "this may not be entirely unreasonable , given that the isophotes of the gas disk become rounder towards the center .",
    "we find that the bh mass must then be @xmath120 to reproduce the observed central velocity dispersion of the gas ( this supersedes the somewhat smaller value that we quoted for this scenario in vk00 ) .",
    "third , it is possible that our models for the gas kinematics of ic  1459 are flawed at an even more basic level",
    ". the gas may not be in equilibrium .",
    "the fact that ic  1459 has a counter - rotating core , possibly indicative of a recent accretion event , may be of relevance in this context . or alternatively , the gas kinematics ( mean velocities _ and _ velocity dispersions ) may not be dominated by gravitational forces . for galaxies in which the central emission - line gas displays a liner - type spectrum the gas excitation mechanism might be shock - ionization ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as opposed to photo - ionization ( as inferred for seyferts and quasars ) .",
    "ic  1459 indeed shows liner - type emission and hence shocks may influence the gas kinematics .",
    "ic  1459 was originally identified by us as a good candidate for thin - disk modeling because of the regular , smooth and prominent rotation evident in ground - based ctio spectra . with fos , spectra",
    "could only be obtained for a few individual apertures ( vk00 ) .",
    "this yielded insufficient information to test the hypothesis that the gas is indeed rotating in a thin disk .",
    "the new stis spectra provide a more complete view of the gas disk kinematics and clearly show that thin disk models are oversimplified .",
    "the gas does not rotate at all at @xmath121 , indicating that the true state of the gas must be considerably more complicated than what we have been able to represent in any of our models .",
    "in hindsight , ic  1459 is a poor galaxy for which to attempt a gas kinematical determination of the central bh mass .",
    "the values that we have inferred range from @xmath122 ( thin gas disk ) to @xmath9 ( spherical distribution of cloudlets ) , but we can not attach strong confidence to either of these numbers .      the highest spatial resolution stellar kinematical data presented here are based on a stis spectrum obtained in 4 orbits of hst time .",
    "while this is a significant exposure time , the s / n of the spectrum is relatively low ( due mostly to the very narrow slit employed ) .",
    "this has several consequences .",
    "the low s /",
    "n , the relatively low spectral resolution , and the presence of prominent gas emission lines filling important absorption features , prevent the reliable extraction of higher - order gauss  hermite moments . as a result ,",
    "we can only obtain the mean velocity @xmath24 and velocity dispersion @xmath11 of the best - fit gaussian , with error bars that are considerably larger than those for the ground - based kinematics .",
    "furthermore , the unresolved source of featureless non - thermal continuum that dominates the central spectrum of ic  1459 prevents the measurement of the stellar kinematics inside 01 .",
    "the latter is particularly unfortunate , because the influence of a bh is always expected to be largest close to the galaxy center .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath11 profiles derived from the stis spectrum ( for @xmath12301 ) do not show any obvious evidence for the presence of a bh ( figure  [ fig : plot_fit_stis ] ) . while the central velocity gradient is steeper than the one measured from the ground",
    ", there is no strong central increase in @xmath11 .",
    "also , the value of @xmath11 at 01 is no larger than the central dispersion observed from the ground .",
    "this might suggest a low black hole mass , and indeed , a dynamical model with the value , derived from the gas kinematics , of @xmath124 , is consistent with the stis data .",
    "however , our model with the much larger mass of @xmath103 ( inferred from our analysis of all the stellar kinematical data ) is also consistent .",
    "the reason for this surprising fact can be understood by considering the losvd predicted by the model with @xmath103 for the stis apertures closest to the center ( @xmath125 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : stis_losvd ] ) .",
    "it is strongly non - gaussian and has very broad wings , caused by the high - velocity stars near the central bh .",
    "qualitatively similar profiles , close to the bh , were predicted with analytic models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and have been observed with hst since ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma_true ] shows that the true centered moment @xmath126 displays a large increase inside the bh sphere of influence ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "this rise is absent in @xmath11 because the best - fitting gaussian is quite insensitive to the wings , and as a result the model can fit the flat @xmath11 profile even with a large black hole mass .    as a further check of the consistency of our @xmath128 dynamical model with the stis observations , we convolved a well - sampled k3 iii stellar template with the predicted model losvd at the different apertures along the stis slit and rebinned this to the stis pixel scale .",
    "the spectrum thus obtained was processed through the same procedure , described in section  [ sec : hst_spec ] , to extract the @xmath24 and @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting values agree to within the errors with the model profiles presented in figure  [ fig : plot_fit_stis ] .    for the above reasons ,",
    "our black hole mass estimate is determined primarily by the ground - based data .",
    "our axisymmetric models take into account the limited spatial resolution of the data , and they formally rule out the bh mass @xmath124 that was suggested by the gas kinematics .",
    "this comes about because the central @xmath11 measured from the ground is larger than the models can handle with a black hole mass of less than @xmath129 , while also fitting the higher order moments",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_bh ] shows just how small this effect is .",
    "the effect is formally quite significant , but this assumes that there are no uncertainties involved in the data - model comparison other than gaussian random errors .",
    "this is obviously an oversimplification . on the one hand ,",
    "the underlying assumptions of the models may not be fully correct .",
    "for example , ic  1459 could be significantly triaxial , the stars may not yet have settled into an equilibrium configuration , or line - of - sight projections may be partially compromised by dust . on the other hand , there could be systemic problems with the data , e.g. , due to continuum subtraction or template mismatching . such effects can easily compromise the data at the few percent level @xcite . since the very central region",
    "is affected by a continuum component that is not present at larger radii , it is quite possible that these errors could depend on radius . while there are no obvious indications that any of these issues may be affecting our analysis , it does mean that our bh mass determination via the stellar kinematics should be treated with caution .",
    "the accuracy of stellar dynamical bh mass determinations hinges critically on the availability of full losvd measurements inside the bh sphere of influence .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to secure such a measurements with hst due to the complications introduced by the modest @xmath0 , the presence of a non - thermal nuclear point source and of strong gas emission lines .",
    "our bh mass measurement @xmath6 therefore rests primarily on @xmath130 resolution ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "this makes the accuracy of our measurement rather modest , despite the use of three - integral models and the well - defined formal errorbar .",
    "we studied the dynamics of the elliptical galaxy ic  1459 using self - consistent axisymmetric dynamical models based on schwarzschild s orbit superposition method .",
    "the intrinsic density is obtained by deprojecting the observed hst / wfpc2 surface density using an mge parametrization , after correction for the effects of patchy dust absorption .",
    "the axisymmetric model provides an excellent fit to all hst and ground - based kinematical constraints along five slit positions , while also matching the observed hst photometry .",
    "moreover we verified that the model velocity histograms indeed reproduce the observed losvds and not only its moments .",
    "the good match to the observations obtained with an axisymmetric model provides a test that the counterrotating core in ic  1459 can be accurately described as an axisymmetric stellar component .",
    "we explored the @xmath22 map as a function of the three free parameters of the problem @xmath131 and subsequently analyzed the best fit solution by adding linear regularization constraints in the integral space .",
    "the observations can only be reproduced if @xmath3% of the galaxy stellar mass ( @xmath132 ) counterrotates in the radial range @xmath133 on nearly circular orbits in a flattened disk .",
    "this counterrotating component is found to be very well separated from the bulk of the stars in integral space .",
    "the mass estimation of the counterrotating stellar component is only possible by using dynamical modeling , since the decoupled component does not show in the surface brightness or color maps and can not be isolated from the observed line profiles .",
    "these results could be explained by a scenario in which the stellar counterrotating core in ic  1459 has an external origin , as evidenced by its clear isolation in integral space from the bulk of the stars in the galaxy .",
    "for example , the core may have formed by acquisition of a gas - rich component that settled into a disk in the galaxy potential and later turned into stars . in this scenario",
    "it is likely that the acquisition must have happened long ago .",
    "the current stellar core counterrotates not only with respect to the outer stellar body but also with respect to the nuclear gas - disk of ic  1459 , which must have formed later .",
    "numerical simulations of gas accretion by a bh that leads to disk formation and bh fueling were made by e.g. @xcite however , other formation scenarios are also possible . for example , @xcite showed that , in the presence of a central bh , a rapidly rotating counterrotating core can also be produced by acquisition of a dense stellar satellite .",
    "ic  1459 has a rotating gas component near its center .",
    "this offers the opportunity to estimate the bh mass independently from either gaseous or stellar kinematics . for both",
    "we have available high spatial resolution long - slit kinematics from stis , as well as ground - based kinematics along multiple position angles .",
    "unfortunately , we have found that neither the gaseous nor the stellar kinematics yield a very stringent determination of the bh mass .",
    "the main problem for the gas kinematical modeling is that there is evidence that the gas motions are disturbed , possibly due to non - gravitational forces acting on the gas .",
    "the main problem for the stellar kinematical modeling is that we were unable to obtain an hst measurement of the stellar losvd inside the bh sphere of influence , due to the modest @xmath0 of our stis spectrum and due to the presence of the non - thermal nuclear point source of ic  1459 and prominent gas emission lines .",
    "consequently , the stellar dynamically inferred bh mass hinges almost exclusively on the low spatial - resolution ground - based data .",
    "these complications may explain why we find rather discrepant bh masses with the different methods .",
    "the gas kinematics suggests that @xmath134 if the gas is assumed to rotate at the circular velocity in a thin disk .",
    "alternatively , the central velocity dispersion of the gas implies that @xmath135 if the gas is modeled as an isotropic spherical distribution of ballistic cloudlets .",
    "the stellar kinematics suggest that @xmath6 .",
    "these different estimates bracket the value @xmath10 predicted by the @xmath5-@xmath11 relation @xcite as given by tremaine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    to our knowledge ,",
    "ic  1459 is only the second galaxy ( pinkney et al.2000 modeled ngc 4697 ) for which a bh mass determination has been attempted with hst observations of both gaseous and stellar kinematics .",
    "unfortunately , as it turned out , ic  1459 may not been the best galaxy to attempt such a comparison . however , it certainly is important to perform such comparisons .",
    "they provide insight into the reliability of bh mass determinations , which is necessary to properly understand the correlation between the bh mass correlation and other global galaxy parameters ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 and the refs therein ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant if one wants to understand the scatter in such relations and their implications for our understanding of the galaxy formation process .    with the availability of 2d spectroscopic detectors ( e.g. sauron on wht , vimos on vlt , gmos on gemini ) it is possible to obtain fully two - dimensional distributions of losvds and line - strengths of kinematically decoupled cores ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "these observations will provide a much larger number of kinematical constraints than can be obtained from a small number of slit positions , which results in dynamical models that better constrain the model parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , especially if they resolve the radius of influence of the bh . in turn , this will improve the reliability of internal dynamical studies such as that presented in this paper .",

    "we desire a maximum relative error of @xmath141 for the potential .",
    "this is at least two orders of magnitude more accurate than what can generally be achieved for photometric measurements .",
    "an approximate expression for the potential at large radii can be found using a multipole expansion of the potential ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "terminating the expansion at the first term , @xmath142 in equation  ( [ eq : integral ] ) equals @xmath143 and the potential reduces to the potential of a point mass with mass @xmath144 . even in the thin disk limit , a maximum relative error @xmath141 is obtained outside the sphere @xmath145 . in the case of positive gaussians this is a conservative estimate for the total relative error in the potential , since it applies only to one gaussian , while in practice not all gaussians in the expansion will be in the least favorable condition at the same time .",
    "this error limitation is generally not true when the mge is composed by both positive and negative gaussians , due to cancellation effects .",

    "<S> although both tracers rule out models without a central black hole , neither yields a particularly accurate determination of the black hole mass . </S>",
    "<S> the main problem for the stellar dynamical modeling is the fact that the modest @xmath0 of the stis spectrum and the presence of strong gas emission lines preclude measuring the full line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) at hst resolution . </S>",
