    "relativistic jets are the most dramatic consequence of accretion onto stellar mass ( black hole binaries : bhbs ) and supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "blazars are extreme examples of this , where the jet is viewed very close to the line of sight so its emission is maximally boosted by the relativistic bulk motion and can dominate the spectrum of the agn from the lowest radio energies up to tev . however , despite years of study , the fundamental issues of powering and launching the jets are not understood .",
    "there is general agreement only that it requires magnetic fields , but whether these can be generated solely from the accretion flow or whether the jets also tap the spin energy of the black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) is still an open question .",
    "it is also difficult to test this observationally as neither black hole spin nor total jet power are easy to measure , leading to divergent views e.g. in bhbs compare russell , gallo & fender 2013 with narayan & mcclintock ( 2012 ) , and in smbhs compare sikora , stawarz & lasota ( 2007 ) with broderick & fender ( 2011 ) .    by contrast , the radiation emitted from the jet is fairly well understood , with spectra separating the blazars into two types : bl lacs and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "bl lacs are typically completely dominated by the jet emission , emitting a double humped synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) spectrum .",
    "the fsrqs are more complex , showing clear signatures of a normal agn disc and broad line region ( blr ) , unlike the bl lacs which generally show no broad lines or disc emission .",
    "this lack of a standard disc / blr in the bl lacs is not just an effect from the relativistically boosted jet emission drowning out these components : the fsrqs have similarly boosted jet emission yet the disc and blr are still clearly visible .",
    "additionally , the presence of the disc and blr in fsrqs means that there is an additional source of seed photons for cooling of relativistic particles in the jet , so their jet emission includes both ssc and external compton ( ec ) components ( dermer , schlickeiser & mastichiadis 1992 ; sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) , clearly contrasting with the ssc only jets in bl lacs .",
    "thus the nature of the accretion flow itself is different in bl lacs and fsrqs , with the latter showing a standard disc which is absent from the former .",
    "this can be linked to the clear distinction in eddington ratio between bl lacs and fsrqs , with the bl lacs all consistent with @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 and efficiency @xmath4 depends on black hole spin ) while the fsrqs have @xmath5 ( see e.g. ghisellini et al 2010 , hereafter g10 ) .",
    "this observed transition in accretion flow properties occurs very close to the maximum luminosity of the alternative ( non - disc ) solutions of the accretion flow equations . these result in a radiatively inefficient , hot , optically thin , geometrically thick flow ( e.g. adafs : narayan & yi 1995 ) instead of a standard shakura - sunyaev , cool , optically thick , geometrically thin disc .",
    "thus the bl lacs have luminosity below this transition and can be associated with the radiatively inefficient flows , while fsrqs accrete at higher rates and have standard disks ( see e.g. ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 ; g10 ; ghisellini et al 2011 , best & heckman 2012 ) .",
    "a similar transition is probably present in all types of agn , not just the radio loud objects .",
    "this predicts that a uv bright accretion disk is only present at @xmath6 .",
    "most ( all ? ) radio quiet seyferts and quasars accrete above this limit ( see e.g. woo & urry 2002 ) .",
    "strong uv is required to excite the broad emission lines , and the material which makes the broad line region ( blr ) may also be a wind from the disk ( e.g. murray & chiang 1997 , czerny & hryniewicz 2012 ) , so when the disk is replaced by a hot flow there is no strong uv emission and no broad lines - hence perhaps the liners which are associated with @xmath7 ( e.g. satyapal et al 2005 ) .",
    "additional evidence for this accretion flow transition comes from the much lower mass bhbs , which show a dramatic spectral switch around @xmath8 ( narayan & yi 1995 ; esin et al 1997 see e.g. done , gierlinski & kubota 2007 for a discussion of how this can explain the observed behaviour of bhbs ) .",
    "since all bl lacs are associated with a low @xmath9 accretion flow , we test here the hypothesis that all low @xmath9 flows can launch a jet whose properties are determined simply by mass and mass accretion rate .",
    "we use the simplest possible scalings for how the jet ( emission region size , magnetic field and injected power ) scales with these parameters ( heinz & sunyaev 2003 ; heinz 2004 ) , anchoring our scalings onto the fits to individual bl lac objects of g10 .",
    "we then can predict the jet spectra from black holes at any mass and mass accretion rate .",
    "we restrict our work to systems with @xmath7 , ie .",
    "bl lac type jets , to avoid the additional uncertainties of external seed photon density scaling with @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "we use cosmological simulations to predict the number densities of black holes with @xmath7 , and assume that each of these will produce an appropriately scaled bl lac type jet . we include electron cooling , losses due to pair production on extragalactic background light and orientation effects from beaming to predict how many bl lacs should be detected by fermi . this is a statistical approach to constraining jet power in the population as a whole ( cf .",
    "martnez - sansigre & rawlings 2011 ) , contrasting with most other previous approaches which determine jet power from detailed spectral fitting to individual sources .",
    "we compare our predicted mass and redshift distributions with observations , and find we overpredict the observed number of bl lacs by a factor of 1000 .",
    "this strongly argues for another parameter apart from mass and mass accretion rate being required to produce bl lac type jets .",
    "the most plausible additional factor which can affect the small size scales of the fermi emission region is black hole spin .",
    "if this is indeed the answer - and there is longstanding speculation that high spin is required to produce the most relativistic jets - then this requires that high spin objects are rare .",
    "this is not the case if the smbh grows in mass in prolonged accretion episodes , as the accreted angular momentum can quickly spin the black hole up to maximal ( volonteri et al 2005 ; 2007 ; 2012 : fanidakis et al 2011 ) .",
    "instead , it requires that the smbh mass build up via accretion is from multiple , randomly aligned smaller episodes , resulting in low spin ( king et al 2008 ) .",
    "the only high spin black holes in these simulations are the most massive , where the last increase in mass was via a black hole - black hole coalescence following a major host galaxy merger ( volonteri et al 2005 ; 2007 ; 2012 : fanidakis et al 2011 ; 2012 )",
    "we adopt a single zone ssc model of the type used by ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2009 ) , which self consistently determines the electron distribution from cooling .",
    "we briefly summarise our model here , with full details in the appendix .",
    "we assume a spherical emission region of radius @xmath11 .",
    "we neglect the contribution from regions further out along the jet , as these only make a difference to the low energy ( predominantly radio ) emission .",
    "we assume material in the jet moves at a constant bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath12 ) , and that a fraction of the resulting jet power is used to accelerate electrons in the emission region .",
    "the power injected into relativistic electrons is then @xmath13 , where the accelerated electron distribution is a broken power law of the form :    @xmath14    these electrons cool by emitting self absorbed synchrotron and synchrotron self - compton radiation , so the seed photon energy density @xmath15 includes both the magnetic energy density @xmath16 , and the fraction @xmath17 of the energy density of synchrotron seed photons , @xmath18 , which can be compton scattered by electrons of energy @xmath19 within the klein - nishina limit .",
    "this gives rise to a steady state electron distribution , @xmath20 , where the rate at which an electron loses energy @xmath21 .",
    "however , this assumes that the electrons can cool within a light crossing time , but the cooling timescale @xmath22 itself depends on @xmath19 , with high energy electrons cooling fastest .",
    "we calculate the lorentz factor that can just cool in a light crossing time of the region,@xmath23 , and join smoothly onto the accelerated electron distribution below this .",
    "the full self consistent electron distribution can be characterised by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the number density of electrons at @xmath26 and @xmath27 incorporates all the spectral shape .",
    "we calculate the resulting ( self absorbed ) synchrotron and self compton emission using the delta function approximation as this is much faster than using the full kernel but is accurate enough for our statistical analysis ( dermer & menon 2009 ) .",
    "this jet frame emission is boosted by the bulk motion of the jet , with the amount of boosting depending on both @xmath12 and the orientation of the jet .",
    "the emission is then cosmologically redshifted and attenuated due to pair production on the extragalactic infrared background light ( though this is generally small for the fermi bandpass ) to produce the observed flux .",
    "the parameters of our model are therefore :    * physical parameters of the jet : @xmath12 and radius of emission region @xmath11 . * the magnetic field of the emission region and power injected into relativistic electrons ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "* parameters of the injected electron distribution : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we adopt the cosmology used in the millennium simulations : @xmath35 @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( springel et al 2005 ; fanidakis et al 2011 ) .",
    "we assume that the acceleration mechanism is the same for all bl lacs , giving the same injected electron distribution , regardless of mass and accretion rate .",
    "we also assume all jets are produced with the same @xmath12 .",
    "this leaves three remaining parameters : @xmath11 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we scale @xmath38 , since all size scales should scale with the mass of the black hole ( heinz & sunyaev 2003 ) .",
    "we assume the jet power is a constant fraction of the total accretion power , @xmath39 .",
    "this assumption is valid whether the jet is powered by the accretion flow or the spin energy of the black hole , since extraction of black hole spin energy relies on magnetic fields generated in the accretion flow , which will be affected by accretion rate . a constant fraction of the total jet power is then injected into relativistic particles and magnetic fields . hence @xmath40 .",
    "energy density in the jet frame is related to power in the rest frame via @xmath41 , so @xmath42 , hence @xmath43 .",
    "therefore all energy densities should scale as @xmath44 .",
    "we anchor this with parameters from the fit to the classic low peaked bl lac ( lbl ) object , 1749 + 096 from g10 , which is relatively near to the top of the bl lac accretion rate range .",
    "this gives @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and we scale @xmath11 , @xmath29 and @xmath28 as :    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    we calculate the accretion rate of 1749 + 096 following the method of g10 . assuming the jet is maximal ( @xmath58 ) , we sum the power in magnetic fields , relativistic electrons and the bulk motion of cold protons to calculate @xmath59 , giving :    @xmath60    for their value of @xmath61 .",
    "fig 1 shows our model spectrum , together with the model and data from g10 .",
    "the two models differ slightly due to our use of the delta function approximation to speed up calculation time .",
    "nevertheless the two models are in agreement within @xmath62 dex , and crucially our model reproduces the correct level of fermi flux ( red bow tie ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     cosmological simulations predict the number of supermassive black holes accreting at different redshifts , together with their masses and accretion rates .",
    "these simulations have been found to agree well with the observed number densities of broad line and narrow line agn in the local universe ( fanidakis et al 2011 ; 2012 ) .",
    "combining our spectral code with the black hole data from these simulations allows us to predict the number of agn that should be detected as bl lacs by fermi .",
    "we combine our code with the black hole number densities predicted by the millennium simulation ( springel et al 2005 ; fanidakis et al 2011 ; 2012 ) , binned as a function of both mass and mass accretion rate .",
    "we define a luminosity density from the number density multiplied by the luminosity at that mass and mass accretion rate i.e. @xmath63 for the thin disc regime @xmath64 , joining smoothly onto a radiatively inefficient regime at lower @xmath9 where @xmath65 ( narayan & yi 1995 ) and onto a super - eddington flow at higher @xmath9 where @xmath66 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the luminosity density in each @xmath67 bin therefore depends on the mass , accretion rate , spin ( which sets @xmath4 ) , the inferred accretion regime and the number of black holes in that bin .",
    "fig 4 shows the evolution of the luminosity density of accretion power across cosmic time showing the features described by fanidakis et al ( 2011 ; 2012 ) . at high redshift",
    "there is plenty of gas to fuel accretion .",
    "the black holes accrete close to the eddington limit and grow rapidly . comparing the snapshots for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the typical black hole mass producing the bulk of the accretion luminosity increases from @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "as the black holes gradually run out of gas , their accretion rates drop ( compare @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) . by redshift 2",
    ", accretion rates are beginning to drop below @xmath74 , into the regime at which bl lac type jets should be produced .",
    "this suggests no bl lacs should be observed much above @xmath72 , not just because the flux becomes too faint , but because the typical accretion rate is too high for the production of bl lac jets .",
    "we select only black holes in the radiatively inefficient regime ( @xmath75 ) , assuming all bhs accreting inefficiently will produce a bl lac type jet , and calculate the number of agn hosting a bl lac type jet in each @xmath67 bin . if this number is less than 1 we use poisson statistics to randomly determine whether a bh is present or not . each black hole in each @xmath67 bin is then assigned a random distance within this redshift bin and random @xmath76 , assuming @xmath77 is distributed uniformly .",
    "we then calculate the observed spectrum to determine whether or not the jet would be visible to fermi .",
    "fig 5a shows the predicted redshift distribution of fermi visible bl lacs ( black )",
    ". the predicted distribution peaks at @xmath78 and drops gradually to @xmath72 .",
    "no bl lacs are observed above this point , not because they are not visible ( see fig 3b ) , but because there simply are not enough smbhs accreting below @xmath79 in the cosmological simulations to produce ssc jets , due to the higher activity expected at earlier times .",
    "the low redshift distribution of bl lacs is a direct result of cosmic downsizing and the requirement of an @xmath75 to produce a ssc jet .",
    "however , comparing this to observations shows a huge discrepancy ( red solid line from shaw et al 2013 , which almost merges with the x - axis at this scale ) .",
    "our expected number of @xmath80 bl lacs dramatically overpredicts the observed number of fermi detections ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "a clear illustration of the problem can be seen from simply the number density of massive ( @xmath82 ) black hole accretion flows with @xmath83 in the cosmological simulations in the redshift bin centred around @xmath78 ( fanidakis et al 2011 ) .",
    "this number is @xmath84 and the volume of this bin , from @xmath85 is @xmath86 gpc@xmath87 so this gives @xmath88 objects which should host similar jets to 1749 + 096 ( fig 1 ) , i.e. have fermi flux of @xmath89 ergs @xmath90 s@xmath91 if viewed at the same angle ( roughly @xmath92 ) . the probability that we see the source within this angle is @xmath93 ,",
    "so the expected number of fermi detections of these sources alone is @xmath94 , similar to the full calculation results .",
    "the large discrepancy clearly points to a fundamental breakdown of one of the assumptions .    on a more subtle level , the shape of the redshift distribution for the fermi predictions is also mismatched to the observations .",
    "the red dashed line shows the observed number of bl lacs scaled by a factor of 100 so it can be compared to the predicted distribution .",
    "we define redshift from shaw et al ( 2013 ) as either spectroscopic redshift , spectroscopic lower limit , the mean of their redshifts derived from host galaxy fitting , or their redshift upper limits , in that order of preference .",
    "the dashed line shows this observed redshift distribution ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "it is clear that not only is the total predicted number wrong , but we are also over estimating the proportion of bl lacs in the range @xmath96 .",
    "the mass distribution and mass accretion rate distributions are as expected ( figs 5b and c ) , with higher luminosity ssc flows ( i.e. higher @xmath97 ) being more likely to be observed , so simple energetics selects the highest mass and mass accretion rate objects , so the typical predicted mass of a fermi visible bl lac @xmath98 is a combination of three factors :    1 .",
    "very few black holes accreting at @xmath75 above @xmath99 .",
    "2 .   most black holes at @xmath100 accreting with @xmath75 have @xmath101 .",
    "3 .   black holes with @xmath102 are increasingly rare in the local universe so we are less likely to observe one favourably orientated to our line of sight .",
    "our results predict @xmath103 bl lacs should have been detected in the fermi 2 year catalogue .",
    "in contrast , @xmath104 objects in the 2nd fermi lat catalogue are classed as bl lacs . even allowing for galactic centre emission limiting sky coverage",
    "( @xmath105 means that only 80% of the sky is included ) , this is still 3 orders of magnitude larger than observed .",
    "clearly jets do not simply scale with accretion power .",
    "we assumed the injected electron distribution was independent of mass accretion rate .",
    "this may not be the case .",
    "ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2009 ) approximately use @xmath106 to fit their blazar sequence .",
    "acceleration of electrons is affected by the ambient photon field which depends on the amount of cooling and ultimately on accretion rate . in the efficient cooling regime , @xmath107 , making @xmath108 not unreasonable .",
    "however , an increase of @xmath32 , and @xmath31 in particular , only serves to increase the fermi band luminosity for lower @xmath9 systems , and increase the discrepancy between the predictions and observations .    the discrepancy",
    "could instead be explained if every bh accreting below @xmath79 has the potential to produce a bl lac type jet , but only does so @xmath109 of the time .",
    "this seems unlikely , since fanaroff riley type i ( fri ) agn , the misaligned versions of bl lacs ( padovani & urry 1990 , padovani & urry 1991 , urry , padovani & stickel 1991 ) show large scale extended radio jets .",
    "this suggests these jets are persistent , analogous to the steady low / hard state jet seen in bhbs at low @xmath9 , not transient events .",
    "another possibility is that the jet depends on magnetic flux being advected onto the black hole from the extremely large scale hot halo gas around the galaxy .",
    "sikora & begelman ( 2013 ) suggest that if there is magnetic flux in this gas , then it could be dragged down close to the black hole by cold gas from a merging spiral galaxy",
    ". however , this does not address the fundamental question as to where the magnetic flux in the halo gas comes from , and using cold gas from a spiral merger to drag this field down to the black hole is unlikely to be applicable in the bl lacs as they have low ongoing mass accretion rates .",
    "the bulk lorentz factor of the jet is the biggest factor affecting its visibility .",
    "we rerun our calculations with a reduced @xmath110 instead of 15 and find this roughly halves the predicted number of bl lacs , but still wildly overpredicts the observations .",
    "we have assumed all jets are produced with the same value of bulk lorentz factor but this is clearly not the case - bhbs at low @xmath9 have @xmath111 ( fender et al 2004 ) . the most obvious way to reduce",
    "the number of visible bl lacs is to allow a distribution of @xmath12 .",
    "yet there must be some physical parameter which controls the jet acceleration .",
    "the acceleration region , where the magnetic ( poynting ) flux of the jet is converted to kinetic energy , is very close to the black hole , so it seems most likely that this is set by the black hole itself , in which case black hole spin is the only remaining plausible parameter .",
    "a potential explanation for the lower number of observed bl lacs is that if only bhs with the highest spin produce highly relativistic jets , and high spin is rare .",
    "the cosmological simulations include the growth of smbh spin via accretion processes and black hole - black hole coalescence following galaxy mergers ( volonteri et al 2005 ; 2007 ; 2012 : fanidakis et al 2011 ; 2012 ) .",
    "the mass accumulated onto the central smbh in an accretion event is tied in the simulation to a fixed fraction ( 0.5% ) of the mass of gas in a star formation episode in the host galaxy .",
    "if this mass is all accreted in a single event ( prolonged accretion ) then this is sufficient to spin most black holes up to maximal ( volonteri et al 2005 ; 2007 ) .",
    "however , the mass accreting onto the central black hole in any single event may be limited by self gravity .",
    "this splits the accreting material up into multiple smaller events , each of which can be randomly aligned since the star formation scale height is large compared to the black hole sphere of influence even in a disc galaxy ( king et al 2008 ) .",
    "such chaotic accretion flow models result in predominantly low spin black holes ( volonteri et al 2007 : king et al 2008 : fanidakis et al 2011 ; 2012 ) , and high spins are rare as they are produced not via accretion but via black hole mergers ( fanidakis et al 2011 ; 2012 ) .",
    "we use the spin distribution from the chaotic accretion flow model simulations , and introduce a spin cut to our results , so that only bhs with spin greater than @xmath112 produce a bl lac type jet .",
    "this reduces the predicted number of fermi visible bl lacs to @xmath113 .",
    "fig 6a shows the resulting redshift distribution together with the observed distribution .",
    "not only does this reduce the discrepancy between predicted and observed total numbers , it also gives a better match to the shape of the distribution .",
    "limiting production of bl lac type jets to bhs with high spin causes the redshift distribution to peak slightly later and drop off more sharply above @xmath114 .",
    "this is because high spins arise from bh mergers .",
    "production of bl lac jets is already limited to bhs accreting below @xmath79 , ie .",
    "the bh mergers which make the most massive bhs occurs at the latest times .",
    "fig 6b and 6c show how this affects the predicted mass and accretion rate distributions of fermi visible bl lacs .",
    "the scaled down distributions including bhs of all spins are shown by the dashed lines for comparison .",
    "requiring high spin increases the peak of the mass distribution to @xmath115 , because it is the most massive bhs that are former by mergers and are consequently more likely to have high spin .",
    "the peak of the accretion rate distribution is actually slightly reduced .",
    "this is because the more massive bhs have lower accretion rates ; the spin cut has excluded lower mass bhs with lower spins which tend to have slightly higher accretion rates .",
    "the low spin , low accretion rate bhs , which generally have smaller masses ( @xmath116 ) correspond to the liners , which are not observed to have jets as relativistic as those in bl lacs .",
    "if they are low spin , as expected , and high spin is required for a highly relativistic jet , then this naturally explains why liners are observed to have weaker radio jets .",
    "the parent population of bl lacs is probably the fanaroff riley type i ( fri ) sources ( e.g. the review by urry & padovani 1995 )",
    ". these show fluffy radio jets whose surface brightness decreases with distance from the central source , contrasting with the classic lobe and hotspot radio emission seen in the more powerful frii sources which are the parent population of the fsrq ( padovani & urry 1992 ) .",
    "thus the fri sources should also correspond to high spin bhs , and indeed are similarly powered by high mass smbhs ( woo & urry 2002 ) .",
    "however , we might then expect some difference in jet radio emission between the fris and lower mass liners as the cosmological simulations predict that the lower mass smbhs have lower spin ( fanidakis et al 2011 ; 2012 ) .",
    "sikora et al ( 2007 ) claim that this difference is indeed seen , with radio emission being @xmath117 orders of magnitude higher in the fris .",
    "however , some of this difference disappears when only core radio luminosity ( rather than core plus lobes ) is used ( broderick & fender 2011 ) .",
    "this is clearly an issue as the extended radio emission must depend on environment .",
    "the bhs in fris are more massive than those in liners , hence live in richer cluster environments , with larger dark matter halos which trap more hot cluster gas .",
    "the jet then emerges into a denser , higher pressure environment , which means that a much larger fraction ( potentially all ) of the jet kinetic energy is converted to radiation and/or heating of the cluster gas ( birzan et al 2004 ) .",
    "conversely , any jet from the lower mass liners emerges into a poorer group environment , so adiabatic losses can predominate and the extended radio emission is much smaller ( e.g. krause et al 2012 ) .    some of the remaining difference in core radio power is _ expected _ due to the difference in mass ( broderick & fender 2011 ) .",
    "however , even accounting for this there is still a factor of @xmath118 in mass corrected , core radio emission .",
    "the liners lie on the fundamental plane ( merloni et al 2003 ; falcke et al 2004 ) i.e. have the expected core radio emission for their black hole mass and mass accretion rate , so the fris are a factor 10 brighter in mass corrected , core radio emission than expected from the same jet models which produce the low bulk lorentz factor bhb and liner jets , consistent with the idea that the jet is intrinsically more powerful / has higher lorentz factor due to black hole spin .",
    "it is difficult to predict the difference in core radio emission with black hole spin in our models as synchrotron self - absorption means that the observed radio emission does not arise in the same region as produces the fermi flux .",
    "it may be produced either at larger radii , perhaps where the jet has decelerated , or in a lower density , lower bulk lorentz factor layer surrounding the @xmath49 spine of the jet .",
    "either of these could explain the lower lorentz factor ( @xmath119 ) of the radio jet observed in fris ( chiaberge et al 2000 ) , though the spine - layer structure may additionally be able to explain the very fast variability timescales seen in some bl lacs ( ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 ) .",
    "we have taken a statistical approach to constrain the conditions necessary to produce the highly relativistic jets seen in bl lac objects .",
    "we combine smbh number densities from cosmological simulations , known to reproduce the optical luminosity function of agn , with spectral models of jet emission and simple jet scaling functions which depend only on mass and accretion rate .",
    "the key assumption is that every bh accreting with @xmath75 i.e. in the radiatively inefficient accretion flow regime , should produce a bl lac type jet .",
    "our calculation of the expected number of bl lacs detectable by fermi overpredicts the observations by three orders of magnitude .",
    "this clearly shows that our fundamental assumptions are incorrect , and that the jet power and properties do not scale simply with mass and mass accretion rate . the only other parameter which a black hole can have is spin .",
    "we can reproduce the observed numbers of bl lacs if smbhs grow predominantly via chaotic ( randomly aligned ) accretion episodes , and that bl lac type jets are restricted to bhs with spin @xmath120 .",
    "these are rare as they form from bh - bh coalescence following a major merger event which is not then overwhelmed by further chaotic accretion i.e. this requires a gas poor major merger event , and only the most massive galaxies , which host the most massive black holes , are gas poor in the local universe ( fanidakis et al 2011 ; 2012 ) .",
    "a spin cut is in line with the longstanding speculation that these most relativistic jets require high spin black holes ( maraschi et al 2012 ) , and also gives a good match to the observed redshift distribution of bl lacs which peaks at @xmath114 and then drops off sharply , with no objects above @xmath72 .",
    "this is a consequence of three factors :    1 .",
    "bl lac jets are restricted to bhs with @xmath75 , and there are no bhs accreting at @xmath75 above @xmath72 .",
    "only the most massive bhs have high spin through mergers , which happen at late times , causing the bulk of the population to fall below @xmath121 3 .",

    "<S> this clearly shows that one of the underlying assumptions is incorrect , almost certainly that jets do not scale simply with mass and accretion rate . the most plausible additional parameter which can affect the region producing the fermi emission is black hole spin . we can reproduce the observed numbers of bl lacs if such relativistic jets are only produced by the highest spin ( @xmath1 ) black holes , in agreement with the longstanding spin - jet paradigm </S>",
