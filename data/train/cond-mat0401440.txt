    "the spectral analysis of schrdinger operators with periodic potentials has been investigated since the arbour of quantum mechanics . in spite of this , it still represents a non exhausted topic of ever continuing interest . from one side",
    ", it plays a fundamental role in condensed matter physics where it provides the mathematical basis of the quantum theory of solids . from the other , schrdinger operators with periodic and quasi - periodic potentials play an important role in the integration of the kortweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation .",
    "eigenstates of these operators , also called bloch functions ( bf ) , have been extensively studied during the past years by several authors ( see @xcite ) .",
    "an expression of the bf in terms of hyperelliptic @xmath0functions was given in ref .",
    "these studies were further developed in ref .",
    "@xcite where an algebro - geometric scheme for constructing solutions of non - linear equations was given in terms of the baker@xmath1akhiezer function .",
    "this function is uniquely defined on the riemann surface associated with the energy spectrum and its properties are natural generalizations of the analytical properties of the bf of finite - gap potentials .",
    "besides bf , another set of functions which play an equally important role in condensed matter physics are the wannier functions ( wf ) @xcite . these functions are related to bf by a unitary transformation and form a complete set of localised orthonormal functions spanning a bloch band .",
    "the properties of these functions were first investigated by kohn in 1959 @xcite in a classical paper in which the asymptotic decay of wannier functions was characterised for the case of centro - symmetrical one - dimensional potentials . since then , a large amount of work has been devoted to this topic and we mention here results only some of them .",
    "the projection operator technique was developed for construction of the wannier functions and the wannier functions were studied in the n - dimensional lattices @xcite , @xcite . the localization problem for the wannier functions",
    "was considered in a 1-dimensional case @xcite .",
    "these functions were utilized with success in new practical methods for the electron energy calculation of solids ( e.g. @xcite ) and in a number of modern calculation problems such as the photonic crystal circuits @xcite.the wannier functions represent the ideal basis for constructing effective hamiltonians of quantum problems involving spatial localizations induced by electric and magnetic fields @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .    in spite of this ,",
    "the properties of these functions are still not fully understood and , except for simplest cases , there are no models for which the analytical expression of the wf can be explicitly given .",
    "on the other hand , the recent results achieved in the field of completely integrable systems open the possibility to investigate analytical properties of the wf .",
    "quite interestingly , wf have not been considered in the field of finite gap potentials .",
    "the present paper represents a first contribution in this direction .",
    "in particular , we consider wf of schrdinger operators with one - gap potentials and use the well developed theory of elliptic functions to investigate their properties with sufficient completeness .",
    "as a result we derive : _",
    "i ) _ an exact value for the amplitude of the wf at the localization site ; _ ii ) _ an asymptotic expansion characterising the decay of the wf at large distances ; _ iii ) _ a power series expansion valid in the vicinity of the localization site . using results _",
    "ii),__iii ) , _ we construct an approximate analytical representation of the wf which is valid in the whole spatial domain .",
    "these results are shown to be in very good agreement with the wf obtained by means of numerical methods .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the basic properties of the bf for one gap potentials .",
    "in particular we introduce basic definitions , discuss the basic properties of bf and derive the analytical expression of their normalization constants .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the study of the wf . after recalling the basic definitions we derive the main results of the paper i.e. points _",
    "i)-iii ) _ listed above . in section 4",
    "we construct an approximate analytical expression of the wf and compare the results of our theory with wf obtained from the basic definition using numerical tools .",
    "finally , in section 5 we summarise the main results of the paper and briefly discuss future developments .",
    "in the paper we use standard notations and facts of the theory of elliptic functions . in particular we use the well known weierstrass @xmath2 and @xmath3functions .    the periodic elliptic one - gap potential @xmath4 considered in this paper ,",
    "is expressed in terms of the weierstrass @xmath5function as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the period of the lattice ( notice that @xmath8 is real and @xmath9 is a smooth periodic real function ) .",
