    "some of the recent cepheid measurements in galaxy clusters suggest a high value of the hubble constant , @xmath11 ( e.g. , pierce et al . 1994 ; freedman et al . 1994 ; tanvir et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , if the cosmological constant is zero , such a large hubble constant predicts an age of the universe that is lower than the calculated ages of globular clusters ( bolte & hogan 1995 ) . to account for this discrepancy",
    ", it has been proposed that the locally ( redshift @xmath12 ) observed hubble constant , @xmath13 , is actually higher than the global ( @xmath14 ) hubble constant , @xmath7 ( bartlett et al . 1995 ) .",
    "alternatively , it may be that these hubble constant measurements lie on the tail of their statistical and systematic error distributions .",
    "we use our first sample of seven @xmath15 type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) to address both these possibilities , first by directly comparing our sn ia sample with one lying within the local hubble flow to determine the ratio of @xmath13 to @xmath7 , and then by using our sample ( the first sne observed in this redshift regime ) together with sn ia absolute magnitude calibrations to determine the value of @xmath7 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath16 has arisen in the context of the observation of peculiar velocity fields ( e.g. , de vaucouleurs 1958 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; lynden - bell et al .",
    "simulations of @xcite have shown that measured hubble constants depend on the observer location and the depth of observations .",
    "previous work by @xcite has constrained deviations from uniform hubble flow to be @xmath17 at @xmath18 using brightest cluster galaxies as a distance indicator .",
    "the same sample of galaxies shows evidence for a peculiar motion of @xmath19 with respect to the cosmic background radiation ( lauer & postman 1994 ) , although @xcite argue that sne ia at similar redshifts do not support this conclusion .",
    "we thus must still examine the possibility of a large scale ( @xmath20 ) peculiar velocity flow affecting all the local @xmath21 measurements .",
    "the supernova cosmology project has discovered over twenty - eight sne in the redshift range @xmath22 in a systematic search ( perlmutter et al . 1994 ; 1995 ) .",
    "the peak magnitudes of these high - redshift candles , when compared with the peak magnitudes of local sne , can yield measurements of the cosmological parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( goobar & perlmutter 1995 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "this calculation implicitly assumes that the local sn calibrators lie within the global cosmological flow ; i.e. , that we do not live in a local bubble where peculiar velocities appreciably bias the observed value of the hubble constant . in this paper",
    "we take an alternative approach , leaving @xmath23 and @xmath24 as free parameters and using our high redshift sne ia to measure the ratio between the locally observed hubble constant and the global hubble constant , @xmath1 .",
    "we also use our sne ia to obtain a measurement of the hubble constant .",
    "this can be compared to the other sn - based measurements which range from @xmath25 ( sandage et al .",
    "1996 ) to @xmath26 ( hamuy et al . 1995 ; riess , press , & kirshner 1996 ) , and to the above mentioned cepheid methods that connect distances in a sequence from a single galaxy , to the core of its cluster , and then to the coma cluster .",
    "we use the first seven sne from our search . a detailed description of our search methodology , the telescopes used , the photometric and spectroscopic data compiled for each event , light curve analysis , and a study of possible systematic uncertainties , are given in perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) .",
    "specifically , we use the redshift as measured from the host galaxy spectrum , the best fit k - corrected @xmath27 peak magnitude after our galaxy extinction correction @xmath28 , the value of @xmath29 ( phillips 1993 ) , and @xmath30 after correction to the leibundgut template @xmath31 using the relation of @xcite as discussed in  2 .",
    "in order to use sne ia as a cosmological candle , we first must calibrate their luminosities .",
    "if the absolute distance to a sn is known , such as from cepheids in the same galaxy , we can obtain the absolute magnitude @xmath32 from the apparent magnitude @xmath33 .",
    "more commonly , we can only measure the redshift and an apparent magnitude . from these quantities",
    "we can obtain the intercept @xmath34 of the magnitude axis of the hubble relationship , @xmath35 .",
    "( following the notation of perlmutter et al .",
    "1996b , the script variable indicates a quantity that can be measured without knowing @xmath21 or the absolute distance . )",
    "these two independent observables are related at low redshifts by the relation @xmath36 , where @xmath21 is in units of @xmath37 .",
    "we call @xmath34 the `` hubble intercept '' magnitude and we use it instead of @xmath32 when studying relative values of the hubble constant .",
    "progress has been made in determining both @xmath32 and @xmath34 using nearby supernovae .",
    "the caln / tololo supernova search has discovered and measured a large sample of sne ia within the local hubble flow , from which a hubble diagram with narrow magnitude dispersion can be produced and the hubble intercept @xmath34 fitted .",
    "the sample includes 18 sne discovered no later than 5 days past maximum with redshifts ranging from @xmath38 .",
    "( of these , half are objects with @xmath39 , beyond the distance of the @xcite galaxy cluster sample .",
    "however , they have magnitudes consistent with the sne ia at lower redshift . ) using these 18 supernovae , @xcite find @xmath40 with rms dispersion @xmath41 mag .",
    "recent advances have led to a more detailed understanding of sne ia .",
    "a correlation between peak magnitude and light - curve shape has been found : @xcite and @xcite parameterize the light curve with the @xmath27-band magnitude difference between peak and 15 days after peak ( @xmath29 ) while riess , press , & kirshner ( 1995a ; 1996 ) characterize the light - curve shape by the amount ( @xmath42 ) of a correction template needed to be added to a @xcite template to get a best @xmath43 fit .",
    "these parameterizations within the type ia class , as well as those involving spectral features ( fisher et al .",
    "1995 ; nugent et al .",
    "1995 ) , may make it possible to use the sne ia as a `` calibrated '' candle with @xmath27 magnitude dispersions of @xmath44 mag .",
    "the @xcite sample gives a linear relation between @xmath29 and the magnitude of the supernova , which can be expressed in terms of the hubble intercept : @xmath45 this relation is used to `` correct '' observed sn magnitudes to a @xmath46 standard template magnitude , @xmath47 .",
    "applying this correction reduces the rms dispersion to @xmath48 mag for the observed range of @xmath29 , between 0.8 and 1.75 mag .",
    "not all sn ia samples show a strong correlation between light - curve shape and peak magnitude . @xcite",
    "cite the apparent lack of such a relation in the cepheid calibrated sne ia to argue for the use of uncorrected `` branch - normal '' sne ia  that is sne with high quality data that pass a simple @xmath49 color selection or have no spectroscopic peculiarities .",
    "this subset of sne ia has a low dispersion in @xmath27 magnitude of @xmath50 mag ( vaughan et al .",
    "we therefore calculate @xmath1 using both light - curve - shape corrected and uncorrected magnitudes .",
    "to measure @xmath1 , we relate the locally derived values of the hubble intercept and the high - redshift observed magnitudes using the standard friedmann - lematre cosmology .",
    "the expected peak magnitude of a sne ia at redshift @xmath51 is a function of the mass density of the universe @xmath23 and the normalized cosmological constant @xmath52 : @xmath53 ( e.g. , peebles 1993 ; goobar & perlmutter 1995 ) where @xmath54 is the k correction relating @xmath27 magnitudes of nearby sne with @xmath55 magnitudes of distant objects ( kim , goobar , & perlmutter 1996 ) and @xmath56 is measured in the local hubble flow .",
    "here we use @xmath57 , the `` hubble - constant - free '' part of the luminosity distance , @xmath58 : @xmath59^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } dz^\\prime \\right ) , \\label{r}\\ ] ] where for @xmath60 , @xmath61 is defined as @xmath62 and @xmath63 ; for @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 as above ; and for @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the speed of light in units of @xmath71 .",
    "we use @xmath72 for uncorrected magnitudes , and @xmath73 from equation  [ hinthamuy ] for light - curve - shape corrected magnitudes .",
    "for the high - redshift corrected sn magnitudes , @xmath74 , we use only the five sne whose light - curve widths lie within the range ( @xmath75 mag ) of the local sne from which the correlation was obtained : sn1994 g , sn1994h , sn1994al , sn1994am , and sn1994an . the full sample of 7 high - redshift sne is used when no correction is applied .    figure  [ fig1](a ) shows the best fit values of @xmath1 and the associated confidence interval curves for a range of @xmath23 in a @xmath6 universe , based on the light - curve - width corrected sn magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig1](b ) is the same plot as figure  [ fig1](a ) but for the case of a flat universe ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "note that the best fit curve is more steeply sloped than for the @xmath6 case , increasing the variation in @xmath1 in this @xmath23 range .",
    "( the same plots for the seven uncorrected magnitudes are almost identical on this scale . ) also plotted for reference are the ratios of representative high and low hubble constant values .",
    "table  [ bounds ] has the single - tailed @xmath5 confidence limits ( c.l . ) for @xmath1 in @xmath6 and flat universes using corrected and uncorrected sn magnitudes .",
    "the lower bounds are calculated at @xmath77 where @xmath1 is a minimum .",
    "the value of @xmath1 increases monotonically with respect to @xmath23 , so to obtain an upper limit we choose an upper bound of @xmath78 .",
    "note that the tabulated numbers are one - tailed @xmath5 c.l .",
    "limits , unlike the two - tailed confidence intervals given in figure  [ fig1 ] .    as a cross check ,",
    "we calculate results for `` branch - normal '' sne ia with uncorrected magnitudes .",
    "only sn1994 g and sn1994an are confirmed `` branch - normal '' based on their color or spectrum and the results obtained from them are statistically consistent with those of the full sample . in a @xmath6 universe , we obtain the limits @xmath79 and @xmath80 , while for a flat universe we obtain @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "generally we can calculate @xmath1 for any @xmath83 pair using equation  [ answer ] ; we have performed this calculation for a grid of points in the plane from @xmath84 and @xmath85 using the five corrected sn magnitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows curves of constant @xmath1 and associated uncertainties on the @xmath83 plane as determined from these calculations . given in parentheses on the same plot",
    "are the @xmath1 values for the same contours based on calculations from all seven uncorrected sn magnitudes .",
    "( the corrected and uncorrected contours do not have the exact same shape in the @xmath86 plane , but their deviations are small within the scale of our plot and in comparison with our error bars . ) within the @xmath86 region plotted , @xmath87 is excluded to @xmath88 confidence .",
    "this limit can still be lower if independent lower limits of the age of the universe and @xmath89 are included .    in @xcite",
    ", we discuss the potential errors due to malmquist bias and host galaxy extinction .",
    "the bounds on those errors are small enough not to affect our results .",
    "the measurement of the global hubble constant @xmath7 , as opposed to the ratio of hubble constants @xmath1 , requires knowledge of the absolute magnitude @xmath32 .",
    "the high resolution of the hubble space telescope has made possible the discovery of cepheids and measurement of their light curves in galaxies that have hosted well - observed sne ia . to date , six galaxy distances have been calculated to determine the peak absolute magnitudes of seven sne , giving a weighted mean of @xmath90 with a dispersion @xmath91 mag ( sandage et al .",
    "1996 ; saha et al . 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "six of the seven sne have a @xmath29 measurement from which we calculate the weighted mean of the peak absolute magnitude of sne ia corrected to @xmath46 mag . using the @xmath29 vs. magnitude relation of equation  [ hinthamuy ]",
    ", we find @xmath92 with @xmath93 mag .    there is some debate on whether these sne have been properly extinction - corrected and weighted .",
    "for example , @xcite use the correction template method to conclude that sn1972e is significantly extinguished by its host galaxy .",
    "it has also been noted that the sne measured with photographic plates give magnitudes that are systematically brighter than ones measured photoelectrically .",
    "therefore , although we use all seven ( six for the @xmath29 corrected ) sne for our main results , we include for comparison results from the @xcite analysis of the three sne with photoelectric data that yields @xmath94 for a @xmath95 leibundgut template supernova .    inserting the absolute magnitude @xmath90 and the @xmath29corrected absolute magnitude @xmath92 into equation  [ answer2 ] , we obtain useful upper bounds of the `` global '' hubble constant @xmath7 , which are listed in table  [ bounds ] .",
    "the bounds are calculated at @xmath77 for @xmath6 universes and flat universes because @xmath7 decreases with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "if we take @xmath8 we obtain even tighter limits , also given in table  [ bounds ] .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows @xmath7 in the most general case , for different values of @xmath23 and @xmath89 .",
    "note that a value of @xmath21 as high as @xmath96 is only found for large values of @xmath89 and low @xmath23 . as a cross check , we again calculate our results for uncorrected `` branch - normal '' supernovae .",
    "we then find @xmath97 in a @xmath6 universe and @xmath98 in a flat universe .",
    "the measurement of cosmological distances using high - redshift sne with locally - calibrated standard candles sets a limit on the differences between the local and global hubble constants . from our analysis , it is clear that these data are inconsistent with scenarios that use a local bubble with high @xmath13 that differs greatly from @xmath7 .",
    "we also obtain an upper limit for the hubble constant that is consistent with many of the other current measurements .",
    "however , limits that disagree with higher @xmath7 measurements may be obtained with independent upper limits on @xmath89 .",
    "the sn ia absolute magnitude calibrations are still subject to debate and may have systematic errors larger than the statistical ones given above , so it is important to ask how robust our results are .",
    "an uncertainty in the absolute calibration @xmath99 in magnitudes propagates into @xmath100 . a 0.09 mag difference in the magnitude calibrations , such as the one between the @xmath29-corrected absolute magnitudes for six sne , @xmath92 , and that of @xcite , @xmath94",
    ", will produce a @xmath101 change in either @xmath7 or @xmath1 .",
    "there is little difference between magnitude corrected and uncorrected results for the ratio @xmath1 , but there is a systematic difference for @xmath7 itself , as seen in table  [ bounds ] .",
    "this is because both the light - curve - width distribution and the width - magnitude relation of our high - redshift sample are similar to the distribution and relation of the @xcite sample but not to those of the @xcite sample .",
    "although these differences may be due to selection effects , the small number statistics of the cepheid - calibrated sn sample can also produce fluctuations that account for the differences .    in @xcite we calculated @xmath23 and @xmath89 setting @xmath13 equal to @xmath7 ,",
    "whereas in this paper we have discussed the measurement of @xmath1 while leaving @xmath23 and @xmath89 as free parameters .",
    "ideally one would like to measure both sets of quantities simultaneously .",
    "( this problem has been discussed in wu , qin , & fang 1996 . )",
    "filling in a hubble diagram with measurements of spatially well - distributed sne should make it possible to decouple local and global streaming motions by showing redshift dependent deviations from the standard model , and allow one to measure @xmath23 and @xmath89 independently of local peculiar flows . using sne from redshift regimes with no evidence of flows",
    ", we can simultaneously fit @xmath7 , @xmath23 , and @xmath89 using equation  [ answer2 ] , thus producing a measurement of the hubble constant .",
    "our current data set , which spans from @xmath102 , shows no sign of peculiar flows but needs higher statistics and more complete spatial coverage to confirm this result .",
