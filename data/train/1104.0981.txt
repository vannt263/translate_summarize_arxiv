    "it is well established that the nuclei of active galaxies exhibit a broad range of luminosities , from the most energetic quasars to more modest seyferts .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with nuclear x - ray luminosities below @xmath710@xmath9 erg s@xmath6 are classified as low luminosity agns ( llagns ; koratkar et al .",
    "1995 ) , and are the most common variety of agn observed in the local universe .",
    "about 30% of all nearby bright galaxies exhibit llagn activity , and many additionally host low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; ho et al .",
    "many recent studies have successfully linked liners to agn activity ; for example , the detections of x - ray cores ( dudik et al . 2005 ; flohic et al . 2006 ; gonzlez - martn et al .",

    "2004 ) are all indicative of an accreting black hole ( bh ) energy source . at low nuclear luminosities ,",
    "however , several alternative explanations for the power source have been investigated , such as circumnuclear starbursts ( gonzales delgado et al .",
    "2004 ; colina et al .",
    "2002 ) , shock heating by supernovae ( sne ) in a high - density environment ( alonso - herrero et al . 2000 ; olsson et al . 2007 ) , and photoionization by very hot o stars ( terashima et al .",
    "moreover , a number of studies of the seds of weak agns in liners find that the agn does not produce enough photons to power the emission lines ( e.g. , ho 2008 ; eracleous et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) .    at a distance of 3.1 mpc ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2004 ) , ngc 404 is the nearest s0 type galaxy to the milky way and the closest galactic nucleus to be classified as a liner by ho",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) . while the observed nuclear x - ray luminosity is low , only a few times 10@xmath10 erg s@xmath6 ( eracleous et al .",
    "2002 ) , the presence of a llagn in ngc 404 remains ambiguous .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is consistent with that of a single high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) or a giant star - forming region such as 30 doradus ( wang & helfand 1991 ) , and the soft x - ray emission is consistent with a hot gas origin , potentially blown out by a compact starburst or sne .",
    "no radio core has been observed at 15 ghz ( to a limiting flux of 1.4 mjy ; nagar et al .",

    "a compact x - ray source was previously detected in the central region of ngc 404 ( lira et al . 2000 ; eracleous et al . 2002 ) , but its low luminosity and soft thermal spectrum indicate a possible starburst event origin .",
    "mid - ir observations of the ngc 404 nuclear region show high ionization lines consistent with agns ( satyapal et al .",
    "2004 ) ; however , the [ ne v ] lines ( a more reliable indicator of agn activity ) are not detected ( abel & satyapal 2008 ) .    additionally , optical _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) observations show h@xmath2 emission occurring in both a compact source @xmath1116 north of the nucleus and in structures reminiscient of supernova remnants ( pogge et al . 2000 ) , and [ o iii ] emission originates from a double - lobed structure along the major axis of the galaxy ( plana et al .",
    "1998 ) with a higher velocity dispersion than the central h@xmath2 emission ( bouchard et al . 2010 ) .",
    "while the uv spectrum of the nucleus reveals signatures of o stars , the dilution of the lines suggest that @xmath760% of the uv flux may originate from a nonthermal source ( maoz et al .",
    "1998 ) . the observed level of uv variability ( the uv emission declined by a factor of 3 between 1993 and 2002 ; maoz et al .",

    "2009 ) , independent of the host galaxy morphology ( bker et al . 2002 ; carollo et al . 1997 ; ct et al .",
    "2006 ) , and are considered to be the foundation of circumnuclear starbursts and supernovae that could drive liner activity ( meurer et al . 1995 ; tremonti et al .",
    "2001 ; chandar et al . 2005 ) . however , if ngc 404 is dominated by star formation , the rate is exceptionally low , with only two to six o stars being sufficient to explain the observed luminosity ( del ro et al . 2004 ) .",

    "we find the 0.3 - 8 kev background count rate to be low , @xmath75@xmath22 ct s@xmath6 arcsec@xmath23 , throughout the observation .",
    "we additionally obtained two archival _ chandra _ acis - s observations of ngc 404 from 2000 aug 30 ( 2 ks ) and 1999 dec 19 - 20 ( 24 ks ) .",
    "these observations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "all observations were reduced using the x - ray data analysis package ciao version 4.3 and using standard reduction procedures .",
    "we created exposure maps for the images using the ciao script ` merge_all ` .",
    "point sources , including the ngc 404 nucleus , were identified using the ciao task ` wavdetect ` .",
    "we compared our x - ray point source detections to a 3.6@xmath24 _ spitzer _ irac image of ngc 404 ( aligned with the usno - b1.0 star catalog ) and find one x - ray source other than the ngc 404 nucleus to be coincident with a likely ir counterpart ( with a positional offset of 0.@xmath81 ) , although this source is not a confirmed x - ray emitting object .",
    "we additionally searched for potential optical counterparts using optical observations in the hubble legacy archive , but were unable to unambiguously identify any optical sources within the hst field of view coincident with our x - ray point sources .",
    "we thus conclude that our residual systematic uncertainty in absolute pointing is conservatively 0.@xmath84 .",
    "all spectra were extracted using ` psextract ` , and spectral fitting was performed in ` xspec ` ( arnaud 1996 ) v.12.6.0q , and spectral models were fit to the unbinned spectra ( binned spectra are shown for display purposes only ) .",

    "errors correspond to the 90% confidence level .",
    "in addition to reporting the @xmath29-statistic and degrees of freedom ( @xmath31 ) for each model , we used the ` xspec ` task _ goodness _ to perform monte carlo simulations of the spectra using each best - fit model .",
    "the procedure returns the percentage of the simulated spectra that had a fit statistic less than that obtained from the fit to the real data .",
    "a value of 50% indicates the best - fitting model is a good representation of the data ; values much less than this indicate that the data are overparameterized by the model ( i.e. , random statistical fluctuations in the majority of simulated spectra are not able to produce a fit statistic as low as that obtained from the real data ) , and values much higher than this indicate the model is a poor fit to the data ( i.e. , a large majority of simulated spectra have a fit statistic less than that obtained from the real data ) .",

    "the adaptively smoothed 0.3 - 1 kev and 2 - 7 kev images , with contours superimposed , are shown in figure 2 to emphasize the compact nature of the hard central source .",
    "we next used the smoothed soft and hard energy images to construct a hardness ratio map of the ngc 404 nuclear region ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we define a hardness ratio hr = ( hard - soft)/(hard+soft ) ; dark areas in the hardness ratio map correspond to softer x - ray emission , while light regions indicate hard emission .",
    "there is clearly a point - like region of hard emission , coincident with the location of the nsc , surrounded by an extended area of predominantly soft x - ray emission .    in figure 4 , we show a h@xmath2-@xmath34 color map of the ngc 404 nuclear region ( seth et al .",

    "we estimate the eddington ratio for both scenarios ( assuming a 10 @xmath1xrb and a 10@xmath72 @xmath1agn ) and compare our best - fit photon index @xmath3of the hard nuclear point source to the observed trends with @xmath50 for both xrbs and llagn .",
    "we find the ngc 404 x - ray spectral shape and luminosity to be consistent with observed llagns , and inconsistent with observed xrbs .",
    "we therefore favor the scenario in which the ngc 404 nucleus is powered by an imbh , with a mass on the order of @xmath0 @xmath1as dynamically estimated by seth et al .",
    "such a weak agn does not produce a sufficient quantity of ionizing photons necessary to power a liner  we therefore conclude that the liner in ngc 404 is powered by stellar processes",

    "additional , multiwavelength observations of the ngc 404 nucleus are required to robustly determine the mass of the cental bh  for example , resolved stellar populations within the nucleus would enable a robust dynamical mass determination , and a radio detection of the compact source would verify the location of ngc 404 on the fundamental plane of bh activity .",

    "<S> chandra _ observation of the ngc 404 nuclear region . the long exposure and excellent spatial resolution of _ chandra _ has enabled us to critically examine the nuclear environment of ngc 404 , which is known to host a nuclear star cluster and potentially an intermediate - mass black hole ( on the order of a few times @xmath0 @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find two distinct x - ray sources : a hard , central point source coincident with the optical and radio centers of the galaxy , and a soft extended region that is coincident with areas of high h@xmath2 emission and likely recent star formation . </S>",
    "<S> when we fit the 0.3 - 8 kev spectra of each region separately , we find the hard nuclear point source to be dominated by a power law ( @xmath3= 1.88 ) , while the soft off - nuclear region is best fit by a thermal plasma model ( @xmath4 = 0.67 kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore find evidence for both a power law component and hot gas in the nuclear region of ngc 404 . </S>",

    "<S> a low level of diffuse x - ray emission was detected out to @xmath715@xmath8(@xmath70.2 kpc ) from the nucleus . </S>",
