    "the investigation of rotating gases or liquids is a central issue in the theory of superfluidity @xcite since rotation can lead to the formation of quantized vortices which order into a vortex array , in close analogy with the behaviour of superfluid helium . under conditions of rapid rotation ,",
    "when the vortex density becomes large , atomic bose gases offer the possibility to explore the physics of quantized vortices in novel parameter regimes . during recent years",
    ", there have been advances in experimental discoveries @xcite of rotating ultra - cold atomic bose gases , and these developments have been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies mainly make use of the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation to describe the main features of the vortex states @xcite , and several predictions @xcite have been shown to agree with experiments @xcite .",
    "some of the important studies were concerned with the equilibrium properties of a single vortex , including its structures and dynamics @xcite , the critical frequency and the nonlinear dynamics of vortex lattice formation @xcite .",
    "a multi - quantum vortex is typically dynamically unstable in harmonically trapped bec predicted by several theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "the splitting instability in case of multi - quantum vortices shows that the vortex will split into single quantum vortices even in the absence of dissipation due to the peculiar feature of nonlinear dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of a plug potential @xcite or an anharmonic trapping potential @xcite , various studies have addressed different means to stabilize multi - quantum vortices in rotating bec .",
    "for example , when the confining potential is steeper than harmonic potential in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation , multi - quantum vortices are energetically favorable if the interaction is weak enough .",
    "for stronger interactions , the multiply quantized vortices break up into arrays of several vortices .",
    "in addition , interestingly , stable multi - quantum vortices have also been found to exist in two - component bec ruostekoski - pra-2004 , which can be adjusted near feshbach resonance through spatial inhomogeneous external magnetic field @xmath0 i.e. @xmath1 .",
    "mathematically , the gp equation , to be written explicitly , is an equation of nonlinear schrdinger type sulem , belmonte - beitia1,wang , belmonte - beitia2,wu , yan_konotop , kasamatsu .",
    "this equation has been studied extensively both in the physical and mathematical literature , since they provide a universal model for a study of the dynamics of the envelope waves .",
    "one of the distinctive features of the equation as it appears in bec problems is the presence of an external trapping potential , which essentially affects the elementary excitation spectrum .",
    "most properties of the bec are significantly affected by the interatomic interaction , which can be characterized by the @xmath2-wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated that both amplitude and sign of the scattering length can be modified by utilizing the feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "this technique provides a very promising method for the manipulation of atomic matter waves and the nonlinear excitations in bec by tuning the interatomic interaction . by using this technique",
    ", one can study atomic matter waves and the nonlinear excitations in bec for the case of the gp equations with the time- and space - dependent nonlinearity coefficients belmonte - beitia1,wang , belmonte - beitia2,wu .",
    "motivated by stabilizing multiple vortex states and understanding the behavior of nonlinear excitation in physical systems , we perform theoretical analysis and numerical studies of the quantized vortices in a rotating bec with spatiotemporally modulated interaction in harmonic and anharmonic potentials , respectively .",
    "compared with the former work on quantized vortices , we find that a new series of exact single and multiple vortex states ( defined by radial and angular quantum numbers ) can be supported by the spatiotemporally modulated interaction in a rotating bec . in particular , our results have provided a very promising method for stabilizing the vortex having very large topological charge @xmath3 , which has been conjectured unstable @xcite by tuning the external potential and nonlinear interaction simultaneously in time .",
    "at zero temperature , the quantum and thermal fluctuations are negligible so that a bec trapped in an external potential can be described by a macroscopic wave function \" @xmath4 obeying the gp equation . in the rotating frame with rotating frequency @xmath5 around the @xmath6-axis ,",
    "the gp equation in cylindrical coordinate reads ueda    @xmath7    where @xmath8 with @xmath9 @xmath10 is the atom mass , @xmath11 is the azimuthal angel , the wave function is normalized by the total particle number @xmath12 @xmath13 is an external trapping potential , and @xmath14 represents the strength of interatomic interaction characterized by the @xmath2-wave scattering length @xmath15 , which can be adjusted experimentally by an inhomogeneous external magnetic field @xmath16 in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "the trapping potential can be assumed to be @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the confinement frequencies in the radial and axial directions , respectively , and in particular , the radial confinement frequency @xmath20 is assumed to be time - dependent as in @xcite . in the following , we consider the atoms in the @xmath21 hyperfine state of @xmath22li and @xmath21 hyperfine state of @xmath23rb trapped in a very thin disc - shaped potential , i.e.",
    ", the trapping potential in the radial direction is much weaker than that in the axial direction as @xmath24 , such that the motion of atoms in the @xmath6 direction is essentially frozen to the ground state @xmath25 of the axial harmonic trapping potential .",
    "then we can separate the wave function as @xmath26 to derive the 2d gp equation @xmath27 with @xmath28 introducing the scales characterizing the trapping potential , the length , time , and wave function are scaled as @xmath29 respectively , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a constant length chosen to measure the @xmath2-wave scattering length .",
