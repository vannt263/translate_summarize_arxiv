    "the internet is a capital example of growing complex network @xcite interconnecting millions of computers around the world .",
    "growing networks exhibit a high degree of wiring entanglement which takes place during their dynamical evolution .",
    "this feature , at the heart of the new and interesting topological properties recently observed in growing network systems @xcite , has triggered the attention of the research community to the study of the large - scale properties of router - level maps of the internet @xcite .",
    "the statistical analysis performed so far has focused on several quantities exhibiting non - trivial properties : wiring redundancy and clustering , @xcite , the distribution of chemical distances @xcite , and the eigenvalue spectra of the connectivity matrix @xcite .",
    "noteworthy , the presence of a power - law connectivity distribution @xcite makes the internet an example of the recently identified class of scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "this evidence implies the absence of any characteristic connectivity  large connectivity fluctuations  and a high heterogeneity of the network structure .",
    "as widely pointed out in the literature  @xcite , a deeper empirical understanding of the topological properties of internet is fundamental in the developing of realistic internet map generators , that on their turn are used to test and optimize internet protocols .",
    "in fact , the internet topology has a great influence on the dynamics that data traffic carries out on top of it .",
    "hence , a better understanding of the internet structure is of primary importance in the design of new routing @xcite and searching algorithms @xcite , and to protect from virus spreading @xcite and node failures @xcite .",
    "in this perspective , the direct measurement and statistical characterization of real internet maps are of crucial importance in the identification of the basic mechanisms that rule the internet structure and dynamics .    in this work , we shall consider the evolution of real internet maps from 1997 to 2000 , collected by the national laboratory for applied network research ( nlanr ) @xcite , in order to study the underlying dynamical processes leading to the internet structure and topology .",
    "we provide a statistical analysis of several average properties .",
    "in particular , we consider the average connectivity , clustering coefficient , chemical distance , and betweenness .",
    "these quantities will provide a preliminary test of the stationarity of the network .",
    "the scale - free nature of the internet has been pointed out by inspecting the connectivity probability distribution , and it implies that the fluctuations around the average connectivity are not bounded . in order to provide a full characterization of the scale - free properties of the internet , we analyze the connectivity and betweenness probability distributions for different time snapshot of the internet maps .",
    "we observe that these distributions exhibit an algebraic behavior and are characterized by scaling exponents which are stationary in time .",
    "the chemical distance between pairs of nodes , on the other hand , appears to be sharply peaked around its average value , providing a striking evidence for the presence of well - defined small - world properties @xcite .",
    "a more detailed picture of the internet can be achieved by studying higher order correlation functions of the network . in this sense",
    ", we show that the internet hierarchical structure is reflected in non - trivial scale - free betweenness and connectivity correlation functions .",
    "finally , we study several quantities related to the growth dynamics of the network .",
    "the analysis points out the presence of two distinct wiring processes : the first concerns newly added nodes , while the second is related to already existing nodes increasing their interconnections .",
    "we confirm that newly added nodes establish new links with the linear preferential attachment rule often used in modeling growing networks @xcite .",
    "in addition , a study of the connectivity evolution of a single node shows a rich dynamical behavior with aging properties .",
    "the present study could provide some hints for a more realistic modeling of the internet evolution , and with this purpose in mind we provide a discussion of some of the existing growing network models in the light of our findings .",
    "a short account of these results appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : map ] we describe the internet maps used in our study .",
    "[ sec : ave ] is devoted to the study of average quantities as a function of time . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sta ] we provide the analysis of the statistical distributions characterizing the internet topology .",
    "we obtain evidence for the scale - free nature of this network as well as for the stationarity in time of this property . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hie ] we characterize the hierarchical structure of the internet by the statistical analysis of the betweenness and connectivity correlation functions .",
    "[ sec : dyn ] reports the study of dynamical properties such as the preferential attachment and the evolution of the average connectivity of newly added nodes .",
    "these properties , which show aging features , are the basis for the developing of internet dynamical models .",
    "[ sec : model ] is devoted to a detailed discussion of some internet models as compared with the presented real data analysis . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] we draw our conclusions and perspectives .",
    "several internet mapping projects are currently devoted to obtain high - quality router - level maps of the internet . in most cases ,",
    "the map is constructed by using a hop - limited probe ( such as the unix _ traceroute _ tool ) from a single location in the network . in this case",
    "the result is a `` directed '' , map as seen from a specific location on the internet @xcite .",
    "this approach does not correspond to a complete map of the internet because cross - links and other technical problems ( such as multiple internet provider aliases ) are not considered .",
    "heuristic methods to take into account these problems have been proposed ( see for instance ref .",
    "however , it is not clear their reliability and the corresponding completeness of the maps constructed this way .",
    "a different representation of internet is obtained by mapping the autonomous systems ( as ) topology .",
    "the internet can be considered as a collection of subnetworks that are connected together . within each subnetwork",
    "the information is routed using an internal algorithm that may differ from one subnetwork to another .",
    "thus , each subnet is an independent unit of the internet and it is often referred as an as .",
    "these as communicate between them using a specific routing algorithm , the border gateway protocol .",
    "each as number approximately maps to an internet service provider ( isp ) and their links are inter - isp connections . in this case",
    "it is possible to collect data from several probing stations to obtain complete interconnectivity maps ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a technical description of these projects ) .",
    "in particular , the nlanr project is collecting data since nov .",
    "1997 , and it provides topological as well as dynamical information on a consistent subset of the internet . the first nov .",
    "1997 map contains 3180 as , and it has grown in time until the dec .",
    "1999 measurement , consisting of 6374 as . in the following",
    "we will consider the graph whose nodes represent the as and whose links represent the adjacencies ( interconnections ) between as . in particular we will focus in three different snapshots corresponding to november 8th 1997 , 1998 , and 1999 , that will be referenced as as97 , as98 , and as99 , respectively .",
    "the nlanr connectivity maps are collected with a resolution of one day and are changing from day to day .",
    "these changes are due to the addition ( birth ) and deletion ( death ) of nodes and links , but also to the flickering of connections , so that a node may appear to be isolated ( not mapped ) from time to time .",
    "a simple test , however , shows that flickering is appreciable just in nodes with low connectivity .",
    "we compute the ratio @xmath0 between the number of days in which a node is observed in the nlanr maps and the total number of days after the first appearance of the node , averaged over all nodes in the maps .",
    "the analysis reveals that @xmath1 and @xmath2 for nodes with connectivity @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "hence , nodes with @xmath4 have fluctuations that must be taken into account . in order to shed light on this point",
    ", we inspect the incidence of death events with respect to the creation of new nodes .",
    "we consider a death event only if a node is not observed in the map during a one year time interval . in table",
    "[ tab:0 ] we show the total number of death events in a year , for 1997 , 1998 , and 1999 , in comparison with the total number of new nodes created .",
    "it can be seen that the as s birth rate appears to be larger by a factor of two than the death rate .",
    "more interestingly , if we restrict the analysis to nodes with connectivity @xmath5 , the death rate is reduced to a few percent of the birth rate .",
    "this clearly indicates that only poorly connected nodes have an appreciable probability to disappear .",
    "this fact is easily understandable in terms of the market competition among isp s , where small newcomers are the ones which more likely go out of business .",
    ".total number of new ( @xmath6 ) and deleted ( @xmath7 ) nodes in the years 1997 , 1998 , and 1999 .",
    "we also report the number of deleted nodes with connectivity @xmath5 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have performed simulations of these three models using the parameters mentioned above and using sizes of @xmath8 nodes , in analogy with the size of the as map analyzed . in each case",
    "we perform averages over @xmath9 different realizations of the networks .",
    "it is worth remarking that while the fitness model generates a connected network , both the gba and the mr model yield disconnected networks .",
    "this is due to the rewiring process in the gba model , while the disconnect nature of the graph in the mr model is an inherent consequence of the connectivity exponent being larger that @xmath10 @xcite . in these two cases we therefore work with graphs whose giant component ( that is",
    ", the largest cluster of connected nodes in the network @xcite ) has a size of the order @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to remind the reader that we are working with networks of a relatively small size , chosen so as to fit the size of the internet maps analyzed in the previous sections .",
    "in this perspective , all the numerical analysis that we shall perform in the following serve only to check the validity of the models as representations of the internet as we know it , and do not refer to the intrinsic properties of the models in the thermodynamic limit @xmath12 .",
    "as a first check of the connectivity properties of the models , in fig  [ fig : m0 ] we have plotted the integrated connectivity distributions . for the mr model we recover the expected exponent @xmath13 , since it was imposed in the very definition of the model . for the gba model we obtain numerically @xmath14 for the giant component , in excellent agreement with the value predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaba ] ) for the asymptotic network . for the fitness model , on the other hand , a numerical regression of the integrated connectivity distribution yields an effective exponent @xmath15 .",
    "this value is larger than the theoretical prediction @xmath16 obtained for the model  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is mainly due to the logarithmic corrections present in the connectivity distribution of this model .",
    "these corrections are more evident in the relatively small - sized networks used in this work and become progressively smaller for larger network sizes .    in table  [ tab:3 ]",
    "we report the average values of the connectivity , clustering coefficient , chemical distance , and betweenness for the three models , compared with the respective values computed for internet during 1998 . from the examination of this table",
    ", one could surprisingly conclude that the mr model , which neglects by constructions any correlation among nodes , yields the average values in better agreement with the internet data .",
    "as we can observe , the fitness model provides a too small value for the average clustering coefficient , while the gba model clearly fails for the average chemical distance and the betweenness .",
    "a more crucial test about the models is however provided by the analysis of the full distribution of the various quantities , that should reproduce the scale - free features of the real internet .",
    "the betweenness distribution @xmath17 of the three models give qualitatively similar results .",
    "the integrated betweenness distribution @xmath18 obtained is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1](a ) . both the mr and the fitness models follow a power - law decay @xmath19 with an exponent @xmath20 , in agreement with the value obtained from the as maps .",
    "the gba model shows an appreciable bending which , nevertheless , is compatible with the experimental internet behavior .",
    "these results are in agreement with the numerical prediction in ref .",
    "@xcite and support the conjecture that the exponent @xmath21 is a universal quantity in all scale - free networks with @xmath22 . in order to further inspect the betweenness properties , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1](b ) the average betweenness @xmath23 as a function of the connectivity .",
    "in this case , the mr and gba models yield an exponent @xmath24 , compatible with the as maps , while the fitness model exhibits a somewhat larger exponent , close to @xmath25 . also in this case , we have that the finite size logarithmic corrections present in the fitness model could play a determinant role in this discrepancy .",
    "while properties related to the betweenness do not appear to pinpoint a major difference among the models , the most striking test is provided by analyzing the correlation properties of the models . in figs .",
    "[ fig : m2 ] and  [ fig : m3 ] , we report the average clustering coefficient as a function of the connectivity , @xmath26 , and the average connectivity of the neighbors , @xmath27 , respectively . the data from internet maps show a nontrivial @xmath28 structure that , as discussed in previous sections , is due to scale - free correlation properties among nodes .",
    "these properties depend on their turn upon the underlying hierarchy of the internet structure .",
    "the only model that renders results in qualitative agreement with the internet maps is the fitness model . on the contrary ,",
    "the mr and gba models completely fail , producing quantities which are almost independent on @xmath28 .",
    "the reason of this striking difference can be traced back to the lack of correlations among nodes , which in the mr model is imposed by construction ( the model is a random network with fixed connectivity distribution ) , and in the gba model it is due to the destruction of correlations by the random rewiring mechanism implemented .",
    "the general analytic study of connectivity correlations in growing networks models can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it is worth noticing that a @xmath28-structure in correlation functions , as probed by the quantity @xmath29 , does not arise in all growing network models . in this perspective",
    "we can use correlation properties as one of the discriminating feature among various models that show the same scale - free connectivity exponent .",
    "the fitness model is able to reproduce the non trivial correlation properties because of the fitness parameter of each node that mimics the different hierarchical , economical , and geographical constraints of the internet growth .",
    "since the model is embedding many features in one single parameter , we have to consider it just as a very first step towards a more realistic modeling of the internet . in this perspective",
    ", models in which the attachment rate depends on both the connectivity and the real space distance between two nodes has been studied in @xcite .",
    "these models seem to give a better description of the internet topology .",
    "in particular , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , includes geographical constraints , obtaining that , on average , the probability to connect to a given node scales linearly with its connectivity and it is inversely proportional to the distance to that node .",
    "a comparison with real data is , in this case , more difficult because internet maps generally lack geographical and economical information .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the internet maps exhibit a stationary scale - free topology , characterized by non - trivial connectivity correlations .",
    "an investigation of the internet dynamics confirms the presence of a preferential attachment behaving linearly with the nodes connectivity and identifies two different dynamical regimes during the nodes evolution .",
    "we have compared several models of scale - free networks to the experimental data obtained from the as maps . while all the models seem to capture the scale - free connectivity distribution , correlation and clustering properties",
    "are captured only in models that take into account several other ingredients , such as the nodes hierarchy , resource constraints and geographical location .",
    "other ingredients that should be included in the internet modeling concern the possibility of including the wiring among existing nodes and age effects that our analysis show to be an appreciable feature of the internet evolution .",
    "the results presented in this work show that the understanding and modeling of internet is an interesting and stimulating problem that need the cooperative efforts of data analysis and theoretical modeling .    this work has been partially supported by the european network contract no .",
