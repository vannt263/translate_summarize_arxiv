    "helioseismology has revealed that the rotation regime in the sun changes abruptly from latitude dependent in the convection zone to almost uniform in the radiation zone below .",
    "the top of the radiation zone is thus a region of strong vertical shear , and for this reason that layer has been called the tachocline ( spiegel & zahn 1992 ) .",
    "acoustic sounding has shown also that some mild macroscopic mixing occurs in this region , to smoothen the composition gradient which , with microscopic diffusion only , would be somewhat steeper . moreover ,",
    "the li depletion observed in solar - type stars can only be explained by some type of macroscopic transport between the convection zone and the depth where this fragile element is destroyed .    among the possible mechanisms which may produce such mixing",
    ", a plausible one is the shear instability induced by the vertical rotation profile . in the present note",
    "we shall verify whether this instability is able to play an effective role in the observed mixing .",
    "through the inversion of lowl frequency - splitting data spanning 2 years , charbonneau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have derived the following internal solar rotation rate for @xmath1 : @xmath2 \\left(\\omega_{\\rm s}(\\theta)-\\omega_{\\rm c}\\right).\\ ] ] the observed latidinal differential rotation @xmath3 is expressed as : @xmath4 the parameters values are : @xmath5nhz , @xmath6nhz , @xmath7nhz , @xmath8nhz ; @xmath9 is the radius at the bottom of the solar convective zone and @xmath10 the tachocline thickness .",
    "similar expressions can be found in the litterature e.g. li & wilson ( @xcite ) , corbard et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , antia et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath11 is almost constant at greater depth is in conflict with earlier predictions of a faster rotating core ( pinsonneault et al .",
    "@xcite ; zahn @xcite ) , and it rules out that angular momemtum be transported vertically through shear - induced turbulence . but",
    "this possibility still exists in the shear flow of the tachocline .",
    "in a stellar radiation zone , the stable stratification of entropy tends to inhibit any instability arising from a vertical shear @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the amplitude of the horizontal velocity and @xmath14 the vertical coordinate . in the adiabatic limit , i.e. when",
    "radiative losses are negligible , the shear instability is suppressed whenever : @xmath15 the strength of the stratification is measured by the brunt - visl frequency @xmath16 : @xmath17 with the usual notations for the gravity @xmath18 , the pressure scale height @xmath19 , the logarithmic temperature gradients @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 being pressure , density and temperature .",
    "the critical richardson number @xmath25 is of order unity for typical flow profiles ; in the following we shall take @xmath26 .",
    "however shear turbulence may still arise , and be sustained , provided that sufficient heat is lost by the turbulent eddies to lower their buyoancy .",
    "whether this occurs is determined by the pclet number characterizing these eddies : @xmath27 in this expression @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the velocity and the size of turbulent elements and @xmath30 the thermal diffusivity : @xmath31 @xmath32 is the stefan constant , @xmath33 the rosseland mean opacity and @xmath34 the first adiabatic exponent .",
    "when @xmath35 the richardson criterion takes the modified form ( dudis @xcite ; zahn @xcite ) : @xmath36 from which one infers what are the largest turbulent scales that can survive in a stratified shear flow .",
    "however turbulence will be maintained only if the turnover rate of the eddies is faster than their viscous decay rate : @xmath37",
    "@xmath38 is the viscosity .",
    "this critical reynolds number @xmath39 is smaller than the classical one which governs the onset of instability in a shear flow whose velocity varies by @xmath40 between two boundaries separated by the distance @xmath41 , namely @xmath42 .",
    "the reason is of course that @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    for the value of this @xmath39 we turn to an experiment performed by stillinger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who measured the size of the turbulent motions downstream a flow traversing a grid .",
    "the size of the smallest turbulent eddies was found to be @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the classical kolmogorov length , with @xmath47 being the energy injection rate per unit mass . in the inertial cascade",
    "the velocities scale as @xmath48 , and therefore : @xmath49 from which we draw the critical reynolds number in that experiment : @xmath50 , a value we shall adopt for the present purpose .    the conditions ( [ eq : richmod ] ) and ( [ eq : rey ] ) can be simultaneously fulfilled when : @xmath51",
    "let us now examine where the instability condition ( [ eq : inst ] ) is fulfilled is the sun . according to ( [ eq : rot ] )",
    ", the maximum shear rate at the top of the solar radiation zone amounts to @xmath52 as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : dv ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the non - dimensioned parameter @xmath53 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : inst ] ) , the turbulent shear instability will occur if : @xmath54 note that @xmath55 , the ratio of reynolds and richardson critical numbers , is rather uncertain , in particular because @xmath25 depends on the vertical flow profile .",
    "we have calculated @xmath56 as a function of radius and colatitude in the radiative zone beneath the tachocline of a standard solar model , in order to delimit the regions where the turbulent instability is established .",
    "the standard solar model is computed with cesam code ( morel @xcite ) ; the evolution includes the pre main - sequence phase . basically , the physics and calibration parameters are the same as in morel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; it uses opal opacities and equation of state , the microscopic diffusion coefficients of michaud & proffitt  ( @xcite ) and the recently updated thermonuclear reaction rates of the european compilation nacre ( angulo et al .",
    "the angular velocity beneath the convection zone is derived from eq .",
    "[ eq : rot ] .",
    "the dynamical viscosity is taken as in a fully ionized hydrogen plasma .",
    "figure  [ fig : xi ] shows @xmath57 as a function of radius for three colatitude values . according to the eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) criterion , the turbulent instability may occur at the equator ( @xmath58 ) in the interval @xmath59 ; the turbulent layer is thinner at higher latitudes . in other words , the unstable region for the vertical shear instability , beneath the convection zone",
    ", measures barely 2 percent of the solar radius and is localized around the equator .",
    "this instability should not be confused with the shear instability arising from the differential rotation in latitude , which is not inhibited by the vertical stratification , and which may play an important role in smoothing horizontal gradients in composition and angular velocity ( spiegel & zahn @xcite ) .",
    "but that instability does not contribute to the vertical transport .",
    "we conclude that another physical process is needed to transport matter and angular momentum beneath the solar tachocline , which would operate more efficiently than the turbulence generated by the vertical @xmath60-gradient .",
    "a plausible mechanism is the meridional circulation which probably exists in the tachocline ( brun et al .",
    "a more powerful process is required also to establish the almost uniform angular velocity at greater depth , which could be magnetic torquing ( gough & mcintyre 1998 ) or transport of angular momentum by waves ( schatzman 1996 ; kumar et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
