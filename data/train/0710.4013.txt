    "in a class of materials often referred to as correlated materials , the electronic structure is characterized by a set of partially filled narrow bands across the fermi level .",
    "seen from the atomic site , one has a set of partially filled shell of localized orbitals typically of 3d or 4f character .",
    "many of the electronic properties of the material are determined by the correlations among the localized electrons living in the partially filled band or shell .",
    "it is therefore physically well motivated to map the original complicated many - electron problem to a model consisting of the localized orbitals and a few additional orbitals . by eliminating the high - energy states ( `` downfolding '' )",
    "the long - range bare coulomb interaction is screened to a short - range interaction at low energy .",
    "since the screened interaction is short range , only on - site interaction or the hubbard _ u _ is often taken into consideration in the model .",
    "this is the physical idea behind the well - known hubbard model or andersen impurity model .",
    "one would then wish to have a set of well localized orbitals or wannier orbitals that span the same hilbert space as that of the states that form the narrow bands . in this way",
    "the hubbard _ u _ will have small off - site matrix elements , which may be neglected .",
    "practical procedures to construct the models starting from first - principles calculations have been a subject of interest for a long time @xcite .    in this work , we focus on wannier orbitals using the method developed by souza , marzari and vanderbilt @xcite based on the minimization of the quadratic extent of the orbitals .",
    "an alternative , equally promising approach is to use the wannier orbitals of andersen @xcite .",
    "while the former is a `` post - processing '' method , i.e. , the wannier orbitals are constructed after generating the bloch wave functions , the latter may be termed `` pre - processing '' method because the wannier orbitals are constructed before diagonalization of the hamiltonian that yields the band structure @xcite . in this sense , the latter scheme may be more advantageous than the former .",
    "on the other hand , the former is more general because it does not depend on any particular band - structure method .",
    "comparison between the two wannier functions for some selected materials can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "apart from the use of wannier orbitals in constructing lattice models , there are many other applications .",
    "in particular , a close connection with berry s phase @xcite has stimulated intensive works recently @xcite .",
    "related work can be found not only in condensed matter physics but also in chemistry , where the concept of localized molecular orbitals is very useful for understanding chemical bonding as well as for visualization .",
    "the idea of constructing localized molecular orbitals goes back to the early sixties by the maximization of the coulomb energy of the molecular orbitals @xcite or the minimization of the quadratic extent of the molecular orbitals @xcite .",
    "the general problem of transforming a set of bloch states to a set of well localized orbitals is therefore one of important methodological problems in condensed matter physics and chemistry .",
    "another important issue in the downfolding procedure is how to determine effective interaction parameters .",
    "a widely used method is constrained lda ( clda ) @xcite and a recently proposed scheme based on the maximally localized wannier function @xcite may be useful for applications to complicated structures . on the other hand , clda is known to yield unreasonably large values of @xmath1 in some cases ( e.g. late transition metals ) .",
    "this arises from technical difficulty in including part of the self - screening processes between localized electrons leading in some cases to a larger value of _ u _ @xcite .",
    "another method for estimating effective interaction is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "we can find early trials along this line in ref.@xcite .",
    "later on the constrained rpa ( crpa ) scheme was invented @xcite .",
    "the crpa method has several advantages over currently available methods .",
    "it allows for a precise elimination of screening channels , which are to be included in a model hamiltonian , without modifying the one - particle dispersion of the model .",
    "in addition , the effective screened interaction as a function of * r * and * r@xmath2 * can be calculated independent of the basis functions . we will use this method in the present work .",
    "we can also find other proposals in literature such as a hybrid method between clda and crpa @xcite and linear response approach @xcite .",
    "our long - term goal is to construct a first - principles scheme for calculating the electronic structure of correlated materials .",
    "as is well known , the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite in density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite often has difficulties when applied to such systems .",
    "attempts to improve the lda have resulted , among others , in the lda+u @xcite , the lda+dmft ( dynamical mean - field theory @xcite ) @xcite and more recently in the newly developed gw+dmft method @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is shown how the hubbard _ u _ for real materials can be determined self - consistently within the scheme . in these methods",
    "it is crucial to have well localized orbitals representing the hilbert space of the partially filled correlated bands since the screened coulomb interaction _ u _ is usually assumed to be purely on - site .",
    "this is especially the case in the dmft method , where the lattice problem is mapped to an impurity problem @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to demonstrate the usefulness of the wannier orbitals and the feasibility of performing many - body calculations with a unified wannier basis , independent of the starting band structure . to this end",
    "we have calculated the hubbard _ u _ within the crpa scheme using the maximally localized wannier basis and compared the results with independent calculations @xcite in the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) basis @xcite .",
    "the reasonably good agreement between the two sets of results gives us confidence as to the usefulness of the scheme .    as mentioned earlier , it is highly desirable to construct a set of wannier orbitals that minimize the off - site coulomb interaction or equivalently maximizes the on - site _",
    "u_. we follow the method of edmiston and ruedenberg @xcite , which was proposed for molecules , and developed a practical procedure to maximize the _",
    "u _ parameter for periodic crystals through unitary transformation in real space .",
    "application to transition metals shows that the effect of maximization is tiny if we start the optimization from the maximally localized wannier functions .",
    "the wannier function with band index @xmath3 at cell @xmath4 is defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the associated bloch function which can be expanded as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions of a mean - field hamiltonian as @xmath7 in practical implementations , kohn - sham wavefunctions may be used for @xmath8 . in the maximally localized wannier function scheme @xcite ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath9 s are determined such that the quadratic extent of wavefunctions @xmath10 is minimized . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce an energy window and optimize @xmath11 with limiting @xmath12 to the states inside the window .",
    "the parameters for this window ( `` window 1 '' ) are listed in table [ tab : window ] .",
    "the wannier function is more localized as the energy window is larger , since optimization is done in wider hilbert space .",
    "we found , however , that the ( screened ) coulomb interaction is not sensitive to the choice of the energy window unless the window is too wide .",
    ".energy window 1 that limits states to be included in constructing wannier functions , and window 2 to specify localized orbitals @xmath13 for crpa .",
    "the `` 2nd band '' for the window 2 means the second lowest one in the bands with strong 4@xmath14 and 3@xmath15 character .",
    "energies are measured from the fermi level . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is remarkable that for the cases considered in the present work the wannier orbitals constructed by maximizing the on - site _ u _ are almost identical with those of maximally localized wannier orbitals .",
    "since the screened interaction @xmath16 is deep around the wannier center , it is reasonable to expect that the maximally localized wannier orbitals also yield a large value of _ u _ close to the maximum value .",
    "however , the extreme closeness to the maximum value is rather unexpected .",
    "we have also performed the same calculations by maximizing the bare coulomb interaction and found very similar results .",
    "finally we propose a real - space approach of constructing maximally localized wannier orbitals .",

    "it is found that in transition metals the values of the screened coulomb interaction are in reasonable agreement with those from previous calculations based on the lmto - asa .",
    "the somewhat smaller values of the present calculations may be attributed to the more extended nature of the wannier orbitals compared with the more localized truncated partial waves used in taking the matrix elements of the screened interaction in the previous calculations .",
    "unexpectedly we have found that for the cases we have considered the maximally localized wannier functions are remarkably close to the wannier function that maximizes the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "although we have no proof , it is quite likely that this property persists in many other systems .",
    "this makes the maximally localized wannier orbitals a very suitable basis for constructing low - energy model hamiltonians .",
    "we have also proposed a real - space approach for constructing maximally localized wannier orbitals , which may be another practical procedure other than the k - space approach .",
