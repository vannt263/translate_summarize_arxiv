    "bi - directional relay communication has attracted considerable interest recently @xcite@xcite , and various bi - directional relay protocols for wireless systems have been proposed @xcite@xcite . in @xcite",
    "@xcite , the conventional network coding scheme is applied to the bi - directional relay network .",
    "two source nodes transmit to the relay , separately .",
    "the relay decodes the received signals , performs binary network coding , and then broadcasts network coded symbols back to both source nodes .",
    "however , this scheme may cause irreducible error floor due to the detection errors which occur at the relay node .    in @xcite@xcite , an amplify and forward based network coding scheme , referred to as the analog network coding , was proposed . in this scheme ,",
    "both source nodes transmit at the same time so that the relay receives a superimposed signal .",
    "the relay then amplifies the received signal and broadcasts it to both source nodes .",
    "analog network coding is particularly useful in wireless networks as the wireless channel acts as a natural implementation of network coding by summing the wireless signals over the air .",
    "almost all existing works in bi - directional relay communications using analog network coding assume that the sources and the destination have perfect knowledge of channel state information  ( csi ) for all transmission links .",
    "as a result , coherent detection can be readily employed at either sources or relay , or both @xcite@xcite . in some scenarios ,",
    "e.g. the slow fading environment , the csi is likely to be acquired by the use of pilot symbols .",
    "however , when the channel coefficients vary fast , channel estimation may become difficult .",
    "in addition , the channel estimation increases computational complexity in the relay node and reduces the data rate .",
    "moreover , it would be difficult for the destination to acquire the source - to - relay channel perfectly through pilot signal forwarding without noise amplification .",
    "hence , differential modulation without need of any csi would be a practical solution .    in a differential bi - directional relay network ,",
    "each source receives a superposition of differentially encoded signals from the other source , and it has no knowledge of csi of both channels .",
    "all these problems present a great challenge for designing differential modulation schemes in two - way relay channels . in @xcite ,",
    "differential receivers for differential two - way relaying were presented using analog network coding .",
    "these non - coherent schemes were realized by averaging the channel coefficients of the substraction of adjacent received signals .",
    "however , the approaches may result in more than 3 db performance loss compared to the coherent schemes due to instantaneous detection errors .    in this paper , we propose an analog network coding scheme with differential modulation  ( anc - dm ) using amplify - and - forward protocol for bidirectional relay networks so that the csi is not required at both sources and the relay . the performance of the proposed anc - dm scheme is analyzed and a simple asymptotic bit error rate ( ber ) expression is derived .",
    "the analytical results are verified through simulations .",
    "they show that the proposed differential scheme is about 3 db away compared to the coherent detection scheme . to improve the system performance ,",
    "the optimum power allocation between the sources and the relay is determined based on the provided simplified ber .",
    "simulation results show that optimum power allocation yields 1 - 2 db performance improvement over an equal power allocation scheme .",
    "note that unlike @xcite , the destination realizes differential detection by subtracting away its own contribution in the received signals based on the power estimation .",
    "besides , our scheme requires linear complexity , while the detectors in  @xcite are much complex and non - linear which may calculate the modified bessel function of second kind .",
    "note also that the application of differential modulation for the bi - directional relaying in @xcite@xcite with digital network coding is relatively straightforward as the received signals at the relay from the sources can be decoded separately due to the use of orthogonal transmissions . however , for amplify - and - forward relaying @xcite@xcite , the relay receives a superposition of differentially encoded signals from the sources which makes the final detection at the source difficult .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  ii , we describe the proposed differential modulation scheme . theoretical analysis is given in section  iii .",
    "section  iv presents the optimal transmit power allocation between the sources and the relay .",
    "simulation results are provided in section  v. in section  vi , we draw the main conclusions .",

    "we consider a three - node bi - directional relay network consisting of two source nodes , denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and one relay node , denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "all nodes are equipped with one antenna and operate in a half - duplex way so that the complete transmission can be divided into two phases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_bidirectional_relay_dia ] . in the first phase , both source nodes simultaneously send the differentially encoded information to the relay , and",
    "in the second phase , the relay broadcasts the combined signals to both sources .",

    "the signal @xmath13 sent by the source @xmath6 is given by @xmath14 similarly , the signal transmitted by @xmath7 at the time @xmath10 is given by @xmath15      in the bi - directional relayed transmission , the source nodes first broadcast the information to the relay . for simplicity , we assume that the fading coefficients are constant over one frame of length @xmath16 , and change independently from one frame to another . the received signal in the relay at time @xmath10 can be expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the transmit power at @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the rayleigh fading coefficients with zero mean and unit variance between @xmath6 and @xmath8 , and between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , @xmath22 denotes zero mean complex gaussian random variable with two sided power spectral density of @xmath23 per dimension , and we furthermore assume @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 have the same noise variance .    in the second phase ,",
    "the relay @xmath8 amplifies @xmath24 by a factor @xmath25 and then broadcasts its conjugate , denoted by @xmath26 , to both @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the corresponding signal received by @xmath6 at time @xmath10 , denoted by @xmath27 ,",
    "can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 represents the transmit power by the relay , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . note that unlike traditional anc schemes @xcite@xcite , @xmath26 is transmitted from the relay , which obviously yields @xmath34 .",
    "the reason of doing this is to make the receiver easily estimate @xmath35 and then subtract @xmath36 in ( [ eq : y1 ] ) for differential detection .",
    "as the relay has no csi , the normalization factor @xmath25 has to be obtained indirectly .",
    "we may rewrite the received signals in ( [ eq : yr ] ) in a vector format , given by @xmath37 where @xmath38^t$ ] , @xmath39^t$ ] , @xmath40^t$ ] , and @xmath41^t$ ] . to estimate the average receive power ,",
    "we multiply the received signals by its hermitian transpose as @xmath42 by taking the expectation of ( [ eq : betacorr ] ) , @xmath25 can be then approximated at high snr by @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",

    "note that in low snr , @xmath66 could be negative due to the noise effect , and thus we set @xmath67 instead .",
    "the estimation method given in ( [ eq : muf ] ) is evaluated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_bidirectional_relay ] .    by subtracting @xmath36 , ( [ eq : y1d ] ) can be further written as @xmath68 finally , the following linear decoder can be used to recover @xmath49 @xmath69 and @xmath56 can be differentially decoded in a similar way by the source @xmath7 .",
    "note that in comparison to traditional differential modulation @xcite , the extra complexity comes from the @xmath35 estimation in  ( [ eq : muf ] ) , which is linear and only comprises a few number of additions and multiplications .",
    "but the receiver in  @xcite requires complicated computations , such as the zeroth - order modified bessel function of the second kind .    by ignoring the second order term ,",
    "the corresponding snr of the proposed differential detection scheme can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .    alternatively , if coherent detection is used , under the assumption of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath75 available at @xmath6 , after subtracting @xmath76 from @xmath27 in ( [ eq : y1 ] )",
    ", the corresponding snr can be calculated as @xmath77    by comparing ( [ eq : snry1 ] ) and ( [ eq : coherent ] ) , we can easily obtain @xmath78 which clearly indicates that the differential detector in ( [ eq : mldafk ] ) suffers around 3 db performance loss compared to the coherent scheme .",
    "from ( [ eq : nu ] ) , the average power of @xmath79 needs to be calculated .",
    "when @xmath12-psk constellations are applied , the number of symbols produced in the new constellation by @xmath79 is finite .",
    "hence , it is easy to derive the average power of the new constellation sets .",
    "note that the value of @xmath79 can be equal to zero , which may affect the estimation accuracy in ( [ eq : nu ] ) .    in order to overcome this problem , we may properly choose a rotation angle for the symbol modulated in source @xmath7 by @xmath80 , ensuring that @xmath79 in ( [ eq : nu ] ) is nonzero .",
    "for a @xmath12-psk constellation , the effective rotation angle is in the interval @xmath81 $ ] from the symmetry of symbols . for a regular and symmetrical constellation",
    ", the rotation angle may be simply set as @xmath82 .",
    "similar approach may be used to generate the rotation angle for other types of constellations .    here , we give two examples on how to compute the average symbol power :    \\1 .",
    "supposing bpsk constellation @xmath83 is used , we have @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the calculation of average power in the new set is straightforward .",
    "supposing @xmath6 uses the bpsk set @xmath83 , by constellation rotation , @xmath7 can use @xmath85 . and we can get @xmath86 . hence , it is also easy to derive the average power in the new constellation set .",
    "for simplicity , we in this section analyze the ber performance using bpsk for the proposed anc - dm scheme , and we assume @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , and thus , @xmath90 .",
    "( [ eq : snry1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "let @xmath93 , and the ber for bpsk modulation can generally be expressed as @xmath94=\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^\\infty{\\frac{\\exp(-x)f_x(x)}{\\sqrt{x}}\\text{d}x } ,   \\label{eq : aveser}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the gaussian - q function , @xmath96 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath97 .",
    "the right side of the equation can be readily obtained by integration by parts .",
    "the above expression is useful as it allows us to obtain the ber directly in terms of the cdf of @xmath97 .    by using a general result from @xcite , the ber in ( [ eq : aveser ] )",
    "can be approximated in the high snr regime by considering a first order expansion of the cdf of @xmath97 .",
    "specifically , if the first order expansion of the cdf of @xmath97 can be written in the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 represents the average transmit snr . at high snr , the asymptotic ber is given by @xcite @xmath100 the pdf of @xmath97 can be obtained with the help of  @xcite @xmath101u\\left(2(1+\\lambda)x\\right ) ,   \\label{eq : pdfaafk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the zeroth - order and first - order modified bessel functions of the second kind , respectively , and @xmath104 is the unit step function .",
    "note that the exact ber , which is complicated in computation , does not have a closed - form solution .",
    "however , at high snr , when @xmath105 approaches zeros , the @xmath106 function converges to @xmath107 @xcite , and the value of the @xmath108 function is comparatively small , which could be ignored for asymptotic analysis .",
    "hence , @xmath109 in ( [ eq : pdfaafk ] ) can be approximated as @xmath110 for the anc - dm , the cdf of destination snr @xmath111 can be approximated as @xmath112 finally , comparing ( [ eq : cdapprox ] ) with ( [ eq : cdfexpansion ] ) and ( [ eq : aveseraym ] ) , the asymptotic ber of anc - dm at high snr can be approximated as @xmath113",
    "in this section , we discuss how to allocate power to both sources and the relay subject to total transmission power constraint . it can be seen from ( [ eq : uppeprs ] ) that the asymptotic ber of the proposed differential modulation scheme depends non - linearly upon @xmath114 and @xmath30 .",
    "hence , when the total transmit power is fixed , @xmath115 , the power allocation problem over rayleigh channels can be formulated to minimize the asymptotic ber at high snr in  ( [ eq : uppeprs ] ) @xmath116 where we assume @xmath87 and @xmath117 .",
    "the power allocation problem is to find @xmath118 such that the ber in ( [ eq : uppeprs ] ) is minimized subject to the power constraint by solving the following optimization problem @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a positive lagrange multiplier .",
    "the necessary condition for the optimality is found by setting the derivatives of the lagrangian in ( [ eq : flag ] ) with respect to @xmath114 and @xmath30 equal to zero , respectively .",
    "reusing the power constraint , we can calculate at high snr that @xmath121 which indicates the power allocated in the relay should be equal to the total transmit power at both sources in order to compensate the energy used to broadcast combined information in one time slot .",

    "equal transmit power allocation is applied : @xmath126 .",
    "it can be seen that the differential scheme suffers around 3 db performance loss compared to the coherent anc scheme , which has been validated by ( [ eq : cod ] ) .",
    "we also include the genie - aided result by assuming that @xmath35 is perfectly known by the source such that traditional differential decoding can be performed .",
    "it shows from the results that there is almost no performance loss using the estimation method in ( [ eq : muf ] ) which clearly justifies the robustness of the proposed differential decoder .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that , in @xcite , it uses similar genie - aided result as a benchmark as well .",
    "the major difference is that the detectors in @xcite have much inferior performance than the genie - aided result , and it has about 6db performance loss in comparison to the coherent detection scheme .",
    "however , our proposed detection algorithm has comparable performance with the genie - aided result , and only has 3db performance loss than the coherent detection results .",
    "this clearly indicates that our proposed method outperforms the differential detectors in  @xcite .",
    "the main performance loss in @xcite is due to that uncoherent detection approach is employed by statistically averaging off the impact of channel fading coefficients ignoring the instantaneous channel state information .",
