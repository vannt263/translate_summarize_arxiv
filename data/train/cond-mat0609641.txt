    "everybody searches for something : predators look for prey , prey forage , human beings look for better places to work or for lost keys or for partners , spies search for hidden secrets , and knights desperately seek the holy grail , whatever it may be .",
    "the search for a desired target may be long and uncertain ; targets may be sparse , hidden or difficult to detect even when found , or they may have their own life - time and vanish before they are detected .",
    "that is why efficient search strategies appropriate to specific types of situations are highly desirable .",
    "the question of optimal search strategies has motivated a great deal of work within the last years  @xcite .",
    "while earlier work has focused on systematic searches in organized human activities such as rescue operations  @xcite , more recent analyses have been devoted to random strategies  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been realized that in the case of the so - called non - destructive search , when the target reappears after some time at the same location , and when the searcher always remains within the system , lvy flights with randomly reoriented ballistic trajectories provide an optimal search efficiency  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "following the observation of trajectories of foraging animals such as lizards or fish or birds characterized by two distinct types of motion  fast relocation stages non receptive to the target and relatively slow _ reactive _ phases when the target may be detected  @xcite  another type of random search , an intermittent search , has been proposed .",
    "analytical modeling of such random intermittent search strategies has been put forth in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the search of a single target hidden on a one - dimensional regular lattice by a concentration of searchers performing _ intermittent _ random walks . in particular , at each tick of the clock each of the searchers chooses between two possibilities .",
    "one is to jump to a nearest - neighbouring lattice site , and the other is to leave the lattice and fly with a given velocity until it lands back on the lattice at a fixed distance @xmath4 from the departure site .",
    "the term  hidden \" means that the searchers can detect the target only upon landing directly on the target site at the end of a flight , or via a one - step ( nearest - neighbour ) walk onto that site .",
    "intermittency has been invoked in other models ( e.g. , see the models proposed in  @xcite ) and has been observed in a number of ecological and other contexts ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , but all the other features of our model are , to the best of our knowledge , new .",
    "contrary to previous work , which focused on the analysis and optimization of the first passage time to the target from a given location , or on the number of targets encountered  @xcite , here we study the behaviour of a different property , namely , the probability that a single target remains _ undetected _ up to the maximal search time @xmath1 .",
    "we can not , of course , make this random search process certain ; that is , we can not guarantee that the target is found ( or not found ) with unit probability in a finite time , but what we are able to show is that the non - detection probability is a non - monotonic function of the parameter @xmath2 which determines whether a searcher takes a nearest - neighbour step ( probability @xmath2 ) or a long flight [ probability @xmath3 ] , and that it has a sharp minimum at some value of @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , we show that the search efficiency can be dramatically enhanced , by orders of magnitude , by choosing an appropriate value of @xmath2 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we describe our model of intermittent random walks , present definitions , and delineate our main results . in section  [ nondetection ]",
    "we derive a general formula for the non - detection probability .",
    "section  [ intermittent ] is devoted to the analysis of different properties of the intermittent random walk . in section",
    "[ particular ] we focus on a particular exactly solvable case , namely , a lindenberg - shuler intermittent walk with steps of unit length and flights of two lattice spacings .",
    "for this example we discuss the specific features of the optimization procedure .",
    "next , in section  [ optimal ] we consider the general case of intermittent random walks with steps of unit length and flights of fixed length @xmath4 , and define an optimal search strategy .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusions ] we conclude with a brief summary of our results and an outlook of future work .",
    "consider a one - dimensional regular lattice of unit spacing containing @xmath11 sites @xmath12 .",
    "this is the substrate . at one of the lattice sites ,",
    "say at the origin @xmath13 , we hide an immobile target , and only we know that it is there",
    ". then , we randomly place @xmath14 searchers in the lattice under the constraint that none of them is placed at the site with the hidden target , that is , we distribute them randomly over the remaining @xmath15 sites .",
    "the searchers have no knowledge of the location of the target .",
    "next , we let the searchers move according to the following rule ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) : at each tick of the clock , @xmath16 ( @xmath1 is the maximal time the search process may run ) , each searcher selects randomly between two possibilities . with probability @xmath2 , the searcher jumps to one of its nearest neighbouring sites , with equal probabilities to the right or to the left . with probability @xmath17",
    ", the searcher leaves the lattice and flies off - lattice with a given velocity @xmath18 until it lands at a site an fixed integer distance @xmath4 away from the departure site .",
    "the direction of the flight is chosen at random , with equal probabilities to right or left .",
    "the time the searcher spends off - lattice during a flight is @xmath19 , a model parameter that can have integer values @xmath20 .",
    "note that this value defines the velocity @xmath18 .",
    "as stated earlier , the term  hidden \" means that a searcher can not perceive the target when it is off - lattice and may detect it only when it lands on the target site .",
    "the searcher may land there at the end of a flight or by a one - step jump .",
    "once the searcher lands on the target site , one can define an elementary detection probability @xmath21 .",
    "the target may immediately be recognized when first encountered by a searcher ( @xmath22 , perfect detection ) , or detection may take place with a given probability @xmath23 . in the latter case ,",
    "when any of the searchers arrives at the site occupied by the target , there is always a possibility that the target remains undetected ( imperfect detection ) .",
    "here we focus on the perfect detection case",
    ". some aspects of the search kinetics in the imperfect detection case for the one - dimensional system will be discussed briefly in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "an extension of the model to @xmath24-dimensional spaces and some other subtle questions not pursued here will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "our first goal is to determine the probability @xmath5 that the target remains undetected up to time @xmath1 , the maximal time the search process is allowed to run , which merely depends on our patience or on experimental constraints .",
    "we show in the next section that in the perfect detection limit the probability @xmath5 that no searcher has reached the target up to time @xmath1 obeys the standard formula ( see , e.g.  @xcite for more details ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the expected value of the _ number of distinct sites _ visited on the substrate by any searcher in an @xmath1-step walk ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "_ this is a crucial equation _",
    ", since we will arrive at results for @xmath5 via calculations of @xmath26 .    we will calculate @xmath26 explicitly for the intermittent random walk and determine its asymptotic behaviour analytically in the large-@xmath1 limit . using these results",
    ", we set out to show that there always exists a value @xmath27 , @xmath28 , which maximizes the expected number of distinct substrate sites visited by an intermittent random walk up to time @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , it minimizes the probability @xmath5 in equation  ( [ survival ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate that by choosing this optimal value of @xmath2 the non - detection probability @xmath5 in equation  ( [ survival ] ) can be made orders of magnitude smaller than those of the  pure \" cases @xmath29 ( nearest - neighbor steps only ) or @xmath30 ( flights only ) , for which asymptotically @xmath31.\\ ] ] and @xmath32,\\ ] ] the result  ( [ clas2 ] ) is well - known and reflects the fact that a random walk in low dimensional systems ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) compactly explores the space ; that is , @xmath26 grows _ sublinearly _ with time @xmath1 , and each site ever visited by such a walk is most probably visited many times .",
    "hence , searching a target in a low dimensional system with the help of a standard random walk is not very efficient , since the walker wastes a lot of time revisiting sites that do not contain the target .",
    "the result  ( [ clas2 ] ) is the same with the replacement @xmath35 ( i.e. , it is the same as that of a nearest neighbor random walk for a shorter time ) .",
    "this further decreases the probability of detection because it does not explore the local regions at all before making a jump to a site that has probably been visited many times before .",
    "it is thus not an efficient search strategy either .",
    "we find that although the sublinear growth of @xmath26 is unavoidable in any one dimensional random walk , and , even more specifically , the asymptotic dependence @xmath36 , for fixed @xmath4 it is possible to optimize the search strategy via an intermittent walk with a particular choice of @xmath2 that depends on the length of the walk ( calculated explicitly later ) .",
    "we obtain the asymptotic result @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is an increasing function of the flight distance @xmath4 .",
    "note that the leading term in the exponent contains a pre - factor @xmath39 , @xmath40 , which can make it considerably larger than the corresponding terms in equations  ( [ clas1 ] ) and ( [ clas2 ] ) and thus may result in a substantial increase of the detection probability .",
    "in this section we define the probability @xmath5 that the target is not detected up to time @xmath1 , and express it using well - known properties of random motion that have been extensively discussed in the literature ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , we begin by introducing the notation @xmath41 to denote the random process that describes a searcher s trajectory , and @xmath42 to denote the probability that @xmath41 , which is initially at site @xmath43 , is at site @xmath12 at time @xmath44 .",
    "we find it useful to present the derivation because , contrary to most studies , we are interested in defining the number of distinct sites visited by @xmath41 only on the substrate , which is a subset of all available space . indeed",
    ", most existing work concerns random walks that never leave the lattice so that the equality @xmath45 holds at all times . in our case",
    "this probability is not conserved , @xmath46 , since the searchers spend some portion of their time off - lattice .",
    "we present this analysis in the most general case , assuming only that @xmath41 is a homogeneous process .",
    "suppose there are altogether @xmath14 searchers labeled @xmath47 , and let @xmath48 denote a given @xmath44-step trajectory of the @xmath49-th searcher .",
    "then , in the perfect detection case the indicator function @xmath50 of the event that the target has not been detected up to time @xmath1 for ( arbitrary ) given trajectories of all @xmath14 searchers can be written as @xmath51 , \\;\\;\\ ;",

    "we are clear on the particular strategy that we wish to optimize , namely , the probability that the target will be detected by at least one of the searchers by time @xmath1 .",
    "it is unlikely that either @xmath133 or @xmath130 provide this optimization .",
    "indeed , we find below that the optimal detection strategy is achieved with an @xmath1-dependent value of @xmath2 that also depends on the jump velocity .",
    "we now return to the calculation at the end of section  [ intermittent ] to find the generating function of the expected value of the number of distinct sites visited by an individual searcher . with the substitution of equation  ( [ imp2 ] ) into equation  ( [ imp ] ) , this generating function is given by @xmath134 we thus turn to the analysis of @xmath85 .",

    "the actual contribution of the second term to @xmath26 turns out to be negligible , since it contributes in equation  ( [ aa ] ) only to order @xmath187 , but we need the existence of this term to obtain the correct asymptotic result .    in this particular case of a search for an immobile hidden target by an intermittent random walk with nearest - neighbour and next - nearest - neighbour steps the best strategy can be summarized as follows . if we are ready to wait a sufficiently long time @xmath1 but want to be sure that at that moment of time we will attain the lowest possible non - detection probability @xmath5 , we choose @xmath188 .",
    "note also that this strategy is quite efficient considering that nearest - neighbour and next - nearest - neighbour steps are not very different from one other .",
    "the enhancement of the expected number of distinct sites visited through this strategy is a factor of @xmath189 .",
    "this effect is exponentiated in the non - detection probability , so that it is dramatically apparent in figure  [ fig2](b ) .",
    "the analysis presented in the previous section for a particular case can be generalized to arbitrary values of @xmath4 and @xmath89 by following essentially the same reasoning .",
    "the algebraic derivations that lead to the results are longer and more tedious , but the results are similar in form to those obtained previously .",
    "the outcome , as we shall see , is that the detection probability enhancement can be made much greater than that obtained under the restrictions that @xmath158 and @xmath127 or @xmath181 .",
    "in fact , it can be improved by orders of magnitude .    as before , to calculate the generating function for the distinct number of sites",
    "visited we need to determine the generating function for the probability of being at the origin .",
    "the integral in equation  ( [ n ] ) can no longer be done in closed form for arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath89 , but it is possible to carry out an expansion in powers of @xmath167 and retain the terms necessary for the computation of @xmath26 . as before , the cases @xmath170 and @xmath171 need to be treated separately because the latter is still a special case . for @xmath171",
    "the expansion is fairly straightforward and leads to @xmath190 the calculation is more elaborate for @xmath170 .",
    "it is essential to retain not only the leading divergent contribution in @xmath167 as @xmath191 , but also the contribution independent of @xmath167 .",
    "this is because ultimately once again we need the contributions of @xmath192 as well as @xmath193 to @xmath26 to arrive at the correct optimization .",
    "we find @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath196 and @xmath197 are the values of the functions @xmath198 and @xmath199 of equation  ( [ tauxi ] ) at @xmath200 .",
    "substitution into equation  ( [ sites3 ] ) leads to @xmath201 which implies that at @xmath202 the leading asymptotic behavior of the expected number of distinct sites visited by an intermittent random walk is @xmath203 finally , the integral @xmath204 is not available in closed form , but its important contribution to the problem can be estimated . for sufficiently large @xmath1",
    "it is small everywhere except for the neighbourhood of @xmath169 . to extract the leading contribution for small @xmath2 we change the variable of integration in equation  ( [ int ] ) from @xmath205 to the auxilliary variable @xmath206 , in terms",
    "of which @xmath207 the singularity at the lower limit of integration @xmath208 is integrable for any value of @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the integrand vanishes sufficiently fast to insure that it is integrable as @xmath209 .",
    "hence , we may set @xmath210 everywhere in the integrand and we can extend the upper integration limit to infinity .",
    "this provides the leading small-@xmath2 contribution , @xmath211    the subsequent reasoning now proceeds exactly as in the previous section .",
    "we wish to determine the value of @xmath2 that maximizes @xmath26 .",
    "again , we expect that this @xmath2 is small but strictly positive , so we focus on the result  ( [ m ] ) . maximizing @xmath26 with respect to @xmath2",
    "we find that @xmath212 the resulting asymptotic form for the distinct number of sites visited finally is @xmath213 where @xmath214 this is the generalization of equation  ( [ ls ] ) .",
    "it is valid when @xmath215 , that is , when @xmath216 , which insures that the first term in @xmath217 is dominant .",
    "note that the leading contribution to @xmath26 is again the outcome of setting @xmath169 in the first term of  ( [ m ] ) .",
    "the second term ultimately does not contribute to leading order in @xmath1 , but , to stress once again , we were required the use the @xmath179 result  ( [ m ] ) because @xmath6 is positive definite .",
    "in figure  [ fig3](a ) we plot our analytic result  ( [ m ] ) using the estimate  ( [ int2 ] ) ( lines ) as well as the results of monte carlo simulations ( symbols ) as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the results are shown for @xmath218 and various values of @xmath1 and @xmath89 , and the agreement is again excellent .",
    "the larger symbols in the figure denote the positions of the maxima , which are well captured by our analytical curves .",
    "figure  [ fig3](b ) shows the inverse of the associated non - detection probability for various values of @xmath1 .",
    "( a)(b )    the essential result of this section is the very large enhancement of the target detection probability that is possible by the appropriate @xmath1-dependent choice of the intermittency parameter compared to the outcome for the  pure \" random walks with @xmath30 or @xmath9 . the leading term in equation  ( [ tr ] )",
    "contains the factor @xmath219 which may be large and may therefore lead to a substantial decrease in the probability that the target has not been detected up to time @xmath1 .",
    "for example , for @xmath220 , @xmath127 , and @xmath221 , with a density of searchers as low as @xmath222 ( cf . figure  [ fig3](b ) ) , the non - detection probability for the  pure \" cases is @xmath223 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we choose , with @xmath224 , the probability that the target has not been yet detected up to this time is @xmath225 , i.e. , three orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "note finally that in one dimension for fixed @xmath4 the optimal search strategy involves a progressively smaller fraction of nearest neighbour steps as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "we have studied the search kinetics of a single target hidden on a one - dimensional regular lattice by a concentration of  searchers \" performing _ intermittent _ random walks ; that is , at each tick of the clock , each searcher has a choice of stepping on a nearest neighbour with probability @xmath2 , or flying off - lattice in either direction with velocity @xmath18 over a distance @xmath4 with probability @xmath3 .",
    "we have determined the probability @xmath5 that the target remains _ undetected _ up to the maximal search time @xmath1 , have established that @xmath5 is a non - monotonic function of @xmath2 , and that in fact it has a sharp minimum at an @xmath1-dependent value of @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , we have shown that the search efficiency can be dramatically enhanced , by orders of magnitude , by choosing @xmath2 appropriately .",
    "we close this paper with some observations and problems for future research .",
    "if we are at liberty to choose @xmath4 , we may increase the number of distinct sites visited within a given time interval @xmath1 by picking an @xmath1-dependent value of @xmath4 , cf .",
    "equation  ( [ tr ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , equation  ( [ tr ] ) is a parabolic function of @xmath4 , which implies that there should be an optimal @xmath4 for any fixed @xmath1 . to wit , making @xmath4 too large for fixed @xmath1 would be counter - productive since the searchers would spend most of their time flying off - lattice . on the other hand",
    ", a value of @xmath4 that is too small would detain the searchers in already well - explored regions and delay the exploration of new ones .",
    "this issue requires a more subtle analysis and a more intricate optimization procedure , to be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our model can be straightforwardly extended to higher dimensions . in two dimensions",
    "there is also a value of @xmath2 that maximizes @xmath26 and that depends on the maximal search time @xmath1 , as seen in the numerical results shown in figure  [ fig4 ] . in three dimensions and higher",
    ", we expect an @xmath1-independent value of @xmath2 to maximize @xmath26 .",
    "the results in this paper were obtained for the case of perfect detection ( @xmath226 ) , that is , once a searcher lands at the site occupied by the target it detects it with certainty .",
    "it is easy to show that in the general case when detection of the target upon encouter is less than certain ( @xmath227 ) , the probability that the target remains undetected up to time @xmath1 is @xmath228 where @xmath229 is determined via its generating function , @xmath230 } \\sum_s p(s|0;z).\\ ] ] in low dimensional systems , i.e. , in one and two dimensions , @xmath85 diverges as @xmath231 , and consequently , in the limit @xmath178 , @xmath229 converges to @xmath26 so that the leading large-@xmath1 behavior will be independent of @xmath21 provided that @xmath232 . in three and higher dimensions",
    "the leading behavior will depend on @xmath21 .",
    "an interesting extension of our model may be a situation in which the target itself moves randomly .",
    "it is known , however , that if this motion is diffusive ( or sub - diffusive ) in low dimensions , the long - time asymptotic form of the probability @xmath5 is exactly the same as when the target is immobile ( see  @xcite and also  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , in low dimensions in the large-@xmath1 limit , the search for a diffusive ( or sub - diffusive ) target by searchers performing intermittent random walks will proceed in exactly the same way as determined in this paper for the case of an immobile target .",
    "finally , we remark that a sensible extension of this model would be to introduce the possibility of jumping , with a given velocity over arbitrary distances @xmath233 , with probability @xmath234",
    ". a robust approach would be to search for the distribution @xmath234 that minimizes the non - detection probability @xmath5 .",
