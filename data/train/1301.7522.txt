    "the geometry and dynamics of the solar corona are determined by the evolving magnetic field at the sun s surface ( photosphere ) .",
    "thus , magnetic fields are believed to play a dominant role for active phenomena carried out in the solar corona . in order to study solar eruptive phenomena",
    ", we have to understand how magnetic energy is stored in the pre - eruptive corona .",
    "hence , the three dimensional ( 3d ) structure of magnetic fields and electric currents in the pre - eruptive corona and the amount of free energy stored in the field have to determined @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , reliable magnetic field measurements are still restricted to the level of the photosphere , where the inverse zeeman effect in fraunhofer lines is observable .",
    "even if the measurement of magnetic fields in the solar corona has considerably improved in recent decades @xcite , further developments are needed before accurate data are routinely available .    as an alternative to measurements in the solar atmosphere , magnetic field extrapolation",
    "have been implemented to calculate the field from the measured photospheric field using assumptions that the fields are force - free . in this model assumption ,",
    "the corona magnetic forces are dominant that all non - magnetic forces like plasma pressure gradient and gravity can be neglected in the lowest order @xcite .",
    "this implies that , if there are currents , they must be aligned with the magnetic field . to describe the equilibrium structure of the static coronal magnetic field ,",
    "the force - free assumption is appropriate : @xmath0 @xmath1 subject to the boundary condition @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the magnetic field and @xmath4 is measured vector field on the photosphere .",
    "equation  ( [ one ] ) states that the currents are co - aligned with magnetic fields , where @xmath5 is the torsion function that represents the proportionality between the electric current density and the magnetic field .",
    "equation  ( [ two ] ) describes the absence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "parameter @xmath5 of equation  ( [ one ] ) can be a function of position , but the combination of equation  ( [ one ] ) and equation  ( [ two ] ) ( @xmath6 ) requires that @xmath5 be constant along a given field line .",
    "@xmath7 yields the current - free potential field",
    ". if @xmath5 is constant everywhere in the volume under consideration , the field is called linear force - free field ( lfff ) , otherwise it is nonlinear force - free field ( nlfff ) @xcite .",
    "potential and linear force - free fields can be used as a first step to model the general structure of magnetic fields in the solar corona , the use of nonlinear force free fields is essential to understand eruptive phenomena .",
    "practically there are both observational and theoretical reasons which suggest that the pre - eruptive magnetic fields are non - linear force - free fields . for details of those models we direct the readers to @xcite .",
    "most of the nlfff modeling codes are implemented in the cartesian geometry .",
    "therefore those codes are not well suited for larger domains , since the spherical nature of the solar surface can not be neglected when the field of view is large .",
    "@xcite has studied that different nlfff models have different field line configurations in the coronal volume with widely varying estimates of the magnetic free energy .",
    "the study suggested that the main reasons for that problem are ( 1 ) non - force free nature of the field within the photosphere , ( 2 ) the uncertainties on vector - field measurements , particularly on the transverse component , and ( 3 ) the needs of large domain that can capture the connections of an active region to its surroundings to accommodate more electric currents associated with the full active regions of interest .",
    "solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) mission has made repeated observations of large , almost global scale events in which large scale connection between active regions may play fundamental role .",
    "therefore , this needs motivate us to implement a nlfff procedure in spherical geometry to large scale boundary data from the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) on board sdo and synoptic optical long - term investigations of the sun survey ( solis)/ vector spectromagnetograph ( vsm ) @xcite    coronal magnetic fields manifest themselves in x - rays and euv images in the shapes of coronal loops .",
    "those loops provide an additional constraint which is not currently being used due to the mathematical complications of incorporating such input into numerical models @xcite .",
    "the 3d structure of magnetic loops from nlfff models help us for modeling of plasma loops , and understanding coronal heating and plasma flows along the loops .",
    "in this work , we apply our spherical nlfff procedure to a group of active regions observed on october 11 , 2011 and november 13 , 2012 using solis / vsm data . during the former observation ,",
    "there were six active regions ( ars 11610 , 11611 , 11612 , 11613 , 11614 and 11615 ) and there were three vertically aligned active regions in later one . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the connectivity between three neighboring active regions which were horizontally aligned . here ,",
    "we compare the extrapolated magnetic loops with their respective extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) observations by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on board sdo .",
    "this study requires extrapolating the three - dimensional nlfff coronal fields from the photospheric boundary data .",
    "the photospheric vector magnetograms , obtained by the synoptic optical long - term investigations of the sun survey ( solis)/ vector spectromagnetograph ( vsm ) are used as the boundary conditions . meanwhile , those measured data are inconsistent with the above force - free assumption .",
    "therefore , one has to apply some transformations to these data before nonlinear force - free extrapolation codes can be applied .",
    "this procedure is known as preprocessing .",
    "this preprocessing scheme removes forces and torques from the boundary and approximates the photospheric magnetic field to the low plasma-@xmath8 force - free chromosphere . for detailed descriptions of the method we direct the readers to @xcite for cartesian geometry and @xcite for spherical one .",
    "we solve the force - free equations ( [ one])(with the form @xmath9 ) and ( [ two ] ) using optimization principle @xcite in spherical geometry @xcite .",
    "the method minimizes a joint measure ( @xmath10 ) of the normalized lorentz forces and the divergence of the field throughout the volume of interest , @xmath11 .",
    "optimization procedure is spherical geometry is given by : @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 measure how well the force - free eqs .",
    "( [ one ] ) and divergence - free ( [ two ] ) conditions are fulfilled , respectively , and both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are weighting functions . for detailed description of the use of weighting functions , we direct the readers to @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath21 is surface integral over the photosphere which allows us to relax the field on the photosphere towards force - free solution without to much deviation from the original surface field data , @xmath22 . in this integral , @xmath23 is a space - dependent diagonal matrix which gives different weights for observed surface field components depending on its relative accuracy in measurement .    the full inversion of solis data is performed in the framework of milne - eddington model ( me)@xcite . the inversion is made only for pixels whose polarization signal is above a selected threshold .",
    "pixels with polarization below threshold are left undetermined .",
    "these data gaps represent a major difficulty for existing magnetic field extrapolation schemes . therefore , those missing data is considered most inaccurate and are taken account of by setting @xmath23 to zero in all elements of the matrix . for the detailed description of the method we direct the readers to @xcite and @xcite for cartesian and spherical geometry , respectively",
    "in this study , we have used our spherical nlfff optimization procedure to a group of active regions observed by solis on october 11 , 2011 and november 13 , 2012 . during the former observation ,",
    "there were six active regions ( ars 11610 , 11611 , 11612 , 11613 , 11614 and 11615 ) and there were three vertically aligned active regions(ars 11314 , 11316 , and 11319 ) in later one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a and b ) . in order to accommodate the connectivity between those ars and their surroundings , we adopt a non uniform spherical grid @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 in the direction of radius , latitude , and longitude , respectively . before applying our spherical nlfff , we preprocessed the two photospheric vector field data sets using our spherical preprocessing routine .",
    "there are no vector magnetic field measurements for the side and top boundaries of a localized domain .",
    "therefore , we have to make assumptions about these fields before performing a nlfff extrapolation .",
    "we assumed the lateral and upper boundaries of the computational domain as current - free . in order to initialize our nlfff code",
    ", we calculated potential field from those data sets using their respective preprocessed radial field components ( @xmath27 ) using spherical harmonic expansion . the computational box is a wedge - shaped volume @xmath11 with six boundary surfaces ( four lateral side boundaries , top and photospheric boundaries ) .",
    "this box enables us to study the connectivities between active regions and their surroundings for the large field - of - views .            for computing the nlfff field solutions for the two data sets , we use the preprocessed surface vector boundary fields with radial , longitudinal , and latitudinal components .",
    "we minimize the functional @xmath28 of eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we implement the new term @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) to treat those data gaps in solis @xcite . for those pixels ,",
    "for which @xmath22 was successfully inverted , we allow deviations between the model field @xmath3 and the input fields observed @xmath22 surface field using eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , so that the model field can be iterated closer to a force - free solution even if the observations are inconsistent .",
    "we have used langrangian multiplier of @xmath29 to control the speed with which the lower boundary is injected during the nlfff extrapolation .    in order to compare our reconstructions with observation , we plot the selected field lines of the nlfff solutions for the two data sets and we overlay the field lines with corresponding aia 193  image ( see figure  [ fig2]c and d ) . from figure  [ fig2]c and d , one can see that the field lines of nlfff model solutions are reconstructed in such away that they fit with the observation .",
    "there are spatial correspondence between the overall shape of the nlfff field lines and the euv loops for both observational dates .",
    "those qualitative comparisons between nlfff model magnetic field lines and the observed euv loops of aia images indicate that the nlfff model provides a more consistent field for large field - of - views .",
    "even if the qualitative nature is not ideal , it remains the best option in the absence of a more reliable quantitative comparison .",
    ".the magnetic energy associated with extrapolated 3d nlfff field configurations from solis data sets of the two dates . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     once we have determined the 3d structure of the coronal magnetic field using the sophisticated numerical modeling , we can use those field solutions to calculate different quantities in the solar corona .",
    "we estimate the free magnetic energy to be the difference between the extrapolated nlfff and the potential field with the same normal boundary conditions in the photosphere@xcite .",
    "we therefore estimate the upper limit to the free magnetic energy associated with coronal currents of the form @xmath30 our result for the estimation of free - magnetic energy in table  [ table3 ] shows that the nlfff solutions have @xmath31 and @xmath32 more energy than the corresponding potential field solutions obtained from data observed on october 11 , 2011 and november 13 , 2012 , respectively .    in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the connectivity between two active regions one in the northern hemisphere and the other in the south . in this study",
    "we have used the same method to calculate the percentage of the total electric current shared between the ar 11319 in the northern hemisphere and ar 11316 in the southern hemisphere observed on october 11 , 2011 at 18:45ut ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . in order to quantify the percentage share in the electric current , we first identified those field lines carrying electric currents and emanating from ar 11319 and ending into ar 11316 .",
    "the ratio of total electric current density flux due to those electric current carrying field lines connecting the two ars to the total electric current density flux due to all field lines with current emanating from ar 11319 gives us the percentage share in the electric current between the two active regions .",
    "for this case study , we found that @xmath33 of positive / negative polarity of ar 11319 in the northern hemisphere is connected to positive / negative polarity of ar 11316 in southern hemisphere .",
    "there are more electric current connectivity between these ars as they are closer to each other even if they are located in different hemispheres .",
    "therefore , during this particular observation , there are substantial number of trans - equatorial loops carrying electric current .",
    "coronal magnetic field modeling codes in cartesian geometry are not well suited for larger domains , since the spherical nature of the solar surface can not be neglected when the field of view is large . in this study , we have investigated the 3d coronal magnetic field associated with two data sets observed on october 11 , 2011 and november 13 , 2012 by analyzing solis / vsm data using nlfff model . during the former observation ,",
    "there were six active regions ( ars 11610 , 11611 , 11612 , 11613 , 11614 and 11615 ) and there were three vertically aligned active regions in later one .",
    "we have used our spherical nlfff codes to compute the magnetic field solutions for large field of views with six active regions and three vertically aligned ones for the first time .    for the comparison with observations , we overlayed the nlfff model field solutions for the two data sets with their respective euv loops from aia .",
    "the study indicates that there are significant agreements between euv loops and nlfff model solutions .",
