    "long - lived @xmath13 states are especially well suited for testing qcd via lattice calculations @xcite and effective theories of strong interactions , like potential models @xcite .    in this paper we analyze events with two photons and two leptons ( two electrons or two muons ) .",
    "the events are constrained to be consistent with the @xmath14 or @xmath15 transitions , with the @xmath16 or @xmath17 decaying to a lepton pair .",
    "the analysis of similar events containing four photons and two leptons is the subject of a separate paper submitted to this conference @xcite .",
    "the various photon transitions that contribute to our data are outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] .",
    "the two - photon sample is dominated by photon transitions from the @xmath0 to one of the triplet @xmath18 states , followed by a subsequent photon transition to the @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the product branching ratios for these decays can be unfolded using the known measurements for @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "the ratios of these branching fractions for the same @xmath21 and different final state @xmath22 test theoretical predictions for the ratio of the corresponding e1 matrix elements , @xmath23",
    ". ratios of these branching fractions for different @xmath21 and the same final state @xmath22 give us insight into the ratios of the hadronic widths of the various @xmath18 states .",
    "measurement of the photon energies in the first transition allows a mass determination of the @xmath24 states .",
    "we also observe the rare photon cascade @xmath25 , @xmath26 . from the measured product branching ratio",
    ", we derive the @xmath6 e1 matrix element , which is of particular interest since different theoretical estimates of its value disagree .",
    "we also use our sample to search for @xmath27 and @xmath28 transitions between the @xmath0 and either the @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath27 transitions are isospin violating decays .",
    "analogous transitions were previously observed in the @xmath29 system between the @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the two - photon cascade transitions via the @xmath32 states were previously observed by the cusb @xcite and cleo - ii @xcite experiments .",
    "here , we present the results based on 1.1 fb@xmath33 of integrated luminosity accumulated at the @xmath0 resonance , corresponding to @xmath34 @xmath0 decays .",
    "this is roughly a ten - fold increase in statistics compared to the cleo - ii data set , and roughly a four - fold increase compared to the integrated cusb data set .",
    "thanks to the good granularity and large solid angle of the cleo csi(tl ) calorimeter , the cleo - iii detection efficiency for these final states is a factor of 2 - 3 larger than in the cusb detector .",
    "even though the cleo - iii calorimeter is essentially the same as in the cleo - ii detector @xcite , the photon selection efficiency and detector resolution were improved in the endcaps and in part of the barrel calorimeter thanks to a new , lower - mass , tracking system @xcite built for cleo - iii .",
    "another change was the replacement of the time - of - flight system by a rich detector in the barrel part .",
    "finally , the calorimeter endcaps were restacked and moved farther away from the interaction point to accommodate a new , higher luminosity , interaction point optics .",
    "we select events with exactly two photons and two oppositely charged leptons .",
    "the leptons must have momenta of at least 3.75 gev .",
    "we distinguish between electrons and muons by their energy deposition in the calorimeter .",
    "electrons must have a high ratio of energy observed in the calorimeter to the momentum measured in the tracking system ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "muons are identified as minimum ionizing particles , and are required to leave @xmath36 mev of energy in the calorimeter .",
    "stricter muon identification does not reduce the background in the final sample , since all significant background sources contain muons .",
    "each photon must have at least 60 mev of energy .",
    "we also ignore all photons below 180 mev in the calorimeter region closest to the beam , because of the spurious photons generated by beam - related backgrounds .",
    "the total momentum of all photons and leptons in each event must be balanced to within 300 mev .",
    "the invariant mass of the two leptons must be consistent with either the @xmath17 or @xmath16 mass within @xmath37 mev .",
    "much better identification of the @xmath17 or @xmath16 resonance is obtained by measuring the mass of the system recoiling against the two photons .",
    "the average resolution of the recoil mass is 15 mev ( 9 mev ) for the @xmath17 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the resolution of the different states in the @xmath24 triplet relies on the energy measurement of the lower energy photon in the event .",
    "this photon must be detected in the barrel part of the calorimeter , where the energy resolution is best .",
    "the higher energy photon is allowed to be detected in the endcap part for the @xmath38 events .",
    "the final discrimination against the backgrounds is performed by using the energy of the lower energy photon and the mass of the system recoiling against the photons .",
    "the energy of the less energetic photon , @xmath39 , must peak for the signal events at one of the values corresponding to @xmath40 for various @xmath21 .",
    "the recoil mass , @xmath41 , calculated using the photon four - vectors and the beam energy , must peak at the @xmath16 or @xmath17 mass .",
    "we actually use the difference between the center - of - mass energy and the mass of the system recoiling against the photons , @xmath42 , which peaks at @xmath43 for the signal events .",
    "scatter plots of @xmath44 versus @xmath39 are shown for @xmath45 and @xmath46 events separately in figs .",
    "[ fig : mdrvseglowmm]-[fig : mdrvseglowee ] . clusters of events for @xmath47 followed by a radiative decay to the @xmath16 or @xmath17 are clearly visible .",
    "a less intense cluster of events , corresponding to @xmath48 , @xmath49 , is also visible .",
    "the backgrounds vary smoothly over these two variables and come predominantly from radiative bhabhas and @xmath50pair events .",
    "the @xmath46 channel clearly has much higher background due to the higher bhabha cross - section .",
    "to determine the masses of the @xmath24 states , we combine the data for the two - photon cascades to the @xmath52 and the @xmath53 .",
    "the recoil mass difference @xmath44 must be within @xmath54 of the expected value .",
    "the energy spectrum of the lower energy photon is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : egammalow ] .    from the three photon lines expected from @xmath55 transitions ,",
    "only the @xmath2 and @xmath3 lines are clearly visible .",
    "the third @xmath56 line is suppressed by the larger hadronic width of this state , which makes its radiative branching ratios small . in the fit to the data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : egammalow ] ) , we parameterize each line by a gaussian with an asymmetric low - energy tail",
    ". the number of events and the peak energy for each line are free parameters in the fit , except for the position of the @xmath56 line , which was fixed to the value obtained from the fit to the inclusive photon spectrum in multi - hadronic events",
    ". the ratios of the widths of the three peaks were fixed to the monte carlo determined dependence of the energy resolution on the photon energy .",
    "the overall energy resolution scale factor was left free in the fit .",
    "we also fixed the energy dependence of the turn - over point from the gaussian to the power - law tail from the monte carlo simulations .",
    "again , an overall scaling factor for the turn - over point was adjusted to the data by the fit .",
    "the backgrounds were assumed to be linear in energy , as suggested by the @xmath44 sidebands , the off - resonance data ( 0.13 fb@xmath33 collected below the @xmath0 resonance ) and other data taken at the @xmath57 .",
    "the fit yields @xmath58 events for the @xmath2 line positioned at @xmath59 mev , @xmath60 events for the @xmath3 line positioned at @xmath61 mev and @xmath62 events for the @xmath56 line .",
    "the fitted energy resolution scale factor is @xmath63 , thus the data are consistent with the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the fitted energy resolution corresponds to @xmath64 mev for @xmath65 mev .    splitting the data into di - electron and di - muon subsamples , as well as @xmath16 and @xmath17 subsamples ,",
    "gives consistent results within the statistical errors .",
    "varying the order of the background polynomial and the fit range results in very small changes to the fitted photon energies .",
    "the dominant systematic error is due to the uncertainties in fixing the absolute photon energy scale at various photon energies .",
    "we used @xmath66 decays and the known @xmath27 mass to correct for small non - linearities in the shower energy determination .",
    "then , we used the recoil mass distributions in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 data presented here , as well as the @xmath67 and @xmath68 transitions , together with the well known @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath0 masses @xcite , to check the @xmath27 calibration . from this study",
    "we have determined our systematic uncertainty in the photon energies relevant for the @xmath69 lines to be @xmath70 .    including the systematic error ( strongly correlated between the two lines ) , the photon energies are : @xmath71 these results are consistent with , but more precise than , previous determinations @xcite .    using the @xmath0 mass @xcite",
    ", we can turn these photon - line energies into @xmath72 masses : @xmath73",
    "we can determine the product branching ratios for the cascade sequence from the photon - line amplitudes fitted separately to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 subsamples .",
    "the efficiency for each photon line was determined from monte carlo simulations that included the full angular correlations between the photons and leptons @xcite .",
    "we also simulated final state radiation in the annihilation to lepton pairs @xcite .",
    "in addition to one - dimensional fits to the @xmath39 distributions , we also performed two - dimensional fits to @xmath44 vs.  @xmath39 which improved the statistical errors .",
    "the systematic errors were determined from variations of the cuts , and the fit procedure and from the uncertainty in the number of @xmath0 decays in our sample . after we determine the product branching ratios for @xmath74 , we also unfold them for @xmath75 using the world average values for @xmath76 @xcite , and finally , for @xmath77 using the world average values for @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "all the results are summarized in table  [ tab : rates ] , which also contains a comparison with previous measurements .",
    "the statistical significance of the @xmath56 signal for the @xmath14 transitions is three standard deviations ( see table  [ tab : rates ] ) . since the @xmath56 amplitude for the @xmath15 transition is less significant ( @xmath79 ) , we do not claim observation of this transition and set an upper limit on its rate at the 90%  confidence level .",
    "our results are generally in agreement with previous measurements , except for the cascade rates via the @xmath80 state , for which we ( and the previous cleo - ii analysis ) measure a substantially higher rate than obtained by cusb . in all cases ,",
    "our measurements have better precision than the previous determinations .",

    "predictions for the ratio @xmath106 are not as model dependent , but somewhat higher than our experimental value .      assuming spin independence of the matrix elements , the ratios of hadronic widths ( @xmath107 ) of the @xmath1 states can be derived from : @xmath108    taking @xmath109 from table  [ tab : rates ] and applying this formula to @xmath110 and @xmath111 , we obtain : @xmath112 to leading order in perturbative qcd , both states annihilate to two hard gluons and the ratio is expected to be simply the ratio of spin counting factors : 15/4=3.75 @xcite . however , qcd correction are known to be large .",
