    "<S> phase - coherent transport in mesoscopic superconductor / normal metal ( @xmath5 ) systems has been an active area of research during the last decade @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interest in the theoretical investigations was stimulated by impressive technological advances and by experimental activity in studying various properties of small mesoscopic structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interesting phenomena in mesoscopic systems are due to the importance of both the phase coherence established in the @xmath3 constriction by the proximity effect and significant departure of quasiparticles from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this is completely true for two - barrier structures @xmath6 with barriers at the interfaces between the @xmath2  and @xmath7 electrodes connected by a superconducting constriction @xmath8of length @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensions of the constriction transverse to the current direction are assumed to be small in comparison with the london penetration depth in the @xmath7electrode . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the system with diffusive transport , i.e. we suppose that the mean free path @xmath10 in the @xmath11 region is small with respect to the constriction length @xmath12 because of non - conservation of the momentum , the interference of normal electron wave functions related to reflections from the barriers is not essential . nevertheless the coherence of different ( ordinary and andreev ) reflection processes related to the condensate wave function and nonzero order parameter @xmath13 in the superconductor @xmath11is very important because the inter - barrier distance  @xmath14is supposed to be small in comparison with@xmath15 ,  where @xmath16is the diffusion coefficient . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we assume that transparencies of both barriers @xmath17(averaged over momentum directions ) are small enough to allow the main contribution to the resistance of the system to be due to the barrier resistances . </S>",

    "<S> it is clear that the quantum nature of the tunneling processes becomes more pronounced if the tunneling rates @xmath23are comparable with the characteristic scale of the quasiparticle energy , @xmath24 because under this condition the classical notion of a quasiparticle whose dwell time should be longer than its energy , loses its sense . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the green s function approach enables one to obtain the quantum kinetic equations as given in @xcite which are valid beyond the classical limits , i.e. when the quasiparticle energy is not large compared to the tunneling rate . note that under the conditions ( [ c1 ] ) the proximity effect , i.e. the influence of @xmath7and @xmath25electrodes on the condensate wave function and on the order parameter in the @xmath3 region , is strong . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that unusual features of transport properties are due to the significant role of andreev reflection processeses in the considered system . </S>",
    "<S> these processeses occur in the presence of two potential barriers ( at @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and the superconducting order parameter which has a two - step form :  @xmath28 @xmath29 , where @xmath30is the phase difference between the superconductors arising at non - zero voltage , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the heavyside function . as a result , the energy dependent transmission coefficient @xmath33 of quasiparticles with energy @xmath34 , that determines the current at low temperatures , appears to be a function strongly dependent on @xmath31 through the voltage dependence of @xmath35 and @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> we also study the zero bias conductance as a function of the phase difference between the @xmath1 electrodes in a quasiparticle tunneling interferometer with two superconducting electrodes coupled by a mesoscopic superconductor @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the amplitude of the conductance oscillation may exceed the conductance of this structure in the normal state .      </S>",
