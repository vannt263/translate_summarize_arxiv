    "importance of the exponentially varying morse potential @xcite in context of vibration - rotation states of diatomic molecules has been realized in an enormous amount of work ever since its inception about 85 years ago .",
    "the celebrated empirical potential has witnessed many important applications in various branches , such as molecular physics , solid - state physics , chemical physics , etc @xcite .",
    "this potential has been studied also in several other contexts .",
    "for example , its generalized and photon - added coherent states are discussed @xcite ; series solution for @xmath6-dimensional schrdinger equation with more potential presented @xcite ; controllability with a compact group su(2 ) put forth @xcite ; a series expansion solution of position - dependent mass is given @xcite ; a proper quantization rule where the energy spectra is determined only from its ground - state energy has been proposed @xcite ; also its momentum representation by hypergeometric function is suggested @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , exact analytical results are available only for @xmath1 states , while the rotational morse oscillator states must be approximated .",
    "thus over the years , a large number of attractive efficient methodologies have been developed for better understanding of this model potential employing a multitude of approximations .",
    "one of the earliest definitive attempts to estimate the accurate solution of this physically significant potential was made in @xcite . through a modified morse technique ,",
    "reasonably good approximate semi - analytic eigenstates were reported for both non - rotating and rotating cases in h@xmath3 , which were complemented by finite - element results .",
    "thereafter , numerous attempts have been made , introducing a variety of analytical approximations as well as numerical techniques .",
    "some of the notable ones are mentioned here .",
    "the assumption that the effective potential for a rotating morse potential always retains a morse form , was used in @xcite to derive better approximate analytic expressions for energy levels , wave functions and other relevant matrix elements in h@xmath3 .",
    "a shifted 1/n expansion @xcite was used for eigenvalues in h@xmath3 .",
    "later , a modified shifted large - n approach @xcite restored exact analytical expressions of @xmath1 states and produced quite decent results for @xmath7 eigenstates in h@xmath3 , hcl , co and lih molecules . a variational method @xcite in the context of super - symmetric quantum mechanics was proposed to obtain energies and eigenfunctions of lowest levels in these molecules .",
    "a super - symmetry improvement @xcite of the pekeris approximation @xcite allowing one to obtain a higher ro - vibrational state from a lower ro - vibrational state , was successfully employed for h@xmath3 .",
    "bound - state eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of diatomic molecular systems in the rotating morse oscillator have been presented @xcite by a combination of nikiforov - uvarov method and pekeris approximation as well . in another development @xcite ,",
    "analytical solution for eigenstates in h@xmath3 molecule was provided by means of a two - point quasi - rational approximant technique .",
    "also , the use of a pekeris approximation within asymptotic iteration method has been advocated for eigenvalues @xcite and eigenfunctions @xcite for above diatomic molecules .",
    "further , through a tridiagonal j - matrix representation @xcite , quite impressive results for arbitrary @xmath8 states of morse potential have been reported . a quantization rule @xcite within the framework of pekeris approximation",
    "has offered analytical bound states for arbitrary @xmath9 quantum numbers in hcl , co and lih molecules . in another attempt , approximate",
    "analytic bound states for generalized q - deformed morse oscillator were elegantly obtained by a parametric generalization @xcite of the nikiforov - uvarov method in conjunction with pekeris approximation .",
    "it is well known that the radial schrdinger equation of this potential can be solved exactly for @xmath1 states only . moreover ,",
    "several highly accurate methods are available for pure vibrational levels ; e.g. , confining the system in a spherical box of certain finite radius @xcite , asymptotic iteration method @xcite , besides the original prescription of morse @xcite .",
    "however for the rotating morse scenario , exact explicit expressions of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are not available in closed form .",
    "while some of the above mentioned approximate analytic , semi - analytic or numerical methods produce good quality results for @xmath1 states , only a very few of these can offer same for arbitrary @xmath2 states .",
    "additionally , much attention has been paid for ground states , while excited states are reported less frequently and definitively . moreover , while all these methods consider eigenvalues , eigenfunctions have received much less attention relatively .",
    "thus , a simple general prescription which could deliver physically meaningful and accurate results for low as well as higher states ( eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ) in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 situations , would be highly desirable . in this letter",
    ", we examine such a possibility through the generalized pseudospectral ( gps ) method .",
    "this approach has been very successful for a variety of potentials of physical interest , including the spiked harmonic oscillator , rational , logarithmic , power - law , hulthn , yukawa as well as for atoms , molecules with coulombic singularity , etc .",
    ", as documented in the following references @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this letter is , therefore , two - fold : ( a ) to make a detailed study on the bound - state spectra of morse potential with special reference to diatomic molecules for arbitrary @xmath9 quantum numbers , ( b ) assess the validity , applicability and performance of gps method for molecular potentials , which has not been done before . to this end , accurate ro - vibrational spectra is presented for four diatomic molecules ( h@xmath3 , lih , hcl , co ) with much emphasis on the energy variations .",
    "a thorough comparison with literature data has been made wherever possible .",
    "the letter is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the essential details of our methodology employed here . a discussion of our results is given in section 3 while section 4 makes a few concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we present an overview of the gps method employed to solve the radial eigenvalue problem with morse potential .",
    "as it has been described before @xcite , here we provide only the essential steps ; details could be found in the references above .",
    "the desired radial schrdinger equation can be written in the following operator form , @xmath10 where the hamiltonian operator includes usual kinetic and potential energy operators , @xmath11 here @xmath8 denotes the usual angular momentum quantum number identifying rotational states .",
    "last term in eq .",
    "( 2 ) represents the morse potential .",
    "potential strength @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are two positive parameters .",
    "a large number of numerical schemes for solution of above radial schrdinger equation employ finite - difference discretization .",
    "these often require a significant number of spatial grid points chiefly because of their uniform distributional nature . in the gps method",
    ", however , a nonuniform optimal spatial discretization could be achieved efficiently as detailed below , maintaining similar kind of good accuracy at both small and large @xmath15 regions .",
    "therefore it requires much lesser grid points to reach convergence , compared to many other methods in the literature .",
    "one can have a denser mesh at smaller @xmath15 while a coarser mesh at large @xmath15 regions .",
    "a primary feature of this scheme is that a function @xmath16 in the interval @xmath17 $ ] can be approximated by an n - th order polynomial @xmath18 as given below , @xmath19 this approximation is _ exact _ at the _ collocation points _",
    "@xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 . in the legendre pseudospectral method used in this work",
    "we also have , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , while @xmath24 are obtained from roots of first derivative of @xmath25 with respect to @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 . the cardinal functions @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) are given by following expression , @xmath29 thereby satisfying a unique property @xmath30 .",
    "the semi - infinite domain @xmath31 $ ] is now mapped into a finite domain @xmath17 $ ] by employing the transformation @xmath32 . now invoking an algebraic nonlinear mapping of the form , @xmath33 with l and @xmath34 as mapping parameters , and introducing a symmetrization procedure leads to a transformed hamiltonian as below ,",
    "@xmath35 the advantage is that this leads to a _",
    "matrix eigenvalue problem which can be readily solved to obtain accurate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . for the particular transformation",
    "used above , @xmath36 .",
    "so , finally one obtains the following set of coupled equations ,    @xmath37 a_j = ea_{j'},\\ \\ \\ \\ j=1,\\ldots , n-1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath38^{1/2 } \\psi(r(x_j))\\ \\left [ p_n(x_j)\\right]^{-1 } , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   d^{(2)}_{j'j } =   \\left[r'(x_{j ' } ) \\right]^{-1 } d^{(2)}_{j'j }   \\left[r'(x_j)\\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath39 a sufficiently large number of test calculations were done to check the performance of this method with respect to the mapping parameters .",
    "results are reported here only up to the precision that were found to maintain stability with such variations . in this way , a consistent set of numerical parameters of @xmath40 , @xmath41 were chosen , which seemed to be appropriate and satisfactory for our purposes . in general , @xmath42 a.u .",

    "once the accuracy and reliability of our method is established , we now investigate the variation of energies in different states .",
    "for that , in fig .  1 ,",
    "representative plots are given , where ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) in left panel correspond to the changes in bound - state energies ( in ev ) of h@xmath3 , lih , co , with respect to the vibrational quantum number @xmath57 at six selected @xmath8 values , _ viz . _ , 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 . figures ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) in the right - hand panel signify corresponding energy changes ( in ev ) of h@xmath3 , lih and co molecules with respect to rotational quantum number @xmath8 at six selected @xmath57 values , namely 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 and 15 ( for h@xmath3 , only the first five @xmath57 ) respectively .",
    "while the @xmath8 axis in ( d)(f ) has been kept fixed at 25 , the @xmath57 axis in ( a)(c ) , on the other hand , has been varied to capture the necessary qualitative structures in these plots .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that this potential supports a limited number of bound states for these molecules ; the estimated @xmath58 for the three molecules under consideration being 17 , 29 and 83 @xcite respectively .",
    "plots for hcl is not presented here as its qualitative features remain quite similar to that in lih . to our knowledge ,",
