    "frequency - stable lasers are indispensable tools for precision measurements , finding applications ranging from optical frequency standards @xcite and tests of fundamental physics @xcite to geodesy @xcite and low - phase - noise microwave synthesis @xcite .",
    "typically , lasers for such applications are stabilized by locking them to a fabry - prot cavity such that the fractional frequency stability of the laser is determined by the fractional length stability of the cavity @xcite .",
    "such cavity - stabilized lasers are sensitive to environmental perturbations that change the length of the cavity , including vibrations and temperature fluctuations , and much effort has gone into designing cavities that are less sensitive to accelerations @xcite and shielding them from temperature fluctuations @xcite . for applications outside the laboratory , such as clock - based geodesy @xcite , it is desirable to further reduce the sensitivity of laser frequencies to environmental perturbations .",
    "a complementary approach to the passive reduction of the vibration sensitivity of cavity - stabilized lasers has been demonstrated @xcite in which the acceleration environment is measured and real - time feed - forward is applied to correct the frequency of the laser for the acceleration - induced frequency fluctuations .",

    "we extend this approach to include feed - forward that corrects for first- and second - order deformations of the cavity due to all of the ( rigid body ) inertial forces , namely rotational velocity as well as linear and rotational acceleration , with a bandwidth that extends to zero frequency ( 0300  hz ) . in addition",

    ".    the cavity mount is improved over the one used in ref .",
    "stainless steel 304 flexure springs hold the cavity at two points on a diameter of the spherical spacer that is orthogonal to the optical axis .",
    "the springs are designed such that the rigid - body motional modes of the sphere within the mount are at frequencies of a few hundred hertz .",
    "this is a compromise between holding the sphere stiffly in order to maintain alignment of the laser to the cavity mode in the presence of @xmath4 acceleration changes , and holding the sphere weakly in order to reduce transmission of stresses due to vibrations and thermal expansion from the mount to the cavity ( @xmath5 = 9.8  m / s@xmath6 ) .",
    "we calculate the frequencies of the rigid - body motional modes of the cavity using finite - element analysis to be at 280  hz ( translation along the mounting axis ) , 340  hz ( rotation about the mounting axis ) , 430  hz ( translation along the orthogonal axes ) , and 690  hz ( rotation about the orthogonal axes ) . for reference ,",
    "the lowest internal mechanical resonance of the spherical spacer is near 50  khz .",

    "this design takes advantage of the high thermal conductivity of aluminum and the low emissivity of nickel to ensure a uniform and stable temperature .",
    "the zero crossing of the cavity s coefficient of thermal expansion ( cte ) is at approximately -17  @xmath14c , and we actively stabilize the temperature of the vacuum - chamber wall at 24  @xmath14c by use of a thermo - electric cooler ( tec ) .",

    "typically , the laser stays locked for days at a time , and the laser optics were adjusted only once during the approximately one - year time period when data in this paper were collected .",
    "we measure inertial forces and temperature drift , which perturb the length of the cavity , both to characterize the environmental sensitivity and to correct for the corresponding frequency perturbations of the laser via feed - forward to the frequency of an aom .",
