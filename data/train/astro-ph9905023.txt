    "our knowledge of the galactic magnetic field at present is primarily based on studies of the distribution of rotation measures of pulsars or extragalactic sources and optical observations of polarized star light ( e.g. wielebinski  @xcite , beck et al .",
    "in addition , early radio polarization surveys at low frequencies have revealed substantial linear polarization from the diffuse galactic emission , implying the general presence of ordered magnetic fields .",
    "however , these early results were limited by low angular resolution and sensitivity .",
    "also faraday rotation effects are significant at low frequencies .",
    "a polarimetric survey of the northern galactic plane has been made by junkes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and duncan et al.(@xcite ) at 2695  mhz with the effelsberg 100-m telescope .",
    "complementary observations have been made with the parkes 64-m telescope of a strip of the southern galactic plane at 2400  mhz by duncan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . these observations revealed polarized emission of the diffuse galactic radiation .",
    "at least some of these emission features are believed to originate at distances up to a few kpc ( junkes et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the medium and high latitudes of the galaxy have not been studied in a systematic way .",
    "surprisingly , observations at 327  mhz by wieringa et al .",
    "( @xcite ) carried out with the westerbork radio telescope revealed filamentary polarized structures on a degree scale .",
    "these high galactic latitude features are not detected at higher frequencies and have no counterpart in total intensity .",
    "recently , gray et al . (",
    "@xcite ) detected at 1.4  ghz an interstellar faraday rotation feature about @xmath3 in size located in front of the prominent region w5 .",
    "these results call for a systematic observational approach .",
    "there exist already a galactic plane survey at 1.4  ghz ( reich et al .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ) carried out with the effelsberg telescope , which covers absolute galactic latitudes of @xmath4 .",
    "however , this survey does not include measurements of linearly polarized intensities .",
    "meanwhile , a new sensitive receiver is available and we have started a sensitive survey of the radio continuum and polarized emission at medium galactic latitudes with the effelsberg telescope .    in a first paper ( uyaniker et al .",
    "1998 ,  @xcite ) we have described the methods of observation and data reduction .",
    "in addition , we explained the procedure of absolute calibration of both the total intensity data from the stockert 1.4  ghz survey ( reich  @xcite , reich & reich@xcite ) and the linear polarization data by 1.4  ghz observations made with the dwingeloo 25-m telescope ( brouw & spoelstra@xcite ) . the medium latitude effelsberg survey aims to observe regions at galactic latitudes ( @xmath5 ) accessible to the telescope .    the areas presented in this paper cover four fields . from the first galactic quadrant",
    "an area of @xmath6 centered on @xmath7 has been observed . here",
    "the dwingeloo polarization data could not be used because of a low s / n - ratio in general .",
    "the cygnus - x area is the second region .",
    "this field includes the cygnus superbubble , which is particularly bright in x - ray emission .",
    "the third area is the highly polarized region just above the galactic plane between @xmath8 . in the anticentre",
    "a field of @xmath9 centered on @xmath10 , @xmath11 was surveyed .",
    "for this region no dwingeloo polarization data are available for an absolute calibration .    in sect .",
    "2 we summarize some technical aspects . in sect .",
    "3 we show that the total intensity data are limited by confusion and we compare counts of compact sources with those based on the recent 1.4  ghz nvss survey . the total intensity and polarimetric observations are displayed in sect .  4 , where in addition some comments on the individual fields are given .",
    "the observations have been made with the two channel hemt 1.31.7  ghz receiver installed in the primary - focus of the effelsberg 100-m telescope .",
    "the method of observation is to scan each field along galactic latitude and longitude .",
    "both coverages are combined as described in @xcite .",
    "the half - power - beam - width at 1.4  ghz is @xmath12 .",
    "the conversion factor from main beam brightness temperature t@xmath1 to flux density / beam area is @xmath13 .",
    "details of the data reduction are given in @xcite , where we also describe the method to reduce the instrumental polarization to a level of about 1% .",
    "the total intensity maps have been calibrated to an absolute scale using the stockert 1.4  ghz survey and the polarization data by dwingeloo 1.4  ghz data .",
    "unfortunately , the dwingeloo survey is incomplete .",
    "for some areas the data are severely undersampled or a have a low s / n - ratio .",
    "all total intensity survey maps show a large number of compact sources , which are mainly of extragalactic origin .",
    "we have selected several small flat and empty fields from the survey maps and subtracted sources when necessary .",
    "the measured rms - noise is typically about 15  mk  t@xmath1 .",
    "no problem with confusing sources exists for polarized intensities , where a typical rms - noise value of 8  mk  t@xmath1 has been found .",
    "the measured rms - noise in total intensity is about a factor of three larger than that calculated from the system temperature of about 30  k. source confusion is believed to be the limiting factor in sensitivity .",
    "condon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have studied the effect of source confusion for the former 300-ft green - bank telescope , which is described by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is in ghz and @xmath16 is the rms of intensity fluctuations in units of mjy/300-ft beam area . when calculating the expected confusion for the 100-m telescope from that approach we get about 16  mjy or 35  mk  t@xmath1 at 1.4  ghz , which is significantly larger than the measured rms - noise of 15  mk  t@xmath1 in the maps .",
    "we conclude that source confusion is significantly smaller than previously thought , but it is limiting the sensitivity for total intensities of the survey .",
    "we have performed source counts from the survey maps based on a fitted two - dimensional gaussian to each source .",
    "these counts have been compared with counts based on the recent 1.4  ghz vla - survey ( nvss ) by condon et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which is more sensitive to compact sources than our survey and suffers less from confusion due to its smaller beam size .",
    "we convolved a vla map covering about @xmath17 to the angular resolution of the effelsberg map and applied the same source fitting procedure to both maps . in fig .",
    "[ scall ] we show cumulative source counts for a region in the galactic anticentre .",
    "we have also fitted the vla data at their original angular resolution and found 910 sources in total .",
    "the corresponding cumulative source counts are also shown in fig .  [ scall ] with a slope of about @xmath18 .",
    "this is close to the expected value of @xmath19 for a uniform source density in the local universe",
    ". source evolution and different source populations cause deviations from the @xmath19 slope for sources weaker than about 100  mjy ( see condon et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "below about 40  mjy the fraction of sources which can not be fitted individually increases with decreasing flux density . for the effelsberg data as well as for the convolved vla data we obtain the same result over the entire flux density range .",
    "however , the deviation from the straight line starts already near 100  mjy .",
    "this effect is caused by the much larger confusion in the low resolution data : the total number of sources stronger than 10  mjy found in the original vla data results in a mean source separation of about 22  vla beam areas , but just about 1.8  beam areas of the 100-m telescope .",
    "therefore , flux densities lower than about 100  mjy source counts are more complete , when using the original vla data . with decreasing flux density an increasing fraction of sources can not be fitted individually due to increasing confusion effects .",
    "we present the results of our observations in the form of contour and grey - scale maps .",
    "the maps are also available in fits - format via internet ( http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/survey.html ) .    when adding the absolutely calibrated large - scale emission to the effelsberg data in both total and polarized intensity , much of the small - scale details are hidden in large - scale intensity gradients .",
    "we therefore separated the small and large - scale structures from each other using the `` background filtering method '' ( sofue & reich@xcite ) , which is based on an unsharp masking operation .",
    "this procedure has been applied to all absolutely calibrated total intensity maps .",
    "we separated emission on scales larger than about @xmath2 from compact sources and emission on smaller scales .",
    "the sum of both components is exactly the original intensity .",
    "this procedure and presentation of data has been already applied for the effelsberg galactic plane surveys at 1.4  ghz ( reich et al .",

    "this field of @xmath20 is located between the north polar spur to the west and the cygnus - x region to the east , which both contain strong emission from local sources .",

    "no sensitive radio surveys of the area of the cygnus superbubble exist so far and we will discuss the relation of the x - ray emission revealed by rosat during its all - sky survey with the 1.4  ghz radio emission in a forthcoming paper . highly varying and strong polarized intensity is seen in some areas , where the total intensity images show rather smooth emission . in particular the regions centered around @xmath25 south of the cygnus loop ( @xmath26 ) ,",
    "the large emission feature almost filling the field of view and crossing the map diagonally and the structure at @xmath27 about @xmath2 in size should be mentioned .",
    "some well - known polarized objects are visible .",
    "these are three supernova remnants : the cygnus loop , hb21 ( @xmath28 ) and w63 ( @xmath29 ) . at @xmath30 the exceptionally strong emission from the radio galaxy cygnus  a shows up .",
    "telescope sidelobes from the four support legs of the subreflector show up to about @xmath4 distance from the source in total intensity ( fig .",

    "[ g146 ] shows the area from @xmath8 similar to fig .",

    "to separate the small - scale polarization structures , the strong sources are clipped in the absolutely calibrated u and q maps and these maps are convolved to @xmath2 .",

    "[ g146_pi ] ( small - scale emission ) and fig .",
    "[ g146back2 ] ( large - scale emission ) , respectively .",
    "early polarization surveys as reviewed by salter & brown ( @xcite ) already revealed an outstanding polarized region with more than @xmath21 in extent centered roughly at @xmath31 and slightly north of the galactic plane . because of its morphology this area has been referred to as the `` fan region '' .",
    "the polarized emission is believed to be of local origin .",
    "the derived rotation measures are small ( e.g. bingham & shakeshaft  @xcite ) and the magnetic field direction has to be basically orientated perpendicular to the line of sight",
    ". however , in addition to the large - scale component , which we add from the dwingeloo survey , a lot of small - scale variations are visible ( fig .",
    "[ g146_pi ] ) .",
    "[ antitp ] to fig .",
    "[ antiback ] display the results of the anticentre region north of the galactic plane .",
    "color images ( fig .",
    "[ antitp_col ] ) of the total intensity and polarization intensity in the direction of the galactic anticentre show the polarization features and absence of corresponding total - power emission in detail .",
    "although an absolute calibration of the polarized emission on large scales was not possible because of missing dwingeloo data , significant small - scale polarization is found across the area .",
    "the most remarkable structures are apparently depolarized features ( fig .",
    "[ antitp_col ] ) , which form filaments ( e.g. at @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) or ring - like structures ( e.g. at @xmath34 or at @xmath35 ) with sizes up to about @xmath2 .",
    "the depolarized features have no counterpart in the small - scale total intensity emission ( fig .  [ antitp ] ,  [ antitp_col ] ) or the large - scale component ( fig .  [ antiback ] ) .",
    "depolarization can be caused either by some filamentary thermal matter with enhanced electron density , by magnetic field variations in strength and/or direction or the superposition of magnetic field components in the line of sight with orientations perpendicular to each other .",
    "higher frequency observations with the 100-m telescope are underway to clarify the nature of these features .",
    "the maps shown include information on a wealth of faint emission structures at medium galactic latitudes .",
    "the total intensities decrease quickly with increasing distance from the plane as is expected for a thin disk of emission .",
    "strong sources become rare , but faint extended ridges , arcs and more or less structured discrete emission regions are seen superimposed on the still dominating unresolved galactic emission .",
    "there is substantial diffuse polarized emission seen in all the observed fields .",
    "this emission is characterized by fluctuations on angular scales of the beam size up to several degrees .",
    "interestingly , there exist significantly polarized regions of the order of several degrees in size , which have no corresponding structures in the total - power emission .",
    "moreover , within the polarized emission there are numerous nearly straight , loop or arc shaped structures , which seem to be depolarized .",
    "they are most pronounced in the direction of the galactic anticentre , where the line of sight across the galaxy is comparably short . in these regions , the total intensity of diffuse galactic emission as revealed from the stockert 1.4  ghz survey is less than 0.5  k. in view of the observed polarized intensities of up to 0.25  k , there are also areas with well organized magnetic fields and quite small faraday rotation effects .",
    "the most likely explanation for the small - scale structures are significant spatial variations of the faraday rotation by the interstellar medium in the line of sight , which modulate a significantly polarized smooth galactic diffuse emission .",
    "it is not clear whether fluctuations of the galactic magnetic field or changes in the electron density are the reason for that .",
    "we conclude that probing the properties of the diffuse galactic emission via a polarization survey is a promising tool towards the improvement of our current understanding of the galaxy and the local ism .",
