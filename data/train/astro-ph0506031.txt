    "radio millisecond pulsars ( msps ) form a separate class of rotation - powered pulsars , characterized by small spin periods , @xmath0 ms , and spin - down rates , @xmath1 , implying surface magnetic field strengths of @xmath2 gauss and characteristic ages of @xmath3 years .",
    "these neutron stars ( nss ) are widely believed to be the end products of a more exotic channel of binary evolution , involving an extended period of accretion of matter and angular momentum from a close stellar companion in x - ray binary systems @xcite .",
    "after a period of @xmath4 years , they acquire millisecond spin periods and after accretion ceases are reactivated as radio pulsars .",
    "this theory is supported by the fact that over @xmath575% of the known msps in the galactic disk are found in binary systems , whereas this is the case for only @xmath5  1% of the general pulsar population .",
    "the strongest support so far for the connection between msps and x - ray binaries comes from the discovery of coherent millisecond x - ray pulsations in the low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) transient sax j1808.43658 @xcite and subsequently five other systems ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "however , a firm connection between the two classes of objects is yet to be established as no lmxb has been detected as a radio pulsar and no msp has shown x - ray properties of a quiescent lmxb ( qlmxb ) .",
    "the globular cluster 47 tucanae ( ngc 104 , henceforth 47 tuc ) is known to host at least 22 radio millisecond pulsars ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "many of these msps , however , have flux densities below the sensitivity of the parkes radio telescope used to detect them and are only observable on rare occasions when strong interstellar scintillation focusing effects bring them above the detection limit .",
    "thus , to date , 17 of the 22 msps have been detected sufficiently frequently to allow a precise determination of their positions from radio timing solutions . during the only radio observation in which psr j00247204w ( henceforth 47 tuc w or msp w ) was detected ,",
    "this 2.35-millisecond pulsar was found to be in a 3.2 hour binary orbit and to undergo eclipses but its position could not be determined accurately @xcite .",
    "fortunately , _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) observations of 47 tuc have been used to match the binary period and phase of the modulations of a variable star with that of msp w and thus determine the position of the msp with sub - arcsecond precision @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the optical counterpart of 47 tuc w was found to be a @xmath6@xmath7 m@xmath8 main sequence star , which is unexpected for a msp binary companion since in all but one other case the secondary star is greatly evolved .",
    "this intriguing result implies that either the companion is the star that very recently finished spinning up msp w or that it is not the original secondary star but was instead exchanged for the low - mass ( @xmath90.1 m@xmath8 ) companion , which , in the process , was liberated from the binary .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "identification showed msp w to be positionally coincident with the x - ray source w29 , first detected by a 72-kilosecond _ chandra x - ray observatory _ acis - i observation of the core of 47 tuc @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was found to be relatively hard , suggestive of non - thermal emission , atypical of the msp sample in 47 tuc , but similar to psr j17405340 in the globular cluster ngc 6397 @xcite , the only other known msp with a non - degenerate stellar companion .",
    "we have employed the superb spatial resolution of _ chandra _ and _ hst _ to further investigate the unusual properties of the 47 tuc w system .",
    "the x - ray dataset consists of four additional 65-kilosecond observations of the core of 47 tuc performed with the _ chandra _ acis - s instrument .",
    "these deep observations have resulted in the detection of @xmath5300 sources within the half - mass radius of 47 tuc @xcite including the x - ray counterparts for each of the msps with known positions @xcite .",
    "the optical _ hst _ data consist of three sets of archival observations acquired with the high resolution camera ( hrc ) on the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and one set of observations performed contemporaneously with the _ chandra _ observations using the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the acs .",
    "table 1 summarizes all x - ray and optical observations used in this analysis .",
    "the primary difference between j1808 in quiescence and 47 tuc w is the lack of radio pulsations from the former .",
    "one possibility is that the radio beams are not favorably oriented , rendering j1808 undetectable at radio wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , the radio signals from the nascent msp expected in j1808 could be obscured by a diffuse circum - binary envelope of material , formed by the gas flowing out from the companion that is ultimately expelled from the system by the pulsar wind .",
    "such an envelope is likely present around the 47 tuc w system as well and may explain , in part , why this msp is occulted for @xmath540% of the orbit and is rarely detected at radio frequencies @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , it would be yet another common feature of the two systems .",
    "we propose that the great similarities in the values of the power law index and the non - thermal x - ray luminosity derived for 47 tuc w and j1808 point to a common origin of the non - thermal x - ray emission in both systems . also , it is highly probable that the source of energy supplied to the heated companion in both systems is the same as well is @xmath9@xmath10 ergs s@xmath11 , as measured 2 days before the optical observations . ] . if this is indeed the case , then , as originally suggested by @xcite and @xcite , in the j1808 system there exists a pulsar wind , powered by the rotational energy of the ns , which is constraining the outflow of material from the companion and preventing its accretion onto the ns . as in the 47 tuc w system ,",
    "the presence of this relativistic particle wind is manifested via the non - thermal x - ray emission produced by interaction of this wind with matter flowing out from the companion , as well as through the optical variability caused by heating of one side of the tidally - locked companion . by analogy",
    ", this would exclude an accretion disk ( e.g * ? ? ? * and references therein ) or a propeller mechanism as the source of hard x - rays in j1808 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , since we know that in 47 tuc w accretion is inhibited by the pulsar wind .",
    "the remarkable similarities between 47 tuc w and j1808 provide strong support for the claim that in episodes of quiescence , the ns in the qlmxb system j1808 has already been reactivated as a rotation - powered millisecond pulsar .",
    "this , in turn , gives indirect evidence in favor of the long - standing hypothesis that lmxbs are indeed progenitors of msps .",
    "the implications of the 47 tuc w system on studies of x - ray source populations are profound since low luminosity ( @xmath12 ergs s@xmath11 ) hard x - ray sources , which would otherwise be classified as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , i.e. accreting white dwarf systems @xcite , may , instead , be msp binaries in some cases . the same holds true for the low luminosity , hard spectrum qlmxbs categorized as black hole ( bh ) systems @xcite based on the absence of thermal emission of a cooling ns .",
    "the optical heating effects of the pulsar wind , as seen in 47 tuc w , would allow msps to be discovered and distinguished from cvs or bh qlmxbs since for both the low x - ray luminosities and the absence of an energetic wind do not result in significant heating of the secondary star for comparably short orbital periods .",
    "we note also that the discriminant of x - ray to optical flux ratios , @xmath13 , which might be used to distinguish qlmxbs from cvs or msps is not useful for these transition qlmxb - msp systems : j1808 and msp w have @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , which are typical values for cvs or qlmxbs but much larger than a `` typical '' msp with an evolved companion . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding value for msp u in 47 tuc , whose companion is likely a helium white dwarf @xcite , is @xmath16 @xcite .",
