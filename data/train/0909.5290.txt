    "in the context of nonequilibrium physics , simple systems of interacting particles have been received considerable attention recently , and it has been known that the concept of duality is useful in studying stochastic processes of interacting particle systems @xcite .",
    "the duality would give deep insights and analytical results for stochastic models in nonequilibrium , and actually , there are many works using duality properties , ranging from calculations of correlation functions in interacting particle systems @xcite to studies of biological population models @xcite .",
    "while the duality is a useful concept , there are some problems to use it . for example",
    ", it has been sometimes necessary to construct a dual process with ad - hoc procedures .",
    "in addition , while the original process and the dual one are connected via a duality function , the duality function should be selected properly . to construct the duality function ,",
    "usually one sets an ansatz for the duality function , and checks whether the ansatz satisfies the dual relation or not .",
    "recently , a general procedure to derive a duality function has been proposed @xcite ; dual relations for various stochastic models have been recovered using the symmetries of the original process .",
    "while this general procedure has wide applications , it may be needed to use a heuristic way for some specific cases .",
    "for example , the general procedure in @xcite may not be available for brownian momentum ( or energy ) processes in boundary driven cases , and a boundary part in a duality function was heuristically found in @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we show a new scheme to obtain a dual process and a duality function .",
    "the scheme is based on a boson representation , and it is applicable to a case in which a generator of the stochastic process is expressed by boson creation and annihilation operators .",
    "we will see that a continuous time markov process with _ discrete _ state space ( e.g. , simple birth - death processes and discrete random walk models ) is a dual process of a continuous time markov process with _ continuous _ state space ( e.g. , stochastic differential equations and brownian momentum models ) . in the derivation of the duality function , the generating function approach and the doi - peliti method",
    "it will be clarified that the dual process and the duality function are naturally derived by using bosonic coherent states as a bra state in the doi - peliti method , instead of a usual projection state .",
    "in addition , using a boson realization of @xmath0 , it is also possible to study a duality relation for a stochastic model with elements of the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "especially , we can derive a duality function for a brownian momentum process with boundaries not heuristically , but deductively .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a definition of duality . the new scheme to derive a dual process and a duality function",
    "is shown in section 3 .",
    "sections 4 and 5 are applications of the new scheme to two examples ; i.e. , a simple birth - coagulation process and a brownian momentum process .",
    "section 6 gives concluding remarks .",
    "general discussions for duality are given in @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we only treat the duality between birth - death processes ( or discrete random walk models ) and diffusion processes .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are continuous time markov processes on state spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath5 denotes the expectation given that the process @xmath1 starts from @xmath6 .",
    "the process @xmath1 is said to be dual to @xmath2 with respect to a duality function @xmath7 if for all @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 we have @xmath11 where @xmath12 is expectation in the process @xmath2 starting from @xmath13 .    in the following discussions and examples , the process @xmath1 is a continuous time markov process denoting a birth - death process ( or a discrete random walk model ) , so that @xmath14 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dual process @xmath2 is a continuous time markov process with continuous variables , and then @xmath15 .",
    "in this section , we derive a duality function . in order to obtain it ,",
    "we firstly explain a correspondence between a generating function approach and the doi - peliti method ( second quantization method ) .",
    "after that , it will be shown that a duality function is naturally obtained from a state vector for the continuous time markov process with discrete state space .",
    "some stochastic models with discrete variables are described as birth - death processes .",
    "a time evolution of a birth - death system obeys a master equation , and it is sometimes useful to treat a generating function instead of the original master equation @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we here treat a birth - death process with only one variable . the generating function @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the probability with @xmath21 particles at time @xmath22 .",
    "the time evolution equation for @xmath16 is written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a linear operator , which is constructed from the original master equation .",
    "the doi - peliti method is a well - known approach to investigate birth - death systems @xcite . in the doi - peliti method , bosonic",
    "creation and annihilation operators are used : the creation operator @xmath25 and annihilation operator @xmath26 satisfy the commutation relations @xmath27 = 1 , \\quad [ a , a ] = [ a^\\dagger , a^\\dagger ] = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and each operator works on a vector in fock space @xmath28 as follows : @xmath29 the vacuum state @xmath30 is characterized by @xmath31 .",
    "the inner product of bra state @xmath32 and ket state @xmath28 is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the kronecker delta .    when we define a time - dependent state @xmath35 as @xmath36",
    "is given by @xmath37 which recovers the original master equation .",
    "the linear operator @xmath38 is obtained from the original master equation , and it is known that @xmath38 in ( [ eq_time_evol_for_doi_peliti ] ) has the same form as @xmath24 in ( [ eq_time_evol_for_generating_function ] ) .    while the doi - peliti method is similar with usual quantum mechanics ,",
    "there are some differences .",
    "one of the big differences is the usage of a projection state . in the doi - peliti method ,",
    "the projection state @xmath39 is used to obtain physical quantities .",
    "for example , the average of @xmath21 is given by @xmath40 .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the generating function approach and the doi - peliti method .",
    "consider the following construction for ket and bra states in the doi - peliti method : @xmath41 and interpret the creation and annihilation operators as follows : @xmath42 hence , we immediately see that all properties in the doi - peliti method are recovered using @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , the linear operator @xmath38 in ( [ eq_time_evol_for_doi_peliti ] ) is obtained by replacing @xmath43 and @xmath44 of @xmath24 in ( [ eq_time_evol_for_generating_function ] ) with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "because of the correspondence between the generating function approach and the doi - peliti method , we will switch between these two notations freely in the following discussions .      for simplicity , a case with only one variable",
    "is discussed at first .",
    "after that , a result for general cases will be given .",
    "we consider the following time evolution equation @xmath45 where @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 here , @xmath6 is a variable used in a continuous time markov process with discrete state space ( @xmath48 ) , whose probability distribution is denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "note that the state @xmath50 is not restricted to the form discussed in section 3.2 , and @xmath50 is generated using the creation operator @xmath25 via a function @xmath51 .",
    "for example , we will see the following functions @xmath51 in sections 4 and 5 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 . in both cases ,",
    "the state @xmath50 is expressed in terms of the creation operator @xmath25 , but it is not necessary to use the simple construction @xmath54 in section 3.2 .    as explained in section 3.2 , the projection state is usually used as an adequate ` bra ' state in the doi - peliti formalism .",
    "the key point to obtain a duality function here is the following one ; instead of the projection state , we define a bra state @xmath55 as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a coherent state of @xmath25 : @xmath58 which satisfies @xmath59 and @xmath13 is assumed to be a real variable . from the correspondence between the generating function approach and doi - peliti method , the following identities are easily checked : @xmath60 @xmath61 the linear operator @xmath38 ( i.e , @xmath24 ) is generally written in normal order , i.e. , all creation operators are to the left of all annihilation operators in products .",
    "hence , @xmath62 \\langle z | , \\label{eq_time_evol_tilde_phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is obtained by simply replacing @xmath43 and @xmath44 as @xmath13 and @xmath64 , respectively ; @xmath65 is the adjoint operator of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the following identity : @xmath66 where the time development of the bra state @xmath55 is defined as @xmath67 combining ( [ eq_time_evol_tilde_phi ] ) and ( [ eq_time_evol_bra ] ) , we have @xmath68 at this stage , it is clarified that the linear operator @xmath69 is a generator for the continuous time markov process @xmath2 if @xmath70 can be considered as the time - dependent probability density .",
    "hence , a continuous time markov process with discrete state space , @xmath1 , is naturally connected to the stochastic process with continuous variables @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , writing ( [ eq_duality_pre ] ) explicitly , we have @xmath71 hence , if we set the initial conditions for @xmath6 and @xmath13 as a kronecker delta function and a dirac delta function respectively , the duality relation ( [ eq_duality ] ) is obtained .",
    "it is also clear that the function @xmath72 gives a duality function .",
    "the above discussion means that if a generator @xmath69 is expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators , a dual process is immediately constructed and the duality function is given by the function @xmath72 , which specifies a state @xmath73 in the markov process with discrete state space ( see ( [ eq_def_of_states ] ) ) .",
    "if a markov process with discrete state space has many variables @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , a state @xmath50 is defined by @xmath76 where @xmath77 may be different from each other .",
    "hence , using @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 , a duality function is given as @xmath82",
    "as a first example , we apply the scheme in section 3 to a simple birth - coagulation process . the birth - coagulation process has been used widely to study front - propagation problems , and it has been known that a langevin equation , so - called stochastic fisher and kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( sfkpp ) equation , plays an important role in the study of the front - propagation problems @xcite .",
    "recently , the sfkpp equation has been discussed even in a qcd context @xcite .",
    "a duality relation for the birth - coagulation process has been used to study a front propagating problem in @xcite . in the duality relation ,",
    "the birth - coagulation process is connected to a langevin equation . in @xcite ,",
    "the dual process and the duality function were assumed , and explicit calculations based on stochastic differential equations were used to check the duality relation .",
    "we will show that the dual process and the duality function are recovered simply using our general scheme .",
    "in addition , we will derive a new duality relation for a slightly - changed stochastic process .",
    "the derivation demonstrates the effectiveness of the present scheme to find a new duality relation .",
    "consider the following reaction scheme for the birth - coagulation process : @xmath83 the master equation for the birth - coagulation process is written as @xmath84 where @xmath6 is the number of particle @xmath85 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the linear operator in the doi - peliti method is given by @xmath86 and it is easy to check that the following time evolution equation and a bra state @xmath87 recover the master equation ( [ eq_ex1_master_equation ] ) : @xmath88 , a duality function is @xmath89 considering the adjoint of the linear operator @xmath69 in terms of @xmath13 and @xmath64 , @xmath90 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d } z^2 } \\left [ \\sigma^2 ( 1-z ) z \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that the adjoint operator @xmath91 gives a fokker - planck equation .",
    "hence , the dual process corresponds to the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath92 if one consider a new process via a variable transformation @xmath93 , the corresponding stochastic differential equation is @xmath94 and the duality function is rewritten by using the new variable @xmath95 as @xmath96 the above dual process and the duality function are consistent with results in @xcite .",
    "we here show that it is easy to derive a new duality relation for a slightly - changed reaction scheme , which has not been studied yet .",
    "we consider that the following reaction is added to the stochastic system ( [ eq_ex1_process ] ) : @xmath97 hence , a new term , @xmath98 , is added to the master equation ( [ eq_ex1_master_equation ] ) .",
    "the corresponding linear operator in the doi - peliti method is @xmath99 , and then the adjoint operator @xmath100 is finally given by @xmath101 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d } z^2 } \\left [ \\sigma^2 ( 1-z ) z \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we conclude that the dual process is given by the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath102\\mathrm{d } t + \\sigma \\sqrt{z(1-z ) } \\mathrm{d } w,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the duality function is given by ( [ eq_ex1_duality_function ] ) .",
    "as a next example , a brownian momentum process is studied @xcite . in this case ,",
    "different from example 1 in section 4 , we start from a stochastic process with continuous state space and obtain a dual process with discrete state space .",
    "the model is defined as a stochastic process on @xmath103-dimensional vectors @xmath104 , which have to be interpreted as momenta associated with lattice sites @xmath105 .",
    "in addition , sites @xmath106 and @xmath103 are in contact with heat reservoirs at temperature @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the process is defined by a generator @xmath69 as follows : @xmath109 with @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a @xmath112 function .",
    "hence , the time - dependent probability density @xmath113 obeys the following equation : @xmath114 where @xmath115 the above equation corresponds to a stochastic process with continuous state space @xcite .",
    "it has been known that the generator @xmath69 is rewritten by using elements ( operators ) of the @xmath0 algebra @xcite .",
    "the operators are defined by @xmath116 and they satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath117 = \\pm k_i^{\\pm } , \\quad [ k_i^{- } , k_i^{+ } ] = 2 k_i^0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the components of the generator @xmath69 is rewritten as @xmath118 in addition , the @xmath0 group admits a discrete ( infinite dimensional ) representation : @xmath119 here , we reinterpret the operators @xmath120 and @xmath121 as follows : @xmath122 where we interpret the constants @xmath107 and @xmath108 as the creation operators related to additional sites @xmath123 and @xmath124 ; @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "this reinterpretation is justified according to the correspondence between the generating function approach and the doi - peliti method ( see section 3.3 ) . using the introduction of the bosonic creation operators for sites @xmath123 and @xmath124 and the @xmath0 algebra for the other sites , it is possible to consider that the generator @xmath69 creates a stochastic process with discrete state space .",
    "we define , for @xmath8 , @xmath127 , the configuration @xmath128 to be the configuration obtained from @xmath6 by removing one particle at @xmath129 and adding one particle at @xmath130 .",
    "hence , the linear operator @xmath69 is interpreted as @xmath131 + 2 \\xi_1 ( 2\\xi_2 + 1 ) [ \\psi(\\xi^{1,2})-\\psi(\\xi ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sum_{i=2}^{n-1 } \\big ( 2\\xi_i ( 2\\xi_{i-1}+1 ) [ \\psi(\\xi^{i , i-1 } ) - \\psi(\\xi ) ]   + 2\\xi_i ( 2\\xi_{i+1}+1 ) [ \\psi(\\xi^{i , i+1 } ) - \\psi(\\xi ) ] \\big ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + 2 \\xi_n ( 2\\xi_{n-1 } + 1 ) [ \\psi(\\xi^{n , n-1})-\\psi(\\xi ) ] + 2 \\xi_n [ \\psi ( \\xi^{n , n+1 } ) - \\psi(\\xi ) ] , \\label{eq_generator_ex2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 is an arbitrary function of the finite particle configurations .",
    "this process is considered as a discrete random walk model with absorbing sites @xmath123 and @xmath124@xcite .",
    "hence , a stochastic process with continuous variables ( the brownian momentum process ) is naturally connected to a stochastic process with discrete variables ( discrete random walk model ) .",
    "next , we obtain the duality function . using ( [ eq_discrete_representation_of_su11 ] ) iteratively",
    ", it is easy to confirm that a state @xmath133 for @xmath134 is given by @xmath135 is the vacuum state in the @xmath0 representation . here",
    ", we note that there are boson representations for the operators in @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath136 ( see also ( [ eq_def_of_su11 ] ) . )",
    "hence , it is possible to rewrite state @xmath133 by using boson creation operators instead of @xmath137 . on the other hand , for site @xmath123 and @xmath124",
    ", it is necessary to indicate a state @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) by using the creation operator @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) instead of @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) ; i.e. , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath146 \\right ) \\otimes \\left (   ( a^\\dagger_{n+1})^{\\xi_{n+1 } } | 0 \\rangle_{n+1 } \\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means @xmath147 and then we immediately have a duality function as ( note that @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) @xmath150 which is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , a new scheme to obtain a dual process and duality function was given ; the scheme is applicable when a generator is expressed in terms of boson representation . using the new scheme , it is possible to find the duality function not heuristically , but deductively using a state expression for a continuous time markov process with discrete state space .",
    "the duality connects the markov process to the dual process with continuous state space .",
    "we applied the scheme to two examples , and adequately recovered results in previous works , and derived a new duality relation for a slightly - changed stochastic process .",
    "we here note that the same scheme is available to obtain a duality function in a brownian energy model in @xcite , and we confirmed that a suitable duality function is actually obtained .",
    "our analysis in the present paper was limited to simple cases in which a representation of the @xmath43-representation is changed to the @xmath21-representation . in @xcite ,",
    "the role of symmetries was considered , which then leads to self - duality for discrete processes .",
    "the key idea in our scheme is a usage of coherent states as a bra state , instead of a conventional projection state .",
    "although we here limited ourselves to cases with boson representation , the similar idea will be also applicable to other cases .",
    "for example , it will be possible to apply the similar discussions to a case with a generator with the @xmath151 algebra ( or the quantum algebra @xmath152 $ ] ) , which describes symmetric ( or asymmetric ) simple exclusion processes @xcite .",
    "such extensions are out of the scope of the present paper ; these issues are currently under investigations and will be published in future .    finally , we comment on the applicability of the scheme .",
    "the scheme would basically connect a discrete representation and continuous one , and give a duality function between them .",
    "however , there may be no guarantee that a corresponding dual ` process ' adequately describes a stochastic process ; e.g. , it is necessary for markov processes with discrete state space to have the generators with some specific forms ( see ( [ eq_generator_ex1 ] ) and ( [ eq_generator_ex2 ] ) ) . in our scheme , it is at least possible to derive a differential equation with continuous variables , which may not be interpreted as a stochastic process . the derived differential equation and the original markov process",
    "is adequately connected via a ( duality ) function , which is simply given from a state expression for the markov process , as discussed in the present paper",
    ". such ` duality ' between a stochastic process and a deterministic differential equation would be valuable for studies of nonequilibrium physics .",
    "in addition , the present formalism based on the generating function and doi - peliti method would be tractable for physicists , and then it will help to seek new duality relations for stochastic processes .",
