    "the velocity of a solid sphere immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid after a sudden small impulse , starting from a state of rest , shows two conspicuous features as a function of time . at very short times",
    "the velocity is less than one would expect from its bare mass , due to added mass equal to half the mass of displaced fluid@xcite@xmath0@xcite . at long times the velocity relaxation function decays with a @xmath1 power law with a universal coefficient which is independent of the mass of the sphere , its radius , and the boundary condition at the surface@xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the behavior at intermediate times does depend on these properties .",
    "for an understanding of the dynamics of polymer solutions it is of interest to study similarly the velocity relaxation function of a single polymer immersed in a viscous solvent . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the initial impulse is sufficiently small , so that low reynolds number hydrodynamics applies .",
    "debye and bueche@xcite first studied the steady - state friction coefficient of a polymer , modeled as a uniform permeable sphere immersed in a viscous fluid .",
    "the fluid flow was described by the stokes equations with an added darcy type term corresponding to the local friction caused by relative motion of polymer beads and fluid@xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "it was found that in the limit of an impermeable sphere the friction coefficient tends to the stokes value for a sphere with no - slip boundary condition . in earlier work",
    "we have generalized the calculation to a polymer model with more general radial dependence of the permeability@xcite . in the following",
    "we calculate the time - dependent velocity relaxation function of a uniform permeable sphere on the basis of the linearized navier - stokes equations with an added darcy type drag term .    for values of the ratio of permeability screening length to sphere radius less than unity",
    "the velocity relaxation function differs significantly from that of a solid sphere with no - slip boundary condition .",
    "surprisingly , in contrast to the latter case , the added mass is found to vanish , so that the polymer after the sudden impulse starts off with a much higher velocity than a sphere with no - slip boundary condition and the same radius and same bare mass .",
    "if the screening length is small compared to the radius , the velocity decays in the initial stage rapidly to a much smaller value .",
    "the initial decay corresponds to a sharp peak in the relaxation spectrum . on the other hand , for large screening length the velocity relaxation",
    "is well described by a simple approximation corresponding to two poles of the admittance in the complex plane of the square root of frequency , determined by mass and steady - state translational friction coefficient .",
    "then the relaxation spectrum is characterized by a single narrow peak and the relaxation function is nearly exponential .",
    "we also study the relaxation of rotational velocity after a sudden small twist . again",
    "the velocity relaxation function for a permeable sphere differs markedly from that of a solid sphere with no - slip boundary condition .",
    "if the screening length is small compared to the radius , the rotational velocity decays in the initial stage rapidly to a much smaller value , and again the initial decay corresponds to a sharp peak in the relaxation spectrum . on the other hand , for large screening length the velocity relaxation",

    "show the well - known universal behavior with an algebraic long - time tail , identical to that of a no - slip sphere .    via the fluctuation - dissipation",
    "theorem@xcite the velocity relaxation functions are directly related to the velocity autocorrelation functions of brownian motion@xcite@xmath0@xcite . presently the translational autocorrelation function can be studied experimentally in detail@xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to apply the same experimental methods to the brownian motion of a spherically symmetric polymer .",
