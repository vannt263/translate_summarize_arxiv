    "the enormous progress in this field is documented in recent review articles by coey et al.,@xcite nagaev,@xcite and salomon and jaime.@xcite in addition to their technological potential the manganites also represent an enormous and fascinating playground for basic solid - state research : unconventional and exotic ground states are established via the competing interplay of the internal degrees of freedom , like spin , orbital momentum , charge , as well as lattice degrees of freedom.@xcite    in this communication we report on structural details , on susceptibility , magnetization and heat capacity of single crystalline la@xmath2gd@xmath3mno@xmath0 and , hence , our focus is directed towards the isovalent doping of the a - site in @xmath4mno@xmath0 , with @xmath4 denoting the rare - earth elements lanthanum ( 4f@xmath5 ) or gadolinium ( 4f@xmath6 ) . from a general point of view",
    ", the rare - earth manganites can be grouped into two classes : the compounds from la to dy ( with the exception of ce and pm ) , characterized by larger ionic radii , reveal an orthorhombic perovskite - derived structure , while the compounds from ho to lu crystallize in a hexagonal structure , not related to the perovskites.@xcite focusing on the first group , when going from la to dy manganite , the tolerance factor decreases with the decrease of ionic radii and the buckling and tilting of the ideal cubic structure becomes stronger.@xcite consequently the mn - o - mn bond angles are reduced resulting in a strong suppression of the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering temperature of the mn subsystem , from 140 k for lamno@xmath7 to 40 k for tbmno@xmath7 and the corresponding transformation of the mn magnetic structure from an antiferromagnetic layer a - type ordering with a weak ferromagnetism ( a@xmath8f@xmath9 ) ( la , pr , nd ) @xcite to an incommensurate sinusoidal structure ( tb).@xcite at the same time , the jahn - teller ( jt ) transition , i.e.  the orbital - order transition , which is well below 1000  k in lamno@xmath0 , is shifted to values of almost 1500  k in tbmno@xmath0.@xcite however , strong hysteresis effects , domain reorientation , history dependence , oxygen diffusion , and oxidation processes do not allow a precise determination of the jt transition temperatures.@xcite    the magnetic moments of the rare - earths ions are polarized due to the coupling with the mn subsystem resulting in a noticeable anisotropic contribution to the low - temperature magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the manganites as we have recently reported for prmno@xmath0 and ndmno@xmath0.@xcite the coupling within the rare - earth sublattice is antiferromagnetic and rather weak . in many cases",

    "<S> the magnetism of la@xmath2gd@xmath3mno@xmath0 is dominated by the relatively strong mn - o - mn superexchange . for increasing gd doping the weakening of the nearest - neighbor exchange interactions due to the significant decrease of the mn - o - mn bond angles leads to the continuous suppression of the magnetic phase - transition temperature into the a - type antiferromagnetic low - temperature phase . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the magnetization can only be explained assuming canting of the manganese spins . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moments of gd are weakly antiferromagnetically coupled within the sublattice and are antiferromagnetically coupled to the mn moments . for intermediate concentrations compensation points are found , below which the spontaneous magnetization becomes negative . </S>",
    "<S> in pure gdmno@xmath0 the mn spins undergo a transition into a complex , probably incommensurate magnetic structure at 41.5  k , followed by a further ordering transition at 18 - 20  k revealing weak ferromagnetism due to canting and finally by the onset of magnetic order in the gd sublattice at 6.5  k. at the lowest temperatures and low external fields both magnetic sublattices reveal a canted structure with antiparallel ferromagnetic components . </S>"
