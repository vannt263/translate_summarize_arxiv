    "equilibrium time correlation functions of particle density and momentum density are important to the kinetic theory of liquids@xcite because their long time behavior can be related to various bulk transport coefficients and because they can be measured in scattering experiments and easily calculated in molecular dynamics simulations , making them useful in determining the accuracy of a theory that can calculate them .",
    "time correlation functions of dynamical variables can be expressed as the solutions of formally exact integro - differential equations that typically contain a term in which the correlation function is convoluted in time with its memory function.@xcite if the memory function is known , the correlation function can be computed easily , but the memory function is generally too complicated to be evaluated exactly . consequently , much theoretical effort has been expended throughout the last several decades to come up with tractable approximation schemes for memory functions that lead to reasonable results for their corresponding correlation functions .",
    "many correlation functions of interest contain the effects of physical processes that take place on different time scales .",
    "this separation of time scales may allow one to express the memory function as the sum of a short time component and long time component and make approximations to the two components separately .",
    "one of the most fruitful applications of this general strategy is the mode coupling theory of gtze and coworkers,@xcite who were interested in constructing a long time scale theory of a two - point density correlation function .",
    "they approximated the short time part of its memory function as a function proportional to a dirac delta function of time .",
    "they approximated the long time part of the memory function as a four - point density correlation function that was then further approximated self consistently as a product of two two - point density correlation functions .",
    "sjgren@xcite also developed a kinetic theory that hinged on separating the memory function into a short and long time part . using the fully renormalized kinetic theory of mazenko@xcite as a starting point",
    ", sjgren assumed that the short time scale dynamics were dominated by binary collisions and that the long time scale dynamics consisted of recollisions and hydrodynamic backflow and used these assumptions as the basis for his separation .",
    "this had the advantage of allowing him to derive formal expressions for both the short and long time parts of his memory function , but the cost of trying to describe the dynamics on all time scales simultaneously was that these expressions were extremely cumbersome and difficult to evaluate .",
    "andersen@xcite much later developed a formally exact diagrammatic kinetic theory for correlation functions of phase space densities , some of whose features and results were closely related to those of mazenko s fully renormalized kinetic theory .",
    "the diagrammatic theory had the advantage of being able to represent both correlation functions and their memory functions in a unified way in terms of diagrams that could be ascribed straightforward physical interpretations thanks to the individual elements of the diagrams being relatively simple ( even though the full diagrams in general were not ) .",
    "andersen and coworkers@xcite then used the physical intuition this theory afforded to derive several candidate graphical representations of the short time part of the memory function of the phase space density correlation function that could be evaluated numerically and used to compute the short time behavior of several correlation functions of interest .",
    "each of these representations in turn implied an explicit diagrammatic series for the corresponding long time part of the memory function , but these series were always too complex to evaluate .    in this paper",
    "we develop a new method for characterizing the multiple time scale behavior of simple atomic liquids that are in what we call the ` overdamped limit ' . for the following qualitative discussion ,",
    "let us regard the unit of time for an atomic liquid to be the ratio of the particle diameter and the mean thermal velocity and express all times in terms of that unit .",
    "let @xmath0 be the average rate at which a particle in the fluid experiences uncorrelated binary repulsive collisions .",
    "then @xmath1 is approximately the relaxation time for fluctuations in a particle s momentum at equilibrium .",
    "the overdamped limit is defined by the assumption that the short ranged repulsive forces of the particles are hard enough and the density is high enough that uncorrelated binary repulsive collisions randomize the velocities of the particles on a time scale much smaller than 1 . in the overdamped limit , @xmath0 is large compared with 1 , and @xmath1 is small compared with 1 .",
    "we start from the exact diagrammatic theory for the correlation function of phase space density fluctuations and focus on the diagrammatic series for a projected propagator associated with its memory function . after a number of renormalizations ,",
    "one of which makes use of a short time theory equivalent to the generalized enskog theory for hard spheres , we obtain a graphical formulation for the projected propagator that shows that its magnitude and time dependence is of the form @xmath2 where the function @xmath3 has only nonnegative powers of its two arguments .",
    "the two terms vary on two very distinct time scales .",
    "the first term decays very rapidly to 0 , on a time scale of @xmath4 .",
    "this is the time scale for randomization of the momentum of a particle by uncorrelated binary repulsive ( or hard sphere ) collisions .",
    "the second term varies on a time scale of @xmath5 .",
    "this is the time scale for a particle to diffuse a distance equal to its diameter when its self diffusion coefficient is @xmath4 , which is the value determined by the repulsive collisions .",
    "if @xmath0 is large and @xmath6 , it is reasonable to approximate the behavior of the projected propagator as @xmath7 . in the diagrammatic theory",
    ", this corresponds to retaining only a small subset of the diagrams in the original series for the projected propagator .",
    "these diagrams are characterized topologically , and from that point on , the theory works only with the diagrams that vary on the long time scale of @xmath5 and that are lowest order in powers of @xmath1 .",
    "we note that szamel@xcite has derived a diagrammatic kinetic theory for brownian particles undergoing diffusive motion in a solvent , using methods similar to those used in deriving the diagrammatic kinetic theory for particle systems undergoing hamiltonian dynamics.@xcite szamel s results and the present results have several parallels .",
    "however , it should be noted that szamel s method starts from the theory of smoluchowski dynamics in a solvent whose microscopic dynamics is not explicitly discussed , whereas the present work starts from hamiltonian dynamics for a one component particle system and shows how the longer diffusive time scale arises from a mechanical description that includes all the shorter time scales and all the degrees of freedom of the system .    in sec .",
