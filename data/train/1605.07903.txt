    "in this talk i first discuss a novel method @xcite to determine the leading order hadronic contribution to @xmath14 of the muon , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this allows for a purely theoretical determination based on qcd , thus avoiding the use of @xmath1 annihilation data , which are affected by many uncertainties .",
    "the method consists in replacing the well known integration kernel @xmath15 , entering the expression for the anomaly @xmath0 , by a fit function having simple poles in the complex square energy @xmath16 plane at @xmath17 . invoking cauchy s residue theorem in this plane ,",
    "@xmath0 is fixed by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and the residues of the poles . in the heavy - quark sector ( charm and bottom ) the well known pqcd expansion of the vector current correlator around @xmath17 fixes these residues .",
    "the predictions from this method in the charm- and bottom - quark regions were later fully confirmed by lattice qcd ( lqcd ) determinations@xcite-@xcite . regarding the leading contribution from the light - quark sector , the derivatives of the vector current correlator at @xmath17 were estimated in the framework of a large @xmath18-qcd model of the pion form factor @xcite . while the result was fully consistent with the expectation from the standard model ( sm )",
    ", it clearly remains a model - dependent result .",
    "current preliminary results from lqcd for the first derivative of the vector current correlator at the origin @xcite , which dominates the result by roughly an order of magnitude , lead to a complete theoretical prediction of the anomaly .",
    "the result is substantially larger than values obtained using @xmath19 data .",
    "if the lqcd results from @xcite were to be confirmed , then it would be possible to understand the muon @xmath14 value within the standard model .",
    "+ further support for the view that the culprit in the @xmath20 saga could be the @xmath1 data ( in the light - quark sector ) is provided by a second approach to the determination of the anomaly @xcite , also to be discussed here .",
    "this consists in using the operator product expansion ( ope ) of current correlators at short distances , plus a finite energy qcd sum rule ( fesr ) designed to quench the role of the @xmath1 data .",
    "a clear tension between the ope and @xmath1 data was identified , suggesting a cross - section deficit in these data .",
    "while not solving completely the discrepancy between theory and experiment , this approach reduces it by at least 40% .",
    "+ since qcd fesr and the ope , which rely on quark - hadron duality , have lately been questioned @xcite , a specific model of duality violations requiring six free - parameters @xcite was used in @xcite in order to check this issue .",
    "our results @xcite were fully consistent with no duality violations taking place , at least in this application .",
