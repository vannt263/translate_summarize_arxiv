    "star clusters are considered as important tracers for understanding the formation and evolution of their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "star cluster systems have been traditionally separated into two populations ",
    "globular clusters and open clusters ( gcs and ocs)on their ages , masses , metallicities , and positions .",
    "however , more recent studies have discovered that the distinction between gcs and ocs becomes increasingly blurred ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "@xcite listed photometric colors and magnitudes for star clusters in magellanic clouds ( mcs ) and the fornax dwarf system and divided them into two groups .",
    "they found that star clusters in blue group have central condensation properties similar to those of the red group , which were considered as gcs , however they could not be identified with the galactic ocs .",
    "@xcite termed 23 clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc)differing from gcs in their relative youth and ocs in their richness and shape  as `` young populous clusters '' , which were called `` young massive clusters '' ( ymcs ) or `` blue luminous compact clusters '' ( blccs ) by @xcite .",
    "actually , the blue integrated colors for a cluster may be influenced by several factors , such as poor metallicity ( the luminosity of the horizontal branch ) , young age ( the position of the main - sequence turnoff stars ) , and some exotic stellar populations ( e.g. , blue stragglers , wolf - rayet stars ) .",
    "however , several studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have reached similar conclusions that the exceedingly blue colors of blccs are a direct consequence of their young ages ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "m31 is the largest galaxy in the local group , and has a large number of star clusters , including young clusters having been studied by many authors .",
    "@xcite listed 11 objects in m31 classified as blue clusters using the uv colors , most of which have been proved to be young clusters @xcite , except for b133 and b145 , which were stated as a star and an old gc @xcite , respectively .",
    "@xcite derived ages and masses for a large sample of young clusters , and found that these star clusters are less than 2 gyr old , and most of them have ages between @xmath10 and @xmath11 yr and masses ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "these authors also stated that the young star clusters in m31 show a range of structures , most of which have low concentrations typical of ocs in the milky way ( mw ) , however , there are a few with high concentrations similar to the mw gcs .",
    "@xcite carried out a survey of compact star clusters in the southwest part of m31 , and suggested a rich intermediate - mass star cluster population in m31 , with a typical age range of 30 myr @xmath14 3 gyr , peaking at @xmath6 70 myr . in order to ascertain the properties of the blccs",
    ", @xcite performed an image survey for 20 blccs lying in the disk of m31 using the wide field and planetary camera-2 ( wfpc2 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "in addition , another key aim of this _ hst _ survey was to determine the fraction of contamination of blccs by asterisms , since @xcite suggested that a large fraction of the putative blccs may in fact be just asterisms .",
    "@xcite presented the resulting @xmath15 images of six very young or young star clusters in m31 observed with the keck laser guide star adaptive optics system , and indicated that the four youngest out of these six objects are asterisms .",
    "however , @xcite presented a conclusion that these four objects are true clusters based on spectra .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "images @xcite showed that nineteen of the twenty surveyed candidates are real star clusters , and one ( nb67 ) is a bright star .",
    "@xcite measured surface brightness profiles for 23 bright young star clusters using images from the wfpc2 , including the sample clusters of @xcite , and derived the structural properties by fitting the surface brightness profiles to several structural models .",
    "the authors stated that the sample young clusters are expected to dissolve within a few gyr and will not survive to become old gcs , and that young star clusters in m31 and mcs follow the same fundamental plane relations as old gcs of m31 , mcs , the mw and ngc 5128 , regardless of their host galaxy environments .",
    "@xcite presented a m31 stellar cluster catalog utilizing the panchromatic hubble andromeda treasury survey data , which will cover @xmath16 of m31 disk with multiple filters and allow the identification of thousands of star clusters .",
    "the large population of young star clusters reflect a high efficiency of cluster formation , possibly triggered by a current interaction event between m31 and its satellite galaxy @xcite , suggesting that young star clusters should be associated with the star - forming ( sf ) regions of m31 .",
    "@xcite found that young clusters ( @xmath17 2 gyr ) are spatially coincident with m31 s disk , including the 10 kpc ring and the outer ring @xcite .",
    "although these authors also found the young star clusters in the halo of m31 , all of the clusters outside of the optical disk of m31 are old , globular clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "@xcite stated that most of young star clusters kinematics have the thin , rotating disk component ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the young star clusters distribution has a distinct peak around @xmath18 kpc from the center in m31 disk , and some young star clusters show concentration around the 10 kpc ring splitting regions near m32 and most of them have systematically younger ages ( @xmath19 myr ) . @xcite also stated that the young star clusters show a spatial distribution similar to ob stars , uv sf regions , and dust , all of which are important tracers of disk structures .",
    "several criteria were developed for selecting young clusters from the integrated spectrum and colors .",
    "@xcite comprehensively studied the properties of 67 very blue and likely ymcs in m31 selected according to their color @xmath20 $ ] and/or the strength of @xmath21 spectral index ( @xmath22  ) .",
    "@xcite presented a catalog of m31 gcs based on images from the sdss and the wide field camera on the united kingdom infrared telescope and selected a population of young clusters with a definition of @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "@xcite published a catalog of m31 young clusters ( @xmath24 gyr ) and supported the selection criteria @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath26 $ ] @xcite . these criterions may play important roles in distinguishing young from old clusters for those whose ages can not be derived accurately .",
    "the formation and disruption of young star clusters represent a latter - day example of the hierarchical formation of galaxies @xcite .",
    "motivated by that , we decided to describe some basic properties of young star clusters in m31 , such as positions , distributions of ages and masses , correlations of the ages and masses with structure parameters , which may provide important information about the processes involved in their formation and disruption .    in this paper , we will provide photometry of a set of young star clusters in m31 using images obtained with the beijing ",

    "we selected 178 young clusters given in @xcite , and fortunately , all the young clusters have been observed with 15 intermediate - band filters of the batc photometric system",
    ". however , there are 42 clusters for which we can not obtain accurate photometric measurements with different reasons as following , a ) some clusters have one or more nearby very bright objects ; b ) some clusters are very close to other objects ; c ) some clusters are very faint and the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is low ; d ) some clusters are superimposed onto a bright background ; e ) some clusters are superimposed onto a strongly variable background . in addition , there are several remarkable clusters with `` adhered '' @xcite objects in our images , such as m088 and its neighbor m089 , and g099 and c037-g099x ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in a previous paper , @xcite presented the seds in 15 intermediate - band filters of the batc photometric system for one ymc vdb0-b195d and determined its age and mass by comparing its seds with the theoretical evolutionary population synthesis models .",
    "thus , here we will analyze the multicolor photometric properties of the remaining 135 clusters .",
    "the m31 field is part of a galaxy calibration program of batc multicolor sky survey .",
    "the batc program uses the 60/90 cm schmidt telescope at the xinglong station of the national astronomical observatories , chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) .",

    "we processed all the ccd images to apply standard procedures including bias subtraction and flat - fielding using an automatic data reduction software named pipeline i , developed for the batc multicolor sky survey of the ccd images .",
    "batc magnitudes are defined and obtained in a similar way as for the spectrophotometric ab magnitude system @xcite . in order to improve the image quality , multiple images of the same filter",
    "were combined to one , on which the magnitudes of the sample star clusters were determined .",
    "the absolute flux of the combined images in the central field of m31 ( m31 - 1 in figure 1 ) was calibrated using observations of standard stars , while the absolute flux of the combined images of the m31 - 2 to m31 - 7 fields was calibrated based on secondary standard transformations using the m31 - 1 field ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "we performed standard aperture photometry of our sample objects using the phot routine in daophot @xcite . to ensure that we adopted the most appropriate photometric radius that included all light from the objects",
    ", we used 9 different aperture sizes ( with radii of @xmath37 pixels for the old ccd , while for the new ccd , the radii were given with pixels corresponding to the same arcsecs on the old ccd ) to determine the magnitude .",
    "we also checked the aperture radii carefully on the images by visual examination in order not to include the light from extraneous objects .",
    "the local sky background was measured in an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath38 pixel and a width of 4.0 pixels for the old ccd , and with an inner radius of @xmath38 pixel and a width of 5.0 pixels for the new ccd , respectively .",
    "there are 40 clusters in this paper which are in common with our series of previous papers @xcite , and the photometric data of these 40 clusters were also derived by these studies .",
    "we found that most photometric data obtained here are in good agreement with those obtained by previous studies .",
    "we checked the images of those clusters with photometric discrepancy , and found most of them were loaded near the bulge ( b091 ) or in some disk regions with bright or variable background ( e.g. , b210 , m020 , m023 ) . the different choice of the aperture for photometry and the annulus for background caused the discrepancy .",

    "@xcite stated that the uv photometry is powerful for age estimation of young stellar populations , and the combination of uv photometry with optical observations enables one to break the age - metallicity degeneracy . @xcite and @xcite showed that the age - metallicity degeneracy can be partially broken by adding nir photometry to optical colors ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "there were no magnitude errors for @xmath44 bands in rbc v.4 , and we obtained them by comparing the photometric data with figure 2 of @xcite , in which the photometric error was shown as a function of magnitude for stars brighter than their observational completeness limits @xcite .",
    "in addition , since rbc v.4 provided @xmath2 magnitudes only for a small number of sample star clusters , we adopted @xmath2 magnitudes from the 2mass-6x - psc catalog , with 6 times the normal exposure of 7.2 s on most fields of m31 @xcite .",

    "<S> combined with photometry in the _ galex _ far- and near - ultraviolet , broad - band @xmath0 , sdss @xmath1 , and infrared @xmath2 of two micron all sky survey , we obtain their accurate spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from @xmath3  . </S>",

    "<S> the mean value of age and mass of young clusters ( @xmath4 gyr ) is about 385 myr and @xmath5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> there are two distinct peaks in the age distribution , a highest peak at age @xmath6 60 myr and a secondary peak around 250 myr , while the mass distribution shows a single peak around @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> a few young star clusters have two - body relaxation times greater than their ages , indicating that those clusters have not been well dynamically relaxed and therefore have not established the thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> there are several regions showing aggregations of young star clusters around the 10 kpc ring and the outer ring , indicating that the distribution of the young star clusters is well correlated with m31 s star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> the young massive star clusters ( age @xmath8 myr and mass @xmath9 ) show apparent concentration around the ring splitting region , suggesting a recent passage of a satellite galaxy ( m32 ) through m31 disk . </S>"
