    "two widely studied geometric invariants of a closed connected riemannian manifold @xmath1 are the laplace spectrum and the length spectrum . the _ laplace spectrum _ ( or _ spectrum _ ) is the non - decreasing sequence of eigenvalues , considered with multiplicities , of the laplace operator acting on the space of smooth functions of @xmath2 .",
    "while the spectrum is known to encode some geometric information such as the dimension , volume and total scalar curvature , it is by now well established that the spectrum does not uniquely determine the geometry of a riemannian manifold ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in particular , in 1985 sunada devised a method that allows one to construct an abundance of isospectral manifolds by exploiting certain finite group actions @xcite , which were originally studied by gassmann @xcite .",
    "the _ length spectrum _ is the collection of lengths of the smoothly closed geodesics in @xmath1 , where the multiplicity of a length is counted according to the number of free homotopy classes containing a geodesic of that length .",
    "if we ignore multiplicities , the resulting set of non - negative numbers is known as the _ weak _ ( or _ absolute _ ) _ length spectrum_. as with the laplace spectrum , it is known that the length spectrum does not uniquely characterize the geometry of a manifold .",
    "a classical pursuit in geometry , dynamics and mathematical physics is to understand the mutual influences of the laplace and length spectra of a riemannian manifold . by using the poisson summation formula",
    "one can show that any two flat tori are isospectral if and only if they share the same length spectrum .",
    "the work of colin de verdire shows that for a generic riemannian manifold  i.e .",
    ", a manifold equipped with a `` bumpy '' metric @xcite  the weak length spectrum is determined by its laplace spectrum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , chazarain @xcite and duistermaat and guillemin ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.2 ) demonstrated that for an arbitrary riemannian manifold , the _ weak _ length spectrum contains the singular support of the trace of its wave group ( a spectrally determined tempered distribution ) .",
    "hence , the laplace spectrum always determines a non - trivial subset of the weak length spectrum of a riemannian manifold .",
    "however , the interesting and important question of whether the weak length spectrum is actually a spectral invariant remains open",
    ".    in @xcite sormani and wei introduced the covering spectrum : a geometric invariant that is related to the length spectrum of a riemannian manifold @xmath1 , and that `` roughly measures the size of the one dimensional holes in the space '' .",
    "in @xcite the covering spectrum is computed by considering a certain family @xmath3 of regular coverings of @xmath2 , where @xmath4 covers @xmath5 for @xmath6 , and selecting the values of @xmath7 where the isomorphism type of the cover changes .",
    "that is , we look for `` jumps '' in the `` step function '' @xmath8 .",
    "when viewed within this framework the definition actually applies to all complete length spaces , and sormani and wei demonstrated that the covering spectrum is well - behaved under gromov - hausdorff convergence .    in this paper",
    "we present a slightly different , yet compatible , definition of the covering spectrum that is applicable to any metric space ( see section  [ sec : covspec ] ) . in short",
    ", we form the covering spectrum of @xmath2 by assigning a non - negative real number @xmath9 to _ every _ non - trivial covering @xmath10 of @xmath2 . in the case",
    "that @xmath1 is a compact riemannian manifold this number is half the length of the shortest closed geodesic that has a lift to @xmath10 that is not a closed loop ; see corollary [ cor : geolength ] ( cf .",
    "* lemma 4.9 ) ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath11 is the universal cover of @xmath2 , then @xmath12 is half of the systole of @xmath2 .",
    "the covering spectrum of @xmath1 , denoted @xmath13 , is then defined to be the collection of all @xmath9 as @xmath10 ranges over all non - trivial covers of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is the portion of the weak length spectrum consisting of those lengths that are `` seen '' by some covering space as the length of the shortest closed geodesic having a non - closed lift .    as an example , consider the flat @xmath15 torus @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the circle of circumference @xmath18 .",
    "then one can easily verify that @xmath19 ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.5 ) . in this case",
    "we see that the covering spectrum consists entirely of half the successive minima of the corresponding lattice @xmath20 .",
    "however , as we show in example  [ exa : flattori ] this is not the case for all flat tori .",
    "having identified the covering spectrum as a geometrically determined finite part of the weak length spectrum , one may wonder about the mutual influences between the covering spectrum and laplace spectrum . along these lines , sormani and",
    "wei found that so - called komatsu pairs of sunada isospectral manifolds share the same covering spectrum ( * ? ? ?",
    "however , as we will show in section  [ sec : isospectral ] , their claim ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 10.3 ) that certain pairs of isospectral heisenberg manifolds due to gordon have distinct covering spectra is false @xcite , thus keeping alive the question of whether the covering spectrum is a spectral invariant .    by engaging in both a geometric and a group theoretic analysis of the covering spectrum and its relation to the sunada condition",
    ", we provide a negative answer to this question .",
    "specifically , we show that in dimension @xmath21 and higher there are sunada isospectral manifolds with distinct covering spectra . in dimension 4",
    "these include certain isospectral flat tori due to conway and sloane .    in closing",
    ", we briefly return to the relationship between the weak length spectrum and the laplace spectrum . as we noted above",
    ", the laplace spectrum of a manifold always determines a particular subset of its weak length spectrum , and under certain genericity conditions it is known that the laplace spectrum completely determines the weak length spectrum . however , in general , this relationship is not fully understood . in corollary  8.8 of @xcite ,",
    "sormani and wei make the interesting observation that a continuous family of manifolds sharing the same _ discrete _ weak length spectrum will necessarily share the same covering spectrum .",
    "that is , the covering spectrum is an invariant of a particular flavor of _ iso - length - spectral _ deformation . in light of the fact that we have shown that the covering spectrum is not a spectral invariant it would appear to be of interest to explore the covering spectrum of certain continuous families of _ isospectral _ manifolds in the literature .",
    "in this section , we state our main results and give an overview of the material covered in later sections .",
    "we first recall sunada s construction .",
    "let @xmath22 be a finite group , and let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be subgroups .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 acts on a closed connected manifold @xmath2 , and suppose that the action is free in the sense that every non - trivial element of @xmath22 acts without fixed points .",
    "we then consider the quotient manifolds @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which both cover @xmath27 , as indicated in figure  [ fig : sunadadiagram ] , where the labels at regular coverings are their deck transformation groups .",

    "in order to construct this metric it will be necessary to understand the extent to which length maps actually arise from minimum marked length maps of riemannian manifolds .",

    "the statement that @xmath105 implies @xmath106 in the above is a minimum - marked - length - spectrum analog of a classical theorem due to colin de verdire @xcite , which states that given a connected closed manifold @xmath2 of dimension at least @xmath21 and a finite sequence @xmath107 there is a riemannian metric @xmath82 on @xmath2 such that the sequence gives exactly the first @xmath0 eigenvalues , counting multiplicities , of the associated laplacian .",

    "the above theorem then tells us that given such a choice for @xmath99 , the @xmath99-admissibility of @xmath108 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a metric @xmath82 such that the @xmath101th smallest value of the minimum marked length spectrum is @xmath110 for @xmath111 .    with theorem  [ thm : systolelengthmap ] in place , we will complete the proof of theorem [ thm : covsunada ] in section  [ sec : proof ] . in section [ sec : groups ] we present some group theoretic context and results concerning gassmann - sunada triples ( condition @xmath31 of theorem  [ thm : sunada ] ) and jump triples ( condition @xmath37 of theorem  [ thm : covsunada ] ) .",
    "there are some key differences in the behavior of jump triples and gassmann - sunada triples .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath112=[g : h']$ ] for every gassmann - sunada triple @xmath33 , but not for every jump triple . the behavior with respect to dividing out normal subgroups",
    "is also different : if @xmath10 is a normal subgroup of @xmath22 that is contained in @xmath113 , then @xmath23 and @xmath24 are gassmann - sunada equivalent in @xmath22 if and only if @xmath114 and @xmath115 are gassmann - sunada equivalent in @xmath116 . however , as we noted earlier , @xmath114 and @xmath115 can be jump equivalent in @xmath116 even when @xmath23 and @xmath24 are not jump equivalent in @xmath22 ( see remark  [ rem : reducedtriples ] ) .",
    "while most small examples of gassmann - sunada triples turn out to be jump triples ( see example [ exa : small ] ) we will show how to adapt some well - known constructions of gassmann - sunada triples to obtain gassmann - sunada triples that are not jump triples .",
    "finally , our analysis leads us to the following conclusion in section [ sec : isospectral ] .",
