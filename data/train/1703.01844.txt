    "their interaction with matter generates torque which can be used to manipulate rings of atoms  @xcite and particles  @xcite , carry out fabrication  @xcite , provide control for spintronics  @xcite , and for many other applications as well  @xcite . at the atomic scale , the absorption of such photons can change the angular momentum state of bound electrons , only recently confirmed experimentally  @xcite",
    ". the ptc of twisted light also amounts to an additional degree of freedom for carrying information content , and ptc values in excess of @xmath4 have been experimentally realized  @xcite .",

    "beams with sam can also be converted to those with oam .",
    "staged spiral phase plates  @xcite , uniaxial crystals  @xcite , liquid crystals  @xcite , q - plates@xcite , and even metamaterials  @xcite have all been demonstrated to produce such conversions .    changing the angular momentum of photons that already have a topological charge is less standard though .",
    "such manipulations currently exploit higher - order susceptibilities to up / down convert oam along the same lines as is carried out to alter the wavelength of light .",
    "for instance , topological charge doubling via second harmonic generation ( shg ) has been demonstrated  @xcite , and ptc addition operations have also been realized using shg@xcite .",
    "topological charge can even be transferred from a pump beam to a down - converted idler beam via optical parametric oscillation ( opo ) @xcite . along the same lines , four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) with atomic vapors",

    "charge conversion is essentially instantaneous and involves two vortex beam inputs that must illuminate the target material simultaneously .",

    "intriguingly , there is a time delay between pump and probe implying that ptc is being temporarily stored in the electronic structure of the bulk crystal , but the nature of this structure was not elucidated .",

    "the requisite structures have a discrete rotational symmetry group of either @xmath5 or @xmath6 with respect to the propagation direction of light .",

    "exciton_. since both spin and circularly polarized vortex beams can be decomposed into a linear combination of radial and azimuthal vector vortices@xcite , they can create twisted excitons too .",
    "the idea is then generalized to consider the sequential excitation of molecules with pulses of light that carry either sam or oam . it is shown that the sum of ptc and etc is conserved in such processes resulting in a simple algebra in which etc can be raised and lowered using photons .",
    "subsequent emission , either spontaneous or stimulated , produces photons with the accumulated topological charge of the excitons . in this way",
    ", the excitons play the role of an angular momentum bank in which photonic charge can be deposited and withdrawn in different increments .",

    "periodicity is azimuthal and lattice points are associated with identical molecular arms .",
    "etc quantifies the molecular analog of crystalline angular momentum .",
    "we first use a tight binding ( tb ) paradigm to show that topological charge is conserved in the molecular setting .",
    "this paradigm is used to demonstrate topological charge algebra using sequential laser pulses .",

    "the angular momentum of incident electric fields may be manifested as a circular polarization , a vector vortex , or linear polarization with a scalar vortex , but we restrict attention to the first two types",
    ". an electric dipole approximation is made , and the discrete rotational symmetry ensures that a rotation of the molecule about its axis by @xmath30 maps one dipole into the next . under these conditions , the details of electric field structure and dipole orientations are irrelevant , and the light - matter interactions are well - captured by the following hamiltonians , which are functions of the topological charge of the incident light , @xmath31 : @xmath32 the _ mod _ function returns its argument modulo @xmath33 and use has been made of the fact that @xmath34 .",

    "the evolving state can then be projected onto each excitonic eigenstate to determine the population of each topological charge state , @xmath18 , as a function of time : @xmath40      within the tb setting , conservation of energy implies conservation of topological charge in association with light - matter interactions . to see this ,",
    "suppose that the molecule is initially in eigenstate @xmath41 , where subscript @xmath42 indicates an initial etc of @xmath43 .",

    "a necessary condition for this transition to occur is that @xmath48 . assuming that @xmath49 , equations [ tbstates ] and [ h12 ] imply that    @xmath50    which can be easily reduced to @xmath51    the following cyclic sum orthogonality property of periodic exponentials is then useful : @xmath52 it is applied to both terms in equation [ twoterms ] to give @xmath53    energy conservation implies that exactly one of the two kronecker delta functions will be nonzero .",
    "we therefore have the following statements of topological charge conservation : @xmath54 if the initial exciton energy is lower than that of the final state , crystal angular momentum will be removed by the light .",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "since the sign of the ptc can be either positive or negative , this allows for a number of ways in which photonic angular momentum quanta can be used to manipulate the level of excitonic angular momentum .",

    "the bottom plot is a composite of results from both simulations which shows the phase relationship between two adjacent arms before and after application of the laser pulses .",
    "the horizontal axis was obtained by rigidly translating sections of the plots of amplitude versus time so that they appear in the same time interval .",
    "then time was mapped into phase through multiplication with the associated frequencies of light . in this form",
    ", the phase relation between two arms can be easily measured by comparing the amplitude of one arm ( solid ) with its neighbor ( dashed ) .",
